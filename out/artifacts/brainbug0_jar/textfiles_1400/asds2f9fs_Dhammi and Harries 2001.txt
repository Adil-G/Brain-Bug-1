Following Brunswik (1952), social judgement theorists have long relied on
regression models to describe both an individual’s judgements and the environment about which such judgements are made. However, social judgement theory is
not synonymous with these compensatory, static, structural models. We compared
the characterisations of physicians’ judgements using a regression model with that
of a non-compensatory process model (called fast and frugal). We found that both
models fit the data equally well. Both models suggest that physicians use few cues,
that they disagree among themselves, and that their stated cue use is discrepant
with the models’ stated cue use. However, the fast and frugal model is easier to
convey to physicians and is also more psychologically plausible. Implications for
how social judgement theorists conceptualise the process of vicarious functioning
are discussed.

DHAMI AND HARRIES

In 1960, Hoffman highlighted that static, structural regression models were
paramorphic representations of human judgement behaviour. He argued that
such models “constitute a level of description and explanation which suffices for
scientific purposes ” (Hoffman, 1960, p.124). For the past 50 years, social
judgement theorists have used regression models to describe, among other
things, what information people use and how they weight and integrate it when
making decisions (Hammond, 1955; Harries, Evans, Dennis, & Dean, 1996).
Although other researchers have modelled non-linear, non-compensatory aspects
of behaviour (e.g., Brannick & Brannick, 1989; Einhorn, 1970, 1971; Ganzach,
1995), social judgement theorists have generally concluded that judgements are
the product of a linear compensatory integration of multiple cues (Brehmer &
Brehmer, 1988).
Social judgement theory is not synonymous with the use of regression models
(Hammond, 1996a; Hammond, Stewart, Brehmer, & Steinmann, 1975). Fast and
frugal process models are an alternative to regression models (Gigerenzer &
Goldstein, 1996). They imply that individuals do not integrate all relevant
information , relying instead on cue substitution, and basing their decision on
only one cue. In addition, many of these models are non-compensatory. We show
that in an applied judgement setting of individual doctors’ decisions to prescribe
a lipid-lowering drug to a set of hypothetical patients, both the fast and frugal,
and regression models fit the judgement data equally well.
Fast and frugal models are easier to understand, and are psychologically more
plausible than regression models because they are more compatible with
humans’ cognitive limitations (Kahneman, 1973, Miller, 1956, Newell & Simon,
1972) and flexible use of information. These observations have implications for
the conceptualisation of the process of vicarious functioning illustrated in
Brunswik’s (1952) lens model, which describes how individuals adapt to their
environments. However, the nature of adaptation means that humans employ
judgement strategies appropriate to the structure and demands of the task
(Hammond, 1996a, Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993), and researchers must
employ judgement models likewise.

SOCIAL JUDGEMENT THEORY AND
BRUNSWIK’S LENS MODEL

Social judgement theory does not provide any testable hypotheses regarding
human judgement, but provides a framework for investigating its nature. It is
rooted in Egon Brunswik’s (1943, 1952) theory of probabilistic functionalism
and employs Brunswik’s lens model to study applied judgement problems
(Hammond, Hursch, & Todd, 1964; Hammond et al., 1975; Hursch, Hammond,
& Hursch, 1964). Brunswik (1934, 1943, 1952) was interested in the adaptive
interaction between individuals and their environments. This approach is
illustrated in the lens model shown in Figure 1. This model presents the

<-----Page 2----->FAST AND FRUGAL VS REGRESSION MODELS

environment system and the human (or judgement) system, their relations to a set
of cues (the available information) and the relation between all of these, which is
described as achievement or accuracy (rA ).
The environment is characterised by multivariate, probabilistic cause-effect
relationships between cues (X1–Xn ) and a criterion (Ye). The imperfect ecological
or predictive validity of cues (re1 , re2 , ren ) restricts the degree of achievement of a
criterion. Moreover, the cues themselves co-vary (rX1X2 ), thus introducing
redundancy. This allows an individual to attain the same degree of achievement
of a criterion through using different cues or using the same cues in a different
way. Brunswik (1952) would have regarded this as vicarious functioning. He
also demonstrated the utility of correlational statistics, including regression
analysis, for conceptualising the process of vicarious functioning, and for
capturing both the probabilistic nature of the environment and an individual’s
adaptation to it (Brunswik, 1940, 1956).
Although social judgement theorists aim to describe the relations between
individuals and their task environment in terms of achievement, often an outcome
criterion is unavailable during the period of the study or it is considered
unfeasible or unethical to collect outcome data (Cooksey, 1996). The majority of
research therefore has focused solely on modelling the judgement system and
researchers have often compared the judgement policies of different individuals
as a measure of agreement between individuals. The ultimate aim of many social
judgement theorists is to develop cognitive aids to improve judgement, whether
in terms of an individual’s achievement or in terms of concordance between
individuals (Hammond et al., 1975).

CHARACTERISATION OF JUDGEMENT BEHAVIOUR
USING REGRESSION MODELS

In a typical study, individuals make decisions on a set of either real or hypothetical cases that comprise a combination of cues. Each individual’s judgement
policy is then inferred from his or her behaviour. When using regression models,
this means that the judgements (Ys) are regressed on the cues. This procedure
yields a weighted model that describes an individual’s judgement policy in terms
of statistically significant cues in the model, relative cue weights (e.g., rs1), the
form of the function relating the cues to the judgement (e.g., linear), the rule used
to integrate the cues into a judgement (e.g., additive), and an individual’s
predictability (a measure of cognitive control [Rs]) as measured by the model
(Cooksey, 1996). This model may then be compared with an individual’s explicit
statement of his or her judgement policy, in what traditionally is considered a
measure of self-insight (e.g., Cook & Stewart, 1976).
Social judgement theorists have applied this procedure in a variety of judgement domains including medicine (Wigton, 1996), education (Heald, 1991),
social work (Dalgleish, 1988), and accounting (Waller, 1988). Although there are

some exceptions (see Brehmer & Brehmer, 1988), a consistent picture of human
judgement has emerged from this body of research, irrespective of the number
and type of decision makers sampled, and the nature and content of the
judgement tasks studied. The findings can be summarised under the following
five generalisations:
1. Individuals are inconsistent over a set of judgements;
2. Nonetheless, they are predictable to the extent that a linear regression
model provides a good fit to their judgement data;
3. The regression models contain a handful (on average three) of statistically
significant cues;
4. There are inter-individual differences in policies; and
5. Individuals’ own accounts of their policies differ from their policies as
represented by the regression models (see Brehmer & Brehmer, 1988).
The regression model is a structural model in which the same cues are used in
the same way when deciding on each case. It describes how people weight and
combine information but not how they search for it. As Brehmer (1994) notes,
social judgement theorists believe that the regression model captures a “basic
feature of the judgmental process, viz., vicarious functioning ” (p. 141), through
the linear, compensatory, integration of multiple cues. In an environment
containing redundancy, one cue may be used vicariously to approximate another
cue. However, this model does not allow for flexibility in vicarious functioning,
whereby different cues may be substituted for each other on different cases.

Over-reliance on regression models: A “sin” of
social judgement theory

The pervasive use of regression models as a description of judgement is
surprising. First, as Doherty and Kurz (1996) note, Brunswik (1955, 1956) did
not rule out the use of other models. Second, Hammond et al., (1975) stated that
it is a misconception to think social judgement theory is “tied” to the regression
model. In fact, in recognition of the general failure to consider other models,
Hammond (1996a, pp. 244–245) recently confessed that:
a […] sin of commission on my part was to overemphasise the role of the multiple
regression (MR) technique as a model for organising information from multiple
fallible indicators into a judgement. There is nothing within the framework of the
lens model that demands that MR be the one and only model of that organising
process.

Social judgement theorists have mostly failed to consider alternative models,
such as process models, and models that imply non-compensatory and/or nonlinear processing of information. Reasons cited for this are that the regression

<-----Page 5----->10

DHAMI AND HARRIES

model has proved to be a good fit to judgement data (Brehmer & Brehmer, 1988),
is widely understood, and is useful as a cognitive aid (Stewart, 1988). However,
researchers studying judgement behaviour outside the framework of social
judgement theory have explored the descriptive validity of other types of model
(e.g., Einhorn, 1970, 1971).

ALTERNATIVES TO THE STANDARD
REGRESSION MODEL

In a regression model, cue weights may be non-compensatory and non-linear
terms may be included. However, we know of no social judgement theory studies
that have reported non-compensatory regression weights. Social judgement
theorists usually fail to investigate non-linear cue use, or when they do, they state
that non-linear terms add little to the fit of the model (Brehmer & Brehmer,
1988).
Some researchers have proposed static, structural non-compensatory, nonlinear models (e.g., Einhorn, 1970). They have found that for at least some, if not
all, of the individuals in their sample, non-compensatory models provided a
better fit to judgement data than compensatory models (Brannick & Brannick,
1989; Einhorn, 1970, 1971; Ganzach, 1995; Park, 1978). These alternative
models are not easy to interpret, and have attracted relatively little attention from
social judgement theorists.
Process-tracing techniques have proved a popular alternative to regression
analysis (see Juslin & Montgomery, 1999). While regression analysis involves
inferring information use from judgement behaviour, process-tracing involves
either elicitation of verbal descriptions of information use, or identification of the
information to which people attend by study of eye movement, information
selection, or reaction-time data. The resulting process models provide a step-bystep description of information use in terms of production rules that are easy to
understand. However, because the formation of these models is cumbersome,
researchers focus on either modelling only one participant (Einhorn, Kleinmuntz,
& Kleinmuntz, 1979) or modelling only particular tasks (Billings & Marcus,
1983). The models may also be criticised for involving artificial methods to
assess what information is searched for, and for being vulnerable to the
limitations of think-aloud methods (e.g., socially desirable responses and
difficulty in retrieving information from memory). These concerns raise doubts
about the reliability and validity of the description of judgement behaviour
provided by process-tracing techniques (Payne, Braunstein, & Carroll, 1978).
Recently, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) have proposed a class of process
models that they call fast and frugal, and that, like regression models, are formed
on the basis of the structural relationships between the cues and judgement. Thus,
they are not reliant on verbal protocols or artificial methods.

Fast and frugal models

11

Fast and frugal models were developed within the framework of probabilistic
mental models (Gigerenzer, 1993; Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Kleinbölting, 1991).
This framework embodies Brunswik’s (1943, 1952) theory of probabilistic
functionalism and Simon’s (1955, 1990) notion of bounded rationality. One of
the key principles of this is that individuals adapt to their environments. Fast and
frugal models are simple process models that do not search through all available
information , do not integrate all relevant information (relying instead on cue
substitution) , and base their decision on only one cue (Gigerenzer & Todd,
1999). Many of these models are also non-compensatory. Information search
may be random or ordered and is limited by simple stopping rules such as
stopping once the first cue that discriminates between two alternatives in a choice
task is found, so decisions are based on one cue alone.
Studies have compared the fit of fast and frugal models with regression
models on both simulated judgement data (Gigerenzer, Czerlinski, & Martignon,
1998; Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer, Todd, & the ABC research
group, 1999) and human judgement data (Rieskamp & Hoffrage, 1999, Slegers,
Brake, & Doherty, 2000). The former studies have essentially, modelled the
environment rather than judgements about the environment. In a study of this
type, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) compared a fast and frugal model for
choice tasks called Take The Best with a multiple linear regression model
(among other integration models). Using simulations the models were developed
on the basis of data contained in an almanac. The task was to choose which of two
cities was the largest in terms of population size, using a number of binary cues
such as whether or not a city has a soccer team. The relative fit of both models
was then compared on the data used to develop the models by calculating the
percentage of correct predictions. It was found that, on average, the fast and
frugal model and the regression model fitted the data equally well. Later,
Gigerenzer et al. (1998) compared the relative fit of both models on a new set of
data. They found that, in this cross-validation situation, the fast and frugal model
provided a better fit to the data than the regression model.
To date, the effectiveness of fast and frugal models as descriptions of human
judgement behaviour has been demonstrated using non-professional participants
(Rieskamp & Hoffrage, 1999, Slegers et al., 2000). Often social judgement
theorists study the professional judgement of individuals who are experienced
with a particular judgement task and who therefore have an existing policy to
model. On the other hand, studies of novices concentrate on the processes
involved in learning policies (Stewart, 1988). Dhami and Ayton (in press) compared a fast and frugal model of judgements made by professional participants
with two structural (additive) models, but did not compare it to the standard tool
of social judgement theory (regression).

<-----Page 7----->12

DHAMI AND HARRIES

We have some methodological concerns with the studies using fast and frugal
models. First, the dependent variables used in different models are not always
comparable. Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996), for example, compared a multiple
regression model that utilises a continuous measure of judgement with a fast and
frugal model that uses a binary measure of judgement. They could have used a
logistic regression model, as used by Slegers et al. (2000) on a similar task.
Second, the independent variables used are not always comparable. For example,
Slegers et al. (2000) created continuous and binary cues for the logistic
regression model and categorical cues for the fast and frugal model. Third, in
contrast to standard practice (Cooksey, 1996; Tabachnick & Fidell, 1996), most
of the findings reported are based on models that retain non-significant cue
weights. This procedure depicts the regression models as complex (i.e., multiple
cues are identified as being used). This contrasts with the literature showing that,
on average, three cues are usually statistically significant (Brehmer, 1994).
Gigerenzer et al. (1998) also did not report how many cue weights were
statistically significant. Fourth, Slegers et al. (2000) used a non-flexible fast and
frugal model that was forced to use the same one cue at a particular level each
time. That piece of information, which is not clearly identified in the paper, was
determined via logistic regression analysis. Finally, with the exception of
Hertwig, Hoffrage, and Martignon (1999), Gigerenzer and his colleagues, and
Slegers et al. (2000) evaluate the models solely in terms of global accuracy. In
many applied domains, however, global accuracy is not the first concern: the two
types of errors (Type I and Type II) are differentially weighted (see Hammond,
1996b). In medicine, for example, all tests involve a trade-off between both types
of errors.
In sum, we recognise that social judgement theory is not wedded to the use of
the regression model and we can see that fast and frugal models present a viable
alternative.

AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF
THE MODELS

We compare the relative descriptive validity of a regression model and a fast and
frugal model of professional judgement in the medical domain. We avoid the
limitations of previous research. Social judgement theorists have used regression
models to describe medical decision making (Wigton, 1988, 1996). The data we
analyse were originally reported by Harries (1995) as part of a project on medical
decision making in primary care. The full details of the method and a correlational analysis are reported in Harries, Evans, Dennis, and Dean (2000).
Here, we report a re-analysis of British general practitioners’ (GPs’) decisions to
prescribe lipid-lowering drugs for a set of hypothetical patients. We take note of
intra-individual consistency in judgements and compare the two models on the
following dimensions:

<-----Page 8----->FAST AND FRUGAL VS REGRESSION MODELS

Fit of model to judgement data;
Number and identity of cues used;
Inter-individual agreement in policies, and
Self-insight.

When managing patients and making prescription decisions, GPs must apply
guidelines in the context of a heavy workload and under time pressure. The Audit
Commission (1994) reported that the average GP saw 140 patients in a week
during surgery hours alone. The duration of an average consultation has been
found to be between 5.5 or 6.6 minutes (Morrell, Evans, Morris, & Roland,
1986). Time pressure and the desire to bring the consultation to an end have been
cited as leading to an increased frequency of prescribing behaviour (Audit
Commission, 1994). Among the drugs prescribed, lipid-lowering drugs are
particularly expensive and are a life-long prophylactic treatment. Thus, their
prescription needs to be carefully guided and monitored.
A total of 36 GPs judged their likelihood of prescribing lipid-lowering drugs
for 130 hypothetical cases. These were designed so that GPs would consider, but
not necessarily always prescribe, a lipid-lowering drug. The first 100 cases were
used to model GPs’ prescription policies. The last 30 cases were duplicates of the
first 30 and were used to measure test–retest consistency.
Each case comprised a combination of 12 cues, presented in the order shown
in Table 1. In the present analysis, the original values of the cues were simplified
to be either binary (where ordinal) or tripartite (where continuous), and were
distributed across cases as shown in Table 1. (Although the regression model can
handle continuous data, the fast and frugal model cannot.) The inter-cue
correlations among the simplified cues remained negligible (range = - 0.197 to
0.174). Although the cases are not representative as defined by Brunswik (1956),
their face validity was established.
The cases were presented in the same order to all participants to ensure
comparability across GPs. For each case, GPs indicated the likelihood that they
would prescribe a lipid-lowering drug. The response was recorded on a 0 (“very
low” ) to 100 (“very high” ) point scale. Here, this was simplified for analysis into
a binary judgement at the mid-point of the scale (i.e., 0–50% likelihood indicates
a decision not to prescribe and 51–100% likelihood indicates a decision to
prescribe).
After they had made judgements on all 130 cases, each GP rated the relative
importance of the 12 cues on a scale from zero to ten. Zero indicated that the cue
had no effect on their judgements and ten indicated that the cue had the greatest
effect on their judgements. Participants were told that cues could be assigned an
equal or zero rating.
After dichotomisation of the responses, four GPs had a constant decision
(either prescribe or not prescribe) for virtually all of the 100 cases. As they had no
policy for us to model in terms of the available case information, these GPs were

excluded from further analyses. In the remainder of the sample (N = 32), 22 GPs
made a decision not to prescribe more often than to prescribe, and 10 GPs made a
decision to prescribe more often than not to prescribe.
Intra-individual consistency was measured for each GP by calculating the
percentage of same decisions made on the 30 duplicate cases with those made on
their counterparts in the set of 100 cases. On average, the GPs made 68.59%
consistent decisions (range = 40.00–86.21). More specifically, when GPs made a
decision not to prescribe on the first presentation of a case, they also made this
decision on the second presentation of the case in on average 65.78% of the cases
(range = 10.00–94.44). They made on average 62.11% of decisions to prescribe
consistently (range = 0.00–100.00).

Development of regression models

Individual GPs’ judgement policies were inferred from their decisions made on
the set of 100 cases. First, each GP’s judgement policy was modelled using a
logistic regression analysis. In non-metric environments, such as the one
discussed here, Cooksey (1996) proposes the use of Björkman’s (1973) probability-based lens model analysis. The logistic regression analysis is comparable
to this. It is not based on covariational or correlational statistics but on probability
in terms of log odds. The independent variables were the 12 cues and the
dependent variable was the decision. The cues were entered simultaneously into
the regression equation. The logistic regression analysis indicates the predicted
probability of a patient being prescribed the lipid-lowering drug. This was coded
as the event because the guidelines for GPs outlined earlier suggest when to
prescribe rather than when not to prescribe. The probability of prescribing the
drug is:

B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + … + BpXp
the constant
the cues
the coefficient associated with each cue.

If the probability is greater than 0.50, then the model predicts that a patient is
prescribed the drug; if it is less than 0.50, the model predicts that a patient is
not prescribed the drug. The coefficients indicate the change in the log odds
associated with a one-unit change in the predictor and may be transformed into
odds for easier interpretation (see Cooksey, 1996; Tabachnick & Fidell, 1996).

<-----Page 11----->16

DHAMI AND HARRIES

There were no GPs in the sample for whom all of the cues in their logistic
regression model were significant. This suggests that testing the fit of a logistic
regression model containing all 12 cues would lead to over-fitting (Tabachnick &
Fidell, 1996). One way of reducing over-fitting is to cross-validate the model. An
alternative is to include only the significant cues in the model. There was
insufficient data to cross-validate here and so the logistic regression models
containing only the significant cues were used to make predictions. Over-fitting
was observed. The average fit in terms of judgements correctly predicted by the
models across the GPs in the sample fell by nine percentage points when only
significant cues were included. On the decisions not to prescribe, the average fit
remained the same and, on the decisions to prescribe, it fell eight percentage
points.
To provide a specific example, we use GP-1’s prescription policy as described
by the logistic regression model to predict this GP’s decision on the first case. In
this case, the patient had a cholesterol level of between 6.5 and 7.0, had
hypertension , was aged between 41 and 50 years, was female, showed evidence
of arteriosclerosis, did not drink, smoked, had diabetes, was compliant with
advice on diet, was overweight, did not request treatment, and did not have a
first-degree relative with ischaemic heart disease. The logistic regression model
for GP-1 is as follows:
z = - 3.55 + 2.29(cho) - 0.84(age) + 1.76(dri(1)) + 1.49 (smo(1)) - 2.02 (dia(1)) + 1.59(wei(1)).

Thus, on the first case, the predicted probability of the patient being prescribed
the drug according to the logistic regression model is 0.24, which is accurate
because GP-1 did not prescribe the drug in this case.

Development of fast and frugal models

We chose the Matching Heuristic model originally developed by Dhami and
Ayton (1998, see also in press) for binary categorisation tasks. This model
searches through K of the available cues in rank order of importance, looking for
a critical value on each cue that indicates a prescribe decision. If a critical value is
found, the model stops searching and predicts a prescribe decision. Otherwise,
the model searches through the value of the next rank-ordered cue. The model
continues this procedure until K cues have been searched. If by this time no
critical value has been found, the model predicts a decision not to prescribe.
Unlike in the regression model, the cues used to make a decision may differ from
case to case.
The following three steps describe how the critical values of the cues, the rank
ordering of cues, and K are determined for each GP. First, a critical value was
defined as the value of a cue that is most frequently prescribed for in the set of
100 cases. For GP-1 for example, the critical value for the cholesterol cue was
“cholesterol level of between 7.6 to 8.0” because this GP made a prescribe

<-----Page 12----->FAST AND FRUGAL VS REGRESSION MODELS

17

decision on more patients with a cholesterol level within this range than within
any other range. Therefore, despite no explicit inclusion of base rates, the critical
cue value will be affected by the fact that there were actually more patients with
a cholesterol level falling within this range in the set of 100 cases. If the absolute
frequencies of the number of cases prescribed for are equal, then the value with
the lowest absolute frequency not prescribed for is chosen. Where these are also
equal, a value is chosen randomly.
Second, a cue utilisation validity was calculated for each cue: this was defined
as the proportion of cases with the critical value for which a prescribe decision
was made. For GP-1, the validity for the cholesterol cue was calculated as the
proportion of patients with a cholesterol level of between 7.6 to 8.0 who were
prescribed for. The validities were then used to rank order the 12 cues, where the
first rank was assigned to the largest validity. This rank order indicates the order
in which the model searched through the cues. Cues with a tied rank order were
placed in the order they were presented in the judgement task.
Finally, in order to choose the maximum number of cues for the model to
search (K), the fit of the model with all 12 possible maxima was systematically
tested. The model with the best fit in terms of percentage of correctly predicted
decisions was chosen as the model of the GPs’ prescription policy. Where two or
more models had a similar fit, the most parsimonious model was chosen. As
Figure 2 shows, a model that only looked at one cue was the best fit of GP-1’s
prescription behaviour. According to the Matching Heuristic, this GP used the
cholesterol cue to predict a decision. His or her policy can be stated as follows:
“Does the patient have a cholesterol level of between 7.6 and 8.0? If yes, then
prescribe the drug; otherwise do not prescribe”. Thus, for case number one, the
Matching Heuristic would accurately predict a decision not to prescribe.
A Matching Heuristic that searched through a maximum of 1 out of 12 cues
(K = 1) proved to be the best fit for 23 GPs. For the remaining participants, K = 2
for five GPs, and K = 3, 4, 5, 6 for one GP each.

Fit of models and intra-individual consistency

We expected that less consistent behaviour would be less predictable by either
model. In fact, when the percentage of correct predictions by a model was
correlated with the percentage of consistent decisions across GPs, there was no
significant correlation between the fit of the regression models and GPs’
consistency (r = .15, N = 32, p > .05) or between the fit of the fast and frugal
models and GPs’ consistency (r = .13, N = 32, p > .05).

Fit of models to judgement data

Both models were used to make predictions on the set of 100 cases. The
regression models provided a mean fit of 73.97% (range = 30.00–92.00%), and
the fast and frugal models provided a mean fit of 74.13% (range = 60.00–

88.00%). A two-tailed paired-samples t-test revealed that there was no significant difference between their mean fit, t(31) = 0.07, p > .05. The fast and frugal
models proved a better fit than the regression models for 14 GPs, an equal fit for
3 GPs, and a worse fit for 15 GPs. (The results did not change when GP-31, who
had a regression model fit of 30% was excluded from the analysis.)
We also examined the fit of the decisions to prescribe, and not to prescribe,
separately. Of the decisions to prescribe, the mean fit of the regression models
was 66.47% (range = 27.27–95.45%), and the mean fit of the fast and frugal
models was 73.38% (range = 42.31–100.00%). There was no significant difference between the two models, t(31) = 1.85, p > .05. Of the decisions not to
prescribe, the mean fit of the regression models was 85.41% (range = 67.86–
100.00%) and the fast and frugal models provided a mean fit of 67.34% (range =
0.00–96.67%). There was a significant difference between the two models,
t(31) = 3.91, p < .001.
An analysis of the unique fit of each model compared to the shared fit is
useful. The shared fit (the percentage of cases where both models successfully
predicted the judgements) was on average 62.22% (range = 20.00–88.78%)
across the GPs. We divided the number of unique hits by the number of shared
hits, for each GP. Across the GPs, the proportion of unique hits for the regression
models (mean = 22.48%), and for the fast and frugal models (mean = 27.50%)
were both significantly different from zero (p < .01), but not significantly
different from each other, t(31) = 0.61, p > .05). (This result also held when GP31 was excluded.)

Cues used

In the regression model a cue was classified as being used if its Wald statistic was
statistically significant (p < .05), indicating that the coefficient for the cue was
significantly different from zero. In the fast and frugal model, the number of cues
used varied from case to case (unless K = 1) and so the mean number of cues used
over all of the set of 100 cases was calculated for each GP. Across the GPs, the
number of cues used according to the regression models ranged from 1 to 7
(mean = 3.13). Seven GPs used only one cue according to their regression
models. For the fast and frugal models, the mean number of cues used across the
GPs ranged from 1 to 2.10 (mean = 1.22). Significantly fewer cues were used
according to the fast and frugal models than according to the regression models,
t(31) = 6.79, p < .0001.
More GPs used cholesterol level, age, evidence of arteriosclerosis, drinking,
smoking, diabetes, compliance with advice on diet, weight, attitude towards
treatment, and family history of ischaemic heart disease in the regression models
than in the fast and frugal models. Gender and hypertension were used by more
GPs in the fast and frugal models than in the regression models.

Inter-individual agreement

Agreement is conventionally measured in terms of the similarity of judgements
made by different individuals over the same set of cases (rA—achievement
between two judgement systems) (e.g., Chaput de Saintonge & Hattersley,
1985), or the similarity of judgements predicted by different individuals’ models
(G). Kendall’s W provides a measure of concordance. A score of zero indicates
no agreement, while a score of one indicates complete agreement. Kendall’s
W(31) was 0.21 between GPs’ decisions, it was 0.43 between predictions from
the regression model, and it was 0.27 on the basis of predictions from the fast and
frugal models. There is no significance test of difference between values of the
Kendall’s W statistic.

Self-insight

Self-insight be defined in many different ways. We looked at self-insight in terms
of the number of cues used and the rank order of cues used, because these were
pertinent to our discussion. Across the whole sample, in the rating task, GPs
stated that they used from 6 to all 12 cues (mean = 10.25). This was significantly
greater than the number of cues used according to the regression models, t(31) =
17.41, p < .0001, and also greater than the number of cues used according to the
fast and frugal models, t(31) = 30.77, p < .0001.
The relative importance estimates that GPs assigned to the cues were
converted into a rank order of cues from 1 to 12, where 1 was the most important
cue. Conventionally, self-insight is measured by a correlation between an

<-----Page 15----->20

DHAMI AND HARRIES

individual’s explicit rating (or ranking) of cues and their weight (or rank)
according to their model. In the present example, this procedure would be
insensitive , as GPs used only very few cues according to both models. Instead,
we calculated the all-or-none match between the rank orders. Note that this was
done only for cues used according to each model.
None of the nine GPs who used more than one cue according to the fast and
frugal models identified all of the cues used in the same order of importance in
the rating task. For the 25 GPs using more than one cue according to the
regression models, only one identified the cues in the same order of importance
in the rating task. Of the 23 GPs who used one cue according to the fast and frugal
model, 17 rated that cue the highest. In the regression models, five of the seven
GPs who used only one cue rated that cue the highest.

HOW SHOULD THE MODELS BE DISTINGUISHED?

We have shown that both the fast and frugal models and the regression models
provided an equally good fit to the judgement data, regardless of GPs’ inconsistency. An analysis of type I and type II errors revealed that the regression
model was significantly better at predicting GPs’ decisions not to prescribe.
Compared to the regression model that contained only the significant cues, the
fast and frugal model showed that GPs used significantly fewer cues and their
policies were less similar. There was no difference in the degree of self-insight
suggested by both models. In sum, both models provided a characterisation of
judgement behaviour consistent with that reported in previous social judgement
theory research.
It might be argued that the lack of significant difference in fit between the two
models in the present example is due to lack of power. The difference in means
we were testing for was not predictable. In keeping with our enthusiasm for
simple rules we have used one here. An alternative test of clarity and meaningfulness of results is Frick’s (1998) stopping rule for conventional statistics tests:
“once a minimum number of subjects is tested, stop with p less than 0.01 or
greater than 0.36, otherwise keep testing” (p.690). We analysed the results of 32
GPs, and the p between overall fit of models was 0.947. So here we stop.
Einhorn (1970) stated that “different models may be equally powerful with
respect to describing the process. It therefore seems that accurately describing the
process is at least necessary although not sufficient for describing the underlying
cognitive process ” (p.222). In the following discussion we provide alternative
criteria for choosing between models. We argue that researchers should seriously
reconsider their use of regression models and test alternatives such as fast and
frugal models. Although both models are psychologically plausible in that they
suggest limited information use, only fast and frugal models are compatible with
evidence of flexible judgement, human categorisation and learning, and are
easier to understand.

<-----Page 16----->FAST AND FRUGAL VS REGRESSION MODELS

Psychological plausibility

21

Researchers have questioned whether regression models are capable of providing
a psychologically valid description of judgement behaviour (Einhorn, 1970,
1971; Einhorn et al., 1979, Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996, Gigerenzer et al.,
1999). Regression models propose that all “ relevant” information is weighted
and integrated. This description of behaviour is considered incompatible with the
fact that the human mind is characterised by limited cognitive processing
capacity (e.g., Kahneman, 1973; Miller, 1956). Hogarth (1980) points out that
selective perception, sequential processing, limited computational ability, and
limited memory have implications for judgement behaviour.
On average, studies using regression models have reported that only three
cues are statistically significant (Brehmer, 1994). In the present example, both
models suggested that GPs were using a small number of cues on average. Note
that “ grey-area” cases, where the decision to prescribe is not immediately
obvious, would have encouraged greater information use rather than simple, onecue decision making.
Although both models are compatible with a limited information processor,
the regression model implies inefficient processing. Each person’s policy is
inflexible because he or she uses the same cues in the same way on every case. In
contrast, the fast and frugal model proposes a flexible and cognitively simple
strategy. Only the necessary cues are used on each case. More complex cases will
elicit greater information search than less complex cases. This degree of
flexibility suggests that the fast and frugal model is psychologically more
plausible than the regression model. It indicates a different type of vicarious
functioning from that encapsulated in a regression model.
Flexibility of an individual is also characterised by his or her ability to select
different ways of using cues given different task demands (Hammond, 1996b;
Payne et al., 1993). Judgement behaviour shifts from compensatory to noncompensatory behaviour under conditions of time pressure (Edland, 1979; Maule
& Svenson, 1993; Rieskamp & Hoffrage, 1999) and stress or information load
(Billings & Marcus, 1983; Chinburapa et al., 1993; Einhorn, 1971; Johnson &
Meyer, 1984; Payne, 1976; Timmermans, 1993). Finally, at least under time
pressure, individuals do not use all of the relevant information (Edland,
1979; Rieskamp & Hoffrage, 1999; Rothstein, 1986; Wright, 1974). The use of
non-compensatory processes under time pressure would suggest that noncompensatory models such as a fast and frugal model are likely to be more
psychologically plausible than compensatory ones (such as a regression model)
under time pressure. The opposite may also be true. Future research should aim to
test the appropriateness of these two models under different task conditions.
We would argue that the Matching Heuristic is a particularly plausible fast and
frugal model. It uses frequencies, a natural form of processing according to
Cosmides and Tooby (1996) and Gigerenzer and Hoffrage (1995). It also

<-----Page 17----->22

involves matching individual cases to a prototype: this is consistent with research
on categorisation (Estes, 1994) and with research on the role of forceful features
in clinical diagnosis (Gale & Marsden, 1985; Grant & Marsden, 1987). Finally, it
exploits cues that may be acquired through direct experience in the domain. The
means by which this is accomplished are likely to depend on the sort of
mechanisms that Nisbett and Ross (1980) and others have identified as
subserving the process of learning about causation and covariation. These
mechanisms are encapsulated in calculation of cue-utilisation validities.

Ease of understanding

Social judgement theorists often have a goal of improving judgement (Hammond
et al., 1975). Judgement policies may be communicated to individuals in order to
aid and train them to make consistent, accurate decisions, or reduce discrepancy
between individuals. The ease with which a model is understood is thus an
important consideration. The regression model has proved a very useful aid.
Studies have demonstrated higher achievement in conditions with cognitive
feedback than in conditions with either no feedback or solely outcome feedback
(Balzer, Doherty, & O’Connor, 1989; Doherty & Balzer, 1988). However, the
regression model may be considered to be an obscure mathematical model that an
individual may have difficulty applying without the aid of a computer.
Regression models are also difficult to apply to a new data set because they are
based on variations in the cues and judgements across the data set. Standardised
weights are usually calculated by researchers and application of these weights to
a new case requires identification of where that case’s cue values fit in the range
of cue values that were used in the original data set on which the model was
formed.
In contrast, fast and frugal models provide a transparent, non-mathematical
description of judgement behaviour. They are simple to apply and can be applied
without knowledge of the properties of the data set on which they were
developed. The properties of the data set are essential for calculation of the fast
and frugal model, but not for its application. For example, if the model says
prescribe if male and the case is male, then we do not need to know the natural
variance of gender in the environment. On the other hand, if a standardised
weight is to be applied (as in a regression model), we need to know this. The
relative usefulness of regression models and fast and frugal models as cognitive
aids needs to be investigated.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Brehmer (1979) argued that the use of the regression model enables researchers
to “test a series of hypotheses about the nature of the judgment process” (p. 199).
It is clear that fast and frugal models would provide a different set of hypotheses,
and in addition would provide hypotheses regarding the process of information

<-----Page 18----->FAST AND FRUGAL VS REGRESSION MODELS

23

search and selection (Gigerenzer & Kurz, in press). These hypotheses should be
tested under different task conditions.
In this review we have argued that a fast and frugal model is capable of describing the judgement side of a lens model: Such models are capable of capturing
probabilistic relations as shown by the procedure for calculating cue-utilisation
validities. The same procedure may be used to calculate ecological validities for
cues on the environment side of the lens model. Computer scientists modelling
the environment have used comparable simple models such as Classification and
Regression Trees for the past 15 years (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone,
1984; Dutton & Conroy, 1996). Thus, we know that fast and frugal strategies are
useful ones in all sorts of environments. However, we do not yet know if the fast
and frugal model that best describes a person’s behaviour is a useful one. Only
Slegers et al. (2000) have modelled both their participants’ judgements and the
(baseball) environment, but they did not compare the two models. A full lens
model analysis is needed. We do not yet know whether individuals can achieve
their goals when being fast and frugal.
When discussing the paramorphic nature of regression models, Doherty and
Brehmer (1997) conclude that “The conception of human judgment emerging
from regression studies of human judgment can be refuted only by evidence that
shows that judgment is something other than a matter of combining pieces of
information that are weighted according to their importance. So far, such
evidence has failed to materialize” (p.547). Obviously, individual researchers
must choose the model that best meets the aims of their research, but we hope that
they will be flexible and avoid “sins of commission ” in the future.
