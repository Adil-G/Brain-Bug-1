Decision Neuroscience
New Directions in Studies of Judgment and Decision Making

ABSTRACT—Investigations

of decision making have historically been undertaken by different disciplines, each using
different techniques and assumptions, and few unifying
efforts have been made. Economists have focused on precise mathematical models of normative decision making,
psychologists have examined how decisions are actually
made based on cognitive constraints, and neuroscientists
have concentrated on the detailed operation of neural
systems in simple choices. In recent years, however,
researchers in these separate ﬁelds have joined forces in
an attempt to better specify the foundations of decision
making. This interdisciplinary effort has begun to use
decision theory to guide the search for the neural bases
of reward value and predictability. Concurrently, these
formal models are beginning to incorporate processes such
as social reward and emotion. The combination of these
diverse theoretical approaches and methodologies is
already yielding significant progress in the construction
of more comprehensive decision-making models.

KEYWORDS—decision making; judgment; choice; neuroscience; economics

The study of decision making has as its goal the understanding of
our fundamental ability to process multiple alternatives and
choose an optimal course of action. A ‘‘good’’ decision is one in
which the best available course of action is chosen in the face of
characteristic uncertainty about the consequences. While some
decisions are straightforward, many are more difﬁcult, either
because the stakes may be high—such as the choice of a mate or
a choice among different potentially life-saving medical treatments—or because there are difﬁcult trade-offs to make between
competing options—such as those usually observed between
quality and price of goods or the respective beneﬁts and side
effects of a drug. To complicate matters, often our decisions are
additionally dependent on how others might respond—for

example, when we are deciding whether to ask someone on a date
or entering a business negotiation.
Disparate approaches to decision making have all made important advances, but there has been relatively little integration
of ﬁndings, with researchers often unaware of empirical
discoveries and theoretical approaches from other areas that
nevertheless have immediate relevance for their own investigations. Economic approaches have primarily focused on
describing idealized, optimal decision behavior, while in recent
times the emergence of psychological models of decision making
have offered more accurate descriptive accounts by taking into
consideration the motivations and constraints of the human
information-processing system. In parallel, neuroscientific
studies have used both single-cell approaches (in which activity
is recorded directly from small groups of neurons) and neuroimaging to examine lower-level perceptual choices in many
animals, but the micro-level decisions typically investigated in
such studies are often difﬁcult to reconcile with the decisions
made by humans in everyday life.
However, a new, interdisciplinary ﬁeld, popularly known as
neuroeconomics, is now striving to better understand decisionmaking behavior by taking into account the cognitive and neural
constraints on this process, as investigated by psychology and
neuroscience, while also utilizing the mathematical decision
models and multiplayer tasks that have emerged from the ﬁeld
of economics. By using the complementary strengths of different
disciplines, the neuroeconomic approach offers a promising
avenue to examine decision making at different levels of analysis
and, eventually, to arrive at a comprehensive account of how
decision making operates.
THE NEURAL BASIS OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS

The ‘‘maximize utility’’ decision rule (Fig. 1) is the core of modern
economic theories of rational behavior and can be summarized in
a succinct equation that represents the evaluation of each course
of action:
Subjective expected utility 5 Sp(xi)u(xi), where p represents
the likelihood of a particular alternative, and u represents the
subjective value of that alternative.

Fig. 1. Choice of two gambles as modeled by formal decision theory. The
canonical subjective expected utility (SEU) model proposes that, to make
a choice, each course of action should be evaluated by multiplying a
subjective valuation of its different possible consequences (in this case,
different dollar rewards) by their probabilities of occurrence, and the
gamble with the highest expected utility should be chosen. Taking gamble
A, in this example, results in a 25% chance to win $100 and a 75% chance
to win $40 (giving a subjective utility value of 55, according to the equation
at the top), whereas gamble B results in a 100% chance of winning $50
(subjective utility value of 50). SEU theory would predict that the decision
maker would choose gamble A, since its subjective utility is higher.

The concept of the expected utility of a decision alternative—the
result of multiplying the alternative’s subjective value by its
probability, is a crucial one, as it enables the decision maker to
compare and contrast options speciﬁed in different formats. For
example, if one is offered the choice between a new television
and a weekend vacation of equal monetary value, how does one
compare the subjective value of the two options? An independent metric for assessing reward value is necessary for a system
that must often choose between rewards delivered in different
modalities.

An extensive literature has demonstrated the limits of subjective expected utility theory (SEUT) as a descriptive account of
decision making (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982); but as a
well-speciﬁed mathematical model and at least a good ﬁrst approximation of decision making, SEUT has offered a useful
starting point for the investigation of decision making’s neural
basis. Of particular interest to psychologists and neuroscientists
are the probability, value, and utility parameters of the SEUT
function. Does the brain make decisions in accordance with the
tenets of SEUT? And, importantly, can brain data be used to
distinguish between competing psychological theories of decision making and choice, providing evidence above and beyond
that obtainable from behavioral studies?

Value and Probability
Several decades of animal research have focused on the neural
bases of reward and punishment and have identiﬁed a number of
systems that are consistently responsive to value. The early focus
of this research was on experienced utility—the reaction to reward
when it is received—but there has since been a gradual shift
toward the investigation of decision utility—the expectation of
consequence at the time the decision is being made. For example,
single-cell recording techniques have discovered responses in
both dopamine neurons (Tobler, Fiorillo, & Schultz, 2005) and
the frontal cortex (Roesch & Olson, 2004) that scale reliably
with reward magnitude, demonstrating neural signatures of the
encoding and processing of reward signals (see Fig. 2).
Findings such as these have informed modern neuroimaging
studies of human reward processing. In particular, the striatum,
an area of the brain rich in dopaminergic neurons, reliably
activates in response to earned monetary reward—for example,
in a study in which participants had to gamble on the uncertain

value of a stimulus (Delgado, Locke, Stenger, & Fiez, 2003)—as
well as in response to primary rewards such as the appetitive
value of food (McClure et al., 2004). It seems likely that
the striatal involvement in reward is related to the midbrain
dopamine systems, which play a critical role in value assessment
by signaling when an error is made in reward prediction, thus
providing a link between theories of reward, theories of learning,
and theories of decision.
In contrast to the large amount of research on reward, relatively little research has been done on judgments of probability.
However, one recent neuroimaging study presented subjects with
cues indicating both the likelihood and value of upcoming monetary rewards and showed that activity in the medial prefrontal
cortex was related to the subjective probability of obtaining the
reward (Knutson, Taylor, Kaufman, Peterson, & Glover, 2005).
This suggests that the probability-estimation process may indeed
be separable from that of reward assessment.

Utility
The tantalizing evidence of potentially distinct systems for the
processing of reward and probability lends support to the SEUT
model as a useful representation of the neural processes at
play in decision making, as this model also implies separable
processes for reward and probability measures. Studies have
now begun to investigate the neural signatures of the expectedutility signal itself.
Experimental work with animals has revealed brain areas that
appear to directly encode the utility of a stimulus. In one study,
monkeys were placed in front of a computer screen and presented
with two colored squares, each of which represented a different
reward schedule of juice. Electrode recordings demonstrated that
specific neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) were representing the utility signal for each target and that the monkey’s
eye-movements on each trial were in accordance with this utility
measure, suggesting a strong relationship between neural metrics
of utility and decision behavior (Sugrue, Corrado, & Newsome,
2004). Also, these neurons seem sensitive to direct manipulations
of utility, exhibiting combined effects of value and probability as
predicted by the SEUT model (Platt & Glimcher, 1999).
The LIP has been well characterized as a motor-preparation
area, and therefore it seems probable that the utility measure is
computed elsewhere in the brain and shunted downstream to LIP
for action selection, and studies in both humans and animals are
now testing for brain activity that scales directly with decisionrelated expected utility. In a functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) experiment, Knutson et al. (2005) manipulated
both reward magnitude and probability and found that activation
in striatal reward areas indeed correlates with expected utility,
showing that utility-like signals can be found outside motorpreparation areas like LIP. Additionally, a particularly interesting
recent study (Padoa-Schioppa & Assad, 2006) found that neurons
in the monkey orbitofrontal cortex encode the subjective value of

Volume 16—Number 3

various decision alternatives (in this case, juice vs. water), independent of any action required to select between them, thus
providing evidence for a neural decision-making mechanism not
tied to motor response and again suggestive that the classical
utility approach may be a useful model of how choice alternatives
are represented by neural encoding mechanisms.
What unites all of the aforementioned studies is the use of
classical, formal economic models to examine the underlying
psychological and neural basis of decision making; the results of
these studies suggest that the various decision processes implied
by the classical model (probability estimation, reward and loss
valuation, utility calculation) may indeed be instantiated in the
brain. This is important, as it provides some empirical support for
these formal models of decision making and offers a very useful
framework for examining the neural basis of decisions and choices.
Neural and Theoretical Models
The real beneﬁt, and potential transformative advantage, of the
neuroeconomic approach is in the combination of methods: using
the tools of neuroscience to empirically examine the predictions of
formal economic models. To date, research into the neural basis
of utility has largely been a brain-mapping endeavor—that is,
identifying the brain areas that may underlie the computations of
probability, reward, and expected utility, respectively. This enterprise represents a not inconsiderable achievement and is a
necessary precursor to work that will use these neural ﬁndings to
build more accurate decision models. However, even at this early
stage, the presence of distinct neural areas that appear to correspond to the weighting and summing processes underlying the
classical approach can help in distinguishing between alternative
models of decision making. For example, recent research has
proposed that choices are often made via simple rules of thumb,
suggesting an alternative model to the classical approach
(Brandstatter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006). Therefore, demonstrating that brain areas do indeed weight and sum probabilities
and values is an important piece of evidence that the family of
utility-theory models may well be an accurate representation of
how the brain decides between alternatives.
Further, neuroimaging work on reward processing has
demonstrated neural activity that conforms to predictions of
psychological decision theories such as prospect theory
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). One important principle of this
theory is that people evaluate the outcome of decisions based
on a ﬂexible reference point; this would predict that the neural
systems responsible for utility assessment should be responsive
to relative gains and losses rather than to absolute levels. Recent
studies using both fMRI (Breiter, Aharon, Kahneman, Dale,
& Shizgal, 2001) and electroencephalogram (Holroyd, Larsen,
& Cohen, 2004) have provided support for this prediction: Both
experiments demonstrated that neural signatures of reward are
determined by the value of the outcome relative to the range of
possible outcomes rather than by the objective value of the
outcome itself.

NEURAL BASIS OF SOCIAL EXCHANGE

Much of the research described in the previous section, characteristic of a common approach utilized by psychology and neuroscience, examines decision tasks with clearly deﬁned probabilities
and outcomes—for example, choosing between monetary gambles. However, another class of decisions has been investigated by
economics—decisions that, although beguilingly simple, require
complex reasoning about the motivations and strategies employed
by other players. Tasks involving such decisions offer a useful
window into more complex forms of decision making that may
better approximate many of the choices we make in real life.
In a similar fashion to the framework provided by utility theory
for studying individual decisions, game theory offers wellspeciﬁed models for the investigation of social exchange.
However, much of the decision behavior actually observed in
social-exchange tasks deviates, often quite substantially, from
the predictions of the standard game-theoretic model, suggesting that psychological and neuroscientific approaches may help
our understanding of these decisions and judgments. Recent
research has combined these tasks with neuroimaging in an
effort to gain a more detailed picture of social decision making.
One strand of neuroimaging research has made an important
contribution by showing that social exchange can act directly
on the brain’s reward system, providing further evidence for
a ﬂexible reward system and a common metric that can be used
to compare across reward types. For example, Rilling, Sanfey,
Aronson, Nystrom, and Cohen (2004) have shown that the
striatum, which (as described previously) is active for basic
rewards, appears to also encode more abstract rewards such as
the positive feeling garnered by mutual cooperation in a social
decision-making task known as the Prisoner’s Dilemma.
Similarly, de Quervain et al. (2004) used positron-emission
tomography imaging to examine punishment of transgressing
social norms in an economic-exchange game and identiﬁed
reward-related brain areas associated with punishment of
nonreciprocators. Other ﬁndings have been reported in a relation to exhibitions of trust in an investment game (King-Casas
et al., 2005): A neural signal corresponding to the ‘‘intention to
increase trust’’ was isolated, showing that abstract rewards like
trust are encoded in reward-related areas.
In a related vein, a neuroimaging study (Sanfey et al., 2003)
examined behavior in a classic economic task, the Ultimatum
Game, in which two players share a sum of money between them.
This game demonstrates that people will often sacriﬁce monetary
reward in order to punish a player who treats them unfairly. The
researchers found a brain area—the anterior insula—that
exhibited greater activation as the unfairness of the offer
increased. Further, this area was more active when playing with
another human than with a computer partner, and, importantly,
the activation of this area in combination with others reliably
predicted the player’s decision whether to cooperate or not. The
anterior insula is typically activated when people are confronted

154

with aversive physical stimuli, suggesting that more basic
sensory areas can be recruited for higher-level decisions.
Additionally, many of the imaging studies of social exchange
have demonstrated the large inﬂuence of automatic processes,
such as emotions, on these types of decisions. In contrast to the
standard economic model, which presupposes the operation of a
single rational information processor, current research is examining how the twin systems of automatic and controlled processing
may cooperate—and sometimes compete—in decision making.
The degree to which these subsystems are biologically distinct is
an area of hot debate, but data from neuroimaging studies can not
only provide a window onto the existence and location of different
subsystems but, in addition, potentially facilitate quantitative
estimation of the degree of involvement of these systems to better
inform utility parameters in formal models.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The preceding sections review some general ways in which
decision neuroscience can make important contributions to the
understanding of decision making. These ﬁndings provide some
traction for measuring physical mechanisms responsible for
individual and social decision making and offer the promise of
identifying and precisely characterizing both the mechanisms
and the factors that inﬂuence how they engage and interact.
As with any new approach, there are challenges to address.
The component disciplines operate at different levels of analysis
and have different theoretical assumptions. More practically,
there are important differences in methodology, in particular
with regard to the use of deception and monetary incentives.
However, at worst, data generated by such a cross-disciplinary
approach will be valuable in providing additional constraints,
based on our growing knowledge of neural functioning, on any
theory that seeks to accurately model decision making; and at
best, such data will allow discrimination and modeling of processes that may be difﬁcult to separate at the behavioral level.
The neuroeconomic approach will continue to depend on the
diverse strengths of its contributing disciplines and the willingness of its proponents to continue collaborating and communicating. But given the energetic research and promising results
currently emerging, it seems likely that the ﬁeld has real potential
for making important contributions to our understanding of
decision making, above and beyond what will continue to be
learned from work within each discipline independently.
