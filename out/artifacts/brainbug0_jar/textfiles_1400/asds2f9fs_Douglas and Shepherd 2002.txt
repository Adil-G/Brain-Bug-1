Exploring investor readiness: assessments by
entrepreneurs and investors in Australia
EVAN J. DOUGLAS and DEAN SHEPHERD
(Final version accepted 12 March 2002)
Entrepreneurs often submit crude business plans to potential investors and are frequently
disappointed when the investor decides that the new venture is not yet ‘investment ready’.
This paper examines the nature of investor readiness and the differing perceptions of
investor readiness by entrepreneurs relative to venture capitalists in Australia. It is found
that when the assessments of each investor readiness dimension are combined they are
related to the venture capitalists’ intuitive (gut) assessments; that new ventures are
perceived to be more marketing and management ready than technology ready; and
investors and entrepreneurs differ in their perception of readiness (technology, market,
management and overall).

Keywords: investor readiness; venture capital; new venture risk; business plans

Introduction
To start and grow a business requires financial capital. While this may be
funded in the early stages by the founder, family and friends, most
businesses will require additional equity funding from external investors.
This capital appears to have a positive impact on growth (Cooper et al.
1994) and provide a buffer against unforeseen difficulties (Castrogiovani
1996, Venkatraman and Van de Ven 1998). Investors may provide more
than just the financial capital, e.g. access to the investors’ extensive network
of buyers, suppliers, and possible joint venture partners (see Timmons and
Bygrave 1986, Sapienza 1992, Sapienza et al. 1996 for examples of nonfinancial benefits).
While it is known that it is important for an entrepreneur to be able to
attract equity investors, less is known about how an entrepreneur should
prepare his/her venture to make it more attractive to venture capitalists.
This is particularly the case in Australia where the venture capital industry
is relatively new and there is less general knowledge about raising venture
capital among the entrepreneurial community. While the Australian
venture capital industry is relatively new it has grown rapidly since the
early 1990s and represents an important source of equity capital for

Australian entrepreneurs. Therefore, there is a need to gain a deeper
understanding of how venture capitalists assess the investor readiness of
proposed new ventures such that Australian entrepreneurs are better
positioned to attract equity investment.
Attracting equity investors requires an accurate understanding of what
the investor is looking for and how the venture will be perceived along
those dimensions. For example, the expression ‘fools rush in where angels
fear to tread’ might have been coined for the new-venture funding
situation, where business angels and venture capitalists decline to invest in
new ventures despite the passionate assertions of the entrepreneurs
involved. Venture capitalists frequently note that they see many business
plans that are not yet ‘investor ready’ because entrepreneurs fail to
recognize risks that seem likely to cause the new venture to fail. It would
seem that entrepreneurs wear ‘rose-coloured glasses’ that put an optimistic
glow on the project and filter out the risks they do not want to see (Busenitz
and Barney 1997). But by so doing they waste the time, effort and emotion
of both themselves and of the investors they pursue.
If ‘investor readiness’ and the sources of risk for new ventures can be
more clearly identified, entrepreneurs will write better business plans and
the new venture funding process will be facilitated. Moreover, with better
information about risks facing the new venture, both the entrepreneur and
the investor can better predict the probability of the business surviving and
enjoying sustainable competitive advantages. Entrepreneurs might recognize that some risks are unacceptably large and thus see that the project is
not yet ready for consideration by investors. Entrepreneurs seeking to
‘bootstrap’ their way into a new business venture should be just as diligent
as the venture capitalists. They must critically evaluate the risks, since it is
their money and hard work that is at stake if the new venture fails to launch
and grow successfully.
The above discussion leads to the following research questions: Can
assessments along the dimensions of investor readiness help explain the
intuitive (gut) choices made by investors? On which dimensions of investor
readiness are new ventures more advanced? How do investors and
entrepreneurs differ in their perceptions of investor readiness? These
research questions are investigated using a sample of Australian entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.
The paper proceeds as follows. First, it looks at why investors might
reject a funding proposal from an entrepreneur. Second, new venture risks
are explored and three dimensions of investor readiness are proposed:
technological, market and management. The relative importance of these
dimensions are hypothesized, how investors and entrepreneurs differ in
their perceptions of a new venture’s readiness, and whether combining
assessments of each dimension provides insight into an investor’s intuitive
assessment policy. Third, the research method is detailed. Specifically, the
Australian context in which the study takes place is discussed and the
methods of analysis are detailed, namely, the use of non-parametric tests,
which are an appropriate and under-utilized method for investigating
investors’ assessment policies (Sandberg 1986). Finally, the results and
their implications for scholars and practitioners are discussed.

Rejection of business plan by investor
It is noted that an investor may decline to invest for a variety of reasons that
are either cost or risk based. Apart from the financial investment in the new
venture that is being sought by the entrepreneur, the investor may incur
several other costs that effectively increase the total cost of his/her
investment and thus reduce the expected return on the investment that is
contemplated. These costs include those related to due diligence,
monitoring, psychic, opportunity and excessive risk.
Due diligence costs
Investors may decline to invest and cite their unfamiliarity with the
industry or market in question and/or their preference for investment in
particular industries and markets in which they do have substantial
accumulated knowledge and experience (Tybjee and Bruno 1984, Shepherd
and Douglas 1999). In effect they are economizing on due diligence costs,
or their costs of reducing risks to an acceptable level. In familiar industries
they may already know most of the information they would need to find out
before making their decision, and thus be able to not only make the decision
more cheaply in terms of cost and time, but also more quickly in a
competitive environment where the first investor to accept gets the prize
(whatever it is worth).
Monitoring costs
Investors may decline to invest on the basis of the new venture not being
geographically proximate to them (Fiet 1995, Cable and Shane 1997). In
this case the investor may expect monitoring costs to be excessive due to the
geographic distance between the new venture and the investor’s own base
of operations. Investors typically prefer projects that are geographically
convenient because they can economically ‘drop in while in the
neighbourhood’ to oversee the attainment of milestones, verify progress,
and see first-hand how their money is being spent. This is particularly the
case for business angels.
Psychic costs
Psychic costs may be associated with poor personality fit between the
entrepreneur (or top management team) and the investor, and might result
from personality clashes, arguments, or prejudices held by either party.
Considering the personality and prejudices held by either or both parties,
the investor may feel that the relationship he/she would have with the
entrepreneur or other members of the top management team would not be a
pleasant one and would thus impose psychic costs. These would raise the
expected total cost of investment in the new venture to a level that could

<-----Page 3----->222

EVAN J. DOUGLAS AND DEAN SHEPHERD

cause expected returns to fall below an acceptable level. (For a discussion of
social capital see Sapienza and Korsgard 1996 and Shepherd and
Zacharakis 2001).
Opportunity costs
The entrepreneur’s request for funding necessarily competes with other
such requests, and some of these might be less risky and more
remunerative, at least in prospect. Venture capitalists typically decline to
invest in ‘safe hits’ in favour of potential ‘home runs’. Although finding the
present project within his/her risk tolerance, the investor may feel that it is
not remunerative enough to compensate for the other investments in the
investor’s portfolio that may ‘strike out’.
Costs of excessive risk
Whether or not risk is excessive must be seen through the eyes of the
investor. Business angels and venture capitalists are typically not strongly
risk averse, but they are likely to react adversely to any risk that should have
been removed before the venture is presented to them. The entrepreneur
can remove this excessive risk from the new venture by understanding
where it comes from and what it takes to remove it.
Considering the above, investor readiness is defined as the ability to
attract significant external investor funding from business angels and/or
venture capital funds.1 A new venture will be investor ready when at least
one investor is willing to invest, and therefore foresees sufficient return on
investment, feels that the risk is at tolerably low levels, and does not expect
to incur excessive monitoring, due diligence, psychic or opportunity costs
in addition to the cost of purchasing equity in the new venture. In theory,
there would be a line of investors ranging from the most-willing to the
least-willing, and who exhibit progressively increasing degrees of risk
aversion, and/or progressively more adverse geographic, industry and/or
personal preferences. The entrepreneur’s task, of course, is to identify the
investors at the front of this line, since these will be most likely to find the
new venture to be investor ready.
The sources of new venture risk
Recently, Shepherd et al. (2000) argue that ignorance is a major source of
new venture risk. They argue that, other things being equal, the mortality
rate of new ventures is higher than for established ventures because of the
ignorance of three major groups, namely consumers, producers and
managers. Ignorance means lack of knowledge, of course, and the ignorance
of these stakeholders may contribute significantly to the financial risk of the
new venture. Financial failure of the firm is more likely if the revenue
stream of the new firms is more uncertain in prospect due to the potential

<-----Page 4----->EXPLORING INVESTOR REA DINESS

223

consumer’s lack of knowledge about the new firm’s existence, its products
or services, the benefits offered by the new products or services, the price
and quality of those products and services, and so on. Similarly, financial
failure is more likely if the technology of production is not well understood
and thus the production process is prone to cost blowouts and/or liability
claims from customers. Finally, management’s lack of knowledge concerning the best ways (for a new firm potentially starting in a new industry and
market), to manage production, marketing, human resources and finances,
may result in costly mistakes and cost overruns that precipitate the new
venture’s mortality.
New venture mortality risk declines over time as information is
discovered by and flows to the consumer, producer, and managers of the
new venture. Shepherd et al. (2000) distinguished between passive
information capture (e.g. learning by doing, word-of-mouth transmission,
learning by observation, and so on) and active risk reduction strategies
(such as marketing activities, in-house training programmes, and recruiting
qualified and experience technologists and managers). Thus ignorance can
be actively reduced by specific strategies and tactics adopted. This can take
place prior to approaching an investor, and thus reduce mortality risk to a
level that might be found tolerable by the investor. In addition, riskreducing strategies may be clearly articulated in the business plan and thus
provide comfort to the investor that the risks are indeed recognised and will
be managed effectively by a competent top management team.
Investor readiness decomposed
It is proposed that the aspects of investor readiness can be decomposed into
three main sub-areas of readiness, namely technology readiness, market
readiness and management readiness, based on the degree to which
producer, consumer and manager ignorance (respectively) prevail at the
time the entrepreneur approaches the investor. Each element of investor
readiness is considered in turn.
Technology readiness
A new venture may be categorized as increasingly technology ready if its
technology actually works, if prototypes have been built and successfully
tested for durability and reliability, and if the new product or service can be
mass-produced at a unit cost that allows sufficient profit at the envisioned
price level. Under ‘technology’, investors will consider the intellectual
property and/or trade secrets embodied in the new product and/or service,
and will be concerned that the technology is proprietary to the firm and has
adequate intellectual property protection.
If a new venture’s technology has not yet been fully worked through,
such that finer details still need to be worked out, if a prototype has not yet
been built, if the prototype has not yet been tested under beta-site
conditions, if problems with the product or service’s durability or

<-----Page 5----->224

EVAN J. DOUGLAS AND DEAN SHEPHERD

reliability have not yet been solved, if the prototype cannot easily be
modified for mass production at sufficiently low cost per unit, or if the
technology is not proprietary, then the new venture is not likely to be
technology ready, and thus less investor ready. By investing now the
investor would assume the risk that these things are not achieved quickly
and economically. Depending on the risk tolerance of the investor, he/she
may decide to plunge in and take the additional risk (for a larger equity
share), or to wait and see and therefore decline to invest at the current time.
Market readiness
A new venture is market ready if it has been tested in concept and in
prototype form against the needs and preferences of the target customer,
and found to be in substantial demand by the target market at the proposed
price level. The best evidence of this, of course, is a track record of sales of
early production units, but favourable results from properly conducted
market surveys, consumer clinics, and test market experiments will reduce
the risk associated with the market acceptability of the new product or
service.
Conversely, if there is doubt whether the market will accept the new
product or service, or whether they will switch to the new firm from their
previous supplier, or whether they will pay the asking price, and so on, then
there is risk associated with the investment that might have been removed
by the conduct of appropriate market research. Thus the investor might
consider the market risk to be excessive, and hence the new venture is not
yet investment ready (at least from his/her viewpoint).
Management readiness
A new venture is not management ready if it does not have in place a top
management team (TMT) with the appropriate management acumen, prior
experience in the same or related industries and markets, prior start-up
experience, and strong commitment to the launch and growth of the new
venture. The TMT must collectively have experience and qualifications
across the range of business and technology areas that are needed by this
particular new venture—there should be no ‘holes’ in the management
team as perceived by the investor.
Many an entrepreneur or new venture management team has felt that it
is indeed ‘management ready’ but cannot gain funding due to the
perception by investors that the management team is not strong enough
to handle the tasks ahead (or the investor’s money). In some cases the
investor will have reservations about the management and will only agree to
invest if an unfilled position is filled appropriately or if the investor can
install his/her own nominee into the CEO or other management role.
It is noted that there would be flows of information between the three
dimensions of investor readiness, such as between prototype development
and consumer testing, and between producer learning and management

<-----Page 6----->EXPLORING INVESTOR REA DINESS

225

learning, with learning in one dimension serving to inform parties in the
other dimensions as well.
Thus, a necessary condition for investor readiness is the concurrent
attainment of technology readiness, market readiness, and management
readiness from the viewpoint of the target investor. It is noted that investor
readiness in these three dimensions is not a sufficient condition for new
venture funding because of the additional cost considerations mentioned
earlier. The entrepreneur’s failure to gain external funding may be due to
the investor’s perception that the firm is excessively risky in one or more of
these areas. Entrepreneurs must communicate to investors that they
possess information that reduces ignorance in each of these dimensions and
thus have reduced the risk of the new venture to tolerably low levels.
Finally, it is contended that the investor’s overall valuation of the new
venture opportunity is effectively captured and may be predicted by his/her
perception of its investor readiness. Thus, it is expected that in evaluating
several business plans, the investor’s scores for investor readiness across the
several business plans will rank the plans in the same order that he/she
would rank them subjectively without specifically considering the
particular elements of investor readiness. If so, the new venture judged
to be the most investor ready would be the one the investor would be most
likely to actually invest in, subject to further due diligence investigation and
consideration of the cost issues mentioned in the introduction:
H1: The ranking of potential new ventures (by investors) according to their perceived
investment readiness is positively related with their overall intuitive ranking.

It is argued that there are similarities across new ventures in terms of their
‘readiness’ due, in part, to the presence of ‘inventor’s myopia’. Inventor’s
myopia is the belief that if a better mousetrap can be built in a hut in the
forest, customers will beat a path to our door. While this focus on product
technology is criticized because of the lack of attention on other factors
such as the market and management, it is argued that many entrepreneurs
indeed exhibit this myopia. It is argued that much of an entrepreneur’s
attention is focused on the technology and the new venture will therefore be
more investor ready in terms of its technology than it will be for its market
and management. While it may be appropriate to focus on the technology
before market and management, the new venture must be ready on all
dimensions to be most attractive to investors. On this basis our second
hypothesis is established:
H2: New ventures are typically perceived by investors to be more technology ready than they are
marketing and management ready.

Since investors are usually more experienced in business and wealth
accumulation than novice entrepreneurs, it is expected that investors will
possess relevant information not possessed by the entrepreneur. Thus, the
entrepreneur may consider him/herself ‘investor ready’ out of ignorance of
issues that the investor considers highly pertinent. This information
asymmetry will result in investors scoring a new venture lower on investor

<-----Page 7----->226

EVAN J. DOUGLAS AND DEAN SHEPHERD

readiness than the entrepreneur would score his/her venture. It is noted
that potential investors are likely to disagree on investor readiness due to
their potentially differing knowledge bases and degrees of risk aversion.
Second, it may be human nature to over-estimate one’s own capabilities
when faced with a challenge, especially when the nature of the challenge is
uncertain. For example, Busenitz and Barney (1997) found that entrepreneurs are more prone to biases, including overconfidence, than managers in
large organizations. While this optimistic overconfidence may be important
in starting a business, it may hinder an entrepreneur’s ability to
communicate the new venture’s readiness to investors:
H3: Investors will perceive a potential new venture to have less: (a) technology readiness; (b)
market readiness; (c) management readiness; and (d) overall investor readiness, than will the
entrepreneur-manager of that new venture.

Research method
Sample
The sample of new ventures was the 16 teams of MBA students competing
in the MOOT CORP Australia business plan competition held in late
March 2001. These can reasonably be regarded as legitimate entrepreneurs
seeking funding for their proposed new venture, since the prizes in cash
and kind exceeded AUD$150 000 (approximately $80 000 USD) from
major sponsors, and most sponsors had attached the condition that the
prizes were claimable only by bona fide new ventures actually planning to
launch their business. This gives considerable confidence that the business
plans and their start-up intentions were real. The response rate to the
survey was 81% (13 teams).
The competition was conducted in four heats of four teams each, with
the winners of each heat going into the final round to compete for the
overall prizes and the trip to the global final in Austin, Texas. Each heat
had four to six judges, comprising venture capitalists, business angels,
successful entrepreneurs, managers of venture capital funds, and industry
professionals such as accountants, lawyers and business consultants. These
judges can each be regarded as investors or reasonable proxies for investors,
given that they consider business plans and advise potential entrepreneurs
on a regular basis.
The judges were asked to answer the same questions in respect of each
of the four teams they judged, plus additional questions relating to whether
they might not invest for one the other (cost) reasons hypothesized above.
Five judges (20%) responded, including at least one judge from three of the
heats but unfortunately none from the fourth heat or the final round.
Survey
A questionnaire was developed to capture the respondents’ perception of
the degree of readiness in each of the three areas of investor readiness.

<-----Page 8----->EXPLORING INVESTOR REA DINESS

227

Twenty-five questions were developed, with each question relating to an
aspect of one of the readiness dimensions. Likert responses to each
question were graduated from (1) perception as ‘not-at-all ready’ to (5)
perception as ‘highly ready’ with an alternate option for ‘do not know, or I
am not sure’.
The questionnaire was administered to both the CEO of the new
venture seeking venture capital, and to one or more investors who had
read the business plan of the new venture and had subsequently listened
to the management team’s 20-minute presentation followed by a 20minute question and answer session. The questionnaire contained seven
questions relating to technology readiness and nine questions relating to
each of the other two dimensions of investor readiness, and is shown in
the appendix A.
Australian venture capital industry
To better interpret this study’s findings it is useful to provide a more
detailed description of its context—the Australian venture capital industry
in 2001. Based on the Australian Venture Capital Guide (Bivell 2001), this
industry is made up of approximately 135 venture capital firms. These
venture capital firms are relatively young (mean age of six years, standard
deviation of 4.77) and small (mean number of venture capitalists is 5.87,
standard deviation of 4.88).
The Australian venture capital industry has total available capital of
AUD$5.1 billion. The mean invested capital by a venture capital firm is
AUD$50.94 million (standard deviation of 131.6), which is invested in only
7.63 portfolio companies (standard deviation of 9.37). The mean number of
divested portfolio companies in 2000 was 2.93 (standard deviation of 7.50).
Therefore Australian venture capitalists do not appear to have, on average,
as much experience in investing and harvesting portfolio companies when
compared to their US counterparts. The same would likely apply to
Australian entrepreneurs: they are relatively inexperienced in the venture
capital process.
Analysis
Sandberg (1986) proposed that non-parametric statistics is a useful
approach to investigate new ventures. This represents a medium-grained
approach when compared to parametric statistics on large samples on the
one hand and cases studies with a samples size of one or two on the other
(Harrigan 1983). Specifically, hypothesis 1 requires a measure of
correlation between the aggregated score of investor readiness and the
investor’s actual decision. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was
chosen to test this hypothesis because it does not force rank those new
ventures that were tied for a placing. The Mann-Whitney U test is used to
test for differences in central tendency, which is necessary to test
hypotheses two and three.

<-----Page 9----->228

Results
A summary of the data is shown as table 1. For each of the responding
teams in three of the four heats, the average score (where 1 is least ready
and 5 is most ready) is shown in each of the three readiness dimensions, as
self-rated by the entrepreneur and as rated by the investor (or investors on
average) who also responded. The teams are grouped in the their heats and
ranked according to the overall finish in the heat as determined by the
entire judging panel for each heat.
As discussed above a Spearman rank correlation is used to test
hypothesis 1, namely, whether the ranking of new ventures (by investors)
according to their perceived investment readiness is positively related with
their overall ranking of the same new ventures made intuitively by the
investor without explicitly considering the various elements of investor
readiness. It is found that the assessment of investor readiness was
significantly related to the ranking of the new ventures (Spearman’s rho
correlation coefficient=0.901; p50.01) providing support for hypothesis 1.
For hypothesis 2, the Mann-Whitney test was used to test whether new
ventures are perceived to be more technology ready than marketing and
management ready. For this analysis the perceptions of investors and
entrepreneurs were combined. It is found that technology readiness has a
mean rank of 20.5 while market and management have a mean rank of 35.5.
These differences are significant (Mann-Whitney U=200; significance
level=0.002). Therefore, the hypothesis that new ventures are perceived to
be more technology ready than marketing and management ready (H2) was
not supported, in fact the findings suggest that the new ventures were more
marketing and management ready than technology ready.
For hypothesis 3 the Mann-Whitney U test was also used. The results
are reported in table 2 and indicate that there are significant differences
between investors and entrepreneurs in their perceptions of investor
readiness. Specifically, investors perceived the new venture to have less
technology readiness (Mann-Whitney U=22; significance level 50.05),
market readiness (Mann-Whitney U=14.5; significance level 50.01),
management readiness (Mann-Whitney U=19; significance level50.05),

and overall investor readiness (Mann-Whitney U=14.5; significance
level50.01), than did the entrepreneur-manager of that new venture. These
findings provide support for hypotheses 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, respectively.
It can be inferred from these findings that when the assessments of each
investor readiness dimension are combined they are highly correlated with
the venture capitalists’ intuitive (gut) assessments; that new ventures are
perceived to be more marketing and management ready than technology
ready; and investors and entrepreneurs differ in their perception of
readiness (technology, market, management, and overall).
Discussion
While a number of studies have asked venture capitalists what criteria they
use to assess ventures, few studies have used those criteria to investigate
whether they do significantly predict VCs’ decisions. This is of concern
because it appears that VCs have only limited insight into the decision
policies they actually do use (Zacharakis and Meyer 1998). VCs use intuition
(Kahn 1997), which by definition means that it is difficult to articulate one’s
decision process. It is possible to infer venture capitalists’ decision policies
by understanding their investment history. However, as detailed above, the
Australian venture capital industry has had a relatively short life.
This study found that venture capitalists’ individual assessments of
investor readiness in the technology, market and management dimensions
can be aggregated and used to significantly explain investors’ ranking of
new ventures in terms of investment attractiveness. Therefore, a decision
model was used from assessments of investor readiness to significantly
predict investors’ actual ranking of new ventures. Such a finding is an
important step towards better preparing entrepreneurs to obtain funding
by reducing investor uncertainty.
Future research is required to further explore the predictive ability of
an ‘investor readiness’ model. First, while non-parametric tests provide
tests of significance it is not possible to determine the strength of the
relationship. Therefore, there are opportunities to use larger samples and
parametric tests to investigate the amount of explained variance and also
the relative importance of criteria. For example, an equal weighting method
of aggregating the three investor readiness criteria was used. While an equal

<-----Page 11----->230

EVAN J. DOUGLAS AND DEAN SHEPHERD

weighting approach is believed to be a good approximation of actual
decision making, the calculation of decision weights from parametric
testing will likely improve predictive ability. Second, while our operationalizations of technology, market and management readiness have face
validity, further research into the validity of scales for the investor
readiness constructs using larger sample sizes is required, e.g. measures of
Chronbach’s alphas. Such scale research might benefit from more finegrained case study research that ‘finds’ examples and appropriate
terminology to be used in item construction. Third, hopefully more
research will investigate the predictive ability of models developed.
The second interesting finding in this paper is that new ventures appear
to be more investor ready in terms of their marketing and management than
in terms of their technology. It appears that these new ventures reflect a
focus opposite to that proposed by the ‘investors myopia’ concept. These
new venture teams primarily consisted of business school students (MBAs).
These students appear to be better trained in marketing and managing a
new venture than they are in advancing the technology towards
commercialization. This suggests that these teams may need to include
an engineer well trained in the development of technologies and/or business
schools in general, and entrepreneurship courses specifically, might need to
have a greater focus on the management of technology. It may be that
entrepreneurs are using a staged approach to preparing their business for
investors with management and marketing first and then technology. It is
speculated that a staged progression may be less effective for preparing a
new venture for investors than a more iterative process where development
in one dimension is highly inter-related with the other dimensions. Again,
follow-up research would make a substantial contribution to the VC and
entrepreneurship literatures.
Our final finding is that entrepreneurs and investors have a different
perception of the new venture’s readiness for investment. When it comes to
gaining investor support it is important for the entrepreneur to step back
from the venture (and his/her optimistic outlook) and view the new venture
through the eyes of an investor. At a minimum this should help the chances
of the new venture obtaining the necessary cash infusion. But it is also
likely that this investor perspective will yield insights into ways of
improving the profitability and/or survival chances of the venture.
The rating of the business plans ‘as a document that communicates the
excitement and viability of the new venture’ was perhaps predictable, with
all entrepreneurs rating their business plan higher than did the judge, and
with the heat winners scoring the higher ratings from the judges and also
the smallest differences in perception of business plan quality.
Generalizability
Are these results generalizable to venture capitalists and entrepreneurs
from countries other than Australia? A number of venture capitalists
proposed that Australian venture capital firms are modelled on their US
counterparts with many venture capitalists educated by US universities.

Furthermore, since deregulation of the Australian financial markets a
number of multinational venture capital firms have entered the Australian
venture capital industry. This globalization might suggest that the results
of this study are generalizable to venture capitalists in other countries, such
as the US and UK.
However, discussions with participants also revealed that the Australian
venture capital industry is in its growth stage and less mature than the US
industry. Therefore, the ability to generalize this study’s results to venture
capitalists in the US and the UK may be questionable. Maybe the results
are more generalizable to venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in countries
where the venture capital industry is in the same stage of development. If
differences exist, cross-national research may make an important contribution to our knowledge about venture capitalists’ decision making—the
majority of venture capital research has been conducted in the US and to a
lesser extent the UK. A natural extension of this study is to replicate it in
the US. In sum, care must be taken in generalizing the results of this study
beyond Australian venture capitalists.
Conclusions
This exploratory study contributes to the research literature since little
systematic attempt has yet been made to analyse the reasons for rejection of
new venture funding, particularly in Australia. This study throws light on
the importance of differing perceptions of investor readiness and what
needs to be taught to address this problem. Recognition that they are not
yet investor ready will save entrepreneurs substantial time, effort and
money. Self-evaluation of readiness across pertinent dimensions might be
incorporated into an ‘application protocol’ supplied by VCs to allow them
to better screen out business plans that they would have rejected anyway.
Ranking new ventures according to the somewhat more objective
dimensions of investor readiness appears to accurately predict investor
ranking of the same firms that would be obtained using the more-subjective
criteria that investors typically use. Thus a practical implication of this
paper is a checklist of the components of investor readiness that will allow
entrepreneurs to better evaluate their new venture’s investor readiness and
to prepare better business plans. Thus the 25-point questionnaire might be
usefully employed as a checklist by firms seeking venture capital to ensure
that they have considered all the issues. Knowledge that investors usually
view readiness more stringently might also induce entrepreneurs to
consider more carefully their self-perception of readiness and to build
more evidence for their case before confronting investors with their
business plans and over-confident assertions.
Conversely, completion of a questionnaire along these lines by the
investor would provide the entrepreneur with a substantially greater
volume and detail of feedback information to take away and ponder before
approaching the next investor, than would the typically short verbal
debriefing or the curt message that the investor is not interested in
proceeding with further discussion.

By ensuring that new ventures are ‘investor ready’ the Australian
business-investor community can avoid the waste of substantial money and
human effort currently expended. It is preferable to conserve the funds and
human energy for application to potential new ventures that have been
adequately screened for their commercial viability.
Note
1. Note that seed funding from the founder, family, and friends is typically not subject to the stringent
‘due diligence’ applied by external investors. Due diligence is the process of confirming claims made
by the entrepreneur and independently evaluating the investment opportunity that investors
undertake before making a firm commitment to fund the new venture.
