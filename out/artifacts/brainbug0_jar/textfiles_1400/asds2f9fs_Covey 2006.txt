<-----Page 0----->THE 13 BEHAVIORS OF A HIGH TRUST LEADER
Stephen M. R. Covey
What separates the great leaders from the good ones? What makes a manager a manager of choice by
her reports, peers, and boss? What makes an individual credible with customers, suppliers, distributors,
investors, and other stakeholders? While there are many dimensions to these questions, there is one
common thread throughout: being an individual who can be trusted.
Perhaps a more important question than, "Who do you trust?" is the far more personal question of,
"Who trusts you?" There are some organizations who ask all their employees directly the following
simple, key question in formal 360º feedback processes:
"Do you trust your boss?"
These companies have learned that the answer to this question is more predictive of team and
organizational success than perhaps any other question they might ask.
A High Trust Leader is an individual who has unquestionably strong personal credibility, has the
ability to create and grow trust with others interpersonally, and who is then able to extend that trust
organizationally.
High Trust Leaders are managers of choice who understand the impact trust always plays on two key
outcomes—speed and cost—and how low or high trust either extracts a tax or produces a dividend on
every activity and dimension within a relationship, team, or organization.
High Trust Leaders have learned how to interact with others in ways that increase trust levels while
avoiding the pitfalls that deplete trust. While there are numerous actions and behaviors that affect trust
accounts, we have identified the 13 key behaviors that High Trust Leaders have in common (the first five
behaviors are primarily character-based; the second five are primarily competence based; the last three
are equal parts character and competence).
As you go through these behaviors, you may also find it valuable to consider the opposite of these 13
behaviors and how such "withdrawals" deplete trust.
What’s most exciting is that these 13 Behaviors of High Trust Leaders can be learned and applied by any
influencer at any level within any organization. The net result will be a significantly increased ability to
generate trust with all stakeholders in order to achieve better results.
The 13 Behaviors of High Trust Leaders are as follows:

people nor distort facts. Don’t spin the truth. Don’t leave false impressions.

intelligence, and the third is a high energy level. But if you don’t have the first, the second
two don’t matter.”

it or not."
- Oprah Winfrey

Show you care. Respect the dignity of every person and every role. Treat everyone with respect, especially those who can’t
do anything for you. Show kindness in the little things. Don’t fake caring.
Don’t attempt to be “efficient” with people.
“The end result of kindness is that it draws people to you."
- Anita Roddick, Founder & CEO, The Body Shop
"If people know you care, it brings out the best in them."
- Richard Branson, Founder, the Virgin Group

4. Right Wrongs

Make things right when you’re wrong. Apologize quickly. Make restitution
where possible. Practice “service recoveries.” Demonstrate personal humility. Don’t cover things up. Don’t let personal pride get in the way of doing
the right thing.
"What I call Level 5 leaders build enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of
personal humility and professional will."
- Jim Collins
“Watergate wasn’t so much a burglary as it was the failure to recognize mistakes, to
take responsibility for them, and to apologize accordingly."

others who aren’t there to speak for themselves. Don’t badmouth others behind their backs. Don’t disclose others’ private information.
“If you want to retain those who are present, be loyal to those who are absent. The
key to the many is the one."

happen. Accomplish what you’re hired to do. Be on time and within budget.
Don’t overpromise and underdeliver. Don’t make excuses for not delivering.

“Get good people and expect them to perform. Terminate them quickly and fairly if
you make the wrong choice."

<-----Page 3----->Get Better
7. Get Better

Continuously improve. Increase your capabilities. Be a constant learner.
Develop feedback systems—both formal and informal. Act upon the feedback you receive. Thank people for feedback. Don’t consider yourself above
feedback. Don’t assume your knowledge and skills will be sufficient for
tomorrow’s challenges.
“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those
who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn."
- Alvin Toffler

Confront
Reality
8. Confront Reality

Take issues head on, even the “undiscussables.” Address the tough stuff
directly. Acknowledge the unsaid. Lead out courageously in conversation.
Remove the “sword from their hands.” Don’t skirt the real issues. Don’t bury
your head in the sand.
"We strive to tell everyone everything we can. We want a culture with open dialogue and
straight answers. In terms of our work with employees, we have been direct with them
even when they don't like the answer. Our goal is not to please everyone but instead for
them to trust that what we tell them is the truth. You can't work the tough issues we face
unless everyone, starting with the senior team, trusts one another."
- Greg Brenneman, former CEO, Continental AIrlines
“Leaders need to be more candid with those they purport to lead. Sharing good news
is easy. When it comes to the more troublesome negative news, be candid and take
responsibility. Don’t withhold unpleasant possibilities and don’t pass off bad news to
subordinates to deliver. Level with employees about problems in a timely fashion."
- Jon Huntsman, Chairman, Huntsman Corp.

Clarify
Expectations

Disclose and reveal expectations. Discuss them. Validate them. Renegotiate
them if needed and possible. Don’t violate expectations. Don’t assume that
expectations are clear or shared.
“Almost all conflict is a result of violated expectations."
- Blaine Lee
"An individual without information cannot take responsibility. An individual who is given
information cannot help but take responsibility."

for results. Be clear on how you’ll communicate how you’re doing—and how
others are doing. Don’t avoid or shirk responsibility. Don’t blame others or
point fingers when things go wrong.
“Few things can help an individual more than to place responsibility on him and to let him
know that you trust him."
- Booker T. Washington
"Remember, when you were made a leader, you weren't given a crown, you were given
a responsibility to bring out the best in others. For that, your people need to trust you."
- Jack Welch, former CEO, General Electric

CHARACTER AND COMPETENCE BEHAVIORS

Listen First
11. Listen First

Listen before you speak. Understand. Diagnose. Listen with your
ears...and your eyes and heart. Find out what the most important behaviors are to the people you’re working with. Don’t assume you know what
matters most to others. Don’t presume you have all the answers—or all the
questions.
"Nothing beats personal, two-way communication for fostering cooperation and
teamwork and for building an attitude of trust and understanding among employees."
- Bill Packard, Co-Founder, Hewlett Packard
“We’ve all heard the criticism, ‘He talks too much.’ When was the last time you heard

<-----Page 5----->Keep
Commitments
12. Keep Commitments

Say what you’re going to do. Then do what you say you’re going to do.
Make commitments carefully and keep them at all costs. Make keeping commitments the symbol of your honor. Don’t break confidences. Don’t attempt
to “PR” your way out of a commitment you’ve broken.
"Trust is established through action and over time, and it is a leader's responsibility to
demonstrate what it means to keep your word and earn a reputation for trustworthiness."
- Hank Paulson, CEO, Goldman Sachs
“Trust doesn’t mean they tell you everything. It doesn’t mean they don’t posture. But it
means if they say, ‘We will do this,’ they will do it. It is credibility. It is integrity."
- Scott Smith, Publisher, Chicago Tribune

Extend Trust
13. Extend Trust

Demonstrate a propensity to trust. Extend trust abundantly to those who
have earned your trust. Extend trust conditionally to those who are earning
your trust. Learn how to appropriately extend trust to others based on the
situation, risk, and character/competence of the people involved. But have a
propensity to trust. Don’t withhold trust because there is risk involved.
“People ask me how I’ve had the interest and zeal to hang in there and do what I’ve
done. I say, ‘Because my father treated me with very stern discipline: he trusted me.’
I’m stuck, I’ve got to see the trust through. He trusted me. I trust other people. And they
did the job."
- Robert Galvin, Jr., Former CEO, Motorola
"The chief lesson I have learned in a long life is that the only way to make a man
trustworthy is to trust him."
- Henry Stimson, U.S. Statesman

lot more happens."
