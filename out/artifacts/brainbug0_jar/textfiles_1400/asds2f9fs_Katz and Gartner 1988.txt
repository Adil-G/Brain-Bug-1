Properties of Emerging Organizations

This article explores the characteristics of emerging organizations
and suggests that emerging organizations can be identified by four
properties: intentionality, resources, boundary, and exchange. These
properties are defined and discussed. Suggestions are made for selecting samples for research on emerging organizations. Implications
for research and theory on new and emerging organizations are
discussed.
Two important concerns regarding research
on new organizations have not been adequately
addressed: how and why samples of new organizations are identified and selected. Studies of
new organizations confront the researcher with
the difficult problem of identifying the essential
properties by which organizations make themselves known. The irony is that when we turn to
the literature for guidance on how to identify
new organizations, our theories and definitions
about organizations assume that they already
exist; that is, the starting point for our theories
begins at the place where the emerging organization ends. Our goal is to probe the interaction
between entrepreneurship and organization theory to generate an understanding of the properties of emerging organizations and to offer possible avenues for further research.
The challenge of research on new organizations is to move toward studying organizationsin-creation, not just retrospectively studying
organizations that exist (Aldrich, Rosen, &
Woodward, 1986, 1987). Identifying the properties of emerging organizations gives researchers
a framework for distinguishing the different ways
in which the organization creation process might
occur as well as a way of organizing the search
for organizations-in-creation.
429

The focus on properties of emerging organizations permits us to study emerging organizations
as a natural extension, linked by common variables, to studies of existing organizations.
Through such efforts, we hope that research on
entrepreneurship can be better linked to organization theory, particularly work on new organizations, organizational stages, and innovation.
This article seeks to answer the questions: What
is an organization and what properties does it
possess as it comes into existence? Emerging organizations are organizations-in-creation, that
is, organizations at the stage in which all properties necessary to be an organization come together. Studying the emerging organization,
therefore, explores the territory between the
preorganization and the new organization.
Samples of convenience are used for most research on new organizations. This may be due
to the difficulty of finding new organizations, but
it also may reflect a lack of theory to guide researchers to a starting point for developing sampling frames. It is questionable whether these
samples of convenience (which often include
spin-offs of divisions from existing organizations,
mergers and consolidations, and organizations
that move to new locations) can be defined as
representative of the population of new organi-

<-----Page 2----->zations. For example, samples based on new
incorporations are unlikely to be representative
of the population of new organizations because
these include organizations founded as sole proprietorships and partnerships many years before incorporation (Birch & MacCracken, 1981).
We contend that population ecology- and entrepreneurship-based studies of new organizations
could be dramatically altered if sampling frames
were developed that identified "newer" new
organizations. Because we recognize the inextricable link between theory and method (Kuhn,
1970), the remainder of this article provides theory about emerging organizations as well as
strategies for identifying them.

Properties of Emerging Organizations
Definitions of organizations pose serious problems for researchers who attempt to identify the
characteristics of emerging organizations. Many
theories include complex properties that occur
only after organizations achieve some particular
size (Etzioni, 1964; March & Simon, 1958; Miles,
1980; Scott, 1964; Udy, 1958). Definitions based
on bureaucracy (such as Blau, Heydebrand, &
Stauffer's [1966] small bureaucracies,
Mintzberg's [1979] simple structure, and Jaques' [1976]
stratum-2 and stratum-3 bureaucracies) include
organizations with more than one person, levels
of hierarchy, and a division of labor. Similarly, definitions based on social organizations
(Barnard, 1938; Blau & Scott, 1962;Bonjean, 1966;
Nelson, 1968) include organizations with two or
more people, thereby excluding smaller entities
such as one-person or psuedo-organizations
(Star, 1979).
Definitions of organizations tend to focus on
the characteristics of organizations from either a
structural or a process viewpoint (Hall, 1977).
Structuralists, such as Weber (1947) and Blau
et al. (1966), focus on the structural attributes
(span of control, hierarchy, etc.) of the organization, whereas process theorists, such as Weick
(1979), Sarason (1972), and Aldefer (1977), focus
on the processes (often cognitive) used by individuals or groups to define the existence of the
430

organization. Also, there are other viewpoints
that combine both structural and process ideas
(Brittain & Freeman, 1980; Carroll & Mayer, 1985;
Georgopoulus, 1972; Hall, 1977; Hunt, 1972; Katz
& Kahn, 1978; Kimberly, 1980; March & Simon,
1958; McKelvey, 1980; Miller, 1978; Mintzberg,
1979; Thompson, 1967; Van de Ven, 1980a).
Most traditional researchers of entrepreneurship (Collins & Moore, 1964; Cooper & Dunkelburg, 1981; Mayer & Goldstein, 1961; McCelland
& Winter, 1969; Vesper, 1980) do not define organizations in organization theory terms. Instead,
these researchers are likely to identify types of
organizations, such as manufacturing, retailing,
and so forth.
We contend that midrange definitions that encompass both process and structural viewpoints
are the most useful for identifying the characteristics of emerging organizations. In particular,
we find McKelvey's definition very useful for
identifying emerging organization properties:
An organization is a "myopically purposeful
[boundary-maintaining] activity system containing one or more conditionally autonomous myopically purposeful subsystems having inputoutput resource ratios fostering survival in
environments imposing particular constraints"
(1980, p. 115).
This definition was chosen for a number of
reasons. First, it is well grounded in theory:
McKelvey elegantly assimilates both process and
structural characteristics from many previous
theories. Second, this definition considers the dynamism of organizations as an essential focus of
study. Third, the ecological perspective on which
this definition is based has led to significant
research on new organizations (Delacroix &
Carroll, 1983; Hannan & Freeman, 1987; Singh,
Tucker, & House, 1986). Finally, McKelvey's focus on organizational form (particularly variation in organizational forms) and his search for
taxonomic characteristics of organizations fits our
interest in identifying the properties of emerging
organizations.
Organizations emerge from the interaction of
agents (individuals, partners, groups, parent
organizations, etc.) and the environment. This

<-----Page 3----->particular type of interaction is unusual because
it reflects a synergy (Lewin, 1936; Maier, 1963) of
agent and environmental connections. In more
recent form, the outcome of the synergy has been
called emergent properties by Katz and Kahn
(1978). This concept inspired the identification of
properties of emerging organizations outlined
below.
McKelvey's definition illustrates four major
properties of organizations (including those organizations in the process of creation): intentionality,
resources, boundaries, and exchange. These
properties, which have both structural (resources
and boundaries) and process (intentionality and
exchange) characteristics, are the minimum necessary for identifying the existence of an organization. Also, these properties are reflected across
organization theories, especially across systemsoriented theories. The following sections relate
each of these properties to corresponding ideas
in the entrepreneurship and organization theory
literature and offer suggestions for how these
properties might be studied further.

of the various environmental sectors, for example, capital and industrial (Maidique, 1980;
Yip, 1982), technological (Cole, 1965), government-legal (Vesper, 1983), and community
(Bease, 1981; Birley, 1985; Pennings, 1982). At
the very beginning of the organization, intentionality may be no more than these cross-level
goals, but as the organization continues to exist
as a separate entity, it will possess goals that are
increasingly distinct from those of the agents and
the environment. This separate intentionality can
be indirectly evidenced through common belief
structures regarding the goals, purposes, history,
traditions, and methods that emerge within the
organization, such as studies of organizational
culture (Deal & Kennedy, 1982; Martin & Powers,
1983; Sarason, 1972), studies of the symbolic aspects of organizations (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1977),
studies of family business (Beckhard & Dyer,
1983; Savage, 1979), and studies of innovative
organizations (Hackman, 1984; Kanter, 1984).

Resources

Intentionality
In the organization theory literature, the word
intention is derived from the works of process
and cognitively oriented theorists (Aldefer, 1977;
Sarason, 1972; Shapero, 1975; Weick, 1979) who
focus on intentional factors, such as sense making, organizing, and enacting realities. Their
ideas are the least restrictive examples of intention because they use post hoc intention as well
as prior intention and focus on goals directly related to individual or group cognitive homeostasis, rather than higher order and more externalized goals.
We see organizational intentioncality as a label describing an agent's seeking information
that can be applied toward achieving the goal
of creating a new organization; McKelvey said it
another way: organizations are "myopically
purposeful" (1980, p. 115). Organizational intentionality at the time of creation reflects the goals
of the agents or founding entrepreneurs (e.g.,
Dooley, 1972; Van de Ven, 1980a) and the goals
431

The importance of resources has seen its most
recent emergence in the works of the resource
dependence theorists (Pfeffer, 1978; Salancik &
Pfeffer, 1977), the strategic planners (MacMillan,
1983; Yip, 1982), and the ecological theorists
(Aldrich, 1979; Hannan & Freeman, 1978;
McKelvey, 1980).
In organization creation, resources refer to the
physical components (versus informational or
ideational components inherent in intention) that
combine to form an organization. Human and
financial capital, property (real estate, equipment, raw materials), and credit form the building blocks of most organizations (Cole, 1965;
Kilby, 1971; Vesper, 1980). As the organization
and strategic theorists cited in the preceding
paragraph indicate, the ease of obtaining these
resources determines the strategic direction and
geographic distribution of new organizations
(Hannan & Freeman, 1978; Liebenstein, 1968).

Boundary
In organization theory, boundary plays an important but underemphasized role; often it is de-

<-----Page 4----->scribed in terms no more detailed than semipermeable boundary (Katz & Kahn, 1978; Tannenbaum, 1968) or boundary-maintaining activity
systems (McKelvey, 1980), or it is used as the precursor for describing other interests, such as
boundary-spanning activities (Adams, 1976). In
organization creation, however, boundary is of
major importance.
Boundary is defined as barrier conditions between the organization and its environment (Katz
& Kahn, 1978). That is, the organization itself exerts control over some of the resources in its environment (Schumpeter, 1934), namely, those
within the boundary, and establishes the physical and legal basis for exchange across its boundary (Cole, 1965; Kilby, 1971). In establishing a
boundary, the entrepreneur, parent organization, or environment establishes the organization's identity beyond that of the creating agent.
The creation of a boundary as one of the properties of the organization also implies the establishment of subsystems of maintenance (Cole, 1965;
Georgopoulus, 1972; Katz & Kahn, 1978). Before
committing to establishing an organizational
boundary, the agent can easily stop collecting
resources and cease stating entrepreneurial
intentions. With the boundary in place, and with
the environment reacting to the bounded organization as well as to the agent of its creation, the
creating agent is required to attend to organizational maintenance and must moderate some activities through the new entity.
At a practical level, the establishment of
boundaries, such as incorporations, tax number
requests, and phone listings, offers the first concrete and somewhat cleanly defined sampling
frames for observing organizations early in their
creation.
Boundary also distinguishes the individual-asorganization from the individual-as-worker. Researchers as disparate as system theorists (Katz
& Kahn, 1978) and dramaturgial sociologists
(Goffman, 1959) have used the idea of individuals conducting particular types of activity, such
as role behavior within a boundary, as a way of
defining the presence of an organization. Given
432

an individual's intention to start an organization
and the resources earmarked for it, boundary
serves to isolate these elements from the other
aspects of the individual's life. This is readily
seen when an individual establishes organizational boundary-identifying conditions such as
obtaining identifying symbols (organization
name, mailing address, post office box, telephone- number, and tax identification or taxexemption number) that distinguish work done
as an organization member (i.e., inside the
boundary conditions) from work done as an individual (i.e., work done outside the boundary
conditions).

Exchange
Exchange in organization theory and entrepreneurial theory refers to cycles of transactions.
These transactions can be across the borders of
subsystems (Georgopoulus, 1972; Katz & Kahn,
1978; Miller, 1978), within an organization, as
in the example of managing human relations
(Kilby, 1971), or across the organizational boundary with individuals, the environment, or other
organizations (Singh, Tucker, & House, 1986).
Common to most of these theories are two
notions: the repetitiveness or cyclic nature of the
exchange process and the need for the exchange
to benefit the organization. Once established,
exchange cannot stop without the organization
facing eventual dissolution. Unlike boundary,
there is an implicit normative element in exchange, making it easier to say that one exchange is more efficient or effective than another.
This poses a particular problem in newly created organizations, especially autonomous ones.
Over a given period of time, the exchanges in
these organizations may be inefficient, such as
selling products below cost in order to establish
a market share. Because of this, exchange is
viewed as the most dynamic and volatile of the
four properties. Also, researchers who focus
solely on studying profitable exchanges may unduly restrict the identification and selection of
newly created organizations in their early stages.
Unlike McKelvey (1980), whose concern was for

<-----Page 5----->effective organizations in the long run, we are
concerned with the existence of any exchange
process, not merely those that are advantageous
to the organization.
Because extraorganizational exchanges take
place in an established environment, identifying firms engaged in exchange is relatively easy.
The other three properties must be in place for
exchange to occur in an ongoing manner. The
environment's demands for records indicating
exchange in the legal, financial, and organizational sectors offer additional evidence of the
firm's existence (i.e., financial reports, credit
ratings, transaction records, such as sales slips,
etc.).
These four properties of emerging organizations are necessary for an organization to exist.
Unfortunately, because the properties do not become visible simultaneously, the opportunity to
find newly created organizations, especially organizations that die during creation, is differentially affected by the choice of any of the four
properties as a sampling variable.

Identifying the Emerging Organization
Ironically, despite our attempts to define what
an organization is and what its creation looks
like, we still must be prepared to conceptually
define and deal with the organization-in-creation. The four properties characterize a complete
organization. Yet we need to know more about
the process by which an organization evolves
from nothing to something; that is, we need to
explore that period of time in which the preorganization becomes the new organization. In
effect, to study organization creation, we must
use one, two, or three properties as sampling
frames to probe when preorganizations might
eventually become organizations.
The entrepreneurship literature is filled with
examples of different agents: new ventures
(MacMillan, 1983; Timmons, 1973), new units
(Perkins, Nieva, & Lawler, 1978; Van de Ven,
1980a; Walton, 1980), corporate entrepreneurship
programs (Kanter, 1984; Kimberly & Quinn, 1984;
Schon, 1967), ecological perspectives (Aldrich,
433

1979;Hannan & Freeman, 1978),and government
policies (Vesper, 1983). The problem with most
research on organization creation is that the researcher studies the organization only after it
has come into existence, although there are
exceptions, such as the study of the founding of
People Express (Hackman, 1984) or studies of the
formation of new units in existing firms (Kimberly,
1979; Kimberly & Quinn, 1984; Sarason, 1972;
Van de Ven, 1980).
Identifying the types of firms used in studies of
new organizations takes on particular importance
because of three influences. First, interpretation
disputes arising from the use of standardized
databases by Birch and MacCracken (1981),
Reynolds, West, and Finch (1985), and Armington
and Olde (1982) produced a new wave of concern for what is being measured when claims
are made that an organization has come into
existence. Similarly, Birley (1984) showed that
significant differences in the identification of new
firms result from the selection of the database.
Second, Star (1979) and Katz (1981) sought to account for nascent or precursor states of conventional organizations by describing the characteristics of one-person firms. Third, McKelvey
(1980) sought to develop taxonomies of organizational characteristics for use in the analysis of
organizational life datasets. Taken together, these
events suggest a new approach to defining the
organization, one based on describing existing
entities, rather than one based on theoretical
models. Such description has a tradition in biology, largely in taxonomic work, and reflects
what McKelvey calls an asymptotic model.
For all three types of studies, using a particular database was dependent largely on practical reasons (e.g., Which database has the largest number of entries? Which database can I
obtain access to?), rather than theoretical reasons (e.g., Does the database cover the population I am interested in?). The selection and assessment of the database was not guided by
organization theory. However, definitions do
make a difference in identifying the type of organization and its stage of creation.

<-----Page 6----->For example, Birley's (1985) idea of the emerging organization assumes that an entrepreneur
goes through the sequence of generating an
idea, setting up the firm, hiring employees, and
trading products. Identifying organizations as
they seek to trade products catches firms at a
later stage than identifying them when they are
hiring employees. For this reason, Birley used
unemployment insurance and Dun and Bradstreet databases in order to sample firms at an
earlier stage.
By using the four properties of emerging organizations described, researchers can build a
framework for analyzing potential sources of new
organizations in a way that permits the identification of organizations early in their creation
process. Sources of new organizations used by a
variety of researchers are categorized in Table 1.
Although the four properties define an organization, they may not appear simultaneously. This
preorganizational period (called gestation by Van
de Ven, 1980a, and prehistory by Perkins, Nieva,
& Lawler, 1978) in the organization's life is vital
because many fundamental decisions about
industry, location, size, market, and administrative intensity may be made during this time. As
a result, it is worth considering the usefulness of
the four properties as sampling frames for discovering emerging organizations at the earliest
possible moment.
Because the issues of identifying firms using
boundary and exchange processes have been
considered in great detail by Birley (1985),
Reynolds, West, and Finch (1985), Birch and MacCracken (1981), and Armington and Olde (1982),
we will focus on the properties of intention and
resources as alternative means of identifying new
organizations.
Using Intention to Identify Emerging
Organizations
If intention is described as individuals indicating their interest in organization creation, several sources of information may be of value for
identifying emerging organizations.

tend to have a high percentage of selfemployed individuals. Star's (1979) list of occupations is helpful for identifying those occupations of individuals who are more likely to

Implications
Using four properties of intentionality, resources, boundary, and exchange as guidelines
for identifying and selecting emerging organizations has implications for both methods and theory in organization theory and entrepreneurship.
For example, life cycle models of organizations,
such as those described by Van de Ven (1980a)
in organization theory and Timmons, Smollen,
and Dingee (1977) in entrepreneurship, would
benefit from an expanded description of the variables characterizing organizational birth.
We find that traditional organization theory
models (e.g., Greiner, 1972), strategy models
(Porter, 1980) of organizational stages, or even
the traditional entrepreneurship models of organizational stage (Timmons, Smollen, &Dingee,
1977)are less important to understanding the creation process than we originally thought. We
find that most theories of organizational stages
(organizational
have a macro perspective
changes in structure or process are studied over
long periods of time, from birth to maturity),
whereas our perspective is micro (organizational
changes in structure or process are studied primarily at the gestation, prebirth, and birth stages)
encompassed by the establishment of intention,
boundary, resources, and exchange. Consequently, organization creation models, like Katz
and Kahn's (1978) initial stages and Van de Ven's
(1980b) three-stage model, are more useful in
describing these micro interests. Researchers

issues.

These are examples of places where a researcher might locate potential entrepreneurs
who are seeking information about aspects of
organization creation. By seeking information,
individuals may indicate an intention to start an
organization. Identifying categories of information demanders, such as self-employed professions, comes in part from a model of selfemployed career choice developed by Katz
(1981). As mentioned earlier, the selection of any
of these lists will influence the types of emerging
organization one is likely to study.

Using Resources to Identify Emerging
Organizations
Previous conventions for categorizing resources (money, plant, equipment, employees,
etc.) are adequate as a starting point. If information is considered a resource, the previous list of
sources also could be included here.
1. Applications for loans from banks, savings
and loans, finance companies, and the Small
Business Administration;

privatefoundations,umbrella fund-raisingorganizations such as the United Way, and political fund-raising organizations;

435

<-----Page 8----->might benefit from increasing the degree of detail in traditional theories of organizational stages
to include important within-state events, or,
perhaps, by combining micro and macro stage
theories.
Finally, the ability to identify and select
organizations-in-creation
by using the four
properties provides an opportunity to explore
how the study of emerging organizations might
have an impact on some theoretical issues in
organization theory and entrepreneurship.

Emerging Organizations and the Population
Ecology Perspective
Population ecology's original question "Why
are there so many kinds of organizations?"
(Hannan & Freeman, 1977) places particular emphasis on variation due to newly created organizational forms as a major source of change in
organizational populations (Aldrich, 1979; Hannan & Freeman, 1984; McKelvey, 1980). Recent
critiques of the population ecology perspective
have questioned the validity of the claim of organizational diversity, and as a result, researchers have asked, "Why are organizations so similar?" (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). This view posits
that new organizations pattern themselves after
existing organizations; therefore, there will be
little diversity in organizational forms among the
population of existing organizations. We suggest
that there is a high degree of diversity in organizational populations, but this has not been recognized because the samples of new organizations
that have been used are too old. The effects of
selection or institutionalization of the population
of new organizations (depending on your point
of view) have already occurred by the time most
samples are identified and studied. For example,
liability of newness arguments (Carroll, 1983;
Singh, Tucker, & House, 1986; Stinchcomb, 1965)
could be much stronger if based on samples of
organizations identified at earlier ages. Singh,
Tucker, and House (1986) found only a modest
degree of liability of newness in their population
of new organizations. This, we believe, was due
to their basing their sample of organizations on
one property-boundary
(incorporation data).
436

Because most sampling frames focus on one
type of property (intention, resources, exchange,
boundary), there may be some advantage to selecting sampling frames that reflect properties
more likely to occur (or more likely to be recorded)
earlier in the process of emergence. In the Singh
et al. (1986) example, it is plausible that some
of the organizations they studied may have
emerged (demonstrated all four properties) long
before formal incorporation was sought. Incorporated organizations may represent old new
organizations, that is, organizations late in their
process of emergence. If the Singh et al. (1986)
sample had been an intention-based study
(which captures organizations at an earlier age),
a larger diversity of organizational forms would
have existed, and it is likely that the liability of
newness among these organizations would have
been much higher.
Diversity in organizational forms is likely to
be greatest when organizations are being organized, that is, when organizations are emerging, not after they have become established
organizations. We view the organization-increation as very transitory. Because an emerging organization lacks structural inertia, agents
may try and abandon many organizational forms
until either some type of organizational fit (both
internal and external) is mac-. or failure occurs
as resources are expended in the organizing
process. This is because the costs of changing
various goals, structures, and so forth are so
much lower for the emerging versus established
organization. The opportunity to identify organizations-in-creation through the four properties enhances a researcher's abilities both to observe
this variation and to study how it is generated.
In addition, selection pressures of emerging
organizations are likely to be greatest when the
organization is forming rather than when the organization already exists because emerging organizations are likely to have few reserves (Galbraith, 1973) to buffer shocks from environmental pressures. So while new combinations of organization forms are being attempted in these
emerging organizations, selection pressures are
simultaneously eliminating most of them. The

<-----Page 9----->ample, are likely to be conducted too late to
observe these near-misses. It is therefore possible that because researchers have not observed
emerging organizations and new organizations
early on, they have not recognized most entrepreneurial activity.

emerging organization is therefore a unique
situation in which both the organization's abilities to adapt and environmental selection pressures are high. By using the four properties as a
framework for selecting samples of emerging
organizations, we are likely to find a larger population of diverse organizational forms to observe
the effects of variation, adaptation, institutionalization, and selection.

Conclusion
The four properties of emerging organizations
provide a framework for identifying and selecting new organizations. The four properties also
provide commonalities between entrepreneurship and organization theory as well as links
between studies of emerging organizations and
existing organizations. Yet these properties also
have value for identifying organizations-beforecreation, that is, preorganizations. Prior to the
existence and interaction of the four properties,
there is something more than randomness but
less than an organization. These preorganizations vary according to which properties are
used, what order the properties appear in, and
how long the properties last. By focusing on
organizations-in-creation, that is, the transition
from preorganization to new organization, we
are likely to acquire a better understanding of
the nature of the concept of emergence and the
answer to the question "How do organizations
come into existence?"
Research on emerging organizations is fraught
with inherent ambiguity. Emerging organizations
are likely to be small, fragile, and volatile. The
process of organizational emergence may be
analogous to the types of interactions that take
place at the atomic and subatomic levels in
physics. In order for us to identify, analyze, and
understand the organization-in-creation we must
change our perceptions and methodologies.
Heisenberg's ideas on indeterminancy and complementarity (1958, 1971) may provide insights
into the limits of our quest.

Emerging Organizations and the
Entrepreneurship Perspective
A continuing challenge to entrepreneurship
researchers has been to focus on the process by
which organizations are created (Vesper, 1980).
Schumpeter's view (1934) that entrepreneurship
involves creating new technologies,
ideas,
products, markets, and organizational forms is
similar to the previous discussion on variation. It
is likely that doing something new will involve
creating variations of existing forms. Yet entrepreneurship researchers have been reluctant to
focus on emerging organizations and have frequently settled for retrospective work on smaller
existing organizations (Wortman, 1985). The effect of studying organization creation after the
fact has been to muddy the waters further in
differentiating new entrepreneurial organizations
from existing small businesses (Carland, Hoy,
Boultan, & Carland, 1984). The use of the four
properties as a framework for selecting samples
of emerging organizations is clearly appropriate
for enabling entrepreneurship researchers to
study organizations-in-creation.
The ability to
identify organizations early in the creation process should be valuable for determining the success and failure of different strategies for organizing. Vesper (1983) suggested that most entrepreneurial activities end in near-missesorganizations that die while emerging. Studies
of newly incorporated organizations, for ex-
