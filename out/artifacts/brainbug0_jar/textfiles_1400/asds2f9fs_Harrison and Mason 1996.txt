Developments in the
promotion of informal venture
capital in the UK

Introduction
The majority of small to medium-sized enterprizes (SMEs) in the UK, as
elsewhere, rely on self-financing – the personal capital of the owner and his/her
family and retained profits – supplemented in most cases by bank overdrafts
and loans and trade credit (University of Cambridge, 1992). Although equity
accounts for only a small proportion of the overall finance used by SMEs, its
availability is nevertheless of considerable significance for the vitality of the
enterprise economy: rapid growth firms and technology-based firms, which are
particularly important for economic development (Rothwell, 1989), are most
likely both to require and experience difficulty in accessing sources of external
long-term capital. There is a widespread perception among SME ownermanagers that there is a shortage of external capital, particularly equity capital;
on the other hand, there has been a number of significant developments in the
supply of equity finance for SMEs in the UK, including a range of public policy
interventions. In this paper we provide a brief review of the “equity gap” debate
in the UK and summarize some of the major private and public sector initiatives
designed to stimulate the supply of equity finance as a context for our main
objective, which is critically to review initiatives in the UK to promote informal
venture capital, a policy area where the UK arguably has a world lead.
The equity gap
Concern about the difficulties encountered by small firms in the UK in raising
loan and equity finance can be traced back some 60 years to the Macmillan
Report (HM Government, 1931). The problem to which it was the first to draw
attention, and was subsequently termed the “Macmillan gap”, was the lack of
provision for small- and medium-sized businesses seeking external finance up to
£200,000 – equivalent to about £4 million today – which at the time was too
small to justify a flotation on the Stock Exchange. One of the consequences of the
Macmillan report was the formation of ICFC (now 3i) in 1945 – the first specialist

finance for small- and medium-sized firms. However, the problems encountered capital in the UK
by small firms in raising external finance were again raised in the Radcliffe
Report in 1959 which pointed to the “danger, which is socially and economically
desirable to avoid, that the growth of small firms may be impeded because they
lack some of the facilities open to larger companies for obtaining capital” (HM
7
Government, 1959, para. 932). The Bolton Committee returned to this issue in its
1971 report (HM Government, 1971). It concluded that the precise gap identified
by the MacMillan Committee had been largely filled by ICFC but that small
firms nevertheless, “still suffer a number of genuine disabilities, by comparison
with larger firms, in seeking finance from external sources” (HM Government,
1971, para. 12.98) while in the specific case of equity finance they concluded that
“the market facing the small firm is relatively constricted” (HM Government,
1971, para. 12.87). The Wilson Committee to Review the Functioning of Financial
Institutions, which issued an interim report in 1979 on The Financing of Small
Firms (HM Government, 1979, p. 9), concluded that there had been no
improvement in the situation during the 1970s, commenting that “there are
deficiencies in the availability of equity finance for small business” which were
“putting undesirable constraints on their rate of creation and growth”.
Despite the introduction of a number of government measures designed to
improve the availability of finance for SMEs following the Bolton and Wilson
Committees as well as various institutional innovations (see Mason and
Harrison, 1991a, for a review), a variety of authoritative reports during the 1980s
(e.g. Hall, 1989; NEDC, 1986; Robson Rhodes, 1984) continued to highlight the
existence of an equity gap in the UK. For example, a report by the Advisory
Committee on Science and Technology (ACOST) on barriers to growth in small
firms, published in 1990, concluded that “there is a clear need … for the ready
availability of smaller amounts of risk capital” (ACOST, 1990, p. 35).
These constraints on the availability of equity finance for SMEs in the UK
have been compounded by recent changes in the lending practices of the major
clearing banks, which are by far the most important source of external funding
for small businesses in the UK (Binks, 199l; Cosh and Hughes, 1994). The banks
have sought to rebuild their capital base following substantial losses arising
from Third World debts, international property debts and corporate and SME
failures (Gapper, 1993a). From the beginning of 1991 to mid-1993, when business
failures were at their peak, the clearing banks had to provide over £3 billion
against possible losses on a small business loan book of £45 billion (Bank of
England, 1994). This need to restore their capital base was made more pressing
by new minimum capital adequacy ratio requirements of the Bank for
International Settlements (Plender, 1993).
The effects of these changes in policy can be seen in terms of the availability
and cost of bank loans and the conditions under which such loans are made.
First, the banks have become more cautious in their lending decisions and
tightened their lending criteria (Bank of England, 1994). Banks are now
requiring greater security for loans and are placing greater importance on the

<-----Page 2----->IJEBR

level of gearing. This in turn increases the need for firms to raise additional
equity finance, in many cases beyond that which can be raised from the personal
resources of the small business owner (Deakins and Hussain, 1994). The banks
have also sought to limit the access of small firms to overdraft facilities because
of their frequent use as a substitute for equity by undercapitalized businesses
rather than as working capital (Plender, 1993; Gapper, 1993a, 1993b). The
implication is that businesses can no longer expect to obtain what is in effect
equity finance but at overdraft rates of interest (Batchelor, 1991).
Second, recession has encouraged the banks to develop more sensitive risk
pricing systems and there is some evidence that the better quality proposals are
getting lower margins (Bank of England, 1995). Business size and the associated
perception of security is an important determinant of bank attitudes in its own
right, with bank managers regarding the bigger businesses as “better” than the
smaller businesses (Vyakarnam and Jacobs, 1991 ).
Third, the banks are increasingly taking the view that lending decisions
should be based primarily on an analysis of the borrower’s cash flow and
business plans, with the availability of security being regarded as an important,
but secondary, consideration (Bank of England, 1994). However, this requires
increasing monitoring of borrowers which imposes additional costs on the
banks and will, inevitably, result in an increase in bank charges.
Thus, while it is clearly misleading to talk of a small firm’s “credit crunch” in
the sense that there is a lack of available bank finance, there are undoubtedly
growing mismatches between what the banks are prepared to supply, and under
what conditions, and what small businesses demand (Mason and Harrison,
1996a). One type of business that might be expected to be particularly adversely
affected by such mismatches is growth firms: a study of fast growth businesses
in North East England by Storey et al. (1989) noted that this type of business was
the most likely to have experienced problems with banks. Many bankers,
accountants and other interested parties accept that the consequence of this new
attitude among the banks is that small businesses will have to seek finance from
other sources, notably venture capital funds (Financial Times, 1993); indeed, a
Midland Bank position paper states that “companies should recognise the
benefits of venture capital” (Midland Bank, 1993, p. 2), and there is evidence of a
greater willingness by SMEs to consider raising external equity finance (Mason
and Harrison, 1995a).
Institutional venture capital
The UK venture capital industry is the largest and most developed in Europe
(EVCA, 1994), having expanded from just 20 funds with a total investment of
£20 million in 1979 to the current situation in which there are more than 100
venture capital companies which invested nearly £1.7 billion in the UK in 1994
(BVCA, 1995a). However, the institutional venture capital industry is not a
realistic means of closing the SME equity gap for all but a small minority of
SMEs. First, venture capital funds are motivated by capital gains and so will
only give serious consideration to fast-growing businesses capable of providing

<-----Page 3----->an annual return of 30 to 60 per cent. Second, evaluation and monitoring costs Informal venture
which must precede and accompany venture capital investments are a capital in the UK
significant, fixed cost element, which makes it uneconomic for funds to make
investments of less than about £250,000: initial accountancy and legal fees, for
example, are unlikely to be less than £50,000 to £70,000, irrespective of the size
of the prospective investment (Batchelor, 1993). Third, the focus of the venture
9
capital industry is increasingly on the provision of development capital and
capital for management buy-outs (MBOs) and buy-ins (MBIs). Statistics
compiled for the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) indicate that in
1994 MBOs/MBIs accounted for 67 per cent of finance invested. By comparison,
there were just 177 investments in early stage ventures (down from 521 in 1989),
representing 14 per cent of all financings and just 5 per cent of the total amount
invested (BVCA, 1995). Fourth, institutional venture capital is also strongly
oriented to non-technology sectors (Murray and Lott, 1995). Fifth, because
institutional investors favour MBO/MBI funds, those independent venture
capital funds which specialize in early stage and technology investments have
experienced increasing difficulties in raising new funds, with a number exiting
the industry having failed to attract investors, confirming Murray’s (1990)
prediction of a shake-out in the industry. Technology investment is now confined
to just a handful of venture capitalists in the UK. Finally, venture capital
investments are disproportionately concentrated in the South East region,
reflecting, at least in part, the location of the majority of venture capital funds in
London (Mason and Harrison, 199lb). The development of the institutional
venture capital industry has, therefore, failed to address the existence of an
equity gap which can now be identified as having investment size, sectoral and
geographical dimensions (Mason and Harrison, 1995a).
Business expansion scheme
In parallel with the development of the institutional venture capital industry in
the UK, a major policy initiative to stimulate additional sources of new equity
capital for unquoted businesses in the UK was launched in 1983. Under the
scheme, private individuals could claim tax relief at their highest marginal rate
of income tax (60 per cent until the end of the 1987-1988 fiscal year, now reduced
to 40 per cent) on investments in unquoted, independent companies up to a
maximum of £40,000 per year. The government minister responsible for small
firms policy at the time stated that the objectives of the BES were first, “to
encourage new and expanded activity in the small firms sector” and, second, “to
encourage investment in high-risk activities, where the risk to the investor will
be at least to some extent commensurate with the generous level of tax relief”
(Hansard, 1984). On the surface, the initiative would appear to have been
extremely successful. Over £750m was invested in new equity in nearly 4,000
small- and medium-sized businesses through the BES between 1983-1984 and
1987-1988, with the amount invested rising each year. However, although this
represented a significant addition to the pool of venture capital in the UK it did
little to close the equity gap. Certainly, a high proportion of the businesses which

<-----Page 4----->IJEBR
2,2

10

raised finance through the scheme have received small tranches of equity capital:
56 per cent of companies raised less than £50,000 each. However, this accounted
for only 5 per cent of total investment. Conversely, 54 per cent of the amount
invested was accounted for by just 4 per cent of companies which each raised
over £1m under the scheme. Moreover, the proportion of total investment
accounted for by such large investments has risen in each year, from 30 per cent
in 1983-1984 to 65 per cent in 1987-1988. Thus, while the BES has provided small
tranches of equity finance to a large number of businesses, only a small – and
diminishing – proportion of total BES investment was been directed to this
purpose (Mason et al., 1988).
Following the extension of the BES in the 1988 Finance Act to include
residential property for letting under assured tenancy terms, the scheme largely
ceased to be a source of equity capital for the unquoted company sector. Ninety
per cent of the estimated £2,371 million raised under the BES between 1988-1989
and 1992-1993 has been for private rented housing projects (Inland Revenue,
1994). The BES also failed to channel significant amounts of finance to
technology-based sectors. Even before its extension to include investments in
private rented housing, the bulk of the finance raised through the scheme was
invested in service sector businesses, often asset-backed or property-related,
predominantly in the wholesale, retail, real estate and leisure sectors (Mason et
al., 1988). BES investments have also been disproportionately concentrated in
the South East region which has consistently contained about half of all investee
companies and up to two-thirds of the total amount invested between 1983-1984
and 1987-1988, compared with its one-third share of the total stock of businesses
in the UK (Mason and Harrison, 1989).
Informal venture capital
Based on the experience of the BES and the venture capital industry, and in the
light of constraints on the availability of debt and overdraft finance, it is
acknowledged that sources of equity finance need to be increased, not least to
make the UK’s SME sector less vulnerable to the exaggerated boom-bust cycles
which characterize the UK economy and which have weakened the sector in
comparison with that of other European countries (Plender, 1993, p. 8). In
particular, the role of the informal venture capital market in the financing of
SMEs has received increasing attention in recent years in the business press and
from government, small business support organizations and the financial
community. The informal venture capital market comprises private individuals
– commonly referred to as informal investors or “business angels” – who provide
risk capital directly to new and growing businesses with which they have no
prior connection. This growing interest is reflected in the fact that, whereas the
term “business angel” was largely unknown and unfamiliar in the UK in the
1980s, it had become part of the general business vocabulary by the early 1990s.
The role and potential of informal venture capital has been clearly established in
the USA (Freear and Wetzel, 1990; Gaston, 1989a, 1989b; Wetzel, 1986a, 1986b,
1987). The ACOST report concluded from this evidence that “an active informal

<-----Page 5----->venture capital market is a prerequisite for a vigorous enterprise economy” Informal venture
(ACOST, 1990, p. 41).
capital in the UK
Comparisons of informal investors in the USA, UK, Canada and Sweden
reveal few significant differences in their characteristics, investment preferences
and investment activity (see Mason and Harrison, 1995a; 1995b for a review).
Business angels are almost exclusively male and mostly in the 45+ age band.
The vast majority are either business owners, company directors or business11
related professionals (e.g. accountants, consultants). Most are also experienced
entrepreneurs, often having founded several businesses. They are generally selfmade and have a high net worth (although relatively few are in the super-rich
category). On account of their employment background, angels have a fair
degree of financial sophistication and are capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of prospective investments (Wetzel, 1987).
The case for public sector support for the informal venture capital market is
based on four characteristics of such investments (Mason and Harrison, 1995a,
1995b).
(1) Business angels invest in precisely those areas in which institutional
venture providers are reluctant to invest, in terms of the size of their
investments (typically less than £50,000 in the UK), stage of business
development (favouring start-ups and early stage ventures) and sector
(being relatively more inclined to favour technology-based firms).
(2) Business angels are geographically dispersed and generally favour
investments within 50-100 miles of their home/office, thereby helping to
retain and recirculate wealth within a region.
(3) Informal venture capital is “smart money”, bringing with it not just
capital but also hands-on expertise in the form of commercial skills,
business know-how and contacts from experienced investors with an
entrepreneurial background (Harrison and Mason, 1992a; Mason and
Lumme, 1995).
(4) The informal venture capital market is the largest single source of risk
capital for entrepreneurial companies, and in the UK is almost twice as
important to the SME sector as the institutional venture capital market
(Harrison and Mason, 1993).
What is even more significant is that the potential size of the informal venture
capital market is considerably greater than these figures suggest. First, the
informal investment market is an inefficient market: most business angels
cannot find sufficient investment opportunities that meet their criteria and so
have substantial amounts of finance available for informal investments. Many
angels contend that there is a shortage of good quality investment proposals,
although this may be associated, at least in part, with poor presentation by
entrepreneurs. However, shortcomings in the search process by entrepreneurs
and investors also play a significant role in contributing to the lack of suitable
investment opportunities. Most informal investors are not able to devote
significant amounts of time to what is generally a spare-time activity. As a result,

<-----Page 6----->IJEBR
2,2

12

most adopt a fairly passive approach to the identification of investment
opportunities, looking in an ad hoc, unscientific fashion, placing considerable
reliance on friends and business associates for referrals and rarely adopting a
pro-active search (Mason and Harrison, 1994). Thus there is a large degree of
serendipity in the number and quality of deals that come to an investor’s
attention. Studies in the USA and the UK indicate that a majority of informal
investors are dissatisfied with their referral sources and believe that there is a
need for improved channels of communication between investors and businesses
seeking risk capital (Mason and Harrison, 1992, 1994; Myers and Moline, 1988;
Wetzel, 1981). New entrants to the informal venture capital market who have
taken early retirement or redundancy, or are returning ex-patriates, or in some
other way are isolated from informal referral networks (for example, owing to
employment background or location) are often particularly dissatisfied with the
available sources of deal flow (KPMG, 1992). UK research indicates that
investors in the peripheral regions express the greatest dissatisfaction with their
existing referral sources. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are hampered in their search
for private sources of venture capital by the anonymity which most informal
investors strive to preserve. As Gaston (1989a, p. 1) has observed, both the search
by a business for an investor, and the search by an investor for an investment
opportunity “can be expensive, time-consuming affair[s]. The search is studded
with pitfalls and dead ends that often result in failure and frustration”. This, in
turn leads him to describe the informal venture capital market as “a giant game
of hide-and-seek with everyone blindfolded” (Gaston, 1989a, p. 4).
Second, the informal venture capital market is underdeveloped. “Virgin
angels” – individuals with the same self-made, high net worth characteristics as
active angels but who have not, for whatever reason, entered the informal
venture capital market as individual investors (Freear and Wetzel, 1992) –
considerably outnumber active investors. Wetzel and Freear (1996) estimate that
actual angels represent no more than 20 per cent of high net worth individuals.
Riding and Short (1987) estimate that active angels in Ottawa-Carleton comprise
only 5 per cent of those with similar demographic characteristics. The number of
active business angels is therefore only a small fraction of the potential number
of private investors. Research by Freear et al. (1994) in New England indicates
that, with the right enticements, over half of all virgin angels could become active
investors in entrepreneurial ventures. A small-scale survey of virgin angels in
the UK indicates that their inability to identify firms which require finance is the
main reason why they have never invested in entrepreneurial companies. Other
frequently cited factors are the high risks involved, concerns about exit routes
and their lack of expertise to appraise investment opportunities (Mason and
Harrison, 1993). A slightly different set of factors for not investing emerge from
the virgin angels that KPMG (1992) briefly discussed in their study of the
informal venture capital market in Scotland. Their conclusion was that these
individuals were not active in the informal venture capital market principally
because of unacceptable risks and a lack of tax benefits. Four factors, therefore,
seem relevant in seeking to convert virgin angels into active investors (Mason

<-----Page 7----->and Harrison, 1993). First, virgin angels would be prepared to invest in Informal venture
companies where they knew the management team personally, a major factor in capital in the UK
reducing the perceived risk factor in an investment (Binks et al., 1992). Second,
virgin angels might be willing to invest if they received information from a
trustworthy source on companies which wish to raise finance. The availability of
tax incentives is a third factor that might encourage virgin angels to invest. Both
13
the KPMG (1992) study and also US findings (Freear et al., 1994) have noted that
reduction in the capital gains tax would be the most influential factor in inducing
virgin investors to become active investors. Finally, US evidence indicates that
opportunities to participate with other, more experienced, investors was seen by
virgin angels as a major inducement to becoming active (Freear et al., 1994). In
contrast, UK virgin angels were not influenced by this consideration, a finding
that is consistent with the much lower levels of syndication of investments
reported by active informal investors in the UK compared with their US
counterparts (Harrison and Mason, 1992b).
The problems of inefficiency and underdevelopment in the informal venture
capital market both stem from an information problem: relevant, timely,
complete information on investment opportunities and potential investors is not
available in a way which is useful. The key policy requirement, therefore, if the
contribution of informal venture capital to SME financing is to be increased, is to
close the information gap, thereby mobilizing more capital by assisting the
market to work more effectively and efficiently and by increasing the number of
active business angels.
Business angel networks
Business angel networks (BANs) – alternatively termed business introduction
services – are an attempt to overcome the problems associated with the
invisibility of informal investors and the high search costs for businesses
seeking investors and investors seeking investment opportunities by providing
a channel of communication between informal investors and entrepreneurs
seeking finance. Their objective is to enable entrepreneurs to bring their
investment proposals to the attention of a number of private investors
simultaneously and provide both active and “virgin” investors with a convenient
means of identifying and examining a range of investment proposals while
retaining their anonymity until they are ready to enter into negotiations with an
entrepreneur. There are examples of BANs in the USA, Canada, the UK and
Scandinavia (Harrison and Mason, 1996). Most BANs operate on a not-for-profit
basis, with some or all of the costs underwritten by state or quasi-state bodies.
Indeed, experience in North America and the UK suggests that BANs cannot be
operated as a profit-making activity (Mason and Harrison, 1993, 1995a, 1996a,
1996b).
BANs typically operate on the basis of publishing an investment bulletin
containing brief descriptions of companies seeking capital which is circulated to
investors registered with the service. Some BANs also hold investor forums at
which entrepreneurs seeking to raise finance make short presentations to an

<-----Page 8----->IJEBR
2,2

14

audience of potential investors. A more sophisticated approach, less common in
the UK but widely used in the USA (Browne and Stowe, 1996; Wetzel and Freear,
1996) involves computer matching. It should be emphasized that BANs do not
function as dealers, investment brokers or investment advisers and are not
involved in any negotiations between investor and entrepreneur or in
structuring the transaction.
BANs are not a new phenomenon in the UK. Two BANs have been operating
for a number of years prior to the current interest in the role and potential of the
informal venture capital market in filling the equity gap. Venture Capital Report
(VCR), a private sector initiative established in 1978, publishes a monthly
investment bulletin containing fully-researched articles on approximately ten
companies seeking finance. Although run on a for-profit basis, VCR does not
genuinely make a profit as a service and relies on an internal subsidy (in the form
of below market salaries, etc.) for survival (Cary, 1996). LINC (the Local
Investment Networking Company) has been operating since 1987 as a coordinated national service. It is a not-for-profit network financed by corporate
sponsorship comprising 13 independent enterprise agencies (organizations
which provide advice and counselling to start up businesses) in various parts of
the country. Prior to the formation of LINC, some of its members had operated
independently on a local basis. In addition, over the years there have been a
number of other, generally short-lived, attempts by various public and private
organizations to run business angel networks. However, most quickly ceased
their activities, with the private sector initiatives finding it impossible to operate
at a profit (Mason and Harrison, 1996b). Those which did survive tended to be
small scale, low profile and informal and have not made a significant impact on
the informal venture capital market.
These pioneering matchmaking services had only modest success during the
1980s in unlocking the substantial sums of uncommitted money that most
business angels have available. In the case of LINC, a number of studies
undertaken in 1991/1992 indicated that it had a low awareness among informal
investors, small business owners and professional intermediaries (e.g.
accountants, bankers, solicitors) (KPMG, 1992; Mason and Harrison, 1994;
Shorter, 1996). This reflects the fact that it was under-resourced, thereby limiting
its marketing and promotion efforts, and had a patchy geographical coverage.
The consequence was a small client base of about 200 investors and about the
same number of businesses. More fundamentally, independent research
indicated that the scale of informal investment activity resulting from LINC’s
activities was limited (Mason and Harrison, 1996c).
Nevertheless, the concept of establishing mechanisms for bringing investors
into contact with businesses seeking equity capital and vice versa, as a means of
more effectively mobilizing the pool of informal risk capital remains sound. In a
review of the state of the informal venture capital market in the UK at the start
of the 1990s we argued, following Wetzel (1986a, 1986b, 1987), that “the
invisibility of informal investors, the fragmented nature of the market and the
imperfect channels of communication between bona fide entrepreneurs seeking

<-----Page 9----->risk capital and investors seeking investment opportunities creates a Informal venture
‘discouragement effect’ – analogous to the discouraged worker effect in labour capital in the UK
markets – which curtails the search for equity capital by both entrepreneurs and
would-be entrepreneurs and the search by would-be business angels for
investment opportunities, to the detriment of economic development” (Mason
and Harrison, 1991a, pp. 149-50). We therefore proposed that there should be a
15
major expansion in the number of financial matchmaking services to enable
businesses to tap the pool of informal venture capital more effectively. Given
research findings which indicated that investors prefer to invest close to home
(Mason and Harrison, 1994), we further argued that such services should be
established on a regional or subregional basis. Finally, as all of the available
evidence suggested that such services cannot be operated as a profit-making
activity, we proposed that some form of public sector support would be
necessary to achieve a significant increase in the number and scale of financial
matchmaking activities in the UK (Mason and Harrison, 1991a).
Against this background of increasing interest in the potential of informal
investors as a source of equity finance for SMEs, and the appearance of our
initial research findings, which provided confirmation of both the role and
potential of informal venture capital activity in the UK, the Government, in
October 1990, outlined, as a very tentative idea, the possibility of backing the
creation of business introduction services for investors and entrepreneurs.
Following a visit by the then Minister of State with responsibility for small firms
to the USA in the spring of 1991, when he examined some matchmaking
organizations in detail, the Government invited bids to run a number of local
demonstration projects. Although the Government was aware that there were
some existing networks and services which sought to bring together potential
investors and small businesses seeking finance, this initiative recognized that
more could still be done. In particular, the Government saw a clear role for the
Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs), as key players in the local enterprise
scene, to help in creating further networks and services of this type. Five projects
were selected from 19 bids, and the initiative was launched in October 1992, with
pump-priming assistance of £20,000 per annum for two years (subsequently
extended for a third year following an interim evaluation) for each
demonstration project to cover setting up and administrative costs which was to
be matched with similar contributions from the TEC or its partners. The
objective was to test the proposition that BANs are a worthwhile way of enabling
business angels to channel financial resources and hands-on expertise to small
firms by removing the financial constraint which had handicapped previous
matchmaking initiatives.
Impact of public sector business introduction services
A recent review of these demonstration projects undertaken on behalf of the
Department of Trade and Industry (Mason and Harrison, 1995c) has indicated
that they have had a considerable impact both directly and indirectly. Each
project started from a different level of knowledge and expertise, so progress has

<-----Page 10----->IJEBR
2,2

16

been achieved at different rates. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the projects have
expanded their client base over the duration of the initiative. By the end of the
three-year funding period the five projects had more than 250 investors
registered, although the cumulative total number of investors who have
registered at some time over the three years is almost 350. The majority are
private investors, but most of the projects also have some professionals who have
registered on behalf of their clients, and thus the number of investors who see
details of the investment opportunities exceeds the number who are registered.
TEChINVEST’s investor client base also includes venture capital firms and
companies that are seeking acquisition opportunities. The majority of investors
are local and most also want to be hands-on investors.
The mobilization of capital is impressive: registered investors with the five
projects are estimated to have in excess of £25 million available for investment;
moreover, this figure excludes corporate and venture capital funds and investors
who are represented by professional advisers who register on their behalf. The
projects have promoted almost 500 investment opportunities to investors over
the three years. At any one time the projects typically have between 20 and 30
active investment opportunities. Although the investment opportunities are
characterized by considerable variety, manufacturing firms are the single largest
category. Investment opportunities are also weighted to start-ups and early stage
and the “typical” investment opportunity is seeking between £50,000 and
£100,000, although in some cases (e.g. IRIS and Capital Connections) the typical
opportunity is seeking less than £50,000.
Assessing the client base of the projects is hindered by the lack of appropriate
yardsticks. Nevertheless, no matter what benchmarks are used – e.g. regional
venture capital funds, Midland Bank Enterprise Funds, LINC member agencies
– the performance of the demonstration projects is impressive, especially when
their small scale of operation is borne in mind; indeed, even in the USA, where
such services have been established much longer, there are few such services
which operate with larger numbers than these (Browne and Stowe, 1996).
Introductions and matches
Assessing the number of investments resulting from the activities of a business
introduction service is notoriously difficult. First, keeping in touch with
businesses and investors after the initial introduction has been arranged is both
time-consuming and expensive, especially as some negotiations can drag on for
months. Where a success fee is levied the business has a vested interest in
avoiding such follow-up contact or in providing misleading information. Second,
there are definitional issues concerning what can legitimately be claimed as a
“match” by the service. Third, increasing collaboration between business
introduction services raises the possibility of double counting. To date, the only
statistical information available is that collected and made available by the
project managers: direct contact with investors and businesses was not
undertaken as part of the review. In view of the close contact that is maintained
by project managers with registered businesses in particular we are confident of

<-----Page 11----->the accuracy of these statistics. The issue of double counting is not, to date, a Informal venture
problem with the demonstration projects, and we have been able to identify those capital in the UK
cases matched through other services such as VCR.
Bearing these caveats in mind, the five projects have together facilitated a
total of 64 investments involving a direct investment of some £3.7 million.
However, there is an issue of attribution in the case of four investments that have
17
been made through TEChINVEST and which involve venture capital firms as, in
at least three cases, TEChINVEST was only one of a number of means of contact
between the fund and the business. Excluding these investments reduces the
total number of matches to 59 and the amount directly invested to £2.7 million.
The project managers estimated that there were a further 10-15 investments
likely to occur in the near future. In addition, project managers report other
companies which have received offers of finance from investors but rejected
them. The majority of investments have involved amounts of less than £50,000
(and the average excluding the four venture capital fund investments is £45,763)
and most have involved local investors.
Indirect investment effects
The impact of business introduction services, and therefore the assessment of
their performance, extends well beyond these direct effects. At least five further
identifiable impacts should be noted. First, in a number of cases informal
venture capital has had the effect of unlocking further finance from the banks
(loans and relaxed overdrafts, including the loan guarantee scheme), and other
equity investors. It appears that this leverage effect is confined to a minority of
investments, but where it occurs – sometimes in the form of “financial packages”
– the additional finance considerably exceeds the amount invested by the
business angel. In the case of TEChINVEST, where investment information has
been collected in a systematic way, the businesses which were successful in
raising finance from business angels attracted an additional £3.745 million from
other sources. Moreover, this figure is likely to be an under-estimate. Put another
way, for every £1 invested by TEChINVEST investors, a further £2 has been
unlocked from other sources.
Second, in some cases the business angel will provide follow-on finance at a
later stage. Business introduction services are less likely to identify this because
it normally occurs some time after the original investment, by which time the
service may have lost touch with the business. However, recent research
conducted on behalf of LINC found that investors provided follow-on finance in
just over one-quarter of investments and that in these cases the aggregate
amount of follow-on finance was equivalent to 50 per cent of the original
investment (Mason and Harrison, 1996d).
Third, businesses may raise investment from investors identified through
contacts of investors that they are introduced to at investor clubs and seminars
rather than directly from investors who are registered with the service. Fourth,
companies may gain commercial benefits from the contacts they make as a result
of joining a business introduction service. Last, but by no means least, firms that

<-----Page 12----->IJEBR
2,2

18

have raised finance from private investors also derive benefits from their handson involvement. These typically take the form of a broadening and
strengthening of their management skills (Harrison and Mason, 1992a; Mason
and Harrison, 1996d).
Other indirect effects
There are at least four other significant impacts of the demonstration projects.
First, they undertake a wide range of advisory and signposting functions. In
most cases, over two-thirds of “serious” enquiries from businesses are
considered inappropriate for the service (this excludes the large number of
general calls for information), the absence of a good business plan and the poor
research and preparation of the proposal being the major reason why projects
fail to get beyond the initial enquiry stage. These businesses nevertheless derive
benefits from talking through their ideas with project staff and being given
signposting help and advice. Evidence from one of the projects indicates that for
every one business that is circulated to investors, another three or four
businesses receive significant help and advice, and for every business that
actually raises finance up to another 15 businesses receive significant help and
advice.
Second, businesses which have been put in touch with investors but have
been unsuccessful in raising finance nevertheless receive benefits in the form of
direct feedback from speaking to investors. In some cases, service managers are
also able to provide further investor feedback on cases where no direct contact is
made or expression of interest received.
Third, the projects have been active in seeking to educate investors,
businesses and professional intermediaries in the art and science of equity
finance by means of various forms of education and training activities. The
effect has been to improve the quality and expectations of investors and
businesses.
Fourth, although impossible to quantify, the demonstration projects can claim
some success in creating the beginnings of an equity culture in at least some of
their local areas by raising the awareness of equity among the local business
community, not least through the use of local press to highlight successful
matches.
Demonstration effects
There is no doubt that the projects have had an identifiable demonstration effect.
Most of the projects have been widely consulted by other TECs and Business
Links for advice and information on the operation of a business introduction
service and a number of the business introduction services which have been
established since the launch of the demonstration projects (see next section) have
clearly benefited from their experiences. Moreover, the demonstration effects are
not confined to the UK: Trevint, which manages the Devon and Cornwall project,
has advised members of the Atlantic Arc region on the establishment of business
introduction services. There has also been considerable sharing of ideas and

<-----Page 13----->information pooling between the demonstration projects, typically on a bilateral Informal venture
basis.
capital in the UK
Other business angel networks
The period since the launch of the DTI’s informal investment demonstration
projects has seen a massive growth in the number and range of BANs in the UK,
which can be attributed to the growing recognition of informal venture capital’s
role and potential as a source of finance for SMEs and to the demonstration
effects of the DTI projects themselves. This expansion in BAN activity has taken
two forms. First, there has been a revitalization of both VCR and LINC, which
have experienced increases in the numbers of registered investors, businesses
seeking finance and successful matches. Cary (1995) notes that the proportion of
projects which received all of the finance they sought from VCR subscribers
increased from an average of 27 per cent in the period 1978-1992 to 36 per cent in
the 1992-1994 period. LINC has also experienced an increase in the number of
successful matches since 1991 (Mason and Harrison, 1996c). These trends reflect
changes in the macro environment – the changes in the financial environment for
SMEs that were discussed in the introduction, the growing interest in informal
venture capital among both high net worth individuals (the supply side) and
owner-managers of SMEs (demand side) and the increase in media coverage.
They also reflect operational changes. VCR has significantly increased its
marketing effort which has, in turn, raised its profile, and has made various
operational changes, including changes to the format of VCR itself and linking
up with two of the DTI’s informal investment demonstration projects so that
some of their investment opportunities are also featured in VCR, thereby
exposing them to a national, rather than just a local, audience of business angels
(Cary, 1996). LINC has also made a number of operational changes, including a
re-designed investment bulletin, changes in venue for investment forums,
greater dialogue with investors and rationalization of member agencies (Mason
and Harrison,1996c).
Second, there has been an expansion in the number and diversity of BANs in
the UK. The number of networks listed in the annual British Venture Capital
Association directory has risen from 17 in 1993 to 32 in 1994 (BVCA, 1993, 1994).
Allowing for some deregistrations, there were still BANs listed in 1995 (BVCA,
1995b). Historically, in the UK as elsewhere, BAN mechanisms which seek to
“match” or otherwise introduce entrepreneurs seeking finance with private
investors looking to make investments in unquoted companies have been
dominated by public sector or not-for-profit organizations with a primarily local
or regional focus. However, it is possible to identify three shifts in the nature of
such networks in the UK. The basis for our analysis of these shifts in the
evolution of the business angel capital market is a classification of active BANs
listed in the BVCA directory (BVCA, 1993, 1994, 1995), with the addition of three
initiatives (NatWest Angels Service, Baronsmead Business Angels Fund and
CEX Partnership) which have been launched subsequent to the compilation of
the most recent BVCA Guide in December 1994 (see Table I).

<-----Page 15----->There is an important distinction between those services which operate on a Informal venture
local or regional scale, serving an area of typically one to two million in capital in the UK
population, and those which have a national operating area. As Table I makes
clear, local/regional services still dominate (18 out of 34 BANs). However, since
mid-1993 there have been 12 new initiatives launched, of which seven are at the
national scale. While not yet a sufficiently strong trend on which to base
21
definitive conclusions, this does raise the issue of the relevant operating scale for
such networks. It also raises two further questions. Are the investors who
register with local services different (in terms of capital available, preferred
investment size, venture stage preferences, geographical orientation and sector
preferences) from those registering with national services? And are the
investment deals facilitated by local or regional BANs different from those
facilitated through national networks?
A second distinction in the classification is between those services which have
been set up by or are run by and receive their financial support from public
sector agencies, notably TECs and Business Links, and those which are operated
by the private sector, normally on a for-profit basis. As noted earlier, most BANs
have traditionally operated on a not-for-profit basis by public sector agencies
(e.g. TECs) or the voluntary sector (e.g. enterprise agencies), although it is
normal for such networks to seek partial cost recovery through charging
registration fees). Increasingly, however, these public sector/not-for-profit
services have been joined by a range of private sector, for-profit networks: eight
of the 12 new networks started since mid-1993 have been established by the
private sector as commercially-oriented services. This recent entry of private
players into this market, including one of the major clearing banks, has led some
senior government officials to float the idea that this removes the need for
government involvement in funding BANs and that the public sector should
therefore withdraw and leave the market free to develop in its own way.
There are two types of private for-profit BANs. The first category provides
conventional matching services: these can be further subdivided into those
which produce and circulate investment opportunity bulletins (e.g. Venture
Capital Report, The Capital Exchange), and those which have created computer
databases of investment opportunities (e.g. Venture Net) and business angels
(e.g. NatWestAngels Service). The second category are offshoots of the corporate
finance activities of financial service companies which view the venture rather
than the investor as their client and, in part because of the economics of deal
appraisal and monitoring costs, have rather higher minimum investment
thresholds than do public sector/not for-profit services. They are likely to levy
charges which may include a success fee on those businesses that are successful
in raising finance.
A third, and emerging, distinction that can be made between BANs is in terms
of the types of mechanism which are used to match investors and businesses.
The conventional approach discussed earlier (e.g. investment bulletins,
investment forums, computer matching) still dominates: all of the public
sector/not-for-profit networks and 14 of the 20 private sector networks use

<-----Page 16----->IJEBR
2,2

22

conventional matching techniques. However, within the private sector there have
been two recent developments which significantly change the nature of the
informal investment capital market. First, a number of organizations (referred to
in Table I under the heading “ancillary service”) which specialize in matching
people – for example, experienced executive and non-executive directors – to
companies which have strategic gaps in their management teams have entered
the informal venture capital market. This arises from the fact that such
executives frequently wish, or are asked by the client company, to invest in the
company in which they are placed. Second, a new development in the UK is the
emergence of what may be described as “institutional archangels” –
organizations which identify, screen and structure investment prospects which
are syndicated among their network of business angels. These networks may, in
turn, have a fixed or floating membership. Normally the institutional archangel
receives a fee from the investee company for putting a deal together. Within this
category, the entry of some venture capital companies in seeking to create
networks of business angels is an interesting development. Some of these
venture capital companies are creating funds into which business angels will
invest, with the angel expected to play a passive role in the investment; in other
cases, the venture capital firm will match the business angel to businesses in its
deal flow, taking account of the angel’s investment criteria and experience.
The analysis of statistical information on the investments facilitated through
these BANs in 1993-1994 (Mason and Harrison, 1995d) confirms that such
networks can be effective in addressing the SME equity gap – identified earlier
in terms of the pool of capital available; the investment focus of venture capital
funds (avoiding small deals, start-ups and early stage deals, and technologybased firms) and the regional concentration of the industry. Over half of the deals
involved investments of under £50,000; over half provided start-up and early
stage financing; although still regionally concentrated, almost half of the deals
were outside the South East/East Anglia core region: and almost one-third of
BAN investor investment was committed to technology-based ventures.
However, these aggregate data, while supporting the argument that BANs
can be effective in closing the bottom-end equity gap, do not in themselves
address the issue of whether there is still a role for the public sector provision of
such networks: do public sector, not-for-profit BANs facilitate different types of
informal investment deal (in terms of size, sector, stage and location) than do
private sector networks? This question is answered by disaggregating the
statistics on successful matches by type of BAN (Mason and Harrison, 1995d).
Two points can be made. First, despite the emergence of new private sector,
nationally-focused BANs, the majority of deals in 1993-1994 were made through
local, not-for-profit networks, whose numbers have also increased, plus LINC
and VCR, both long-established national networks. However, many of the newer
private sector BANs have only recently been launched and so their significance
can be expected to increase over time. Second, it is clear that these new BANs are
involved in different kinds of deals from those of the local, not-for-profit services
and LINC and, to a lesser extent, VCR, which occupies an anomalous position as

<-----Page 17----->a private sector for-profit network but whose deal characteristics in a number of Informal venture
respects are closer to those of local, public sector/not-for-profit networks (Table capital in the UK
II). These private sector, for-profit networks are involved with larger deals
(which are also more likely to be syndicated between a number of business
angels or involve co-investors), later stage deals, including MBOs/MBIs, and
“low tech” manufacturing. In addition, a higher proportion of their deals are in
23
South East England/East Anglia. Although these conclusions are based on only
a small number of investments, an analysis of the investment opportunity
circulars of such organizations confirms this deal profile (Mason and Harrison,
1995d). Based on their stated modus operandi we suspect, although do not yet
have any supporting evidence, that such investments are less likely to have a
significant “value added” element. This could be regarded as the development of
a “merchant capital” form of informal venture capital industry similar to that

which has occurred in the formal venture capital industry (Bygrave and
Timmons, 1992).
Local, public sector/not-for-profit BANs, along with LINC, are therefore filling
a different market niche from that of private, for-profit BANs. The latter are
helping to fill a secondary equity gap from between approximately £100,000,
which is the maximum that most business angels wish to commit to a single
investment, and £500,000, which is the minimum investment considered by most
institutional venture capital firms, and which arises, in part, from the low levels
of syndication between business angels in the UK (Harrison and Mason, 1992b).
The emergence of private sector BANs does not therefore eliminate the role of
publicly-funded (through TECs and Business Links) local/regional BANs: these
BANs facilitate businesses, particularly start-ups and early stage businesses,
seeking smaller amounts of finance to raise equity capital from business angels
who typically wish to play a hands-on role. The implication is that if public
sector support for, and involvement in, locally/regionally focused BANs is
withdrawn, this will result in a decline in those informal investments which
involve smaller deal sizes, are oriented towards start-up and early stage
investments and have a high value-added element arising from the hands-on
involvement of the investors. It is unlikely that these types of businesses will be
able to turn to private sector, for-profit BANs to raise finance: they are less likely
to meet the investment criteria of private sector BAN investors and, indeed, will
in many cases fail to meet the acceptance criteria of these networks or afford
their fees. Continued public sector support for TEC- and Business Link-based
BANs is therefore essential to ensure that the informal venture capital market in
the UK continues to thrive and the associated economic benefits continue to
accrue.
Other policy initiatives
The main objective of this paper has been to provide a detailed account of the
recent development of attempts in the UK by both the public sector and the
private sector to develop ways of closing the information gap which represents
the primary factor underlying both the inefficiency and the underdevelopment of
the informal venture capital market. However, as the experience of the Business
Expansion Scheme in the UK and a range of other initiatives elsewhere
(Standeven, 1993) has shown, policy makers have also been willing to use the tax
system to provide a stimulus to informal venture capital. In the UK there have
been a number of revisions to the tax system, following the demise of the BES in
1993, specifically to encourage capital flows into unquoted SMEs. The key
measures are shown in Table III.
While innovative in intent, these initiatives are subject to the caveat that there
is little substantial evidence that business angels are likely to be significantly
influenced by the availability of tax incentives (with the specific exception of
provision for reinvestment relief on capital gains which is likely to be an
attractive incentive to encourage investment). Indeed, as business angels are
classically (and opportunistically) opportunity driven rather than incentive

driven, front-end tax incentives, such as BES or its replacement, the Enterprise
Investment Scheme (EIS), are less attractive than exit-related or capital gains
incentives which reward success. Further, front-end incentives may (as the BES
demonstrates) have a significant distorting influence on the risk return profile
which is a major weakness of tax-based incentives (see Table IV). Venture capital
trusts (VCTs), the other recent initiative, will also have very little appeal to
business angels specifically because, as pooled funds, they exclude any angel
involvement in the investment decision and make no provision for the exercise of
a business angel hands-on role. As managed funds, VCTs are also likely to be
subject to the problem, increasingly experienced by BES funds, of costeffectively making small investments within the equity gap. As we have already
observed, professionalization of the informal venture capital market is likely to
support the emergence of a “merchant capital” orientation biased towards larger
deal sizes, lower risk investments and a lack of value-added investments.
Business angels earn their rewards for risk taking from capital gains (Wetzel,
1995). Thus, as far as tax incentives for informal venture capital are concerned,
the key requirement is not to introduce new front-end incentives or initiatives on
the lines of the EIS and VCTs but to provide incentives which reward risk taking
in the form of capital gains tax relief. The availability of roll-over relief might
therefore be expected to lead to an increase in the willingness of private

that business angels treat investments on their merits and a tax break is unlikely capital in the UK
to alter their judgement of what constitutes a good and a bad investment
opportunity. Thus, in order to encourage both active and virgin business angels
to make some of their disposable wealth available for investing in smaller
companies the policy objective should be to remove distortions in the tax system
27
(which favour pension funds and housing) in order to make the tax treatment of
equity investment in unquoted companies no less advantageous than other
forms of saving (CBI, 1993).
Finally, there is evidence that the Financial Services Act (FSA) contains
sufficient ambiguity relating to the operation of formal and informal business
introduction activities to dissuade professional intermediaries in particular from
becoming more significantly involved in ad hoc or informal matching.
Clarification of FSA requirements in this area could do much to improve
the ability of these intermediaries to act as “archangels”, putting together
syndicates of informal investors from among their clients and contacts to invest
in deals that they identify through their commercial activities, a feature which is
common in the US informal venture capital market (Spragins, 1991). Indeed, the
relative absence of this form of informal investment activity may be a significant
contributory factor to the low level of syndicated deals by informal investors in
the UK compared with the USA (Harrison and Mason, 1992b). The Government
is currently examining the scope for relaxing the FSA to improve the supply of
information on smaller investment opportunities (HM Government, 1994).
Conclusion
Concern about the existence of an equity gap in the UK has been longstanding,
but the debate about the nature and scale of this gap has intensified in the 1990s
in the light of two developments in particular. First, there has been a number of
changes in banking practice with respect to SME lending, particularly for startup and other perceived higher risk cases. Second, there is growing evidence that
both private sector (e.g. the expansion of the venture capital industry) and public
sector initiatives (e.g. the Business Expansion Scheme) in the 1980s have largely
failed to close the equity gap. Earlier debates about policy responses to the
equity gap have focused on institutional responses. However, the current debate
has been characterized by an increased recognition of the role of business angel
financing in supporting the development of a strong SME sector and of its
untapped potential. Tax incentives to promote informal venture capital are not
an adequate response to the inefficiency and underdevelopment of the informal
venture capital market. Pooled investment vehicles, such as the recently
launched Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) in the UK, are likely to favour larger
investments and will not appeal to the majority of genuine business angels who
will wish to rely on their own judgement of investment opportunities rather than
those of investment fund managers. Business angels are also likely to be deterred
by the eligibility rules of tax-based schemes such as the Enterprise Initiative
Scheme (EIS). A more appropriate policy response is to explore ways of making

the informal venture capital market operate more efficiently to release its
untapped potential, rather than to seek to develop new forms of financial
product or institution within the public sector.
In this paper we have presented a summary of the development and impact of
a number of private and public sector initiatives to stimulate the flow of informal
venture capital in the UK. Given that information incompleteness is the key to
both inefficiency in the informal venture capital market (investors and
entrepreneurs cannot find one another) and the under-development of that
market (there is considerable untapped investment potential among non-active
investors), the provision of business introduction services is a cost-effective
mechanism for improving the supply of informal venture capital. Our review of
the DTI’s five informal investment demonstration projects has highlighted their
impact in mobilizing a number of substantial regional pools of informal venture
capital and facilitating a number of investments, as well as generating a number
of indirect effects. A number of other TECs and Business Links have also
established local BANs, and while it is impossible convincingly to establish
cause and effect we are in no doubt that in many cases this can be attributed to
the demonstration effect of the pilot projects. Moreover, as we have argued
elsewhere (Mason and Harrison, 1995a), the “bang for the buck” in terms of the
additional economic activity that has been stimulated as a result of the activities
of TEC and Business Link BANs is substantially greater than would have been
achieved if the same sums of public money had been used to channel finance to
the SME sector in other ways (e.g. BES-style tax incentives; public sector venture
capital funds).
So where does policy go from here? The 1993 White Paper stated that
“DTI will work with the private sector, Business Links and TECs to raise
awareness of … [informal investment] … finance and develop national coverage
of a local brokerage service throughout England. In Scotland the Enterprise
networks already provide similar services” (HM Government, 1993, p. 105,
emphasis added). However, the geographical coverage of local BANs in England
and Wales remains incomplete. Our perception is that after this initial burst of
enthusiasm, DTI policy on informal venture capital has recently entered
something of a limbo. There are two main reasons for this. First, TECs and
Business Links have a high degree of autonomy: DTI’s role is therefore nondirective and lies primarily in the dissemination of information. DTI has
therefore included information in its strategic guidance notes for TECs which
expands on its commitment in the 1994 Competitiveness White Paper to learn
the lessons of the informal investment demonstration projects and disseminate
them (HM Government, 1994). Nevertheless, DTI cannot require TECs and
Business Links to establish BANs. Second, DTI does not see the need to
supplement its advice to TECs and Business Links on the establishment of
BANs with central funding. We attribute this position, at least in part, to the
emergence of various private sector BANs: DTI is understandably hesitant about
intervening if the private sector is going to come up with solutions and under
these circumstances has raised the question of whether further public sector

<-----Page 23----->involvement is necessary or appropriate. However, as the informal venture Informal venture
capital market has developed it has become clear that private sector BANs are capital in the UK
not a realistic substitute for public sector involvement.
Our review of the operation of BANs in the UK has clearly established that
public sector funded services play a role that is complementary to that of the
privately-funded, nationally-focused BANs. First, public sector funded services
29
are more likely than most private sector services (VCR being the notable
exception) to close the various key dimensions of the equity gap (in terms of
investment size, sector and geographical location) by facilitating smaller, more
regionally dispersed deals. Second, many of the private sector BANs derive a
number, and in some cases all, of their investment opportunities through
networking with various local BANs; the disappearance of publicly-funded local
BANs could, therefore, adversely affect many of the privately operated national
BANs by reducing or eliminating their deal flow. Third, there is a
complementarity between the public sector and private sector BANs in terms of
their geographical scale of operation. As we have argued elsewhere (Mason and
Harrison, 1996b), the most appropriate geographical scale for the operation of a
BAN is the “region” (2-5 million population, depending on population density):
the majority of business angels invest within 100 miles of their home or office
(equivalent to a maximum of one to two hours’ travel time); and this scale of
operation has advantages in terms of both the promotion of the service through
local networking and other personalized approaches, and the provision of
appraisal, counselling, signposting and training activities of the BANs. There
are, however, some investors with no geographical limitations on their
investment preferences who will be interested in receiving investment
opportunities from throughout the country. Equally, some businesses, such as
those seeking large amounts of finance (in excess of £100,000) and those in
technology-based sectors, may require to undertake a more extensive
geographical search for potential investors. For such investors and businesses,
national BANs have the advantage that they enable investors to examine nonlocal investment opportunities and enable entrepreneurs to reach a wider range
of potential investors and avoids the expense and inconvenience of registering
with several local/regional BANs.
In view of these complementarities, the emergence of private sector BANs
should not be allowed to influence the direction of DTI policy towards informal
venture capital in general, and to BANs in particular. A top priority should,
therefore, be to implement the commitment in the 1993 White Paper to ensure
that all parts of England and Wales are served by local/regional BANs, as is
already the case in Scotland (through Scottish LINC which is funded in part by
Scottish Enterprise). The appropriate way forward might be based on the
development of networking arrangements between a comprehensive network of
local/regional BANs and a national, privately operated, BAN. However, an
acceptable operational blueprint has yet to emerge from the various competing
approaches that are currently in existence. First, Venture Capital Report has
established bilateral arrangements with some local BANs to feature their

<-----Page 24----->IJEBR

30

investment opportunities in VCR, particularly if the opportunity is felt to be too
large (in capital required terms) or too specialized to ensure an investor match at
the local scale. Second, the NatWest Business Angels Service has launched a
national register of business angels who are matched by computer against
investment opportunities which are provided by a number of local
intermediaries (mainly local BANs).
Third, VentureNet operates with a network of “Introducer Champions” (which
can be local BANs, TECs, Business Links, enterprise agencies, chambers of
commerce or from the private sector, such as accountancy firms and solicitors)
which submit businesses that have met the Information Quality Standard to a
national online database of investment opportunities which investors can
interrogate using their own search criteria.
However, early evidence suggests that the benefits of such local/national
networking arrangements can be overstated. Most investments still occur
locally, and even where local BANs are networked with national BANs the vast
majority of successful matches have involved local investors. Moreover, whereas
the private sector national BAN depends on their local partner to promote the
service and undertake counselling and vetting, the local BAN does not have the
same degree of dependency on the national service. Accordingly, if the supply of
informal venture capital in the UK is to be increased, there is a need for
continued local intervention and support from the public sector to ensure that a
complete network of local/regional BANs exists to meet the needs of both
companies and investors.
