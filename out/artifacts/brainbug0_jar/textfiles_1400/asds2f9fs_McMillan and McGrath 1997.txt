Open up your thinking to your customer's entire experience with yourproduct or service.

Discovering New Points of Differentiation

by Ian C. MacMillan and Rita Gunther McGrath
Most profitable strategies are built
on differentiation: offering customers something they value that
competitors don't have. But most
companies, in seeking to differentiate themselves, focus their energy
only on their products or services. In
fact, a company has the opportunity
to differentiate itself at every point
where it comes in contact with its
customers - from the moment customers realize that they need a product or service to tbe time when they
no longer want it and decide to dispose of it. We believe that if companies open up their creative thinking
to their customers' entire experience
with a product or service - what we
call the consumption chain - they
can uncover opportunities to position their offerings in ways that
they, and their competitors, would
never have thought possible.
Take the case of Blyth Industries,

ating and redifferentiating its products, Blyth has been able to grow
from a $2 million U.S. producer of
candles used for religious purposes
to a global candle and accessory
business with nearly $500 million in
sales and a market value of $1.2 billion. Not bad for a company in an industry that, as CEO Robert B. Goergen says, "bas been in decline for
300 years." Blytb's story is, quite
simply, a manifestation of tbe power
of strategic differentiation.
Business bistory is full of stories
of entrepreneurs wbo stumbled
upon a great idea that then became
the cornerstone of a successful company. But finding ways to differentiate one's company doesn't have to
be an act of genius or intuition. It is
a skill that can he developed and

of differentiation and develop the

ability to generate successful differentiation strategics. The first part,

can elicit numerous ways to differentiate even the most mundane
product or service.

( Mapping the
Consumption Chain
As we've said, the first step toward
strategic differentiation is to map
your customer's entire experience
with your product or service. We recommend that companies perform
this exercise for each important customer segment.
To hegin, assemble groups from
all areas of your company - in particular, tbose employees who use
marketing data and those who have

they first become aware of your
product to the time when they finally have to dispose of it or discontinue using it.
Naturally, every product or service will have a somewhat different consumption chain. However, a
few activities are common to most
chains. Consider the following questions, eacb of which illustrates one
of those activities. Then, as the
group begins to get a feel for the special relationship between your customers and your products, ask questions ahout more complex activities
tbat pertain to your business.
How do people hecome aware of
their need for your product or service? Are con-

sumers aware tbat you
can satisfy their need?
Are they aware that they
even bave a need tbat can
be satisfied? Your company can create a powerful source of differentiation if it can
make consumers aware of a need in
a way that is unique and subtle.

The first step is to map

customers. Charge the groups with

which customers pass from the time

Consider the problem of differentiating an everyday consumer prod-

uct, such as a toothbrush. For many
people, brushing is a ritual to which
they pay relatively little attention.
As a consequence, many brushes are
used well past the point when their
bristles are worn and are no longer
effective. Toothhrusb maker Oral-B
discovered a way to capitalize on
this widespread hahit. Tbe company,
by introducing a patented blue dye
in the center bristles of its toothbrushes, found a way to have the
brusb itself communicate to tbe customer. As the brush is used, the dye
gradually fades. When the dye is
gone, tbe brush is no longer effective
and should be replaced. Customers
are thus made aware of a need that
previously had gone unrecognized.
So far, the idea sounds like something out of Marketing 101. What
gives it particular value is tbat the
need can be filled only by Oral-B's
patented process. The company
turned differentiation into a competitive advantage.
How do consumers find your of-

fering? Opportunities for differentiating on the hasis of the search

competitors do not offer theirs (tbe
mini McDonald's outlets in WalMart stores), and making your product ubiquitous (Coca-Cola). Making
the search process less complicated,

and more habitual are all ways in
which companies can differentiate
themselves. And when competitors

not right away-you bave the potential for a strategic advantage.
One example is tbe rapid growth
of catalog sales in channels formerly

breathtaking range of products over
tbe telephone or through the Internet, without enduring tbe inconvenience of visiting a showroom and
the often inadequate knowledge of
the floor sales staff. The PC Connection & Mac Connection, a company
that sells computers through its
catalog, operates a 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week toll-free pbone

What happens when your product
or service is delivered? An often
overlooked opportunity for differentiation lies in considering what bas
to happen from tbe time a company
delivers a product to the time tbe
customer actually uses it. Opening,
inspecting, transporting, and assembling products are frequently major
issues for customers.
That applies even to tbe delivery
of services. Consider how difficult it
can be to get an auto accident claim
processed and paid by an insurance
company. Now consider bow Progressive Insurance of Cleveland,
Ohio, tackled the problem. Tbe
company has a fleet of claims adjusters on the road every day, ready
to rush to the scene of any auto accident in their territory. There they
can record all the information they
need and often settle claims on the
spot for policybolders. The process
has greatly increased customer satisfaction by eliminating the hassle
and delay that so often accompany
conventional reporting, inspection.

and assessment methods. A side
benefit for the company is tbat its
approach also has decreased tbe incidence of fraud hy reducing tbe opportunity to file false claims and inflate repair bills.
How is your product installed?
This step in tbe consumption chain
is particularly relevant for companies with complex products. For example, installation has presented an
enormous barrier for computer manufacturers trying to hreak into the
novice-PC-user market. Computer
beginners are notoriously intolerant
of sucb on-screen messages as "Disk
Error 23."
Compaq Computer, with its Presario line, was among tbe first to target installation as a source of differentiation. Instead of providing an
instruction book filled with technical terminology, Compaq offers its
customers a poster that clearly illustrates the ten installation steps. Tbe
company uses color-coded cords, cahles, and outlets to simplify installation further and also has rigged its

computers so that a cheerful video
and audio presentation leads new
users through the setup and registration process when they first turn on
the machine.
How is your product or service
paid for? Many companies unwittingly cause tbeir customers major
difficulties with their payment policies. Here's a test to see whether
payment might he sucb an issue for
your customers: Take a walk over to
your accounts-receivable department and ask to see a copy of a recent invoice. If your company is
anything like ahout 80% of those
we have worked with, the invoice
will be virtually incomprehensible.
Why? Because invoices are generally
designed by systems people for systems, not customers. Given the
prevalence of this situation, your
company may find opportunities to
set itself apart hy making the whole
payment process easier for customers to understand.
You may discover even greater opportunities by rethinking why your
company uses its current payment
policy in tbe first place. We once
worked with a company in the energy control husiness tbat was having
a hard time selling its services to residential co-op owners. At every coop, the company ran into opposition
from a hard core of owners who resisted the capital outlay involved in
installing an energy management
system. The company eventually
won a huge share of tbe co-op market by altering its policy, Customers
no longer pay an up-front installation fee; instead, they pay over time,
out of tbe energy savings.
How is your product stored? When
it is expensive, inconvenient, or
downright dangerous for customers
to have a product simply sitting
around, tbe opportunities for differentiation abound. Air Products and
Chemicals, a producer of industrial
gases, grew to dominate its market
segments by addressing the problem of storage. Realizing that most
of its customers - chemical companies-would rather avoid the hurden
of having to store vast quantities of
dangerous high-pressure gases. Air
Products built small industrial-gas
plants next to customers' sites. Tbe

move pleased customers; it also generated switching costs. Best of all,
once an Air Products plant was in
place, competitors had httlc opportunity to move in.
How is your product moved
around? What difficulties do customers encounter when they must
transport a product from one location to another? Whether the journey is across a room or across a state,
this step in the consumption chain
is another often-overlooked opportunity for differentiation. Ask yourself the following questions: Does
the customer find the product fragile? Difficult to package? Awkward
to move?
Consider how John ScuUey's marketing team at Pepsi-Cola used
packaging as a way to differentiate
Pepsi from Coke. Sculley's team created a distinct-if temporary-advantage for Pepsi in the early 1970s hy
designing plastic bottles that were
lighter, and thus easier for customers to carry, than the heavy glass
bottles of the time. The beauty of
the move was that it not only made
carrying soda easier, but it also reduced the advantage of Coke's wellknown contoured glass bottle. At
the time, it was difficult to produce
plastic bottles in that shape.
What is the customer really using
your product for? Finding better
ways for customers to use a product
or service is a powerful differentiator. And such opportunities abound,
especially for companies whose
products are expensive and used
relatively infrequently. General Electric's Transportation Systems division, which manufactures dieselelectric locomotives, used this step
in the consumption chain as the basis for rethinking its business.
With few exceptions, the railroads
that are the customers for GE's locomotives are not all that attached to
a particular unit. What tbey really
want to know is, if they bave freight
to ship, will a locomotive be there to
haul it ? GE is working on an arrangement through which the company
will guarantee that a locomotive
will be available on demand. Under
that arrangement, GE will take over

lieve the customer of repair and
maintenance concerns, and also will
gain economies of scale hy managing
an entire network. What's more, the
entry barrier created hy such a system can be formidable.
What do customers need help
with when they use your product?
The company with the most helpful
response has a significant advantage
here. GE, for instance, bas an enormously popular 800 number that is
availahle 24 hours a day to help people who have difficulty using any of
the company's consumer products.
Similarly, Butterball Turkey's 24hour hot line fields cooking questions from hundreds of customers
every Thanksgiving. Butterball has
recently supplemented its hot line
with an Internet home page and a
turkey-cooking guide that its customers can download.
What about returns or exchanges?
Too many companies put all their
efforts into the selling side of the
product life cycle, forgetting that
long-term loyalty requires attention

to customers' needs throughout
their experience with a product.
Handling things well when the product doesn't work out can be as powerful as meeting the need that motivated the initial purchase.
Nordstrom is an excellent example of a company that has taken this
issue to heart. The clothing retailer
captured national publicity in the
1970s when one of its store managers "took back" a set of tires from
a customer despite the fact that
Nordstrom did not sell tires. By focusing on and aggressively promoting its no-questions-asked return
policy, Nordstrom has enhanced its
position as a company that provides
unique customer service. Customers
may he unhappy with the hrands

How is your product repaired or

influence a lifetime of subsequent
purchases.

An ideal solution, used by Tandem Computers - a company that
makes computers with parallel central-processing units for applications
in which downtime is a major prohlem - is to try to repair a product
even before the customer is aware
that such service is needed. Tandem
staff members can spot a malfunctioning component through remote
diagnostics, send the appropriate
part and instructions to the customer hy express mail, and walk the
customer through the repair process
on the phone. This approach has almost completely eliminated expensive and inconvenient downtime for
the company's customers; it also has
eliminated their need for a costly onsite service force.
Otis Elevator uses remote diagnostics in a different way. In high-traffic
office buildings, where servicing elevators is a major inconvenience to
occupants and visitors alike, Otis
uses its remote-diagnostics capabilities to predict possible service interruptions. It sends employees to carry
out preventive maintenance in the
evening, when traffic is light.

is disposed of or no longer used? In

increasingly economical simply to

them, what do customers do with

Canon offers an interesting example of how a company can differentiate itself at this step in the chain. It
has developed a system that allows
customers to return spent printer
cartridges at Canon's expense. The
cartridges are then rehabilitated and
resold as such. The process makes it
easy for customers to return used
cartridges: all they need to do is drop
the prepaid package off at a United
Parcel Service collection station. At
the same time, it enhances the image of Canon as an environmentally
friendly organization.

Candles, when you think about it,
can play a role in everyday life in a
host of different ways. Among other
things, they are used to celebrate
birthdays, create a festive atmosphere for dinner parties, warm buffet dishes, cope with power outages,
and set the mood for
romantic evenings.
Candles can be purchased in specialty
shops, at crafts fairs, in
supermarkets, and at
card stores. Further,
their use can be accompanied hy a huge
variety of containers,
displays, accents, and mood-creating
products. All this suggests that candle makers might do well to explore
the possihility of offering a complete
"candlelight experience" hy producing or marketing complementary
products as well.

ways interacting with people,
places, occasions, or activities.
Those interactions determine the
customer's feelings toward your
product or service at each link in the
chain. When they are viewed strategically, they can shape the dynamics
of competition for that customer's business.
Essentially, this step involves considering how a series of simple questions-what, where, who. when, and
how-apply at each link in the consumption chain. We have found that
tbe most rewarding way to approach
this exercise is to have a group of
people from a company start down a
path with any of tbeir questions and
brainstorm until their ideas dry up.
Sometimes a given question will not
lead to any particular insight. That's
not a problem; tbe goal is to assemble an inventory of possible points
of differentiation. Once the ideas
are on the tahle, you can assess each
one and select those tbat are most
promising for your situation.
Blytb Industries, the candle manufacturer we mentioned earlier, provides a good example of how analyzing your customer's experience
works in practice. By exploring the
options raised by their analysis,
Blyth employees were ahle to take a
prosaic product tbat is easy to imitate and create a profitable competitive advantage. What is important to
understand here is tbat Blyth makes
no pretense of being able to create

places of worship. What quickly became evident to Blyth was that the
concerns and behavior patterns of its
customers were likely to be different
in each location. That insight suggested the potential for differentiation on the basis of location.
For example, consider how candles are used in the home. Virtually
every room in the bouse has potential: the dining room, living room,
kitchen, bedroom, batbroom, and
basement can all conceivably provide a setting for candle use, each for
a different reason.
Who? Who else is with the customer at any given link in tbe chain?
Do those other people bave any influence over tbe customer? Are their
thoughts or concerns important? If
you could arrange it, who else might
be with the customer? If you could
arrange it, how might those other
people influence the customer's decision to buy your product?

Because candles can have so many
uses, it isn't surprising that there are
as many potential places for their
use. Candles can be found at the

Is There a Way to Differentiate Selling Gas?
Consider the ''purchase link" of the consumption chain.

If you pursue tbe business-trip option,
the next question is,

Whom are they ^ t h when they
buy gasoline on a business trip?
Your customer could be alone or
occomponied by o colleague. He or she
could be with a spouse or significant
other. Your customer also could be
traveling with a group of people.

What else are your customers
doing when they buy gasoline?
Among other things, they might be
commuting, on a leisure trip, on a
business trip, on vacation, shopping, or
planning to use equipment [such as a
mower or a tiller).

If you pursue the idea that your custorm

special occasions. Each occasion
provides a distinct experience. Important for a candle maker, each also
triggers distinct emotions. Blyth employees were able to identify what
became several successful new areas
of differentiation by exploring how

Candles intended for use with family members at Thanksgiving, for example, might be scented with cinnamon, colored in tones associated

Because there are many holidays
and other occasions when families
get together in the dining room, you

process can be repeated for
as many different companions and settings as the
imagination of your employees can contemplate.

to differentiate its products for romantic meals. CEO Goergen has worked
hard to design scented candles in various shapes in order to influence the

They also came up with a variety of
