How Values Drive
Effectiveness
Landing a $2 million dollar contract is a big deal
in a company the size of Syncroness, a Denver-based engineering consulting firm. CEO
Mike Walraven was delighted when a new client
signed Syncroness to provide research for a
technology feasibility study.
“It was a fairly significant contract for us,” says
Walraven. This was exactly why the team was
disappointed to find – two weeks into a two year
contract – that the existing technology could not
do what the client wanted. “The physics were
such that it just couldn’t be done – it couldn’t be
scaled to fit the need,” says Walraven.
Now Walraven and his young company faced an
ethical decision: let the client know immediately and loose the $2 million dollar deal or drag
the project out in hopes of keeping some of the
contract’s money on the table.
Walraven made the ethical choice because it
aligned with the company’s values of creating
lasting relationships and leaving a legacy of
integrity. “I had to tell the client, ‘We’d just be
burning your money to continue this research.’”

but the client returned to Syncroness the next
time they had an engineering research need.
More importantly, word of Walraven’s honesty
with clients circulated in the industry, leading
to a stellar reputation and many new clients.
Syncroness’ story is just one of many we’ve
heard over the years: stories of leaders making
critical decisions guided by a strong set of core
values. There are no guarantees in business, but
this equation generally holds true:
Clear Leadership
+ Solid Strategy
+ Values-Driven Culture
= Sustainable Success

What is a Values-Driven
Culture?
Values-driven companies are guided by a
publicly-identified set of core values that reflect
their highest aspirations.

The tough choice paid off. It took a few years,
Making Values Meaningful | Page 2

<-----Page 2----->Typically these values include a commitment to honesty and integrity,
care for people, excellence in products and services, concern for all
stakeholders, a long-term view, and contribution to a flourishing society,
but the values need to fit with the company’s purpose and industry.
While the value of “safety” is central to DuPont, online shoe and clothing
retailer Zappos puts the focus on “Creating fun and a little weirdness.”
In strong, values-driven companies, these core values are consistently
used to guide day-to-day decision making, inspire leadership, and hold
the organization and its people accountable.

Why Does It Matter?
One word: success.

About this e-Book
This e-book is a resource for leaders
who want to leverage their corporate
values to drive sustainable success.
Think of this book as a “menu of options” that allows you to identify the
ideas that best fit your culture and
organization.
Along the way we share tools,
resources, and stories of companies
large and small who have successfully
built thriving values-driven cultures. We
prominently feature five companies on
which we have done extensive research
through our Return On Values Research
(ROV) Project in partnership with the
Small Giants Community. Those companies are:
•	 Amobee - a global digital marketing technology company (called
Adconion Direct at the time of our
research).
•	 BerylHealth - a Dallas-based health
care call center now owned by
Stericycle.
•	 Integrated Project Management a national project execution consulting firm.
•	 Service Express Incorporated a national data server maintenance
company.
•	 Tasty Catering - Chicagoland’s
leading business caterer.

Ethisphere shows similar results in their annual “World’s Most
Ethical Companies” list, which considers corporate citizenship;
governance; innovation for public well-being; industry leadership;
“tone from the top;” legal, regulatory and reputation track record; and
ethics and compliance programs. Collectively, these companies have
outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 7.3% annually.

How do values-driven companies like these
deliver superior results?
It boils down to four key factors:
1.	 Credibility and Trust – Integrated Project Management Company
(IPM), a project execution consulting firm based on Burr Ridge, IL,
has made the Inc. 5000 list as one of the fastest growing companies in
America for seven years running (2007-2013) and has been designated a “Top” or “Best” Small Workplace by Winning Workplaces,
the Wall Street Journal, the Great Place to Work Institute, Entrepreneur, and Fortune. Check out this video, in
which Founder and CEO Rich Panico explains the link
between IPM’s core values and business success: “Our
clients realize we’re honest, our repeat business is over 90%, and that
is driving top and bottom line growth.”
2.	 Committed and Engaged Team Members – Like IPM, BerylHealth,
the industry leader in outsourced contact center services, has consistently made the Inc. 5000, has received many “Best Workplaces”
awards, and regularly returns profit margins that exceed competitors three to four fold. In this video, Paul Spiegelman,
founder of BerylHealth and author of the best-selling
books Why is Everyone Smiling? and Patients Come
Second, uses the phrase “Circle of Growth” to describe
how investment in people leads to employee loyalty, which leads to
customer loyalty, and in turn leads to financial success.
Making Values Meaningful | Page 4

<-----Page 4----->3.	 Happy, High-Quality Customers – In their
book Conscious Capitalism, John Mackey
and Raj Sisodia argue that the number one
explanation for superior performance is
superior acceptance by customers. Great
companies are loved by their customers who
become ardent fans and advocates. As a result, these companies generate higher sales,
routinely outperform industry averages on
metrics such a sales per square foot and
revenue per team member, and can reinvest
earnings back into the company and still be
cost competitive. Like Paul, they claim it’s a
virtuous cycle: engaged team members attract high-quality customers, which in turn
drive top and bottom-line growth.
4.	 Resilience and Innovation – Leadership
expert Kim Cameron and his colleagues at
the University of Michigan (see references) have identified six core values (called

caring, compassionate support, forgiveness,
inspiration, meaning, and integrity. These
values build resilience by buffering against
the negative effects of poor relationships, hyper-change, and relentless competition. They
spark innovation by amplifying the positive

<-----Page 5----->CEO as Chief Culture Officer
The first and most important thing you can do
to create a values-driven organization is to make
values and culture a central task of leadership.
In his book Organizational Culture and Leadership, management guru Edgar Schein claims
that leaders are the main architects of culture.
Through their words and actions, leaders create,
embed, evolve, and sustain their company cultures. In turn, culture drives performance.
We all know this to be true. Employees are constantly watching senior leaders to see what they
say, what they do, where they invest their time
and energy, and what they support, promote,
and reward. People want to know, “Do my senior
leaders really walk the talk? And if they don’t,
why should I?”

How Values Can Transform a Leader
Tom Carmazzi, CEO of
Tuthill Corporation,
says he wasn’t always the likable guy
he is today.
“I was once told in a crowded
room that I did not care about
people,” Carmazzi says. “Another time someone offered the
gentler comment that I had ‘a
lot of energy.’”
The direct and sometimes confrontational side of Carmazzi’s
personality had at its source a
sense that relationships were
transactional: he entered each
interaction with the objective
of fulfilling his own agenda and
“getting things done” rather
than truly listening to the people around him.
This approach stood in direct
contrast to Tuthill’s values of

integrity, respect, excellence,
courage, responsibility, and
awareness. Carmazzi made
a conscious effort to change.
The results, he says, were
undeniable: more and more,
he receives positive feedback
regarding his modeling of the
company’s values.
“I now see my role as someone
who develops relationships
both inside and outside of Tuthill,” Carmazzi says. “These relationships are directly linked to
our Vision, Mission, Values, and
Brand statement which states
we want to ‘cultivate relationships that last for life.’”
Read the full story, in Carmazzi’s
own words, at www.cvdl.org/
Carmazzi.

Schein lists twelve things a leader does to build
culture. He calls the first six “primary embedding mechanisms” and the second six “secondary articulation and reinforcement mechanisms.”
We call them Culture Creators and Culture
Sustainers.

Culture Creators
1.	 What leaders pay attention to, measure, and
control;
2.	 How leaders react to critical incidents and
organizational crises;
3.	 How leaders allocate resources;
4.	 Deliberate role modeling, teaching, and
coaching;
5.	 How leaders allocate rewards and status;
6.	 How leaders recruit, hire, fire, and promote.

Culture Sustainers
1.	 Organizational design and structure;
2.	 Organizational systems and procedures;
3.	 Organizational rites and rituals;
4.	 Design of physical space and buildings;
5.	 Stories about important events and people;
6.	 Formal statements of organizational philosophy, creeds, and charters.
As a leader, the best way to make your values
meaningful is to invest time, money, energy,
and intellect into building a values-driven
culture. Senior leaders in the most successful
values-driven companies we’ve worked with see
themselves as “Chief Culture Officers,” no matter
what else is printed on their business cards.
They take primary responsibility to ensure that
Schein’s culture creators and culture sustainers
are alive and well throughout the organization:
•	

They actively participate in onboarding,

Making Values Meaningful | Page 6

<-----Page 6----->mentoring, training, and coaching;
•	

They apply resources, hire, fire, and promote
to support and reinforce the values;

•	

They are constantly telling stories and
recognizing people who put the values into
practice;

•	

They promote dialogue about the values in
senior team meetings, company-wide events,
and through all communication channels;

•	

They use the values to evaluate company
decisions big and small;

•	

They proudly post the values in their offices,
on their company
merchandise, and in visible public places;

•	
•	

They use the values to set strategy and build
customer relationships; and
They relentlessly make sure that the values
are integrated into every system and process
of the organization.

when the senior leadership team led the charge
to build a culture based on shared values of
commitment, collaboration, excellence, courage,
authenticity, and transparency, it generated more
respect, dialogue, alignment around vision and
direction, and resource sharing across the organization, which led in turn to increased performance and business results.
To see a great example of how one
CEO transformed his company’s
culture, check out this video featuring Tom Walter of Tasty Catering. In the video, Tom describes how he turned
the development of the culture over to a team
of employees who designed and implemented
a culture built around core values, audacious
goals, and a unifying purpose. Team members
began using the language of the values to guide
their decisions and shape interactions. As the
culture transformed Tasty Catering, Tom’s business cards were transformed too. They now read
Chief Culture Officer.

As Schein points out, when senior leaders
assume the role of “Chief Culture Officers,” it
pays off. In a recent study of a major healthcare
system in the Midwest, our colleagues Dr. Prem
Mony and Dr. Marie DiVirgilio discovered that

<-----Page 7----->Developing Clarity Around
Your Values
In business, it is easy to speak the same language
and still need a translator. The problem isn’t that
the words aren’t understood; it’s that the underlying meaning is missed.
Dr. Richard Boyatzis, a professor at
Case Western Reserve University
and author of Resonant Leadership,
shares a perfect illustration of this.
He tells the story of being in a classroom of
executives working on their MBAs. Two men in
the group, both leaders in their 40s, identified
“family values” as being important.
Boyatzis asked each what they meant by “family
values.” One man said it meant he was home
every night for dinner. He’d turned down a
promotion because it would have meant relocating his children. The other man said it meant he
worked long hours, traveling constantly, so his
wife and children had everything they wanted
and needed.
Two men, the same value, very different meanings.
Consider another example, an organization that
has “transparency” as one of its values. What
does it really mean to be transparent? Should
you be fully transparent with everyone, internally and externally, about everything all the
time, or are some people and topics off limits in
certain circumstances? Where do you draw the
line between good transparency and bad transparency, and what standards do you want to set
for yourself and your organization?

Getting Clear about Meaning

1. Ask the right questions, all the
time.
Job candidates at BerylHealth are asked to “Define compassion,” a value the company believes
is essential for successful employees. If the
candidate can’t express a clear understanding of
compassion, they won’t fit within the organization.
Clarifying questions around an organization’s
values aren’t helpful just in hiring. Imagine our
fictional company, Origami Carton & Crate, has
identified a competitor it may want to acquire,
but doing so will put a great burden on the existing team to work harder in the coming months.
This may challenge the core values of “respect”
and “excellence.” On one hand, the acquisition
will support respect and excellence by leading to
new organizational capacity, increasing profitability, and offering new advancement opportunities for OCC’s people. On the other hand,
it may stretch people too thin or risk damage to
existing relationships with clients, eroding both
respect and excellence.

ROV

ORIGAMI

Asking, “What does it mean for us to pursue
respect and excellence in this circumstance?”
will offer new insights, create alignment among
OCC’s people, strengthen the culture, and provide guidance on whether the acquisition is the
right thing to do.
On the following page, we introduce you to one
of the best exercises we know of for developing
clarity around core values, creating a map of
each values’ meaning.

How do you make sure that you and your colleagues are all on the same page when it comes
to core values? Here are two steps you can take:

Making Values Meaningful | Page 8

<-----Page 8----->ORIGAMI
carton
&crate

2. Map Your Meaning.
One of the clearest ways to make sure all team
members have the same understanding of your
core values is to “map” what you mean by them.
To get started, at a staff retreat or meeting, write
the name of one value in the center of a whiteboard or flip chart. Ask, “When we say TRANSPARENCY, what do we mean?” Surround the
value with the responses you receive.
As participants grow quiet, ask them to think
about their responses again from the perspective
of customers or clients, from the community,
from others within the organization. Ask them
to consider role-specific applications of the
value. For example, What does it mean to be
transparent with financials? How does that differ
from being transparent with strategic plans or
internal communications?
Whenever possible, ask people to elaborate on
their responses and write down key words or
phrases. Make special note of the language your
team members use to describe a specific value.
Pause to allow time for story-telling as an illus-

tration of the core values.
In the end, you’ll have a full white board of
meaning around the value, with little ambiguity.
Do this for each of your values. You and your
fellow leaders will walk away with a sense of
pride in your organization as well as a clear understanding of the shared meaning of the values
and guidelines for action.
Our fictional company, OCC,
might map their value of creativity
as you see above. In this example,
we’ve used our free Map Your
Meaning worksheet, which you can download at
www.cvdl.org/mapyourmeaning.
Note that OCC’s team members recorded
specific language for the value (“out of the box,”
“no one has done that before”); they’ve drawn
implications (“we reward ingenuity,” “it’s okay
to make mistakes”); and they’ve given thought
to how this value is shown in different organizational roles. The map creates clarity that in turn
can shape behavior.

Making Values Visual
Organizations that have a meaningful set of core
values aren’t satisfied with leaving them in a file
cabinet. Values-driven leaders use visual cues to
remind team members of the company’s values.
These visual cues are important: they help new
employees become familiar with the values and
understand them as a priority; they serve as a
reminder to consult the values when making
important decisions; they offer ongoing motivation to all team members.

Merchandise: Printed on the side of a coffee
mug or water bottle.

•	

Art: Symbolic depictions of the values –
such as the “Home Plate” from Sundog
Interactive (see photo next page), placed in
common areas.

•	

Signage: Printed value lists hung in break
rooms or other common areas.

At a minimum, your values list should be found
in these places:

•	

Posters: Tasteful illustrations of the values
for hanging in cubicles or elsewhere.

•	

Website: Usually under “About Our Company”

•	

Newsletter: Highlighted through stories in
print and electronic newsletters.

new hire contracts

•	

Videos: Include in training or internal
videos as in this video from BlinkUX.

•

documents

•	

Digital: Use on displays throughout your office, or as wallpaper on computer monitors.

Once you’ve integrated the values into these key
areas, you can begin to look for more creative
ways to help team members cross paths with the
values on a daily basis. Some ideas include:

Décor: Painted on an office wall or etched

the 100 best places

say the organization’s values are a
key factor in creating
an award-winning
workplace. The organization displays their
values on walls and
glass dividers throughout their offices.

Of course, it’s not enough to wallpaper your
HQ with the values. Moving them from a list to
a living, breathing organizational priority that
drives sustainable success takes deep integration.
On the following pages, we’ll discuss how this
can be done.

<-----Page 10----->Appreciative Inquiry

The Benefits of StrengthBased Change

Appreciative Inquiry, originated by David
Cooperrider and his colleagues at Case
Western Reserve University (see references),
allows people at every level to understand
what works – what gives life, health, and
vitality to their organization when it’s at its
best in both human and financial terms.
They then build on what works to identify
and implement new strategies for a successful and rewarding future.
Appreciative Inquiry can be done in many
ways at any level in an organization, but is
fundamentally based on two key questions:
•	 When our organization is at its best,
what are the forces and factors that
make it possible?
•	 Looking to the future, what are our
boldest dreams, and how can we
innovate and organize to make them
happen?
We provide a deeper explanation of Appreciative Inquiry in the section on values-driven strategy creation, on page 25, but you
will see this appreciative approach weaved
throughout this e-book in the stories we
tell, the activities we recommend, and the
research we cite to support our recommendations. We use it because it works better
than any other approach we know of.

One of the best, fastest, and most costeffective strategies for making your values
meaningful is to engage the entire organization in understanding and leveraging
your strengths. Strengths are a reflection
of what you value most and what enables
your company to succeed. At the Center for
Values-Driven Leadership, we help leaders
build values-driven, performance-focused
companies through a powerful strengthbased organizational change process known
as Appreciative Inquiry.

How One Company Makes Values their
Home Plate
Marketing and technology firm Sundog Interactive has doubled in size
in the last three years, earning a regular spot on the Inc. 5000. CEO
Brent Teiken gives credit for the company’s rapid expansion in part to
their strong, positive corporate culture which is grounded in six shared
values:
•	

Passion

•	

Integrity

•	

Creativity

•	

Quality

•	

Fun

•	

Innovation

Teiken takes personal responsibility for strengthening the culture. To
help keep the Sundog values front-and-center for team members, Sundog’s leaders use an analogy that makes immediate sense to most sports
fans: home plate.
“In baseball, home plate is where you start and where you go back to,”
Teiken says. “At Sundog, it’s the same with our values. They are where
we start, and where we always return.”
To serve as a reminder for the Sundog team, the company commissioned artist Kay Hilde to paint the values onto actual home plates,
which are displayed in conference rooms throughout the company.

<-----Page 11----->Communicating Values through
Executive Story-Telling
Story-telling is one of the greatest tools in a
leader’s toolbox. Stories illustrate what it looks
like to live out core values. Research shows that
we listen to and remember stories much better
than we do a list of bullet points or a deck of
PowerPoint slides.
Leaders looking to make values meaningful in
their company should become adept at seeing
how the values are at work in the people and
stories of the organization, and in retelling these
stories in a way that provides insight and inspiration to team members.
Integrated Project Management has
Honesty and Integrity as their first core
values. The leadership at IPM holds
these value dearly, letting them influence
daily practices. At speaking engagements, staff
meetings, new employee trainings, and virtually
everywhere he goes, CEO Rich Panico shares a
compelling story to illustrate IPM’s commitment
to honesty and integrity. (You can watch Rich
and colleagues tell this story in this video, which
we also shared earlier on page 4.)
As Rich shares, IPM’s contract states that clients
may not hire their IPM consultants. When one
consultant turned in her resignation with news
that she had been hired by a client, Rich knew it
was a violation of the company’s value of integrity. Rich negotiated with the client’s CEO to get
financial remuneration for the violation – mon-

ey that IPM quickly donated to local charities.
If you worked at IPM, imagine how your perspective of the organization would be influenced
after hearing that story. Would you have a better
idea of what IPM meant by honesty and integrity?
Would it influence your own decision making?
Would it make you proud to be a part of IPM?
Kim Reed Perell, formerly AdconROV ion Direct CEO, now president of
global digital marketing technology
company, Amobee, makes a point
of telling stories that illustrate the company’s
core value of resilience. Through Adconion
Direct’s employee newsletter, Kim regularly recognizes team members who have been “caught”
showing resilience. Kim’s stories and the public
recognition of values-driven behavior gives
clarity around the meaning of resilience, positively reinforces behavior, and serves as a much
appreciated (and low cost) reward.

speeches, one-on-one conversations, coaching

<-----Page 12----->Winning Hearts & Minds: The Battle for

Diversity & Inclusion Needs Authentic Leadership
(Here’s Where to Start)
by Kathy Hopinkah Hannan

Executive
Story-Telling

Kathy Hopinkah Hannan, KPMG’s National
Managing Partner for
Diversity, Inclusion
& Responsibility and
doctoral student in
the Center for Values-Driven Leadership’s executive Ph.D.
program, offers tips
for how to do executive story-telling well
in her article, Winning Hearts & Minds,
abridged from an earlier version published
on our website.
Hannan speaks to how
leaders can support
the value of diversity
through story-telling, but her advice is
broadly applicable for
other shared values.

As a diversity and inclusion executive, I’ve
watched many initiatives waver, stall, or at
worse, completely fail. What brings about these
downfalls isn’t strategy – the ideas are usually
sound.
So why aren’t more strong initiatives moving
forward? It’s because we’ve not yet won the
hearts and minds of many stakeholders. To
accelerate change, we need to move beyond
grasping the value propositions, articulating the
strategy, creating goals and metrics, defining
specific accountabilities, or developing corporate
slogans or vision statements. Though dialogue
and efforts have increased and we are beginning
to see progress, we will only be able to move
faster through Authentic Leadership.
Authentic Leadership can be defined in many
ways, but essentially it is a genuine approach to
leadership that connects actions to core values
and personal convictions. Leaders who do not
truly and deeply believe in the mission of the
initiative they are driving will never guide the
organization to full success. Leaders at all levels
must genuinely demonstrate, on a very personal level, why as an individual they personally
believe diversity to be important.

One Leader’s Story
Fortunately, I have seen the impact that this type
of leadership can have on an organization. One
example that comes to mind is that of a specific
white male CEO who spoke of his commitment
to diversity, his expectations of inclusion, and
even his establishment of bold goals for the
organization. But to the organization it appeared
to be rhetoric, another goal amongst many.
To fully win the hearts and minds of individuals
within the organization, the CEO shared a per-

sonal story that illustrated his own commitment
to diversity and inclusion.
The story was simple. He shared how he was the
youngest child and the only boy in a large family.
He spoke of being aware of the differences in
treatment between himself and his sisters. He
shared specific facts of the inequities he witnessed when his extremely capable older sisters
entered the workforce.
The CEO’s story became the catalyst for accelerating change within the organization, particularly with respect to the advancement of women.

“Leaders who do not truly and deeply
believe in the mission of the initiative
... will never guide the organization
to success.”
Individually we are all different, but collectively
our impact can be dynamic. You can apply the
principles of Authentic Leadership story-telling to your own diversity and inclusion work
through the following quick tips:

Tell a genuine story about how you have personally been impacted by diversity in your
own voice. Do not read from a script.

•	

Be sure you are deeply involved in the story
and not recalling observations from a
distance.

•	

Reveal some of the personal challenges encountered during your diversity journey.

•	

Ask for reactions or questions.

•	

Share your story often and with various
levels and audiences including external
constituents.

•	

Be engaged beyond the moment.

<-----Page 13----->Values as a Unifying Principle
In our research, we find examples again and
again of companies who use their values – and
sometimes, a single, overriding value – as a
guiding principle that shapes the strategic direction and cultural life of the company. Here is
one brief example:
Shortly after Andy Studdert arrived at NES
Rentals as their new CEO, an accident occurred
that could have seriously injured a mother and
child. In his previous role as the Chief Operating
Officer for United Airlines, Studdert had learned
to make safety a top priority.
As news of the accident came to him, Studdert
made an immediate decision to utilize this
potential tragedy as a way to further emphasize
his commitment to safety as the primary and
overriding corporate value. He shut the company down, asking every employee to return to
their home office and wait for a company-wide

conference call. On the call, Studdert told his
employees, “I’m tired of being lucky that we
haven’t killed anyone.” In a compelling speech,
he called for every employee to be retrained in
safety
precautions; no one was allowed to return to
the field until their training was complete.
Now, he says, “People say that was the defining
moment in changing the company.” Studdert
ends every employee conversation with ‘Be Safe.’
The single value has become the defining feature
of the company.

own words at

Which Values are Most Common?
Recently at the Center for Values-Driven Leadership, we conducted a study to identify the values held by companies
on the global Fortune 500 list. We found wide variety, but also a significant amount of overlap. In alphabetical order,
here are the values most commonly held:
•	 Accountability

•	 Reliability

•	 Commitment

•	 Respect

•	 Diversity

•	 Responsibility

While many companies use a single word to represent a core value, leading values-driven companies explain their values in much greater detail
in order to make them operational. For example, here are Whole Foods’
core values:

•	 Excellence

•	 Safety

•	 We Sell the Highest Quality Natural and Organic Products Available

•	 Honesty

•	 Service

•	 We Satisfy, Delight and Nourish Our Customers

•	 Innovation

•	 Social
Responsibility

•	 We Support Team Member Happiness and Excellence

•	 Integrity
•	 Leadership
•	 Loyalty
•	 Openness
•	 Partnership
•	 Passion
•	 Professionalism
•	 Quality

•	 Sustainability
•	 Team work
•	 Transparency
•	 Trust

•	 We Create Wealth Through Profits & Growth
•	 We Serve and Support Our Local and Global Communities
•	 We Practice and Advance Environmental Stewardship
•	 We Create Ongoing Win-Win Partnerships with Our Suppliers
•	 We Promote the Health of Our Stakeholders Through Healthy Eating
Education
On the Whole Foods website, each of these values has a one-sentence
description, and then you can click on a link to “learn more” about how
the value is operationalized. For additional ideas on how to develop
deeper meaning and understanding around values, see “Mapping Your
Values,” on page 9.

<-----Page 14----->Values-Driven People Practices
In a small business, the leader’s values are
virtually synonymous with the organization’s
values. But once a business has grown beyond
a few dozen employees, it becomes increasingly
important to create values-driven people
practices. Whether you lead an organization of
50 or 50,000, you’ll find many benefits in integrating your company values into your human
resources functions.
As a starting place, we recommend integrating
your values into the following people practices:
•	

Recruitment and Hiring

•	

Training and Development

•	

Performance Feedback

•	

Rewards and Recognitions

•	

When necessary, Firing

Recruitment & Hiring
In his book, Good to Great, Jim Collins popularized the idea of “getting the right people on the
bus.” For a values-driven company, this means
identifying job candidates who align with your
corporate values.
Earlier we introduced you to Integrated Project

Technology
as a Tool for
Sharing
Values

Management, where honesty is the first value.
CEO Rich Panico has a hard-earned reputation
of being deeply ethical, even when it requires
costly choices. Here’s how Rich connects the
company’s values to their hiring process:
So bringing the right people on board:
ROV people who have the talent, but most
importantly have the same values;
not similar values. We make that
very clear in our recruiting process when we’re
interviewing people. We are not looking for
someone who reasonably agrees with our values. I had one candidate who said, “I’m pretty
honest.” I said, “You’re pretty honest? When
are you not honest? You’re either honest all the
time or you’re implying that sometimes you
find reason not to be honest. We’re not looking for that. We’re looking for someone who is
honest all the time.”
For Rich and his leaders, getting the right people
on the bus begins with understanding the values
at play – and it starts in the interview process.
BerylHealth screens prospective employees with
a single question: Define compassion. Because
most employees at Beryl are in daily contact
with people facing health crises, the company’s leaders have determined that compassion
is the most important value a Beryl employee

Technology plays an important role in making values visible in companies with multiple offices, spread over large geographic territories. Southwire, a manufacturer of wire and cable with
locations across North America, is working to create a collaborative culture with five shared values, including “doing right,” which includes the respect and transparency team members show
toward one another.
To facilitate these values across diverse locations, Southwire CEO Stuart Thorn offers a “Just Ask”
question box on the company’s internal website, with a promise he’ll respond directly to any
employee-generated question. Southwire’s “iAm” online system gives team members at every
level a chance to receive coaching and feedback from anyone in the company. “Pulse Board”
digital displays at every site measure progress toward values-aligned goals. Southwire University
offers online training across the company.
“We use technology to create a sense of connectedness,” says Thorn. “You have to build mechanisms into the company.”
Making Values Meaningful | Page 15

<-----Page 15----->can hold. If the job candidate can’t explain what
compassion means to them, then the conversation is a non-starter.
If your company has a clear and
ORIGAMI
meaningful value set, consider how
carton
you can use these values as part
&crate
of the initial screening process for
applicants. At our fictional company, Origami Carton & Crate, they
might incorporate their values of Creativity,
Integrity, Respect, Sustainability and Excellence
with questions such as these:
•	

Think of a time when you found a creative
solution to address a problem, or when you
brought creative ideas to an existing process
or product. Tell the story. (Note that this
question is applicable for people in traditionally creative roles, such as graphic
design, but it works equally well for executives such as a CFO or COO.)

•	

At OCC, we value integrity. What does
integrity mean to you? In the past, how have
you handled circumstances where your
personal integrity, or the integrity of your
company, was challenged?

•	

What experience do you have in integrating
sustainability into the workplace? How and
why has this mattered to you? How have you
helped clients see the importance of
sustainability?

•	

We strive for excellence in all we do. Tell me
a story about a time when you didn’t settle
for good enough: what was the situation,
how did you push for excellence, and what
were the results? When is it okay to
compromise on excellence?

These questions are tailored to the unique value
set of our fictional company, but they can be
easily adapted for your company’s values. As
you adapt these questions – or create your own
– work to develop questions that help connect a
job candidate’s belief system with their professional experience, then look for alignment with
your organization’s core values. Often asking for
a story is the best way to truly see a candidate’s

commitment to the values. If the story lacks
detail, or is unconvincing in its focus, it may be
because the candidate doesn’t truly share your
perspectives.
This leads to an important next step in the Recruitment & Hiring process. Never hire a maybe.

Hire a Resounding “Yes”
If your values – and the culture they shape – are
the bedrock of your company, then you cannot
afford to hire someone who might fit. Many of
the executives we work with have told us what
happens when they hire a maybe. It’s a costly
mistake. Don’t cave to pressure to fill a role
quickly; hires who are a bad culture fit will leave
quickly, or (worse) stay too long and pull the
team around them down.
A human resources executive for one company
we’ve studied explained the final step of their
hiring process, which includes group interviews
with company leaders and colleagues. The ability
to give the team an opportunity to interview a
candidate helps confirm if a candidate aligns
with the company’s core values. If even one
interviewer gives the candidate a “maybe” vote,
the candidate is not hired. “We want everyone to
have a resounding yes,” the executive told us.

Training & Development
Once you’ve accomplished the first step of bringing values-aligned employees in the door, you
need to focus on helping new team members
understand your culture and values quickly and
in-depth. How this is done varies depending on
the size and nature of your organization and the
role of the new team member, but here are some
useful tools used by exemplary companies we’ve
studied:

For Leaders at All Levels

Onboarding: Strong values-driven companies
bring new hires together for multi-day onboarding sessions. The CEO and other senior leaders
actively participate in these meetings and lead
discussions on the company’s values and culture.
This can be done through:
Making Values Meaningful | Page 16

<-----Page 16----->•	

Story-telling to convey the organization’s
history, mission, vision, values, challenges
and successes. See page 12.

•	

Values mapping activities to establish clarity
around the meaning of the values. See exercise on page 9.

•	

Preprepared videos, such as the values video
from BlinkUX mentioned in our earlier
“Making Values Visual” section on page 10.

•	

Values interviews or facilitated conversations between new and existing team
members, where new hires collect stories of
the values in action. Stories can be recorded
with smartphones, and the videos played for
the training audience later in the day.

Mentoring: Mentoring is a crucial part of the
onboarding process and is a significant opportunity to reinforce the company values and help
new team members understand how to operationalize them on a day-to-day basis. Consider
creating a one-page summary sheet of your core
values that gets revisited each time a mentor and
mentee meet. Encourage mentors and mentees
to tell stories of the values in action. Have pairs
complete the values mapping exercise using the
Map Your Meaning worksheet found at www.
cvdl.org/mapyourmeaning. (See the Adconion
example on page 18.)
Values-in-action training: Develop training
modules that focus on putting values into
practice in key situations. For example, what
should you do if an important client asks you
to do something that violates your core value of
integrity? How should you handle it, what are
the proper channels, who do you turn to for support? Or what does it mean to treat people with
respect? How do you build strong relationships
while still maintaining appropriate boundaries?
How much should you go out of your way to
help others? How do you deal with legitimate
conflict around vision, direction, or allocation
of resources? A great resource for creating these
kinds of modules is Dr. Mary Gentile’s Giving
Voice to Values website, at Babson College. The
website provides dozens of cases, tools, and
resources for values-based training.

Incorporating in ongoing training: Work
with your training facilitators to integrate
values-based content into all formal training
sessions. Integration can be simple.
For example, imagine our fictional company
Origami Carton & Crate has planned a 2-day ORIGAMI
carton
software training session for its designers.
&crate
Early in the session, facilitators can remind
participants that the software is meant to
make work easier, freeing up more time for
fostering the value of creativity. Participants could
be encouraged to play around with the system in
the days immediately following the training, so
they develop mastery – a factor of excellence.
However your company chooses to do it, incorporating values into your training processes is an
important part of making them meaningful.

For Senior Leaders
In addition to the ideas above, executive leadership teams should give close consideration
to how senior leaders – especially those new to
their roles – should be taught values integration.
Dialogue with executive peers is an effective
means for training new senior leaders. Have
your new leader meet with each of her peers
during her first weeks on board. In these sessions, ask your officers to specifically address the
company’s values, sharing stories of how they’ve
shaped interactions, guided decision making,
and influenced the outcome of initiatives. This is
important for new leaders from outside the company, but is also vital for leaders who are rising
through the ranks: values integration becomes
more complex as responsibility grows.
Modeling is also important. Model values-driven leadership by incorporating the values into
executive team meetings. Reference the values
as you discuss concerns and strategies. Celebrate
examples of the values in action.
Provide visual reminders of the company’s values in your office suite with a plaque, trophies,
works of art, or a series of framed photographs
of employees putting the values into practice.
Consider including the values on the title sheet
of important documents, such as strategies and
forecasts.

Mentoring for
Values-Sharing
Mentoring plays an
important role in new employee
ROV training at Adconion Direct, now
Amobee. Through “The Buddy
Program,” new employees are
assigned a tenured team member to meet
with during their first months. When the
mentoring period ends, new team members
have a playful and public graduation ceremony which ends with posing for a picture
on a trampoline. The trampoline represents
Amobee’s core value of resilience and the
ability to “bounce back” from adversity. The
photos, displayed throughout the office, are a
regular reminder of the company’s values. Informal mentoring continues after graduation.
Buddies often end up developing personal
and professional friendships that last long
after the formal program has ended.

Performance Feedback
Effective performance feedback looks both at a
person’s job competencies and their alignment
with core values.
Making this connection can be as simple as
making time in performance feedback sessions
to revisit the same core values summary sheet
that is used as part of the mentoring process.
Another option is to include a set of questions
about values in your 360-reviews or other evaluation processes. For example, as part of a 360, a
colleague might be asked,
“On a scale of 1-5, to what extent does Tom
demonstrate the value of creativity in his work?
Please share specific examples and/or ways in
which Tom might develop in this area.”
This data can then be included in regular
(monthly or quarterly) performance feedback
meetings. One company we’ve worked with uses
a web-based tool and is developing an app that

employees can use to give one another real-time
feedback on their congruence with the values.
Making time for frequent feedback is important,
so there are no surprises during annual performance reviews, and so there is continuous company-wide alignment around core values.

Creating a Values Competency
Framework
Some companies go a step further and develop a
Values Competency Framework (VCF) to show
how individual values can be put into practice at
various levels of the organization. A VCF can incorporate the ideas and examples you identified
during your values mapping exercises.
On the following page you will find a simple
VCF for Origami Carton & Crate, focusing on
the value of creativity. A full VCF would have
similar components for each value.

This simple Values Competency Framework
illustrates how a series of level-appropriate
competencies can emerge from a single shared
value, Creativity. Developing your own VCF is
a significant undertaking that, to be done well,
requires input from every corner of the organization, often under the guidance of an external
consultant or project manager. However, you can
move in the direction of establishing a VCF just
by answering a series of questions:
•	

How should everyone in the organization
demonstrate the value of Creativity?

•	

How should leaders in the organization
demonstrate Creativity?

•	

What Creative skill sets are necessary for
executives in the organization?

Once established, you can begin to use these
values-driven competencies in your performance feedback processes, but only after you’ve
made the competencies public for an extended
period of time. It’s never a good idea to evaluate

someone on expectations you have not made
clear.

Rating Performance
With an established Values Competency Framework, you can rate team member performance
to help people understand how well they are
perceived to be living out the values. The decision to do this should be made with caution, and
only after you have fully developed your values
set and its competencies within the organization.
However, rating values-based performance can
also be a helpful tool in guiding the organization, because it helps team members understand
what it looks like to succeed within the organization. As the old adage goes, you manage to what
you measure. The following rating scale can be
considered:
1.	 Lagging: demonstrates a lack of familiarity
and intent toward the value and shows significant opportunity for growth in meeting
the competencies required.
Making Values Meaningful | Page 19

<-----Page 19----->2.	 Developing: demonstrates familiarity and
intent toward the value, but has opportunity for growth in meeting the competencies
required.
3.	 Proficient: regularly meets all or most of the
competencies required.
4.	 Excellent: consistently meets all of the competencies required.
5.	 Exemplary: meets all of the competencies required at their level, and shows capacity for
meeting competencies at the next level.
Having a clearly outlined VCF and a performance feedback system that identifies competency can also help you recognize areas in which
mentoring or training might help develop a high
potential employee within your organization.

Rewards & Recognition
A Native American legend tells the story of a
grandfather, discussing life with his granddaughter. “I feel as if I have two wolves warring in my
heart,” he tells her. “One is a good wolf, and the
other bad.” She asks him, “Which one wins?”
“The one I feed,” he tells her.
In life and in business, research shows that if you
positively “feed” the behavior you want you’ll get
more of it. Recognize and reward your team for
behaviors that reflect the values, and it will breed
more values-based behaviors.

Values-Based Recognition
We’ve come across dozens of companies who
actively reward values-driven behavior. Earlier
we shared the story of Adconion Direct’s eNews
shout-outs to employees caught living out the
value of resilience (see page 12). Here is another
compelling example:
PRIDE at Beryl is a program that celebrates team
members who are doing good work. PRIDE
stands for Peers Recognizing Individual Deeds
of Excellence. Beryl’s “Queen of Fun and Laughter,” Lana Morrow, explains:

“At any point in time an employee can go out to
our internet and … send a certificate of recognition to anyone else that is for something that
they did above and beyond their normal call
of duty. The catch though is they have to select
which one of our five core values that person
represented ...
Once they click submit it generates a whole
behind-the-scenes process where they eventually
receive their certificate and on that certificate is
a PRIDE Buck that’s worth five dollars.
Every month we select a really “wow” PRIDE
certificate that was received for each one of
those core values. And we give away a [prime]
parking lot spot for each one of our values.
We send out an email …
“Recognize and reward your team
sharing what they did,
for behaviors that reflect the values,
who recognized them
and it will breed more values-based
and how. Then quarbehavior.”
terly we do a drawing
for every single one of
the core values. If you received one during the
quarter then you go into that drawing and if your
name is drawn, then you get a $250 prize of your
choice.”
Beryl isn’t the only company publicly rewarding
values-based behavior. Lou Gerstner, the former
CEO of IBM who also held senior roles at American Express, offers this example of values recognition in an October 2014 McKinsey Quarterly:
“At American Express, we had an annual award
for people, all over the world, who delivered
great service. One winner I’ll never forget was
a young chauffeur whose car windscreen had
smashed and hit him in the head while he
was driving an American Express client to the
airport. Bleeding profusely, he continued the
journey and got the client to the plane on time.
By explicitly recognizing through worldwide
communications the incredible commitment of
people like this (and the rewards they receive),
you can get people to behave in a certain way.
Simply talking about it as part of your values
isn’t enough.”
Making Values Meaningful | Page 20

<-----Page 20----->Values-Based Promotions
Recognitions like this are important, but the
best way to really reward values-based behavior
is to promote your culture leaders. Advancing
team members who exemplify the values
ensures two things:
1.	 Others see the path to success requires living
out the values;
2.	 Leaders that get promoted to senior levels
are truly aligned with the organization’s
culture and know how to leverage the values
to drive success.

Firing
While hiring, training, and rewarding for values
can go a long way toward creating an effective
team, it is sometimes necessary to let someone
go. We cannot forget the BerylHealth executive
who gestured toward his colleagues. “Take a
look,” he said. “You won’t find any jerks here.”
He was confident of two things: 1) His company’s hiring process was good at finding people
who fit the company culture. 2) When they
missed something, they were good at quickly
moving that person out of the organization.
As advocates of values-driven organizational behavior, we encourage a robust dismissal process
that incorporates clear expectations, coaching,
and adequate time for personal development.
But when a team member has failed to live up
to these expectations, move them out of your
organization quickly. The opening line of a Wall
Street Journal article summarized it well: Superstars get a lot of attention from bosses. But bad
apples deserve even more.
For an exceptional example of how
to dismiss someone with dignity, see
this video on BerylHealth’s “decision
day” process. Beryl executives give the
employee a final day to provide a letter expressing
their intent to develop, or to leave and “part as
friends.” In some cases, the day sparks growth of
an employee’s cultural alignment. More often, it
gives employees a dignified opportunity to leave.

Values-Driven
Decision-Making
A company’s values can be a powerful source of unity when facing difficult decisions. Shinobu
Ishizuka, president of LA-based
Dyna-Search, which helps Japanese companies learn management
and leadership strategies from U.S. companies,
shares the story of one Japanese manufacturing
company that recently transitioned into their
third generation of leadership, a status worthy of
great respect in Japanese culture.
The grandson of the founder now runs the company, and discovered he had a unique problem:
because he was significantly younger than many
of the company’s managers, the managers did
not want to follow his leadership.
The CEO saw an opportunity to shape the
“We don’t make decisions based
culture. He began by
on what I say; we make them
establishing a dozen corbased on what the values say.”
porate values, and then
spent time working with
team members to ensure understanding of and
respect for the values. Now he tells his managers,
“We don’t make decisions based on what I say;
we make them based on what the values say.”
Like this Japanese executive, many leaders have
found core values make decision-making in your
organization easier and more consistent. But, at
times, there are also significant tensions between
values. For example, in our work with a leading
quick-service restaurant chain, we learned that
team members struggle to manage the tension between speed and quality. Speed drives short-term
revenue, but quality drives long-term reputation.
People were left wondering, “How should we prioritize the two when making decisions about our
global brand, strategies for growth, investment of
resources, and employee evaluations?”

Invite dialogue around the question. If the answer
is not easy, it may signal the need to find alternatives.

The Compass for DecisionMaking

In this grid, leaders plot where a particular decision falls in terms of the company’s values (is it
fully aligned with our values, partially aligned,
or not aligned?) and the company’s financial
position (is it a financial driver, an uncertain or
potential driver, or a financial drain?).

<-----Page 22----->Questions to Ask
As leaders work to identify a decision’s place on
the grid, new questions arise. Here are questions
to consider for each square on the grid:
Square 1: For the most part, decisions that land
in Square 1 are “no brainers” – they align with
your values and are strong financial drivers. Before you move forward, however, be sure to ask,
Is now the right time?
Square 2: Decisions in Square 2 align with your
values but have uncertain potential as a financial
driver. Ask, What should we further explore to
understand the financial implications? Is the
benefit we get from the values-aligned decision
worth a potential risk?
Square 3: Leaders are sometimes called upon to
make the right decision even though it’s costly.
These choices fall in Square 3. Is this the time for
that sort of choice? If so, evaluate carefully then
proceed.
Square 4: Decisions often land in Square 4 not
because they conflict with values, but because
they represent a potential challenge to the
values. Often this can still be a good decision as
long as values-driven safeguards are put in place.
Will a decision to take on a new project compromise the excellence you can deliver to existing
customers? How can you make it possible to be
excellent at both projects?
Square 5: Decisions that land in Square 5 also
indicate a potential challenge to values. These
challenges are worth overcoming if the project
can become more values-aligned and the potential financial value is worth the effort. If there’s
no long-term potential for values-alignment and
financial results, the decision does not need to
be considered further.
Square 6: Choices in Square 6 often help one
part of the company, with a neutral or negative
effect on other parts. Leaders should ask, How
can we help this choice align more fully with
who we are? How can we minimize cost or make
the choice profitable? If answers can’t be found,
avoid the choice.

Square 7: Avoid choices in this square, as they
represent true risk for your company.
Square 8: Like Square 7, this decision represents
a true risk for your company, and it has no payoff. Avoid choices in this square.
Square 9: Just as Square 1 was a “no brainer,” so
is Square 9. There is no reason to give further
consideration to choices that land in this square,
as it represents a compromise of the company’s
values and financial stability.
Let’s use the example from our fictional company, Origami Carton & Crate, of whether to
acquire a competitor. Acquiring the company
would extend OCC’s market share and add new
product lines. The cost would be high in the
short term, but it holds promise for significant
long term gain. Since the decision holds high
profit potential, but not immediately, we can
place its financial value on the grid somewhere
in the top two rows.

ORIGAMI
carton
&crate

When considering the values (Integrity, Respect,
Creativity, Excellence, Sustainability) in this acquisition, OCC’s leaders determine it will greatly
advance Creativity and will have a neutral effect
on Sustainability. The decision’s impact on the
values of Integrity, Respect, and Excellence are
harder to anticipate: purchasing the competitor
company could align well with these values, as
long as the leaders are able to behave with integrity and respect toward the employees of the
company they are purchasing, while also delivering excellence to their customers. We can place
its values-alignment on the grid somewhere in
the middle column.
With this in mind, OCC’s leaders can place the
decision in either Square 4 or Square 5 on the
Decision Making Grid. When choices fall in
these squares, leaders must address the challenges to the values (How can guarantee excellence
and integrity in this process?) while weighing
the long-term value (Can we afford this purchase? Will the pay-off merit the investment?).

Values-Driven Decision Making:
A Real-Life Example from
Zingerman’s Deli
Let’s look at a specific example. Zingerman’s
Deli and the Zingerman’s Community of
Businesses (ZCOB) in Ann Arbor, Michigan,
are local legends with a national reputation
– Oprah Winfrey and a host of other celebrities praise their specialty foods. ZCOB operates according to a triple bottom line they
call “great food, great service, great finance.”
And they do this without neglecting another component of traditional triple bottom
line approaches: the planet. This operating
mantra ties directly to their corporate values.
A few years ago, Zingerman’s was faced with
a choice. Their disposable soft drink cups
were costing the company up to $1800 a
month. The staff wanted to make the move
to washable cups that could be reused,
preventing landfill waste. The problem: each
reusable cup was more than $5 each. And
they needed thousands.
If we map this decision on the Compass for
Decision-Making, we see the reusable cups
align well with ZCOB’s concern for the environment, putting it in the right hand column.
The choice has high short-term costs, but
offers long-term savings, earning it a spot
in the middle row. Because ZCOB’s finances
were stable, they decided to go ahead with
the decision to buy reusable cups. The initial
expenditure would be costly but savings
would be seen eventually, and thousands
of pounds would be diverted from landfills.
Now that the transition has been made, the
company has recouped their initial expenditure, and saves nearly $1200 a month.
“We want to be as much ‘zero-waste’ as we
possibly can,” says Rodger Bowser, chef and
managing partner of the Zingerman’s Deli,
connecting the company’s shared values to
their financial strategy. It’s a business imperative, he says, because “the less product we
use, the more efficient we become.”

We’ve shared our Critical
Question and Compass for
Decision-Making. Here’s one
final tool for integrating your
values into the decision-making process. This
checklist will help insure that choices align
with your values. You can find a downloadable template of this checklist at www.cvdl.
org/decisionchecklist.
Keep a copy of the checklist in your boardroom, suggest team members hang the list on
cubicle walls, and place it in other communal
spaces where decisions are made.

Values-Driven
Decision Checklist
•	

We have considered the decision in light of each
corporate value, and confirmed there is significant alignment between the decision and the
values.

•	

We have considered the decision in light of all
stakeholders involved – employees, shareholders, customers, vendors, the public – with attention given to their interpretation of our values,
and their expectations for our company.

•	

We have allowed ample time and provided
adequate opportunity for those most impacted
by the decision to raise concerns or suggestions
about the decision’s alignment with our values.

•	

When we have identified a concern about the
decision’s alignment with a specific value, we
have identified strategies and assigned responsibility for safeguarding the value.

•	

We have a strategy for communicating our
decision and addressing potential concerns.

<-----Page 24----->Values-Driven Strategy
Creation
In his book, Good to Great, Jim Collins writes that
great companies have a firm understanding of
three key things – what they are deeply passionate
about (including core values and purpose); what
drives their economic engine; and what they can be
the best at in the world. To set and execute strategy,
they translate these understandings into a simple,
crystalline concept – called the Hedgehog Concept – and establish “Big Harry Audacious Goals”
(BHAGs) to guides their efforts.
Most of the successful values-driven companies
we know follow Collins’ formula to the letter.
They begin with a clear understanding of their
core values and purpose and then study what
drives their economic engine and what they
can be the best at in the world. They do this by
actively engaging people inside and outside the
organization in asking questions, debating ideas,

shaping strategy, and designing the organization
for execution, all led by senior leadership.
Appreciative Inquiry is the best approach we know
of for leading a strategy creation effort like this
because it is based on three powerful principles:
•	

Appreciation – understanding core values and
strengths past, present, and future

•	

Inquiry – systematic study of what works and
what’s possible in relationship to values and
strategy

•	

Wholeness – engagement of all stakeholders
for a fully-informed, values-driven strategic
perspective

Appreciative Inquiry also provides a clear fourstep process for execution called the “4-D model”
– Discovery, Dream, Design, and Deploy.

world’s leading pharmaceutical companies, let’s
call it PharmCo, align its Latin America growth

Expanding Access to Healthcare, and Teamwork.

The Latin America division has been recognized
as a leader in living out the values and in financial performance, and they wanted to build on
their track record by charting new values-driven
growth strategies for the future. Along with our
colleague, Diana Whitney, author of Appreciative
Leadership, we helped PharmCo Latin America
lead their stakeholders (employees, customers,
consumers and government officials) through an
Appreciative Inquiry process based on four core
questions:

4.	 Finally, if you could develop or transform
PharmCo Latin America’s growth strategy in
any way, what three wishes, in order of priority, would you make to elevate its overall
excellence and vitality?

1.	 Think of a time that PharmCo Latin American was at its best, a time that it was thriving
and growing in a way that was fully congruent with its values. What made it possible?

PharmCo and many other companies have
found that Appreciative Inquiry’s power for setting and executing values-driven strategy lies in
the questions it asks. Just like plants grow toward
the light, human systems grow in the direction
of the questions they ask. Ask negative questions
and you’ll receive negative answers. Ask positive, values-focused questions and you’ll receive
positive, values-focused answers. By incorporating positive, values-focused questions into your
strategy sessions you’ll move in a direction that
is aligned with your values and strategic to your
overall objectives.

2.	 Imagine that tonight you fall into a deep
relaxing sleep, and you don’t wake up for
10 years. When you awake, you are in your
home country and you see that many small
and large miracles have occurred, and the
world has changed in ways you would most
like to see it—for yourself, for children, for
grandchildren, for nature, etc. You go out
into the world and get a panoramic view.
You are happy with what you see. It’s the
kind of world you most want to be part of.
What has changed in society, education,
health, people, nature, technologies, economy, arts, spirit, community? What do you
see in your vision of a better world?
3.	 Now, more specifically, what do you see in
your vision about PharmCo Latin America?
How is PharmCo Latin America helping
to create the world you envisioned? What’s
happening at PharmCo Latin America that
is new and different and better? How is your

As a result of the process, PharmCo Latin America strengthened its relationships with customers, consumers, government officials, and other
stakeholders and charted a bold new strategy for
growth.

Chicago’s Elkay Manufacturing has “be in
business forever” as their first value. CEO Tim
Jahnke mentions this value regularly, and it
guides his decision-making and strategy-setting. Challenging times arose in 2008 when the
housing market began to plummet. Focusing on
the company’s value of being in business forever
helped clarify strategies that ensured the company’s survival. Hear the story in Jahnke’s words,
in this short video, www.cvdl.org/Jahnke.

Relationships
As leaders and their companies progress in the
integration of their values, it moves from being
an internal tool for strategy and relationship, to
an external tool that strengthens partnerships
and builds long-term positive reputations.
Strong values-driven companies often experience exceptional customer loyalty. Our colleagues Dr. Mike Manning and Dr. Basil Chen,

says most client legal departments remove the
expectations, but IPM commits to meeting the
standards anyway.
Clients of IPM may not notice the values in their
contracts, but they certainly see it in each interaction with IPM consultants. Clients and customers
will notice how your engaged and values-driven
employees live out your corporate values.
Firms like IPM work closely with a relatively
small number of clients. How do you make your
values public if your company works with hundreds, thousands, or even millions of customers
daily?
We’ve seen values statements show up in unlikely places, such as printed on a child’s fast food
meal bag, or on receipts for purchases. If you’ve
ordered shoes from Zappos, you may have
received an email like the one below. Each email
highlights a different Zappos core value.

Often your clients and customers will notice
your corporate values in action in unfortunate
circumstances. Chicagoland’s Tasty Catering
holds, among others, the value of “high customer
service standards” and “quality in everything we
do.” Employees are empowered to right any situation where the values aren’t being met.
Tasty Catering CEO Tom Walter, author of It’s
My Company Too, recalls a time when this was
tested. A young shift leader was in charge of
catering service for an important client’s summer
picnic. A variety of mistakes occurred – orders
missed, white wine at room temperature – and
the shift leader knew the event hadn’t met Tasty’s
values. She offered the client a refund on a
significant portion of their bill.
“You can’t do that,” the client told her.
“Yes I can,” she said, citing Tasty’s core values.
She reached Tom by phone and he quickly
backed her decision, assuring the client that they
wouldn’t be charged for the mistakes.
Despite receiving imperfect service, Tasty Catering’s values-driven approach to making it right
built customer loyalty, says Tom.
Of course, your values can “show up” to
customers and clients, without ever using the
word “values.” The printed inside of Tasty’s lunch
boxes (above) are an example of this: though

the word “values” doesn’t appear, Tasty makes
it clear you can anticipate all Tasty employees from their chefs to their drivers - will emulate
the values of “quality in everything we do,” “high
customer service standards,” and “a competitive
and strong determination to be the best.”

Nagano Chuo Taxi earned its reputation for exceptional care during the 1998 Winter Olympics
in Japan when, instead of going after the lucrative business of tourists, Chuo decided to maintain and even grow their service to the elderly
and infirm of Nagano. They gave up short-term
profit, but got exceptional customer loyalty and
long-term growth in return.
While most taxi companies might see their purpose is to get customers from Point A to Point
B, Chuo’s mission statement includes the charge
to “protect the dignity of people.” They do this
through warm greetings, intentionally opening
the door for clients, and offering an umbrella
service on rainy days. They are small acts of
great significance for Chuo’s elderly and disabled clientele. As one regular customer wrote
to the Chuo leadership, “You give me courage
to live, and it only costs me five dollars.”
Reception from customers has been warm, but
Chuo has also found the strategy has financial
advantages. Their company is nearly twice as
profitable as competitors.

<-----Page 28----->Scaling Values from 300 to 16,000
Occasionally executives are skeptical about the
ability to deeply align values in a large company.
To close this e-book, we’d like to share the story
of one senior leader who is doing just that. The
story begins in a small company 20 years ago, and
offers a “how to” on shifting the culture of a large
company to be more values-aligned:
BerylHealth, a healthcare call center, had its
start with three employees and the phone line in
a backroom. Between 1985 and 2012, founder
and CEO Paul Spiegelman grew the company to
300 employees. The company earned multiple
Inc. 500 and Best Places to Work awards for its
impressive growth trajectory and strong, positive
values-driven culture that was built first on truly
caring for employees.
Paul entertained purchase offers over the years,
but turned them all down until 2012 when Stericycle offered him an opportunity other potential buyers hadn’t: a chance to build corporate
culture at a much larger scale. Paul was named
Stericycle’s new Chief Culture Officer.

help customers fulfill their promise by providing solutions that protect people and brands,
promote health and safeguard the environment),
which became a banner to rally around.
One leader suggested using a handprint (see
below) to aid in remembering Stericycle’s core
values.
Paul and his team directed the initial efforts to
focus on four key areas:
1.	 Communication;
2.	 What it looks like to live the vision and
values;
3.	 Training and development;
4.	 Rewards and recognition.

Measuring the Value of Culture
Stericycle’s new Chief Culture Officer called on
his colleagues in the executive suite to set the

Now he was faced with a new challenge of
accomplishing in a company of 16,000 what he’d
made possible in a company of 300.

How to Shift a Culture
Paul began by assembling 40 leaders from
across the globe to talk about values. Together,
they landed on the company’s core purpose (to

This image and others in this section courtesy of Stericycle.

Stericycle’s 25 year history is one of steady
growth. They’ve met or exceeded their earnings
projections every quarter for the last 70 quarters. While Stericycle’s culture was positive, with
very loyal employees, recently appointed CEO
Charlie Alutto believed culture and values could
be used to advance the company and to bring
together the various divisions and geographic
locations. Paul and Charlie felt it was a blankslate opportunity.

Making Values Meaningful | Page 29

<-----Page 29----->metrics that would be used to measure success.
“If they’ve set the metrics, they can’t downplay
the results,” he says. He also worked with an
internal financial analyst to quantify costs, such
as employee attrition, so that the financial value
of culture could be readily seen by organizational leaders.
In the end, Stericycle determined to measure
culture in a variety of ways, including:
•	

An annual engagement survey;

•	

The amount and cost of team member attrition (if culture-changes can reduce attrition
by 10 percent, it will save Stericycle $4 to $5
million annually);

•	

Customer loyalty;

•	

Engagement and profitability by site;

•	

Participation in wellness and other benefit
programs.

With areas of focus and metrics in place, Paul’s
team borrowed ideas from the BerylHealth playbook to create strategies for spreading the culture
across the organization. Below are just a few
programs that are helping to shape Stericycle’s
new values-driven approach to culture:

The Core Values Toolkit is a
12-page operating manual that
helps Stericycle leaders and
managers understand how to
align the company’s core values
with their daily responsibilities.

SteriStories is an intentional
effort to collect stories of Stericycle employees “living out the
values.” These stories are then
used in newsletters, and other
channels like SteriTV (below).

Each Stericycle business unit
has a Culture Ambassador who
acts as the local champion for
the company’s culture and core
values.

Quarterly townhalls at rotating
locations feature Paul, along
with the CEO and other executives, sharing stories of values
in action.

SteriTV is a quarterly news
show produced by Stericycle
team members. The show highlights news within the organization, with a focus on values and
culture.

Through SteriCares, the organization invests in their local
community and provides hardship support for team members, reflecting the core values.

100 existing and future leaders
come together annually for the
Leadership Summit, to build
relationships and focus on
culture and values training.

SteriCore platform, viewable
on smartphones or home
computers, recognizes and encourages employees, many of
whom don’t have work email
accounts.

With operations in dozens of
countries, Stericycle relies on
their new Steri University to
provide training - including a
focus on values.

Stericycle’s purpose is to
promote health, including the
health of employees. SteriWell
provides education, resources,
and gym memberships.
