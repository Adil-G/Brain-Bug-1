<-----Page 0----->ESTIMATION OF A CHANGE POINT IN MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS
Jushan Bai*
Abstract —This paper studies the least squares estimation of a change
point in multiple regressions. Consistency, rate of convergence, and
asymptotic distributions are obtained. The model allows for lagged
dependent variables and trending regressors. The error process can be
dependent and heteroskedastic. For nonstationary regressors or disturbances, the asymptotic distribution is shown to be skewed. The analytical
density function and the cumulative distribution function for the general
skewed distribution are derived. The analysis applies to both pure and
partial changes. The method is used to analyze the response of market
interest rates to discount rate changes.

Introduction

P

ARAMETER instability for economic models is a
common phenomenon. This is particularly true for
time-series data covering an extended period, as it is more
likely for the underlying data-generating mechanism to be
disturbed over a longer horizon by various factors such as
policy-regime shift. For example, for the empirical problem
examined in this paper, we find that the response pattern of
interest rates to the changes in discount rates varies over
time. The timing of variation is consistent with the timing of
changes in the Fed’s operating procedures. It is well known
that failure to take into account parameter changes, given
their presence, may lead to incorrect policy implications and
predictions. On the other hand, proper treatment of parameter changes can be useful in uncovering the underlying
factors that fostered the changes, in identifying misspecification, and in analyzing the effect of a policy change. The
purpose of this paper is to study the parameter-change
problem in multiple regressions with an unknown change
point. The main concern is the estimation of the change
point as well as the statistical theory of the change-point
estimator. We derive some useful results under fairly general
conditions.
For independent and identically distributed observations
up to a parameter shift, there is a well-developed theory
under maximum-likelihood estimation (see Hinkley (1970),
Bhattacharya (1987), and Yao (1987)). For a mean shift in
linear processes estimated with the least-squares method, the
theory is also worked out (see Bai (1994) and Antoch et al.
(1996)). For multiple regression models, the change-point
problem is also studied widely. Yet most of the existing work
focuses on testing rather than estimation (e.g., Kim and
Siegmund (1989) and Gombay and Horváth (1994)). A
number of authors investigated the consistency property for
the estimated change point, but the rate of convergence is not
obtained. These include Krishnaiah and Miao (1988), Hor-

váth (1994), and Nunes et al. and Newbold (1995), among
others. Consistency is not enough for deriving the asymptotic distribution. The rate of convergence is needed for this
purpose.
In this paper we develop the asymptotic theory for the
estimated change point in multiple regressions. These include consistency, rate of convergence, and asymptotic
distribution. While we improve the existing consistency
result by deriving the rate of convergence, the conditions
required are much weaker than those in the existing literature. Our model allows for lagged dependent variables and
trending regressors. Furthermore, the disturbances can be
heterogeneous and dependent over time. In particular, we
assume the disturbances form a sequence of mixingale,
which include strong mixing, linear processes, and other
dependent structures as special cases, as shown by Hall and
Heyde (1980) and Andrews (1988). In addition, the rate of
convergence is obtained for both fixed magnitude of shift
and shrinking magnitude of shift. As for the asymptotic
distribution, we show that it is skewed except for stationary
or asymptotically stationary regressors and disturbances. We
also derive the analytical density function and cumulative
distribution function for the skewed distribution. These are
not studied by the existing literature.
Furthermore, the problem is considered in the context of
partial change, in which some of the regression parameters
hold constant throughout the sample. These parameters are
estimated using the entire sample in order to gain efficiency.
When all parameters are allowed to change, a pure structural
change model is obtained. Therefore a partial structural
change amounts to imposing parameter restrictions across
regimes. Advantages of a partial change model include more
efficient estimation of the regression parameters and better
conservation of degrees of freedom. The latter is important
for a regression problem with a limited number of observations but many regressors, which is typical for many
economic applications.
As an application, we study the relationship between
changes in market interest rates and changes in discount rate.
This relationship is found to be unstable over time. It
appears that changes in the Fed’s operating procedures
during the period of October 1979–October 1982 alter the
response pattern. Through this application, we describe in
detail the procedure for implementing the theoretical result.
In particular, we discuss how to tackle the problem of
multiple breaks for empirical problems in a sequential way,
and how to construct confidence intervals.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
specifies the model and the underlying assumptions. Consistency, rate of convergence, and asymptotic distribution are
derived in this section. Construction of confidence intervals
is considered. Section III studies the response pattern
of market interest rates to changes in the discount rate.

Theoretical Result

A. Model and Assumptions

Consider the following linear regression with a change
point at k0:
yt 5 w8a
t 1 z8d
t 1 1 et,

t 5 1, 2, . . . , k0

yt 5 w8a
t 1 z8d
t 2 1 et,

t 5 k0 1 1, . . . , T

(1)

where yt is an observation on the dependent variable, wt and
zt are vectors of regressors, and et is an unobservable
disturbance. The vectors a, d1, and d2 are unknown parameters. We assume d1 Þ d2, so that a change has taken place.
The change point k0 is unknown. Our purpose is to estimate
these parameters. The analysis is based on a reparameterization. Let xt 5 (w8,t z t8)8, b 5 (a8, d18)8, and d 5 d2 2 d1. Then
equations (1) can be rewritten as
yt 5 x8b
t 1 et,

t 5 1, 2, . . . , k0

yt 5 x8b
t 1 z8d
t 1 et,

t 5 k0 1 1, . . . , T.

(2)

Now zt is a subvector of xt and d Þ 0. More generally, let zt 5
R8xt, where R is a p 3 q known matrix with full column
rank. This defines zt as a linear transformation of xt. For R 5
(0, I )8, with I an identity matrix, a partial change like
equations (1) is obtained. For R 5 I, a pure change model is
obtained.
To present the model in a matrix format, further notation
is necessary. Let Y 5 ( y1, . . . , yT )8, X 5 (x1, x2, . . . , x T )8,
e 5 (e1, e2, . . . , eT )8, X1 5 (x1, x2, . . . , x k, 0, . . . , 0)8, X2 5
(0, . . . , 0, xk11, . . . , x T )8, and X0 5 (0, . . . , 0, xk011,
. . . , xT )8. The matrices X1 and X2 depend on k, but this
dependence will not be displayed for notational simplicity.
Define Z1, Z2, and Z0 in a similar way (i.e., replace xt by zt ).
Then Z1 5 X1R, Z2 5 X2R, and Z0 5 X0R. Equations (2) can
then be rewritten as
Y 5 Xb 1 Z0d 1 e.

(3)

The least-squares method is used to estimate the model.
Let ST (k) denote the sum of squared residuals when regressing Y on X and Z2. The change point k̂ is defined as
k̂ 5 arg min ST (k).

In practice, the existence of a break may not be known. A

estimator of (b, d) by regressing Y on X and Z2. Let S denote
the sum of squared residuals by regressing Y on X alone.
From the identity S 2 S(k) 5 d̂k (Z 28MZ 2 )d̂k (see Amemiya
(1985, pp. 31–33)), we see that the Wald test statistic is a

That is, the estimator obtained by minimizing the sum of
squared residuals is the same as maximizing Wald-type
statistics. These statistics are used in Andrews (1993) and
others for testing the existence of a change point. Christiano
(1992) uses these statistics for estimating potential changes
in U.S. gross national product (GNP). It is useful to note
that, for empirical applications, a break point estimator is
obtained automatically when the null hypothesis is rejected,
combining the testing and estimation in a single step.1

denotes the minimum eigenvalue for each of the above
matrices. For simplicity, we assume these matrices are
invertible when j $ p. In addition, these four matrices have

example, supj$1 \(1/j)Sjt51 xt x8\
t is stochastically bounded.
A4: (X 8X/T ) converges in probability to a nonrandom

1 While hypothesis testing requires that k [ [Tp, T(1 2 p)] for small
p . 0, the estimation theory does not require this restriction, provided that
a change point is assumed to exist. In practice, the existence of a break may
not be known a priori. If the existence is determined via a test, such a
restriction is implicitly imposed for empirical work.

for the definition of L 2 mixingales and Andrews (1988) for
general L r mixingales. In addition, Sj j 11dcj , ` for some d . 0

Assumption A1 assumes that the shift point is bounded
away from the end points, which is used for asymptotic
purpose. Assumption A2 allows for trending regressors
written in the form (t/T )l, l . 0, or, more generally, written
as any function of the time trend g(t/T ). Expressing them in
this format avoids a scaling matrix that would otherwise be
required when deriving limiting distributions. This format is
also required by assumptions A3 and A4 because no scaling
matrix is used in these two assumptions. A3 requires that
there be enough data around the change point and at the
beginning and at the end of the sample, so that the change
point can be identified. The latter half of A3 is typically
implied by the strong law of large numbers for the sequence
of 5xt x86.
t Assumptions A4 and A5 are standard for linear
regressions, and they are used for the central limit theorem.
Assumption A6a allows for lagged dependent regressors
(e.g., autoregressive models); A6b allows for general serial
correlation in the disturbances. A6 together with A4 and A5
imply the strong law of large numbers for xtet, because
conditions in Hansen (1991) are satisfied. These conditions
are sufficient to obtain the rate of convergence for the
estimated break point. Note that no stationarity for regressors or disturbances is required for consistency.

Op (\dT \ 22 ).
Similar results are obtained for identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) models up to a shift, as in Yao
(1987) and Bhattacharya (1987). Bai (1994) derives this
result for a mean shift in linear processes and Picard (1985)
for a Gaussian autoregressive model. To the author’s knowledge, proposition 1 is the first result for multiple regression
models.2 Furthermore, the conditions required in this paper
are far less restrictive than those in the existing literature.
This rate of convergence holds for models with lagged
dependent variables, so that the autoregressive model is a
special case. Our result holds for trending regressors. We
also allow for dependent and heterogeneous disturbances.
The disturbances can be a sequence of mixingales, thus
including linear processes and strong mixing processes as
special cases. Under much stronger assumptions, Horváth
(1994) proves the consistency of t̂ 5 k̂/T, but without
obtaining the rate of convergence. Proposition 1 implies that
T a (t̂ 2 t) converges to zero in probability for any a , 1 for
dT fixed. In a recent work, Nunes et al. (1995) also prove
consistency for the estimated break fraction, but without rate
of convergence. A fixed magnitude of shift is considered by
these authors.
Let b̂ 5 b̂(k̂) and d̂ 5 d̂(k̂) be the estimators of b and d
corresponding to k̂. That is, we replace Z0 by Z2 with k 5 k̂
and then estimate model (3). We have

B. Consistency

We shall establish the consistency and the rate of convergence for the change-point estimator. The rate of convergence not only describes how fast the estimator converges to
the true value, it is also necessary in order to derive the
limiting distribution. As will be explained later, it is useful to
consider asymptotic distributions under shrinking magnitude of shift such that d depends on T with dT = 0. Thus we
will need the rate of convergence for shrinking shifts.
Apparently the magnitude of shift cannot be too small,
otherwise it will be impossible to identify the change point.

Notice that â and b̂ have the same limiting distributions as if

a mean shift in linear processes.
C. Asymptotic Distribution

We consider two frameworks of asymptotic distribution.
One is based on the fixed magnitude of a shift, the other on a
shrinking magnitude of shift. We first consider the case of a
fixed shift. To obtain the limiting distribution, additional
assumptions are necessary. Assume
`
is strictly stationary.

We define a stochastic process W *(m) on the set of

zero as the sample size grows unbounded. The result is that
the limiting distribution is invariant to the underlying
distribution of zt and et. The resulting distribution can be
used as an approximation even for large shifts. This idea can
be found in Bhattacharya (1987), Picard (1985), and Yao
(1987) for various special models. This framework is
extended here to general regression models. Moreover, we
allow nonstationary regressors and disturbances. In this
case, the limiting distribution turns out to be nonsymmetric.
We derive the analytical density function and the cumulative
distribution function (cdf ) for this general limiting distribution, so that confidence intervals can be constructed. To this
end, we amend assumption A7 to
A78: dT 5 d0vT, where vT is a positive number such that
vT = 0 and T (1/2)2avT = ` for some a [ (0, 21) and d0 Þ 0.
This amendment makes the asymptotic argument easier.

The above limiting distribution can be extended to
nonstationary data. For simplicity, assume 5zt, et 6 are i.i.d.
(z (1), e(1) ) for t # k0 and 5zt, et 6 are i.i.d. (z (2), e(2) ) for t . k0 in
model (2). Then the limiting distribution still holds if one
regards (zi, ei ) in equation (8) as i.i.d. (z (1), e(1) ) and (zi, ei ) in
equation (9) as i.i.d. (z (2), e(2) ).
To derive the probability function of the limiting distribution, one must know d and the distribution of 5zt, et 6. Hinkley
(1970) studied the case for zt 5 1 and et i.i.d. normal.
Analytical solutions for general cases are typically difficult
to obtain. An alternative asymptotic theory is to consider
small shifts, assuming the magnitude of shifts converges to

D. Confidence Intervals

The results derived above allow easy construction of
confidence intervals for the change point. All that is needed
is to construct consistent estimates for Qi, Vi, s2i , i 5 1, 2,
and dT. We discuss various special cases below.
1. (zt, et) is second-order stationary for the whole sample. In this case, the limiting distribution is characterized
by equation (13) or equation (14). For serially uncorrelated
disturbances, we only need estimates for dT, Q, and s2. An
estimate for dT is already available; Q and s2 are estimated

[k̂ 2 [c/L̂] 2 1, k̂ 1 [c/L̂] 1 1]

(17)

where c is the (1 2 a/2)th quantile of the random variable
arg max 5W(s) 2 0s0/26; [c/L̂ ] is the integer part of c/L̂. The
quantile c can be computed from the cdf formula (B.4) in
appendix B. For example, for a 5 0.1, c 5 7.0 and for a 5
0.5, c 5 11.0.
For serially correlated disturbances we need an estimate
for V, which can be obtained by the method of Newey and
West (1987). Define L̂ 5 (d̂T8Q̂d̂T )2/(d̂T8V̂d̂T ). The confidence
interval is again given by equation (17) with this new L̂.
2. (zt, et ) is stationary within each regime. In this case,
the limiting distribution is described by equation (12). The
quantities to be estimated are Qi, Vi, i 5 1, 2, and dT. We
ˆ
T
estimate Q1 by k̂ 21Skt51 ztz 8,t and Q2 by (T 2 k̂)21St5kˆ 11 ztz8.
t
The Vi are estimated by the Newey and West method, but
V1 is computed using the subsample [1, k̂] and V 2 using
the subsample [k̂ 1 1, T ]. For serially uncorrelated et,
ˆ
Vi 5 s2i Qi; s21 is estimated by k̂ 21Skt51ê2t and s22 by
T
(T 2 k̂)21St5kˆ 11 ê2t . Once these quantities are obtained, we
can estimate j and f in equation (10) by the plug-in method.
Note that d0 can be replaced by d̂T in estimating j and f.

FIGURE 1.—CHANGES IN DISCOUNT AND INTEREST RATES (DOTTED VERTICAL
LINES—DISCOUNT-RATE CHANGES; SOLID CURVE—INTEREST-RATE CHANGES)

Empirical Result

In this section we analyze the response of market interest
rates to the changes in the discount rates. The discount rate is
the rate at which the Fed lends and is set by the Fed. It has
been noted by many researchers that discount-rate changes
of the same size can have different effects on market interest
rates (see Dueker (1992) and the references therein). The
differentials in the response may reflect different causes that
prompted the Fed to change the discount rates or reflect the
conditions of the economy. Here we model the response of
market interest rates to discount-rate changes by a simple
linear model and examine the response pattern over time. As
an additional purpose, this application illustrates the procedures for implementing the theoretical results.
A. The Data

Data used in this analysis can be found in Dueker (1992).
The yields of three-month T-bills are used as the market
interest rates. The range of data spans 1973 to 1989. Over
this period, there were 56 changes in the discount rate made
by the Fed. An observation is obtained every time there is a
change in the discount rate. A change in interest rate is
calculated as the closing T-bill rate on the day of a
discount-rate change, minus the closing T-bill rate the day
before the change. Thus the data are in daily level (frequency). Because discount rates are changed irregularly, the
observations are not equally spaced in calendar time.
Changes in the discount rate are plotted in figure 1 along
with changes in interest rates. The vertical dotted lines
represent the size and direction of the discount-rate changes.
The solid line represents the changes in interest rate.

on market interest rates. It is possible that an increase in the
discount rate has a different impact on interest rates from a
decrease, if the direction of discount-rate changes carries
economic or financial information. Therefore we suggest a
modified response model,
1

DTBi 5 a 1 bDDR i 1 gDDR 2
i 1 ei

(20)

where DDR 1 5 max 50, DDR 6 and DDR 2 5 DDR 1 2
DDR . When this model is fitted to the data, the adjusted R 2
shows a marked improvement over equation (19). Also, the
hypothesis of equal coefficients for DDR 1 and DDR 2 is
easily rejected. Both models are to be examined. The first
will be referred to as the symmetric response model, and the
second as the asymmetric response model. We will compare
the estimation results. In particular, we examine how the
estimated change points are affected by model specification.

B. The Model

The following simple linear regression is used to describe
the response relationship:
DTBi 5 a 1 bDDRi 1 ei

(19)

where DDRi denotes the change in the discount rate for the
ith observation, DTBi denotes the change in the market
interest rate, and ei is a stochastic disturbance. Because the
data have daily frequency and two adjacent observations are
generally far apart over time, it is reasonable to assume that
the ei are uncorrelated over time. In particular, under the
efficient-market hypothesis, ei will be a sequence of martingale differences. In this case, equation (19) describes the
market’s reaction to the ‘‘news’’ of the Fed’s discount-rate
changes. This model is similar in spirit to the one used by
Roley and Wheatley (1990) in their study of interest-rate
response to the money announcement surprises. The appropriateness of this model is further discussed in the comment
section below.
The above simple linear relationship assumes that a
change in the discount rate of the same size in absolute value
(regardless of an increase or a decrease) has the same effect

C. Estimation Procedure

For empirical problems, more than one break may exist,
as evidenced by the empirical application here. We discuss a
procedure capable of detecting and locating multiple breaks.
The procedure is based on hypothesis testing and works as
follows. Starting from the whole sample, perform a parameter constancy test. If the test rejects the null hypothesis,
then estimate a break point and divide the sample into two
subsamples at the estimated break point. Perform a parameter constancy test for each subsample. Estimate an additional break whenever the subsample fails the constancy
test. Divide the subsample at the estimated break point (if
any) into nested subsamples and do the same analysis. This
step is repeated until all the subsamples do not reject the null
hypothesis. If the number of break points is known a priori,
then no hypothesis testing is necessary. In this case, one just
estimates the break points sequentially in the ordering for
which the sum of squared residuals is reduced the most, until
the specified number of breaks is obtained. This is discussed
in Bai and Perron (1994). Analogously, if it is known that the
number of breaks is at least m, then no testing is necessary
for the first m break points.

<-----Page 6----->CHANGE POINT ESTIMATION IN MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS

When all of the break points are obtained, a refinement is
needed. An estimated change point should be reestimated if
it is obtained from a sample or subsample containing more
than one break. This reestimation procedure is called
refinement. Suppose there are only two breaks and they are
identified as k̂1 and k̂2, k̂1 , k̂2. If k̂1 is identified in the first
place (i.e., from the whole sample), then k̂1 should be
reestimated using the subsample [1, k̂2 ]. Similarly, if k̂2 is
identified in advance of k̂1, then the second break should be
reestimated using the subsample [k̂1, T ]. Each refined estimator has the same asymptotic distribution as if the sample had
a single break point, so that our asymptotic theory can be
applied, as asserted by Bai (1995b). This procedure was first
suggested in an earlier version of this paper. A refinement
may be performed prior to the complete estimation of all of
the breaks.
It is important to note that the Wald statistic is designed
for a single break point; it has less power when multiple
breaks exist. This is because ŝ2 (k) in equation (4) is not a
consistent estimator of s2 and is biased upward in the
presence of multiple breaks. Although for large samples (or
for a large magnitude of shift) one will reject the null
hypothesis regardless of the consistency3 of ŝ2 (k), the lack
of power may not be negligible for small or moderate
samples. Fortunately, the problem can be overcome by a
simple modification of the test statistic.4 In constructing the
test statistic (4), the residual variance in the denominator is
estimated by allowing for more than one break. For moderate sample sizes, two or three breaks should be good enough
in adjusting the denominator of equation (4). In our empirical application, this adjustment is made for the full sample
test. Critical values of the hypothesis testing are obtained
assuming 15% precent ‘‘trimming’’ and 10% significance
level. The size of a test should be large for small samples, as
we choose here. The critical values are 10.01 for q 5 2 and
12.27 for q 5 3. Here q denotes the number of coefficients
that are allowed to change (see Andrews (1993)).
D. Test and Estimation Results

Symmetric Response Model: When the whole sample is
tested for parameter constancy, the sup-Wald statistic is
8.05, occurring at October 9, 1979 (k 5 28). The test does
not show instability compared with the critical value of
10.01. However, if we proceed to divide the sample into two
subsamples at the estimated break date and test for parameter constancy for each subsample, we will find that the
second subsample has a sup-Wald statistic of 15.20, occurring at December 4, 1981 (k 5 38). This indicates the
existence of a break. In addition, if we use the subsample
[1, 37] to test parameter constancy, the sup-Wald is 58.15,
3 Because S 2 S (k) converges to infinity as the sample size increases
T
and §ˆ 2 (k) is stochastically bounded, it follows that the Wald test statistic
becomes arbitrarily large as the sample size grows.
4 When the null hypothesis can be rejected without this modification, it
will imply a stronger evidence of instability.

557

achieved at October 9, 1979 (k 5 28), strongly rejecting the
null. Moreover, when the subsample [38, 56] is used, we
uncover another break point at August 27, 1982 (k 5 42)
with sup-Wald 11.44. Further tests for each resulting subsample do not show instability. Our analysis indeed indicates
the existence of multiple breaks. The failure to uncover any
break with the full sample proves the lack of power for the
sup-Wald test in the face of multiple breaks. As a verification, if we use the adjustment mentioned earlier by estimating the variance using residuals based on two breaks (at
observations 28 and 38), the sup-Wald statistic for the whole
sample becomes 11.96, thereby rejecting the null.
The final model has three breaks, occurring at the dates
October 9, 1979, December 4, 1981, and August 27, 1982.
(In terms of observation numbers, they are 28, 38, and 42,
respectively.) Because the middle break is estimated with the
subsample [28, 56], a refinement is obtained by reestimating
the middle break with the subsample [28, 41]. When this is
performed, the same break point is obtained, but the
sup-Wald becomes 33.00. The other two breaks are refined
already. These estimates are summarized in table 1. The first
break point marks the beginning of the Fed’s October
1979–October 1982 operating procedure changes. The last
break is near the end of the Fed’s procedure changes. It
remains an open question as to what economic activity
induces the second break. The estimated regression coefficients are reported in table 2.
Asymmetric Response Model: The adjusted sup-Wald
statistic for the full sample is 13.56, rejecting the null
hypothesis5 (the critical value is 12.27 for q 5 3). The
maximum is again achieved on October 9, 1979 (k 5 28).
For the subsample [1, 27], the sup-Wald statistic is 9.23,
which is not significant compared with the critical value of
12.26. For the subsample [28, 56], only two of the three
coefficients (the intercept and DDR 1 ) are allowed to change,
because of the lack of variation in the data. The sup-Wald
statistic is 10.001, which is just shy of significance compared with the critical value of 10.01 (note that q 5 2). The
maximum is attained on August 27, 1982 (k 5 42). This date
will be treated as a break point for an additional reason
besides the closeness of the test statistic to the critical value.
When the subsample [1, 41] is used to refine the first break,
the sup-Wald statistic is 37.07, more than triple the value
computed for the full sample (see footnote 5). This is a sign
of multiple breaks. The refined break point is on September
19, 1979 (k 5 27).
Further hypothesis testing for each resulting subsample
does not reveal additional breaks. In particular, the middle
break point (k 5 38) associated with the symmetric response
model does not show up here. The sup-Wald statistic for the
subsample [28, 41] is only 6.55, as opposed to 33.00 under
the symmetric response model. Thus the middle break point
identified in the first model is accounted for by the asymmetric response. In summary, two break points are identified.
5 The adjustment assumes two breaks in estimating the variance. Without
this adjustment, the sup-Wald statistic for the full sample is 10.25.

These two breaks correspond to the October 1979–October

are reported in table 3. The estimated regression coefficients
for the final model are provided in table 4. The middle
regime exhibits a higher response to discount-rate changes,
particularly to discount-rate increases.
E. Confidence Intervals

Symmetric Response Model: For this model, three breaks
are identified, at the dates of October 9, 1979, December 4,
1981, and August 27, 1982. (The observation numbers are
28, 38, and 42, respectively.) We first consider constructing
confidence intervals using the symmetric limiting distribution (derived assuming homogeneous data). Those using the
skewed limiting distribution are given later. The first break is
estimated with the subsample [1, 37]. From table 2 we see
that d̂ 5 (20.403, 20.171)8. For zt 5 (1, DDRt )8, the

limiting distribution is 11.0, obtained from equation (B.4).
By equation (17), the upper boundary of the 95% confidence
interval will be 28 1 [11.0/7.95] 1 1 5 30. By symmetry,
the confidence interval is [26, 30]. The second break is
estimated with the sample [28, 41] with d̂ 5 (1.028, 0.373)8.

Thus the upper boundary of the confidence interval is 38 1
[11.0/24.35] 1 1 5 39. Again by symmetry, the confidence
interval is [37, 39]. Using the same method, the confidence
interval for the third break point is found to be [39, 45].
These results are reported in table 1. Confidence intervals in
calendar time are provided in table 5. The first two breaks
are estimated with more precision, the last one has a larger
interval.
In the above construction it is assumed that the two
neighboring regimes surrounding each break have homogeneous data. By visual inspection of figure 1 we see that this
is not the case. For example, the magnitude of the regressors
for the second regime, October 79–August 89, is typically
twice the magnitude for the first regime. This suggests that
Q1 is not equal to Q2. Thus Q1 and Q2 should be estimated
separately. In addition, the disturbances may not have
common variance cross regimes, thus confidence intervals
based on a skewed limiting distribution might be more
appropriate. For the first break point, we estimate Q1 by

j 5 1.08. The ratio s22/s21 is estimated by s 22/s 21, yielding
2.556. Thus the estimated f is (s2/s1 )2ĵ 5 2.771. Using
equations (B.2) and (B.3) for j 5 1.085 and f 5 2.771, the
97.5% quantile is 28.0, the 2.5% quantile is 29.2. The scale
factor L 5 d8Q1d/s21 is estimated to be 10.72. From equation
(18), the lower boundary of the interval is 28 2 [28/10.72]
2 1 5 25. The upper boundary is 28 2 [9.2/10.72] 1 1 5
29. Thus an asymmetric 95% confidence interval is [25, 29].
Using the same method, the confidence interval for the
second break is [37, 39], and for the third break it is [39, 44].
The skewed confidence intervals are similar to the symmetric ones, except that the first is wider.
Asymmetric Response Model: For this model, two break
points are identified, the first is September 19, 1979, and the
second is August 27, 1982. (The observation numbers are 27
and 42, respectively.) Assuming homogeneous data, the
confidence interval for the first break is found to be [25, 29],

Some Comments

1. Changes in the interest rates may be affected by many
other variables, such as money growth, unemployment, and
industrial production. These macroeconomic variables are
relatively smooth (lower frequency data) compared with the
daily interest rates. We believe that these variables are
reflected more in the level of the interest rates than in the
changes. Changes in the daily interest rates may be treated as
white noise in the absence of ‘‘news’’ under the efficient
market hypothesis. On the day that the discount rate is
altered, the change in the interest rate consists of two
components: a response to a change in the discount rate, and
an idiosyncratic variation, at least in the absence of other
‘‘news.’’ This is the rationale for considering models (19)
and (20). Nevertheless, the condition of the economy may
affect the strength of a response. One might argue, for
example, that high unemployment spurs a stronger reaction.

If this is the case, then an interactive term of DDRt and the
unemployment rate may be added as a separate explanatory
variable. In this case, the simple model (19) amounts to an
omitted-variable specification. However, one aspect of the
structural change method is (or can be viewed as) identifying misspecification. Our result shows that the misspecification is due, perhaps, more to the omission of the Fed’s policy
as a variable than to the lack of inclusion of other macroeconomic variables.
2. We point out that observation 42 (August 27, 1982) is
unusual. The discount rate was cut down by a half-point,
whereas the market interest rate rose by 0.7 point. Three cuts
were made in the month of August, each by a half-point.
This is the only month in which the Fed changed the
discount rate so frequently. The market reacted strongly to
the first two cuts. Even though the timing of discount-rate
changes is generally not easily predicted (see Dueker
(1992)), the third cut seems to have been anticipated by the
market. The day before the cut, the market interest rate was
the lowest of that week.
When a dummy variable is made to account for this
observation, the result is not altered much for either the
symmetric or the asymmetric response models. The number

and for the second it is [38, 46]. For nonhomogeneous data,
the confidence intervals are found to be [22, 28] and
[38, 47], respectively. These intervals are given in table 3.

of breaks and their locations are the same, except that the last
break is identified at observation 44 (November 22, 1982)
rather than at 42. This change is not dramatic and is not
unexpected, because observation 42 is the boundary of a
regime in the absence of this dummy. Tests and estimation
results for this case are not reported here.
3. The 1979 and 1982 breaks are identified under both the
symmetric and the asymmetric response models, suggesting
a stronger evidence in supporting these two breaks. The
1981 break appears only under the symmetric response,
illustrating the sensitivity of break point estimation to model
specification. The asymmetric response model appears to be
a reasonable one. In the absence of breaks, the asymmetric
model fits the data better in terms of the adjusted R 2. The
regression coefficients of DDR 1 and DDR 2 are significantly
different. With breaks, direct comparison of R 2 is not
appropriate, as regression equations cover different time
periods. An asymmetric response model will be meaningful
if the sign of the discount-rate changes provides information
about the Fed’s monetary policy objectives. At any rate, the
hypothesis of asymmetric response deserves further examination in future research.

Conclusion

We have studied the change-point problem in multiple
regressions where some or all of the coefficients have a shift
occurring at an unknown time. Consistency and the limiting
distribution are established for the change-point estimator
computed by the least-squares method. The results are
obtained under very general conditions. In particular our
results hold for a wide range of regressors such as deterministic and stochastic regressors, lagged dependent variables,
and time trend. Dependent and heteroskedastic disturbances
are allowed. We derived a skewed and parameter-embedded
analytical density function and a cumulative distribution
function for the asymptotic distribution of the change-point
estimator. The result includes the symmetric distribution in
the prior literature as a special case and is useful for
constructing confidence intervals for the true break. The
empirical analysis examined the relationship between the
interest-rate responses to the changes in the discount rate.
This response pattern is found to be unstable. The instability
seems to be caused by the Fed’s change in operating
procedures during the period of October 1979–October
1982. In addition, we documented the asymmetry in the
response pattern. The regression result suggests a larger
response to an increase in the discount rate than to a
decrease.

Note that A(k) is symmetric and is positive definite when X D8XD is

by A3 and A4. In addition, the minimum eigenvalue of [1/(k0 2 k)]X D8XD is

X D8XD ]21 \ is bounded with large probability for all large k0 2 k. Thus
\ A(k)21 \ is bounded with large probability for all large k0 2 k. This implies
that the minimum eigenvalue of A(k) is bounded away from zero for all
large k0 2 k. This is also true for R8A(k)R because R has full common rank.

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS

Summarizing these results yields expression (A.9). The proof of proposition 1 is complete.
Proof of Corollary 1: Let Ẑ0 denote Z0 when k0 is replaced by k̂. Then
the estimators b̂ and d̂ are obtained by regressing Y on X and Ẑ0. The true
model can be rewritten as Y 5 Xb 1 Ẑ0d 1 e* with e* 5 e 1 (Z0 2 Ẑ0 )d.

Proof of Proposition 2
For k , k0,

All we have to show is that the limit of the right-hand side is the same as
the limit when Ẑ0 is replaced by Z0. Let us show plim (1/ÎT )X 8 (Z0 2 Ẑ0 )

equation (A.11), Op (1), which stands for expression (A.2), can be easily
shown to be op (1) uniformly on D(C). Combining these results together
with equations (A.4) and (A.11), we obtain the lemma.

Proof of Proposition 3

All other entries are handled similarly. The normality follows from the
central limit theorem.
Proposition 1 implies that k̂ will not lie in K(C) for large C with large
probability. Let D(C) denote the complement set of K(C) such that
D(C) 5 5k: 0 k 2 k0 0 # C \ dT \ 22 6. To study the limiting distribution, we
study the behavior of VT (k) on D(C).

Under strict stationarity, the above has the same distribution as W1 (k 2 k0 )

z e , which has the same distribution as
2d8(St5k

W2 (k 2 k0 ). Thus lemma A.5 implies that VT (k) 2 VT (k0 ) converges in
distribution to W*(k 2 k0 ) and the convergence is uniform on any given
bounded set of integers around k0. Now the process W*(m) has a unique
maximum with probability 1 when (d8zt )2 1 2d8ztet has a continuous
distribution, because P(W*(m) 5 W*(m8)) 5 0 for m Þ m8. Let m* 5
arg maxm W*(m), then m* is Op (1) because W*(m) = 2` with probability
tending to 1 as 0 m 0 = `. We thus have that for every e . 0, there exists
K , ` such that P( 0 m* 0 . K) , e. Similarly by proposition 1, P( 0 k̂ 2
k0 0 . K) , e. Let k̂K 5 arg max0k2k0 0#K VT (k) and mK* 5 arg max0m0#K
W*(m). The uniform convergence of VT (k) 2 VT (k0 ) to W*(k 2 k0 ) on any
bounded set of integers (the difference 0 k 2 k0 0 is bounded) implies that
d
k̂K 2 k0 = mK*. That is, for large T, 0 P(k̂K 2 k 0 5 j) 2 P(mK* 5 j) 0 , e for
all 0 j 0 # K. However, if 0 k̂ 2 k0 0 # K, then k̂ 5 k̂K and if 0 m* 0 # K, then m*
5 mK*. Thus the difference 0 P(k̂ 2 k 0 5 j) 2 P(m* 5 j) 0 is bounded by
0 P(k̂K 2 k 0 5 j) 2 P(mK* 5 j) 0 1 P( 0 k̂ 2 k0 0 . K) 1 P( 0 m* 0 . K) , 3e.
Since e can be arbitrarily small and K can be arbitrary large, the
proposition is proved.

Density Function of arg maxv Z(v) (see equation (11))
Recall that the process Z(v) involves two independent Brownian
motions with different scales (f Þ 1) and two different drifts j Þ 1. To
obtain the density function of l* 5 arg maxv Z(v), we use the argument of
Bhattacharya and Brockwell (1976), who considered the case in which the
two Brownian motions have the same scale. In addition to the density
function, we also derive the cdf of l*, which is useful for obtaining
quantiles when constructing confidence intervals. Let m be the maximum
and l the location of the maximum of X(t) 5 lB(t) 2 ut/2, t $ 0, where
B(t) is a standard Brownian motion process on [0, `). That is, l 5
arg maxt X(t) and m 5 maxt X(t). Using the result of Bhattacharya and
Brockwell (1976) with a scale transformation, we obtain the joint density
of (l, m) as

The marginal distribution of m is exponential with mean l2/u. Now let
(l1, m1 ) be the location and the maximum of 5W1 (2v) 2 0 v 0 /26, v , 0. The
joint density of (l1, m1 ) is f1 ( 0 x 0 , y), where f1 is the same as equation (B.1)
with u 5 l 5 1. Let (l2, m2 ) be the location and the maximum of
5Îf )W2 (v) 2 jv /26, v . 0, with joint density f2 (x, y) (given by equation
(B.1) with l 5 Îf and u 5 j). Because (l1, m1 ) is independent of (l2, m2 ),
the joint density of (l1, m1, l2, m2 ) is f1 ( 0 x 0 , y) f2 (x8, y8). Let l* 5 arg
maxv Z(v). Then l* 5 l1 if m1 . m2 and l* 5 l2 if m1 , m2. Thus the density
