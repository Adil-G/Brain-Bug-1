Abstract It has been recognised that there is importance of trust within organisations. There is
also a recognised theme that trust must move beyond rational or calculative trust to various forms
of social trust. This paper makes clear the potential importance of social trust, and its value to
emerging organisations. In the new era of faster, looser, more rapidly changing connections
between people and groups, trust based on inferences about the motives, character and intentions
of others is becoming more central to the ability of organisations to manage their dynamics
efficiently and effectively and ensure their growth and survival.

It is clear that in the last several years issues of trust have become increasingly
central to the study of organisations. For someone who participated in early
efforts to draw attention to the importance of trust (Kramer and Tyler, 1996),
this growing centrality is exciting. The emerging role of trust makes sense
given that trust is a perfect focus for those interested in the dynamics of
organisations because trust sits at the boundary of psychology and sociology.
For this reason, the study of trust has become important in political science,
policy studies, law, organisational psychology, organisational behaviour and
behavioural economics. In this paper I want to address several key questions
that have emerged as central to the study of trust.
The first question is why trust has emerged as such an important issue in
the study of organisations. I believe that trust is important because of the
strong desire to understand how to create effective co-operation within
organisations. Trust is a key because it enables co-operation. While
co-operation has always been important in organisations, new trends in the
nature of organisational dynamics have had to consequences. First, they have
led to changes in the nature of work that make old styles of securing
co-operation increasingly difficult to maintain. Second, they have changed the
nature of the co-operation that is needed by organisations, putting greater
emphasis on more voluntary forms of co-operation which are more difficult to
motivate.
Old models of management focused on command and control strategies of
motivation. These strategies encouraged authorities to direct the activities of
people in the organisation using surveillance linked to incentives and
sanctions. This model has been labelled the deterrence model in law,
“command and control” in management, “low trust” forms of governance in
sociology and rational choice in economics. These strategies allow authorities
to secure one type and level of co-operation. However, the world is changing,

<-----Page 1----->and organisations increasingly need a new type of co-operation from their
members.
These are several ways in which the world is changing. First, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to implement command and control styles of management
effectively. More and more people work in widely dispersed groups, with
increases in the number of people who work at home; who work with varying
schedules; and who work in different branches of multinational companies.
In addition, the multilevel hierarchies that have facilitated traditional
command and control are increasingly being flattened. It is more and more
likely that people will be working in teams of equals, without a designated
leader whose responsibility is to monitor and respond to the behaviour of
others. Instead, responsibilities are shared across group members, and
“leadership” may be different for varying tasks. In addition, judgements about
pay and promotion are made more collaboratively, and involve discussion and
consensus building.
In addition, traditional social control mechanisms are being lost. One
important source of social control are the informal networks of family and
friends that embed people in their social groups. The web of extended families
and long-term work associates is becoming weaker, since people are more
separate from others, and do not view their relationships as necessarily
enduring over time. This is partially true because people are more mobile, and
often move away from family and friends.
These is also a greater willingness to break ties with others, with job
turnover becoming more frequent. On many levels, people feel freer to break
social ties and change long-term social arrangements. For example, people
increasingly think of their relationship with their employer as contingent and
changeable when opportunities arise. Instead of expecting to work for one
company throughout their career, people anticipate shifting companies and
even careers. They are less loyal to any one employer. This is not the only such
contingent arrangement – as heightened divorce rates make clear. But, it is a
salient one and one with consequences for trust.
This trend is connected to the general alienation and disengagement of
people from social institutions – church, government – that leads to declining
deference to authority (Lipset and Schneider, 1983). This judgement that
people’s engagement in society is declining has led to a recent focus on the need
for “civic engagement” in neighborhoods, communities and society (Putnam,
1995). Civic engagement can take a variety of forms, ranging from voting to
cleaning up one’s sidewalk.
Finally, within work organisations the nature of work itself is changing in
ways that make command and control approaches to motivation increasingly
difficult. Work is increasingly centred around intellectual labour, rather than
simple and repetitive tasks. Intellectual labour is difficult to monitor and
depends heavily on willing engagement in work. We must trust that people are

making an effort to work well, since it is harder to monitor their behaviour. In
work organisations, this shift in focus has led to increasing attention to
extra-role behaviour – the voluntary behaviours that people perform in work
settings (Tyler and Blader, 2000).
To understand these changes, we need a typology of the types of
co-operative behaviour that are desired in organisations. Such a typology is
presented in Table I. It highlights the importance of voluntary co-operation,
both in terms of following rules and in terms of performing desirable
behaviours. While both types of behaviour can be motivated by incentives and
sanctions, the voluntary forms of these behaviours are especially valuable to
organisations. That value comes because people are internally motivated to
engage in these behaviours.
Internal motivations facilitate co-operation in organisations because the
organisation does not need to create rules and authorities whose task is to
monitor and react to people’s behaviour. Further, the organisation does not
need to use its resources to provide incentives for desirable behaviour nor to
create and maintain a credible system of deterrence. Instead, people act
co-operatively because they are motivated to do so for personal reasons. For
these reasons, internally motivated co-operation is a value-added for
organisations.
To the degree that the members of organisations are internally motivated to
engage in actions that aid the group, management needs to make efforts to
ensure that such actions occur. In addition, people can more effectively manage
their own behaviour, bringing it into line with rules and policies irrespective of
whether leaders are present and paying attention to the actions of their
followers. The desire of followers to follow rules and help the group is a more
reliable way to secure desirable co-operation than is the provision of incentives
or sanctions.
Social motives
The increasing importance of internally motivated behaviour to organisations
makes clear why issues of trust and procedural justice are becoming more
central to organisational studies. Both trust and procedural justice are social
motives, i.e. motives that are internal or socially generated. They flow from
within the person, rather than being linked to incentives or sanctions. There is
already a large literature on procedural justice (Lind and Tyler, 1988; Tyler
et al., 1997; Tyler and Smith, 1997), while the literature on trust is rapidly
expanding (Kramer and Tyler, 1996; Kramer, 1999).

<-----Page 3----->What is trust?
From my perspective one interesting issue is what the nature of trust can best
be characterised as being. In addressing the issue of trust many researchers
have immediately adopted an instrumental or rational choice approach to trust.
For example, they have viewed trust as an issue of predictability in which
people behave based on their expectations concerning the likely future
behaviour of others. Trust can also be treated as an issue of competence, with
people trusting those that they believe can solve problems and deliver desired
outcomes.
I think that this view of trust is inadequate to deal with the issues of trust
that are confronted by organisations. A good example of those issues is
reflected in the idea of fiduciary trust. This is the type of trust that people have
for a doctor or a lawyer or an accountant. What is striking about situations of
fiduciary trust is that, because people are relying on someone with specialised
training and knowledge, they lack the expertise and information to understand
their actions. So, their ability to anticipate the actions of others is very low.
When the ability to predict is low, there must be some other basis for trust if
co-operation is to occur (Tyler and Huo, 2002).
To address this question I want to distinguish instrumental trust from what
I will refer to as social trust. Social trust is not based on judgements about the
predictability or competence of others. Instead it is based on attributions about
the motives of others. People infer whether they trust that others have the
intention to do what is good for them, whether they are motivated to be ethical
and fair. With a doctor, for example, I cannot evaluate his or her competence,
but I can make an inference about whether they are sincerely trying to do what
is in my best interest.
This distinction between instrumental and social trust parallels a key
distinction within the literature on procedural justice. In that literature the
fairness of procedures is distinguished from instrumental judgements about
the favourability or fairness of one’s outcomes. As in the case of trust, we
become interested in procedural fairness judgements primarily when we find
that they have a distinct influence on reactions to experience beyond the
influence of outcome-based judgements. As with the literature on trust, studies
suggest that outcome-based judgements are inadequate to explain people’s
reactions to their experiences. There is typically an addition,
non-outcome-based, element to reactions. This element is linked to
judgements about the fairness of the procedures involved. Hence, procedural
justice can also be viewed as a social motive.
In both cases the potential value-added for social motives lies in their ability
to encourage levels of co-operation beyond those than can be sustained by
instrumental motivations. If we only trust those people whose behaviour we
can effectively predict, for example, we will have trouble benefiting from the
expertise of others. Trusting those that we think have well-intentioned

motivations extends our willingness to co-operate with others. As noted, the
needs of organisations encourage such trust-based co-operation.
Procedural justice and motive-based trust
Given that there are two social motives – procedural justice and motive-based
trust – we can ask how these two motives are distinguished. In particular,
since there is already a large literature on procedural justice, what is gained by
adding studies of motive-based trust to this mix.
Addressing this question involves addressing several issues. First, whether
motive-based trust is important. Second, whether motive-based trust has an
impact that is distinct from the impact of procedural justice. Third, whether the
social aspects of motive-based trust have an impact that is distinct from the
influence of instrumental trust-related judgements.
Let me first explore these issues by drawing on a study of trust in the police
(Tyler and Huo, 2002). The key concern in this study is gaining voluntary
deference with the decisions of the police and the courts. This is the first type of
co-operative behaviour discussed earlier in the paper.
In this study 1,656 residents of two US cities had personal contact with the
police or the courts. The issue was whether they would willingly accept these
third-party efforts to resolve problems. As the percentages shown in Table II
indicate, acceptance was by no means automatic. For example, 23 per cent of
those who deal with a legal authority considered going to someone else to
overturn the decisions made, while 49 per cent felt that the situation could have
been handled in a better way.
Our first concern is whether issues of motive-based trust shape decision
acceptance. The items used to measure motive-based trust are shown in
Table III. The results of regression analyses using motive-based trust, shown
in Table IV, suggest that they do. The extent to which people indicated that

linked to their willingness to accept the decisions reached (beta ¼ 0.47,
p , 0.001).
Further, the influence of motive-based trust is distinct from the influence of
instrumental issues. Two instrumental issues are included in this analysis. One
is whether the person indicates that the authority behaved as expected; the
second whether they say that they think they can predict the authorities’ future
behaviour. These instrumental assessments had only a minor influence on the
willingness to accept decisions (beta ¼ 0.04, p , 0.01, for the degree to which
people felt they could predict the future actions of the authorities;
beta ¼ 2 0.02, n.s., for the degree to which their actions during the
encounter were as expected).
Finally, the influence of motive-based trust is distinct from the influence of
procedural justice. The equation shown in Table IV indicates that both
motive-based trust and procedural justice judgements have distinct influences
on people’s decisions about whether or not to accept the decisions made by
third-party authorities.

So, what distinctly social factors influence motive-based trust? Two factors
emerge as important in a separate analysis (see Table V). First, shared
background and values. People indicate more trust in the motives of people
with whom they share a social background.
Second, whether they feel that they have an understanding of why people
are acting as they do. Interestingly, this influence of understanding is distinct
from being able to predict what a person will do. People are focused on whether
they feel they understand why a person is acting as they are, not just on
whether they think that they can predict how a person will act in the future.
This is an attributional influence that is linked to judgements about whether a
person feels they understand the character and motivations of another.
All of these findings point to the value of a social conception of trust. First,
motive-based trust influences deference to authorities. If a person trusts that
the authorities with whom they are dealing are motivated by a concern for their
welfare, they are more willing to go along with decisions made by that
authority. In a situation such as social regulation, in which authorities are often
telling people that they cannot do things that they want to do, this ability to
gain deference is key to effectiveness.
Further, this influence of motive-based trust is not linked to the degree to
which people think that they can make effective and accurate estimates of the
future behaviour of others. Neither the degree to which the past behaviour of
the authorities has been as expected, not the degree to which their future
behaviour is believed to be predictable are the key issues shaping deference. It
is interesting that it is the degree to which a person thinks that they understand
why someone is acting (i.e. they understand their motivations) and not the
ability to predict their actions that matters. We want to know the “character” of
others – feeling that those others are, in fact, interested in our needs and
concerns.
Work organisations
While legal authorities focus on preventing undesirable behaviours, the
managers of work organisations are concerned with both limiting negative and
undesirable behaviour and with promoting desirable behaviour. As was the

<-----Page 7----->case with legal authorities, managers also prefer that both forms of
co-operative behaviour be voluntarily motivated. Otherwise, the organisation
is required to deploy resources for incentives and sanctions that could be used
for other organisational purposes.
What motivates voluntary co-operative behaviours? Tyler and Blader (2000)
compare the role of two types of internal motivations to the motivating
influence of the resource levels reflected by the pay and other benefits a person
is receiving from their organisation. The two types of internal motivations are
attitudes and values. Attitudes reflect the things that people are internally
motivated to do. Two attitudes are measured in this study. The first is intrinsic
enjoyment of one’s job. The second is commitment to one’s group. People might
potentially be motivated either because of their enjoyment of their work and/or
because of their loyalty to their group. The key value measured is a person’s
feelings of responsibility/obligation to follow rules, a motivation which we will
refer to as legitimacy (Tyler, 1990).
The influence of attitudes and values on deference to rules and on extra-role
behaviour can be compared with the influence of people’s instrumental
judgements. Two such instrumental judgements are examined. The first is the
person’s judgement about the level of resources they receive from the group.
The second is their evaluation of the favourability of the resources they receive
from their job, relative to available alternatives.
I will use regression analyses to examine the impact of attitudes, values and
resource judgements on co-operative behaviour in the sample of employees
studied by Tyler and Blader (2000). These analyses are shown in Table VI.
They suggest that attitudes and values have an important influence on
co-operative behaviours. Attitudes are the most important predictor of
extra-role behaviours (beta ¼ 0.54, p , 0.001), while values are the most
important predictor of deference to rules (beta ¼ 0.47, p , 0.001).
Our primary concern is with the potential importance of motive-based trust
in shaping people’s co-operative behaviour in a work organisation. We can

compare that influence of motive-based trust to the influence of judgements
about the predictability of the decisions of managers and to judgements about
managerial competence. The items used to index each construct are shown in
Table VII.
The influence of motive-based trust is shown in Table VIII. The findings
suggest that motive-based trust has a strong influence on attitudes and on
extra-role behaviours. It leads people to enjoy their jobs and to want to help
their group and to do so in voluntary ways. Motive-based trust has less impact
on values. People who trust the motives of management do not indicate that
organisational rules are more legitimate. However, motive-based trust does
influence deference to rules. Hence, there is a smaller influence of motive-based
trust on people’s willingness to limit their engagement in undesirable
behaviours such as stealing, taking long lunch breaks, etc.
A replication of this analysis including a measure of procedural justice,
shown in Table IX, indicates that motive-based trust and procedural justice have
distinctive patterns of influence. Motive-based trust shapes attitudes and
extra-role behaviour, while procedural justice shapes values and deference. This
pattern is consistent with that already outlined and suggests that the influence of
motive-based trust is that it encourages people to commit themselves to their
work and work organisations, leading to extra-role behaviour.

<-----Page 9----->Finally, we can ask how procedural elements shape motive-based trust.
Procedural justice theories distinguish between two key procedural elements:
the quality of decision-making and the quality of the interpersonal treatment
that people receive (Tyler and Blader, 2000). These two elements can be used as
antecedents of motive-based trust. The results of such a regression analysis are
shown in Table X. They results indicate that both elements shape motive-based
trust. However, the primary influence is in the quality of people’s interpersonal
treatment by group authorities and rules.
Interestingly, once the influence of quality of decision making and quality of
treatment is taken into account, there is no independent impact of either the

expectedness of past treatment or the predictability of future treatment. Hence,
the definition of motive-based trust is primarily “relational” in character (Tyler
and Lind, 1992).
Overview
As the findings of these two studies suggest, there is considerable value to
thinking of trust as a distinct and social motivation. Further, the findings
suggest that we should be considering two social motivations, motive-based
trust and procedural justice. Each makes a distinct contribution to the
understanding of co-operation in social groups.
As we enter into this new era of co-operation among people, organisations,
and society, we need to focus on developing new consensual forms of
co-operation. These new forms emphasise gaining “buy in” from people, rather
than seeking to shape their behaviour by changing the contingencies of the
situation via incentives or sanctions.
This desire for consensual relationships suggests that we need to better
understand how to develop supportive attitudes and values. If people want to
co-operate, and/or feel that they ought to co-operate, then their behaviour is
motivated internally and the need for strategies linked to incentives and
sanctions is minimised. This is equally true of social regulation and
management.
The findings outlined further suggest that motive-based trust and
procedural justice are similar, in that both are social motives, but have a
distinct influence on co-operative behaviour. Trust is linked more directly to
social relationships, while procedural justice involves evaluations of the
manner in which decisions are being made.
When we compare the literatures on motive-based trust and procedural
justice to each other it is clear that justice has the longer history. However, as
the findings presented make clear, motive-based trust does not simply
duplicate the ground already covered by procedural justice. It makes a distinct
contribution to our efforts to understand co-operation in organisations. Trust is
clearly central to understanding the dynamics of organisations. Furthermore, it
seems to reflect different motivations than those already outlined in the justice
literature. What we need is a clearer understanding of those distinct trust-based
motivations.
We can look for better understanding of trust to the work of Heider (1958) on
attribution theory. Heider (1958) suggests that an effort to focus on the motives
and character of others is fundamental to people’s interactions with others.
This effort to infer motives as an antecedent to interaction fits easily into the
framework outlined here. People’s motive-based trust is linked to their
inferences about the motives and character of others. Hence, in the future the
trust literature make fruitfully link itself up to the literature on motive
attributions as a way to better frame the discussion of trust issues.

<-----Page 11----->The findings outlined also point to the literature on social relationships as a
possible future direction for trust studies. It is found that people are more
willing to trust those with whom they feel they share a social connection, for
example a similar background. We need to better understand the nature of the
bonds that people draw on to make inferences about trust.
Further, the findings outlined point to one especially important type of trust.
Motive-based trust is one important type of social motive that acts beyond the
operation of rational calculations or expectations to shape behaviour towards
others.
Motive-based trust is central in situations in which the traditional
mechanisms for motivating co-operation are problematic, and the development
of productive interaction requires the existence of other, more social,
motivations. in which traditional mechanisms may be inadequate to sustain
co-operation. Motive-based trust may be especially important in particular
settings because it is in such settings that rational forms of trust are least likely
to be effective.
One such situation occurs when relationships are beginning. People with a
limited history are unlikely to feel that they can predict each other’s behaviour.
They need to have a way to build trust swiftly. This requires the ability to infer
the character of others based on inferences of their character and benevolence.
Further, motive-based trust may be needed in virtual situations in which
traditional face-to-face interactions are limited in scope. In such situations, the
mechanisms that led people to trust because they had a long history of personal
experience are no longer possible. People must deal with relationships without
social and physical elements, and must find new ways to trust in those settings.
Traditional mechanisms of trust may also be inadequate during times of
crisis or change. It is when organisations are most in need of co-operation from
their members that they are often least able to provide the incentives or
sanctions that would motivate that co-operation. They need to be able to rely on
the good will of their members. Here trust becomes crucial. Since people are
unlikely to be able to know the future in a time of change, all that they can do is
to evaluate whether they think that management will be motivated to make
changes in ways that will take the welfare of group members into account.
