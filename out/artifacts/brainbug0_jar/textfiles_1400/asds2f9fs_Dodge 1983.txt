DODGE,KENNETHA. Behaoioral Antecedents of Peer Social Status. CHILDDEVELOPMENT,
1983,
54, 1386-1399. The goal of this study was to observe the development of sociometric status in
children's peer groups over time. 48 previously unacquainted second-grade boys were brought
together in 6 play groups of 8 boys each. Play groups met under supervision for 1hour per session
for 8 sessions in a single room. Observers recorded the free-play interactive behaviors of each boy
using a complex event-recording system developed for the investigation. Video cameras also
recorded boys' behaviors for later analysis. At the conclusion of the eighth session of each play
group, sociometric interviews were conducted with each boy. Status groups of popular, rejected,
neglected, controversial, and average boys were identified according to previously established
criteria. The behaviors of these groups were analyzed in an effort to determine the behavioral
antecedents of peer status. Boys who became rejected or neglected were those who engaged in
inappropriate behaviors. They socially approached peers quite frequently, particularly in early
sessions, but were rebuffed at relatively high rates in those approaches. Rejected boys engaged in
physical aggression more than any other group. Popular boys refrained from aggression and were
received quite positively by the peers whom they approached. Controversial boys engaged in
high frequencies of both prosocial and antisocial behaviors. The data thus pointed toward the
critical roles of social approach patterns and peer-directed aggression in determining peer status.

This study is an examination of the process by which children come to be popular,
neglected, and rejected among their peers.
Interest in the development of peer status
has been stimulated by the discovery that
negative peer status in childhood is predictive of a variety of maladaptive outcomes in
adolescence and adulthood (Cowen, Pederson, Babigian, Izzo, & Trost, 1973; Robins,
1966; Roff, Sells, & Golden, 1972). Measures
of sociometric status are now being used to
select children for preventive intervention
programs and to evaluate progress in those
programs (e.g., Ladd, 1981; Oden & Asher,
1977). Still, little is known of the behavioral
patterns that may precede or help determine
children's peer status.
Research on the behavioral determinants of children's peer group sociometric
status has had a long history (see Asher &
Hymel, 1981, and Asher, Oden, & Gottman,
1977, for reviews) that has been marred by
significant limitations. The most obvious of

these limitations is that in almost all studies
researchers first have identified the social
status of children in already existing peer
groups, and then have conducted observations of those children for the purpose of
determining correlates of status. It is quite
possible that the observed behaviors in
these studies are as much a response to an
acquired status as a determinant of that
status. Also, labeling by peers can have the
effect of maintaining status even when behavioral patterns that have contributed to the
acquisition of status disappear (Dodge,
1980). Antecedents of peer status, therefore,
may not be identifiable in observational
studies of children in already existing peer
groups. The present study sought to overcome this problem by observing children
during their initial interactions in newly
formed peer groups, and then following
them forward until social status had become
firmly established.
A second problem with previous studies

has been the use of inadequate measures of
peer status. Often, researchers have used
low frequency scores on positive sociometric
nomination items (such as "whom do you
like?') as the criterion for selection to a
low-status group. Since positive nomination
scores only correlate with negative nomination scores at a -.2 level (Asher & Hymel,
1981), the use of only a positive score as the
criterion for selection confounds two groups
of low-status children: those who are not
liked and are highly disliked and those who
are not liked but are not disliked either
(Gottman, 1977). The term "rejected" has
been applied to the former group and "neglected" to the latter group (Coie, Dodge, &
Coppotelli, 1982). A similar confound occurs
at the positive end of the status dimension,
unless those children who are highly liked
and not disliked are distinguished from
those children who are both highly liked and
highly disliked. The term "popular" has
been applied to the former group and "controversial" to the latter group. The latter
group has seldom been studied. In the present investigation, I traced the development
over time of each of these four status groups
and compared them to a fifth group, labeled
"average."
The behaviors observed in the present
study were drawn directly from a review of
the literature on behavioral correlates of
sociometric status. Because Marshall and
McCandless (1957) found that the frequency
of associative, cooperative play was positively related to peer acceptance, cooperative play was targeted for observation in the
present study and was contrasted with aggressive play, inappropriate play, and solitary play. Dodge, Coie, and Brakke (1982)
found that, in the classroom, rejected children engaged in more off-task behavior than
did other children. Likewise, in one of the
very few longitudinal studies of sociometric
status, Hunt and Solomon (1942) found a relation between "restlessness" and poor peer
acceptance. Therefore, on-task and off-task
behaviors were integrated into the behavior
coding system used in the present study. A
number of researchers have found a relationship between antisocial behavior and
peer rejection (Dodge et al., 1982; Hartup,
Glazer, & Charlesworth, 1967; McGuire,
1973). Therefore, several antisocial behaviors were observed presently, including verbal aggression, physical aggression, and
exclusions of peers from play. These antisocial behaviors were contrasted with prosocia1 behaviors such as social conversation

and physical affection and with other kinds
of verbalizations. Because Dodge et al.
(1982) found that rejected children interacted with their classroom teacher more
frequently than did other children, interactions between children and their play
group leader were noted. Finally, Putallaz
and Gottrnan (1981) have found that the
quality of social approach patterns, sometimes called "group entry attempts" or "initiations," was related to peer acceptance, in
a structured laboratory setting. Corsaro
(1981) has found that these social approaches
are common among young children in a
school setting but are rebuffed by peers at a
high rate, indicating that the group entry
process is a difficult one to master. Therefore, social approaches were noted by
observers in the present study.
Because previous studies (e.g., Putallaz
& Gottman, 1981) have found that the responses by peers to the behaviors of children
are related to sociometric status, peer responses to each of the behaviors coded in
this study were also coded as positive, neutral, or negative. Patterns in peer interaction
were examined through multivariate contingency table analyses (Gottman & Notarius,
1978) and information theory statistics
(Attneave, 1959). The use of such interactional designs and sequential analyses has
been advocated for observational research
on peer relations (Cairns, 1979) but is fairly
uncommon.
Finally, physical attractiveness is a
known correlate of positive status (Kleck,
Richardson, & Ronald, 1974). Ratings were
made of the physical attractiveness of the
subjects in this study. The predictability of
status from these ratings was compared to
the predictability of status from the behavioral measures.

Method
Overview

To untangle previous methodological
problems and to observe the development of
social status over time, a short-term longitudinal study was undertaken. Previously
unacquainted children were brought together in newly constructed play groups for
eight 1-hour-long sessions. Observers and
video cameras recorded the interactive behaviors of each child. At the end of the
eighth session, sociometric interviews were
conducted to determine the status acquired
in the group by each child. Coie and
Kupersmidt (1983) and Pelham (Note 1)have

<-----Page 3----->1388 Child Development
found that the correlation between the status
acquired by children in experimentally contrived play groups such as these and the
status .they have in their regular classrooms
is quite high. These findings are cited to
demonstrate the ecological validity of the
procedures employed in the present study.
The behavior of children in each status
group during each of the eight sessions was
then analyzed to determine the behavioral
antecedents of status. Additional data on the
physical attractiveness and peer perceptions
of each child were collected and analyzed in
order to understand further the behavioral
and perceptual mechanisms involved in the
acquisition of social status.

Subjects
A flyer distributed in the second-grade
classrooms of 12 local elementary schools
was used to recruit 56 boys for this study.
Boys were 7 and 8 years old and of varying
social class backgrounds. Ninety percent of
the children were white. Boys were randomly assigned to one of seven play groups
(eight boys in each group), with the restriction that no boy could have had prior acquaintanceship with any other boy in his
play group. An interview conducted at the
homes of subjects prior to the initiation of
the play groups guaranteed that this restriction was met. Since the first play group was
administered as a pilot group, only the data
of the remaining six groups (48 boys) were
used for all analyses.
Administration of Play Groups
Play groups met for 1 hour a day for 8
days over a &-week period during the summer. Each boy was driven to and from the
play group by a member of the research team
to ensure that the only contact that the boys
had with each other occurred during the play
group sessions. Transporting the boys also
guaranteed that no boy was absent for more
than one of the eight sessions. Boys were
paid one dollar for each day of attendance.
An adult female group leader structured
the first 20 min of each play group session by
engaging the children in a task, such as
making paper airplanes, to simulate a classroom setting. During the remaining 40 min
children were free to play as they wished in
a large (7 x 10-m) room stocked with furniture and toys, while the group leader sat in
the comer of the room.
Obseruation of Peer-Interactive Behaviors
Three observers sat behind a one-way
mirror in a room adjacent to the play room
and coded the behaviors of each child on a

rotating basis. The boys wore numbered
T-shirts of various colors to aid quick
identification by observers. Each coder observed a child for a 6-min period, took a 45sec break, and then moved on to a specified
second child, according to a prearranged
schedule. Synchronized audio cues were
used to help observers code behaviors in
real time, to the nearest 10-sec interval. The
schedule for coding was arranged so that
each child was observed for at least three
6-min intervals each hour, once during the
structured time and twice during the unstructured time. Because of the low frequency of interactive behaviors in the
structured time, data were summed across
observation times for all analyses.
A complex event-recording system was
developed for this investigation. Each time
that the observers noticed an event, they simultaneously coded the time (in 10-sec
blocks), context (structured vs. unstructured), content (one of 18 behavior
categories), and peer targetis) (identified by
T-shirt numbers) of each event, as well as
the peer's reaction (positivelaccept, neutral/
ignore, or negativetreject) when the event
was an interactive behavior. Observers
coded at least one, and frequently more than
one, event per 10-sec interval. The 18 behavior categories were of five types: solitary
activity, interactive play, verbalizations,
physical contact with peers, and interactions
with the group leader. Solitary activities included solitary play, watching peers, on-task
behavior (usually in the structured context),
and off-task behavior (including walking
around aimlessly during the structured
time). The interactive play behaviors included cooperative play (involving turn
taking or games), aggressive play (often
called rough-and-tumble play), and inappropriate play (norm-violating behavior,
such as standing on tables and disrupting
peers' games). The verbal behaviors included social conversations with peers,
norm-setting statements (directives to peers,
rule making, etc.), hostile verbalizations (including insults, threats, and contentious
statements), supportive statements (compliments and offers of help), exclusions of peers
from a play activity, and extraneous verbalizations (including laughs, cheers, and
kibitzing). The physical contact behaviors
included hits (physically striking a peer in a
fight), object possession (grabbing an object
from a peer), and physically affectionate behaviors (such as holding hands or hugging).
Two categories of interaction with the group

the leader and reprimanded by the leader.

conducted with each subject by a male who
had not observed the play group sessions.

each play group. Following the completion
of the play groups, two new observers, each
blind to the children's social status designations, were trained to code from the video
record the social approach and social termination behaviors of each child. A social approach was defined as an attempt to initiate
play or verbal interaction with a particular
peer or group of peers, and a social termination was defined as a voluntary withdrawal
from peer interaction. Unlike the previous
coding, observers coded all of the social approach behaviors of each child, in each session, rather than just behaviors in short time
samples. Observers were allowed to view
and review the video record until they were
sure of their coding. For each child, they
noted: (1) the time, to the nearest second, of
each occurrence of a social approach by or
toward the target child; (2) the initiator (the
target, a peer, or a mutual approach) and the
recipient of the approach; (3) the duration, in
seconds, of the social interaction that followed the approach (the duration was later
recoded as short if 0-5 sec, moderate if 6-60
sec, and long if more than 60 sec); (4) the
affect of the social interaction that took place
(positive, neutral, or negative); and, (5)
which child terminated the interaction by
leaving the physical proximity of the other
child (the target child, the peer[s], or a
mutual termination). Of course, each social
approach sequence was coded at least twice,
once for each child involved in the interaction.
Observers were trained over a 6-week
period using the video record of the pilot
play group. As a measure of interobserver
agreement, the frequency that both observers agreed that a social approach had taken
place (with a 10-sec interval leeway) was divided by the frequency of agreements plus
the frequency of disagreements. Agreement
for the pilot group, as calculated in this manner, was 80%. Using only those instances in
which both observers agreed that a social
approach had taken place, interobserver
agreements were calculated separately for
each of the four remaining codes. The
observers agreed on the initiator of the approach 82% of the time, the duration (short,
moderate, or long) of the interaction 89% of
the time, the affect of the interaction 78% of
the time, and which child ended the interaction 83% of the time. Observer agreement
was continually checked during the coding
of regular play groups by having each observer code one-half of the play group
sessions plus one-fourth of the sessions

coded by the other observer, or 62.5% of all
sessions. Acceptable agreement (75% or
higher) was maintained for each category.

Results
Age and Physical Attractiveness Ratings
Within the small range of ages of boys in
this study, age was found not to have an effect on status, as assessed by a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean
physical attractiveness rating received by
each child was also subject to ANOVA. A
significant main effect of sociometric status,
F(4,43) = 3.32, p < .02, and subsequent
Newman-Kuels tests of cell comparisons
(using a harmonic n ) (p < .05) indicated that
the rejected group (M = 2.6) was perceived
as significantly less attractive than the controversial group (M = 2.3), which was
significantly less attractive than the neglected (M = 2.0), average (M = 2.0), and
popular (M = 1.8) groups.
Peer Assessments
Mean rankings were computed for each
child for each of the four peer-assessment
items and were subject to a multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA). A significant multivariate effect of status was found,
F(16,134) = 4.92, p < .001. Significant univariate effects were found for the items aggressive, F(4,43) = 25.84, p < .001, leader,
F(4,43) = 7.42, p < .001, and shares, F(4,43)
= 19.94, p < .001. Newman-Kuels tests (p <
.05) revealed the following patterns. The
rejected (M = 2.2) and controversial (M =
2.8) groups received higher rankings as aggressive than the neglected (M = 4.3), average (M = 4 4 , and popular (M = 4.9) groups.
The popular children (M = 3.1) were viewed
as better leaders than the average (M = 4.0),
neglected (M = 4.1), and controversial (M =
4.3) children. The rejected children (M =
5.0) were viewed as poorer leaders than any
other group. Peers ranked the popular group
(M = 3.3) as more likely to share things than
the average (M= 3.7) and neglected (M =
4.0) groups, which in turn were more likely
to share things than the controversial (M =
4.8) and rejected (M = 5.4) groups.
Frequencies of interpersonal Behaviors
Frequencies of each of the 15 behavior
types were computed for each child in each
session as the number of 10-sec intervals in
which each behavior occurred per 6-min
period. Nine of the 48 subjects missed one
session each. Missing a session did not
significantly affect social status. Group
means were inserted for subjects in missed

<-----Page 6----->Kenneth A. Dodge 1391
sessions, in order to simplify analyses.
Group means for these frequencies were
compared by a repeated-measures leastsquares MANOVA, in which status was a
between-subjects factor and session number
(1-8) was a within-subjects factor. Planned
analyses of the linear trend of session
number and its interaction with status were
conducted. Significant multivariate effects
were followed by univariate ANOVAs.
When the univariate ANOVA was significant, single degree-of-freedom planned
contrasts between the average group and
each other status group were tested. Even
though these contrasts are not orthogonal,
they were felt, a priori, to be of greatest
interest because the status groups were
defined in terms of deviations from the
"norm" sociometrically.

and extraneous verbalizations, F(1,301) =
28.64, p < .001. Because the frequency of
hostile verbalizations appeared to increase
at a more rapid rate than the frequency of
other verbal comments, the proportion of all
verbal interactions that consisted of hostile
verbalizations was calculated for each child
and analyzed in an additional ANOVA. Indeed, the proportion of all verbal statements
that were hostile was found to increase over
time, F(1,301) = 16.84, p < .001. Finally, the
frequency of reprimands by the group leader
also increased over time, F(1,301) = 3.74, p
< .06.

were reprimanded significantly less frequently than the average children. They
displayed a tendency toward more cooperative play than the average children, although
this difference was not significant.
The children who became rejected were
those who engaged in a great deal of aggressive and inappropriate behaviors. The rejected children displayed significantly more
inappropriate play, hostile verbalizations,
exclusions of peers, and hitting of peers than
the average children. Also, they engaged in
less social conversation than the average
children.
The children who were neither liked
nor disliked but were neglected by their
peers spent significantly more time in solitary play than the average children. They
conversed with the group leader less
frequently than the average children and
made fewer extraneous verbalizations. Like
the rejected children, they displayed
significantly more inappropriate play than
the average children, but, unlike the rejected children, the neglected children did
not display high rates of aggression. In fact,
they made fewer hostile verbalizations than
the average children.
The children who became sociometrically controversial, while small in number,
presented a distinct pattern of behavior.
They spent very little time in solitary play
(relative to the average group) and a great
deal of time interacting with peers. The
frequencies of their cooperative play, social conversation with the leader and with
peers, and extraneous verbalizations were
significantly greater than those of the average group. Also, the frequencies of their aggressive play, hostile verbalizations, and
exclusions of peers from play were
significantly greater than those of the average group,-and they were reprimanded by
the leader more than the average group. The
controversial children, then, were quite actively involved with peers, in both prosocial
and antisocial endeavors.
Session x status interactions.-The
multivariate interaction between status and
the linear trend of sessions yielded a
significant effect, F(60,1290) = 1.49, p < .01.
Of the 15 univariate tests of the same interaction, five were significant: cooperative
play, F(4,301) = 2.79, p < .03; social conversation, F(4,301) = 4.20, p < .01; extraneous verbalizations, F(4,301) = 2.43, p < .05;
hostile verbalizations, F(4,301) = 2.46, p <
.05; and reprimands by the group leader,

F(4,301) = 4.40, p < .01. For each of these
five variables, four single degree-of-freedom
interactions between the linear trend component of the sessions factor (hereafter
called "time") and each of the four contrasts
in status groups (the average group vs. each
of the other four groups) were tested as
planned contrasts. For the variable social
conversation, the interaction between time
and the contrast between the average and
popular groups was significant (p < .05). The
status-group means for each session for this
variable are depicted in Figure 1. It is apparent from the figure that the children who
became popular steadily increased the
frequency of their social conversation over
time, whereas after the first session the average children did not. Likewise, the rejected
and the controversial children did not. The
neglected children actually decreased the
frequency of their social conversation across
sessions. These patterns were similar to
those for cooperative play and extraneous
verbalizations.
The four planned contrasts for the variable hostile verbalizations yielded three
significant effects. Whereas the controversial
and rejected groups displayed more hostile
verbalizations than the average group did in
each session, the difference between the
controversial and average group increased
across sessions (p < .05), while the difference between the rejected and average
group decreased (p < .05) across sessions.
Also, whereas the average group displayed
more hostile verbalizations than the neglected group did overall, the difference
between these groups increased over time (p
< .05). The patterns of means and tests of
significance for reprimands by the group
leader were similar to those for hostile verbalizations.
Covariance Analyses
Two multivariate analyses of covariance
(MANCOVA)were conducted in order to test
the predictability of status from the 15 behavioral frequencies after physical attractiveness had been covaried out, and vice
versa. The first MANCOVA yielded a
significant effect of status, F ( 6 0 , l l l ) = 1.60,
p < .02, canonical r = .84, indicating that the
15 behaviors predicted 71% of the variance
in status, even after controlling for physical
attractiveness. The second MANCOVA was
not significant, F(4,28) = 1.39, N.S., indicating that physical attractiveness did not
significantly predict status after the 15 behavior scores had been covaried out.

Peer Responses to Child Behaviors
ANOVAs of peer response.-The
proportion of all peer responses to a child that
were positive and the proportion that were
negative were computed for each child for
each session. These proportions served as
dependent variables in ANOVAs that were
similar to those for the frequencies of behavior. Proportions were used as dependent
variables (rather than frequencies) because
proportions are not biased by the frequencies of behaviors. A significant main
effect of status was found for the proportion
of positive peer responses received, F(4,43)
= 3.88, p < .01. Planned contrasts among
groups revealed that the popular (M = .43)
and controversial (M = .58) groups received
significantly greater proportions of positive
responses than the average group (M = .38).
The neglected (M = .34) and rejected (M =
.36) groups received the lowest proportions
of positive responses, but not significantly
lower than the average group. Significant
effects of the linear trend of sessions were
found for both positive and negative responses, F(1,301) = 6.06, p < .02, and
F(1,301) = 11.58, p < .001, respectively.
Peer responses became more frequently
positive and more frequently negative over
time, and less frequently neutral. A significant interaction between time and status
was found for the proportion of positive re-

sponses received, F(4,301) = 3.11, p < .02.
Planned contrasts revealed that the proportion ofpositive peer responses to the average
group increased over time (from .28 to .42),
whereas the proportion of positive responses
to the neglected group decreased over time
(from .44 to .25) (p < .05). The proportion of
positive responses to the rejected group remained relatively low in all sessions (.29 in
session 1and .28 in session 8). Responses to
the popular group became more frequently
positive (from .30 to .55), as did the responses to the controversial group (from .49
to .66).
Contingency analyses of peer responses
to behaviors.-In
order to investigate the
relationships between children's interactive
behaviors and the responses to those behaviors by peers, a multidimensional contingency table of frequencies was constructed. In addition to behaviors and
responses, other dimensions of this table included the target child's status and the session number. Information-theory statistics
(Attneave, 1959; McGill, 1954) were computed to evaluate the relationships among
variables. The advantages of these statistics
over simple bivariate x Z statistics a r e that
terms analogous to main effects, interactions,
and residuals can be computed with these
discrete data, and a measure of proportional

<-----Page 9----->1394 Child Development
reduction in the uncertainty of one variable
that is predictable from another variable can
be defined. This uncertainty reduction term
is analogous to the proportion of variance accounted for by a variable in multiple regression analyses. Finally, x 2 s can be used to
determine which conditional probabilities
in a multidimensional table contribute to
uncertainty reduction (Sackett, 1979).
The multivariate information analyses
determined that the peer responses varied
directly as a function of the type of behavior
by the target child, x2(24) = 26,124.13, p
< .001. Specifically, 52.2% of the uncertainty
in peer responses (above base rates) could
be reduced by knowledge of the type of
interactive behavior by a target child. As
Table 2 shows, cooperative play and physically affectionate behavior each had a high
probability of being received positively,
whereas inappropriate behavior, hostile
verbalizations, exclusions of peers, hitting
peers, and object possession each had a high
probability of being received negatively by
peers. Social conversation and extraneous
verbalizations received mostly neutral peer
responses. Aggressive play received mixed
peer responses.
The analyses also determined that peer
responses varied as a function of the social
status of the target child, x2(8)= 243.60, p <
.001, and 3.2% of the uncertainty in peer responses could be reduced by knowledge of
the social status of the target child. This
analysis parallels the ANOVAs of peer responses reported earlier. As shown in Table
2, the peer responses to popular children
were more likely to be positive and less
likely to be negative than were the peer responses to rejected and neglected children.
Interestingly, that table reveals that even
when rejected and neglected children engaged in the same behaviors as other children, the peer responses that they received
were less frequently positive and more
frequently negative than the peer responses
to other children. Popular children had a
higher probability of receiving a positive response than the rejected and neglected children for 7 of the 11 interactive behavior
types. Eleven x2 analyses were performed to test the differences between the
popular group and the combined rejected
and neglected group, one for each behavior.
Four of the 11 tests were significant: for
cooperative play, x "1) = 25.31, p < .01, aggressive play, ~ ' ( 1 =
) 40.11, p < .01, hostile
verbalizations, x "1) = 6.00, p < .02, and
conversation with the group leader,
x2(1) = 4.32, p < .05. In each case, peers

responded more favorably to popular children than to rejected or neglected children.
The multivariate information analyses
also revealed that peer responses varied as a
function of the session in which they occurred, ~ ' ( 1 4 )= 184.87, p < .001, in ways
that paralleled the findings of the ANOVAs
of peer responses. Session number accounted for 2.1% of the variance in peer responses.

Patterns of Social Approach and Social
Termination
In all, 4,667 social interactions were
coded from the video record, or an average of
12.2 interactions per child per session. Each
interaction consisted of the codes described
earlier. Multidimensional contingency tables of the frequencies of each of the codes
were derived, and multivariate information-theory statistics (Attneave, 1959), calculated as described earlier, were used to
evaluate the relationships among the codes.
In all, the multivariate information
analyses revealed that 12% of the uncertainty in the affect of children's social
interactions could be reduced by knowledge
of the social status of the participants, the
session in which the interaction took place,
the initiator of the interaction, and the duration of the interaction.
The major findings of these analyses are
as follows. First, a significant relationship
between the initiator of interactions and social status was found, x "8) = 42.16, p < .001.
The popular group (M = 3.0) socially approached peers less fiequently per session
than did any other group (rejected M = 4.1,
neglected M = 3.8., controversial
M = 3.6.
and average M = 3.9), but the popular group
(M = 7.8) was approached by peers more
frequently than any other group (rejected M
= 7.0, neglected M = 6.5, controversial M =
5.7, and average M = 6.0).

What was it about the interactions involving popular children that made them so
attractive to peers? Three patterns emerged
that may help answer this question. A significant relationship between social status
and the duration of an interaction, x2(8) =
17.69, p < .001, indicated that the interactions involving popular children,
particularly the ones initiated by popular
children, lasted longer than the interactions involving any other group. Also,
a significant relationship between social
status and the affect of interactions, ~ ' ( 8 )=
17.32, p < .001, indicated that the interactions involving popular children were

any other group. Finally, a significant relationship between social status and the
child who terminated social interactions was
found, x2(8)= 58.01, p < .001. Popular children were less likely to terminate social
interactions than were other children.
The multivariate information analyses
also revealed a significant relationship between social status and session number,
~ ' ( 2 8=
) 113.96, p < .001, in the frequency
of social approaches. This relationship is depicted in Figure 2. As shown in that figure,
during early sessions the neglected and rejected children socially approached peers at
high rates, relative to popular children. In
later sessions, neglected and rejected children began to approach peers less
frequently, as if they were giving up or
withdrawing from the social activities of the
group. The popular children, on the other
hand, maintained a constant pattern of social
approach behavior, receiving positive responses consistently.

Discussion
The observational data of this study indicate that the behavioral patterns of boys
during their initial encounters with peers
significantly predict the social status that
they come to acquire, even beyond the pre-

FIG.2.-Mean

diction that can be made from an assessment
of physical attractiveness. Behavior patterns
of the boys evolved over time, yielding
unique profiles for each social status group.
Boys who came to be unpopular (rejected or neglected) among their peer group
were those who engaged in inappropriate
play behaviors, such as standing on tables
and disrupting ongoing peer activities. They
also spent a great deal of time in solitary
play, but their relative isolation is not due to
a lack of social initiative on their part. In fact,
during the early stages of the play group,
they socially approached peers more
frequently than did boys who eventually became popular. Their social approaches,
however, led to relatively short interactions
that were often met with rebuff by peers.
The early pattern displayed by these boys,
then, was one of moving frequently from
peer to peer in search of a play partner, but
failing to find one. The pattern changed in
later sessions, as they approached peers less
frequently, possibly giving up in their efforts
to integrate successfully into the peer group.
The differences in the frequency of interactive, cooperative play and social conversation between them and other boys became greater over time, and they became
more isolated. It is plausible to assert that
the isolation of these boys in the latter
sessions of the play groups is a consequence

SESSION

<-----Page 12----->Kenneth A. Dodge 1397
of their negative interactions and emerging
unpopular status, rather than a cause of their
status. Given the nonexperimental nature of
these data, however, such a causal conclusion is speculative. When rejected and neglected boys did approach peers in later
sessions, they were no more successful than
they had been in early sessions in soliciting
positive peer reactions.
The negative peer reactions to rejected
and neglected boys occurred as a function of
at least two factors. First, a relatively high
proportion of their peer-interactive behaviors involved aggressive, rough-and-tumble
play or behaviors that were considered inappropriate. These behaviors have been
shown to have high probabilities of receiving negative peer responses. Likewise, a low
proportion of their behaviors involved
cooperative play and social conversation,
behaviors that have a relatively low probability of receiving negative responses. The
second factor is that even when rejected and
neglected boys engaged in the same behaviors as did the other boys, the peer responses
that they received were still not as positive
as when the popular boys engaged in those
behaviors. Whether this difference is due to
a bias by peers toward popular children (due
to physical attractiveness or some other variable) or to subtle differences in the skill or
style of behaviors between popular and unpopular boys is not clear from these data.
The behavioral categories used in this study
were relatively broad, or molar. More discrete observations are required to evaluate
the latter possibility.
The distinctions between boys who became actively rejected by peers and those
who became sociometrically neglected were
found both in their behavior and in peer perceptions of them. The rejected boys engaged
in relatively high frequencies of antisocial
acts, including insults, threats, contentious
statements, exclusions of peers from their
play, and outright physical aggression. They
were viewed by peers as highly aggressive,
as poor leaders, and as unwilling to share.
The neglected boys, on the other hand, engaged in very little antisocial behavior.
Peers did not view them as aggressive; if
anything, they were viewed as shy. Also, rejected boys were less physically attractive
than neglected boys. The profile of rejected
boys, then, is one of antisocial behavior and
inept peer interaction, whereas the profile of
neglected boys is one of inept peer interaction in the absence of antisocial behavior.
Apparently, the findings of Hartup e t al.
(1967) have been replicated in this study,

using different behavioral codes. Prosocial
behaviors are associated with acceptance by
peers, whereas antisocial behaviors are antecedents to being actively rejected by
peers.
The boys who became popular among
their peers were quite physically attractive.
Whereas their behavior was not extremely
different from that of average-status boys,
they did engage in high rates of cooperative
play and social conversation, and they refrained from inappropriate behaviors and
verbal and physical aggression. They did not
socially approach peers with a high
frequency, but their social approaches most
often led to long interactions and positive
outcomes. These boys sustained their interactions in that they were not very likely to
initiate a termination. Peers viewed these
boys as good leaders who share things. Peers
responded more positively to their interpersonal behaviors than they did to those of
other children. Even when popular boys engaged in aggressive play, exclusions of
peers, or object possession, peers responded
more favorably to them than they did to
other children who engaged in the same behaviors. It is ~ o s s i b l ethat the aualitv of
these behaviors by popular boys was somehow less aversive than the quality of the
same behaviors by other boys. Another possible explanation is that these boys quickly
acquire a positive reputation among their
peers, so that they can, in effect, "get away
with" aversive behaviors without suffering
negative consequences. The early positive
reputation may be related to their
behavior-they
refrain from inappropriate
and aggressive play while still engaging
peers successfully-or it may be a function
of their physical attractiveness.
A

Merely engaging in cooperative play
and social conversation does not guarantee
popularity, however, as the distinctions
between popular and controversial boys
demonstrate. The children who acquired a
mixed status among their peers-they were
highly liked by some and highly disliked by
others, hence the label controversialengaged in even more prosocial behaviors
than the popular boys did. Their interactions
with peers were quite positive, and peer responses to their behaviors were more likely
to be positive than were the peer responses
for any other group. Clearly, they displayed
what might be called interpersonally skilled
behavior. The frequencies of their aggressive play, hostile statements, exclusions of
peers, and extraneous verbalizations (such as
making meaningless noises) were also quite

<-----Page 13----->1398 Child Development
high, however. Peers responded to these
behaviors quite negatively. The group
leader reprimanded these boys twice as
frequently as she did other boys. The behavior pattern for these mixed-status boys,
then, was also mixed and perhaps somewhat
unpredictable. They were actively involved
with peers, in both prosocial and antisocial
ways. It is possible that this mixed behavior
led to the mixed perceptions by peers. Caution must be expressed about these findings,
however, since only three of 48 boys
adequately fit sociometric criteria as controversial. Proportionately, this number of
controversial boys is almost identical to that
found by Coie et al. (1982) in a sample of 848
children, that is, 7%. Still, the present sample is quite small, and caution is warranted.

would make them any more successful with
peers. Obviously, emphasis must be placed
on the quality and competence of the social
approaches made by these children. Asher,
Markell, and Hymel (1981) concur with this
position.
In addition to the discovery ofprofiles of
children's status groups, the present study
points toward several meta-conclusions.
First, the quasi-naturalistic method of observing children in artificially constructed
peer play groups has proven to be quite
profitable. Control has been gained over the
contact among children without destruction
of naturally occurring peer interaction. The
development of behavior patterns over time
can be studied in great detail through this
method. Conclusions about the causes of
peer status, while still tentative, of course,
can be made with greater certainty. Even
more certainty might be achieved by repeated sociometric interviewing of children
during their initial encounters in a play
group. This procedure would allow one to
examine more closely the behavioral antecedents versus consequences of emerging
peer status. The effect of repeated interviewing, however, must be considered.

The profiles just outlined fit quite well
with most of the observational data that exist
on popular, rejected, and neglected boys in
their classroom settings (see Asher & Hymel,
1981). That is, the data of this study point
heavily toward the role of social approach
patterns and peer-directed aggression in the
development of peer social status. The observation of children during their first encounters, however, has shown that the beAnother conclusion is that researchers
