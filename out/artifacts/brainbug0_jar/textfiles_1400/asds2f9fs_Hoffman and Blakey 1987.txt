Growing
Concerns
Edited hy

You can negotiate
with venture
capitalists
If you're an entrepreneur
looking for venture capital, you're probably well aware of the frustrations in
finding loose purse strings in the financial markets. Your business is too new
or your product is still too untried to
qualify for conventional intermediateor long term debt financing. Or, although you know you might qualify for
a loan, you don't want to take on the
risk of more debt.
You've already used your
savings and borrowed from relatives to
get the seed capital you need. And you
may have reached the point where
you're generating healthy sales figures.
But you've .still got a long way to go before you can think of a public offering,
and you can't finance the growth you
want from retained earnings alone.
You need equity capital. If
your management has a good track record and your business has the potential
to generate a very high return on investment-say 30% to 40% per yearprofessional venture capitalists may be
prepared to fork over high-risk capital
of $ I million or more to finance your
growth. You don't have to have a hightech company to qualify; venture capitalists will also invest in conventional
businesses that offer high ROI potential. We have recently negotiated venture capital deals involving an oil-drilling equipment manufacturer, a movie
distributor, and a financial newsletter
publisher, among others.
Because you've heard that
money talks when a deal gets struc-

Harold M. Hoffman
and fames Blakey

tured, you may worry that if you rock
the boat by demanding too much, the
venture capital firm will lose interest.
That's an understandable attitude; venture capital is hard to get and if you've
gotten as far as the negotiating process,
you're already among the lucky few.
But that doesn't mean you
have to roll over and play dead. A venture capital investment is a business
deal that you may have to live with for
a long time. Although you'll have to
give ground on many issues when you
eome to the bargaining table, there is
always a point beyond which the deal
no longer makes sense for you. You
must draw a line and fight for the points
that really count. The extent to which
you can stand your ground will depend,
of course, on the leverage you have in
the negotiations. If your business already shows a profit or if you're selling a
highly desirable service or product,
you'll have more bargaining power than
if your company is burning up cavsh be*
cause sales are still several years down
the road.

Structuring the
investment
Before you and the venture
capitalists agree to a financing package,
you have to settle two important issues: the worth of your business before
the VCs put their money m and the

Valuation. Although your
company's tangible net worth (book value) may be low or negative, the fair
market value may be higher because of
proprietary technology, sales potential,
or other factors. You can more easi ly defend the value you place on your company if your projections are prepared with
the assistance of a reputable accounting
firm. It also helps to bring to the negotiations valuation data for comparable
business ventures.
It's important to negotiate
hard for a reasonable valuation of your
company because tbe amount of equity
you give the VCs will depend largely
on that calculation. Let's assume, for
instance, that you and the venture capitalists agree that your business is now
worth $4 million. Based on this valuation and the company's cash needs, you
strike a deal whereby the VCs will invest SI million. Tbe company's worth
accordingly rises to $5 million. The
VCs' $ 1 million should therefore buy
the equivalent of 20% of the total postinvestment equity outstanding.
Capital structure. When it
comes to capital structure, VCs like to
have their cake and eat it too; they want
equity because that will give them a big
slice of the profits if your company
succeeds, but they also want debt because debt bolders get paid before equity holders if the company fails. So VCs
usually invest in redeemable preferred
stock or debentures. If tbings go well,
the VCs can convert preferred stoek or
debentures to common stock. If things
go badly, however, tbey will get paid before you and other holders of common
stock.
If you have a choice, try to
get tbe VCs to accept a capital structure that consists entirely of common
stock, because it's simpler and keeps
the balance sheet clean. Chances are,
however, that you won't get them to

agree to this unless your bargaining position is extremely strong.
In some deals, the VCs ask
for a debenture together with warrants
that allow them to purchase common
stock at a nominal price. Under this arrangement, the VCs really do get to eat
their cake and have it too because they
don't have to convert their debt to
equity. They'll regain 100% of their investment when the debt is repaid and
stili share in the equity appreciation of
the company when they exereise their
warrants.
Although the documents
used to create debentures, preferred
stock, and warrants are usually so
much boilerplate, they must still be reviewed with care. One consideration is
the legal structure of the investment,
because the laws that govern what a
corporation can do with its securities
vary from state to state. Some states,
New York for example, do not permit
issuance of preferred stock that is redeemable at the holder's option. Antidilution and liquidation provisions,
which are discussed in the next section, can have unexpected effects if not
carefully crafted. Subordination provisions in debentures are also important,
because your trade creditors and institutional lenders will expect clear-cut
language placing the VCs' claim to the
cpmpany's assets behind their own.

more ebeaply tban in the past. Once
they have bougbt in, tbe VCs will want
to be sure tbat later stock issuances
won't water down the value of tbeir
investment.

Don't forget to
negotiate
for yourself.
Antidilution protection does
not mean tbat an investment must
always be convertible into a fixed percentage ownersbjp share of the company, without regard to intervening
growth and investment. As long as any
new eommon stock is sold at a priee

quickly as tbe VCs'sliee sbrinks-and
the VCs' investment will consequently
be diluted. To guard against tbis outcome, tbe VCs' conversion rigbt will
usually include an antidilution adjustment, or "ratcbet."

Let's return to tbe situation
Antidilution provisions. The in wbicb a VC firm has invested $ 1
million and received a 20% share of
VCs' preferred stock and debentures
will be convertible, at tbeir option, into your now $5 million company. On tbis
basis, if your company started out witb

Under a full ratcbet, if your
company sells one sbare of eommon
stock for 25 cents, tbe conversion rate
of the VCs' securities will drop to that
priee. The VCs' $1 million will now
buy four million common sbares. After
conversion, tbe VCs will thus own four
million out of eigbt million sbares, or
50% ratber than 20% of tbe company.
So even tbougb tbe sale of tbis single
share would bave no material dilutive
effect on tbe VCs' investment, under a
full ratebct provision such a sale would
severely reduce tbe value of the equity
tbat you and any otber founders bold.
Tbe more eommon and equitable approach is to negotiate a weighted ratcbet wbereby tbe conversion rate
for tbe VCs' sbares is adjusted down
to tbe weigbted average price per sbare
of all outstanding eommon after tbe
issuance of cbeaper stock. If only a few
ebeap sbares are issued, tbe downward
adjustment will be minor. Tbe usual
metbod is to treat all shares outstanding before the cbeaper dilutive issuance
as if they were floated at tbe initial
conversion price.
Mechanics aside, negotiating
tbe antidilution adjustment carefully
IS important because its purpose is to
place any dilutive effect of a future
stock issuance on you and tbe otber
founders, not on tbe VCs. You ean, however, seek to moderate tbe effect of such
a provision. For example, you can ask
tbat any common sbares issuable to tbe
VCs on conversion of tbeir preferred
stock or debentures be included in tbe
number of outstanding sbares used for
calculating tbe adjustment. Tbis will
spread tbe impact of a dilutive issuance
over a larger number of shares. You can
also request tbat any common shares
sold cheaply to officers, directors, employees, or consultants-a eustomary
practice in start-up situations, and one
that benefits all investors - will not
trigger tbe antidilution adjustment.
The risk posed by an antidilution provision, especially one with
a full ratebet, is that you and other
founders can be squeezed out if tbe
company runs into serious financial
problems. If tbe company's market
value falls far enough below the dollar
value of tbe VCs' original investment,
an antidilution adjustment will not
only wipe out your equity but can actually prevent you from seeking new investors, unless you ean get tbe VCs to
waive their antidilution rights.

Performance/forfeiture
provisions. As a condition for investment, the VCs may subject your stockincluding stock you acquired years
earlier - to a performance/forfeiture arrangement. Under this provision, if the
company fails to meet certain earnings
or other targets, you must forfeit some
orallof your stock.
A performance/forfeiture
provision serves several purposes. For
one, it protects the VCs from paying for
an overvalued company. The valuation
of unseasoned companies usually relies
heavily on speculative sales and earnings projections. If you overestimated
operating results by a wide margin, the
VCs will have paid too much for their
share of the company.
Because sales and earnings
forecasts are only projections, not
promises, the VCs cannot sue the company if management fails to perform as
expected. But if you've agreed to a
performance/forfeiture provision, they
can compensate themselves by increasing their ownership interest at your
expense.
Another reason the VCs may
want this provision is that if the company doesn't do well, it will be free to
reissue the forfeited stock to any new
executives brought in without diluting
the VCs' holdings. The performance/
forfeiture provision also serves as a
golden handcuff: it motivates you and
any other founders to work hard and
stick with the business.
If your company is in an
early stage of development, you may
have to place a large portion of your
stoek at risk of forfeiture because the
company's future is still very uncertain. As time passes, your enterprise is
more likely to gain in value and enjoy a
more predictable future. Then you can
legitimately refuse to agree to a forfeiture provision on the grounds that the
company's valuation is realistic, based
on past performance.
What should you negotiate
for? If the VCs insist on including a forfeiture provision, you may be able to
persuade them to include stoek bonuses
for performance that beats your sales
and earnings projections. If you're expected to forfeit stock for failing to hit
80% of the sales or earnings targets in
your business plan, for example, it
stands to reason that you should get an
equivalent bonus if you exceed those
targets.

Employment contracts. The
terms of the founders' employment are
always part of the financing arrangement. The VCs will want an agreement
covering your salary, bonuses, benefits,
and the circumstances under which
you can quit or be fired by the board.
It may come as a shock to realize that the VCs are making an investment in the company, not you. As
companies grow, they often require
professional management skills that
you and the other founding entrepreneurs may lack. The time may come
when the VCs think you're no longer
competent to run the business and decide to terminate your employment.

should be fully spelled out and kept
narrow in scope. Good examples of reasonable and narrow grounds include a
felony conviction, theft of company
property, or chronic failure to carry out
reasonable instructions from the hoard
despite repeated requests. If you're
fired and you decide to sue for wrongful
termination, you'll find it easier to
prove your case if specific grounds
were written into your contract.
Here are some other provisions to cheek for in the employment
agreement before signing the deal:

If the VCs are buying a controlling interest, you should seek an
employment contract of reasonable
duration-at least two to three years. If
your business is well past the start-up
stage, you may want to negotiate a
longer term of at least five years.
There is, however, one potential drawback: a long-term contract
may prevent you from leaving the company to do other things. If the company
is doing poorly, the VCs may want you
to stay and keep trying after you've decided to move on. Although the VCs
can't prevent your departure, they may
he able to sue you for breach of contract. Also, your contract may preclude
your working in the same industry
onee you quit.
The grounds on which the
board can terminate your employment

n
Are you assured adequate advance notice of the board's decision not
to renew your original contract or its
decision to renew but on terms that are
less beneficial to you?
D
Are you getting an adequate
severance package, including extended
insurance coverage?
n
If you're obligated not to
compete with the company after termination, what is the scope and duration
of your obligation? Are you only prohibited from hiringaway employees and
soliciting business from the company's
established customers, or must you
leave your line of business altogether?
D
Is the company required to
buy back any or all of your stock if you
are terminated, or does it have the option of doing so? How will the price be
determined: You should try to negotiate for an option to sell your stock hack
to the company according to a fixed
formula (for instance, a certain multiple of earnings) in the event that you're
fired. Many companies resist having to
buy back equity, so you may have trouble cashing out unless you include this
option in your contract.
You may, of course, persuade
tbe VCs to accept an employment
agreement that does not permit the
board to terminate you. Moreover, your
postemployment rights and obligations
may vary depending on whether you
quit of your own accord, did something
egregiously wrong, or were simply fired
because the board was unhappy with
your performance.
Control. You will have to let
the VCs share in running your company. In all likelihood you'll be required
to retain a nationally recognized accounting firm to certify your annual fiiContinued on page 22|

nancial statements. You may also bave
to accept tbe addition of managers
recommended by the VCs to cover areas
of the business they think need improvement. Tbe VCs will usually place
one of tbeir representatives on your
board and possibly more, depending on
tbeir ownership interest. Important

to all current shareholders [in proportion to tbeir boldings) before issuing
any new stoek to a third party. Because
tbis preemptive rigbt to purchase additional sbares allows investors to maintain an absolute percentage interest in
tbe company, tbe VCs are almost certain to insist on having it. You should
ask for no less for yourself. If tbe eompany issues more sbares, you sbould
bave the same opportunity as tbe VCs
to retain your current percentage of
ownership.

laws of many states) prohibit you from
selling an interest in your company unless you bave eitber filed a registration
statement with tbe SEC or qualified for
an exemption from registration. Registration IS an expensive process, which
most companies avoid by getting a
"private placement" exemption. To
qualify for this exemption, your company must approacb no more tban a
small number of wealthy and sophisticated investors.
Tbe securities laws also impose legal restrictions tbat generally
will prevent tbe VCs and other shareholders from reselling any stock acquired under a private placement exemption for at least two years, and may
limit the amount tbat can be sold without a registration even after tbat period.
Accordingly, the VCs will probably
want the rigbt to require the company
to register tbeir stock at the company's
expense.
Tbe VCs' registration rights
may include either piggyback rigbts,
whicb require tbe company to include
tbe VCs' sbares only if the company itself decides to file a registration statement, or demand rigbts, whicb allow
the VCs to force the company to file a
registration statement covering their
sbares. In granting piggyback rigbts to
tbe VCs, cbeck to make sure tbat the
provision includes you and the other
shareholders on an equal basis and that
tbe company's ability to grant future
piggyback rigbts is not limited.
Demand rigbts should be negotiated witb even greater eare. Because
of tbe expense, try to limit the VCs to
one request for a demand registration,
or they may keep tbe company in constant registration. Also, try to get them
to agree to postpone exercising tbis
rigbt until after the company's first
public offering. Without this restriction,
the VCs may be able to force tbe company to go publie before it can afford the
beavy reporting and otber burdens
imposed on publicly beld companies.
If you agree to registration
rigbts, you sbould he sure to include
yourself. As an insider, you will probably be subject to transfer limitations
under tbe securities laws regardless of
bow long you bave beld your stock. If
you don't have a contractual right to be
included in a registration, you may find
yourself squeezed out of a public offering by investors who do. Furtbermore,
be sure that tbe company is obliged to

If your business shows
a profit, you'll
have more bargaining
power.
Nevertheless, there is some
room for negotiation when it comes to
control provisions. If you and other
founders agree to a deal tbat leaves you
witb a minority interest, ask for no less
tban the VCs would probably demand:
tbat tbey guarantee you board representation and obtain your consent before making any major business decisions.
Shareholder agreements. In

almost all deals, tbe VCs will also want
tbe company's founders to enter into a
shareholders' agreement. Sueh an
agreement may require tbe founders to
vote for one or more directors of the
VCs' choosing. It may also grant tbe
VCs majority control of the hoard if the
business runs into serious trouble, even
if they bave only a minority interest.
Sbarebolder agreements can
also govern tbe sale of stock, including
newly issued shares. Under most arrangements, tbe seller is required to offer the stock to tbe company or other
parties to tbe agreement (insiders) before selling to outsiders. The VCs may
also want to include a cosale stipulation that would oblige any selling
sbarebolder to arrange for the otber insiders to participate in tbe sale to an
extent proportionate to tbeir holdings.
Usually the company is also
bound to the shareholder agreement.
Depending on tbe agreement, tbe company may bave to offer stock to tbe
VCs, to all parties to tbe agreement, or

Disclosure. Before tbe VCs
band over tbe money, tbey will doubtless want extensive disclosure about
your company. You'll be asked to verify
that the company is in good standing,
bas paid its taxes, and is in compliance
with all laws. You must also establish
that tbe company's financial statements
are correct and tbat it bas no agreements or contingent obligations otber
than tbose referred to in an attached
disclosure schedule. You sbould seek,
whenever possible, to narrow tbe scope
of tbese representations and qualify
them as being to tbe best of your
knowledge at the time. Inclusion of any
matter you think may apply will avoid
later argument by tbe VCs tbat you
failed to disclose relevant information.
It's a good idea to negotiate
for a cushion in your favor, so tbat if
there are omissions in your representations that later cost the company no
more tban, say, $50,000, tbe omissions
won't be considered a breach of tbe representation. In addition, ask for a time
limit on your representations about tbe
company-tbey should not apply for
more tban six montbs to a year after
the deal has been closed.

Cashing out the
investment
In any venture capital deal,
the VCs will be looking ahead to
the day wben tbey can liquidate tbeir
investment in your company. They'll
likely want provisions written into
tbe agreement that will give them tbe
opportunity to casb out on favorable
terms at a time of their choosing.

pay your registration expenses. If it
isn't, you will have to pay a proportionate share of what can be an enormous
bill-forlawyers, accountants, printers,
state securities filings, and underwriters' expenses. (Certain states will not
permit the company to pay insiders' registration expenses; if your underwriter
wants to offer stock in those states, you
may have to waive your registration
rights.)

can block a transaction crucial to the
company's survival, it's important to include a provision that allows the VCs'
rights to be changed. The VCs' rights
cannot be modified without their consent. Because you may have investments from a number of VCs, and you
may therefore not be able to get a unanimous decision, you should try to get
tbe VCs to agree in advance that a majority or two-thirds count of their combined interest can waive the VCs' rights
on behalf of all.

Liquidation and merger provisions. Provisions governing the liquidation or merger of your business are
important, yet they are often overlooked. If you are not careful, you may
unwittingly agree to a provision that
harms you or creates windfall gains for
the VCs in the event of a merger or other corporate combination.
If, for example, preferred
shareholders are allowed to treat a
merger like a liquidation, they can demand a cash payment at the time of the
merger. This kind of provision makes
the merger less appealing to a potential
partner. It can kill a deal outright, or at
least give the preferred shareholders
leverage to extract other concessionsusually at your expense.
Clauses relating to liquidation preferences should also get eareful
scrutiny. Liquidation preferences specify the order in which holders of different classes of securities get paid and
how much of the liquidation proceeds
they can collect before other investors
are repaid. Under some preference provisions, the VCs not only receive 100%
of their initial investment back but
also have the right to share in any remaining proceeds, as if the investment
consisted of common stock.
One risk to you of such a
provision is that the VCs may be better
off if the company liquidates than if it
remains in operation. While the company remains in business, the VCs can
only participate as either holders of
preferred stock or debt or holders of
common stock. On liquidation, they
can participate as both. Moreover, liquidation provisions don't apply just in
cases of failure, when there is nothing
left to distribute; companies are sometimes liquidated even when business is
good. And the VCs may control the decision whether to liquidate.

The key to weathering the
venture capital process is to put the
transaction in perspective. When it's
all over, your young and not particularly bankable company will have a large
sum of cash to put to work. Although
some things the VCs demand may
seem ridiculous, burdensome, or even
insulting, you can't expect to get that
amount of money without a lot of
strings attached - and some of the things
they make you do may even be good for
you.
Remember that even though
funding risky ventures is their business,
venture capitalists will do all tbey
can to avoid losing their capital. Expect
them to be tough negotiators.
But this doesn't mean that
you don't have the right to protect your
interests in the deal. You won't get
your way on every provision, but you
should be able to persuade the VCs to
see matters from your point of view on
some. The best strategy is to try to
fight any provisions that will keep you
from running your company effectively
or that are clearly unfair to you, and
not wrestle too hard over the others.
Your negotiations should be
guided by a spirit of fairness and respect for each other's legitimate interests. Properly handled, these negotiations can build a foundation of trust
and cooperation from the very startgiving your business the best possible
chance for success. ^
