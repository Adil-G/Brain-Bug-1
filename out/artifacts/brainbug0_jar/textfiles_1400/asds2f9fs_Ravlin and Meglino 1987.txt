Effect of Values on Perception and Decision Making: A Study of
Alternative Work Values Measures

Four alternative methods of measuring values were used to examine the impact of work values
on perception and decision-making tasks. Perception and its relation to values was assessed using
interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. The effect of values on decision making was evaluated using
within-subject regression analyses of 20 separate decisions. A total of 103 undergraduate subjects
completed values measures and the perceptual and decision-making tasks in three work sessions,
each separated by from 2 to 4 days. A rank order measure of values related more consistently to
perception and decision making than did other measurement methods. Results also provide some
support for a theory of values in which values affect perceptual organization and act as a guide to
decision making.

Values have traditionally played an important role in the understanding of job satisfaction, emotion (see Lazarus & Folk-

obvious concern is the relation of the nature of values to the

more complex conceptualization of values as possibly equal in

ALTERNATIVE WORK VALUES MEASURES

as the appropriate ones, is used almost exclusively in conjunction with this type of measure.
In addition to their cognitive organization, another conceptual aspect of values is inextricably linked to their measurement. Although there are different types of values, social values,
which are studied here, represent general modes of behavior
that an individual "should" or "ought" to exhibit (Fallding,
1965; Kluckhohn, 1951; Rokeach, 1973; Schein, 1985; Williams, 1968). This "oughtness" characteristic—perhaps the
most distinctive feature of these values—arises from the social
nature of the construct itself. Although all values may be initially established on the basis of experiences of pleasure and
pain (Locke, 1975), social values come to represent the efforts
of a social system (e.g., group, organization, society) to impose
concern for the welfare of the system as a whole on the actions
of its individual members (see Kluckhohn, 1951, for a discussion of this point). Thus, a society socializes individuals to value
"honesty" because it is important to the society as a whole that
individuals do not cheat or steal. Social values are, therefore,
phenomena that are highly socially desirable and, as such, tend
to be strongly endorsed by all individuals. This is another powerful argument for the use of an ipsative measurement model.
If a number of values are measured independently of each other,
scores for each of the values may be artificially inflated, reducing any differences between scores and making it difficult to predict behavior that involves a choice among values (e.g., whether
to strive to achieve success at the expense of helping others). It
may also be extremely difficult to separate what is essentially an
individual's endorsement of a socially desirable phenomenon
from what is an error caused by the respondent giving a socially
desirable response. Forced choice scales have been used to control in part for social desirability (Anastasi, 1982); however,
their use may create another problem. This type of measure
may fail to capture the essence of values themselves (i.e., social
desirability).
Another issue of critical importance concerns the impact of
values on individuals. Two distinct processes are thought to be
involved in linking values to choice behavior (England, 1967,
1975). One process, which has rarely been examined (for an
exception see Postman, Bruner, & McGinnies, 1948) concerns
perceptual organization. Values are thought to influence the selection and interpretation of external stimuli, thereby affecting
the organization of behavioral choices or the formulation of alternative courses of action. In addition to this indirect influence, values are thought to guide action in a direct manner by
influencing behavioral choice (e.g., Rokeach, 1973). Values,
therefore, should relate to the organization or interpretation of
stimuli as well as to actual decision-making behavior. Our study
examined these theoretical relationships by assessing the degree
to which subjects' values, as measured by various measurement
methods, related to their perceptions on a pseudorecognition
task and decisions on a judgment task. As with other central
constructs (see Epstein, 1979, 1980), values should predict
broad modes of behavior over time. Consequently, at any point
in time, the relation between values and perceptions on the
pseudorecognition task, and values and decisions on the judgment task, was expected to be somewhat weak.
The influence of values on perception and behavioral choice
may, however, be enhanced by situational moderators. For ex-

ample, prevalent social norms and situational uncertainty are
thought to be key elements influencing the perceptual and
choice processes. We investigated the impact of uncertainty in
the form of ambiguous stimuli and will discuss it ahead.
The final issue of importance to a study of values concerns
the number and type of values investigated. A large number of
values studies have considered only one value, which makes it
impossible to address the question of how a network of values
affects perception and decision making. It is also impossible to
examine whether measurement models should be hierarchical.
Thus, we examined a number of values that were chosen on the
basis of an earlier phase of this research. In that phase, Cornelius, Ullman, Meglino, Czajka, and McNeely (1985) used a
variant of Flanagan's (1954) critical incident technique in a survey of 966 employees at different levels in a variety of organizations throughout the United States. These employees completed a one-page questionnaire asking them to focus on an individual they knew well at work and to identify one value that
that person held about life in general. They were then asked to
describe an incident at work that illustrated why they felt that
the person held that particular value. These behavioral incidents were then sorted into separate value categories by six independent expert judges. The categories that accounted for a
substantial number of incidents (greater than 5% each) were as
follows; achievement (19.9%), concern for others (15.1%), honesty (11.6%), working hard (10.7%), positive outlook (10.7%),
helping others (10.0%), and fairness (5.8%). For the present
study, the achievement and working hard categories were combined (called achievement), as were the concern for others and
helping others categories (called helping). These two categories,
plus honesty and fairness, formed the basis for the values measured. The positive-outlook category was not included because
it was judged to be the least relevant to prior work values research.

Measures
Four alternative methods were used to measure the values
identified above. All of them used direct questions, as opposed
to alternative methods such as projective techniques (see Miner,
1977), or observation of action patterns. The measures consisted of a simple rank ordering of the four values (rank measure), assignment of a fixed number of points among the four
values (point-assignment measure), a forced-choice measure
based on a series of behavioral incidents related to each of the
four values (forced-choice measure), and ratings on item response scales of the same behavioral incidents (Likert-summated scales measure). The Likert measure, because it allowed
values to be measured independently of each other, was nonipsative and therefore contained no control for social desirability.
The rank, point-assignment, and forced-choice measures were
purely ipsative and provided some control for socially desirable
responses. Note, however, that these techniques do not necessarily eliminate such bias. For example, Anastasi (1982) observed that forced-choice measures, in particular, may only partially eliminate the effects of social desirability.
To evaluate each measurement method in terms of its susceptibility to the effects of social desirability response bias, we collected scores on the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale

<-----Page 2----->668

(Crowne & Marlowe, 1964). We also used two commonly used
measures of single values to gain further information concerning the construct validity of the measures. The Pro-Protestant
Ethic subscale (Blood, 1969) indicates the degree to which a
person believes that individual worth is the result of work or
achievement in the work domain, whereas CrandalTs (1975) Social Interest Scale (SIS; Crandall, 1977; Crandall & Harris,
1976) measures interest in and concern for others.

Hypotheses
Predictions were made regarding the relation of the various
values measures to perception, decision making, response bias,
and other measures. They are stated as the following hypotheses:
1. Subjects' responses on the ranking, point-assignment, and
forced-choice measures will be related to the frequency with
which they interpret ambiguous stimuli as representing the four
value categories on a perceptual task. Because value schemas
actively influence perception and interpretation, stimuli will be
more likely to be interpreted as indicating more dominant values. The influence of social desirability response bias should
reduce the relation between Likert scale responses and frequency responses.
2. Subjects' responses on the ranking, point-assignment, and
forced-choice values measures will relate positively to the
weights they place on the values in making a decision. Behavioral channelling by values should influence subjects to make
decisions in a manner congruent with their values. The relation
between decision weights and Likert scale responses will be
affected by social desirability response bias and therefore is not
predicted to be significant.
3. Responses on the Likert measure will be more highly related to responses on the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability
Scale than will responses on rank, point-assignment, and
forced-choice measures. Although ranking, point-assignment,
or forced-choice methods provide control for an individual's desire to appear socially attractive, Likert items allow responses
to be inflated.
4. Subjects' orderings of achievement should relate positively to their score on the Blood Pro-Protestant Ethic subscale.
Subjects who rate achievement high, as compared with helping,
honesty, and fairness, should score higher on the Pro-Protestant
Ethic subscale. This relation should be stronger for the ranking,
point-assignment, and forced-choice measures than for the Likert measure because social desirability response bias will affect
Likert scale responses.
5. Subjects' orderings of helping should relate positively to
their score on CrandalTs SIS. Subjects who rate helping high, as
compared with achievement, honesty, and fairness, should
score higher on the SIS. This relation should be stronger for the
ranking, point-assignment, and forced-choice measures than
for the Likert measure because social desirability response bias
will affect Likert scale responses.

Method
Development of Values Instruments
Development of the forced-choice, Likert, rank, and point-assignment methods is described in this section.

Forced-choice measure. For each of the four value categories, representative behavioral incidents were selected from those gathered by Cornelius et al. (1985). These incidents were edited into single-sentence
items describing a specific behavior (e.g., achievement: "doing whatever
work is required to advance in your career"). Additional items were also
written to generate 25 items for each value. These items were developed
by substitution of synonyms, changes in referent and intensity, and
shifts in gender emphasis in the original behavioral incidents. The 100
items were then rated for desirability and for the extent to which each
represented the value category in question. This was accomplished using two separate surveys, each administered to a different group of undergraduate students.
In the first survey, we asked 100 students to rate the desirability of
each item on a 5-point scale, ranging from not desirable (1) to highly
desirable (5). This was done to obtain statements matched in desirability for the forced-choice measure. Choosing between two equally desirable behaviors should control for most bias toward socially acceptable
responding. In the second survey, we asked a separate group of 99 students to indicate on a 5-point scale, ranging from not al all ( I ) to to a
very great extent (5), the extent to which each item related to a specific
definition of its value category. This survey was taken to ensure that
only items that were representative of then" value category to the subject
population were included in the forced-choice measure.
On the basis of these surveys, 48 items were selected for inclusion in
the forced-choice values questionnaire. Of these items, 31.25% were
from the original behavioral incidents and 68.75% were generated for
this study, modeled on the original incidents. To be selected, an item
had to receive an average rating of 3.5, or above, on the extent to which
it reflected its value category (3 = to a moderate extent). In addition,
no items were included that received significantly different responses
on social desirability from men and women. This second criterion was
imposed to eliminate sex bias in the resulting survey. The final, and
most stringent, criterion for selection was that each item had to pair
with another item representing a different value, such that there existed
no significant difference between the items in social desirability.
The resulting questionnaire contained 24 equally desirable pairs of
items. Desirability ratings appear in Table 1. Each item in a pair reflected one of the four different values. Pairing was done systematically
such that a different item reflecting a particular value appeared in 12
pairings. The questionnaire asked subjects to indicate, on a 9-point
scale, how much emphasis they should place on one item in each pair
as opposed to the other item in the pair. Because each item was scored
at the expense of the other in the pair, this forced-choice questionnaire
yielded purely ipsative scores.
Liken measure. A second questionnaire was also constructed on the
basis of the same items contained in the forced-choice questionnaire
described earlier. In this questionnaire, each of the 48 individual items
was evaluated on a 5-point scale, ranging from never ( 1 ) lo always (5)
that reflected how often the respondent should engage in each of the
behaviors described. Because each item was rated independently of the
others, scores on this questionnaire were not ipsative in nature.
Rank and point-assignment measures. We developed two additional
values measures for this study. In the first, we provided subjects with a
definition of each value (the same definitions originally used to evaluate
the extent to which each item related to its specific value) and asked
them to rank the values according to how they felt each should be emphasized in their behavior (1 = greatest emphasis). This format is very
similar to one used by Rokeach (1973). In the second measure, we provided subjects with the same value definitions but asked them to allocate
a total of 25 "points" across all four values according to how they felt
each should be emphasized in their behavior (more points = greater
emphasis).
The procedures we have described yielded four different measures of
the same four values: a forced-choice questionnaire that asked respon-

dents to indicate their relative emphasis between 24 pairs of behavioral
statements, a Liken questionnaire that allowed independent ratings of
48 behavioral statements according to how often the behavior should be
performed, a rank ordering of the four values, and a point allocation
among the four values. The forced-choice, rank, and point-assignment
measures are purely ipsative, whereas the Liken measure is nonipsative.
Because it is inappropriate to use ipsative scores for intersubject comparisons, the Likerl scores were treated as ipsative scores for purposes
of comparison with the other methods of measuring values.
The instructions for each of the measures asked subjects to respond
in terms of the way they felt they should or ought to behave, rather than
asking for actual behavior or for an endorsement of phrases or adjectives
as most other values measures do. This method is consistent with the
commonly accepted definition of social values. It is also consistent with
the expectation that values, as central constructs, should be relatively
stable, should predict broad modes of behavior over time, and should
have a relatively weak relation to a specific behavior at a given point in
time.

Subjects and Procedures
Subjects for this study were 103 undergraduate students recruited
from junior- and senior-level management courses, who participated for
extra credit. Subjects participated in three 45-min data-gathering sessions, each separated by from 2 to 4 days. Questionnaire data were gathered during the first two sessions, which were counterbalanced to control for order effects. At one session, the forced-choice. Protestant Ethic
Scale, point-assignment, and SIS measures were administered. At the

other session, the Likert, Marlowe-Crowne, and rank measures were
collected. The perceptual and decision criterion tasks were both completed during the third session and are described next.
Perceptual task. The first criterion task was a pseudorecognition exercise that has been used in a number of other studies (Cottrell, Wack,
Sekerak, & Rittle, 1968; Henchy & Glass, 1968; Zajonc & Nieuwenhuyse, 1964;Zajonc&Sales, 1966) to assess an individual's hierarchical
ordering of responses. A series of 25 nonsense words were flashed on a
screen using a Gerbrands Model 300-C digital millisecond timer and a
Gerbrands Model 66 shutter. The shutter speed was set, on the basis of
pretests, such that subjects were unable to recognize the actual word.
They were told that although they would not actually see the word, their
minds would absorb its subliminal image. They were then asked to guess
at the value category that was most closely related to each word. In
prior studies, responses corresponded to the relative dominance of the
concepts in a subject's cognitive hierarchy. The actual number of
guesses a subject made in a value category was recorded as the frequency
score for that value.
Decision task. The second criterion task required subjects to simulate a manager in making 20 separate overall evaluation decisions, ranging from outstanding (1) to poor (7), for 20 fictitious employees on the
basis of each employee's work record. Each work record was presented
in the form of a profile that contained an indication of the employee's
performance on four dimensions corresponding to each of the four values of interest, using the same 7-point scale, ranging from outstanding
(1) to poor (7), that subjects were to use in their overall evaluation. Subjects were told that the ratings had been provided by a supervisor and
that these ratings should form the basis of the overall evaluation. Thus,
the task provided a simulation of a common managerial activity, evaluating employees, using ratings provided by others. The value ratings
were systematically varied across the fictitious profiles so that subjects
evaluated profiles representing all possible combinations of high (2 =
substantially above average) and low (5 = slightly below average) performance on the value dimensions (16 profiles) plus 4 duplicate profiles.
For example, a subject would evaluate an individual who had obtained
a rating of 2 on fairness, 2 on honesty, 5 on helping, and 2 on achievement. This procedure provided complete independence between independent variable ratings for the 16 unique profiles, thus aiding valueweight interpretation. (Including the duplicate profiles resulted in interrating correlations ranging between —.1 and .1, with a median value
of 0.) Within-subject regression analysis was then used to estimate the
emphasis each subject placed on each value in making his or her evaluation. The independent variables entering these equations were the four
value ratings assigned by the researchers to each of the 20 fictitious employees. The dependent variable was the subject's overall evaluation.
The four standardized beta weights obtained for each subject indicated
the emphasis placed on each of the four values by the subject in making
the overall evaluation.
Results
Because the ipsative nature of most of the data precludes use
of the usual between-subject statistics, we compared rank orderings of the values as produced by the measuring instruments
and criterion procedures (the perceptual and decision tasks).
To obtain appropriate within-subject rankings from the Likert
measure, we adjusted subject's scores to compensate for the relative differences in mean responses across the four values for
this population. Specifically, the score for each subject on each
value was adjusted by the mean of the population on that particular value to provide a standard scale of response. This procedure corrected the ordering of within-subject ranks on the basis
of responses of the population under study by equating acrosssubject means for all four values.

this scale, was more likely to be ordered as less important for
those subjects scoring below the median split on the Pro-Protes-

examining different patterns of responses. High and low scorers
on the Marlowe-Crowne were compared for differences in the
frequency with which they chose achievement, honesty, fairness, and helping as their first or second priority, versus third or

as more socially desirable than the others, high scorers on the

the rank measure give the overall best performance against the
criteria, it is the simplest and least time consuming for both the
subject and the researcher. The point-assignment method also
performed very well overall, whereas the forced-choice measure
did less well, possibly because its complexity was less congruent
with the simple perceptual and decision tasks presented here.
These findings unfortunately leave us with the problem of the
analytic limitations of ipsative measures. An important challenge for future research is to rigorously question the hierarchical model of values and the issue of whether individuals maintain stable preference orderings over time. This conceptualization is one primary rationale for the ipsative measurement
model. If it does not hold up under scrutiny, other means of
controlling response bias should be devised to eliminate the
need for ipsative measurement.
Establishment of a nomological network for values measures
is an interactive process, which requires that both measurement
and theory be investigated simultaneously (McGrath, 1982);
thus, we believe that the research reported here also provides
some positive support for work values theory. Findings indicate
that an individual's values are related to his or her cognitive
organization. Subjects were given no reason to believe that their
primary value would appear any more often than the other val-

the various tasks was chosen to separate in time as far as was
possible the items most subject to this effect (ranks and point
assignments). Other tasks were designed such that a subject
should either have no reason to be consistent (the perceptual
task) or should have difficulty in attempting to consciously control consistency (the forced-choice measure and the decision
task). An additional problem is that the sample used here, undergraduate students, is not ideal; however, the length of the
comparative procedure and the need for research into cognitive
organization precluded use of a working sample. Research on a
working sample would certainly help to support the results
found here.
This study suggests many paths for future research. Perhaps
the most important of these is to study the impact of values on
individual processes. Further exploration of the relation between values, decision making, and behavior is needed both in
the field and under more controlled conditions over longer time
periods. This should include commonly used dependent variables such as satisfaction and commitment, as well as the central variables considered here. The use of multiple methods for
purposes of triangulation is particularly advocated, given the
moderately good performance of three of the values measures
examined here. Finally, the initial establishment of evidence re-

them that they should somehow be consistent with questionnaires they had filled out days earlier. In effect, this was a very
stringent criterion inasmuch as interpretation was at a purely
subconscious level. Despite these conditions, subjects tended to
"recognize" words as belonging to a value category with frequencies corresponding to their value hierarchies. This finding
gives some support for the notion that values are indeed hierarchically organized in memory, and strongly suggests that people
will find opportunities, within the context of their duties, to apply their dominant value in uncertain situations. That is, these
people are likely to perceive the implications for that value in
situations that may be interpreted in multiple ways. An organization that desires to promote a cooperative climate, for example, should therefore prefer to employ individuals who could
