This study uses theoretically justified criteria from the industrial organization (IO) strategy literature and applies it to a new domain, namely, venture
capitalists’ decision making. Specifically, the study investigates the types of
information venture capitalists utilize when evaluating new ventures and
how venture capitalists use this information to assess likely new venture
profitability. In the interest of advancing our understanding of the decision
making policies of venture capitalists, this study addresses many of the limitations of previous research.
A review of IO research suggests important relationships between a number of strategy variables
and new venture profitability. Some of the relationships proposed by IO strategy research are contingent
in nature. The strategy variables and their relationships with profitability are investigated in the domain of
venture capitalists’ decision making. Individual and aggregate decision making analyses identified those
strategy variables (criteria) venture capitalists utilize in assessing likely new venture profitability, namely,
timing, key success factor stability, lead time, competitive rivalry, educational capability, industry-related
competence, timing ⫻ key success factor stability interaction, timing ⫻ lead time interaction, and timing ⫻
educational capability interaction.
On average, the most important criterion for venture capitalists in their assessment of profitability is
industry-related competence. The second tier of importance is competitive rivalry, timing, and educational
capability. The third tier of importance is lead time, key success factor stability, and timing ⫻ lead time

interaction. Other interactions are less important. Therefore, while venture capitalists use contingent decision policies, main effects dominate. If venture capitalists use a reported 8 to 12 minutes on average to
evaluate a business plan (Sandberg 1986), then this study’s findings may help the inexperienced venture
capitalist allocate time towards assessing those attributes of primary importance. Although more complex
relationships exist between the attributes, the inexperienced venture capitalist can take comfort from this
study’s findings that main effects dominant amongst senior venture capitalists. Senior venture capitalists
may take less comfort from their importance placed on main effects in light of research from IO, which
suggests the importance of contingent relationships. The results may also have practical application towards training.
How should venture capital firms train their new employees? Should venture capital firms rely solely
on experienced venture capitalists lecturing the inexperienced on the criteria they use in assessing a new
venture proposal? Like most decision makers, venture capitalists have limited insight into their assessments and venture capital firms need to be aware of the gap between “espoused” policies and policies “in
use.” The information being taught needs to be supplemented with venture capitalists’ decision-making
research that investigates decision policies “in use”, such as this study. Venture capitalist training could
also involve experiential learning, in conjunction with cognitive feedback about the decision policies used,
to accelerate the learning process. Experiential learning using cognitive feedback maximizes industry
related learning while minimizing the cost of inexperienced decisions. For the entrepreneur seeking capital, this increased understanding of venture capitalists’ decision making may help them better target their
business plans and presentations at those criteria venture capitalists’ find most critical to the profitability
of a new venture.  2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

INTRODUCTION
The management literature is replete with studies that have investigated strategic decision making from a range of perspectives, from a resource based view (Barney 1991;
Wernerfelt 1984) to industrial organization (Porter 1981; Wernerfelt and Montgomery
1988) to strategy process (Mintzberg 1978; Chakravarthy and Doz 1992). One area of
strategy research that has been relatively under-researched (regardless of the perspective used), is venture capitalists’ assessment of a new venture’s strategy.1
To date, the assessment of strategy by this group of professionals has been the focus
in only a small number of studies (see Sandberg and Hofer 1987; Hall and Hofer 1993).
This is surprising for two reasons. First, venture capitalists generally are thought to be
successful at predicting new venture performance. Accordingly, there may be broad
strategic benefits gleaned from a better understanding of their decision processes. Second, growth in today’s economy, both domestically and abroad, is driven to a large extent by the success of new businesses (Timmons 1994, Vesper 1990). It is well understood
that start up capital to fund and grow these ventures (i.e., conduct R&D, initiate production, expand manufacturing facilities, build reputation) is critical to their success. The
venture capitalist is often the key gatekeeper in the funding process and their impact
on fueling economic growth is likely to increase as the entrepreneurial spirit drives our
global economy into the 21st century.
The purpose of this study is to investigate and advance our understanding of the
decision-making policies of venture capitalists.
Specifically, this research addresses two related questions: (1) what types of information do venture capitalists’ utilize when evaluating a new venture’s strategy, specifi1

In the context of this study, a new venture is a firm seeking seed, startup or development capital.

<-----Page 2----->NEW VENTURE STRATEGY

451

cally, their assessments of likely new venture profitability, a key decision area;2 and (2)
how do venture capitalists’ use this information; i.e., what is the relative importance
of a new venture’s attributes when assessing profitability and to what extent do venture
capitalists employ contingent (interactive) decision policies in their assessments?
The present study represents a significant departure from previous work in two
important ways, one theoretical, the other methodological. First, prior research into
venture capitalists’ decision making typically has relied on empirically generated criteria. This study uses an industrial organization perspective of strategy and investigates
it in a new domain, namely, venture capitalists decision making. The industrial organization approach to strategy has both controversial (relatively conclusive) and non-controversial (relatively inconclusive) findings about the relationship between strategy variables and firm performance. This study utilizes those non-controversial findings from IO
that we ‘know’ influence performance and see if venture capitalists use these variables
(criteria) in the manner proposed in the literature. Strategy variables more controversial
in nature are held constant.
Specifically, for two of the criteria, only main effects are proposed and the direction
of the effect is specified. The effects for the remaining four criteria are expected to be
interactive (i.e., contingent) and the nature and direction of the interaction is specified.
The methodological departure from previous research is the use here of conjoint
analysis to derive the decision policies of venture capitalists. This technique represents
a multivariate analytical approach that is predicated on the assumption that the decision
process involves the evaluation and integration of information on multiple factors or
attributes. In contrast, to the methods typically used in previous studies, the conjoint
approach has the advantage of being better able to capture the complexity of venture
capitalists’ decision making. To date, only two known studies have used conjoint analysis to investigate the decision making of venture capitalists (i.e., Muzyka, Birley, and
Leleux 1996; Zacharakis and Meyer 1998).3 Although each of these studies have made
a contribution to the field of venture capitalist decision making, neither of these studies
investigate possible contingent relationships (i.e., interactions) between variables.
The IO strategy literature is now reviewed and hypotheses developed.

STRATEGY: AN INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION PERSPECTIVE
Most IO research into the strategies of new ventures, indicates that timing of entry into
a market or industry is a key factor for success (Lieberman and Montgomery 1988;
Mitchell 1991; Golder and Tellis, 1993; Lambkin 1988). There is general consensus that,
although the risk of failure is greater for early entrants (Aaker and Day 1986; Nelson
and Winter 1982; Mitchell 1991; Wernerfelt and Karnani 1987), they enjoy higher returns than their later counterparts (Schumpeter 1975; MacMillan, Siegal and SubbaNarasimha 1985; DeCastro and Chrisman 1995).
Although the critical role played by timing is not in dispute, its importance relative
to other key decision criteria is less well understood. The literature in IO strategy provides evidence that a number of additional entry strategy variables are likely to mitigate
the role of timing which, in turn, affects profitability. These additional variables include:
2
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) found venture capitalists’ investment decisions can be predicted, in part,
from their perceptions of likely return. Return is most often evaluated by venture capitalists in terms of profitability (e.g., Robinson 1987; Robinson and Pearce 1984; Roure and Keeley 1990).

key success factor stability, educational capability, pioneer’s lead time, competitive rivalry, scope of entry, mechanisms of entry, and industry-related competence. The proposed relationship between timing of entry, other entry strategy variables and profitability is shown in Figure 1.
Although the strategy literature points to the likely role played by these variables,
previous venture capital research appears to be limited in that each variable has been
investigated in isolation from each other; i.e., studies into venture capitalists’ decision
making hypothesize and empirically test ‘main effect only’ models. As such, we propose
these studies may have failed to capture the complexity of the new venture decision,
which, as stated earlier, presumably is the result of the evaluation and combination of
multiple variables with moderating influences. Conjoint analysis is used here to address
this concern and enables the simultaneous presentation of multiple decision criteria.
The nature of the relationship between the entry strategy variables and new venture
performance is discussed next and a series of hypotheses derived from the strategy literature are presented.

Key Success Factor Stability
Requirements for market success are likely to change radically with market evolution
(Abell 1978). Superior performance arises from a fit between the key success requirements and the competencies of a venture (Andrews 1987). And while pioneers commit
to a number of key factors they believe will lead to success within the competitive environment (Slater 1993), changes in that environment may render the venture at a competitive disadvantage (Abell 1978; Aaker and Day, 1986). Later followers are often better
able to recognize and respond to market opportunities as well as minimize costs of entry
through cutting R&D corners and/or leapfrogging the pioneering technology (Yip
1982). However, if key success factors within an industry are likely to remain stable,

<-----Page 4----->NEW VENTURE STRATEGY

453

it is proposed that a pioneer’s early commitment to, and strategy for, a new technology
will provide superior new venture performance. The above discussion leads to three
related hypotheses:
H1A: The key success factor stability of a new venture moderates the relationship
between timing and venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability.
H1B: If key success factor stability is high, venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability increases with earlier entry;
H1C: If key success factor stability is low, venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability decreases with earlier entry.

Lead Time
Barriers to entry initially provide pioneers with a period of monopoly. The lead-time
between the pioneer’s entry into the market and the appearance of the first follower, at
least initially, delays competitive rivalry within the industry. Lead time and competitive
rivalry, in tandem, provide a greater understanding of new venture performance by
identifying how an advantage is first obtained and the means by which over time it slowly
erodes. A longer lead time may increase pioneering advantages by helping the pioneer
establish an even stronger brand name (Schmalensee 1982) and enabling the venture
to move customers’ ideal points closer to the pioneer’s attribute mix (Carpenter and
Nakamoto 1989).
Further, increasing lead time provides pioneers with the opportunity to broaden
their product line (Robinson and Fornell 1985), and can return superior profits to the
venture which enables them to better prepare for new battles (Porter 1980). Longer
lead times also provide an opportunity to increase share while charging premium prices.
The pioneer may also achieve cost advantages in the short- and long-run via the experience curve (Abell and Hammond 1979). These cost advantages have the effect of putting
later entrants at a distinct competitive disadvantage. Pioneers may also be able to erect
barriers that virtually lock out followers (Porter 1980), further increasing lead time and
its commensurate advantages. Therefore, the market momentum supported by lead
time helps pioneers maintain significant advantages. However, if lead time is short, there
is less opportunity to fully develop and exploit these advantages which, of course, diminishes the advantages of early entry. Hence, it is argued that venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability increases with earlier entry. Further, this increase will vary as a
function of lead time. Specifically, we propose the following hypotheses:
H2A: The length of a pioneer’s lead time moderates the relationship between timing
and venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability.
H2B: Profitability increases with earlier entry at a greater rate for long lead time
than short lead time. For pioneers, venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability is
higher for a longer lead time.
H2C: For late entrants, venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability is higher for
a shorter lead time.

<-----Page 5----->454

Competitive Rivalry
Competitive intensity usually reduces overall industry profitability (Porter 1980; Slater
1993) while concurrently reducing pioneering advantages developed through lead time.
In other words, competition can quickly erode any advantages gained by a pioneer and
creates pressures to respond both strategically and tactically. Often this will result in
a reduction in prices and, in turn, profitability. In contrast, when competitive rivalry
is low, the pioneering advantages developed during lead time are likely to be more sustainable. Thus:
H3: Venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability is significantly higher for lower
levels of competitive rivalry than for higher levels of competitive rivalry.

Educational Capability
There is often considerable uncertainty about the rate at which customers will substitute
new technology for old (Porter 1980). A pioneer’s potential customers often lack a
frame of reference for understanding a new product concept and its benefits (Slater
1993). A frame of reference needs to be constructed in order to encourage new thinking
and substitution on the part of potential customers. They need to be informed and persuaded that the benefits of purchase are greater than the risks (Slater 1993; Rogers
1983). In terms of time, as well as financial and human resources, a customer’s frame
of reference can be difficult and costly to alter. However if a venture already possesses
these resources, it is said to have educational capability, i.e., the skills, knowledge and
resources that new ventures may effectively apply to both market research and market
development (Stinchcombe 1965). Ventures with high educational capability have a
marked advantage in hastening customer substitution (Slater 1993; Rogers 1983),
thereby increasing industry and firm profitability (Porter 1980). Accordingly, the following relationships are hypothesized:
H4A: The educational capability of a new venture moderates the relationship between timing and venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability.
H4B: For ventures with high educational capability, venture capitalists’ assessment
of profitability increases with earlier entry.
H4C: For ventures with low educational capability, venture capitalists’ assessment
of profitability decreases with earlier entry. Venture capitalists’ assessment of
profitability will be greater for ventures with high educational capability than ventures with low educational capability.

Industry-related Competence
Success is more likely to be achieved by those entering an industry in which the experience of the management team is relevant to the endeavor (Vesper 1990; Roure and
Madique 1985; de Koning and Muzyka 1996). Roure and Maidique (1985) found successful founders of start-up firms had related backgrounds in rapid growth firms that
often competed in the same industry. Opportunities are likely to be less clear and may
not be fully exploited by the uninitiated or may occur too rapidly to be grasped and
capitalized on by industry “outsiders”. As argued by Feeser and Willard (1990), founders of successful new ventures must possess the requisite skills a priori. Thus:

<-----Page 6----->NEW VENTURE STRATEGY

455

H5: Venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability is significantly higher for ventures with high industry-related competence than for ventures with low industryrelated competence.

Control Variables: Scope and Entry Wedge
The above review and hypotheses apply non-controversial findings from the IO strategy
literature to venture capitalists’ decision making. However, the literature also points
towards a number of variables (e.g., a new venture’s choice of scope and entry mechanism) which appear important although the relationship between those variables and
profitability is not clear. Much of the conventional wisdom of the earlier strategy literature advised ventures to pursue narrow or focused strategies (e.g., Low and MacMillan
1988). More recent studies, however, utilizing large databases (such as PIMS) suggest
that new ventures that are both more broad and more aggressive than incumbents display superior performance (e.g., Biggadike 1976; Tsai, MacMillan, and Low 1991). Although questions of scope may be central to the development of new venture strategy,
there exists controversy in the literature on the relationship between scope and profitability. Scope is held constant in this study.
Further, Lieberman and Montgomery (1988) argue that researchers should focus
on the evaluation of specific entry mechanisms, rather than on the more general construct of timing of entry. Vesper’s (1990) notion of “entry wedges” addresses Lieberman
and Montgomery’s (1988) concern. Entry wedges are defined as competitive weapons
that may be used by a venture focusing on entering an industry. However, the relationship between a new venture’s entry wedge and profitability is not well established in
the IO literature. Therefore, this variable is held constant.

RESEARCH METHOD
The Decision Making Task
This study uses conjoint analysis to model the decision strategies of venture capitalists
and their use of various entry strategy variables when evaluating the profitability of new
ventures. Conjoint analysis and policy capturing have been used in hundreds of studies
of judgment and decision making (Stewart 1988; Green and Sirinivasan 1990). These
studies vary from research into consumer purchase decisions (Lang and Crown 1993),
manager’s strategic decisions (Priem 1994; Hitt and Tyler 1991) and expert judgment
(Davis 1996). For example, Bonner (1990) used conjoint analysis and found experience
played a significant role in an auditor’s assessment of risk.4 Shepherd and Zacharakis
(1997) propose conjoint analysis can provide significant insight into venture capitalists’
decision policies.
In developing the conjoint profiles extensive consultation was held with venture
capitalists, accountants, and academics to insure that the attributes and levels chosen
4
Auditors are professionals that rely on their expertise to make assessments about a business’ performance. In many ways this is similar to a venture capitalist assessing a business plan. While venture capitalists’
assessments may be more difficult and involve a different set of skills, current studies into expert judgment
provide evidence that conjoint analysis is a useful tool for researching expert judgment and is able to differentiate between levels of expertise in complex tasks. The method and profiles used in this present study are similar
in structure as those used in Bonner (1990), Davis (1996), and many other conjoint/policy capturing studies
from varied academic disciplines.

represented the variation that typically occurs in the decision environment of venture
capitalists, thereby enriching the overall believability (i.e., face validity) of the task. The
dependent variable, “profitability” was defined as “net profit on sales, using a 10-year
time horizon”. An 11-point Likert-type scale was used and anchored by the end points
“Very High Profitability” and “Very Low Profitability.” Ten years was chosen as the
time horizon because it captures Biggadike (1976) and others’ (e.g., McDougall, Covin,
Robinson, and Herron 1994) recommendation of eight or more years to define sustainable success of a venture.5

Attributes and Attribute Levels
Venture capitalists evaluated a series of conjoint profiles that described new ventures
based on eight attributes. The attributes and their corresponding levels are shown in
Table 1 and a sample profile is displayed in Appendix A. Each of the attributes is varied
at two levels in a 28 fractional factorial design consisting of 16 profiles (Hahn and Shapiro
1966). The fractional factorial design allowed each main effect and selected two way
interactions to be tested. Two-way interactions between timing of entry and each of
the other variables (with the exception of industry-related competence) was investigated. Each of the 16 profiles were fully replicated. These 32 profiles were randomly
assigned to avoid order effects, with a further practice profile and six hold out profiles used. The practice profile familiarized respondents with the task and the six
hold-out profiles were used to test the model’s predictive ability.6 In total, 39 profiles
were evaluated.

Participants
The study participants were Australian venture capitalists. Two comprehensive sources
for the Australian Venture Capital industry—the1996 Australian Venture Capital
Guide (Polliticon 1996) and the 1995 Australian Development Capital Directory (Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology 1995)—were used to identify
potential firms and venture capitalists to participate in the study. Selected characteristics
of the Australian Venture Capital industry are detailed in Appendix B. Australianbased firms listed in either guide with preferred investments in seed, start up, and/or
development capital were considered as the study sampling frame. Each firm in the sampling frame was targeted for study.
Venture capitalists participated via one of two contact methods: (1) the conjoint
decision- making task was administered by the first author at the venture capitalist’s
office; or (2) the decision-making task was administered by mail. For logistical reasons,
only those venture capitalists located in the central business districts of Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane (Australia’s three largest cities) were administered by the author.
Sixty-six venture capitalists representing 47 venture capital firms completed the
5
Venture capitalists often look to cash out of a business within five to eight years (Timmons 1994).
Venture capitalists’ capital gain is based on the value of the business at the time of exit. The value of the
business is dependent upon the future cash flows extending beyond exit (Shepherd and Douglas, in press).
Therefore, venture capitalists typically want to invest in businesses that have sustainable profitability. The
results of this study are not expected to differ between the use of an 8-year or 10-year time horizon as it
appears reasonable to assume both represent sustainable performance.
6
The models of venture capitalists ‘in use’ policies are derived from regression analysis, i.e., a constant
and a beta coefficients for each of the six criteria.

The final sample of 64 is comprised mostly of senior venture capitalists; 52% represent
Directors, Managing Directors, Executive Chairmen, General Managers, and CEOs of
their respective firms; senior managers constitute a further 42% with only 6% of the
sample accounted for by analysts. Table 2 details further characteristics of the sample.
Venture capitalists took between 30 and 45 minutes to complete the survey.
Analysis of variance performed on the regression (␤) coefficients and individual

Consequently, all subsequent analyses were performed on the data aggregated from

(Patell, 1976; Dechow, Huson, and Sloan, 1994).7 The mean regression coefficient of
the main effects found to be significant were interpreted by the sign of the coefficient.
To interpret the form of significant interactions, the means were averaged. Hay’s (1973)
omega squared (␻2), a measure of explained variance, was used to assess the relative
importance of the eight attributes and all testable two-way interactions. The marginal
means corresponding to all main effects and selected two-way interactions were
also calculated.
Predictive ability of individual and aggregate decision-making models were tested
using a Pearson R correlation between the observed score on six hold-out profiles and
a predicted score calculated by the decision model(s). Pearson R correlations were also
used to assess the decision-making consistency (i.e., test-retest reliability) of venture
capitalist’s responses on the 16 replicated profiles.

RESULTS
Individual Level Analyses
Analyses at the individual level reveals the strategy variables significant most often for
each of the 64 venture capitalists in their assessment of new venture profitability were,
in order: industry-related competence, educational capability, competitive rivalry, and
timing. Industry-related competence was significant for 54 of 64 venture capitalists
(84%), followed by educational capability (48%), competitive rivalry (44%), and timing
(38%). Key success factor stability, lead time, mimicry, and scope were each significant
less frequently: 27%, 25%, 19%, and 18%, respectively.
Analysis of contingent effects reveals timing’s interaction with lead time was significant for 11 of 64 venture capitalists (17%), whereas timing interacts with the other

attributes less often. Timing’s interaction with both educational capability and competitive rivalry were significant for 11% of the sample while timing’s interaction with key
success factor stability were significant for 5% of respondents.
Eighty-eight percent of the individual models of venture capitalists’ assessments
of profitability explained a significant proportion of the variance in their decision making. The mean test retest correlation on the 16 replicated profiles across all 64 venture
capitalists was 0.62 (p ⬍ 0.05). This relatively high level of judgmental consistency is
typical of experienced or expert decision makers (Krogstads, Ettenson, and Shanteau,
1984). Sixty-three percent of individual models had significant predictive ability and a
mean R2 of 0.68.

Aggregate Level Analyses
At the aggregate level, Table 3 indicates that all attributes had a significant effect (Z ⬎
1.645) on venture capitalists’ decision making. The mean regression coefficient for each
significant main effect was negative. This indicates that venture capitalists associate
higher profitability with: high industry-related competence, low competitive rivalry,
high educational capability, high key success factor stability, long lead time, and pioneering. The direction of these findings is consistent with expectations.
As demonstrated in Table 3 all hypothesized interactions reached significance (p ⬍
05): timing ⫻ key success factor stability, timing ⫻ lead time, and timing ⫻ educational
capability. A mean was derived from the individual results to interpret the form of these
interactions. The form of timing ⫻ key success factor stability interaction indicates that
if key success factor stability is high, VCs’ assessment of profitability increases with earlier entry (pioneer 5.39, late follower 4.62). This supports hypothesis 1b. If key success
factor stability is low, VCs’ assessment of profitability decreases with earlier entry (late
follower 4.13, pioneer 4.62). This supports hypothesis 1c.
The form of the timing ⫻ lead time interaction indicates that for pioneers, VCs’
assessment of profitability is higher for a long lead time (5.43) than a short lead time
(4.58). This finding supports hypothesis 2b. For late entrants, VCs’ assessment of profitability is higher for a long lead time (4.58) than a short lead time (4.32). This is in the
opposite direction to that hypothesized in 2c.
The form of the timing ⫻ educational capability interaction indicates that for ven-

<-----Page 11----->460

tures with high educational capability, VCs’ assessment of profitability increases with
earlier entry (late follower 4.85, pioneer 5.61). This provides support for hypothesis 4b.
For ventures with low educational capability, VCs’ assessment of profitability increases
with earlier entry (late follower 3.89 pioneer 4.41). This is in the opposite direction to
that hypothesized in 4c.
Although two or more attributes may significantly affect the decision process of
venture capitalists, it is unlikely that those attributes will be of equal importance in their
evaluative strategies. Therefore, statistical significance of the attributes is supplemented
with a measure of their relative importance. Hay’s omega squared (␻2) revealed that
the most important criteria for venture capitalists in their assessment of profitability
is industry-related competence. On average, this attribute accounted for 20% of the
variance in venture capitalist decision making (␻2 ⫽ 0.20). In the second tier of importance is competitive rivalry (␻2 ⫽ 0.09), timing (␻2 ⫽ 0.09) and educational capability
(␻2 ⫽ 0.08). Lead time (␻2 ⫽ 0.04), key success factor stability (␻2 ⫽ 0.03) and
timing ⫻ lead time interaction (␻2 ⫽ 0.02) comprise the third tier of importance. Of
least importance are the other estimable interactions (␻2 ⫽ 0.01).
The aggregate model was able to significantly predict the decisions of 64% of the
venture capitalists with a mean R2 of 0.74.

Summary of Findings
The study’s findings provide support for 9 of 11 hypotheses. Main effects in the expected
direction were found for competitive rivalry (hypothesis 3) and industry-related competence (hypothesis 5) and all parts of the contingency hypothesis for key success factor
stability (hypothesis 1a, 1b, and 1c). Support was also found for contingent decision
models for lead time (hypotheses 2a and 2b) and educational capability (hypothesis 4a
and 4b) but not the precise nature of the contingent relationships (2c and 4c).

DISCUSSION
The present study provides insight into the “in use” (versus espoused) decision making
of venture capitalists. Strategy literature from an industrial organization perspective
was used to identify and predict the decision criteria (and the interrelationships between
criteria) used by venture capitalists in assessing the profitability of a new venture. The
results demonstrate that while a number of criteria affect the decision strategies of venture capitalists (timing, key success factor stability, lead time, competitive rivalry, educational capability, and industry-related competence) for some, their affects must be qualified by the presence of contingent relationships, specifically, an interaction with timing
of entry. These contingent relationships are consistent with IO strategy and provide
empirical support for Hofer (1975) and DeCastro and Chrisman’s (1995) conceptual
arguments that researchers must investigate contingent relationships when studying
strategy. Discussion of specific findings and their implications for venture capitalists’
decision making are presented below.
Venture capitalists utilize a range of factors in making assessments of new venture
profitability. These include timing, key success factor stability, lead time, competitive
rivalry, educational capability, and industry-related competence and the interaction of
timing with key success factor stability, lead time, and educational capability in their
assessment of new venture profitability. The importance of these criteria (in descending

<-----Page 12----->NEW VENTURE STRATEGY

461

order) are industry-related competence, competitive rivalry, timing, educational capability, lead time, key success factor stability, timing ⫻ lead time interaction, and all other
interactions. These findings are now discussed in terms of previous research.
The contingent relationship found between timing and key success factor stability
supports IO strategy research which shows key success factor instability can accelerate
the decline of a pioneer’s advantage either as a result of ineffective investment of research funds (Aaker and Day, 1986), using inappropriate methods (Nelson and Winter
1982), and/or reluctance to withdraw from highly profitable but mature technologies
(Yip 1982). The findings also support Yip (1982) who proposes that in environments
with unstable key success factors late followers are better positioned for profitability,
relative to pioneers, as a result of learning from competitor’s mistakes (Aaker and Day
1986; Carpenter and Nakamoto 1989; Prahalad and Hamel 1990).
A contingent relationship between timing and educational capability also was found.
Venture capitalists’ assessments align with previous IO strategy studies that demonstrate the importance of educational capability whether it be, for example, to create a
customer frame of reference for an innovative product (Slater 1993) or to create and
develop increased customer familiarity with the venture’s offerings (Gross 1979; Schmalensee 1981). High educational capability is associated by venture capitalists with greater
new venture profitability and to be more important to a pioneer than a late follower.
However, the findings demonstrate that venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability
declines with late entry regardless of the level of educational capability.
There is evidence of a contingent relationship between timing and lead time. Therefore venture capitalists’ decisions appear consistent with previous IO studies of strategy
that demonstrate a long lead time for a pioneer is associated with higher profitability
(Abell and Hammond 1979; Porter 1980) whether it be as a result of establishment of
a stronger brand name (Schmalensee 1982), experience (Abell and Hammond 1979),
or time to erect barriers to entry (Porter 1980). However, venture capitalists more favorably assess the likely profitability of a pioneer and a late follower when the pioneer has
a long lead time. Therefore, the findings of this study are inconsistent with those of the
strategy literature which propose a pioneer’s long lead time adversely affects the profitability of late followers who may have to overcome higher barriers to entry (Porter 1980)
and compete against a more experienced and entrenched competitor (Abell and Hammond 1979). This finding may indicate more about venture capitalists’ assessment of
industry attractiveness than a venture’s attractiveness relative to other industry participants. Based on the assumption that an industry which provides a long lead time is more
attractive, a pioneer or a late follower from an industry that yields a long lead time is
assessed more favorably than a pioneer or late follower from an industry that yields
only a short lead time.
Competitive rivalry plays an important and specific role in new venture strategy
theory, with competitive rivalry usually reducing overall industry profitability (Porter
1980; Slater 1993). The results here support the assertion made by entrepreneurs in
Bruno and Tyebjee’s (1983) study that the nature of competition is in itself a reason
for the denial of venture capital.
The use of industry-related competence by venture capitalists in this study provides
support for Dunne, Roberts, Samuelson and Levy’s (1989) concern that entry sizes and
post entry experiences may differ across entrants; Mitchell’s (1991) research on “newcomers”; and Roure and Madique’s (1986) finding that successful founders have previous industry experience. Therefore, researchers failing to recognize that corporate ven-

<-----Page 13----->462

D.A. SHEPHERD, R. ETTENSON, AND A. CROUCH

tures may differ in terms of industry-related competence may generalize their
conclusions about new venture profitability in inappropriate ways.
The finding that industry-related competence is used by (and important to) venture
capitalists’ in their assessment of profitability also provides support for a number of
previous venture capitalists’ decision making studies, including Tyebjee and Bruno
(1981) and Dixon’s (1991) finding that the most important criteria in venture capitalists
assessment of profitability is management skill. Although it contrasts with Hall and Hofer’s (1993) and Sandberg and Hofer’s (1987) finding that venture capitalists place little
importance on the skill or experience of the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team.
Within the context of this research, these findings provide evidence that a model
of venture capitalists’ assessment of profitability involving timing, key success factor
stability, lead time, competitive rivalry, educational capability, industry-related competence, timing ⫻ key success factor stability interaction, timing ⫻ lead time interaction,
and timing ⫻ educational capability can significantly explain the profitability assessment
decisions of most venture capitalists. The results also indicate that individual (and aggregate) venture capitalist’s profitability assessment decisions can be modeled and have
considerable predictive ability.
Conjoint analysis was the research method used to investigate venture capitalists’
decisions in terms of main effects and contingent relationships. Conjoint analysis, as
with all techniques, has its own limitations. Throughout the design and administration
of this study, attempts were made to minimize these limitations. Nonetheless, several
drawbacks should be stated and addressed. First, reliance on hypothetical ventures and
environments may reduce the external validity of the study compared to if the study used
‘real’ ventures and ‘real’ environments. There is evidence however, that hypothetical
representations are useful for capturing real policies (for example, Brehmer 1988;
Phelps and Shanteau 1978; Riquelme and Rickards 1992).
A further limitation of the study may be that providing dichotomous attributes may
eliminate perceptual requirements from the task, thereby placing less emphasis on
judges’ ability to extract attribute information. There is also the possibility that respondent’s could place importance on attributes only because they are presented in the experiment; this limitation is more likely with novice decision makers and is less likely
with expert or experienced individuals such as the venture capitalists employed here.
Although these criticisms of conjoint analysis have merit and do represent limitations
of the technique, the inclusion of attributes that are both theoretically justified and have
face validity when pilot tested mitigate any negative impact they might have.
There may also be questions regarding the generalization of the results. The sample
included only Australian venture capitalists. A number of respondents proposed that
Australian venture capital firms are modeled on their U.S. counterparts with many venture capitalists educated by U.S. universities. Furthermore, since deregulation of the
Australian financial markets, a number of multinational venture capital firms have entered the Australian venture capital industry. This globalization might suggest that the
results of this study are generalizable to venture capitalists in other countries, such as
the U.S. and U.K.
However, discussions with participants also revealed that the Australian venture
capital industry is in its growth stage and less mature than the U.S. industry. Therefore,
the ability to generalize this study’s results to venture capitalists in the U.S. and the
U.K. may be questionable. If differences exist, cross-national research may make an
important contribution to our knowledge about venture capitalists’ decision making—
the majority of venture capital research has been conducted in the U.S. and to a lesser

<-----Page 14----->NEW VENTURE STRATEGY

463

extent the UK. A natural extension of this study is to replicate it in the U.S. In sum,
care must be taken in generalizing the results of this study beyond Australian venture capitalists.

CONCLUSION
Hofer (1975) and DeCastro and Chrisman (1995) contend that researchers must investigate contingent relationships when studying strategy. The present study represents a
significant step in that direction. IO strategy literature was used to provide a theoretical
basis from which to generate venture capitalists’ decision criteria and the interrelationships among those criteria. Consistent with IO strategy research, the findings here suggest there may be contingent relationships among criteria used by venture capitalists
when assessing the profitability of a new venture. Using the IO strategy literature to
develop a series of proposed contingent relationships between entry strategy variables,
the results show that the timing ⫻ key success factor stability interaction, timing ⫻ lead
time interaction, and timing ⫻ educational capability interaction are significant in venture capitalists’ decision making. However, the relative importance of the interrelationships was secondary to other attributes (i.e., main effects). These findings are not inconsistent with social judgment theory (Brehmer and Joyce, 1988) and the results of
decision making outside of the research literatures in strategy and venture capital (e.g.,
Louviere, 1988) who propose that, in general, main effects will often capture the lion’s
share of the variance of an individual’s decision making while two-way interactions
rarely explain more than 6 to 8% of the variance.
Could it be possible that some venture capitalists are unable to conceptualize these
more complex contingent relationships? Are venture capitalists’ decision policies optimal? If not, can venture capitalists’ decision making be improved? Zackarakis and
Meyer (in press) found venture capitalists have information processing limitations and
that actuarial models improve venture capitalists’ assessment decisions. The contingent
nature of strategy variables, proposed by the IO strategy literature and confirmed empirically in the domain of venture capitalists’ decision making by this research, may form
the basis of an actuarial model, i.e., an expert system. Further research needs to be performed in developing and empirically testing an actuarial model that incorporates the
strategy variables and the contingent relationships proposed in this study. Further theoretical and empirical research also needs to performed into possible cognitive biases,
errors and limitations of venture capitalists in order to ascertain possible sources for
improving the accuracy of their assessments.
This study increases understanding of how venture capitalists assess a new venture
in terms of its likely profitability by applying knowledge from the IO strategy literature.
Such an understanding could help potential entrepreneurs better target their business
plan and presentations in order to increase their chances of raising venture capital. A
greater understanding of experienced venture capitalists’ decision making could also
help train inexperienced venture capitalists and generally increase performance in proposal evaluation.
