What criteria do venture capitalists use to make venture investment decisions? The criteria venture capitalists use to make their venture investment decisions are of interestfor several reasons. First, venture ~a~italists
are conspicuously successful in their investment decisions. The success
rate of venture capital-backed ventures is s~gnj~cantZ~~higher than the
success rate of new ventures generally (Dorsey 1979; Davis and Stetson
1984). A bette,r understanding of the criteria used could lead to a better understanding of the reasons
for this success.
Second, a better understanding of the criteria for successful new ventures could lead to an
improvement in the success rate of new ventures. Although there is no clear agreement on the precise
rate, the failure rate among new ventures is generally viewed as signijicantly higher than the average
failure rate (Dun and Bradstreet 1984; Van de Ven 1980; Shaper0 1981.).
Finally, venture capitalists’ investment criteria are of enormousimport to entrepreneurs seeking
venture funding. Such entrepreneurs require a significant infusion of capital in order to grow their
businesses, and knowledge of the criteria sought by venture capitalists can aid entrepreneurs in gaining
the necessary ~nancing.
This study attempts to uncover the criteriaused by venture capitalists through sem~structured
~nte~~ews and verbal protocol analysis of venture capitalists’ evaluations of actual venture proposals.
Sixteen verbai protocols-in
which the participants “think aloud” as they review business proposalswere made of venture capitalists’ venture evaiuation de&ions.
The @dings of this study suggest that venture capitalists screen and assess business proposals
very rapidly: the subjects in this study reached a GUINO-GO decision in an average of less than six
minutes on initial screening and less than 21 minutes on proposal assessment. In venture capitalists’

of the industry in which the proposed business will operate.
in the second stage of proposal assessment, the source of the business proposal also played a major
role in the venture capitalists’ interest in the plan, with proposals previously reviewed by persons
known and trusted by the venture capitalist receiving a high level of interest.
In addition to the spectfic criteria identtfied and how they were used in reaching GOINO-GO
decisions, the findings of this study also were surprising for the lack of importance venture capitalists
attached to the entrepreneurlentrepreneurial
team and the strategy of the proposed venture during
these early stages of the venture evaluation process.

PRODUCTION
This article reports the findings of an exploratory research project on venture capitalist
decision-making.
The objectives of the entire project are (1) to refine the stages of venture
capitalists’ venture evaluation decision processes; and (2) to identify the criteria used in each
of these processes. This article discusses the findings to date on venture capitalists’ decision
criteria used in the initial stages of the decision process (i.e., proposal screening and proposal
evaluation).
Venture capitalists’ are conspicuously
successful at selecting new ventures (Dorsey
1979; Bruno and Tyebjee 1983; Davis and Stetson 1984) and researchers credit much of
this success to the criteria they use in assessing proposed new ventures. It is not surprising,
then, that most of the research on venture capitalist decision-making
has focused on identifying their venture evaluation criteria (Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno
1984; MacMillan et aI 1985, 1987). Criteria identi~ed in these studies are summarized in
Table 1.
One interesting aspect common to these studies is that several of the key characteristics
identified were consistent across various studies, and the criteria identified can be grouped
into six distinct categories. As shown in Table 1, the preponderance of criteria identified to
date are related to the characteristics of the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team and to the
requirements of the venture firm.
There are, however, two key weaknesses common to these studies. First, all are open
to errors and biases as a result of self-reporting of data. As MacMillan et al. (1985) note:
“It is possible that respondents could be influenced by their perception of what is a desirable
response or a response that is seen as appropriate to their position as representatives of the
venture capital community. There is also a danger that some respondents may not use the
criteria in the ways that they think they do” (p. 122).
Second, each of these studies has examined the key characteristics sought by venture
capitalists using ex post facto data-gathering techniques. As a consequence, the results could
be biased by inaccuracies in the recall ability of the venture capitalists, especially in trying
to differentiate between the criteria that led to success vis-a-vis those that led to failure. The
criteria depicted in Table 1 provide a critical insight to this research. Because most studies
did not specify the stage of the decision process that was studied, it is likely that the criteria
identified came from different stages of venture capitalists’ venture evaluation process. To
the extent that this is true, it means that the criteria identified in these studies cannot be
compared directly with one another, as the authors of some of these studies have tried to
do, until they can be placed in the context in which they occurred. While it appears that
these contexts may be similar, insufficient data were presented to be certain of this.
To date only three researchers have studied venture capitalists’ decision-m~ing
from
a process perspective (Table 2).

In the first of these studies, Wells (1974) identified six distinct stages in the venture
funding decision process through interviews with partners at seven venture capital firms.
These were (1) the search for investment opportunities, which involved contacting other
intermediarres (e.g., banks, other venture capital firms); (2) the screening of proposals, in
which several standardized questions were asked; and (3) the evaluation of proposals, in
which the proposed business deal was investigated “as completely as possible” (p. 187).
Once these evaluations were completed, the new businesses were either funded or rejected,
after which the venture capitalist spent significant amounts of time with the new firms (4)

in venture board meetings and follow-up; (5) in dealing with venture operations; and ultimately (6) in cashing out of the ventures.
Wells found that different criteria were applied at the screening and evaluation phases,
moving from broad questions at the screening stage to specific ones during evaluation.
In their 1984 study, Tyebjee and Bruno went beyond the identification of venture
evaluation criteria by developing a five-stage model of venture capital investment activity.
The five stages they identified were: (1) deal originating, or the search for prospective
investments; (2) screening, in which most proposals are rejected based on the venture capital
firm’s investment criteria; (3) evaluation, during which the proposed venture is examined
in detail; (4) deal structuring, during which the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur agree
to specific financial arrangements; and (5) postinvestment activities, which encompasses the
venture capitalist’s involvement in the management of the new venture. Basically, Tyebjee
and Bruno’s framework condensed the fourth and fifth stages of Well’s framework into a
single stage, added a new stage called deal structuring, and dropped the cashing out stage.
In 1985, A. David Silver, an experienced venture capitalist, described the venture
evaluation process in very similar terms. According to Silver, the process consisted of six
stages, the first of which was generating a deal flow, with the best deals coming from
previously backed entrepreneurs and other venture capitalists. Next came an initial screen
in which most proposals were rejected. This was followed by the due diligence process,
which Silver described as a series of five audits: the size of the problem the business is
attempting to solve, the elegance of the solution, the entrepreneurial
team, the financial
statement, and legal aspects. The fourth phase involved the structuring of the terms and
conditions for funding of the venture. Once the agreement to finance the venture had been
made, the venture capitalist then monitored the progress of the new investment and attempted
to add value to the business. In the final phase, the venture capital firm’s involvement in
the new business ended when it sold or liquified its investment.

Basically, Silver’s model followed Tyebjee and Bruno’s (1984) except in the term
used for the pre-cash stage.
As part of his 1989 study, Hall interviewed venture capitalists to identify the stages
in their decision-making
process. He identified eight stages: work aimed at generating a
deal frow was followed by brief proposal screening. Proposals that successfully passed this
stage were then assessed in more detail. The fourth step involved project evaluation, during
which the venture capitalist(s) actually toured the business and/or met with the entrepreneurial
team. Ventures in which the venture capitalist(s) was still interested were then subjected to
due diligence. Once the agreement to make a deal was made in principle, a deal structuring
meeting was conducted, and venture operations begun. The final stage occurred if and when
the venture capital firm cashed out of the venture.
As shown in Table 2, perhaps the most significant facts revealed by this review are
that all of the researchers who studied venture capitalists’ decision-making
agreed (1) that
it consisted of multiple stages; and (2) that the venture evaluation itself involved at least
two distinct stages: (a) screening, and (b) evaluation. The latter point is especially important
because, as noted above, of all the researchers who studied the criteria used by venture
capitalists to (evaluate new venture proposals, only Wells (1974) differentiated between these
different stages in his research. This means not only that it is highly probable that different
criteria are used in different stages but also that any new research of venture capitalist
decision-mak.ing must use methodologies that can and will capture any possible differences
among stager.. It also means that the findings reported to date have probably “mixed” different
stage criteria and possibly even generated some spurious results.
Because the criteria used by venture capitalists at each stage of the decision process
has been the focus of few studies, this exploratory study sought to identify the specific
criteria examined by venture capitalists during the early stages of their evaluation (i.e., the
initial screening and assessment of venture funding proposal requests).

METHODS
First, semistructured interviews on the decision process and criteria were conducted at four
venture capital firms. These venture capitalists then provided the protocols for this study.
While confidentiality was guaranteed in order to gain the cooperation of the venture capitalists, general information about the firms is provided in Table 3. The protocols were taped
on an audio tape recorder and verbatim transcriptions were made of the tapes. A total of 16
protocols were collected. Ten of the protocols involved proposal screenings; the remaining
six were proposal assessments. As shown in Table 4, the 16 protocols covered a wide range
of businesses, including both high-technology
and service ventures, and including requests
for start-up, second stage, and leverage buy-out funding.
The number of protocols was limited both by accessibility and the large volume of
data provided by the protocols. A major limitation of verbal protocol analysis is that the
volume of data collected necessitates a small sample size. Isenberg (1986) notes that the
sample sizes in studies using this methodology have typically ranged from three to 15. Thus,
this project, using 16 verbal protocols, is not only within an acceptable range in terms of
number of protocols, but is at the upper limit of that range.

Methodology
The primary methodology used to identify these criteria was verbal protocol analysis as the
venture capitalists reviewed actual business proposals they had received. Verbal protocols

involve the participant “thinking aloud” as he or she performs a particular task (Ericsson
and Simon 1984). Verbal protocols have been used extensively in studying a variety of
situations involving problem-solving
and decision-making,
such as job choice (Soelberg
1965), strategic decision-making
(Schweiger 1980), consumer choice (Bettman 1974), and
the design of management information systems (Vitalari 1980).
In any methodology involving self-reporting, the validity of the responses is a concern.
Ericsson and Simon (1984) outline eight conditions under which verbal reports will be most
accurate: (1) the information reported is the focus of attention; (2) the task is not highly
routinized; (3) a short time elapses between task and recording; (4) verbalization does not
require excessive encoding; (5) the reports are oral; (6) subjects are free of distractions; (7)
the questions and instructions on how to verbalize are clear and specific; and (8) the reports
are as complete as possible. All eight conditions were met in this research.

Procedures
The subjects were told that they were going to analyze some of the business plans they had
recently received but not yet read. They were asked to read the business plan the way they

would normally read it, but to verbalize their thoughts as they reviewed the plan. They were
free to make notes or use a calculator if they so wished. They were instructed to verbalize
their thoughts constantly, even though they were reading the proposals. In order to provide
participants with clear, specific instructions on protocols, Ericsson and Simon (1984) recommend walking through a practice protocol and then discussing with the participant what
they were thinking about as they answered the practice question. In this study, the researcher
demonstrated the think-aloud procedure by asking the venture capitalists, “How many windows do you have in your house?’ and “What did you think about as you tried to answer
that question?’

Data Analysis
The verbatim transcriptions of the protocols were coded into thought segments, which were
then analyzed in detail. Thought segments are clauses, sentences, and phrases that are
independent units (Ericsson and Simon 1984). Thought segments in the verbal protocols are
identified most frequently through pauses in speech. For coding purposes, each thought
segment should be understandable
when taken out of context. Thought segments were
numbered sequentially in each protocol. A typical thought segment coding (from Protocol
7) is shown below:

summary.1

Using the definition of thought segments as a guide, an independent judge (a Ph.D.
student who had field experience with qualitative methods) coded a random sample of 25%
of the verbal protocols. The percentage of agreement (POA) between the researcher and the
judge was .907. Gellert (1955) notes that POA reliability below .70 is considered poor and
above .85 is “very satisfactory.”
The thought segments in each protocol were then classified by the criteria in the business
proposal the venture capitalist was examining. The initial coding scheme utilized criteria
developed from literature on venture capitalists’ venture evaluation criteria as described in
Table 1. After coding two protocols using these criteria, it was decided to revise the coding

<-----Page 8----->NEW VENTURE

EVALUATION

scheme using two additional categories: (7) financial information on the proposed business,
and (8) actions and pauses. While statements on financial information could have legitimately
been coded under nature of the proposed business, a large number of comments were made
in the protocols that related strictly to financial information. It was decided therefore, that
the addition of a category to capture just the financial information might shed some additional
insight on the venture evaluation process, particularly as venture capitalists seemed to focus
on this information as a separate aspect of the business. The actions category was added to
permit coding of the natural pauses that occur in speech, as well as to indicate physical
actions.
After coding all 1,939 thought segments into one (and only one) of these eight categories, each thought segment was then further classified according to the nature of the
statement involved in order to examine the thought segments in finer detail.
Many of the thought segments were direct quotes from the business plans. However,
based on reviews of the protocols, the researchers believed that some of the more interesting
thought segments were questions, opinions, and decision statements made by the venture
capitalists. Based on the data, five types of statements were proposed for such classification:
(1) actions (A) and verbal pauses (VP); (2) descriptive statements (DS); (3) questions (Q);
(4) opinions (0); and (5) decisions (D). This coding scheme proved to be both exclusive
and exhaustive for all protocols.
Using these criteria, a random sample of 20.6% of all thought segments were coded
by both the researcher and two independent judges. Both of the judges were doctoral students
in strategic management who had completed course work and field work in qualitative
methods. The levels of agreement were measured using both POA and Cohen’s (1960) K
(k). The median interrater scores were (1) criteria categories k, .778, POA, .820, (2)
statement categories k, .842, POA, .885. After subsequent discussion among the raters, the
major disagreements were resolved by sharpening the coding definitions. The median revised
POAs were (1) .970 for the criteria categories, and (2) .980 for the statement categories.
The coded protocols were presented in transition matrices, in which the thought segments in each protocol are numbered sequentially and the criteria and statement category
codings are displayed such that the patterns of thought are shown. A typical transition matrix

RESULTS
Tables 5 and 6 provide summary analyses of the proposal screening and proposal assessment
protocols.
A number of criteria are examined in the proposal screening process, but not all criteria
are directly related to the investment decision. As shown in Tables 5 and 6, all seven of
the criteria were touched on in the protocols. However, not all criteria were assessed in each
proposal. Rather, the process proceeded until the venture capitalists identified a reason to
reject the proposal or completed that stage of review without discovering a “fatal flaw.”
While the criteria examined in each protocol are interesting, the specific criteria cited
in the protocols as the reasons for the venture capitaIists’ decisions were examined most
closely. The reasons for the decisions were deduced by examining the pattern of comments
surrounding the decision in each protocol and through debriefing interviews with the venture
capitalists.

REASONS FOR PROPOSAL SCREENING DECISIONS
Of the 10 proposal screening protocols, eight were rejected, one was a likely rejection, and
one was moved to the next stage in the decision process. Table 7 outlines the major criteria
noted in the proposal screening protocols.
Protocols I and 5 were rejected due to the lending policies at the venture capital firm.
Venture Capitalist B had defined the preferred financing as second stage, and the proposed
company in Protocol I was seeking start-up money. In Protocol 5, Venture Capitalist C
clearly stated that he did not invest in defense companies. Rejection due to the lending
guidelines of the venture firm is not surprising, as all 10 proposal screening protocols were
sent to the venture capital firms without referral. One can assume that these 10 proposals
were mailed to a number of venture capital firms, and detailed information on the kinds of
investments a venture firm makes is difficult (and sometimes impossible) to get without
some personal interaction with or introduction to the firm.
The stated reason the venture capitalists rejected Protocols 4 and 9 was the lack of
financiai info~ation
in the proposals. Based on the lack of a full proposal i and the inclusion
of two “extremely thick” cu~cuIum
vitae) in Protocol 4, Venture Capitalist C inferred that
the entrepreneurs were “mad scientists.” At the end of his brief (2 minutes 45 seconds)
review, Venture Capitalist C commented that he could not understand the nature of the
product from the executive summary. Also, there is some question as to whether or not,
Venture Capitalist D ever seriously considered following up on Protocol 9; essentially, he
found the product/service interesting from a personal but not a business perspective. Given
the comments on financial information in the 10 protocols, it is likely that a financial section
with realistic projections is necessary in a business proposal-even
though the venture
capitalists do not put much faith in the numbers. Rather, the absence of financial information
raises questions about the seriousness of the request for funds and the business capabilities
of the entrepreneur.
Protocol 6 was rejected due to the manner in which the firm proposed to develop and
distribute its product. What is interesting about this protocol is that Venture Capitalist C
appeared to have some interest in the product and could have requested more information

or inquired whether the entrepreneurs would be interested in changing their distribution
plans. There are two plausible explanations why Venture Capitalist C did not request more
information: ~(1)there was some other factor in the proposal that caused rejection; or (2)
there was not sufficient interest in the proposal to overcome objections to the existing plans.
Throughout the protocol, Venture Capitalist C indicated a favorable attitude toward the
product and the market. Therefore, explanation 2 appears to be the more reasonable one.
The proposals presented in Protocols 2, 3, and 7 were rejected, and Protocol 8 conditionally rejected, due to a combination of the nature of the pr~ucts/se~ices
and the
industries in which the businesses proposed to enter. In all four cases, the venture capitalists
were familiar with the nature of the businesses and industries because they had previously
reviewed proposals for such businesses. While the specific reasons for rejection varied, the
key to the venture capitalists’ thinking appears to follow intuitive logic: I have rejected other
proposals in this business/industry; there is nothing in this proposal to indicate it is different
from or better than previously reviewed proposals in this business/industry; therefore, this
proposal should be rejected. The effect of this is to screen quickly (and reject) a large number
of proposals.
Protocol 10 was the only one of the 10 screening protocois to move to the next stage
of the venture capitalist’s decision process. It also was the longest of the 10 protocols in
terms of review time (16 minutes 19 seconds versus a mean of 5 minutes 40.7 seconds),
and these two factors are probably related: venture capitalists spend relatively more time on
a proposal that interests them as an investment. There were four factors that favorably

impressed Venture Capitalist D about the proposal. These were (in the order in which they
were mentioned in the protocol) (1) the company was located in Venture Firm D’s geographic
area of interest; (2) the industry was viewed as “a real market”; (3) Venture Firm D had
seriously investigated a business in this industry in the past; and (4) the company involved
had been a profitable small business for 19 years. Factor 3-prior investigation by the venture
capital firm-appeared
to be the most important of these factors. This decision process is
the flip side of the decisions to not pursue Protocols 2, 3, 7, and 8; while those protocols
were rejected because similar proposals had been rejected, Protocol 10 was accepted at this
stage because a similar proposal had been accepted in the past. The effect is the same in
all five cases: it reduces the amount of time spent screening a large number of proposals.

REASONS FOR PROPOSAL ASSESSMENT DECISIONS
Of the six proposal assessment protocols, two were rejected, decisions on two were deferred,
and two were moved to the next stage in the decision process (see Table 7).
Protocols 11 and 12 were rejected. Throughout Protocol 11, Venture Capitalist C
commented on the nature of the product and business, specifically that it was a consumer
product with what he believed was a very narrow segment of the market, One question
raised on this proposal is why the venture capitalist invested the time to review it in depth
(i.e., why wasn’t it screened out?). A clue to the answer to this question came early in the

protocol, in which Venture Capitalist C noted that he had screened the proposal when it
came in because the proposal came with a sample of the product attached.
Venture Capitalist D rejected Protocol 12 because, although the proposal claimed the
business was in the health care industry, Venture Capitalist D perceived it to be in the real
estate business, and Venture Firm D did not invest in real estate projects. This proposal was
assessed (rather than screened out) because it came recommended by an investment banker
Venture Capitalist D had dealt with on the phone. Because the proposal was for a real estate
project, Venture Capitalist D revised his opinion (downward) of the investment banker,
Decisions on Protocols 14 and 15 were deferred indefinitely. Protocol 14 appealed to
Venture Capitalist D in terms of the industry (a winery), the management team (three of
the four top managers had extensive experience in wineries), the state of funding (leveraged
buyout), and the concept the business had developed of using the plant and equipment to
produce both wine and other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. However, the proposal
itself was written in what Venture Capitalist D viewed as a disjointed manner; he inferred
from this that the principals did not yet have a deal on the leveraged buy-out of the winery.
Venture Capitalist D decided to set the proposal aside to see if the management team followed
up.
In Protocol 15, the reason for Venture Capitalist D’s decision to wait for the company
to grow more before investigating it further was clearly linked to what he viewed as a lack
of clearly defined strategy. In this case, Venture Capitalist D had screened an earlier version
of the proposal and visited with people at the company. Indeed, this may be the reason that
Protocol 15 was the only one of the six proposal assessments in which strategy played a
major role in the decision: it was the only one in which the venture capitalist had invested
significant amounts of time in investigating. Because he was further along in his investigation
than the venture capitalists were on the remaining protocols, a defensible strategy may have
been the last major prerequisite prior to moving forward in the decision process.
Protocols 13 and 16 were moved to the next stage in the decision process. Venture
Capitalist D was predisposed toward Protocol 13 because it had been screened and recommended to him by one of his partners. However, the major turning point in the decision
to proceed came when Venture Capitalist D recognized the company’s president as someone
who had successfully started a company in a similar business and who had worked with
venture capitalists before. This was a sufficiently strong criterion to overcome some objections about the nature of the business and industry.
Protocol 16 also had been referred to the venture capitalist by one of his partners.
Early in the protocol, the venture capitalist indicated an interest in the nature of the product/business and the industry. Ultimately, the proposed business’s claims for their product
were sufficiently strong for him to move forward on further evaluation.

STRATEGY, FINANCE, AND THE ENTREPRENEUR
The criteria nor used in the proposal screening and assessment decisions were somewhat
surprising in that they appear to contradict previous studies that found that the strategy of
the proposed venture, financial factors such as risk and return on investment, and characteristics of the entrepreneur are major decision criteria in venture capitalists’ decision-making
(Wells 1974; Poindexter 1976; Tyebjee and Bruno 1984; MacMillan et al 1985, 1987).
The strategy of the proposed business was relatively unimportant
in the proposal
screening and proposal assessment protocols. Thought segments relating to the strategy of
the proposed business accounted for only 1.3% of all thought segments in the proposal

<-----Page 14----->NEWVENTUREEVALUATION

39

screening protocols and 3.5% of all thought segments in the proposal assessment protocols,
and no proposals in these stages were rejected as the result of this criterion. One plausible
explanation for this is that the strategy a proposed business intends to use is difficult to
assess effectively based on the limited information contained in most written proposals. It
is, therefore, usually examined in depth during the stage of the venture evaluation process
in which the venture capitalist has the time needed to perform this examination.
While financial information on the proposed businesses was reviewed and commented
on in a majority of proposals, it did not appear to be a major criterion in the venture
capitalists’ decisions. There are two plausible interpretations that may explain this apparent
contradiction. First, the importance of risk and return to the venture capitalist may have
been articulated through other criteria, such as the venture capital firm’s venture preference
criteria, the nature of the proposed business, the economic environment of the proposed
business, or the strategy of the proposed venture. For example, when a proposed business
was rejected because the venture firm did not wish to invest in the industry in which the
proposed business planned to enter, it may have been that the reason for this criterion was
the fact that the venture firm had found this particular industry to be relatively risky or to
have a generally lower rate of return than other industries and, as a consequence, chose not
to pursue any investments in such industries.
A second possible explanation is that venture capitalists make their final in-depth
assessments of financial worthiness in the project evaluation stage and/or in the structuring
of the deal stage of their decision-making
process. If so, they could have easily been missed
in this study due to the stages of the venture capitalists’ decisions examined.
It is likely that both of these explanations apply. Thus, general risk/reward potentials
are clearly calptured through several of the other criteria examined by venture capitalists,
and, quite probably, specific risk/reward trade-offs of the venture investment are then determined by and considered in the process of structuring the deal.
Finally.. criteria relating to the characteristics of the entrepreneur or founding management team did not play a major role in the proposal screening and proposal assessment
stages of the venture evaluation process. While observations on the entrepreneur were made
in most of the proposals (e.g., age, experience), they did not usually play a major role in
the decision to reject or accept the proposals studied. There were two exceptions to this
general lack of attention to the entrepreneur in proposal screening and proposal assessment.
In Protocol 4, Venture Capitalist C made some negative assumptions about the entrepreneurs
involved based on the way in which the business proposal was packaged (i.e., he assumed
that a competent entrepreneur would not have packaged the proposal so poorly). In protocol
13, Venture Capitalist D became more interested in the proposed business when he recognized
the company’s president as someone who had previously founded a successful company in
the same industry.
The ba.sic conclusion based on both the more general observations and the two exceptions is that the characteristics of the entrepreneur are not important in proposal screening
and proposal assessment, except at the extreme ends of the distribution of entrepreneurial
talent (i.e., the very incompetent and the potentially very competent).

WHAT VENTURE
SHOULD
KNOW

CAPITALISTS

AND ENTREPRENEURS

The findings of this study suggest several areas in which venture capitalists and prospective
entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding can be better served in their decisions.
Venture capitalists’ venture investment decisions can be viewed from an information-

<-----Page 15----->40

J. HALL AND C.W. HOFER

processing perspective. A fuller understanding of this process by venture capitalists could
lead to greater efficiency in the ways in which they evaluate prospective businesses. This
study investigated decision-making
at four venture capital firms, and it is Iikely that a number
of individual variations exist and quite possible that certain decision-making
models are
more effective than others.
There are a number of implications
for prospective entrepreneurs
seeking venture
capital funding. First, they should know the investment preferences of the venture firms
they are targeting. Venture firms have different preferences as to the kinds of investments
they make and sending a business plan to a venture capital firm that does not invest in the
industry in which the proposed business intends to enter is a waste of time and effort. A
second point related to successful funding is the impo~ance of contacts in reaching the
appropriate venture capital fin. Blindly sending business plans with a generic cover letter
was not a successful approach in the proposals studied. The ideal situation is when the
entrepreneur knows the venture capitalist. However, other contacts whose track record the
venture capitalist appreciates-such
as lawyers, bankers, accountants, consultants, and business school faculty--can
be utilized.
Based on the observations made by the venture capitalists in the protocols, an idea
for a product or service-no
matter how brilliant-must
be presented in a professional
package. The plan also should be simple, including all relevant information while keeping
extraneous information to a minimum. Despite the number of books and articles written as
aids in preparing a business proposal, a well-written plan was no guarantor of success.
However, a professionally
presented proposal appeared to be a necessary but insufficient
criterion for acceptance. The thrust of the protocol comments was that venture proposals
should be short documents that provide the major pieces of info~ation
the venture capitalist
needs to make a decision. This information includes an overview of the proposed business,
the amount of funding requested, the use of these funds, a brief listing of the management
of the proposed business, and a summary of both current financial information and financial
projections.
Finally, as venture capital firms typically make large investments in the businesses
they fund, and as they will typically be called on to make additional investments if things
develop as anticipated, the entrepreneur/founding
management team must be willing to work
closely with the venture capitalists after the initial investment has been made. As a consequence, one of the factors carefully considered in the final stages of project evaluation is
the entrepreneur’s
willingness and ability to do this and whether or not the “chemistry”
between the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist is right.

CONCLUSIONS
There remains much to be learned about venture capitalists’ decision-making.
This study
has contributed to this area in several respects. First, we suspected that previous research
on the criteria used by venture capitalists was not reconciled with the research on the process
of venture capitalist decision-making,
and therefore that the findings reported to date have
probably “mixed” different stage criteria. By designing this study with in-depth field work
and qualitative methods, we found that previous research that focused only on criteria without
regard for the stage of the decision process very likely generated spurious results. Second,
by focusing on the criteria venture capitalists’ examine in the early stages of the venture
evaluation process, this study helps move the literature from a single-stage, single-set of
criteria to the more complex, and realistic, perspective of a multistage, multicriteria,
and

<-----Page 16----->41

multiperson decision. Finally, this study demonstrates that when real-time decisions are
made, verbal protocol analysis-which
can capture the full range of data nuances and
conditionality-is
a powerful data-collection method that deserves far greater use than it has
received in the past.
For prospective entrepreneurs,
this study provides information on the criteria sought
by venture capitalists that can aid the entrepreneur in seeking venture capital funding. Finally,
for venture capitalists, this study has provided a starting point for discussing the efficiency
and effectiveness of the venture investment decision-making
process.
