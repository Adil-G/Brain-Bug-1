Prior Knowledge,
Potential Financial
Reward, and
Opportunity
Identification
Dean A. Shepherd

This article simultaneously explores the constructs of potential financial reward and prior
knowledge of customer problems to provide a deeper understanding of the identification of
opportunities. Results suggest that while prior knowledge of customer problems leads to
the identification of more opportunities and opportunities that are more innovative, it also
moderates the relationship between potential financial reward and opportunity identification. We found that the less knowledgeable an individual was about customer problems, the
more positive the effect that potential financial reward had on the number of opportunities
identified and the innovativeness of those opportunities.

Introduction
In a rapidly changing world, organizations need to continually identify new opportunities beyond existing competencies if they are to survive and prosper (Hamel &
Prahalad, 1989; McGrath, Tsai, Venkataraman, & MacMillan, 1996). The identification
of opportunities has been recognized as one of the most important abilities of successful
entrepreneurs (Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003) and consequently has become an
important element of the scholarly study of entrepreneurship. Gaglio and Katz (2001,
p. 95) contend that “understanding the opportunity identification process represents one
of the core intellectual questions for the domain of entrepreneurship.” Recent research
into resource-based theory has extended its boundaries to include identification of opportunities as a resource that, through the process of exploitation, can lead to competitive
advantage (Alvarez & Busenitz, 2001). Not surprisingly there has been considerable
interest in why, when, and how some people are able to identify opportunities, while
others cannot or do not (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
Researchers have suggested that opportunity identification may be related to, among
other factors, entrepreneurial alertness (Kirzner, 1973), prior knowledge (Shane, 2000),

(Baron, 1998), and potential financial reward (Schumpeter, 1976). For a more complete
review see Appendix 1. Although each of these areas of study has made a contribution
to our understanding of opportunity identification, prior knowledge and potential financial reward have been central to many recent investigations. For example, social networks
are particularly important for accessing and reducing the costs of resources necessary for
entrepreneurial activity (Cromie, Birley, & Callaghan, 1994; Portes, 1998; Lin, Ensel, &
Vaughn, 1981); they are a source of information about new opportunities (enhance knowledge) and make entrepreneurial action more financially rewarding (Birley, 1985; Burt,
1997; Johannisson, 2000).
Prior knowledge refers to an individual’s distinctive information about a particular
subject matter and provides him or her with the capacity to identify certain opportunities
(Venkataraman, 1997; Shane, 2000). Potential financial reward is the possibility of financial gain that motivates individuals to identify opportunities (Venkataraman, 1997).
Despite the fact that investigating potential financial reward and prior knowledge
have added significant insights into the identification of opportunities, relatively little
research has empirically explored the inter-relationship between these constructs in the
identification of opportunities. McMullen and Shepherd (forthcoming) propose that
opportunity identification requires the concomitant consideration of an individual’s
knowledge and his or her motivation (including potential financial reward). In this study
we explore the inter-relationship between prior knowledge and financial reward to gain
a deeper understanding of opportunity identification.
Another issue central to the study of opportunity identification is how opportunities
are measured and therefore empirically tested. Past empirical research in opportunity
recognition has focused on identifying the variety and quantity of opportunities recognized (Hills & Shrader, 1998). Hills and Shrader (1998) operationalized opportunity
recognition as the number of new, major business opportunities or major new parts of an
existing business pursued in the previous five years. Singh, Hills, Hybels, and Lumpkin
(1999) operationalized opportunity identification as both the number of new venture ideas
identified and the number of new venture opportunities recognized.
While the number of opportunities identified is a highly appropriate outcome of the
opportunity identification process, it may not be a sufficient indicator of the value of an
opportunity. Given the central importance of frame-breaking opportunities to the theory
of discovery it is appropriate for investigators to distinguish between incremental and truly
innovative opportunities (Gaglio & Katz, 2001). Therefore, a measurement of “innovativeness” must be included when making a judgment about the value of an opportunity
(Fiet, 2002; Shane, 2000). Extensive research into creativity evaluation has determined
that both the number and the importance of creative discoveries are necessary to make a
critical evaluation (e.g. Amabile, 1990; Hughes, 1963). Fiet (2002, p. 183) uses an innovation scale ranging from “no apparent innovation” to “new-to-the-world product or
service, a pure invention” to measure the innovativeness of opportunities identified.
Consequently, in this article we explore the relationship between level of prior knowledge and potential financial reward in the identification of opportunities in terms of both
the number of opportunities identified and the innovativeness of those opportunities. To
explore this relationship, we conducted an experimental study examining whether prior
knowledge is directly related to identification, whether potential financial reward is
directly related to identification, and whether prior knowledge moderates the relationship
between potential financial reward and the identification of opportunities.
The article proceeds as follows. First, we use research based upon Austrian economics and cognitive psychology to highlight how an individual’s level of prior knowl92

motivation literature, we discuss how financial reward impacts the identification of opportunities. Third, we discuss the interrelationships among the variables and hypothesize that
the relationship between potential financial reward and the identification of opportunities
is moderated by prior knowledge. Fourth, we describe the research method and the results.
Finally, we discuss the findings.

Conceptual Model and Hypotheses
Prior Knowledge and Opportunity Identification
Scholars of Austrian economics argue that people have different prior knowledge
and this allows some individuals to identify certain opportunities (Hayek, 1945;
Venkataraman, 1997).1 Prior knowledge, which refers to an individual’s distinctive information about a particular subject matter, may be the result of work experience (Evans &
Leighton, 1989; Cooper, Gimeno, & Woo, 1994), education (Gimeno, Folta, Cooper, &
Woo, 1997) or other means (Shane, 2000). It may be accumulated through experiential
learning—intentional or unintentional knowledge that comes from direct experience and
vicarious learning—and/or through second-hand experience (Huber, 1991). For example,
Ed Pauls, the creator of NordicTrack, epitomizes how prior knowledge allows individuals to identify opportunities. Ed was a trained mechanical engineer whose passion
revolved around cross-country skiing. His passion was unfulfilled when inclement
weather prevented him from going skiing. Thus, he invented an indoor cross-country ski
machine.
Past research in cognition suggests that increased knowledge in a particular field
allows individuals to acquire important advantages. For instance, as individuals become
more knowledgeable at a particular task through experience, they become increasingly
efficient; they learn to focus attention primarily on the key dimensions, the ones that
contribute most variance to the outcome of decisions (Chase & Simon, 1973; Choo &
Trotman, 1991; Weber, 1980). Individuals with more knowledge also appear to think in
a more intuitive way. That is, they make their decisions in a more automatic manner rather
than through more conscious, step-by-step systematic processing (Logan, 1990). This
automatic processing (and thus the decision making) is often faster.
Empirically, Busenitz and Barney (1997) found that entrepreneurs relied more
heavily on heuristics to speed up the decision making process than did managers. Without
such mechanisms, windows of opportunity would often close before an opportunity could
be identified. Prior general knowledge gained from education (referred to as general
human capital) facilitates the integration and accumulation of new knowledge, providing
individuals with a larger opportunity set (Gimeno, Folta, Cooper, & Woo, 1997). For
example, Davidsson and Honig (2003) found that years of education had a positive influence on the chance that a person would identify new opportunities. Based on the above
literature about prior knowledge and applying it to an opportunity identification task, we

Austrian entrepreneurship stems from the discovery of the existence of profitable discrepancies, gaps, and mismatches in knowledge and information that others have not yet perceived and exploited,
and the entrepreneur acts to capitalize upon the opportunity for gain or advantage which that discovery presents. These activities increase knowledge about the situation, reduce the general level of uncertainty over
time, and promote market processes that help to reduce or eliminate the gap between leaders and followers”
(Cheah, 1990: 343).

<-----Page 3----->expect that individuals with prior knowledge are likely to focus on the most important
dimensions of the information available and process this information in a more efficient
manner, leading to the identification of a greater number of opportunities.
Over and above a focus on the key dimensions of information and improved efficiency of information processing, knowledgeable individuals have created categories
of information based on a deep structure that involves more, stronger, and richer
links between concepts (Gobbo & Chi, 1986; Chi & Koeske, 1983; Frederick, 1991;
Frederick & Libby, 1986). These deeper and richer connections can enhance an individual’s ability to identify opportunities that are more innovative. Fiet (2002) contends that
the most important determinant of the innovativeness of an idea is specificity of prior
knowledge. The concept of prior knowledge has also been shown to be a major component of creativity. Amabile (1997, p. 42) states “It [relevant knowledge or expertise] can
be viewed as the set of cognitive pathways that may be followed for solving a given
problem or doing a given task—the problem solver’s network of possible wanderings.”
Cohen and Levinthal (1990, p. 130), in their work on absorptive capacity, point out why
relevant knowledge may lead to more innovative ideas stating “the prior possession of
relevant knowledge and skill is what gives rise to creativity, permitting the sorts of associations and linkages that may have never been considered before.” Therefore, it appears
that prior knowledge can enhance an individual’s ability to both generate a greater number
of opportunities and the level of innovativeness of those opportunities. Thus,
H1: Higher levels of prior knowledge are associated with the identification of (a) a
greater number of opportunities and (b) opportunities that are more innovative.

Motivation and Opportunity Identification
Creativity scholars (e.g., Amabile, 1993) as well as some entrepreneurship scholars
(e.g., Birley & Westhead, 1994; Douglas & Shepherd, 2003) have determined there are
non-financial/intrinsic motivators for involvement in entrepreneurship. Despite this
research, much of the literature in economics and entrepreneurship relies on financial
reward as the primary motivator for involvement in entrepreneurship (Baumol, 1990;
Kuratko, Hornsby & Naffziger, 1997; Langan-Fox & Roth, 1995). For example, in their
study of entrepreneurs in the Midwest, Kuratko, Hornsby, and Naffziger (1997, p. 31)
found “extrinsic goals concentrating on wealth” were important for sustaining entrepreneurship. Baumol (1990, p. 894) also proposed that “how the entrepreneur acts at a given
time and place depends heavily on . . . the reward structure in the economy . . . (or) the
prevailing rules of the game that govern the payoff.” Similarly, Campbell (1992) proposed an economic theory of entrepreneurship where an individual chooses to be an entrepreneur if the expected present value of profit from entrepreneurship exceeds that of being
an employee. Finally, Schumpeter (1961) suggests that empire building to gain financial
reward is an important motivation for entrepreneurs.
To gain a better understanding of how financial reward might motivate entrepreneurs,
we turn to motivation theorists Campbell and Pritchard (1976), who propose that motivation is the decision whether to initiate effort on a certain task, how much effort to
expend, and how long to persist. The decision to initiate effort and the choice about how
much effort to expend is greatest when high levels of effort are associated with high levels
of performance, which in turn lead to valued outcomes such as pay (Kanfer, 1990; Vroom,
1964). Therefore, motivation can be initiated or strengthened through the promise of
potential financial reward. Researchers have shown that there is a positive relationship

94

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->between the promise of financial reward and the number of outcomes and between financial reward and the innovativeness of outcomes. For example, Abbey and Dickson (1983)
found that the level of rewards and achievement motivation were positively related to the
number of innovations initiated. Using ratings by employees of the overall innovativeness of their own R&D laboratory’s outputs, Paolillo and Brown (1978) also found a positive correlation between the level of innovation and rewards.
In addition, research into the relationship between the promise of financial reward
and creativity suggests a positive relationship (e.g., Woodman, Sawyer, & Griffin, 1993).2
Most creativity researchers contend that creativity and innovation are strongly linked
(Cummings & O’Connell, 1978). Therefore, it appears that the promise of financial
reward can enhance an individual’s ability to both generate a greater number of opportunities and the level of innovativeness of those opportunities. Thus,
H2: Higher levels of potential financial reward are associated with (a) a greater
number of opportunities identified and (b) opportunities that are more
innovative.
However, even if an individual is motivated to identify opportunities, the act of identifying opportunities is unlikely unless he or she has the prior knowledge to do so.
Amabile (1997, p. 42) contends that “expertise (factual knowledge and technical proficiency) is the foundation for all creative work,” and Fiet (2002, p. 118) found that individuals who identified opportunities through the use of consideration sets—“a promising
group of information channels, which entrepreneurs can select and search based on their
prior knowledge”—identified ideas that were more likely to lead to new wealth creation.
Therefore, we suggest that the relationship between financial reward, prior knowledge,
and opportunity identification may be more complex than a straightforward, additive
relationship.

Potential Financial Reward, Prior Knowledge, and
Opportunity Identification
Potential financial reward and prior knowledge have primarily been investigated separately, yet it is their concomitant consideration that likely provides additional insight
into opportunity identification. Although there is a gap in the literature addressing the
relationships among financial reward, prior knowledge, and opportunity identification,
some research suggests how prior knowledge affects the relationship between potential
financial reward and the performance of a task. For example, Csikszentmihayli (1975,
2000) in his work with highly skilled persons found that those individuals with greater
prior knowledge were characterized by undivided attention to the task, providing at least
temporary protection against competing demands for attention. These individuals felt they
were in control of the activity, and their attention was highly focused on the task. Additionally, Maheswaran and Sternthal (1990) found that experts (those with more knowledge) are more likely to process a message in detail when given only content information,
while novices are more likely to do so when given reward information. This suggests that
individuals with higher prior knowledge may become engaged in a project at a level
wherein their motivation to excel is no longer driven by financial reward. Therefore, prior

creativity (Woodman et al., 1993).

<-----Page 5----->knowledge may provide some motivation toward a given task whether or not financial
reward is involved.
Consider the inventor of Velcro, a Swiss engineer by the name of George de Mestral,
who, upon placing a cocklebur under a microscope, began an eight-year obsession to
emulate the burr-clasping system. Despite warnings from friends and associates that
he was headed for personal despair and financial ruin, he retreated to a small mountain
hut wherein after a long period of time he emerged with the basic technology for Velcro.
This example typifies an individual not driven by financial reward, but rather by a
motivation to solve a problem based upon prior knowledge. Fortunately for de Mestral,
financial reward was forthcoming! In another example, pre-venture clients of a small
business development center (SBDC) reported that they wanted to start a business
because they had a desire to use knowledge and experience in addition to show that it
could be done (Gatewood, Shaver, & Gartner, 1995). In this case, prior knowledge
provided the motivation toward venture creation without the consideration of financial
reward.
Applied to the task of opportunity identification, we propose that a deeper understanding of the motivating influence of potential financial reward on opportunity identification requires the concomitant consideration of prior knowledge. That is, using the
motivation literature, we have proposed that the promise of potential financial reward
motivates individuals to identify more opportunities and opportunities that are more innovative. However, based on the literature in this section, it appears that knowledge is also
a motivator and as such can diminish the positive relationship between financial reward
and both opportunity identification outcomes. Therefore, prior knowledge provides an
individual an increased ability to “see” more quickly important connections between concepts (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Logan, 1990), which enhances his or her ability to identify more opportunities; prior knowledge provides an individual an increased creative
ability to generate more innovative opportunities (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Johnson,
Jamal, & Berryman, 1991). However, prior knowledge also acts as a motivator that diminishes the positive relationship between financial reward and these opportunity identification outcomes. Thus,
H3a: Prior knowledge moderates the relationship between potential financial reward
and opportunity identification: the less prior knowledge the more positive the
effect that potential financial reward has on the number of opportunities identified and the more prior knowledge the less positive the effect that potential
financial reward has on the number of opportunities identified.
H3b: Prior knowledge moderates the relationship between potential financial reward
and opportunity identification: the less prior knowledge the more positive the
effect that potential financial reward has on the innovativeness of the opportunities identified and the more prior knowledge the less positive the effect
that potential financial reward has on the innovativeness of the opportunities
identified.

Method
Overview
Experimental studies, which manipulate information about opportunities, have been
recommended as a possible approach to studying opportunities (Shane, 2000; Gaglio &
Katz, 2001). Gaglio and Katz (2001, p. 108) propose “. . . the experimental or quasi96

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->experimental approach opens up an interesting avenue for future research and for those
elements of entrepreneurial alertness that can be modeled in vignettes and simulations
such as sensitivity to signals of disequilibria.” Experimental studies are especially relevant to the study of opportunity identification because they allow researchers to control
extraneous variables, and focus on the identification of opportunities. In addition, these
studies avoid much of the bias (e.g., retrospective and self-reporting) associated with
survey studies.
This study uses an experimental approach (see Christensen, 2001; Cook &
Campbell, 1979) that manipulates conditions to enable the above hypotheses to be tested.
Participants were asked to read through a series of comments from focus groups regarding the underlying problems associated with footwear. Participants were then asked to
list the underlying problems that resulted from the focus group comments using only the
information that had been presented to them. After listing underlying problems, an offer
of a potential financial reward was made based upon their performance in listing solutions to the problems previously generated.
To measure the dependent variables of this study, the participants’ solutions were
evaluated by two raters based upon both the number of opportunities identified and
innovativeness of those opportunities. The use of raters to judge number of opportunities and innovativeness of opportunities is well established in the creativity literature
(Amabile, 1990). The independent variable of prior knowledge was created through the
manipulation of two experimental conditions: (1) an individual received either a considerable or a minimal amount of initial information regarding the problems at hand; and
(2) an individual received either considerable or minimal distraction to the processing of
that information. Together, these two manipulations created variability in prior knowledge. To measure this variability in prior knowledge, raters assessed the extent to which
the list of problems created by the participants acknowledged the five known categories
of underlying problems. This approach is consistent with that used by Coyle and Thorson
(2001).
Potential financial reward was simply manipulated by offering individuals a high or
low financial reward for their performance at the task, which is consistent with other
studies that have used the chance to win money as a way to motivate respondents (e.g.,
Lee, Herr, Kardes, & Kim, 1999; Maheswaran & Sternthal, 1990). Respondents were randomly assigned to the high/low reward manipulations. We now provide greater detail on
the sample, procedure, and operational definitions before providing details on the analysis and results.

Sample
The sample for this experiment was 78 MBA and executive MBA students at a large
university in Colorado, USA. Though there has been some criticism of the use of students as subjects in behavioral research (Copeland, Francia, & Strawser, 1973) and entrepreneurship specifically (Robinson, Huefner, & Hunt, 1991), studies have also shown that
graduate students are adequate surrogates for business decision makers in some situations (Khera & Benson, 1970). In addition, researchers (e.g. Gaglio & Katz, 2001: 108)
have noted that samples of MBA entrepreneurship students would be appropriate in
opportunity recognition “to produce reliable results about the cognitive processes of this
theoretically narrow topic.” In this study we manipulate and then capture prior knowledge of customer problems as part of the research method and therefore argue that the
use of MBA students is appropriate.

<-----Page 7----->Procedure
Introduction for Participants. Participants were first informed of the purpose of the
study and then the nature of the task: “The purpose of this research is to better understand the decision process of people in assessing the problems associated with a product.
It is hoped that this research will assist companies in their research and development
efforts and thereby improve firm performance.” Task: “In this study you will be asked to
evaluate a series of comments from a focus group. The focus group was asked to discuss
the ‘negatives’ involved in purchasing and/or using a particular product. When making
your evaluations, use only the information provided in this survey.”
The Focus Group Information. The focus group quotations provided information about
the underlying problems associated with footwear. Five categories of the underlying problems with footwear were determined by a marketing professor’s analysis of an actual
focus group and reported in a real business plan (i.e., Breeze Technology [Cadenhead
& Smilor, 1996]), namely: durability/quality, comfort, performance, style, and price.
Following is an example of focus group information where the underlying problem is
with style.
Person #1: I know it sounds shallow, but I don’t like the colors that are offered today.
I just can’t find a suitable match to the clothes that I wear.
Person #3: I don’t think that is shallow #1. In fact, the main reason that I buy Nike
running shoes is because of the brand name. People are impressed if you wear Nike,
or really, it is that they look at you strangely if you are wearing another brand.
Person #5: The shape is too bulky. They’re huge. They make my feet look too big.
I look like Krusty the clown.
Person #2: You know what I can’t stand? The runners get dirty so easily. They look
good while you are wearing them inside the house but as soon as you go outside once
or twice they look old.
Person #7: I agree with the comments made so far, most running, athletic, and outdoor
activity shoes just don’t look good. They are unattractive. They’re ugly.

Variables
Dependent Variables: Number and Innovativeness of Opportunities. As discussed
above, it is important for research into the identification of opportunities to not only
acknowledge the number of opportunities identified, but also the value of the opportunities (Amabile, 1990; Fiet, 2002; Hughes, 1963; Shane, 2000). Therefore, we had two
dependent variables to capture the identification of opportunities. The number of opportunities identified was operationalized by the sum of the number of opportunities as
counted by the raters. The inter-rater reliability between the raters using a Pearson bivariate correlation was .94 (p < .001). After a discussion between the raters full agreement
was reached.
The raters also assessed the list of solutions in terms of their innovativeness in overcoming each underlying cause of the problems listed recorded on a seven point scale
anchored by not very innovative and very innovative. The sum of the score on each of
the five areas (one for each underlying cause) represented the “innovativeness of the
opportunities” identified. The inter-rater reliability, using a Pearson bivariate correlation,
was .82 (p < .05), which is well within the expected range (Amabile, 1990). After a discussion between the raters, full agreement was reached.

98

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->Independent Variable for Prior Knowledge. Prior knowledge is a broad construct. Shane
(2000) proposes three types of prior knowledge that are important to the task of identifying opportunities: prior knowledge of markets, prior knowledge of ways to serve
markets, and prior knowledge of customer problems. We focus on manipulating and then
measuring prior knowledge of customer problems while controlling for the others. Prior
knowledge of customer problems was chosen because it captures aspects of the other
dimensions (knowledge of the market and ways to serve the market) and is argued to be
the primary reason why entrepreneurs start new companies (Von Hippel, 1988). Starting
a new company is an important entrepreneurial act that reflects the belief that the individual has identified an opportunity.
We manipulated the amount of information and the distraction to recall that information in order to generate variability within the sample in terms of prior knowledge of
customer problems. For a high amount of information respondents received 6–8 pieces
of information for each underlying dimension and were presented information on all five
underlying dimensions of customer problems. For a low amount of information respondents received 3–5 pieces of information for each underlying dimension and information
on only three of the five underlying problems.
For a high distraction to recall information, respondents received not only the focus
group comments on footwear, but also, on every alternating page, focus group comments
on transportation (a distraction). In addition, they were not allowed to create a list of problems as they progressed through the experiment, and they were not allowed to refer back
to any previous pages. Whereas for a low distraction to recall information, respondents
received only information about relevant customer problems (the footwear market), were
required to create a list of the underlying customer problems after the presentation of each
focus group discussion, and were encouraged to refer back to previous presentations of
focus group discussions and their previous lists of underlying customer problems.
This variability in prior knowledge was captured in a list of customer problems
created by the participants based upon the information provided. To determine each participant’s knowledge of the underlying problems customers have with footwear, two
raters assessed each participant’s list of problems to determine the extent to which they
acknowledged the five known categories of underlying causes for the problems associated with footwear detailed in the focus group’s discussions.
The raters used a seven point scale anchored by little acknowledgement and considerable acknowledgement for each of the five underlying causes. The level of prior knowledge of customer problems for an individual was the sum of these ratings across all five
dimensions. The inter-rater reliability, using a Pearson bivariate correlation, was .82 indicating consistency among raters. After discussion, the raters agreed on their ratings.
Therefore, although we used the above mentioned manipulations to create variability in
the variable (knowledge), the ratings provided a continuous variable to be used in subsequent analysis.
To operationalize prior knowledge of customer problems, we could have attempted to
capture the knowledge participants already had about the underlying causes of problems
associated with footwear, although we were concerned that there would be little variability within the sample. Alternatively, we could have simply used the manipulation of the
amount of information about footwear problems presented to the participant as a proxy for
prior knowledge, i.e., high or low amount of information provided. However, access to
more information does not necessarily lead to more knowledge. For example, information
overload can lead to diminished cognitive performance (Baron, 1998; Gilbert, McNulty,
Giuliano, & Benson, 1992). The information needs to be organized and stored to represent

January, 2005

<-----Page 9----->knowledge (Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Walsh, 1995). Therefore, while manipulating the
amount of information individuals receive will likely increase their knowledge, this may
not always be the case and therefore may not be an appropriate proxy.
In this quasi-experiment, we manipulated the amount of information and the individuals’ ability to recall that information and then captured their knowledge of customer
problems by assessing the degree to which self-reports reflect the underlying causes of
the problems customers have with footwear. These manipulations provide necessary variation in prior knowledge within the sample. Whether the variation occurred from the
manipulations or prior endowments does not matter. Such an approach is consistent with
Coyle and Thorson (2001), which also used an experimental design to manipulate two
conditions to create levels in its independent variables, and it is this variation in the independent variable that is measured and used in subsequent analyses.
Independent Variable for Potential Financial Reward. For high potential financial
reward, respondents were offered $50 for the best solution(s) whereas for low potential
financial reward, respondents were offered $1 for the best solution(s). The incentive was
left sufficiently broad to encompass both the total number and innovativeness of solutions.
Respondents were randomly assigned to the conditions. The chance to win money has been
used in many psychological studies to motivate respondents (e.g., Lee, Herr, Kardes, &
Kim, 1999; Maheswaran & Sternthal, 1990). A manipulation check asked respondents how
motivated they were by the potential financial reward on an eleven point scale anchored
by very low motivation to very high motivation. This check demonstrated that those individuals who were offered the chance to win $50 were more motivated than those offered
the chance to win $1 (ANOVA, p < .05).
Controls. Randomization of the participants across treatments controlled for other
individual differences that could have confounded the results, for example, personal differences in creativity, need for achievement, and desire to look good in front of the class.

Analysis and Results
We used hierarchical regression as the statistical technique to explain variance in
individuals’ opportunity identification. Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1. The
mean level of prior knowledge of customer problems across the sample is 6.45 (s.d. =
3.66). The mean total number of opportunities identified is 2.81 (s.d. = 1.82), and the
mean innovativeness of these opportunities is 4.31 (s.d. = 4.31). The inter-correlation
matrix in Table 1 indicates significant positive correlations between the two dependent
variables and between each dependent variable and prior knowledge of customer problems. Potential financial reward is significantly correlated to the number of opportunities
identified but not to the innovativeness of those opportunities and a weak (non-significant) correlation exists between the two independent variables. Collinearity diagnostics
indicate that the VIFs were below 10, which suggest that multicolinearity is unlikely to
have confounded the results.3

3. We used the three tests proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) to assess whether the relationship was moderation rather than mediation. Mediation was not supported because the prior knowledge of customer problems is not significantly correlated to financial reward (p > .05) and both financial reward and prior knowledge
of customer problems were significant when regressed against the number of opportunities discovered
(p < .05).

Number of Opportunities Identified
Table 2 reports the results of the hierarchical regression analyses with columns two,
three, four, and five reporting results for the number of opportunities as the dependent
variable and columns six, seven, eight, and nine for the innovativeness of opportunities.
The base model for the number of opportunities identified, which includes only the main
effects for potential financial reward and prior knowledge of customer problems,
explained a significant portion of the variance (R2 = .177, p < .01). The sign and significance of the individual regression coefficients suggests that both prior knowledge of
customer problems and potential financial reward are positively related to the number

of opportunities identified. This finding provides support for hypotheses 1a and 2a,
respectively.
The extended model, relative to the base model, significantly increased the amount
of variance explained—the DR2 is .075 (p < .01). These findings suggest that the prior
knowledge of customer problems potential financial reward interaction explains a significant amount of variance over and above that explained by the main effects.
To interpret the nature of the interaction, the relationship was plotted on a y-axis of
number of opportunities identified and an x-axis of potential financial reward for high
(one standard deviation above the mean) and low (one standard deviation below the
mean) prior knowledge of customer problems (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). The nature of the
interaction is illustrated in Figure 1 and reveals that for those with low prior knowledge
of customer problems, potential financial reward has a more positive relationship with
the number of opportunities identified than it does for those with high prior knowledge
of customer problems. This finding supports hypothesis 3a.

coefficients suggests that only prior knowledge of customer problems has a significant
relationship with the innovativeness of opportunities identified—the higher the prior
knowledge of customer problems the higher the innovativeness of the opportunities.
No significant relationship was found between potential financial reward and the innovativeness of opportunities identified. Therefore, hypothesis 1a was supported but 2a was
not.
The extended model, relative to the base model, significantly increased the amount
of variance explained in the innovativeness of opportunities identified—the DR2 is .164
(p < .01). Therefore the prior knowledge of customer problems x potential financial
reward interaction explains a significant amount of variance in the innovativeness of the
opportunities identified. To interpret the nature of the interaction, the relationship was
again plotted but this time with “innovativeness” on the y-axis. The plot, illustrated in
Figure 2, reveals that for those with lower prior knowledge of customer problems, potential financial reward has a more positive relationship with the innovativeness of opportunities identified than it does for those with less prior knowledge of customer problems.
This finding provides support for hypotheses 3b.

<-----Page 13----->Discussion and Future Research
Using the literature on entrepreneurship, cognition, and motivation, we concomitantly explored the joint effects of potential financial reward and prior knowledge of customer problems on the number of opportunities identified and the innovativeness of those
opportunities. Scholars of Austrian economics assert that potential financial reward motivates individuals to identify opportunities (Venkataraman, 1997). We found that this relationship may be more complex than this simple main-effect-only explanation. A deeper
analysis suggests that the nature of the relationship between potential financial reward
and opportunity identification differs among individuals based upon, at least in part,
differences in their prior knowledge of customer problems. Such a finding is consistent
with studies from the motivation literature that find the effect of potential financial
reward on motivation is influenced by the level of an individual’s knowledge (e.g.,
Csikszentmihayli, 1975, 2000; Maheswaran & Sternthal, 1990).
Our finding of a positive main-effect relationship between potential financial reward
and the number of opportunities identified is consistent with Gilad’s and Levine’s (1986,
p. 46) proposition that “the existence of attractive, potentially profitable business opportunities will attract and ‘pull’ alert individuals into entrepreneurial activities.” A number
of scholars have investigated the role that potential financial reward has in pulling people
into self-employment. Examples include the works of Shapero and Sokol (1982), Gilad
and Levine (1986), and Katz (1994).
Shapero and Sokol (1982) and others (e.g., Douglas & Shepherd, 2000; Vesper, 1990)
argue that the extent to which an individual will seek entrepreneurship depends upon both
pulls and pushes. “Pushes” refer to the negative aspects of an individual’s current situation. For example, a fixed income, the inability to earn a reward commensurate with the
effort/expertise required, and negative displacements all constitute factors that push
people into entrepreneurship. Therefore, the promise of a potential financial reward not
only “pulls” individuals into entrepreneurship, but the lack of a potential financial reward
in an individual’s current situation may also “push” individuals into entrepreneurship.
For most of the above-mentioned studies on “pushes,” entrepreneurship refers to selfemployment. We propose that the logic of the argument likely applies to an individual’s
motivation to identify opportunities. Further research should investigate the factors, other
than potential financial reward, that push and pull individuals to identify opportunities.
We also found that those with higher prior knowledge of customer problems identified more opportunities and opportunities with a higher degree of innovativeness. This is
consistent with the arguments of scholars investigating entrepreneurship from an Austrian economics perspective and with the cognition literature. But this may not apply to
other types of prior knowledge. The expertise literature has found that increasing experience can channel thoughts such that the experienced decision maker falls into mental
ruts (e.g., Fiske & Taylor, 1991). For example, prior knowledge of ways to serve the
market may channel the individual’s thought process along known paths, making creative thought unlikely, and therefore the identification of more innovative opportunities
more difficult. These mental ruts may make it more and more difficult for experienced
decision makers to recognize new variables or to notice that the environment has changed,
thus requiring new approaches (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). In this sense, increased
prior knowledge could make thinking “outside the box” more difficult and the identification of more innovative opportunities unlikely. Whether it benefits or diminishes performance appears to depend on the nature of the task being performed given the type of
knowledge that makes up that individual’s expertise (Shanteau, 1992; Spence & Brucks,
1997). Therefore, we argue that it is important for entrepreneurship scholars investigat104

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->ing the relationship between prior knowledge and the identification of opportunities to
distinguish between types of prior knowledge.
It is entirely possible that both perspectives are appropriate—prior knowledge leads
to the identification of more opportunities and opportunities with a higher degree of innovativeness, but over time and with tenure in a particular firm some individuals may allow
themselves to become entrenched in mental ruts. In fact, the relationship might be curvilinear where we anticipate an initial rise in number and innovativeness of opportunities,
followed by a leveling out and then a decline. Future research is encouraged to further
explore these relationships.
We also found a significant, positive correlation between the dependent variables.
Although this relationship does not confound our results (these variables were not used
in the same analysis), the finding is interesting because it suggests that the number of
opportunities generated and the innovativeness of opportunities have similar foundations.
This finding suggests that individuals who are able to brainstorm many solutions to problems have a higher tendency to find the most innovative solution. This finding reinforces
the previous research on brainstorming techniques (Osborn, 1957; Proctor, 1995) used in
creativity exercises, which are designed to develop as many ideas as possible within a
short period of time in order to find those ideas that are highly innovative.
Based upon entrepreneurship research using an Austrian economics perspective, we
investigated prior knowledge, specifically prior knowledge of customer problems, to
operationalize the competence to identify opportunities. Obviously, there are other competences that could moderate the relationship between potential financial reward and the
identification of opportunities. Immediate candidates for future research are other types
of prior knowledge, e.g., prior knowledge of markets and how to serve them (Shane,
2000). Other competences, such as an individual’s social network could also provide
additional insight into the identification of opportunities (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986;
Granovetter, 1985; Singh, Hills, Hybels, & Lumpkin, 1999). Not only are other types of
competences worthy of scholars’ future attention, but also how the reward-competence
interaction might differ when potential non-financial rewards are investigated as
possible incentives.
This study has a number of limitations. First, there could be differences in the way
that individuals brainstorm solutions and innovations. While we did not specifically ask
participants to brainstorm for innovation, they were told that the purpose of the study
related to assisting companies in their research and development efforts and thereby
improve firm performance. Also when asked to generate solutions, guidance was offered
to brainstorm for innovation: “. . . propose possible solutions to your list of problems.
These solutions might include a change in design, appearance, process, technology, etc.”
However, this distinction could be further elaborated upon in future research.
Second, we offered one sufficiently broad, potential financial reward to provide
incentive for both the number and innovativeness of opportunities identified. The use of
two potential financial measures—one for the number of opportunities identified and one
for the innovativeness—would provide a more precise manipulation of the variable.
Third, we have assumed that the concept of motivation from a potential financial
reward is a continuous variable rather than one with only two levels—on and off. The
current study does not provide the opportunity to test whether our assumption is accurate. Threshold theory (e.g., Chandrashekaran, McNeilly, Russ, & Marinova, 2000;
Rambo & Pinto, 1989) might provide a theoretical framework for further research into
the relationship between potential financial reward and the motivated propensity to identify opportunities. For example, maybe an individual’s motivation to identify opportunities is switched on when the potential financial reward exceeds some threshold value.
January, 2005

105

<-----Page 15----->What determines an individual’s threshold value would then become an important
research question.
Fourth, the use of experimental design methodology has been questioned as to its
external validity (e.g., Oakes, 1972). External validity refers to “the extent to which
results can be applied to and across different persons, settings, and times” (Christensen,
2001, p. 360). There is an inherent trade-off in experimental research between internal
validity and external validity (Kazdin, 1980). Experiments, through their inherent ability
to control extraneous variables, often have high internal validity at the expense of external validity. We acknowledge that the generalizability of these results are to the population of MBA students in a specific region of the country and that further research must
be conducted to determine if these results are generalizable to the majority of entrepreneurs. For example, the MBA student sample had considerable variability in the level of
prior knowledge due to the experimental manipulations, but perhaps there is less variation among entrepreneurs who mostly have high levels of prior knowledge. Given the
results presented above, we would then expect a sample of entrepreneurs to be less motivated by financial rewards than would a sample of MBA students.
Finally, a cognitive approach requires potential financial reward and prior knowledge
to be perceived by the individual. We used objective measures for these variables. While
in this experiment objective and subjective measures are likely to be highly correlated,
future research should more explicitly capture the perceived desirability of the potential
financial reward and perceived prior knowledge. For example, such research could rely
on the self-efficacy literature to better understand the relationship between individuals’
perceived competence at identifying opportunities and the actual number and innovativeness of opportunities identified.

Conclusion
This article makes an important contribution to our understanding of the identification of opportunities. First, we have shown that the higher the potential financial reward
the greater the number of opportunities identified, although these opportunities are not
necessarily more innovative. Second, we have shown that the level of an individual’s
prior knowledge increased the number of opportunities identified and the innovativeness
of those opportunities. Finally, and most important to the study of opportunities, we found
that potential financial reward provides motivation for individuals with little prior knowledge of customer problems to identify opportunities, but it provides minimal motivation
for those who have considerable prior knowledge of customer problems.
