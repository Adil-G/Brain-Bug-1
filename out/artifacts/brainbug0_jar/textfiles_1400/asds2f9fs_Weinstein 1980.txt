Unrealistic Optimism About Future Life Events
Neil D. Weinstein
Department of Human Ecology and Social Sciences
Cook College, Rutgers—The State University
Two studies investigated the tendency of people to be unrealistically optimistic
about future life events. In Study 1, 258 college students estimated how much
their own chances of experiencing 42 events differed from the chances of their
classmates. Overall, they rated their own chances to be above average for positive events and below average for negative events, ps<.001. Cognitive and
motivational considerations led to predictions that degree of desirability, perceived probability, personal experience, perceived controllability, and stereotype
salience would influence the amount of optimistic bias evoked by different
events. All predictions were supported, although the pattern of effects differed
for positive and negative events. Study 2 tested the idea that people are unrealistically optimistic because they focus on factors that improve their own
chances of achieving desirable outcomes and fail to realize that others may have
just as many factors in their favor. Students listed the factors that they thought
influenced their own chances of experiencing eight future events. When such
lists were read by a second group of students, the amount of unrealistic optimism shown by this second group for the same eight events decreased significantly, although it was not eliminated.
According to popular belief, people tend to
think they are invulnerable. They expect
others to be victims of misfortune, not themselves. Such ideas imply not merely a hopeful
outlook on life, but an error in judgment that
can be labeled unrealistic optimism.
It is usually impossible to demonstrate that
an individual's optimistic expectations about
the future are unrealistic. An individual might
be quite correct in asserting that his or her
chances of experiencing a negative event are
less than average. On a group basis, however,
it is relatively easy to test for an optimistic
bias. If all people claim their changes of experiencing a negative event are less than

average, they are clearly making a systematic
error, thus demonstrating unrealistic optimism.
Various data suggest that people do tend
to be unrealistically optimistic about the
future. Surveys concerning automobile accidents (Robertson, 1977), crime (Weinstein,
Note 1), and disease (Harris & Guten, 1979;
Kirscht, Haefner, Kegeles, & Rosenstock,
1966; American Cancer Society, Note 2) find
many people who say their risk is less than
average but few who say their risk is greater
than average. When people are asked to predict the outcomes of social and political issues,
their predictions tend to coincide with their
preferences (Cantril, 1938; Lund, 1925;
McGregor, 1938; McGuire, 1960). Even for
purely chance events (picking a card out of
a deck, for example), people sometimes show

was to test the following hypothesis:
1. People believe that negative events are less
likely to happen to them than to others, and
they believe that positive events are more likely
to happen to them than to others.
In addition, the two studies described here
tested several specific hypotheses about the
factors that influence the amount of optimistic bias evoked by different events and
about the mechanisms that produce this bias.
Event Characteristics Affecting
Optimism

Unrealistic

In past research, optimistic biases were
generally regarded as evidence of defensiveness or wishful thinking. People were said to
exaggerate the likelihood of events the anticipation of which produces positive affect and
underestimate the likelihood of events the
anticipation of which produces negative affect.
Presumably, the stronger the affect, the
stronger the distortion of reality. This motivational analysis of expectations about future
life events suggests the second hypothesis:
2. Among negative events, the more undesirable the event, the stronger the tendency to
believe that one's own chances are less than
average; among positive events, the more desirable the event, the stronger the tendency to
believe that one's own chances are greater than
average.
Supporting this degree of desirability/undesirability prediction, Kirscht et al. (1966)
reported that judgments of disease susceptibility were correlated with perceptions of
disease severity. The people who regarded a
disease as very serious were the ones most
likely to believe that their own chances were
less than average. No data or significance
levels were given, however.
In recent years, explanations that emphasize flaws in the information handling
capabilities of human beings have been advanced for phenomena once explained in
motivational terms (e.g., Miller & Ross,
1975; Ross, Greene, & House, 1977; Slovic,
Kunreuther, & White, 1974). According to
this perspective, people may be unrealistically
optimistic because they lack certain informa-

807

tion needed to make accurate risk assessments
or use procedures to judge future probabilities
that introduce systematic errors.
In making comparative risk assessments,
errors may arise because people have difficulty
in adopting the perspective of others (cf.
Jones & Nisbett, 1971; Ross et al., 1977;
Ross & Sicoly, 1979). Many of the factors
that make us feel that an event is likely or
unlikely to happen to us may also make
other people feel that it is likely or unlikely
to happen to them. If people focus only on
their own circumstances, they may conclude
incorrectly that their chances differ from
those of other people. Through this mechanism, any factor that influences people's beliefs
about their own chances could influence comparative judgments. One factor that will
affect these beliefs is the perceived probability of the event for the general population.
The preceding reasoning then suggests the
hypothesis:
3. The greater the perceived probability of an
event, the stronger the tendency for people to
believe that their own chances are greater than
average.
Another factor that should influence people's beliefs about their chances of experiencing
an event is past personal experience (Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, & Combs,
1978; Hoffman & Brewer, Note 3). Personal
experience should make it easier to recall past
occurrences of the event and to imagine situations in which the event could occur, leading
to greater perceived probability through the
mechanism of "availability" (Tversky &
Kahneman, 1973, 1974). Furthermore, for
many events causal sequences can be constructed which imply that past experience
increases the probability of future experience.
Someone who has had a heart attack or has
close relatives with heart disease is more
likely to have a heart attack in the future
than someone who has had no contact with
heart ailments. Consequently, we predict:
4. Previous personal experience with an event
increases the likelihood that people will believe
their own chances are greater than average.
Hypotheses 3 and 4 concern two event
characteristics that may lead people to make

<-----Page 2----->808

NEIL D. WEINSTEIN

systematic errors when comparing their own
chances with those of other people, but they
do not explain the phenomenon of unrealistic
optimism. The direction of the errors produced
by these characteristics depends on the probability of the event and the frequency of
personal experience, not on the type of event.
To explain why people would say that their
chances are greater than average for positive
events but less than average for negative
events by using these hypotheses would require that positive events always be associated with high probability or high personal
experience and that negative events always
be associated with low probability or low
personal experience.
There is a way, however, in which egocentric tendencies can produce an optimistic
bias for both positive and negative events.
If an event is perceived to be controllable,
it signifies that people believe there are steps
one can take to increase the likelihood of a
desirable outcome. Because they can more
easily bring to mind their own actions than
the actions of others, people are likely to
conclude that desired outcomes are more
likely to happen to them than to other people.
Even for events that are far in the future
and have not yet been associated with any
overt behavior, people may still be aware of
their intentions to act in ways that will help
them achieve the desired outcomes.
The preceding argument assumes that people
generally bring to mind actions that facilitate
rather than impede goal achievement. They
might do this because facilitating actions
really are more plentiful, because they find
reassurance in selectively recalling facilitating
actions or in exaggerating their importance
(a motivational explanation), or because
actions taken to produce desired outcomes
are, for various reasons, actually easier to
remember (a cognitive viewpoint).
Since the process just outlined would not
apply to uncontrollable events, we are led to
the prediction:
5. The greater the perceived controllability of
a negative event, the greater the tendency for
people to believe that their own chances are less
than average; the greater the perceived controllability of a positive event, the greater the
tendency for people to believe that their own
chances are greater than average.

The final event characteristic to be examined was suggested by the "representativeness"
heuristic (Kahneman & Tversky, 1972; Tversky & Kahneman, 1977). Representativeness
denotes the process of judging the probability
that an individual fits into a particular category by examining the degree to which the
individual displays a few salient features of
category members but ignoring base rates for
the categories. For many events—contracting
lung cancer and becoming an alcoholic, for
example—people may have a stereotyped
conception of the kind of person to whom
this event happens. If they do not see themselves as fitting the stereotype, the representativeness heuristic suggests that people
will conclude that the event will not happen
to them, overlooking the possibility that few
of the people who experience the event may
actually fit the stereotype.
If stereotypes of the victim tend to serve
an ego-defensive function, people would seldom
see themselves as representing the type of
person who falls prey to misfortune. Furthermore, if stereotypes are defensive, an individual's image of the people who experience
positive events would overemphasize his or
her own characteristics. These tendencies
would exaggerate optimistic biases for any
event associated with a stereotype.
A different line of reasoning does not assume any motivational bias in the construction or use of stereotypes. It suggests that
people may be struck by the superficial differences between themselves and the stereotype
(differences such as sex, age, or appearance)
and fail to see more fundamental similarities
between themselves and the people to whom
the event occurs. This would lead people to
conclude that the event will not happen to
them, producing optimism for negative events
but pessimism for positive events.
The final hypothesis states:
6. When a stereotype exists of a particular
type of person to whom a negative event is likely
to happen, people will tend to believe that their
own chances are less than average. (No clear
prediction can be made from the preceding
discussion about the effects of stereotype
salience on expectations for positive events.)
The preceding hypotheses can each be
reached by several lines of reasoning, often
involving both motivational and cognitive

<-----Page 3----->UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM ABOUT FUTURE LIFE EVENTS

considerations. Personal experience, for example, might decrease optimism about negative events by making images of the events
more available or by undercutting defensive
denial. Consequently, these hypotheses are
not offered as a test of motivational versus
cognitive points of view or as an examination of
the importance of availability and representativeness in generating unrealistic optimism.
Study 1 was designed to test the hypotheses
themselves. Its goal was to determine the
amount of unrealistic optimism associated
with different events and to relate this optimism to the characteristics of the events.

words, if the judgments students generate are
unbiased and the students form a representative sample of the population, the mean value
of their comparative judgments should be zero.
If the mean of their judgments is significantly
different from zero, it indicates that their
judgments have a systematic bias. Whenever
the mean value of students' comparative
judgments departs significantly from zero in
an optimistic direction, this will be interpreted
as unrealistic optimism, and the size of the
mean will be taken as a measure of the magnitude of the optimistic bias.
Method

Study 1
In this study college students estimated
how much their own chances of experiencing
future life events differed from the average
chances of their classmates. If all students
claimed that their chances of experiencing a
negative event were less than average (or
that their chances of experiencing a positive
event were greater than average), this would
clearly indicate unrealistic optimism. However, a simple comparison of the numbers of
optimistic and pessimistic responses is not
sufficient to demonstrate a systematic bias.
Unless the median and the mean of the
actual probability distribution happen to coincide, there is no reason why the number of
people whose chances are below the average
(below the mean) should equal the number
whose chances are above the average. If the
probability distribution is positively skewed,
for example, most people's chances will be
below the average.
To determine the presence of a systematic
bias we have to consider the degree of optimism or pessimism expressed. The comparative judgments students were asked to make
in the present studies concern the difference
between their own individual chances and the
population average. (The population, as denned here, included all the other students at
the same college.) Mathematically, this difference is (Pi — P), where Pt is the probability that the event will happen to a particular
individual and P is the population mean of P,-.1
Because P is defined as the average of P,
over the population, the mean value of this
difference score ought to be zero. In other

Subjects
One group of students made comparative judgments
about the likelihood that specific events would take
place in their lives (comparative rating group). These
subjects were enrolled in two interdisciplinary courses
at Cook College, Rutgers University, that attract an
extremely diverse group of students.
Event characteristics were rated by a group of 120
female students (event rating group) from an introductory psychology course at the same university
These students also served as the subjects in Study 2.

Materials
Events. The 18 positive and 24 negative life events
used in the study are listed in Table 1. The intention
was to assemble a diverse group of events that satisfied two criteria. First, each event had to be clearly
positive or negative. Second, there could be no obvious precondition that would make any event relevant
to only a limited number of people. For example, the
event "being injured while skiing" would be inappropriate because it only applies to people who choose
to ski.
Comparative rating forms. The 42 events were divided randomly between two rating forms. Positive
and negative events were intermixed. Instructions on
the forms stated "Compared to other Cook students—
same sex as you—what do you think are the chances
that the following events will happen to you? The
choices range from much less than average, through
average, to much more than average" (italics in
original). Beneath the description of each event were
the following choices: "100% less (no chance), 80%
less, 60% less, 40% less, 20% less, 10% less, average,
10% more, 20% more, 40% more, 60% more, 80%

1

Actually subjects expressed this difference as a
percentage of the average chances—100 X (Pi — P)/P.
Estimating the percentage difference is easier and
more natural for students and does not alter the
interpretation of their responses.

more, 100% more, 3 times average, and 5 times
average." The lowest choice possible was 100% less
than average, since this indicated a probability of zero.
At the other extreme, no probability could exceed
100%, but this upper limit could be many times the
average probability. The task of comparing one's own
chances with the average chances of other students
was readily accepted by students and carried out
without any apparent confusion.
To calculate the mean comparative judgment, the
15 response choices were given the values —100%,
-80%,
-60%, -40%, -20%, -10%, 0%, 10%,
20%, 40%, 60%,, 80%, 100%, 200%, and 400% to
reflect their deviation from a response of "average."
Kvent ratings. For the rating of event characteristics, events were divided into the same sets as on the
comparative rating forms. Written instructions asked
subjects to evaluate first the probability of each event.
Students were required to estimate the percentage of
students at the university to whom the event would
occur. Several examples were presented to illustrate
the relationship between percentage ratings and odds
ratios. Next, events were rated for controllability
(1 = there is nothing one can do that will change
the likelihood that the event will take place, 2 = things
one can do have a small effect on the chances that
the event will occur; 3 = things one can do have
a moderate effect; 4 = things one can do have a large
effect; S = completely controllable) and desirability
(1 = extremely undesirable; 3 = undesirable; 5 = neutral; 7 = desirable; 9 = extremely desirable). Finally,
events were rated for personal experience (1 = has not
happened to anyone I know; 2 = has happened to
acquaintances; 3 = has happened to friends or close
relatives; 4 = has happened to me once; 5 = has
happened to me more than once) and salience of a
high chance group (1 = no type of person with a particularly high chance comes to mind; 2 = when I think
about the event a type of person comes to mind to
whom it is likely to happen, but this image is not
very clear; 3 = when I think about the event a clear
picture comes to mind of a particular type of person
to whom it is likely to happen).

and negative events was achieved. The least
undesirable of all the negative events was
still perceived to be relatively undesirable
(M = 3.92), and the least desirable of all the
positive events was still perceived to be relatively desirable (M = 6.37). Both values are
significantly different from the neutral rating
of 5 (ps < .001).2
Unrealistic Optimism: Hypothesis 1
Both positive and negative events in Table 1
are arranged in order of decreasing optimism
as indicated by the mean comparative judgment. A positive value in Column 1 indicates
that subjects tend to believe that their own
chances are greater than average; a negative
value indicates that students believe their
chances are less than average. These values
strongly support Hypothesis 1; the means in
Column 1 are in the predicted direction for 37
of the 42 events (p < .001 by the binomial
test). Averaged over all positive events, the
comparative judgments of individuals were
significantly greater than zero, M = 15.4%,
^(255) = 6.8, p < .001; averaged over negative events, individuals' judgments were significantly less than zero, M = -20.4%, /(255)
= 13.9, p < .001.
Column 2 shows the ratio of the number
of optimistic to pessimistic responses. Although
the significance levels derived from the statistics in Columns 1 and 2 differ for a few events,
the existence of strong optimistic tendencies
is clear in both. The correlation between the
ratio in Column 2 and the values in Column 1
was .90 for both positive and negative events. 3

Procedure
The experimenter visited the classes selected for
the comparative rating measure and explained that
the project concerned college students' expectations
about the future. Task instructions emphasized that
subjects should compare themselves with other students and not merely rate each event in terms of how
likely or unlikely it seemed. The different versions
of the comparative rating form, each listing 21 events,
were handed to alternate students.
The ratings of the event characteristics were completed separately by members of the event rating
group after their participation in Study 2.

Results
The ratings of event characteristics showed
that a clear differentiation between positive

two-tailed.

The possibility that artifacts might have been
introduced by the use of a response scale with unequal
intervals was tested by ignoring the response labels
and simply treating the choices as a 15-point, equalinterval scale. The insensitivity of the results to such
changes is indicated by the correlation of .98 between
event means from this new scale and the mean values
from Column 1. In addition, a pilot study examined
a simple scale labeled: "1—below average, 2—slightly
below average, 3—average, 4—slightly above average,
and 5—above average." This scale was completed by
98 members of an introductory psychology class for
IS of the events included in the present study. A correlation of .91 was found between the mean rating
of the events on this S-point scale and the values in
the first column of Table 1.

An additional calculation tested whether
differences in comparative judgments for positive and negative events might have been
caused by unintended differences in the perceived probability, personal experience, perceived controllability, or stereotype salience
of the two types of events. To control for
the possible effects of such differences, the
partial correlation was calculated between the
mean comparative judgments (Column 1) and
event type (a dummy variable differentiating
between positive and negative events; —1
= negative event; 1 = positive event) controlling for these four other variables. The
significant result (r = .74, p < .001) demonstrates that event type has a powerful effect
independent of the effects of the other event
characteristics.
Event Characteristics Influencing
Optimism: Hypotheses 2-6

Unrealistic

It is clear from Table 1 that the amount
of unrealistic optimism evoked by different
events varied greatly. In many cases the
mean comparative judgment was not significantly different from zero, indicating the
absence of a significant optimistic bias. Hypotheses 2 through 6 attempt to explain these
variations. They were each tested separately
by means of a linear model that included the
terms event type (positive or negative), event
characteristic (the mean rating for the characteristic cited in the hypothesis; median
probability ratings were used because of the
large variability of these estimates), and Type
X Characteristic interaction. (Hypothesis 6
makes a specific prediction only for negative
events and was tested by a separate correlation coefficient for each type of event.)4
The event characteristic term in the models
tests whether the pooled within-type regression coefficient for that characteristic is significantly different from zero. The Type X
Characteristic interaction tests whether the
regression lines for positive and negative
events have the same slope.r> The data for
these analyses consisted of the mean comparative judgments for the 42 events, the
mean characteristic ratings, and the type
designations. Consequently, significance tests
refer to the null hypothesis that the effects

are zero in the larger population of events
from which the present sample was drawn."
The significance levels for the event characteristic terms and the magnitudes of the corresponding pooled within-type correlation coefficients are shown in the first column of

' The dependent variable in the models that tested
the contributions of degree of desirability, perceived
probability, and personal experience was the mean
comparative judgment from Column 1 of Table 1.
Hypothesis 5, however, was phrased differently, predicting a positive association between perceived controllability and optimism. Therefore, the dependent
variable in the test of this hypothesis was the degree
of optimism produced. For positive events, the mean
comparative judgment indicates the size of the optimistic bias, but for negative events, the measure of
optimistic bias was obtained by reversing the sign
of the mean comparative judgment.
6
If the analysis found no appreciable Type X Characteristic interaction (p > .2), the event characteristic
effect was estimated after first removing the event
type sum of squares from the total sum of squares.
If a Type X Characteristic effect did appear to be
present (p < .2), both event type and Type X Characteristic sums of squares were removed before estimating the event characteristic effect. The latter
procedure was needed only for degree of desirability,
interaction F(\, 38) = 1.91, p = .18, and perceived
controllability, interaction F(\, 38) = 3.23, p < .08.
6
Because the data were analyzed on an event basis,
with variables averaged over all subjects, it was not
necessary for the same individuals to rate both the
event characteristics and their own chances of experiencing the events. What was necessary was that
the perceptions of the event characteristics and the
amount of personal experience with these events be
essentially the same for the comparative rating group
and the event rating group. In addition to the fact
that all subjects were students at the same university,
there are several specific indications that this condition was satisfied. In a pilot study, a mixed-sex group
of students from another of the special interdisciplinary courses from which subjects in Study 1 were
drawn rated 21 of the events in Table 1 on three
of the dimensions used here. Correlations between the
pilot ratings and those utilized in Study 1 were:
controllability, .78; desirability, .98; and probability,
.50 (.54 among positive events and .80 among negative
events). Thus, ratings seem unlikely to change greatly
from one group to another, although probability
ratings do seem to be somewhat variable. It was also
found that the relationships between event characteristics (rated by females) and comparative judgments
were the same when the judgments of male and female
members of the comparative rating group were examined separately. Apparently the event characteristic ratings were equally relevant to males and
females.

Table 2. Separate correlations for positive
and negative events are presented in Columns
2 and 3. The figures show that all of the
correlations predicted by Hypotheses 2-6 were
in the predicted direction and that all of the
event characteristic terms were statistically
significant. Columns 2 and 3, however, reveal
different patterns of associations for positive
and negative events. (Differences in the sizes
of the positive event'and negative event correlation coefficients were statistically significant only for perceived probability, p < .06,
and stereotype salience, p < .05.) For positive
events, perceived probability and degree of
desirability were significantly correlated with
the amount of optimistic bias; for negative
events, the correlations with stereotype salience, perceived controllability, and personal
experience were significant.
Multiple Regression Analyses
Further calculations revealed significant
correlations between two pairs of event characteristics: between stereotype salience and
perceived controllability, .69 and .78 for positive and negative events, respectively, and
between perceived probability and personal
experience, .53 and .57 for positive and negative events, respectively (cf. Lichtenstein et
al., 1978). Since these event characteristics are
interrelated, the significant correlations in
Table 2 do not necessarily identify inde-

pendent predictors or unrealistic optimism.
To examine this issue further, multiple regression analyses were carried out for positive
and negative events to predict the size of the
optimistic bias from event characteristics.
Since the number of degrees of freedom in
these calculations was quite small, however,
the statistical power was necessarily low, and
conclusions reached from these multivariate
analyses must remain tentative.
In a stepwise regression for positive events,
perceived probability (p < .001) and degree
of desirability (/><.!) entered the prediction
equation, R = .79, F(2,15) = 12.55, p < .001.
With all five variables entered, however, only
the contribution of perceived probability was
still statistically significant (p < .02). For
negative events, stereotype salience (/> < .001)
and personal experience (/> < .02) entered the
stepwise prediction equation, R = .82, F(2, 21)
= 22.74, p < .001. With all five variables,
only stereotype salience was still significant
(p < .005). The failure of perceived controllability to appear in the negative event
equation was clearly due to its very high
correlation with stereotype salience.
Discussion
The present data provide evidence of unrealistic optimism for both positive and negative life events. As expected, the magnitude
of this optimistic bias varied from event to

<-----Page 8----->814

event, but most of the variability could be
explained by reference to a few dimensions
on which the events differed.
Although all six hypotheses posed in the
introduction were supported, different factors
appeared to govern responses to positive and
negative events. For negative events, optimism, perceived controllability, and stereotype
salience were all strongly intercorrelated.
When an event was judged to be controllable,
a stereotype existed in subjects' minds of the
kind of person to whom the event generally
occurred. Presumably, this person was believed
to be at risk because he or she failed to take
any action to control the risk. Subjects seemed
to compare themselves with the stereotypic
victim, leading them to conclude that their
own risks were less than average. For events
perceived to be uncontrollable, there was no
stereotype of the victim, and subjects did not
show any systematic bias.
In retrospect, some of the different correlations for positive events are not surprising.
It seems likely that everyone would want to
avoid the negative events in this study; yet
just because the result of an event is desirable
does not mean that everyone is committed
to achieving that result. For example, an
award for community service may be very
attractive, but it may be a goal for very few
people. The finding that optimism was not
greater among the positive events judged to
be controllable or found to be associated with
a stereotypic, high-chance group may simply
reflect the fact that many subjects were not
attempting to control (i.e., influence) these
events.
This same explanation may account for the
strong correlation for positive events between
perceived probability and comparative judgments. Examination of the positive events
in Table 1 suggests that the high probability
events are the only ones likely to be widely
accepted as personal goals. Subjects are presumably working toward these goals, and
because their efforts should increase the likelihood that they will succeed, they mistakenly
conclude that their prospects are better than
average. Of course, one can only work toward
a goal if the outcome is somewhat controllable,
and in fact, the high probability positive
events in the study were also relatively high

in controllability. 7 There is no obvious reason
why personal experience and degree of desirability were significant for one type of event
but not the other.
Thus, for both positive and negative events,
an optimistic bias appears to result when two
conditions are satisfied. First, the event is
perceived to be controllable, so that there are
things one can do or contemplate doing to
influence the event. Second, people have some
degree of commitment or emotional investment in the outcome. Under these conditions,
optimism arises because people compare themselves with an inappropriate standard: a person
who does little or nothing to improve his or
her prospects.
Contrary to expectations based on a motivational interpretation of optimism, degree of
desirability had no appreciable effect on the
size of the optimistic bias for negative events.
In fact, optimism was not appreciably greater
for the seven life threatening events in the
sample—numbers 20, 22, 25, 28, 38, 39, and 42
(M =— 20.4%)—than for the other negative
events (M = -19.5%).
Study 2
Previously it was suggested that people may
be optimistically biased because their image
of other people is inaccurate or incomplete.
Aware of the factors that improve their own

7
The proposed difference in commitment between
the positive and negative events in this study was
subjected to a preliminary test. A mixed-sex group
of students from Cook College (n = 64) rated all
events on a scale that ranged from 1 (not at all important to me whether or not the event occurs) to 4
(quite important to me whether or not the event
occurs). It was expected that: (a) negative events
would be rated higher in importance than positive
events; (b) importance would be positively correlated
with optimism for both positive and negative events;
and (c) for positive events, importance would be
strongly related to event probability. The results
strongly supported all three predictions. Mean ratings
of importance for negative and positive events were
3.22 and 2.58, respectively, <(40) = 4.05, p < .001.
The correlation of importance with optimism was .62
(p < .01) for positive events, and .46 (p < .025) for
negative events. Finally, importance and probability
were strongly correlated for positive events, .63
(p < .01), but uncorrelated for negative events
(-.22, ns).

<-----Page 9----->UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM ABOUT FUTURE LIFE EVENTS

chances of achieving desirable outcomes, they
may not realize that others may have just as
many factors in their favor. The different
conditions created in Study 2 were designed
to manipulate subjects' awareness of the
factors that other people consider when estimating their chances of experiencing various
events.
Subjects in Study 2 made written lists of
the factors that increase or decrease the
likelihood that specific events would happen
to them. (It was hypothesized that people
normally prepare similar mental lists when
making comparative judgments, so requiring
subjects to prepare such lists was not expected
to influence their optimism.) Some subjects
were then given copies of the lists generated
by others and asked to make comparative
judgments of their chances of experiencing
these events as in Study 1. It was predicted
that exposure to others' lists would decrease
and perhaps eliminate subjects' optimistic
biases. Furthermore, since participants in this
experiment both made comparative judgments
and listed the event-influencing reasons, it was
possible to examine the relationship between
these two variables at the individual level.
One other variable was added to the experiment to examine the possibility that subjects in Study 1 were incorrectly reporting
the perceived likelihood that events would
happen to them rather than the relative
likelihood using their peers as a comparison
group. Half of the subjects in each condition
of Study 2 were explicitly warned about
making this mistake and received suggestions
designed to help them remember to make
comparative judgments.
Method
Subjects
Students in this experiment were 120 female members of an introductory psychology class at Rutgers
University who participated to fulfill a course requirement.

Materials
Comparative rating booklets. A booklet was prepared containing many of the events that had evoked
unrealistic optimism in Study 1. The booklet was
divided into three parts (pretreatment events, treatment events and posttreatment events) that were

815

similar in the numbers of positive and negative events
and the amount of optimistic bias that had been
produced by these events. The exact sequence of
events (using identification numbers from Table 1)
was: 8, 24, 40, 13, 23, 30, 1, 22, and 27 (pretreatment
events); 31, 2, 19, 25, 32, 3, 21, and 26 (treatment
events); and 10, 34, 38, 11, 28, 36, 4, 20, and 29
(posttreatment events). The response format was unchanged from Study 1.
A cover sheet on half of the booklets was entitled
Warning. It stated: "It's easy to forget the directions
and start to respond to events in terms of how likely
they are INSTEAD of how likely they are for you compared to other students . . . . Don't do that." A specific example was then given. The warning concluded:
"To help you keep this in mind, when you sec the
choice '40% more,' think of it as 'my chances are
40% more than other students'.' "
Own reasons lists. Subjects generated lists of the
factors that tend to increase or decrease the chances
that the eight treatment events would happen to
them. A detailed instruction sheet requested subjects
to "think of things you do now and things you might
do in the future" and to think of any personal characteristics—"including your personality, abilities, physical characteristics, attitudes, etc."—that would influence the chance of this event happening to them.
Others' reasons packets. During the first day of the
experiment only control groups were tested. Multiple
copies of the lists of personal reasons prepared by
these groups were prepared. The packets of others'
reasons given to subjects in the experimental group
were then made up. Each packet contained five lists
chosen at random from among the 19 lists that had
been reproduced. Twenty-five different packets were
prepared in this way. This random-selection procedure
assured that, on the average, the reasons read by
subjects in the experimental group were just as numerous and as optimistic as the reasons they listed
themselves.

Procedure
Three different conditions were created, one experimental condition and two controls. During every
session, two of the three conditions were conducted
simultaneously in adjacent rooms by different experimenters. Subjects arriving for the study were assigned
randomly to one of these conditions. All subjects
worked independently.
The experimenters' introductory instructions were
essentially the same as those in Study 1. Subjects in
all conditions then made comparative judgments for
the pretreatment events. Next, members of the experimental group (n — 39) were told, "We want to
get your thoughts about the factors that increase or
decrease the chances that certain events will happen
to you," and they were given a blank form on which
to list their own reasons concerning the treatment
events. Then experimental group subjects received
one of the packets of others' reasons for these same
events along with the explanation: "These forms were
taken at random from people who were in our study

in the past. Each set is different. Their ideas may be
helpful to you in estimating how your chances compare to others', but keep in mind that you're supposed to compare yourself with all Rutgers females,
not just these five." Finally, experimental group subjects made comparative judgments for the treatment
events and for the posttreatment events.
Control Group 1 (» = 41) was employed to test
whether just listing one's own reasons might influence
the degree of optimism expressed on treatment events.
Their procedure differed from the experimental group
only in that they did not receive the packet of others'
reasons. Members of Control Group 2 (n = 40) made
comparative judgments without either generating
their own lists of reasons or seeing lists produced by
other students. Subjects in Control Group 2 did,
however, list their own reasons for the treatment
events after they finished the comparative rating
booklet.
Half of the subjects in each group received a comparative rating booklet with the cover sheet warning
them to make comparative judgments. To conclude
the sessions, participants in all conditions rated the
characteristics of 21 events as described in Study 1.

Results and Discussion
Effects

of Experimental Treatments

Mean comparative judgments are presented
in Table 3 for each of the. three groups in the
study. Figures are given for each set of events,
and values for positive and negative events
are presented separately.

The data were first examined by an analysis
of variance that included the variables group,
warning, and event set. Event set was a
within-subject variable, whereas group and
warning were between-subjects variables. Positive and negative events were tested separately.
The calculations revealed that the warning
manipulation main effects and interactions
were not significant, ps > .2. Apparently,
even without the extra reminder, subjects
understood the comparative nature of the
task and tried to compare their own chances
with those of other students.
In contrast, Group X Event Set interactions for both negative and positive events
were statistically significant, F(4, 227) = 2.80,
p < .05, and jF(4, 227) = 2.48, p < .05, respectively. These interactions show that the
experimental treatments did change the responses of the experimental groups. These
changes were studied in additional analyses
that treated pretreatment event responses as
covariates and tested for group differences on
treatment and posttreatment events (Huck
& McLean, 1975). These calculations showed
that the manipulations produced group differences on negative and positive treatment
events, F(2, 116) = 6.20, p < .005, and
F(2, 116) = 5.06, p < .01, respectively. Comparisons among the covariance adjusted negative events means (SAS Institute, 1979)
indicated that the experimental group was
significantly less optimistic than the two
control groups (/>s < .005), and that the
control groups did not differ from one another
(p > .2). For positive events, both the experimental group and Control Group 1 were
significantly less optimistic than Control
Group 2 (p < .01), but they did not differ
from one another.
The negative event results provide support
for the proposition that people tend to use
an inaccurate image of others when making
comparative judgments. In the case of positive events, however, just asking subjects to
list the factors that influence their own
chances decreased their optimism, and providing information about others had no additional effect. This second finding suggests
that people's first thoughts about their future
may be more optimistic than their later, more
reflective conclusions. Further research is

needed to clarify these apparent differences
between positive and negative events.
The analyses of covariance found no significant group differences on posttreatment
events (Fs < 1). The experimental interventions were only able to reduce optimistic
biases temporarily.
The preceding analyses suggest that optimistic biases arise because people tend not to
think carefully about their own and others'
circumstances or because they lack significant
information about others. Yet there also appear to be more persistent sources of optimism, ones that cannot be eliminated just by
encouraging people to think more carefully
about their comparative judgments or by
providing them with information about others.
The treatment event data in Table 3 reveal
that the experimental manipulations reduced
but did not eliminate optimistic biases. Comparative judgments were still unrealistically
optimistic (p < .001) for both positive and
negative events. A detailed examination of
the judgments for negative events showed
that experimental group subjects gave fewer
strongly optimistic responses and more mildly

optimistic responses and responses of "average" than subjects in the control groups.
Exposure to others' reasons did not, however,
increase the frequency of pessimistic responses.
Relationships Between Reasons and Optimism
When the reasons listed by subjects were
examined (Columns 2 and 3 of Table 4),8 it
was found that favorable reasons—those increasing the likelihood of a positive event or
decreasing the likelihood of a negative eventoutnumbered unfavorable reasons. (Recall,
however, that this was not a random sample
of events. They were included in the comparative rating booklet expressly because they

8
Event 26, "not being able to have a child because
you're sterile," was not included in Table 4 because
a substantial number of the reasons listed did not
conform to the instructions (e.g., "I may never
marry," or "I don't want to have children"). None
of the conclusions about group differences in comparative judgments would be changed if Event 26 were
excluded from the statistical analysis of treatment
effects.

<-----Page 12----->818

had evoked unrealistic optimism in Study 1.)
The size of the / statistics in Column 4 demonstrates that the preponderance of favorable reasons was very consistent across
subjects.
Further calculations revealed that there was
greater excess of favorable reasons for the two
negative treatment events that had produced
the greatest optimism (Events 19 and 21)
than for the two negative events that evoked
the least optimism (Events 31 and 32), /(119)
= 8.71, p < .001. Similarly, the excess of
favorable reasons over unfavorable reasons
was greater for positive Event 2, which
elicited strong optimism, than for positive
Event 3, which evoked less optimism, /(119)
= 2.16, p < .05.
The last column in Table 4 shows that this
relationship between the kinds of reasons
listed and the degree of optimism persists
between subjects. When individual students
in Control Groups 1 and 2 made their comparative judgments, 9 the responses they gave
for each event correlated strongly with the
difference between the number of likelihoodincreasing and likelihood-decreasing reasons
they had listed for those events. The magnitudes of these correlations were the same
whether they were based only on Control
Group 1 subjects, who listed their reasons
before estimating their chances, or Control
Group 2 subjects, who listed their reasons
only after completing the comparative rating
booklet. This close correspondence between
the degree of optimism reported and the
number of favorable and unfavorable reasons
listed—both across events and between subjects within events—reinforces the suggestion
that the generation of similar mental lists
forms an important stage in the process of
deciding whether one's own chances differ
from average.
Relationship of Desirability to Optimism
Between Subjects
A final set of calculations looked for an
association between an individual's rating of
the desirability of an event and the degree
of optimism shown by that individual. Correlation coefficients based on data from Groups
2 and 3 between desirability ratings and opti-

mism were greater than zero for seven of the
eight positive events, but the coefficients were
quite small (median r = .14). For negative
events, the correlations tended to be negative
and small (13 negative, 5 positive, median
r = .13). That is, individual students who
regarded a negative event as particularly
undesirable were slightly more optimistic
about avoiding it than students who did not
think that the event was so undesirable,
a finding similar to that reported by Kirseht
et al. (1966). Thus, 20 of 26 correlation
coefficients were in the direction predicted by
a motivational interpretation of optimistic
biases (p < .01 by the binomial test).
General Discussion
In the past, unrealistic optimism about the
future was regarded as a defensive phenomenon, a distortion of reality motivated to reduce
anxiety (e.g., Kirseht et al., 1966; Lund,
1925). The present article has described several
ways in which purely cognitive errors might
be responsible for optimistic biases. Two
studies were carried out to test hypotheses
about the conditions under which unrealistic
optimism would appear, hypotheses derived
from both cognitive and motivational considerations. Although the results provide some
support for both points of view, the studies
were not designed to pit one against the
other, nor is there any reason why optimism
cannot have both cognitive and motivational
sources.
What these investigations have demonstrated is the existence of an optimistic bias
concerning many future life events. As predicted in Hypothesis 1, students tend to
believe that they are more likely than their
peers to experience positive events and less
likely to experience negative events. Cognitive
and motivational considerations led to the
identification of five event characteristics—
degree of desirability, perceived probability,
personal experience, perceived controllability,
and stereotype salience (Hypotheses 2-6)—

9
Data from subjects in the experimental group were
excluded from these calculations and from Column 1
of Table 4 because their comparative judgments had
been affected by the lists of others' reasons.

<-----Page 13----->UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM ABOUT FUTURE LIFE EVENTS

that were shown in Study 1 to determine the
amount of optimistic bias evoked by different
events. It was also demonstrated in Study 2
that providing information about the attributes and actions of others reduced the optimistic bias for negative events but did not
eliminate it.
The results suggest a mechanism that may
partly explain these optimistically biased expectations. In comparing their chances with
those of their classmates, it appears that
students brought to mind any personal actions,
plans, or attributes that might affect their
chances of experiencing the events. If an
event was one they perceived to be controllable and if they were commited to a
particular outcome, the majority of factors
they brought to mind were ones that increased the likelihood that it would turn out
the way they would like. Comparing themselves to an unrealistic stereotype of a person
who does nothing to improve his or her
chances or even engages in counterproductive
activity, students concluded that their own
prospects were better than average.
Yet there seems to be more to unrealistic
optimism than just an inappropriate comparison group or a possible bias in the recall
of relevant actions, plans, and attributes.
When experimental group subjects in Study 2
received the packet of event-influencing factors listed by other students, they should
have concluded that their chances were about
the same as those of their classmates. Their
classmates had listed the same types of
reasons and just as many optimistic reasons
as they had. Instead, subjects continued to
claim that they were more likely to experience positive events and less likely to
experience negative events. Unfortunately, we
do not know how they justified this conclusion.
Further research is obviously needed to test
the event characteristics and mechanisms proposed here, with other populations of subjects,
with a wider sample of events, and with other
methods of assessing optimism. Optimistic
biases may be much less prevalent among
older people, for example. Studies must also
examine the relationship between unrealistic
optimism and self-protective behavior. People
who believe, falsely, that their personal attributes exempt them from risk or that their

819

present actions reduce their risks below those
of other people may be inclined to engage in
risky behaviors and to ignore precautions. To
discover whether unrealistic optimism about the
future increases individual and societal vulnerability to disease, accidents, criminal victimization, and hazard loss is thus a central
goal for future research.
