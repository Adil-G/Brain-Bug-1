Abstract
The ‘‘framing eﬀect’’ is observed when the description of options in terms of gains (positive
frame) rather than losses (negative frame) elicits systematically diﬀerent choices. Few theories
explain the framing eﬀect by using cognitive information-processing principles. In this paper
we present an explanatory theory based on the cost–beneﬁt tradeoﬀs described in contingent
behavior. This theory proposes that individuals examining various alternatives try to determine how to make a good decision while expending minimal cognitive eﬀort. For this study,
we used brain activation functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate individuals that we asked to choose between one certain alternative and one risky alternative in
response to problems framed as gains or losses. Our results indicate that the cognitive eﬀort
required to select a sure gain was considerably lower than the cognitive eﬀort required to
choose a risky gain. Conversely, the cognitive eﬀort expended in choosing a sure loss was equal
to the cognitive eﬀort expended in choosing a risky loss. fMRI revealed that the cognitive
functions used by the decision makers in this study were localized in the prefrontal and
parietal cortices of the brain, a ﬁnding that suggests the involvement of working memory
and imagery in the selection process.

1. Introduction
The ‘‘framing eﬀect’’ is observed when a decision makerÕs risk tolerance (as implied by their choices) is dependent upon how a set of options is described. Speciﬁcally, peopleÕs choices when faced with consequentially identical decision
problems framed positively (in terms of gains) versus negatively (in terms of
losses) are often contradictory. The ‘‘Asian disease problem’’ described by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) is a classic example of the framing eﬀect. Decision
makers were asked to choose between a certain (i.e., sure) or a probabilistic
(i.e., risky) option to save lives (positive frame) or minimize deaths (negative
frame) from an unusual disease:
Imagine that the United States is preparing for an outbreak of an unusual Asian disease that is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease
have been proposed. Scientiﬁc estimates of the consequences of the programs are as
follows:
Positive frame:
If Program A is adopted, exactly 200 people will be saved.
If Program B is adopted, there is a 1 in 3 probability that all 600 people will be saved
and a 2 in 3 probability that no people will be saved.
Negative frame:
If Program C is adopted, exactly 400 people will die.
If Program D is adopted, there is a 1 in 3 probability that nobody will die and a 2 in 3
probability that all 600 will die.
Researchers who examine responses to problems of this sort generally ﬁnd that
negatively framed problems primarily elicit risky responses while positively framed
problems primarily elicit more sure (i.e., less risky) responses. After consideration
of the above example, most people chose options A and D, despite the fact that in
terms of consequences, these choices are contradictory (A is equivalent to C, as B
is to D). People appear to exhibit a general tendency to be risk seeking when confronted with negatively framed problems and risk averse when presented with positively framed problems.
In the past 30 years, hundreds of empirical studies 1 have been conducted to demonstrate and investigate the framing eﬀect in many diﬀerent contexts (Kuhberger,
1998). Similarly, many theories have been developed to explain human behavior

based on assessments of gains and losses (Kuhberger, 1997). Despite all this research,
cognitive theories designed to evaluate the processing demands and the kind of cognitive functions involved in the framing eﬀect are very scarce. In this paper we propose a cognitive model based on cognitive cost–beneﬁt tradeoﬀ theory (Payne,
Bettman, & Johnson, 1993). In the proposed model, costs and beneﬁts interplay with
cognitive and aﬀective processes. In addition, we test this model by using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique that helps us measure the cognitive
eﬀort involved in making a choice.
1.1. Background: Framing eﬀect theories
Multiple theories have been devised to explain the framing eﬀect (Kuhberger, 1998). These are broadly divided into formal, cognitive and motivational
theories.
Prospect Theory, the most well-known formal theory, explains the framing eﬀect
in terms of the value function for goods perceived as gains and losses from a reference point (Kahneman & Miller, 1986b; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Whether an
outcome is perceived as a gain or a loss depends upon the individualÕs reference
point, which is usually taken to the ‘‘status quo’’ asset level at the time of the choice.
The value function yields the preference value assigned to outcomes, and is concave
for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains. This functional
form implies that decision makers are more sensitive to losses than to gains and exhibit diminishing marginal sensitivity to both. Therefore, people will tend to opt for
a sure alternative perceived as a gain rather than for a risky alternative of equal expected value, while the converse will hold true for perceived losses.
Cognitive theories are designed to determine the cognitive processing involved in
weighting gains and losses. For example, the fuzzy-trace theory proposes that the
framing eﬀect is the result of superﬁcial and simpliﬁed processing of information
(Reyna & Brainerd, 1991). To evaluate this theory, researchers suggested and tested
mechanisms by which decision makers might simplify framing problems by reasoning in qualitative patterns rather than in probabilistic and numerical patterns. The
ﬁndings suggest that participants follow the path of greatest simplicity by using simpliﬁcation mechanisms to reduce cognitive demands.
More comprehensively, cognitive cost–beneﬁt tradeoﬀ theory deﬁnes choice as a
result of a compromise between the desire to make a correct decision and the desire
to minimize eﬀort (Payne et al., 1993). This theory holds that individuals initially
peruse the available alternatives to determine if they can make a good decision
and expend minimal cognitive eﬀort. They only commit to a more complicated cognitive eﬀort if they cannot fulﬁll their desire to arrive at a good decision by embracing a simpler alternative. Although this is an appealing explanation of the framing
eﬀect, this model ignores aﬀective processes that should play an important role in
determining what constitutes a good decision.
Motivational theories explain the framing eﬀect as a consequence of hedonic
forces, such as the fears and wishes of an individual (Lopes, 1987; Maule, 1995).
According to these models, decision makers assign stronger value to feelings of

<-----Page 3----->4

C. Gonzalez et al. / Journal of Economic Psychology 26 (2005) 1–20

displeasure than to feelings of pleasure, and this disparity increases proportionately
with the amount of gain or loss involved in a decision (Mellers, Schwartz, & Ritov,
1999). In other words, like Prospect TheoryÕs assumption that losses loom larger
than equivalent gains, motivational models are based on the claim that the emotions
evoked by the losses generally are greater than those evoked by gains.
We will present a theory which brings cognitive and aﬀective theories together.
This new model proposes an interplay of the cognitive cost–beneﬁt tradeoﬀ and
the motivational models to explain the choice process that leads to the framing eﬀect
and perhaps to other decisions under risk and uncertainty. The model is additionally
motivated by recent ﬁndings from neuroscience that may prove relevant to economics and decision making.
1.2. A cognitive–aﬀective tradeoﬀ model
We propose that the framing eﬀect occurs due to a tradeoﬀ between the cognitive
eﬀort required to calculate expected values of an alternative (if processing is costly,
people are less likely to choose the stimulus) and the aﬀective value of the alternative
(if the outcome produces a feeling of displeasure, people are less likely to choose the
stimulus).
In a positive frame, the compromise between arriving at a good decision and minimizing cognitive eﬀort is easy to achieve; for example, selecting the option in which
‘‘200 people will be saved’’ feels ‘‘correct’’ in an emotional sense and is eﬀortless (i.e.,
no calculations are necessary). If the decision maker expends the cognitive eﬀort required to analyze the more risky option, this alternative also will feel emotionally
correct and thus appear viable. In contrast, such compromises are more diﬃcult
to attain in the negative frame. Although the option in which ‘‘400 people will
die’’ is easy to analyze the relatively bad outcome makes it a less than ideal choice
(i.e., strong feeling of displeasure). Thus when selecting among options presented
in a negative frame, individuals are more willing to undertake the cognitive eﬀort demanded to assess the more risky option because they are more focused on improving
the outcome.
Payne et al. (1993) have published ﬁndings showing that individuals take longer to
make decisions when the options are framed as losses rather than gains. But does
that mean that cognitive eﬀort is greater in the negative than in the positive frame
or does that mean that the aﬀective cost is larger? And how would this cost vary
for diﬀerent risk levels? We propose that the costs and beneﬁts involved in this kind
of choices are of two types—cognitive and aﬀective—and that both play a role in the
framing eﬀect. On the one hand, the cognitive eﬀort involved in calculating an expected value is larger in risky than in certain choices and on the other hand, the aﬀective cost is higher for losses than gains.
Neuroscience can help disentangle these issues, as it is possible to measure the
amount and strength of processing involved in making choices. A better understanding of the physical mechanisms by which human decisions are made is of growing
interest for both economists and neuroscientists (Glimcher, 2003). fMRI studies suggest that cognition and emotion integrate in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain

<-----Page 4----->C. Gonzalez et al. / Journal of Economic Psychology 26 (2005) 1–20

when making simple choices (Gray, Braver, & Raichle, 2002). 2 Independently, the
PFC has been associated with both aﬀective processes and with the processing of risk
and uncertainty.
Damasio and colleagues have documented the role of the PFC in decision making
(Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2000). The most general conclusion from these
studies is that emotional defects produce impaired decision making and that a section of the PFC known as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (BA 11, 12, 13, and
25) is particularly important to decision making. Their methodology often involves
patients with lesions in the PFC as well as healthy participants (Bechara, Damasio,
Tranel, & Damasio, 1997).
The task used in their studies involves two decks of cards that produce negative
expected values in the long run but have extreme gains and losses and two other
decks of cards that produce positive expected values with less extreme outcomes.
The main ﬁnding is that PFC patients return rapidly to the less advantageous decks
after suﬀering a loss, although the immediate emotional reaction (measured by skin
conductance) to losses is the same as in normal subjects. They explain the results
with the somatic-marker hypothesis which poses that decision making is dependent
on emotional processes. As suggested by their results, damage in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex precludes the use of somatic signals necessary to guide decision
making in an advantageous direction (Bechara et al., 2000).
In addition to aﬀective processes, the PFC has been associated with processing
risk and uncertainty in decision making. Diﬀerent versions of a guessing task have
been used to examine risky decisions (Elliott, Rees, & Dolan, 1999; Paulus et al.,
2001; Rogers et al., 1999). For example, activity in the PFC increases during individualsÕ consideration of uncertain rather than certain conditions in two-choice prediction tasks that have no ‘‘correct’’ response (Elliott et al., 1999; Paulus et al., 2001;
Rogers et al., 1999). Conditions with uncertain outcomes elicit more activity in the
prefrontal and parietal cortices (BA 10, 7, and 40) than do those with assured outcomes (Paulus et al., 2001). Furthermore, the PFC has also been associated with differential activation in alternatives involving monetary rewards and penalties
(Delgado, Nystrom, Fissel, Noll, & Fiez, 2000; Elliott, Friston, & Dolan, 2000;
Knutson, Fong, Adams, Varner, & Hommer, 2001; OÕDoherty, Kringelbach, Rolls,
Hornak, & Andrews, 2001). PFC activity continues for a longer period of time after
a reward feedback than after a punishment feedback (Delgado et al., 2000). An
fMRI study of the Prospect Theory also addresses the anticipation and receipt of
monetary rewards and penalties (Breiter, Aharon, Kahneman, Dale, & Shizgal,
2001). When expectations of and responses to monetary gains and losses were
mapped to brain activity, higher PFC (BA 10) activity was found in response to
the size of the rewards or penalties than to whether they were gains or losses.
In summary, this research proposes a two-pronged explanation to describe the
posited connection between the PFC and the formulation of responses to positively

and negatively framed problems. First, the desire to arrive at a good decision can be
heavily charged with emotions in people attempting to do well and avoid bad outcomes. Second, the desire to minimize cognitive eﬀort can lead to activation in the
PFC as individuals determine the expected value of various alternatives. Thus we expect to observe an interaction between the activations associated with frame and risk
of the selected alternative. If cognitive and aﬀective processes interplay to produce
diﬀerent choices in positive and negative frames, we should be able to see diﬀerential
brain activity due to both the frame and the risk of the outcome. The negative frame
would produce more feelings of displeasure than the positive frame resulting in more
brain activity in the PFC; at the same time risky alternatives would be more cognitively diﬃcult due to the calculation of an expected value, producing higher PFC
activation than the certain choices.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Fifteen healthy, right-handed college student volunteers (5 females, 10 males)
gave signed, informed consent to participate on this study, which was approved
by the University of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Mellon Institutional Review
Boards. They were paid a standard amount of 30 dollars including training time in
the lab and time in the MRI scanner.
Participants were familiarized with the scanner, the fMRI procedure, and the risk
task by responding (while in the scanner) to four problems in the same format as the
ones they would receive during the study. The data for three participants were discarded due to the participantsÕ excessive head motion during testing. Additionally,
the data for two other participants who had zero responses to one of the conditions
were discarded.
2.2. Experimental design
Participants were asked to make 20 choices in response to 10 diﬀerent problems,
each of which was presented in both positive and negative frames. A meta-analysis of
previously published articles was used to select stimulus items that have been documented to clearly demonstrate the inﬂuence of framing on risky decision making
(Kuhberger, 1998). The problems were in the format of the well-known (and aforementioned) Asian disease problem, with two possible responses: one certain outcome
and one risky outcome. The positive and negative articulations of each problem were
presented randomly with one caveat: the two framings of each problem always were
separated by at least one other problem. The order of the certain and risky options
was counter-balanced within both framing conditions.
Choice trials were presented one at a time and were separated by rest periods to
allow for event-related analysis. Each trial began with the 10-s written presentation
of a problem portrayed on a display in the scanner. The two choice options then

<-----Page 6----->C. Gonzalez et al. / Journal of Economic Psychology 26 (2005) 1–20

7

were added to the display, and the cumulative display remained visible for 18 s. 3
Participants were instructed to make a decision and wait for the next screen to appear. Choices were entered by pushing one of the two buttons on a control box. Participants could enter their choices at any time during the 18-s response period. A
message indicating that time was about to expire was displayed 2 s before the choice
interval elapsed. Each trial was followed by a rest period of 12 s to allow the hemodynamic response to diminish. Five ﬁxation periods of 25 s were interspersed and distributed evenly throughout the acquisition to obtain a control base-line measure of
brain activation with which to compare the experimental conditions. During the rest
and ﬁxation periods, an ‘‘X’’ was displayed at approximately center screen.
2.3. MRI acquisition parameters
The study was conducted in a GE 3.0 Tesla scanner at the Magnetic Resonance
Research Center of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The fMRI data
for each participant were acquired in a single run consisting of 1030 images per volume. The run lasted approximately 18 min, during which the participant solved a
total of 20 problems, each presented for a total of 28 s, with a data sampling rate
of 1 Hz (TR = 1 s). Sixteen functional slice images were acquired in an oblique-axial
plane as shown in Fig. 1. The pitch angle of the images ranged from 15 to 28,
TR = 1000 ms, TE = 18 ms, ﬂip angle = 70, and a 3.125-mm · 3.125-mm · 5-mm
matrix voxel size with a 1-mm gap.
A 124-slice axial T1-weighted 3D Spoiled GRASS structural volume scan with
TR = 25 ms, TE = 4 ms, ﬂip angle = 40, FOV = 24 cm and a 256 · 192 matrix size,
was acquired for each participant after the functional data were acquired. This scan
was used in parcellating the functional images into anatomically predeﬁned regions
of interest (see below).
2.4. fMRI data analysis
Image preprocessing was performed to correct for in-plane head motion and signal drift using FIASCO (Eddy, Fitzgerald, Genovese, Mockus, & Noll, 1996; further
description of the tools available at www.stat.cmu.edu/~ﬁasco/). The fMRI data obtained during the ﬁrst 6 s after stimulus presentation were discarded to accommodate
the rise of the hemodynamic (BOLD) response to its peak level (Bandettini, Wong,
Hinks, Tokofsky, & Hyde, 1992).
To compare the volume of activation across the experimental conditions, a
priori regions of interest (ROIs) were deﬁned for each participant. The ROIs were
deﬁned using the parcellation method originally described by Rademacher, Galaburda, Kennedy, Filipek, and Caviness (1992) and subsequently reﬁned by Caviness, Kennedy, Bates, and Makris (1996). Because each individual cortical
anatomy is diﬀerent, the ROIs were drawn on the structural images of each

participant to precisely target the anatomical regions of interest (the surfaces of the
ROIs are shown in Fig. 1). The method has been consistently and successfully used
in many previous studies to compare the amount of activation in a given region
across conditions (e.g., Just et al., 2001; Newman, Just, & Carpenter, 2002). The
ROIs abbreviations as used in this study and their corresponding Talairach coordinates are listed in Table 1.
To investigate the patterns of activation according to the response variable, the
activation data was sorted with respect to both the frame and the response to form
four groups: positive–certain, positive–risky, negative–certain, and negative–risky.
The number of problems was equalized per subject to enable analysis of the same
number of images per condition. For each individual, the problems per condition
were chosen to match the number of problems in the individual with the minimum
number.
Activation was quantiﬁed for each of these four conditions using FIASCO. First,
a t map was constructed by computing the diﬀerence between each voxelÕs activation
in each condition and the base-line measure of activation (the ﬁxation period). Voxels whose signal change exceeded base-line by a t value >5.5 were considered active.
This threshold yielded an alpha-level of less than 0.02 after Bonferroni correction for
16,000 voxels in all regions of interest.
Once the number of activated voxels was calculated, the mean percent increase in
the amplitude of activation relative to the base line condition was calculated for
those voxels. These two values, the number of voxels and the change in activation
were used to calculate the dependent measure in this study (sum of signal intensity,
SSI). SSI was calculated by adding the percentage change in signal intensity for each
voxel activated in a particular condition and comparing this integral measure across

conditions. This measure, ﬁrst reported by Xiong, Rao, Gao, Woldor, and Fox
(1998), has since been used in many brain imaging articles. All statistical analyses involved within-subjects ANOVAs with both frame and risk as within-subjects
variables.
Although this study was particularly motivated to do analyses on the ROIs of the
PFC there is little information on the role of other cortical components on decision
making. Some studies suggest that the parietal cortex is also involved in processing
risk and uncertainty (Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001; Rogers et al., 1999). Thus, statistical analyses in all of the ROIs of the four lobes were
performed rather than only doing these on the ROIs of the PFC.

3. Results
3.1. Behavioral results
The distribution of choices over the positively and negatively framed problems
was consistent with framing results generated in previous studies. Participants chose
the certain option more often when responding to positively framed problems and
the risky option more often in response to negatively framed problems (Fig. 2, top
panel). The percentage of risk-seeking choices was 33% under positive framing
and 59% under negative framing (v2(1) = 13.6, p < 0.01). These results were obtained
despite the within-subject design of the study, which might be expected to encourage
consistency across responses to the same problem. Most behavioral studies employ

Fig. 2. Behavioral results: number of choices and reaction time. Top panel shows the mean number of
certain and risky choices in response to positively and negatively framed problems. Bottom panel shows the
reaction time for certain and risky choices in response to positively and negatively framed problems. Error
bars represent the standard error of the mean.

between-subject designs to eliminate the consistency problem (Levin, Gaeth, Schreiber, & Lauriola, 2002).
Behavioral studies often do not measure reaction time because such research tends
to focus on the outcomes rather than the processes involved in the framing eﬀect.
Our analyses of reaction time revealed that participants took more time to make a
choice in negatively framed problems than in positively framed problems
(11,227 ms versus 9990 ms, respectively; F(1, 9) = 17.5, p < 0.01; Fig. 2, bottom
panel), but took approximately the same amount of time across all frames regardless
of whether the participants selected the certain or the risky alternatives
(F(1, 9) = 1.19, n.s.). The interaction between frame and risk was not signiﬁcant
(F(1, 9) = 2.2, n.s.).
3.2. fMRI results
The main fMRI ﬁnding was that activation diﬀered between risky and certain
choices, but only for the positive and not for the negative frame. The selection of risky alternatives in positive framed problems led to higher activation in frontal, parietal and occipital areas than did the selection of certain alternatives. The level of
activation was very similar for risky and certain choices in the negative frames.
The eﬀect of diﬀerential activation did not seem to be due to the frame but rather,
to the risk of the alternatives chosen. Risky alternatives produced higher activation
than certain alternatives in particular in frontal and parietal areas.
For completeness, in Table 2, we present the activation and ANOVA results for
all of the ROIs, but the most salient entries in the table are presented in bold.
Comparisons of certain and risky choices in response to positively framed problems revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in several ROIs (right-most column in Table 2).
Higher activation levels were observed in positive–risky choices than in positive–certain choices. As shown in Table 2 this diﬀerence was signiﬁcant in the RDLPFC (BA
9, middle and BA 46) and RPOSTPRECEN (BA 8) regions. In the parietal cortex,
activation levels in participants making positive–risky choices were signiﬁcantly
higher in the LIPL (BA 40), right and left IPS (between BA 7 and 40), and RSPL
(BA 7) regions. We also observed signiﬁcantly higher activation levels in the right
and left IES (BA 19) regions of the occipital cortex when participants made positive–risky choices. Fig. 3 shows these diﬀerences between certain and risky choices
in a graph.
The same analyses indicated non-signiﬁcant diﬀerences in all ROIs (p < 0.05) for
negatively framed choices.
Fig. 4 depicts the average activation patterns. As indicated, selection of the risky
choices resulted in signiﬁcantly more activation in the frontal and parietal areas compared to the selection of certain choices. This diﬀerence is clear only in the positive
frame. The activation does not diﬀer between certain and risky choices in the negative frame.
In general, activation resulting from participantsÕ selection of risky versus certain choices varied in frontal and parietal areas. The selection of risky rather than
certain choices led to higher activation levels in the right dorsolateral prefrontal

cortex (RDLPFC; BA 9 (middle) and 46) and the left and right intraparietal sulcus (LIPS and RIPS, between BA 7 and BA 40) as shown in Table 2. Similar
analyses led to no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in response to the positive and negative
frames (p < 0.05). Fig. 5 graphs the diﬀerence in activation between risky and certain choices.
In addition to the activation described above that was measured during deliberation and choice process, we also measured the activation during the reading of the
problem (excluding the alternatives). The level of activity (measured with SSI) during
reading was much lower (about 85% lower), and almost always reliably lower
(p < 0.05) than during choice (see Appendix B).
4. Discussion
The behavioral results generated in this study show that participants preferred
sure gains to risky ones and risky losses to sure ones, a common empirical result.
Individuals also took more time to make decisions framed in terms of losses rather
than in terms of gains. The fMRI results demonstrate that the cognitive eﬀort involved in choosing a guaranteed gain is considerably lower than the cognitive eﬀort
involved in selecting a risky gain. In contrast, the cognitive eﬀort expended in
choosing a guaranteed loss is just as high as that expended in choosing a risky loss.

These ﬁndings support the cognitive–aﬀective tradeoﬀ model of the framing eﬀect
proposed in this paper.
The cognitive eﬀort involved in choosing sure or risky alternatives depends on
how the alternatives are framed (as gains or losses). fMRI results indicate that the
certain choice is considerably less costly (in terms of cognitive eﬀort) than the risky
one when individuals choose among options framed as gains. It seems that the tradeoﬀ between minimizing cognitive eﬀort and minimizing feelings of displeasure is easy
to resolve in the positive frame. Thus, individuals execute a decision quickly and opt
more often for the certain choice.
The diﬀerences between brain activity levels in response to positive–certain and
positive–risky circumstances were found to be signiﬁcant in several regions of the
frontal and parietal lobes, which suggests that cognitive processes such as working
memory and imagery were used more when selecting the risky option than when
selecting the certain option. Previous fMRI studies have found that the consideration
of large and unlikely rewards leads to more activity in the frontal and parietal cortices
of decision makers than does the consideration of small and likely rewards (Rogers
et al., 1999). Other studies have demonstrated that activity levels in the orbitofrontal
cortex of a problem solver increase with the complexity of the probabilistic demands
(Elliott et al., 1999) and the magnitude of the gains and losses under consideration
(OÕDoherty et al., 2001). Additionally, subcortical activity levels increase with the
amount of monetary rewards (Breiter et al., 2001). Because selection of the certain option required very little eﬀort overall to calculate expected value and much less eﬀort
than required to evaluate the risky option, participants chose the certain option more
often. In so doing, they likely were trying to avoid the cognitive cost involved in evaluating a gain and the emotions involved in imagining an uncertain reward.
In response to negatively framed problems, the tradeoﬀ between minimizing cognitive eﬀort and feelings of displeasure is diﬃcult to perform because both the certain
and the risky options involve costs. The risky option again requires the decision
maker to calculate its expected value and an emotional cost involved in the possibility of accepting a loss. However, selection of the certain option involves a higher
emotional cost by asking the decision maker to accept a guaranteed negative outcome. Decision makersÕ imagery may inﬂuence the emotional eﬀects they experience
due to expected outcomes. In particular, researchers have suggested that people are
more likely to imagine bad (rather than good) outcomes and how the outcomes
could have been improved (Kahneman & Miller, 1986a). Kosslyn et al. (1996) have
analyzed the emotional content of negative versus neutral pictures by evaluating
these picturesÕ eﬀects on neural activity. They observed an increase in visual cortex
activity in response to negative imagery relative to neutral imagery. Other studies
have used the imagery of diverse emotional situations to determine the magnitude
of physiological activity and activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Bechara et al., 2000). In addition, fMRI studies have shown that situations that conﬂict
with participantsÕ moral values result in higher frontal and parietal activation levels
(Greene et al., 2001). Thus, the conﬂict that results from selecting a sure alternative
that demands low cognitive eﬀort but leads to negative outcomes leads to increased
activity in frontal and parietal cortices. More speciﬁcally, as individuals imagine the

<-----Page 15----->16

C. Gonzalez et al. / Journal of Economic Psychology 26 (2005) 1–20

consequences of a guaranteed negative alternative they experience increased activity
in the parietal cortex, and as these individuals consider the conﬂict between their values and the consequences of the decision, they experience an emotional reaction evidenced by increased activity in the frontal cortex. Thus, the high emotional cost of
the negative–certain alternative and the high computational cost of the negative–risky alternative can explain our ﬁndings here of similar levels of activation irrespective
of participantsÕ choices in response to negatively framed problems. Since participants
chose the risky option more often than the certain option in response to such problems, our results suggest that people are more willing to accept a computational
rather than an emotional cost, despite the fact that both kinds of costs are similarly
demanding in terms of brain activity.
Findings reported in this paper are a good starting point to understand how cognitive and aﬀective processes integrate to determine our choices. Cognitive neuroscientists have aimed to determine how emotion and cognitive control are integrated
(Gray, 2001, 2004), and this study shows how both emotion a cognition play a role
in making risky choices.
There are however, many questions that arise from the results of this study. The
ﬁrst question relates to the particular localization of emotional and cognitive processes involved in making choices. Gray (2004) suggest that in fact attempting to identify parts of the brain that do specialized jobs might not help obtain a complete
understanding of how parts inﬂuence each other. Emotion and cognition ‘‘intertwine
so closely that at times it is impossible to discern which is doing what’’ (Gray, 2004,
p. 46). In this study, choices among positively framed options produced diﬀerent
activation levels depending on whether they were certain or risky, which we attribute
to cognitive eﬀort needed to calculate an expected value. The similar activation for
choices among negatively framed options is however attributed to two diﬀerent
causes, in the certain choice the feelings of displeasure and in the risky choice to
the cognitive eﬀort. The question is, can we disentangle these two ‘‘causes’’ of choice?
With the current state of art in cognitive neuroscience, it seems possible to target
particular regions of the PFC and subcortical components that may reﬂect emotional state and at the same time areas of PFC that may be specialized in cognitive
control.
A second, perhaps more diﬃcult question to answer refers to the interplay of these
two cognitive functions (emotion and cognition) over time. Targeting for the changes
of activation over time can perhaps help us understand how emotion and cognition
interact and integrate to produce behavior.

5. Conclusion
Hundreds of empirical studies have demonstrated the framing eﬀect in many different contexts (Kuhberger, 1997, 1998). Researchers performing these studies often
have treated cognition as a black box by focusing on the outcomes rather than on the
process by which decisions are made in these contexts. As a result, the subject of how
people fall prey to apparently irrational processes such as the framing eﬀect has gone

<-----Page 16----->C. Gonzalez et al. / Journal of Economic Psychology 26 (2005) 1–20

17

largely unaddressed. Our ﬁndings oﬀer an explanation based on the underlying
zneural processes involved in making choices in response to positively and negatively
framed problems. Activity in the frontal and parietal cortices suggests that working
memory and imagery mechanisms are involved diﬀerentially in choosing risky versus
sure options. Individuals considering potential gains display risk aversion that manifests itself as signiﬁcantly higher brain activity during the selection of risky versus
guaranteed responses. Individuals considering potential losses exhibit risk-seeking
behavior that manifests itself as comparably more brain activity regardless of the
selection of risky or certain prospects.

Appendix A. Brain regions and Brodmann areas
The cortex is divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital.

Within each of the regions there are more sub-divisions that are often associated
with diﬀerent cognitive functions. The anatomist Brodmann developed one of the regional classiﬁcation systems that is in use today based on the architectonic characteristics of the cells in various areas. Fig. 5 shows the Brodmann areas (BAs) in a
sagital and mid-sagital view of the brain. For example, BAs 9 and 46 correspond
to what is also known as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while the BAs
45 and 47 refer to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These areas often become activated in decision making tasks.
