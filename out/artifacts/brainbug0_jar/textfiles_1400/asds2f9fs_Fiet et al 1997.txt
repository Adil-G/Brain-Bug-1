INTRODUCTION
Why do new venture team members (NVTs) get fired by their financial backers?’ The most
obvious answer for executives of large firms, and the one for which there is the most empirical
support, is when the firm performs poorly (Fredrickson, Hambrick, and Baumrin 1988).
More seems to be involved, however, when venture capital firms (VCs) dismiss members
of a new ventures management team.2 Bruton, Fried, and Hisrich (1994) report that the four
most common reasons for dismissal” of managers by the VC were: (1) inability of managers
to make strategic decisions, (2) their inability to work with the board, (3) their inability to
motivate employees, and (4) their inability to adequately allocate resources. What is most
surprising from the Bruton et al. (1994) findings is that successors tended to have only a
marginally positive impact on subsequent new venture performance. Nor have other consistently reliable effects of dismissal been identified in the venture capital literature.
The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedents of dismissal. Because dismissals can sometimes be a costly and ineffective way to improve venture performance, it is in
a VC’s interest to know when to avoid funding ventures that are likely to be impacted by
future NVT dismissals. However, from an NVT’s perspective it is also essential that they
avoid making costly mistakes that could lead to their dismissal. If NVTs could recognize
signals that indicated their actions were viewed as being detrimental to the venture, this
recognition could enable them to take corrective actions and avoid being dismissed. Most
’ We refer collectively
to the top managers
of new ventures
as the new venture
team (NVT).
However,
we interpret
dismissal
as an event that terminates
any member
of the NVT. We also acknowledge
that many
VCs will not invest in start-up
deals, but prefer to invest in early-stage
ventures
that have already
demonstrated some success. Nevertheless,
for simplicity,
we retain the acronym,
NVT, and its referent,
to refer to
either new venture
teams or early stage venture
teams.
2 Venture
capital firms (VCs) are professionally
managed organizations
that often invest other peoples
money. Although
they frequently
syndicate
their investments
with other VCs, we assume that the interests
of the lead VC are essentially
the same as those of the other members
of the syndicate.
’ Dismissal
refers to a situation
in which the NVTs departure
is not part of a mandatory
policy and is
against its will (cf., Fredrickson,
Hambrick,
and Baumrin,
1988, p. 255).

importantly, if we understood the factors that were driving NVT dismissals, we could begin
to evaluate how dismissals might be used to create long-term value for a ventures backers.
However, because this is one of the first known attempts to examine dismissal in new ventures, it is our view that it is more prudent to begin to develop a theoretical framework within
which these issues can be viewed.
The literature on the replacement of top management team members suggests that dismissal can be viewed in at least three different ways. First, it can be viewed as an attempt
to constructively influence a possible conflict of interest between the NVT and its investors,
as represented in this study by its venture capital firm. This is an agency theory interpretation
that typically prescribes monitoring of the venture by its board of directors as a means of
ensuring that the NVT acts to maximize the venture’s value. Using the venture’s board to
monitor NVTs is an indispensable part of what VCs do after funding (Barney et al. 1994a.
1994b. 1996, in press; Busenitz et al. in press; Gorman and Sahlman 1989; MacMillan. Kulow,
and Khoylian 1989; Moesel et al. 1996).
Second, the power of a venture’s board of directors is moderated by its structure, which
constrains its capacity to initiate and affect dismissals. The resolution of conflicts among competing board coalitions is also constrained by the structure of the board. The influence of
structure on board-initiated changes among large firms has been investigated recently by
Goodstein, Gautam, and Boeker (1994). The present study extends their investigation to
the specific case of NVT dismissals among VC-backed firms.
Third, dismissals in new ventures can also be viewed from a procedural justice perspective. Sapienza and Korsgaard (1994) reported that VCs often become friends and close confidants of the managers of the firms in their portfolios. This approach emphasizes the importance of treating the NVT in a procedurally just manner to preserve their ongoing
relationships. Procedural justice does not foreclose the dismissal option, but it requires that
it be carried out fairly.
This study is based on the assumption that in real organizations these three perspectives
on dismissal are complementary. This has not been demonstrated to date by dismissal studies
in large organizations, and even less research has been conducted on dismissal in entrepreneurial firms. Bruton et al. (1994) described reasons for dismissal in VC-backed firms but
did not put them in a theoretical context. Consequently, we do not know if dismissal by VCs
in new ventures is the same as the dismissal of a member of the top management team in
an older, more established firm by its board of directors (cf., Cannela, Fredrickson, and Hambrick 1990). If it is different, how is it different? This study extends our empirical understanding of the phenomenon in VC-backed firms, but it also demonstrates the utility of viewing
it from complementary perspectives.

COMPLEMENTARY
ON DISMISSAL

THEORETICAL

PERSPECTIVES

We treat agency-related issues first, followed by those related to the power of a ventures
board of directors. We conclude by examining those related to procedural justice.

Agency Theory
In agency theory, conflicts of interest are possible in relationships when agents are hired
to utilize their best efforts to increase the financial rewards that accrue to principals. Such
a conflict could arise when a NVT (the agent) finds that its interests are different from those

<-----Page 3----->350

J.O. FIET ET AL.

of the VC (or principal). VCs pay very close attention to what NVTs do precisely because
their actions could pose a financial risk to the VC. NVT managers typically hold an equity
stake in their ventures, which creates an incentive for them to act more like principals than
agents. However, as long as managers only hold a partial stake in the venture, it is possible
that they could spend its resources on perquisites that would benefit themselves more than
the venture and its other owners or investors (Jensen and Meckling 1976).
Examples of inappropriate investments in the venture are purchasing an expensive car
and charging it to the business or siphoning off valuable skills and/or technologies to start
another business (cf., Amihud and Lev 1981). Because a venture manager would not have
to bear the entire cost of these expenditures, he or she could be more inclined to incur them.
The incentive to make inappropriate investments of a principals resources holds whether
an individual is an agent in the usual sense or whether he or she is a partial owner acting
as an agent for a group of owners. In either case, the same agency theory assumptions would
hold about the potential for conflicts of interest.
Agency theory also examines monitoring arrangements and systems of incentive alignment intended to equilibrate the interests of principals and agents (Alchian and Demsetz
1972; Fama and Jensen 1983; Jensen and Meckling 1976). Its primary objective is to suggest
how exchange partners may work together to minimize the sum of the costs of writing and
enforcing contracts.. . , the costs of monitoring and bonding activities, and the residual losses
incurred because it will not pay to enforce all contracts perfectly (Jensen 1994, p. 41). It is
a theory of symmetric exchange that emphasizes that even though the parties may have different interests, they also have incentives to reduce the costs of enforcing the exchange so
that savings can be shared by both principals and agents.
Agency theory suggests that the original structure of a deal can convey important information about joint expectations for the future and what will happen under specific alternative
scenarios. Using contracts as a signaling device works best when the signal is direct and difficult to misinterpret (Spence 1973). One way that VCs can signal their expectations under
alternative scenarios is with the use of contractual covenants at the time of first-round financing. Two frequently used covenants with potentially negative consequences for NVTs are:
(1) limits on the salary levels that can be paid to NVT managers and (2) conditions to force
a change in the composition of the NVT (Barney et al. in press), or for simplicity, dismissal
covenants. A third covenant with potentially more positive consequences for NVTs is an
earn-out arrangement that allows NVTs to become financially vested in the deal as they
successfully reach specific performance objectives.
The first covenant, limits on salary levels that can be paid to NVT members, may be
necessary because NVT managers may attempt to benefit personally from their association
with the venture, even if it does not succeed financially, by appropriating an excessively high
level of compensation for themselves. Unless the venture capital contract were to include
limits on managers salaries to forestall such self-interested behavior, as suggested by agency
theory, it is possible that it could succeed because all of the venture’s owners, not just the
individual manager, would have to bear the cost of the salary.
The second covenant, which is a dismissal covenant, specifies conditions that would
entitle the VC to force a change in management. Dismissal covenants are intended to prevent
NVT managers from engaging in actions that would be in conflict with the profit-maximizing
goals of the venture. These actions would be punished by dismissing the guilty team member.
According to agency theory, dismissal covenants are useful because they may serve to align
an NVTs motivations with the profit-maximizing aspirations of its VC investors.
We expect that both limits on managers salaries and dismissal covenants reinforce the

<-----Page 4----->COMPLEMENTARY

THEORETICAL

PERSPECTIVES

351

notion that the NVT ultimately reports to the VC-controlled board. Both of these covenants
provide disincentives for malfeasance. It may be that an NVT member could become a member of the team while secretly harboring a plan to misappropriate funds. However, the signaling provided by strict governance covenants could motivate a team member with devious
intentions to quit before being discovered and dismissed. Or team members who overstated
their qualifications for a job might decide to leave voluntarily before their true skill level
was detected. To the extent that this signaling can limit problems from agency, it would result
in fewer dismissals. This reasoning leads us to expect that dismissal will be negatively related
to both contractual limits on managerial salaries and conditions for forcing a change in the
ventures management. Formally stated, these two hypotheses are:
Hl: The presence of covenants to limit salaries paid to new venture team, members
will decrease the probability of their dismissal.
H2: The presence of covenants to potentially force a change in the new venture team

will decrease the probability of their dismissal.
Whereas both of these covenants provide disincentives for malfeasance, earn-out arrangements provide potential rewards for the achievement of performance objectives, which
would alleviate any need for a dismissal. Agency theory often utilizes strict penalties to discourage agents from pursuing their own self-interests at a principals expense. However, it
may be when financing a new venture that the opportunity to own an equity stake in it is a
much more attractive incentive, given the presumed up-side potential of these sorts of deals.
These arguments may be reduced to the following hypothesis:
H.3: The presence of earn-out arrangements for a new venture team will decrease

the probability of their dismissal.
Another deduction from agency theory is the importance of firm performance in predicting managerial dismissal. In fact, its role in dismissals among large firm CEOs has been
this literatures most consistent theme (Fredrickson, Hambrick, and Baumrin 1988). Controlling for environmental factors, agency theory suggests that poor performance will typically
be taken as a signal of incompetence or opportunism on the part of one or more of the members of the top management team (Fama and Jensen 1983: Fiet 1991). NVTs are interested
in how the performance of their ventures will be measured because of the reputation of VCs
for being active monitors who often prefer dismissal over other remedies. Moreover, the
ex ante performance representations of the NVTs together with the ex ante expectations
of the VCs are routinely reduced to enforceable contractual covenants. When the performance of the venture begins to lag. it is not surprising that the likelihood of NVT dismissals increases.
Agency theory predicts that managers have an incentive to demonstrate immediate evidence of sales improvement if they expect to retain their positions (Harrison and Fiet 1995;
Fama and Jensen 1983). Managers can increase sales by reducing profit margins. When sales
are increasing, this also represents a signal to VCs that the venture is moving in a more
profitable direction and lessens the need to make management changes or to immediately
reorient the venture toward a more viable market opportunity. Increased sales should satisfy
VCs in the short-run and should be negatively related to dismissals.
H#: Increased sales since first-round funding will decrease the probability of dis-

missal of one or more new venture team members.

Power Theory
We next examine two characteristics of the structure of a venture’s board of directors that
could influence its propensity to opt for dismissal as a remedy for underperformance.
Whereas the basic organizing principal underlying agency theory is efficiency, the effect of
a board’s structure on the dismissal decision is based on a power argument, which focuses
on the conditions under which VCs can realize the efficiencies they strive to achieve. We
define board power as its capacity to cause the NVT managers to do something that they
would not have done otherwise (cf., Dahl 19.57, pp. 201-215; Hill and Jones 1995, p. 410).
One way to maintain power is to maintain control by coordinating or centralizing access
to information.
We first examine the effects of board size on its power to dismiss a NVT member. Second, we examine the influence of board diversity on its power to dismiss a NVT member.
In the second case we will focus on the number of insiders versus outsiders on the board.
Each of these characteristics serves as a constraint that limits how VCs can realize the efficiencies they are seeking.

Board

Size

Larger boards usually increase the number and variety of perspectives that can be applied
to strategic decisions (Pearce and Zahra 1991). Rosenstein et al. (1989,1990,1993) examined
the contributions of board members to a venture and concluded that lead investor board
members contributed more than other board members, but only significantly more when
the lead investor was also one of the 20 leading VCs specializing in high technology firms.
In this section we examine the question of whether board size moderates the contribution
that can be made by any board member. We argue here that larger boards tend to be less
cohesive because each additional members perspective makes it more difficult to reach a
satisfying consensus (Shaw 1981; Goodstein, Gautam, and Boeker 1994). Lack of cohesion
may occur as each board member grapples for power to maintain control of its own interests.
Larger boards may be confronted with a number of obstacles to reaching a consensus
on a dismissal. They provide fewer opportunities to individuals for meaningful participation
(Jewel and Reitz 1981). Lack of opportunity for participation may alienate some board members, make them feel powerless, and even less willing to accept the decision of the majority
or to even make strategic decisions (Clendenin 1972; Mintzberg 1983).
As a board increases in size, individual board members feel more dependent upon others for their bases of power (Daft 1995; French and Raven 1959; Hinings et al. 1974). The
larger number of potential interactions increases the difficulty of coordinated action. As one
result of this coordination problem, larger boards are more likely to develop coalitions with
competing interests, which makes reaching a consensus more difficult (OReilly, Caldwell,
and Barnett et al. 1989; Goodstein, Gautam, and Boeker 1994). These arguments lead us
to our fourth hypothesis:
H5: New ventures with larger boards of directors will decrease the probability of

dismissal of the new venture team.

Board

Diversity

Many researchers extol board diversity because it may improve strategic decision-making
by airing more perspectives (Bacon and Brown 1975; Business Week 1987, 1989; Kosnik

<-----Page 6----->COMPLEMENTARY

THEORETICAL

PERSPECTIVES

353

1990, p. 135; McAlmon 1981). It may also reduce the probability of complacency and narrowmindedness (Kosnik 1990; Goodstein, Gautum, and Boeker 1994). Although diversity undoubtedly assures that more aspects of a management decision will be examined by the
board, at the same time it is likely to complicate and impede the boards power to take decisive
actions. Baysinger and Butler (1985) noted that board members cannot divorce themselves
from the interests of their constituents when they become board members. Those differences
may lead to the development of factions and coalitions within the board itself that have the
potential for conflict.
The most frequently cited type of diversity is the distinction between inside and outside
venture directors. Venture insiders are members of the new venture team who also serve
on the board of directors. Venture outsiders are often VC appointees who are not part of the
venture management team. VC appointees are likely to be more experienced in coordinating
their efforts than others on the board, particularly if they are also VCs themselves, as a result
of their reported tendency to co-invest with other venture capitalists (Bygrave 1988: Fiet
1995a). In contrast, those board members who are employed as officers in the venture. and
who probably had some voice in their own appointment to the board, are likely to be less
experienced in their roles on the board. These differences in experience could make decisive
action by the VC coalition easier because it would probably face less organized resistance
to decisions such as dismissal.
These differences become particularly important when board members are faced with
complex and ambiguous decisions such as dismissals. Suggestions that someone be fired can
increase uncertainty and intensify individual differences among board members (Mintzberg
1983). These differences can be further exacerbated under hypercompetitive conditions (cf.,
D’Aveni 1994). To the extent that a VC board was filled with outsiders who were VC appointees, this could enable them to band together to dismiss NVT members.’
H6: New ventures with a higher number of VC-controlled seats on their boards of
directors will increase the probability of dismissal of new venture team members.

Procedural

Justice Theory

Procedural justice theory holds that perceptions of exchange partner fairness are critical to
the continuity of these relationships. It is our view that understanding lingering perceptions
of the fairness of NVT dismissal among survivors is critical to our understanding of the event.
Procedural justice is defined here as the extent to which the dynamics of the VC-NVT relationship are judged to be fair by the entrepreneurs of VC-backed ventures. Procedural justice
theory suggests that because NVT members expect to be treated fairly by their VCs, the
power of VCs to make strategic changes is constrained. VCs can exercise power. but only
in a “fair” way.
Procedural justice theory uses the courtroom metaphor in which the actions of a third

party such as a judge or an arbitrator are evaluated for fairness by the litigants (Thibaut
and Walker 1975). Thus, two or more parties are perceived to be involved in a form of exchange with one party (e.g., the judge or arbitrator) who is granted reward distribution authority over the others (Lind et al. 1993). The effectiveness of the courtroom as a problemsolving institution is argued to be based more on the procedures used to determine reward
distribution (e.g., procedural justice) than on the degree to which the rewards are of equal
magnitude (e.g., distributive justice). Thus, a primary insight of the procedural justice approach is that the process by which outcomes are meted out can be more critical to exchange
partners than their actual distribution.
Translating procedural justice to the case of dyadic exchange suggests that preserving
an effective ongoing relationship requires that parties be able to maintain the perception
that their exchange partner is acting fairly in compensating them for any work or effort they
contribute (Greenberg 1987). An exchange partner may be able to retain his or her motivation to perform, even when an overt punishment has been received from the other party,
as long as the punishment is deemed to have been administered fairly. The primary way of
demonstrating that an overt punishment is fair, and not a cavalier act of power, is to show
the positive effects that the punishment is expected to have for both parties in the future.
From a procedural justice perspective, the dismissal of NVT members can be viewed as a
form of punishment that impacts future VC-NVT relations.
Sapienza and Korsgaard (1994) applied the procedural justice approach to the VCNVT relationship. They report the results of a simulation of VC investing that was designed
so that the justice judgment is made by the VC. They used graduate business student subjects
to simulate VCs with four prospective deals for possible investment. They found that their
student VCs invested primarily based on feedback received from the (computer-simulated)
entrepreneur rather than the degree to which the entrepreneur appeared to be influenced by
the VC. These VCs invested more, monitored less, and had more favorable attitudes toward
ventures when they received timely feedback.
We suspect that VCs realize that it is important for them to avoid causing venture managers to lose their enthusiasm for the venture, particularly as any need for a dismissal becomes apparent. One way that VCs could minimize a loss of enthusiasm after a dismissal
would be to carefully ensure that the NVT perceived that it was treated fairly. Ex ante, there
are at least three actions that VCs could take to ensure that they are perceived as having
treated dismissed managers fairly.
First, VCs concerned with a sense of fairness would not force their views of the business
upon the NVT. In arguing that they would not act dictatorially, we are not suggesting that
they are passive investors. VCs have a fiduciary responsibility to their limited partners to
positively influence the venture’s performance, as suggested by Jensen (1993). For example,
we know that venture capitalists are often very active participants in the activities and decisions of the firm (Fried and Hisrich 1992; Sapienza 1992; Rosenstein 1988). They typically
provide the firm with advice on operational and financial issues (Gorman and Sahlman 1989)
in addition to strategic and marketing issues (Barney et al. 1996, in press; Bygrave 1987).
A procedural justice perspective suggests that VC advice will not be forced on the NVT to
preserve the teams support and enthusiasm for the venture.
Second, VCs would be willing to compromise with the NVT when there were differences over the management of the venture. Compromise would be more likely to occur in the
face of hypercompetition where the speed of response to competitive threats is of paramount
importance (cf., D’Aveni 1994). Competitive threats would have the effect of bringing the
parties together to ensure their mutual survival. For high technology firms, VCs and NVTs

<-----Page 8----->COMPLEMENTARY

THEORETICAL

PERSPECTIVES

355

would attempt to reach compromise solutions so they could avoid being devastated by aggressive competitors as a result of responding too slowly while they debated their differences.
Third, VCs concerned with a sense of fairness would encourage the development of
new ideas by the NVT. Where impending dismissal was based upon concerns about venture
performance, a NVT’s ideas about potential product markets could contribute to eventually
salvaging the VCs investment in the venture. In such cases, members of the NVT who generated new ideas could be recognized by VCs as indispensable to the ventures future. New
ideas brought forth by likely NVT survivors also help VCs to develop the NVT into a cohesive working group after the dismissal occurs. Before the dismissal, the solicitation of ideas
from the NVTs is also an important means of validating the importance of survivors. Idea
solicitation would also facilitate the normalization of the exchange relationship.
In summary, when VCs demonstrate that they are willing to treat the NVT fairly, they
will be more effective in preserving the enthusiasm of NVT survivors after a VC-initiated
dismissal. There are at least three actions that VC can take to ensure that an NVT dismissal
is not viewed as strictly punitive, but intended to improve the future prospects of the venture

METHODS
Sample
Subjects for this research were those firms who had received at least one round of venture
capital funding. These venture firms were initially identified from the Venture Capital Journal. After screening out prospects with invalid addresses, we identified a sample of 837 firms.
Dillman’s (1978) total design method was utilized to construct the surveys and compile the
questions into a booklet format. After the initial mailing, a postcard reminder was sent one
week later and follow-up surveys were sent to nonrespondents three and six weeks after
the initial mailing, as suggested by Dillman. Replies were received from 235 firms: however,
30 of the responding firms did not qualify for this study because they had not recently received first-round financing, which is funding to initiate full-scale manufacturing and sales.
Most nonqualifiers had only received funding to execute a leveraged buyout. A few had only
received seed financing, which is funding for product development, market research, prototype development, and initial marketing. Because this study’s domain was the VC-NVT relationship at the time of first-round funding, these firms were excluded from further analysis.
This process resulted in replies from 205 firms, for a usable response rate of 24%. According
to SIC classifications, 83% of the respondents were from firms in “high tech” areas. The
average age of the venture firms was 4.9 years (SD = 4.45), and the average number of employees was 145 (SD = 394).
Given the risk inherent in these ventures, VCs often indicate a preference for syndicating their investments as a way of diversifying their risk (Bygrave 1987). The venture capitalist
who takes the lead in funding the deal and who generally invests the largest amount plays
the role of lead investor. The lead investor also has the principal fiduciary responsibility to
ensure that the NVT is acting in the best interests of all VC investors (Fiet 1995b).
Respondents in this study were funded by VC syndicates that were comprised of an
average of 3.1 VC firms. The average amount of their first-round funding was $3 million

(SD = 2.87). Their total average amount of capital under management was $121 million
(SD = 149).
All surveys were personally addressed to the president of the venture firm. The president was selected because we assumed that he or she would be the most qualified to respond
for all members of the NVT. In addition, we were more certain that a ventures top officer
would function as its president than we were about the corporate titles that would be used
by other team members.
The detailed and specific nature of the questions required that the respondent be very
familiar with the operation of the venture, including key issues that impacted decisions made
at the time of first-round funding. One section of the survey instrument solicited open-ended
comments from respondents. It was evident from these comments that the president of the
venture was actually the respondent. On a few occasions the chief financial officer supplied
the president with requested financial information.’
The dependent variable for this study was the dismissal of NVT members from the venture. Respondents were asked “How many employees in your firm have venture capitalists
played a major role in dismissing ?” Because dismissal is usually an event versus something
that occurs incrementally, we dichotomized this variable for analysis purposes. We found
121 instances of complete data for hypothesis testing. Of these observations, 43 reported
casesof dismissal (28 firms noted one dismissal, 12 noted two dismissals, and all other observations with three or more dismissals per firm occurred only once within our data set).

x5 = total number of seats on venture’s
board of directors,
x6 = VC-controlled seats on the venture’s
board of directors, and
x7 = procedural justice.
Regarding the contractual covenants in the above equation, respondents were asked
if limits on managerial salaries (xi) and conditions for forcing a change in management (x2)
were included as a part of the deal for first round venture capital financing. Respondents
were also asked if earn-out arrangements (x3) were included as a part of the first-round venture capital financing for their firm. Each of these was coded as 1 if it was in place at the
time of first-round funding, whereas all other responses were coded as 0. The change in sales
(xx) was computed by subtracting annual sales the year of first-round financing from the annual sales for the year after first-round financing. This difference was then divided by the
mean number of employees for these two years (several outliers were removed). This indicator measures the change in sales since the beginning of VC involvement with the venture.
For the board structure variables, respondents were asked two questions regarding their
board of directors. The first question addressed the size of the board: “After first-round financing, what was the total number of seats on your firms board of directors?” (x4). The
second question addressed the presence of venture capitalists on the board: “After hrstround financing, what was the total number of seats controlled by venture capitalists on your
firms board of directors?” (x5).
The procedural justice variable (x6) represented the NVTs perceptions of the fairness
of its treatment by its NVT, which we attempted to capture through the use of its three most
commonly identified dimensions: (1) formal characteristics, (2) explanation or information
offered, and (3) interpersonal treatment (Greenberg 1990; Gilliland 1993). The indicators
of these three dimensions were: (1) “Our VCs are willing to compromise with us” (representativeness), (2) “Our VCs have supported the development of new business ideas” (explanation or information offered) and (3) “Our VCs force us to accept their business views” [reverse coded] (interpersonal treatment). Respondents coded their answers on a S-point Likert
scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The responses to these three indicators were totaled and then divided by three to arrive at their mean values. The Cronbach
alpha for these three items was 0.71.
The probability that one or more members of the venture team with characteristics Xj
will be dismissed by its VC is shown as P[Dj=llX,]. Taking the natural logarithm of both
sides in (1) yields the linear relationship between the factors and the logit or log odds ratio:

We estimated the coefficients by maximizing the likelihood function:

[31

where N is the number of firms in the sample and Dj is whether or not one or more members
of the NVT have been dismissed. Maximization of equation (3) was accomplished utilizing
the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least squares method. The next section reports the results.

RESULTS
Table 1 reports the correlations, means, standard deviations, minimums, and maximums of
factors impacting the dismissal of NVT members. Table 2 reports the statistics for assessing
the fit of the model to the data as well as the parameter estimates from the logistic regressions
that estimated the probability of the occurrence of NVT dismissal. The chi-squared statistic
indicates that the analysis has produced a statistically significant model. Given the results in
Table 2, the null hypothesis of no contribution by this set of explanatory variables is rejected.
The coefficients in Table 2 are the log odds ratios of the factors contributing to the
dismissal phenomenon. However, if we want to know the relative contributions of each of
these factors (Xi) to dismissal, we must calculate their individual instantaneous rates of
change as follows:
aP[Dj = 11X)]

aXij

= P,P[Dj = lIX,](l

- P[Dj = lIXj])

[41

(Domencich and McFadden 1975, p. 84). The signs of the coefficients of these partial derivatives indicate the direction of the change of the impact of an explanatory variable, whereas
their magnitudes represent the impact on dismissal of a one unit change in the value of an
explanatory variable (Fomby, Hill, and Johnson 1984, p. 348). These partial derivatives are
found in Table 3.

DISCUSSION
This study provides support for the underlying proposition that the dismissal of NVT members can be understood more fully if we examine it from at least three perspectives: agency
theory, power theory, and procedural justice theory. The discussion of these theoretical results follows. Afterward, the discussion turns to the issue of what this research has contributed to our understanding of each perspective, followed by what we have learned about the
best way to handle dismissal in a new venture setting. This section concludes by discussing
directions for future research.

Agency Theory
Hypothesis 1 was supported. Contractual covenants limiting salaries paid to the venture
managers are related to fewer dismissals. They effectively signal that unsatisfactory performance may result in dismissal. This finding supports the view that clearly signaling the consequences of an undesirable behavior can reduce its incidence. So it may be that venture managers avoid dismissal by avoiding those actions that could lead to it. We may infer that early
signaling of severe financial consequences to those managers who fail to meet their performance goals is quite an effective mechanism for aligning their financial interests with the
VCs and those of the ventures board of directors.
Hypothesis 2 was not supported. Dismissal covenants to force a change in the NVT
are not related to dismissal. This result was quite unexpected, because they seemed to provide very clear and direct signals regarding the VC’s performance expectations and the possible consequences if they were not satisfied. It may be that individual venture managers understood that the threat of a dismissal covenant was real, although extreme from their point
of view, but that they preferred to believe that it would be used against other members of
the NVT, rather than against them. However, we learn that specifying the conditions that

will lead to a change in management is an ineffective mechanism for aligning the interests

of the board with those of the NVT.
Hypothesis 3 was not supported. The use of earn-out arrangements did not decrease
the incidence of NVT dismissals. This result suggests that some penalties (i.e., hypothesis
l’s limits on managers’ salaries) work better than rewards as an incentive alignment mechanism. It may be that NVTs are already sufficiently motivated to make the venture a success
without providing them with additional incentives. If they already possesssufficient motivation, this result may also suggest that many factors critical to the ventures successare outside

the control of NVT managers. Or it may suggest that the NVTs are not competent to manage
these factorsh
Hypothesis 4 was supported. It indicates a negative relationship between sales improvement per employee since first-round funding and dismissal. This result is consistent with studies of large firms-dismissal occurs when firms perform poorly. It is also consistent with Rosenstein et al.‘s (1989) findings among small firms that 39% of companies performing above
average had replaced their CEOs; in contrast, 74% of companies performing below average
had replaced their CEOs (p. 226). Investors are interested in the efficient (i.e., profitable)
operation of the firms in which they invest. If they do not achieve it, investors consider dismissing NVT members as a remedy.

Power Theory
For hypothesis 5, as predicted, increasing the total number of seats on the ventures board
of directors was found to be negatively related to the dismissal of members of the NVT.
This result is consistent with the power theory interpretation that larger boards lack cohesion
among board members who are charged with the fiduciary responsibility to take decisive
action when they believe it is necessary to improve venture performance.
Hypothesis 6 was also supported. That is, increasing the number of VC-controlled seats
on a venture’s board of directors was found to be positively related to the dismissal of members of the NVT. This finding suggests that individuals, even if they are self-interested, may
join together in a united effort to dismiss an ineffective NVT member. However, VC appointees tend to maximize their financial interests in a venture to the extent that they can
gain support for their proposals on the board, or alternatively, control of the board using
all their available bases of power. This result raises the question of when VC appointees
should borrow authority from their positions on the board to sanction and provide legitimacy
to their views and when they should cooperate with other board members so that the most
efficient decision solution can be reached. This research does not attempt to answer this
question. However, Rosenstein et al. (1993) found that the top venture capital firms tend
to structure boards with tight, outright control (p. 104), suggesting that they value the use
of power in influencing decisions made by the board.’

Procedural

Justice Theory

The seventh hypothesis predicted a negative relationship between procedural justice in the
VC-NVT relationship and NVT dismissal. It was also supported. Overall. procedural justice
had about the same effect on dismissal as salary limits, one of the agency-related antecedents.
Whereas salary limits send a no-nonsense signal, how can we explain a more procedurally
just approach resulting in approximately the same number of dismissals?
To explain the similar effects of the procedural justice and the agency-related antecedents, it is useful to remember that the procedural justice approach entails more than acting in

a certain perceived manner to resolve agency differences. It suggests VCs must be concerned
about preserving the capacity of the surviving NVT members to meet the ventures performance objectives. However, preserving the NVT’s productive capacity does not seem to foreclose the dismissal option.

Perspectives

This study provides support for the proposition that at least three approaches can be used
to enrich our understanding of dismissals in new ventures. Figure 1 summarizes the findings
from this study regarding these alternative explanations.

Theoretical

Extensions

of Dismissal

Research

Figure 1 illustrates that this study found some support for the agency theory prediction that
investors do dismiss members of an ineffective new venture management team. Two agencyrelated antecedents, salary limits and sales, received particularly strong support, but evidence for dismissal covenants and earn-out arrangements was inconclusive. However, there
is more to this dismissal story than merely the economic performance of the venture.
Although VCs may prefer to maximize the value of their holdings by using their power
to dismiss ineffective NVT members, they are constrained in doing so by at least two other
sets of factors. The first is the structure of the board of directors, particularly its size and
the number of VC-controlled seats. These structural features limit a VC’s power to overcome
resistance to dismissals from other members of the board.
The second is the apparent requirement for procedural justice, which is the need to
demonstrate that the dismissals were carried out fairly and were in the best interests of the
venture, the NVT survivors, and the VC. Otherwise, survivors could be less enthusiastic
about any success the venture might enjoy because they might fear that they would not be
employed long enough to enjoy it.
In summary, Figure 1 illustrates what this research adds to our understanding of NVT

dismissals. Poor performance is associated with NVT dismissals, as predicted by agency theory. However, the actual occurrence of dismissals seems to be moderated by the power of
the board of directors (i.e., as illustrated by the smaller the size of the board and the greater
the number of VC-controlled seats) and the necessity to act in a procedurally just manner
so NVT survivors will not feel threatened.
These complementary insights from three different perspectives are reminiscent of the
sometimes impatient discussion of the relative value of agency theory versus traditional management theory between Jay Barney (1990) and Lex Donaldson (1990a, 1990b) in which
the former cited Clay Alderfer. Professor Alderfer argued that many of the conflicts between
academic disciplines could be analyzed using models of intergroup conflict (Barney 1990,
pp. 389-390) According to Barney (1990), these debates often devolve into turf battles with
the combatants erecting intellectual barriers to entry presumably by influencing gatekeepers
who guard the most influential publication outlets. These turf wars, Barney (1990) argued,
inhibit intellectual inquiry and stifle debate, which ultimately eviscerates the most potentially
interesting and productive inquiry. It is our view that the findings of the present study provide
a hopeful indication that an interdisciplinary approach to research in the social sciences. and
particularly in entrepreneurship, can be both productive and informative. We attest to the
intellectual stimulation that it provided us during this study. It forced us to look beyond the
assumptions that generally govern venture capital research.

Lessons for VCs and New Venture

Managers

There are useful lessons in this research for VCs and new venture managers. First, the use
of explicit contractual covenants to signal the adverse consequences of underperformance
may not eliminate dismissals if the signals are misunderstood or disbelieved. Moreover, these
signals themselves could be costly investments with uncertain returns.
Second, before committing itself to fund a deal, a VC ought to consider how the structure of a board of directors will limit its ability to effect changes in the composition of the
management team. The larger the board, the more difficult it will be to make changes unless
VC appointees occupy most of the seats.
Third, dismissal may not be the best option if the venture’s successdepends upon the
specialized skills of its surviving managers These survivors could be very costly to replace
if they become disenchanted and quit as a result of a dismissal that was carried out arbitrarily.
Procedural justice theory suggests that dismissals must appear to be carried out fairly, which
could increase the short-term costs of changing the management team.
Fourth, focusing on reducing the number of NVT dismissals as a goal for VCs or alternatively using them to improve venture performance are objectives with uncertain benefits.
Sorting out these effects on performance is beyond the scope of this study.

Directions

for Future

Research

Understanding how NVT dismissal affects performance is vitally important and goes
beyond identifying dismissals antecedents. We need longitudinal data, stronger theory, and
carefully developed controls that rule out spurious influences on our interpretation. This
study has provided some evidence of the need to use multiple perspectives to identify possible endogenous and exogenous influences. It also provides researchers with more justification for being guided in the adoption of theoretical perspectives by their research questions,

<-----Page 17----->364

rather than by a particular perspective that may be momentarily popular. The findings from
this study also recommend the use of a wide screen, rather than a narrow one, to avoid biasing
the formulation of hypotheses.
The study of dismissal in new ventures offers great promise to those who study it among
larger firms, which frequently compete in multiple industries, in multiple businesses, and with
very complex and different sets of resource endowments. In contrast, research of dismissal in
new ventures offers the promise of a more controlled setting to study its antecedents
and effects.
Finally, in the future it is our view that the most productive inquiries in venture capital
and entrepreneurship will be theory driven rather than exploratory. Many promising frameworks exist for this purpose, among which are agency theory, transaction cost economics,
procedural justice theory, power theory, and recent perspectives from the decision-making
literature, among others. Whether considered as separate lenses, or when used in combination as in the present study, an intellectual feast awaits those who have the appetite for investigating it.
