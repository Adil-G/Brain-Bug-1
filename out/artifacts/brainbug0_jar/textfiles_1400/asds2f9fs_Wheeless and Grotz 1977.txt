THE MEASUREMENT OF TRUST AND ITS
RELATIONSHIP TO SELF-DISCLOSURE
LAWRENCE R . WHEELESS and JANIS GROTZ
West Virginia University
This study examined the relationship of trust to self-disclosure. A measure of individualized trust was developed and used in conjunction with a multidimensional measure of
disclosure to reassess the relationship between the two. A modest, linear relationship
between individualized trust and various dimensions of self-disclosure was discovered.
Moreover, a higher level of trust (as opposed to lesser trust as well as distrust) was found
to be associated with more consciously intended disclosure and a greater amount of
disclosure.

There appears to be a general consensus that a
relationship between trust and self-disclosure does
exist (Cozby, 1973; Pearce& Sharp, 1973). Despite
the fact that many investigators of self-disclosure
have argued that some relationship exists, little empirical research has confirmed this notion. While
some research could be interpreted as supporting the
notion that increased disclosive communication
produces trust (Deutsch, 1958; Loomis, 1959; Ostermeier, 196.7; Worthy, Gary & Kahn, 1969;
Wheeless, 1973), other research has produced ambiguous (Levin & Gergen, 1969) or nonsignificant
results (Johnson & Noonan, 1972; Gilbert, 1973).
The obverse relationship involving the effect of
trust on self-disclosure, the focus of this study, has
engendered even less research and validation.
Rather, researchers have most often argued that
trust is antecedent to a willingness to disclose. For
instance, Jourard (1971), one of the pioneer researchers in the area of self-disclosure, stated that
“a person will permit himself to be known when he
believes his audience is a man of goodwill. Selfdisclosure follows an attitude of love and trust” (5).
Indeed, the process of self-disclosure does impose
certain risks an individual must take such as becoming defenseless and unguarded, receiving negative
feedback, fear of exposure, or what Wenburg and
Wilmot (1973) termed the “reverse halo effect”
(the possibility that revealing one weakness about

the self will lead the disclosed-to person to generalize about other weaknesses the discloser might
have). Thus, it would appear that the discloser
should have positive perceptions of his target, including perceptions of trustworthiness, before he
takes such risks.
Some support for this line of reasoning does
exist. Mellinger (1956) found that “ a communicator, B, who lacks trust in the recipient of his
communication, A , tends to be motivated to conceal
his own attitudes about an issue, X, in communicating with A” (309). Honesty of disclosure appeared
to be affected. This suggests that a person will
inhibit his disclosures to someone whom he distrusts.
Pederson and Higbee (1969) found that trust was
significantly correlated with the amount of disclosures a male would make to his best female friend.
The lack of relationship found for both males and
females in relation to other target persons may have
been due to the nature of the measuring instrument:
the Target Person Rating Scale consisted of 1 1 bipolar adjectives which seemed on the face to tap personality characteristics of the target person rather
than perceptions of trustworthiness.
In a more recent study, Vondracek and Marshall
(l971), using Rotter’s Interpersonal Trust scale
(1967) and an original 144-item self-disclosure
questionnaire (based on items developed by Taylor

<-----Page 1----->TRUST AND SELF-DISCLOSURE

& Altman, 1966), were unable to find significant
correlations. Trust did not appear to be a significant
predictor of disclosure to “best friends” by the 56
males and females studied. Certainly, the nature of
disclosure targets as well as measurement problems
involving trust and self-disclosure are important and
potentially confounding elements in this and the
other studies above which have investigated this
relationship.

The logical and intuitively sensible reasoning underlying the foregoing studies has led, nevertheless,
to apparently inconsistent findings. However, these
discrepancies may be explained and perhaps resolved through more careful conceptualization and
measurement. First, interpersonal trust has been
conceptualized in the past as risky situations
(Deutsch, 1958, 1968; Giffin, 1967), dependent
behaviors (Bridges, 1970), and/or favorable perceptions (Hovland & Mandell, 1952; Hovland,
Janis & Kelley, 1953; McCroskey, 1966; Berlo,
Lemert & Mertz, 1969; McCroskey, Scott &
Young, 1971; McCroskey, Jensen & Valencia,
1973). Analogous aspects of trust have also been
independently derived and discussed more recently
by Pearce (1974) as “situations in which trust may
occur” (240), “trusting behaviors” (242), and
“the cognitive state of trust” (242). While it may be
important for measurement purposes to differentiate
these three concepts of trust, it may also be conceptually useful to integrate them into a meaningful
definition. Interpersonal trust is probably more
completely conceptualized as a process of holding
certain relevant, favorable perceptions of another
person which engender certain types of dependent
behaviors in a risky situation where the expected
outcomes that are dependent upon that other person(s) are not known with certainty. As a consequence, trust may be measured in research as certain perceptions, behaviors, or situations.
While conceptualization has pointed to rather
specific types of situations, behaviors, or perceptions, measurement has typically been much more
general in orientation. For example, the most
widely used instrument for measuring interpersonal
trust has been Rotter’s (1967) Interpersonal Trust
Scale. This scale consists of 25 Likert-type, self-

251

report items designed to measure a person’s generalized expectancy that the promises of other individuals or groups with regard to future behavior can be
relied upon. In brief, the scales measure trust in
other people in general (generalized trust) rather
than trust in specific individuals. Several investigations have provided evidence for the scale’s validity
(Geller, 1966; Rotter, 1967; Hamsher, Geller &
Rotter, 1968). However, Vondracek and Marshall’s (1971) study predicted that persons scoring
high on self-disclosure would also score high on
interpersonal trust (using Rotter’s scale), and failed
to find a significant relationship. Other studies attempting to examine generalized trust that have not
utilized Rotter’s scale have typically used one or
two self-report items.
In order to examine the relationship between interpersonal trust and self-disclosure with self-report
techniques, measurement that taps the degree of
perceived trust in specific individuals is needed. As
Vondracek and Marshall (1971) have pointed out,
“if disclosure is measured with reference to a particular target person, trust should also be measured
as it relates to that target person. If this is right,
further exploration of this relationship must await
the appearance of a good measure of individualized
trust. . .” (239). Giffin (1967), of course, insightfully suggested utilization of credibility scales as a
measure of perceived trust in an individual person.
Unfortunately, he failed to suggest utilization of
only those scales tapping perceptions of trustworthiness as opposed to those tapping extroversion,
sociability, etc. The possibility of developing a
self-report based upon perceptions of individualized
trustworthiness, however, appears to be quite good.
Similar possibilities have already been found in
regard to self-disclosure, our second area of concern. Based upon Cozby’s (1973) definition, selfdisclosure has recently been reconceptualized in the
following manner: “ A self-disclosure is any message about the self that a person communicates to
another. Consequently, any message or message
unit may potentially vary in the degree of selfdisclosure present depending upon the perceptions
of the message by those involved [in the transaction]” (Wheeless & Grotz, 1975, 1976). Moreover,

<-----Page 2----->252

Wheeless and Grotz

self-disclosure has also been conceptualized as multidimensional (Altman & Taylor, 1973; Cozby,
1973; Wheeless & Grotz, 1975, 1976). Based upon
this notion, recent research has discovered at least
five dimensions of reported self-disclosure and has
developed a preliminary measuring instrument
(Wheeless & Grotz, 1976). Dimensions related to
(1) consciously intended disclosure, (2) amount of
disclosure, (3) positive-negative nature of the disclosure, (4)honesty-accuracy of the disclosure, and
( 5 ) control of the depth or intimacy of the disclosure
were found as a result of the related conceptualization and subsequent research.
Unfortunately, research which investigated the
relationship between trust and disclosure typically
measured only one aspect of self-disclosure. In
some instances self-disclosure was measured
categorically without allowing meaningful variations in degrees of disclosure even on one dimension. Clearly, the impact of trust may have been
related to a number of dimensions of self-disclosure
which were not measured. However, a more comprehensive assessment of varying disclosure on a
number of dimensions could facilitate the discovery
of meaningful linkages between the two constructs.
FOCUS, RATIONALE, AND HYPOTHESES
According to the foregoing analysis, it appeared
that the relationship of trust to self-disclosure had
not been adequately tested. Rather, inappropriate
measurement resulting from inadequate conceptualization appeared to have produced inconclusive
and seemingly inconsistent results. While recent
developments in self-disclosure measurement appear to offer potential solutions to help resolve this
problem, the measurement of individualized trust
remains problematic. Therefore, a major focus of
this study was to develop a measure of individualized trust in specific target-persons. To assess
the nature of this new measurement, a comparison
with generalized trust was thought to be desirable.
Therefore, the following research question was in-

vestigated: What is the nature of and relationships
between individualized and generalized trust?
Based upon this attempt at developing individualized trust measurement and more complete assessment of self-disclosure, re-examination of the
trusdself-disclosure relationship was undertaken.
Although, the relationship of trust to self-disclosure
had not been adequately tested, the rationale underlying this linkage still appeared to be reasonable.
The idea that a person is unlikely to disclose to
another whom he distrusts appeared to be almost
axiomatic. More precisely, one does not normally
self-disclose to another whom he sufficiently distrusts. Rather, trust and self-disclosure appear to be
related in such a way that trust in a specific individual is a necessary condition for self-disclosure to
that person. However, modest extension of this
rationale appears to be necessary because individuals may trust some people to whom they do not
self-disclose. Trust in another is a necessary but
insufficient condition to guarantee self-disclosure.
However, when suficient individual trust for disclosure is present, then even higher levels of trust
increase the probability of more self-disclosure.
While this relationship between trust and disclosure
does not appear to be completely linear, a moderate
relationship between the two could be expected.
Therefore, the following hypotheses were tested:

1. Perceived trustworthiness of specific disclosure
target-persons is positively related to selfdisclosure to the specific disclosure targets.
2 . Persons with higher levels of trust in a target
person report higher disclosure levels to that
target than persons with lower levels of trust in a
target.
Lower levels of trust, included trusted targets as
well as those distrusted. Higher levels of trust included more highly trusted targets. Sex of the discloser, which appear to be a potentially confounding variable (Cozby, 1973), was used as a
control. Generalized trust (Rotter, 1967) was included in the analysis of the first hypothesis for

<-----Page 3----->TRUST AND SELF-DISCLOSURE

purposes of comparison with individualized trust
and exploration of the research question.
METHOD
Sample and Procedures

A sample of 261 Ss was selected for this study.
In order to increase sample diversity, 100 teachers
in the state who were enrolled in an introductory
graduate extension course on communication in the
classroom and their spouses or oldest child were
selected for the sample. The remainder of the sample was selected from lower division courses in
human communication at the university. All Ss
were randomly assigned to disclosure targets and
treatment conditions according to the procedure outlined below. Sample diversity and randomization
procedures were thought to increase generalizability of results.
The study was concerned with generating an instrument capable of assessing individualized trust
and testing the two hypotheses related to the effect
of trust on reported self-disclosure. Ss were administered a booklet containing a 15-item measure
of generalized trust, a 15-item measure of trust in a
specific target person, and a 16-item instrument
designed to measure dimensions of self-reported
self-disclosure to the previously specified target
person. Ss were randomly assigned to one of 20
trust-disclosure targets.
The study was administered under the guise of an
attempt “to develop some resources (scales, messages, sources, etc.) for future research.” Although
information was requested in terms of age, sex, and
marital status, Ss were not asked to identify themselves. Rather, they were told that the researchers
wanted to know how “people in general responded” in order to assess the value of the materials. Consequently, only 12 Ss failed to respond
sufficiently to be included in the analysis of the
instruments assessing the two types of trust
(N=249), whereas 39 Ss failed to respond completely enough across all measures to be included in
hypothesis testing (N= 222).

Measuring Instruments
Trust of people in general (Generalized Trust)
was measured by 15 items selected from Rotter’s
(1967) interpersonal trust scales. These selected
scales were converted from 5-interval to 7-interval,
Likert-type responses. Trust of specific target persons (perceived target trustworthiness) was measured with 15 semantic differential-type items derived from Berlo, Lemert, and Mertz’s (1969)
safety-trustworthiness factor and from McCroskey’s (1971, 1973) character factor of perceived
interpersonal credibility. These items selected, plus
additional items generated by the researchers, were
included on the basis of their face validity for
measuring perceived trustworthiness as conceptualized in the initial section of this paper (see Table
1 for resulting scales). Also, 16 Likert-type statements consisting of 7-interval responses were used
in an attempt to measure self-reported selfdisclosure (Wheeless & Grotz, 1975, 1976) on the
dimensions of amount, honesty-accuracy, consciously intended disclosure, positive-negative disclosure, and control of general depth or intimacy of
disclosure .’
Statistical Analysis
Principal components factor analysis with orthogonal rotation was used to investigate the predicted unidimensionality of the two measuring instruments. The scree procedure recommended by
Cattel and the establishment of an eigenvalue of 1.O
as an initial cut-off criterion were used to determine
the number of factors present. Each factor was required to have at least two items loaded at .60 or
above with no secondary loadings at .40 or above.
Items were accepted as loaded on an additional
extracted factor if they met the .60 - .40 criterion.
Pearson product-moment correlations were used to
assess the magnitude of relationships among different tests as well as to facilitate estimates of reliability. Predictive validity was assessed in terms of tests
of predicted effects and relationships.

Canonical correlation of individualized and generalized trust with the self-disclosure dimensions
was used to test the first hypothesis predicting relationships between individualized trust and selfdisclosure. Generalized trust was included as a control variable for comparison purposes. Analyses of
variance and directional t-tests were used to test the
differences on reported disclosure dimensions as a
function of individualized trust. Sex of discloser
was used as a control to check for interaction effects. The .05 level of significance was required on
statistical tests of the hypotheses.
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION

Measurement and Probes of General Research
Question

The 15-item, perceived trustworthiness (individualized trust) instrument was submitted to factor

analysis with orthogonal rotation. Application of a
priori criteria (scree and 1.0 eigenvalue) revealed
that the instrument measured a unidimensional,
single factor of trust in another accounting for 59%
of the total variance with items having fairly high
factor loadings (see Table 1). Split-half reliability
was .92 (df-247). For the 20 target persons used in
this study, individualized trust displayed the following norms: mean = 8 1, standard deviation = 19,
range = 23-105. The potential range was 15-105
and the neutral score between distrust and trust was
60 (scale midpoint).
Rotter’s (1967) interpersonal trust scales (15
items), used as a measure of generalized trust, were
also submitted to factor analysis. The rotation revealed a two-factor structure. However, examination of the items loaded revealed that the positively
worded items constituted the first factor and the
negatively worded items were loaded on the second
factor. Therefore, Rotter’s instrument was regarded
as unidirnensional. Since factor loadings on a single

<-----Page 5----->TRUST AND SELF-DISCLOSURE

factor are not meaningful in this situation, they are
not reported. In this study, the split-half reliability
was .61.
The correlation between individualized trust
(trustworthiness) and generalized trust (Rotter) was
not significant (r= .02; df=247). Apparently, individualized trust and generalized trust were (and can
be) measured fairly reliably as independent constructs by the use of the two instruments used in this
study. However, each individual was exposed to
only one target person although 20 targets were
used. An individual’s “average individualized
trust” in a large number of targets might well be
related to his generalized trust of people. Therefore,
we should not assume that generalized trust and
individualized trust are totally independent. However, the two constructs can be relatively uncorrelated when only a limited number of targets are
assessed by individuals for individualized trustworthiness as was the case in this study.
Relationship of Trust to Self-Disclosure

The first hypothesis, predicting a positive relationship between individualized trust and selfdisclosure, was analyzed with canonical correlation. Individualized trust (perceived trustworthiness
of a target person) and general trust (control) scores
were correlated with scores of reported selfdisclosure to the target on five dimensions.
A significant canonical correlation was observed
between trust measures and the five-factor selfdisclosure measures (r=.26; X2= 19.75; df= 10).
The canonical variable of trust was significantly
correlated with both individualized trust in a target
person (r= .99) and generalized trust (r=. 14). The
canonical variable related to disclosure was significantly correlated with all five dimensions of selfdisclosure: Intent ( r = . 5 5 ) , Amount (r= .37),
Positive-Negative (r= .35), Honesty-Accuracy
(r= .39), and Control of general depth of disclosure
(r= .7 1). Target trust was the main contributor to the
correlation with self-disclosure dimensions consisting predominantly of control of general depth and
consciously intended disclosure. Although generalized trust was the main contributor (r= .99) to the

255

next canonical correlation extracted, the correlation
was not significant.
Apparently trust is predominantly related to control of depth and intent to disclose. Individualized
trust appears almost exclusively to be the type of
trust related. The strength of that linear relationship,
however, appears to be modest with only seven
percent of shared variance observed between the
two constructs. Although the hypothesis received
significant support, the actual linear relationship
between trust and disclosure may not be too meaningful. As argued in the rationale, it may well be
that some sufficient level of trust for the individual
is merely a prerequisite for disclosure. This level
may vary from individual to individual. Also, while
a sufficient level of target trust may be prerequisite,
it may not guarantee disclosure; rather, we may not
disclose to a number of trusted targets. Given individuals with predispositions to disclose, however,
sufficient trust in the target might be a fairly good
predictor of increased disclosure. Such was indicated in the test of the second hypothesis.
The second hypothesis, predicting that persons
with higher individualized trust report higher selfdisclosure to that target than persons with lower
individualized trust, was analyzed with analyses of
variance on each self-disclosure dimension to acquire error terms and to control for sex-of-discloser
interaction (higher and lower trust by male and
female discloser). Higher individualized trust was
operationalized as above the mean, 81; lower trust,
as at the mean and below. The neutral score between
trust and distrust was .60. Predicted cell comparisons were made with one-tailed t-tests. (Since the
dependent variables-dimensions of disclosurewere not meaningfully correlated, MANOVA was
not a more efficient or appropriate procedure.) No
significant interaction of individualized trust with
sex was observed on any of the dependent variables
measuring self-disclosure. A significant difference
in consciously intending to disclose to the target
(t=2.09; df=220) was observed. Consciously intended self-disclosure was higher (M= 14.82) for
persons higher in individualized trust of the target
than was such disclosure (M= 13.80) for those
lower in individualized target trust. Likewise, a

<-----Page 6----->256

Wheeless and Grotz

significant difference in amount of disclosure,
(t=2.09; df=220) was also observed. Amount of
disclosure was greater (M= 16.50) for those higher
in individualized trust than the amount of disclosure
(M= 15.29) for those lower in individualized trust.
No other significant differences in self-disclosure
dimensions were observed to be related to higher
levels of individualized trust.
While the positive linear relationships between
individualized trust scores and disclosure scores
were not discovered as highly meaningful, broader
categories involving higher and lower levels of individualized trust in a target did appear to be related
to levels of consciously intended disclosure and
amounts of disclosure. Apparently, also, it is not
necessary to distrust another for disclosure levels to
be lower: target trust was categorized above and
below the mean (81) which was substantially above
the absolute neutral score (60) on trust. Rather,
lower levels of trust (not distrust) are related to
lower disclosure on intent and amount dimensions.
More discrepant categories of higher and lower
target trust might well relate to more discrepant
disclosure levels. For example, if a sufficient sample size permitted comparing those persons reporting trust scores beyond standard deviations above
and below the mean then more dramatic differences
in disclosure might well be discovered-especially
for those categorized as distrustful disclosure
targets.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
This study assessed the nature and measurement
of trust. In this process a reliable 15-item semantic
differential-type instrument was developed for
measuring trust in other specified individuals (individualized trust). The instrument had predictive validity in the sense that levels of self-disclosure on a
number of dimensions were related to individualized trust scores derived from the new scales.
Similar reliability and validity were not found for
selected scales measuring generalized trust (Rotter,
1967). Also, the two constructs were not found to be
related to each other within the limitations of this
study. Therefore, the individualized ,trust scales
(ITS) are recommended for general use as an alternate means of measuring trust.

Although generalized trust of people was not
found to be related to self-disclosure on any dimension, trust in specific targets was. Higher individualized trust in disclosure targets (as opposed to
lesser trust) is related to more consciously intended
disclosure and greater amounts of disclosure. This
conclusion also implies that distrust is not a necessary condition for lowering disclosure levels;
rather, merely lesser trust. While a positive, linear
relationship between individualized trust and disclosure on various dimensions was discovered, the
strength of that relationship was not high. This
conclusion implies that sufficient levels of trust may
be prerequisite to disclosure but not a guarantee of
it. These general conclusions, of course, generally
support the paradigm generated for this study.
Moreover, other elements such as presence or absence of general disclosive predispositions may
function to confound the relationship of individualized trust to self-disclosure. This consideration
plus more focus in the future upon individualized
trust as well as distrust might well lead to fruitful
discoveries in this area of research.
NOTES
1. The 20 targets specified, in an attempt to maximize

variability for those considered “close” and “more
distant,” were the following: mother, father, brother/
sister, spouse, gidboyfriend, best male friend, best
female friend, doctor, ministedpriest, psychologist/
guidance counselor, barbedhairdresser, neighbor,
instructor/professor, roommate, classmember, coworker, disliked male, disliked female, subordinate/
employee, boss/superior. If a subject did not know
such a target as he was assigned to, then he exchanged
booklets with another subject or was given the next
booklet containing a different target.
2. The disclosure scales for each dimension and the reliability found for each dimension are available from
the first author on request.
