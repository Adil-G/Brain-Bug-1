Choosing versus rejecting: Why some options
are both better and worse than others
ELDAR SHAFIR
Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey

A previously unobserved pattern of choice behavior is predicted and corroborated. In line with
the principle of compatibility, according to which the weighting of inputs is enhanced by their
compatibility with output, the positive and negative dimensions of options (their pros and cons)
are expected to loom larger when one is choosing and when one is rejecting, respectively. Subjects are presented with pairs of options, one of which—the enriched option—has more positive
as well as more negative dimensions than does the other, impoverished, option. Because positive
dimensions are weighted more heavily in choosing than in rejecting, and negative dimensions
are weighted more heavily in rejectingthan in choosing, the enriched option tends to be chosen
and rejected relatively more often than the impoverished option. These findings are extended
to nonbinary decision problems, and their implications for the rational theory of choice and for
everyday decisions are discussed.
Decision theory is concerned with the behavior of people who are faced with the problem of choosing among
options. Choices are commonly assumed to reflect underlying preferences, which are expected to satisfy a number of basic conditions. Most importantly, the classical
theory of preference assumes that each individual has a
well-defined preference order (or a utility function) over
any set of options. Each option has some personal value,
or utility, for the decision maker, a well-established position in his/her preference ordering: If the person prefers
option X over option Y, he/she should not also prefer option Y over option X (von Neumann & Morgenstern,
1947). In addition, if an individual has clear and stable
preferences, these should be invariant across normatively
equivalent methods of assessing preference and across logically equivalent ways of describing the options.
Recent studies of decision making indicate that the foregoing assumptions do not always hold, because people
tend not to have well-defined values and preferences.
Making decisions is often hard, because we do not know
how to trade off one attribute (e.g., salary) against another
(e.g., leisure), how to predict the pleasure or pain of future consequences, or, for that matter, what exactly matters to us most (Goldstein, 1990; Kahneman & Snell,
1990; March, 1978; Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein,
1982). Hence, we often arrive at a decision problem not
with well-established and clearly ranked preferences, but
rather with the need to determine our preferences as a
result of having to decide. Preferences, it turns out, are

actually constructed—not merely revealed—during their
elicitation. And the construction of preferences appears
to be sensitive to various aspects of the decision problem. Work on framing (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986) and
on methods of elicitation (Payne, 1982; Tversky, Sattath,
& Slovic, 1988) has shown preferences to be remarkably
sensitive to the ways in which options are described (e.g.,
in terms of gains or losses) and to the methods through
which preferences are elicited (e.g., through judgment or
choice). Decisions are often reached by focusing on considerations that justify the selection of one option over
others (Simonson, 1989; Slovic, 1990; Tversky & Shafir,
1992; see Shafir, Simonson, & Tversky, in press, for discussion). Different frames, contexts, and elicitation procedures highlight different aspects of the options and bring
forth different considerations, which often give rise to inconsistent decisions.
A general mechanism underlying the construction of
preferences is captured by the compatibility principle. According to this principle, some tasks are easier to perform
than others and some stimulus components are more salient than others because of the particular sets of stimuli
and responses that are being used, and because of the ways
in which these stimuli and responses interact with each
other. The significance of the compatibility between input
and output has long been recognized by students of human perceptual and motor performance. In their investigations of stimulus-response compatibility, these researchers have observed, for example, that responses to visual
displays of information, such as an instrument panel, will
be faster and more accurate if the response structure is
compatible with the arrangement of the stimuli (Fitts &
Seeger, 1953; Wickens, 1984). Thus, a square array of
four burners on a stove is easier to control with a corresponding square array of knobs rather than a linear array. Similarly, the response to a pair of lights is faster

546

<-----Page 1----->CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
and more accurate if the left light is assigned to the left
key and the right light to the right key. Beyond spatial
organization, stimulus-response compatibility has been
evoked, for example, to account for the fact that a pointing response is faster than a vocal response when the stimulus is visual, whereas a vocal response is faster than
pointing when the stimulus is auditory (Brainard, Irby,
Fins, & Alluisi, 1962). The rationale for such effects is
that a translation stage intervenes between the presentation of stimuli and the selection of responses: the greater
the compatibility between stimuli and responses, the less
the time that is required and the lower the likelihood of
error. Compatibility between stimulus and response ensembles has been proposed to account for results obtained
in a wide variety of performance tasks (see, e.g., Kornblum, Hasbroucq, & Osman, 1990; see also Proctor &
Reeve, 1990, for related discussions).
Recent work in judgment and decision making has extended the notion of compatibility and proposed that the
weight of certain stimulus attributes in judgment or in
choice is enhanced by their compatibility with the response
scale (Slovic, Griffin, & Tversky, 1990; Tversky et al.,
1988). The rationale for this principle is that the specific
nature of the response scale tends to focus attention on
the compatible features of the stimulus. For example, setting the price of a gamble is likely to emphasize payoffs
more than probabilities because both the price and the
payoffs are in monetary units (e.g., dollars). When a stimulus attribute and the response do not match, additional
mental operations are required to map one into the other.
As with the spatial mapping between stimulus and response ensembles, noncompatibility between a stimulus
attribute and the response scale requires additional mental operations, which often increase effort and error, and
reduce impact.
The principle of scale compatibility has recently been
invoked to explain a number of phenomena in judgment
and decision making. Consider, for example, the wellknown preference reversal phenomenon (Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1983; Tversky, Slovic, & Kahneman, 1990).
Preference reversal typically occurs when subjects choose
a lottery that offers a greater chance to win over another
that offers a higher payoff, but then assign a higher price
to the lottery offering the higher payoff than to the one
with the greater chance to win. This pattern of preferences, which violates classical decision theory, has been
observed in numerous experiments, including a study involving professional gamblers and conducted on the floor
of a Las Vegas casino (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 1973). Because the prices of lotteries are expressed in dollars, scale
compatibility implies that the payoffs, which are expressed
in the same units, will be weighted more heavily in pricing than in choice. Hence, the high-payofflottery will be
favored more in pricing than in choice, which predicts
the preference reversal phenomenon.
Slovic et al. (1990) present various other studies, ranging from predictions of market value to time preferences,
wherein the weight of a stimulus attribute is shown to be

547

enhanced by its compatibility with the response scale. In
one study, for example, subjects were presented with pairs
of hypothetical students who hadjointly taken two courses,
and whose grades in one course and ranks in the other
were provided: one had a higher grade in one course and
the other a higher rank in the second. Half the subjects
were asked to predict which student would achieve a
higher grade in a third course, and the remaining subjects were asked to predict which student would achieve
a higher rank. Compatibility implies that the relative
weight of grades to ranks will be higher for the group
that predicts grades than for the group that predicts ranks.
As predicted, the student with the higher grade was expected to perform better 56% of the time by the grade
group and only 49% of the time by the rank group (p <
.05). Finally, evidence for scale compatibility has also
been reported by Schkade and Johnson (1989), who, in
a computer-controlled experiment, were able to show that
subjects spent more time on, and thereby presumably focused more attention on, the stimulus components that
were most compatible with the scale of the response mode.
Naturally, compatibility effects tend to be mild, and limited in their ability to influence decision. When one option overwhelmingly surpasses another, a slight difference in the relative weighting of dimensions is unlikely
to alter a person’s choice. Yet in some instances, when
the decision is difficult and the options are of otherwise
comparable worth, compatibility can have a decisive effect on the determination of preference.
In what follows, a new pattern of choices is described
that is consistent with the notion ofcompatibility. Whereas
scale compatibility is a function of the correspondence between stimulus-attribute scales and the response scale, the
present proposal addresses the compatibility between the
reasons available for choosing or rejecting an option and
the particular task at hand. In particular, it is argued that
options’ positive and negative features are weighted
differentially, depending on whether the options are being chosen or rejected. Options’ advantages provide compelling reasons for choosing, and thus make choices easier to determine and justify to oneself and to others.
Options’ disadvantages provide natural reasons for rejecting, and thus make rejection easier to determine and
justify. Considerations of compatibility suggest that positive dimensions will be weighted more in choosing than
in rejecting, whereas negative dimensions will be emphasized more in rejecting than in choosing. In what follows,
this simple prediction is shown to generate some new and
counterintuitive results. Because there is neither a formal
definition of compatibility nor a general procedure for its
assessment, the analysis remains informal and incomplete.
The same is true about the application of the principle of
compatibility to perceptual and motor performance. However, just as a control panel is clearly more compatible
with some information displays than with others, so can
the compatibility ordering in the context ofchoice be sufficiently clear to allow experimental investigation. To elucidate the logic that guides our prediction, we begin by

<-----Page 2----->548

drawing an analogy to another, well-known, psychological phenomenon. We then present a number of studies
that document the predicted discrepancies between choosing and rejecting, and we conclude with a discussion of
the findings and their implications.
AN ANALOGY ANI) THE PREDICTION
In his contrast model of similarity, Tversky (1977)
presents a set-theoretical approach to similarity, in which
objects are represented as collections of features, and in
which similarity between objects is expressed as an increasing function of the features that they have in common, and a decreasing function of the features that each
object has and the other does not. Judgments of dissimilarity between objects are commonly assumed to be complementary to similarity judgments: dissimilarity is an increasing function of distinctive features and a decreasing
function of common features. Tversky suggests, however,
that because of a change in focus, judgments of similarity and dissimilarity may not be mirror images. In the assessment of similarity between stimuli, the subject—as
compatibility suggests—may attend more to their common features, whereas in the assessment of difference,
the subject may attend more to their distinctive features.
As a result, common features are predicted to loom larger
in judgments of similarity than injudgments of dissimilarity, whereas distinctive features are predicted to loom
larger in judgments of dissimilarity than in judgments of
similarity. This leads to a straightforward but surprising
prediction: A pair of objects with many common and
many distinctive features could be judged as more similar, as well as more dissimilar, than another pair of objects with fewer common and fewer distinctive features.
Tversky and Gati (1978) observed this pattern in the comparison of pairs of well-known countries with pairs of
countries that were less well known. For example, most
subjects in the similarity condition selected East Germany
and West Germany (the prominent pair) as more similar
to each other than Ceylon and Nepal (the nonprominent
pair), whereas most subjects in the dissimilarity condition selected East Germany and West Germany as more
different from each other than Ceylon and Nepal. Related
findings are reported in Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner
(1990). If similarity and difference are complementary,
the sum of percentages of those who choose a pair as more
similar and those who choose it as more different should
equal 100. Instead, the average share obtained by Tversky
and Gati for the more prominent pairs (113.5) was significantly greater than 100.
With Tversky’s similarity—difference example in mind,
let us return to choice. In particular, consider having to
choose one of two options, or alternatively, having to reject one of two options. Logically, the tasks are identical. According to classical decision theory, in a binary
choice situation it should not matter whether people are
asked which option they prefer, or which they would like
to reject. If people prefer the first they will reject the sec-

ond, and vice versa. Naturally, the more positive features
an option has, the more likely it is to be chosen and the
less likely to be rejected; conversely, the more negative
features it has, the more likely it is to be rejected and the
less likely to be chosen. Let each option a be characterized by a set of positive and a set of negative features,
denoted A + and A—, respectively, and assume a value
function, v, defined on these sets of features. Thus, a’s
overall value increases with v(A +) (a positive number)
and decreases with v(A —) (a negative number). The relative weights assigned to positive and negative features
when one is choosing, however, may differ from those
assigned when one is rejecting. To the extent that people
base their decisions on reasons for and against the options under consideration, they are likely to focus on reasons for choosing an option when asked to choose and
they are likely to focus on reasons for rejecting an option
when asked to reject. After all, one does not prefer an
option because of its relative disadvantages, nor does one
reject an option because of its advantages. Thus, the positive features of options (their pros) are expected to loom
larger in choosing, whereas the negative features of options (their cons) are expected to weigh more heavily in
rejecting. Assume, therefore, that there exist nonnegative constants ô and X such that
a is chosen over b
iff v(A~)+ ôv(A)

> v(B~) + ôv(B),

and
a is rejected in favor of b
iff v(A)

+ Xv(A) <

v(B~)+ Xv(B).

Thus, ô and X reflect the relative weights of negative features in the decisions to choose and to reject, respectively.
Note that if ö is very small, preference is essentially determined by the positive features, and if X is very large,
preference is determined primarily by the negative features. Consequently, we may obtain a situation wherein
a is chosen over b, and wherein a is also rejected in favor
of b, whenever
v(A) > v(B~)and v(A) < v(B).

That is, if—in line with compatibility—positive features
are weighted more heavily in choosing than in rejecting,
an option with greater positive and greater negative features could be chosen over, as well as rejected in favor
of, another option with lesser positive and lesser negative features. We shall investigate this prediction in the
following section.’
TESTS OF CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
Binary Problems
The problems in this section were presented to Princeton University undergraduate volunteers, who were paid
for their participation. The problems, two or three per
subject on the average, were arbitrarily inserted among

<-----Page 3----->CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
numerous other, unrelated problems in a booklet format.
Each problem presents a choice between two options: an
option with more positive and more negative features
(henceforth, the enriched option) and an option with fewer
positive and fewer negative features (henceforth, the impoverished option). By way of manipulation checks, for
each of the problems that follow, at least 85% of an independent group of subjects (N = 26) chose the enriched
option as the option “that has more reasons for and against
it” than the competing, impoverished option (p < .001
in all cases). Each problem was presented to two groups
of subjects: one group was asked to choose (award or indicate a preference for) an option; the other group was
asked to reject (deny or give up) an option.
Let H~and Hr denote, respectively, the percentage of
subjects who choose and who reject a particular option.
If choosing and rejecting are complementary (i.e., ô =
the sum H~+ Hr should equal 100. According to the rationale outlined in the previous section, on the other hand,
we should expect the enriched option to be chosen and
rejected more often than the impoverished option. According to this prediction, the value of H~+ Hr should be
greater than 100 for the enriched option and, consequently, smaller than 100 for the impoverished option.
Consider the following problem, which was presented
in two versions that differed only in the bracketed questions. One half of the subjects received the award version; the other half, the deny version. (In all the problems that follow, the enriched option appears last,
although the order presented to subjects was counterbalanced.)

reasons to be denied sole custody (such as health problems and extensive absences due to travel). To the right
of the options are the percentages of subjects who chose
to award and to deny custody to each of the parents. Parent B is the modal choice both for being awarded custody of the child and for being denied it. As predicted,
the value of H~+ Hr for Parent B (64+55 = 119) is significantly greater than the 100 that we would expect if
choosing and rejecting were complementary (z = 2.48,
p < .02). Because he/she presents better reasons for both
decisions, note that Parent B’s likelihood of obtaining custody is significantly greater when subjects decide whom
to award than when they ask themselves whom to deny
(64% vs. 45%, z = 2.49, p < .02).
As another example, consider the following problem,
in which half the subjects received theprefer and the other
half the cancel version.

and weaknesses varies with the nature of the task. The
gorgeous beaches play a greater role when we choose than
when we reject, and the lack of nightlife plays a more
central role when we reject than when we choose. As a
result, we are significantly more likely to end up in Spot B
when we ask ourselves which spot we prefer than when
we contemplate which reservation to cancel (67% vs.
52%, z = 2.0, p < .05).
Similar effects may be observed not only when the decision is to choose or to reject but, for example, when
we simply need to decide which of two options to opt for
first, and which to leave for later. Four hundred and
twenty-four undergraduates were presented with a description of two courses at a time when they were selecting
their next semester’s schedule:
Problem 3
Course X is considered an average course, with a reasonable
reading list, and with an average work load.
Course Y has an extremely interesting reading list and is taught
by a professor who is supposed to be very good. It has the
reputation of a tough course, slow-going at times, and it meets
more hours per week than the usual.

The subjects were asked to assume that they would eventually need to take both courses, but that one would be
taken in the coming semester and the other at some later
time. Half the subjects decided which course to take immediately, and the other half decided which course to
leave for later. Course X, the impoverished option,
presents no compelling reason either to take it immediately, or to postpone it until a later point. Course Y, the
enriched option, on the other hand, should be taken now
since the reading list, which is terrific, could change, and
the professor who is excellent could one day leave. Of
course, there are good reasons to postpone it too; it is
tough and it requires extra time. Students were significantly more likely to take Course Y in the coming
semester when they were deciding which course to take
than when they were deciding which to postpone (75%
vs. 65%, z = 2.25, p < .05). As predicted, Course Y’s
total share ofbeing taken and postponed significantly exceeded that of Course X (H~+ Hr = 75 +35 = 110, z =
2.16, p < .05).2
Alternative accounts. Neither anticipated regret (Bell,
1982; Loomes & Sugden, 1982) nor loss aversion (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1991) suffice to account for the present
findings. Regret is commonly considered a function of
what we have relative to what we could have had. Loss
aversion—the notion that losses loom larger than gains—
generally implies that losing the option we want most will
hurt more than losing an option we want less. While anticipated regret and loss aversion constitute important aspects of the psychology of choice, both predict that if we
prefer to have one option, we will prefer to lose the other.3
The preceding findings could result from subjects’ confusion when making decisions in what may be the less
natural frame. For example, subjects who clearly prefer

Option X may find it confusing when asked to reject one,
and may erroneously reject Option X, eventually endowing it with more than its fair share of selections and rejections. To explore this possibility, another 244 subjects
were presented with Problems 1 and 2 and were asked,
upon making their decision, to write down their reasons
for making that decision. Half the subjects received the
choose (or award) version ofthe two problems, the other
half the cancel (or deny) versions. The results of Problem 1 were in the predicted direction but failed to reach
statistical significance (Hr + Hr = 55 +53 = 108, p =
.20), whereas the data of Problem 2 replicated the previous findings (H~+ Hr = 63 +53 = 116, p < .05).
Two judges, blind to the present investigation, were then
asked to sort subjects’ responses according to whether
their stated reasons were in line with their indicated preferences. A subject was labeled inconsistent if he/she chose
Option X while providing reasons that indicated an intention to reject that option, or if he/she rejected Option X
while giving reasons for choosing it. The judges agreed
on over 90% of the subjects, and the few disagreements
were resolved by discussion. Across both problems, 9%
of the subjects were judged clearly or possibly inconsistent, their data were removed, and the analyses were
repeated. This had little effect: Problem 1 retained the
predicted direction (H~+ Hr = 107) without reaching
statistical significance, while the data of Problem 2 confirmed earlier findings (H~+ Hr = ll3,p < .05). Note
that these data include only subjects who provided consistent justification for their choices. Although confusion
may contribute to the choose—reject discrepancy in certain situations, it cannot account for these results.
A simple recipe: Negative versus no negative features. Consider two simple lotteries. One offers a lessthan-certain chance to win $50, and otherwise, nothing;
the other offers a greater chance to win more than $50,
and otherwise a small loss, say $10. Notice that there is
nothing
unattractive about the first lottery (you can only
win),4 but that there is the unattractive possibility of a
$10 loss in the second. This suggests a simple recipe for
constructing pairs of enriched and impoverished options
that will yield unequal shares of H~+ Hr. First, create
an enriched option by endowing it with a negative component while the impoverished option is accorded none.
To the extent that negative features loom large when options are rejected, the enriched option’s rate of rejection
should be comparatively high. Now, its positive component may be increased so as to make it the modal choice.
Consider the following two problems, created according
to this recipe, each presented to half the subjects in a
choice version and to the other half in a rejection version.
Choose:
Imagine that you were invited to play one of the following
two lotteries. Which one would you prefer?
Give up:
Imagine that you owned tickets to play the following two lotteries, but had to return one. Which one would you prefer to
give up?

As predicted, the enriched lottery’s share of ft + Hr
exceeds 100 in both cases (z = 4.12 and 2.83, respectively, p < .005 in both cases.)While the greater chance
to win a large amount leads an average of 76% of the subjects to choose the enriched lottery, the unparalleled possibility of a loss leads an average of 45% of the subjects
to reject it.
These two problems were replicated in a within-subject
design. Two hundred and forty-eight subjects received
both the choice and the rejection versions of these problems. Half the subjects received both versions of Problem 4; the other halfboth versions of Problem 5. The two
versions appeared in a booklet, separated by numerous
unrelated problems in between, with their order of occurrence counterbalanced across subjects. Because there
were no significant differences between problems or
orders, the data were combined. We call a subject consistent if, having chosen one lottery, he/she then rejects
the other, and vice versa. A subject is inconsistent if
he/she both chooses and rejects the same lottery. Whereas
a standard analysis based on error predicts that inconsistent subjects will be roughly equally distributed among
the two options, the present thesis predicts that a majority
of inconsistent subjects will have both chosen and rejected
the enriched rather than the impoverished option. Averaged over problems, 22% of the subjects exhibited inconsistent preferences (24% and 20% for Problems 4 and 5,
respectively). This corresponds quite well to the inconsistency rate implied by the between-subject manipulations above. More importantly, in line with the compatibility hypothesis, a significant majority of inconsistent
subjects chose and rejected the enriched rather than the
impoverished lottery (74% vs. 26%, p < .001).
Naturally, the preceding recipe for constructing enrichedimpoverished pairs applies not only to monetary lotteries. Consider, for example, the following hypothetical
problem, in which half the people were asked to choose
and the other half to give up an ice-cream flavor.
Problem 6 (N

When they finally make it to their favorite ice-cream
parlor, most people opt for their favorite flavor even if
it entails a less than perfectly healthy snack; but when they
have to forfeit a flavor, the fact that one is less healthy
constitutes for many subjects a good reason to reject it
in favor of the other, good and unobjectionable, flavor.
As a result, the excellent flavor’s high cholesterol content looms larger when it is rejected than when it is chosen,
causing this flavor to obtain more than its fair share of
selections and rejections (z = 3.22, p < .001). Note, incidentally, the obvious implications for a healthy diet: subjects were significantly more likely to consume the unhealthy (but more exciting) flavor when they focused on
which flavor to choose than when they contemplated
which flavor to reject.
Accentuating rejection. We generally tend to formulate and think of our decisions in terms of choosing rather
than rejecting. A majority (59%) of a group of people
we interviewed (N = 80) reported often paraphrasing the
question “Which of the options do you prefer to give up?”
into the question “Which of the options do you prefer?”
(and then giving up the other option), while many fewer
(14%) reported often paraphrasing the questions in the
opposite direction. The greater popularity of the choose
formulation implies that when asked to reject, a nonnegligible proportion of people will nonetheless entertain
the act of choosing, whereas, asked to choose, fewer consider the act of rejecting. In terms of the compatibility
principle, this implies a greater reliance on the positive
features in choosing than on the negative features in rejecting. This asymmetry is consistent with a recurring
trend in our results so far, in which the distribution of
preferences in the reject condition is closer to parity than
in the choose condition. The greater tendency to rely on
positive rather than negative features may be due in part
to the fact that we tend to associate choice with a search
for “positive” outcomes; less frequently (especially in
experimental settings) do we feel condemned to choose
among undesirable alternatives. The foregoing choices,
between, for example, monetary gambles, vacations, and
ice creams, were all generally desirable and thus more
likely to be perceived as involving selections than rejections, thereby emphasizing the positive dimensions. Other
decisions, however, are likely to accentuate the negative
dimensions. Having to decide between political candidates
that one dislikes, for example, may be perceived as trying to avoid the worst of two evils: we may be more invested in rejectingthe more objectionable candidate than
in choosing the candidate that we oppose less. In this vein,

example, document similar rankings of three lotteries obtained by choice and by rejection. The lotteries used by
these investigators, however, were unlikely to yield the
kind of compatibility effects documented above. The lotteries in their choice set differed (in a deliberately complicated fashion) in the exact distribution of prizes and
the probability of winning, but they all provided the same
potential amount loss, as well as the same expected gain.
In order to document choose—reject discrepancies in nonbinary choices, we resort to our earlier strategy of offering subjects an assortment of enriched and impoverished
options. Consider, for example, the following three lotteries.
Problem 8
1: You have a 50% chance to win $50, otherwise
nothing.
Lottery 2: You have a 60% chance to win $40, otherwise
nothing.
Lottery 3: You have an 80% chance to win $150, and
a 20% chance to lose $20.

Lottery

Halfthe subjects were asked to choose a lottery; the other
half were asked to reject one lottery, and then to reject
a second lottery (from the remaining two). According to
classical theory, when we present people with three options, it should make no difference whether we ask them
to choose one or to reject two. If, when asked to indicate
their preferred lottery, a proportion equal to H~of the
subjects should choose Lottery 3, then exactly 1 —H~of
the subjects are expected to include Lottery 3 among the
two that they reject.6 Instead, Lottery 3—the lottery offering by far the largest gain as well as the only lottery to
provide a potential loss—was chosen by 61% of those who

<-----Page 7----->CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
teries appear last, but the lotteries were presented to the
subjects in alternating order.)
The subjects were asked to imagine that they would
eventually get to play one of the six lotteries. One group
of subjects (n = 62) was asked to choose their preferred
lottery, another group (n = 63) was asked to reject their
least preferred, a third group (n = 61) was asked to choose
their five preferred lotteries, and a fourth group (n = 61)
was asked to reject their five least preferred. These are
summarized, respectively, in columns 2-5 of Table 1. The
left-hand numbers indicate the percentage of subjects who
chose each lottery when the task was to choose, or (in
parentheses) the percentage of subjects who failed to reject the lottery when the task was to reject. Similarly, the
right-hand numbers show the percentage of subjects who
rejected the lottery when the task was to reject, or (in
parentheses) the percentage of subjects who failed to
choose it when the task was to choose.
First, in line with our earlier findings, note that a
majority of subjects chose an enriched lottery as their most
preferred and a majority also rejected an enriched lottery
as their least preferred (53% and 76%, in the second and
third columns, respectively) Of more interest in the
present context, however, is the comparison between the
Choose I and Reject 1 and the Choose 5 and Reject 5
tasks. To the extent that subjects are expected to adopt
a consistent frame whenever they are asked to choose
among lotteries and whenever they are asked to reject
among lotteries, we may expect a high correlation between
the preference rankings obtained when one and when five
lotteries are chosen (columns 2 and 4) and, similarly,
when one and when five lotteries are rejected (columns
3 and 5). Instead, the observed correlations were quite
low (rank correlation coefficients for columns 2 and 4,
and for columns 3 and 5, are .43 and .09, respectively,
p > .05 in both cases). If, on the other hand, the instructions to choose five lotteries are converted by subjects into
the task of rejecting one and, conversely, the request to
reject five is converted into the task of choosing one, a
high correlation should be observed between the rankings
obtained via the Choose 1 and Reject 5 instructions and,
similarly, between the Reject 1 and Choose 5 tasks. In.~

deed, the rank correlation coefficients for these conditions
are 1.0 and .89, respectively (p < .05 in both cases).
The data suggest that having to choose five out of six
options is converted by subjects into the simpler task of
rejecting a single option. Conversely, the task of rejecting five out of six options is converted into the more natural task of choosing one alternative. Choice, according
to compatibility, is expected to give enriched options an
advantage over rejection. Indeed, while in the Reject 1
condition the three most frequently rejected options were
enriched options, in the Reject 5 condition (which apparently is converted into a Choose 1 task) two of the three
most frequently rejected options were impoverished options. Similarly, two enriched options were among the
three most frequently chosen in the Choose 1 condition,
but only one was among the three most frequently chosen
in the Choose 5 (which becomes a Reject 1) condition.
Observe that, unlike the results of earlier demonstrations
in which subjects were explicitly instructed to choose or
to reject, the present choose—reject discrepancies arose
out of subjects’ own formulation of the problems, which
were a function of the particular set sizes under consideration, not of explicit instructions. When a majority of options need to be chosen, the task is naturally seen as involving the rejection ofthe weakest; when a majority are
to be rejected, the task is seen as involving the choice of
a select few. The former, which according to the principle of compatibility focuses subjects’ attention on weaknesses, improves the chances of the impoverished options,
whereas the latter, which raises the relative weight of positive dimensions, favors the enriched alternatives.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Perhaps the most basic assumption of the rational theory of choice is the principle of procedure invariance,
which requires strategically equivalent methods of elicitation to yield the same preference order. However, empirical tests of procedure invariance have shown it to fail
in a systematic and predictable manner. For example, asking people to choose between two lotteries or, alternatively, asking them to state their price for each of these

lotteries often leads to a different preference order: the
monetary payoffs of lotteries weigh more heavily in setting a (monetary) price than in choosing, and the relative
prominence of the chance to win looms larger when one
is making a choice than when one is setting a price. The
present findings follow a similar logic: advantages are
weighted more heavily in choosing than in rejecting, and
disadvantages weigh more heavily in rejecting than in
choosing. Notice, however, that while the ordinal method
of choice and the cardinal method of pricing differ in response scale and are likely to involve different cognitive
mechanisms, choosing and rejecting are commonly regarded as two equivalent methods of arriving at the same
ordinal scale. If we compare the assessment of preference to the measurement of mass, we can think of choice
versus pricing as corresponding to the use of a pan balance
versus a spring. Choosing versus rejecting, on the other
hand, is like using the pan balance to see which option
sinks lower or, alternatively, to see which option rises
higher.
Our intuition is to treat choosing and rejecting as perfectly interchangeable. Often, when we find it hard to
make a selection (say, on a menu), we decide to “first
eliminate those options that we do not want.” Of course,
with some options this is a safe procedure—one may
strongly dislike spinach and would not order it no matter
what method one used. When presented with choice problems in which one option dominates (e.g., is better on
all dimensions than) another, people choose the dominating option and reject the dominated one. Often, however,
preferences among the options that remain after the strictly
weaker ones have been discarded are less clear. As the
present findings illustrate, in some cases one may end up
choosing an option one otherwise would have rejected.
In a study of personnel selection decisions, Huber, Neale,
& Northcraft (1987) presented subjects with actual
resumés and letters of application received by a firm in
response to an advertisement in a local newspaper, and
asked them either to list the names of all the applicants
that they would accept for an interview or to list those
that they would reject. Huber et al. found that significantly
more candidates were chosen for the job interview under
the rejection frame than under the acceptance frame. Although these authors interpret their findings in terms of
the risk attitudes induced by the different tasks, it is possible that a contributing factor is the type of information
available. Resumés are likely to be inherently biased
toward candidates’ strengths, with few weaknesses explicitly provided. When deciding which candidates to accept, subjects choose those with the most impressive qualities, but when rejecting candidates, hence focusing on
their weaknesses, subjects may find little to go by and
end up rejecting relatively few.
In certain circumstances, the focus on positive or negative features may be induced by the semantics of a question posed by an experimenter or an interviewer, whereas
in other cases it may be self-induced. Consider, for example, the last time you chose between jobs, or between
schools. Could it be that you focused too much on the

reasons for choosing—namely, the positive aspects—and
paid too little attention to the negative aspects that later
seemed to bother you more than you thought they would?
As discussed by Slovic et al. (1990), although compatibility can have a powerful effect on the expression of
preference, people are generally unaware of this phenomenon, which seems to operate at an elementary level of
information processing. It is doubtful, furthermore,
whether the bias can be eliminated by careful instructions
or monetary rewards, as is indicated by the failure of incentives to affect the prevalence of preference reversals
(Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1983).
Whether we end up choosing or rejectingmay often be
an accident of fate. Imagine that you plan to buy a rug,
and come upon two rugs that you like: one—the impoverished rug—is simple and fairly priced; the other—
the enriched rug—is quite lovely but expensive. You can
either choose one now, or take advantage of the store’s
offer to take both rugs home to decide. Whereas at the
store you are in the process of choosing and may be
tempted to opt for the more beautiful rug, at home you
would be deciding which to return to the store, and might
feel compelled to return the rug that you feel less able
to afford. According to the present findings, all else being equal, you are more likely to end up with the enriched
rug if you choose than if you return one. As illustrated
above, the size of the set under consideration may also
determine whether we end up choosing or rejecting. The
need to recommend 2 applicants from a pool of 10 is likely
to be seen as requiring the selection of 2, whereas having
to recommend 8 applicants from the same pool will most
likely be framed as requiring the rejection of 2. Relative
to the chances of an impoverished candidate, those of an
enriched candidate are predicted to be greater in the
former than in the latter scenario. Finally, temporal considerations may also influence the perspective that we
adopt. As pointed out by Bursztajn et al. (1991), clinicians make treatment decisions prospectively, with the
hope of improving the patient’s health, whereas judges
hearing malpractice cases must address such decisions
retrospectively, after a harm has occurred. Thus, the
courts tend to be more attuned to the potential harms of
the treatment than to its benefits, relative to the doctors
whose main concern are the potential benefits despite the
risk of harm. One possible implication of this disparity
is a greater propensity on the part of doctors to choose
enriched treatments—pnes that promise a variety of potential improvements—and a greater tendency on the part of
the courts to find fault with the very same treatments, because of their more numerous potential harms.
In a study concerning the perceived consequences of
risky behaviors, Beyth-Marom, Austin, Fischhoff, Palmgren, and Jacobs-Quadrel (in press) found persistent asymmetries in the perceived consequences of accepting and
rejecting a risky action. Among other things, they found
that the thought of taking a risky action produced four
times as many bad consequences as it produced good consequences, whereas the thought of not taking that action
yielded roughly equal numbers of good and bad conse-

<-----Page 9----->CHOOSING VERSUS REJECTING
quences. Because of such asymmetries, these authors suggest, it may be hard to understand people’s tendency to
take certain actions if one fails to elicit the perceptions
associated with not taking those actions. For example,
considerations such as “being liked by friends” or “feeling more grown up” appear to be less salient when youths
consider using marijuana than when they consider declining it.
We generally tend to think of our decisions in terms
of choosing rather than rejecting. Interestingly, the greater
popularity of the choose formulation (the “unmarked”
form) implies that the instructions to reject may ultimately
result in a less “biased” weighing of dimensions: asked
to reject, a considerable proportion of people nonetheless entertain the act of choosing, whereas, asked to
choose, few consider the alternative act of rejecting. This
raises the possibility that when inquiring about preferences
(in experiments, or surveys), we may want to consider
using the less common reject rather than the more biased
choose formulation or, better yet, some combination of
the two. (For a related discussion of the mixing of mortality and survival frames in medical decision making, see
McNeil, Pauker, & Tversky, 1988.) Naturally, further
theoretical analysis and empirical investigation will be required for researchers to clarify the nature of compatibility in general, and its role in choosing versus rejecting
in particular.
The principle of compatibility has been used in the
present paper to predict differential focusing on options’
positive and negative aspects, which are assumed to provide compelling reasons for choice and for rejection,
respectively. Naturally, compatibility is only one of a
number of factors that may affect the determination of
preference. Moreover, its influence is likely to be confined to choices among options between which it is otherwise hard to choose. Nonetheless, the notion that we reach
our decisions by relying on options’ positive and negative aspects, rather than overall subjective values, has a
number ofinteresting implications. Keeping overall values
roughly equal, options with more reasons for and against
them are more likely to be selected, both as winners and
as losers. Assume, for example, a competition for “athlete of the year,” in which all the contestants are equally
meritorious. If instead of relying on overall value we rely
on reasons for choosing the winner, it is likely that athletes in areas about which we are more knowledgeable
(e.g., basketball and baseball as opposed to javelin throwing and hang gliding) will present us with more reasons
for picking them as winners. Of course, if we were looking to select the overall loser, athletes in these same sports
would also provide us with most reasons for being picked
as losers. Thus, athletes in the more popular sports will
tend to be selected as athlete of the year, dogs of more
popular kinds will tend to win the dog shows, and cars
with more “features” in them will sell better. All this,
even if the more impoverished competitors—those about
whom less can be said—are equally deserving.
The preceding scenarios present us with the task of
choosing the winner and, as a result, we are predicted

555

to be biased towards the enriched options. In other situations, however, our main concern is to reject the losers,
and then we are predicted to reward the impoverished alternatives. Consider, for example, the initial weeding out
process conducted by selection conmtittees. Or the workings of special interest groups, who often consider it their
mission to oppose candidates who are particularly unattractive on certain dimensions. And assume a pool of contestants all of whom have their faults and their good qualities, but some of whom have more of both than others
do. To the extent that committees and special interest
groups, as well as regular voters, are strongly invested
in eliminating the candidates whom they perceive as having significant faults (with less emphasis on what may be
their good qualities), we are predicted to be left with the
impoverished candidates, politicians, and judges—those
who provide us with few reasons to oppose them. We are
predicted, to borrow Robert Musil’s words, to fill our
government and our courts with men and women without (positive or negative) qualities ~8
Like other framing and elicitation effects, the lability
of preferences implied by the choosing—rejecting discrepancy raises difficult questions concerning the assessment of values and preferences. We typically think of people’s choices as reflecting their underlying values. But if
one option is both chosen over and rejected in favor of
another, in what sense can we speak about subjective
values? Are people’s true preferences exhibited when they
choose or when they reject? Because invariance is normatively indispensable, no normative theory of decision
making can be reconciled with the present fmdings. More
importantly, perhaps, these findings may not be easily
reconcilable with our own intuitions. Next time we choose
an option, we had better verify that it is not also the option we most want to reject. Of course, it just might be,
which is why decisions are often so hard to make.
