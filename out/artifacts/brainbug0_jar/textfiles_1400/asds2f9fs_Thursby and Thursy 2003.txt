University Licensing and
the Bayh-Dole Act

he Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 allows universities to patent and exclusively license federally funded inventions. With

content/full/301/5636/1052 For the 84 U.S. institutions responding to
the Association of University Technology
Managers’ (AUTM) 1991 and 2000 surveys,
inventions disclosed increased by 84%, new
patent applications by 238%, license agreements by 161%, and royalties by more than
520% (1). Bayh-Dole advocates argue that in
its absence many results from federally funded research would remain in the laboratory;
critics say exclusive licenses are not needed
for technology transfer and universities are
chasing profits (2). Amid the rhetoric, what
are the issues and evidence?
Would technologies be transferred in
the absence of Bayh-Dole? Technology can
be, and obviously is, transferred to industry
without patents or licenses. Historically,
publications, meetings, and consulting
were the primary ways for industry to learn
about academic research, and recent evidence suggests they remain so (3–5).
If and when exclusive licensing is needed
to augment these channels is an important issue. Exclusive licensing may be needed when
inventions require further development before use (6). A survey of 62 U.S. universities
suggests that much university research fits
this profile, with 45% of inventions no more
than a “proof of concept” and only 12%
“ready for practical use” at the time of license
(7, 8). The failure rate for these inventions is
high, 46% for all inventions and 72% for
those that are only a proof of concept (9).
Exclusive patent rights provide an incentive
for firms to invest in costly development, but
only to the extent that patents are effective in
protecting intellectual property (IP), which
varies by industry (10, 11).
Many university inventions are research
tools, in which case exclusivity may limit use

by future researchers. Although Bayh-Dole
permits exclusive license, it does not require
it, and surveys show many licenses are nonexclusive (AUTM reports half) (2, 12). How often research tools are exclusively licensed is
not known, but known examples, such as the
OncoMouse, have exacerbated the controversy. Restricted use of such tools is more detrimental the broader their patent claims (13).
Regardless, NIH guidelines for sharing research tools are helpful (14).
Are technology transfer offices “profit
centers”? In the 2000 AUTM survey, 156
U.S. respondents reported $1.24 billion in
income from royalties and cashed-in equity net of unreimbursed legal fees (1, 15).
This income was about 4.7% of their research expenditure. For every dollar of income, there is about $0.20 in sponsored research tied to a license. The average income per active license is $66,465, but only 43% earned royalties and 0.56% earned
more than $1 million in 2000.
Although average income per respondent
was about $8 million, 79% earned less than
$5 million, and half reported income less
than $824,000. On average, technology transfer offices below the median had four employees, which made it likely that many spent
more than they received in income. While
more offices have become profitable over
time and this trend may continue, the current
picture suggests that profits are not the sole
goal of licensing. Survey research highlights
the complexity of university goals, which also include sponsored research and BayhDole’s mandate to commercialize federally
funded research (8, 16). Further, many in the
university community recognize the need to
balance IP rights and the public good (17).
Does licensing restrict dissemination of
academic research? A survey of industry licensing executives shows 27% of their university licenses include clauses that allow
deletion of information from papers before
submission, and 44% ask for publication delay (3.9 months on average) (18). Life science
faculty involved in commercial activity often
deny requests by other scientists for research
results, although multiple factors are involved
(19, 20). This problem is more likely related
to research that is company sponsored rather

than federally funded, because companies can
protect IP with secrecy, whereas Bayh-Dole
requires eventual disclosure through patents.
Have financial incentives from licensing
diverted faculty from basic to more applied
research? Evidence on the direction of faculty research is limited, but suggests that the
answer is no. A survey of firms that license
from universities indicates that the prime
reason for increasing their collaboration
with universities was receptivity to licensing
rather than a change in faculty research
(18). Studies of technology transfer from
the University of California, Stanford, and
Columbia find little evidence of either
changes in research direction or financial
return as a major motive for the research (6,
21). Our study of over 3400 faculty at six research universities from 1983 to 1999 suggests that the portion of research that was
basic has not changed even though licensing
increased by a factor greater than 10 (5).
There is evidence to suggest that university licensing facilitates technology transfer
with minimal effects on the research environment, but the issues are complex and
there are unknowns. Further study is needed,
particularly as to whether faculty involvement in licensing complements or substitutes for open publication. The environment
is also evolving. The explosive growth of licensing cannot continue forever—the final
equilibrium, however, remains to be seen.
