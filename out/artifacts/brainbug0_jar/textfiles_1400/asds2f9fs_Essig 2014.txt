Ownership, Failure, and Experience: Goals
and Evaluation Metrics of University-Based
Arts Venture Incubators
Abstract: This article expands on a paper originally presented at the annual
conference of USASBE in 2013.1 It is a narrative qualitative study of four university-based arts venture incubators, one of which is headed by the author. Its
purpose is to describe in narrative form the goals of such programs and the
means by which university-based arts venture incubators measure their success.
There is scant research on small business incubator evaluation and even less on
arts venture incubator evaluation. The article looks at four university-based arts
venture incubators to identify key issues of evaluation and similarities and
differences across program types.
Keywords: arts incubators, new venture creation, experiential learning

Executive summary
This article uses qualitative research methodology including content and structural analysis of both original interviews and published materials to describe,
within a narrative framework, the mission and goals of four university-based
arts venture incubators: The New Venture Challenge at Eastman School of
Music, the Creative Incubator at University of the Arts’s Corzo Center, the Pave
Arts Venture Incubator at Arizona State University (headed by the author), and
1 “Failure is a Necessary Condition: How Universities Measure the Success of Their Arts Venture
Incubators” was presented at the annual conference of US Assn of Small Business and
Entrepreneurship, January 2013. Subsequent to that presentation, additional material and
analysis thereof has been added to the article especially in the sections regarding Milliken
University, which was not included in the original study.

BC Studios at Millikin University. The essay is descriptive in nature and focuses
on the evaluation and assessment tools used by each program to measure
programmatic success against programmatic goals. The research indicates that
traditional measures of incubator success such as occupancy rates, jobs created,
or even venture success are not commonly used metrics in an educational
setting where individual self-efficacy and entrepreneurial thinking about the
arts and creative industries are primary goals.

Introduction: a question of intent
The purpose of my research is to describe the means by which university-based
arts venture incubators measure their success and to identify related issues for
future study. What are the goals and objectives of university-based arts incubators? What are the individual objectives of incubator participants? How are
programs or individuals measuring the attainment of those objectives? As the
head of one of the very few such incubators in the US, I became particularly
interested in the topic of arts incubator evaluation in 2011 when the Pave Arts
Venture Incubator undertook its first formal evaluation. Using a narrative framework, this article seeks to describe how university-based arts venture incubators
function and evaluate themselves. Ultimately, questions for subsequent research
may include: What impact do university-based arts venture incubation or seed
grant programs have on the university, the student participants, and the broader
discipline or culture? How is that impact assessed? The number of universityaffiliated arts incubators has doubled in the 18 months since this research
began, and the number of arts incubators beyond the academy is also growing.
Thus, university administrators, economic development officers, and artists
seeking to develop both programming and the means to evaluate it have an
interest in smart practices for both incubator programming and evaluation.

Sample and methodology
Based on an internet search, a keyword search of research databases, and a
review of information provided by the Arts Entrepreneurship Educators Network
(AE2N 2012), a very small list of university-based arts venture incubators can be
identified: CELEB at Beloit College, the New Venture Challenge at Eastman
School of Music, the Creative Incubator at University of the Arts’s Corzo
Center, and the Pave Arts Venture Incubator at Arizona State University. The

first of these, CELEB, was eliminated from this study, because the program
appears to be on hiatus upon the retirement of its director and because its
scope includes both the arts and the liberal arts. This leaves two subjects for
the study, Eastman School of Music and the Corzo Center, in addition to the
Pave Arts venture Incubator headed by the author. A fourth subject, BC Studios
at Millikin University, was added to the study following an initial round of
investigation, after it had been in operation for one full year.
Evaluation can be understood to be “the systematic process of collecting
and analyzing data in order to determine whether and to what degree objectives
have been or are being achieved” (Boulmetis and Dutwin 2005, 4). Thus, to
evaluate, one must understand program intent and objectives. To identify program objectives and intent, both publicly available sources and first person
interviews were analyzed. The three programs in the initial study have extensive
websites where text and video material are made available. These materials
represent the public face of the programs. I interviewed a total of three program
directors and one program director supervisor, six program alumni (two from
each program), one student currently at Eastman School of Music, and two
students still at Millikin University who have completed their incubator program. Alumni and students were identified through recommendation by the
program directors. Because student information is not publicly available and
three of the programs have very few alumni, random selection from within the
small pool of alumni recommended by the program directors was the only viable
means of identifying interview subjects.
Interviews were transcribed verbatim by a transcription service. Analysis
was done using the transcription, recording, and notes taken during the interview in tandem with one another. Longer narrative sections of the interviews
were analyzed structurally per Reissman (2008) to identify the abstract, orientation, complicating action, evaluation, and resolution of each narrative segment.
Thematic areas were identified in advance of questioning as (1) program objectives, (2) personal objectives, and (3) evaluative measures. Interviews were
analyzed for content related to those themes. The themes were derived from
the research questions, which in turn led to the interview questions. Qualitative
thematic analysis traditionally uses a grounded theory approach that derives
themes from within interviews. On the other hand, “narrative scholars keep a
story ‘intact’ by theorizing from the case rather than from component themes
(categories) across cases” (Reissman 2008, 53). Thus, interviews were analyzed
for the stories they told related to the themes identified advance. Interview
questions can be found in Appendix A.
To get to the question of intent, all respondents were asked “From your
perspective, what are the goals of the incubator or venture program?”

Administrators were asked whether or not there was a formal program evaluation in place and to describe that process. Students and alumni were
asked if they had participated in a program evaluation and the format of
that evaluation.

Background and context
What is an incubator?
The advent of the small business incubator
The definition of a venture incubator is currently undergoing a shift of focus.
A review of the scant literature on the topic illuminates the development of
the incubator model for small business acceleration. The National Business
Incubator Association (NBIA), the trade association for business incubators,
dates the incubator movement to 1959, when Joseph Mancuso developed the
Batavia Industrial Center (BIC). What distinguished the BIC as an incubator
rather than a mere office leasing facility was that Mancuso “didn’t just rent
space – he provided companies all kinds of assistance, from shared office
services to below-market rents to help securing financing” (Erlewine and Gerl
2004, 10). The oldest arts incubator is said to have been founded in 1986 in
Chicago (Kahn 1995), a year after the formation of the NBIA.

The scope of incubator services
The literature about the first wave of incubators focuses on defining an
incubator in terms of a physical facility. Allen and Rahman’s (1985) definition
is typical: “A small business incubator is a facility that aids the early-stage
growth of companies by providing rental space, shared office services, and
business consulting assistance” (p. 12). A meta-analysis almost 20 years later
defines an incubator not so much as a facility as “an enterprise that facilitates the early-stage development of firms by providing office space, shared
services and business assistance” (Hackett and Dilts 2004, 55). In this definition, the provision of space, a facility, is just one of several services provided
by an incubator to an entrepreneurial venture. The shift from incubator-asfacility to incubator-as-service-provider is delineated explicitly by Bergekk
and Norman (2008):

In the incubator literature, the relative emphasis on each component has varied over time,
from an initial focus on facilities and administrative services to a more recent emphasis on
the importance of business support (Peters et al., 2004). In our opinion the latter is the
most important – without business support activities, the denomination “hotel” is a better
description than incubator.
(p. 21)

Writing in 1995, Kahn defines arts incubators in a similar fashion to the first
phase of business incubator literature. “They are facilities that create a nurturing
environment for small and emerging arts organizations by offering low-cost or
subsidized space and services” (p. 1). However, arts incubators today describe
themselves less in terms of the provision of facilities and more in terms of
provision of services. Arts Incubator of the Rockies, one of the newest (it opened
in 2012) and most highly publicized arts incubators describes itself as “designed
to help you learn about the business of your art, connect with other artists
and communities, and gain the support and resources to succeed. AIR serves
the Intermountain West and provides programs for visual artists, writers, musicians, performers, designers, arts administrators, and other creatives” (Arts
Incubator of the Rockies 2012). AIR’s emphasis on services rather than facilities
is emblematic of the shift in the definition of incubators.

How are incubators evaluated?
Although there has been some significant research recently testing various
methods for measuring the impact of arts participation (e.g. Lord 2012), there
is little literature on measuring the impact of arts incubators. There is a similar
lacuna in the business incubation literature with regard to evaluation. Bergekk
and Norman (2008) point out, “no single evaluation framework [for business
incubators] has been developed” (p. 20). Allen and McCloskey (1990) describe
what they refer to as a “value-added” continuum, anchored on one end by the
incubator’s real estate development function and on the other end by its enterprise-development program (p. 64). University-based incubators, although
included by Allen and McCloskey near the enterprise-development end, do not
fit neatly there because the educational components of a university-based
incubator are not considered on their continuum. Instead, they consider three
criteria that delineate the ends and middle of the value-added continuum:
occupancy rates in the facility, jobs created, and firms graduated. Although
Allen and McCloskey’s criteria are statistically measurable, Voisey et al.
(2006), in their case study of a single incubator, conclude, “the measurement
of success needs to be broader than a set of statistical outputs” (p. 464). Bergekk

and Norman (2008) identify the failure of controlling for incubator goals in
previous studies, so that evaluation has been outcome-based rather than performance-based. They add, “few studies have put these outcome indicators in
relation to goals” (p. 22). Their analysis is particularly relevant, because the Pave
Arts Venture Incubator, the only program of the three under study to employ a
formal evaluation plan, uses a goals-based model for evaluation; interview
questions were, therefore, designed to tease out the programmatic goals of the
other programs.

Contest versus incubator: program descriptions
and goals
In this section, I describe each of the subject programs’ mission, goals, and
structure using information available on the institution’s websites and gleaned
from interviews with program directors and participants in order to better understand, to borrow Stake’s (2010) phrase describing the outcome of qualitative
research, how things work.

The Eastman School of Music’s New Venture Challenge
Business plan development is a key component of entrepreneurship pedagogy at
universities in the United States (Matlay 2008). The Eastman School of Music’s
“New Venture Challenge” describes itself as a business plan competition rather
than an arts venture incubator:
The Eastman New Venture Challenge is a contest to encourage new thinking and innovative ideas in music. It gives students the opportunity to develop a project proposal that
could result in the launch of a new entrepreneurial initiative.
Entries may be from individuals or teams of up to three students. Entrants must create
and present a project proposal that demonstrates creativity and potential for success. The
proposals will be evaluated in a preliminary round by a panel of judges who are experts in
the field. Two to four student entries will be invited to participate in the final round where
each initiative will be evaluated on both the written proposal and an oral presentation.
Successful entrants will have demonstrated creativity, innovation, uniqueness, and added
value to the music field. Project Proposals will be returned to all entrants with comments
and suggestions from the judges.
(Eastman 2012)

The goal of the program, stated in the first sentence of the description, is “to
encourage new thinking and innovative ideas in music.” A program alumnus

said that the program’s goal is to “promote music entrepreneurship.” Yet, the
actual launch of new ventures proposed in the competition does not appear from
the published material to be a programmatic goal or within the program’s formal
scope of activities. Can it be called an incubator? When asked if he considered
the New Venture Challenge program to be an incubator, the program director
replied, “we don’t have a formal incubator.” Implicit in his response is the
definition of the incubator as a place – a facility – in which ventures are
nurtured. His own subsequent evaluation of his statement, however, caused
him to question whether or not that definition is accurate. He continued, “but
we do help fund ideas and projects.” By the time he concluded his story of a
student who has developed a tuning device for an Indian drum, he had convinced himself that the New Venture Challenge is indeed an incubator, saying,
“If we see good ideas we would try to hook them up with um, you know, venture
capital people. In its own way it’s an incubator” (emphasis mine). A subsequent
interview with a different alumnus of the program confirms the incubation
function of the contest: “It gives students an opportunity to develop an idea
that they could pursue with the [sic] some funding.” The Eastman New Venture
Challenge thus fulfills an incubation function, at least for some of its participants, while not calling itself an incubator or having a fixed location for new
enterprises to set up their businesses.
A third alumnus offers a different perspective on whether or not the New
Venture Challenge serves an incubation function. He agrees that a goal of the
program is “getting people to think outside of the box” but felt that “unless you’re
doing … some sort of online based company, … the prize money isn’t really sufficient
to do much with it in terms of … a business.” This confirms the intentions found in
the published material: to spur thinking rather than new ventures.
Because new venture creation is not an official function of the program, it is
the five-step application process itself that delivers the program’s learning outcomes (“new thinking” about innovation in music). These steps include:
optional workshop, intent to apply form, full proposal submission, identification
of finalists, and finalists screening. Although the program information is not
specific about the final screening, a program alumnus indicated that having to
make a project presentation to the adjudicators was a means by which program
goals are achieved. The contest, he said, “would force you to develop that idea
enough to at least present the idea to some people who would judge it.” The
importance of this presentation was underscored when he repeated moments
later, that the contest “allows the students to uh, think about the idea critically
and … really develop it in some ways…. I think that for anyone that entered that
particular competition, uh, you really have to, um, develop and think about the
idea, because, you know, you have to present it.”

The University of the Arts Corzo Center Creative Incubator
The mission of the Corzo Center Creative Incubator at University of the Arts is
to “help UArts students and alumni develop new ideas, launch creative
business, and establish social enterprises” (Corzo Center 2012). With its
focus on business and enterprise development, the Corzo Creative Incubator
structure seems to be more traditionally an incubator than that of Eastman’s
New Venture Challenge. However, the Corzo Center description of services
does not include the traditional provision of space. In this, it bears more
resemblance to the Pave Arts Venture Incubator described following. Like
Pave, the Corzo Creative Incubator provides “help developing proposal,
advice on strategies, marketing, social media, business organization,
finances, accounting, and legal questions; business critiques; connections
to business, legal, and marketing advisors…; and workshops and special
program on topics related to entrepreneurship and business development”
(Corzo Center 2012).
In his interview, the director of the Corzo Center indicated that the incubator
supports ventures with the potential to be self-sustaining, but he also indicated
that there are more intrinsic goals: to “stimulate … the ability to think … in a
long term pragmatic way. Even recognizing, … probably a very small percentage
of these startups will succeed. But the … effort here is to incentivize people to
have to start to think about things that they haven’t normally thought about.”
The Corzo and Eastman programs share this common goal to incentivize new, or
perhaps unfamiliar, ways of thinking about the arts.
A program alumnus viewed the incubator and the Corzo Center’s programs
more generally as a way to bridge studies in art and design with an “independent” entrepreneurial existence. Both she and the program director discussed
the need for the Corzo Creative Incubator as being a product of the current
economic climate, the alumnus noting, “the way the economy is shifting right
now that we are very much in a design based economy, so there was a need, to
kind of facilitate, um or nurture, that um, to kind of bridge that gap.” In a
published interview (Berge 2012), the program director said, “To depend upon
the kindness of strangers in this economy is to lean against a wall that will
collapse. We need to show our students that what they learn empowers them to
change the world – to be great artists and media makers at the same time they
can become active citizens and economically self-sufficient.” From these
excerpts, it seems that the Corzo Creative Incubator views new venture creation
not as an end in itself, as a small business incubator might, but rather as a
means toward a broader educational outcome: the economic independence and
self-sufficiency of artists and designers.

The program director’s aspiration for the Creative Incubator extends beyond
educational outcomes, to broader economic and cultural impacts. The program
director shared, “One of the things I’m hoping to do … is take this idea and make
it more available throughout the region.” He sees the incubation of creative
enterprises as having the potential for positive disruption that Silicon Valley
start-ups had in northern California two decades ago:
I would love at some point then to see some of our ventures … begin to establish their own
businesses, their own product lines, uh, very much in the way that … Stanford did with …
the startups in the Silicon Valley area, so we can start to shore up an economy here that is
based in part on the intelligence and on strength of creatives who graduate, not only from
our school, but also from the regional area schools.

The Pave Arts Venture Incubator
A venture incubator is one of four activities undertaken by Arizona State
University’s Pave Program in Arts Entrepreneurship, of which the author is the
director. The other three are curriculum delivery, research, and public programming. Education goals are paramount in the program’s published description:
The Pave Arts Venture Incubator provides an experiential learning opportunity for selfmotivated student teams with big ideas. Students learn principles of entrepreneurship by
participating in a granting competition. Students accepted into the incubator develop a
project of their own with program guidance.
(Pave 2012)

The program’s incubation function is described thus, “Pave seeks to encourage
creativity and innovation in the arts by helping self-motivated student teams
develop and grow new projects ….” In its dual education and new venture
acceleration mission as well as its provision of services rather than facilities,
Pave is similar to the Corzo program. It differs from it materially in that only
current students are eligible to be accepted into the incubator and conceptually
in the strong focus on innovation in its award guidelines. The descriptors
“innovative” or “new” appear in all of the program’s award criteria.
Email correspondence with the director of the school in which the incubator
is housed (the program director’s supervisor) sheds light on the institutional
goals for the program, which are somewhat more expansive than the published
goals of the program itself:
1) promote long-term career success of our students by enabling and supporting entrepreneurial activities in parallel with their studies, 2) enrich the surrounding community with

strong, sustainable arts ventures and 3) explore new territory in the role of university arts
programs in terms of knowledge creation and market definition.

One of the program participants, whose product is still in development,
expressed a similarly broad view of the incubator’s potential impact in an
email, “The pave program is about supporting ARTS ventures that benefit the
arts and communities. It may be a venture that takes local arts to a new level, or
one that explores innovative techniques and implementations.”2 The program
steering committee may consider both the views of the supervisor and the
participant in revising its operational goals and subsequently its evaluation
plan.
Mentorship, along with the new venture creation experience, is one of the
primary means by which the incubator’s educational goals are met. The school
director [not the author] underlined, “One of the most valuable resources available to students developing entrepreneurial projects through the incubator is
access to faculty mentorship.” A participant shared via email that her mentor
“provided instrumental feedback on my company product itself, encouragement
and opportunities, as well as professional networking and publicity opportunities. It’s all about helping students realize that every dream is possible, even if
they don’t have the answer in the beginning … with persistence they will.”

BC Studios at Millikin University
The BC Studios incubator at Millikin University is quite different from the other
three programs in two distinct ways. First, it is administrated not within an arts
college or disciplinary arts unit, but rather housed within a center for entrepreneurship in the university’s business school. Second, the incubator is tied to a
specific class, “The Art of Entrepreneurship,” the second in a three semester
sequence of courses in its “Arts and Entrepreneurship Program.” The course
requires students to launch a micro-venture, provides a micro-loan to enable
them to do so, and subsequently requires repayment of that loan from sales
revenue in order to pass the class. The public description of the incubator
focuses on the traditional facility function of an incubator:
BC Studio is Millikin University’s arts and business incubator located in the lower level of
Blue-Connection Downtown. As part of their coursework in ET380 The Art of

2 Because the author was well known to the Pave Program interview subjects, questions were
distributed via email rather than in person or via phone as was the interview method for the
other programs.

Entrepreneurship, students are challenged with designing and pitching a new business
model with a home in BC Studios. Students who pass the pitch stage, receive a studio or
retail space and are open to the public during special events…
(Millikin 2013)

According to its director, the goal of the BC studios is education in new venture
creation: “The focus is on ownership… We want them to understand the elements of risk, control, and reward.” Although clearly more focused on the
mechanics of new venture creation than the other programs, one student, at
least, indicated that the program’s goals relative to entrepreneurial thinking
were similar to those of other programs: “I think the program is designed to
push students to think in a more out-of-the-box way, and to think on our feet,
and to be able to spot opportunities … fairly quickly.”
Projects accepted into the BC Studios incubator do not need to be innovative
or even, it seems, particularly artistic. The program director said, “It doesn’t
have to be new or unique… They have to be able to sell it.” Although the sample
size is too small to draw conclusions about differences across arts college-based
versus business college-based programs, the contrast between the Millikin
approach and those of the other three programs is, nevertheless, startling.

Measuring success and admitting failure
With goals as altruistic as “encouraging new thinking,” as far-reaching as
shoring up the regional economy, and as practical as understanding ownership,
how do these diverse programs evaluate whether or not they are achieving
them? If the generation of new ideas is an indicator of programmatic success
on their own, venture success may not be necessary. If education objectives are
paramount, how are learning outcomes measured? Both formal and informal
evaluations are employed in the four programs.

Formal evaluations
All four programs under consideration employ formal evaluative procedures for
assessment of applications to the respective programs but, according to the
interview subjects, only the Pave Program and Corzo Center employ an ongoing
program of evaluation of the program itself, while Millikin evaluates the
achievement of learning outcomes in the BC Studios incubator within the context of its entrepreneurship center. The Pave Program has several levels of

formal evaluation, in part to fulfill requirements of the Kauffman Foundation
grant that helped jumpstart the program. The Eastman and Corzo program
directors, however, initially responded to questions about evaluation with explanations of their rigorous processes for evaluating applicants. These directors
were then provided with clarification that in asking about evaluation they were
being asked about evaluation of the program itself. Each was explicitly
asked about formal program evaluations. The director of the Eastman program,
for example, was asked, “I actually was looking for something else in the
question about evaluation: not so much how you’re evaluating student projects
but does Eastman evaluate the Venture Challenge program?” He replied, “Oh.
[pause] no.”
The Corzo Creative Incubator program director explained that although
there is not an institutional level evaluation as is necessitated by the Pave
Program’s initial grant, there is a formal evaluative feedback mechanism,
“everyone who gets funded then gets a mentor who works with them and
gives progress reports along the way. …At the end we require every student,
everyone who’s funded to make a public presentation in which the judges and
others listen to and uh comment upon the nature of the work and where it is.
They are also required to make a report that goes online.” These video reports on
what the incubator clients have achieved or not achieved are not publicly
available. He also explained that workshop participants are asked to provide
feedback via a survey but added that “the test in this will be uh, to look at some
of these people after uh, two to five years out and then to see what they have
accomplished, what have they done to get them to reflect on their experiences
and what it provided them with.” The Corzo director notes, however, that in an
educational setting, “failure is an almost necessary condition of educating
students in a new area like this.” He was referring here to failure of the ventures
themselves, not of failure to educate. In the experiential learning context provided by an incubator, the director’s interest is in “seeing how intelligently the
failures have developed.”
The program-level evaluation plan for the Pave Arts Venture Incubator
includes a similar combination of workshop surveys and analysis of program
outputs in the form of ventures launched. The Pave Program evaluation looks
not only at the ventures themselves to assess learning outcomes but also at the
various stages of the proposal process. The Pave program’s overall goal (i.e.
encompassing all program areas, not only the incubator) is to “educate students,
artists and educators about how the principles of entrepreneurship can support
the development of creative opportunities for artists of all kinds” (Pave 2010).
The Pave evaluation plan (2011) calls for this learning objective to be measured
via a survey distributed and collected at the incubator grant writing workshop

held annually. Student persistence and effectuation are evaluated by comparing
the number of students invited to make full application after submitting a letter
of intent with those who actually do and then subsequently comparing the
number of applications approved with the number of ventures developed.
Students accepted into the Pave incubator are asked to report on their project
periodically and at least twice per year.
The BC Studios program director recognizes the need for formal evaluation but feels it is too early to undertake such an evaluation. “We want to be
able to see what the impact is after they graduate,” he said [note that the
incubator course had only been offered for three semesters at the time of the
interview]. He indicated that they intend to measure the “number of businesses” and “kind of revenue generated.” He also acknowledged the need to
measure the intangibles: “There’s a third element that we haven’t quite
figured out that we know needs to be there; that’s not the financial end of
it. I’m not sure what that is yet.” What he seems to be alluding to here is the
measurement of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, as discussed later. The rubric
currently used for program evaluation includes four categories that reflect the
activities of the new venture creation process, but only indirectly the entrepreneurial mindset: recognizing opportunity, assessing risk, marshaling
resources, and business ownership.

Informal evaluations
The directors of both the Corzo Creative Incubator and Eastman New Venture
Challenge programs are cognizant of the informal programmatic feedback
received through the engagement of external evaluators in the student application process. The Eastman director noted, “the people who are in the final
rounds are the dean of the school … and another high ranking dean, myself,
and … an entrepreneurship type person … and those people see what’s going on
and they like it really.” Thus, the larger institution, both Eastman and its parent,
University of Rochester, are made aware of the program and have an opportunity to provide institutional feedback. Program alumni, one of whom shared that
although there was no formal survey of participants, he “brainstormed” with the
program director and others about the program, also provide informal feedback.
This individual’s use of the word “brainstorm” indicates an intentionality on the
part of the program to actively seek the input of participants, albeit in an
informal context. Another alumnus indicated that the program staff had reached
out to program alums, “they sort of checked in with us to see, uh, what we, you
know, if we’re working on a project, and kind of where we are.”

An alumna of the Corzo incubator related that she provided the program
director with direct feedback in a series of informal meetings (they meet for
coffee with some regularity). This alumna told the director that she needed to
“know the language of business,” but that the incubator experience had not
provided her with that knowledge. She indicated that through the post-incubator
informal meetings, the director had heard her critique. When asked directly (see
Appendix), neither this interviewee nor another program alumna indicated that
she had participated in the formalized feedback loop described by the director,
at least not as part of an evaluation process. Instead, the second alumna
described an information-sharing opportunity, in which there was a “presentation evening where um, people who were a part of it, or were applying, or were
interested in applying in the future came, and so we talked and told them a little
bit about our status and we saw their business and talked about their status and
then we will talk about their ideas, and um, it was helpful.” Although this
participant did not see this activity as part of a program evaluation, the director
positions such events as part of an overall perspective on and assessment of
program activities.
The four programs are summarized in a table as Appendix B.

Discussion
Self-efficacy
The Pave Program in Arts Entrepreneurship shares many goals, structures, and
evaluation techniques (both formal and informal) with the other three programs
under consideration here. However, in addition to its educational and economic/
cultural enrichment goals, Pave includes as a goal, “to assist individual students
in increasing their self-efficacy in relation to artistic creativity” (Pave 2011).
Although the term “self-efficacy” does not appear in the public documents of
the Corzo, Eastman, or Millikin programs or the interviews, several students
discussed the positive effect the incubator programs had on their self-efficacy. I
introduce the topic here because of its weight in both the Pave Program’s
evaluation plan and in the literature about entrepreneurship (see, for example,
Chen, Greene, and Crick 1998) and entrepreneurship education. In this context,
self-efficacy can be understood to mean belief that one is capable of assuming
the responsibilities of new venture creation (Forbes 2005).
When asked if the Eastman New Venture Challenge experience had had an
effect on his work as an artist, one alumnus responded, “I wouldn’t say it, it

really impacted my, my creative output as a composer or, you know, as a
performer, I play saxophone, I think it just it, it has had an effect on the way
that I think about myself, in general you know, as a complete package, my whole
career” (emphasis mine). Another Eastman alumnus characterized entrepreneurship itself as “really a way of thinking; a way of sharing one’s unique ideas and
talents.” These students appear to have increased their self-efficacy related to
entrepreneurship, despite that there is no explicit use of the term “self-efficacy”
in program materials.
The Corzo Center director, in discussing the possibility of venture failure
also characterized educational success in ways that sound like self-efficacy: “I
can see the growth and development, coming from the students, what they now
know, what they can tell me, what they tell each other. Remarkable, real
exciting and they feel that sense of real confidence and strength.” That confidence and strength, a form of self-efficacy, can support arts students as they
venture outside the walls of the academy to engage in entrepreneurial activities.
Millikin’s focus on “ownership” also appears to be related to self-efficacy. A
graphic design student who had gone through the incubator and was preparing
to graduate noted that the experience “kind of gives you a confidence and the
knowledge to be able to be treated the way you should be.” Additionally, she
noted, “having a business background allows you – teaches you – how to
present yourself.” This student had not entered the incubator with that confidence, that entrepreneurial self-efficacy, but developed it through the experience of creating a business.

Outcome measurement
Most of those interviewed for this study indicated that “encouraging thinking” in
a value-based way about the arts is a goal of the program with which they are
affiliated. Cope (2005) conceptualizes entrepreneurship itself as an ongoing
process of learning, extending beyond previous views of entrepreneurship as
function, trait, or behavior. What, then, are the measurable outputs of the
entrepreneurial “thinking” encouraged in the academy and in the continuous
learning process that follows? The preliminary business plans that constitute the
application to the programs are one such output, as are the new ventures that
result. Is the success and longevity of such ventures evidence that the learning
outcome is met? I suggest, instead, that the launch activity itself is adequate
evidence of a successful learning outcome. The venture does not need to
succeed per se in order for the learning outcome to be met. As the Corzo
Center director indicated, in an educational setting, failure is a necessary

condition. Students, too, appreciate the opportunity to fail: “If we fail here it’s
OK … at least when we find that a plan isn’t feasible here, we can find a way to
get back on our horse or make it better or tweak it. That way, when we graduate
we can be successful” (Millikin student).

Conclusion
Small business incubators are most often started to fulfill economic development functions. University venture incubators may serve a similar function, in
addition to providing a venue for tech transfer and experiential education. Arts
incubators, however, may not be founded with similar economic development
expectations; university-based arts incubators even less so. The number of
university-affiliated arts incubators is growing rapidly with new programs
announced or launched by University of Chicago, Colorado State University,
the College for Creative Studies, and Ball State University since the start of this
study. As universities look to initiating or growing robust arts entrepreneurship
programs, the implementation of an arts venture incubator or an arts venture
business competition can be one means toward achieving learning outcomes
and enhancing student self-efficacy. By designing evaluation plans based on
those learning outcomes, programs can use evaluative feedback in a process of
ongoing program development and improvement.
