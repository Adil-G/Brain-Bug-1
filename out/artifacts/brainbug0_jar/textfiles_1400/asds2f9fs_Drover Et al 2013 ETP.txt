The Effects of Perceived
Control on Venture
Capitalist Investment
Decisions: A
Configurational
Perspective

Drawing on agency and configurations theories, this study examines how perceived level of
control over the entrepreneur influences venture capitalist (VC) decision making. We model
the direct effects of perceived control and the interactive effects of control with entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity attractiveness to determine how various combinations of
factors influence VCs’ willingness to invest. We test our conceptualizations using conjoint
analyses of 552 VC investment decisions. The results show that perceived control is directly
related to investment likelihood, but different configurations of control, entrepreneur prestige, and opportunity attractiveness result in different outcomes. Our findings support a
configurational perspective of VC decision making.

Introduction
“If the investor group will not have control over who runs the show—it is hard for me
to pull the trigger”—Venture capitalist interviewed for this study
Resource commitment is a key step in the entrepreneurial process, and because
venture capitalists (VCs) are key players in the resource game, researchers have paid
significant attention to VCs’ investment decisions (cf. Ahlstrom & Bruton, 2006; Walske
& Zacharakis, 2009). A National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) report highlights
the importance of VCs in entrepreneurship, indicating that by the end of 2011, VCs had
$197 billion under management in entrepreneurial firms in the United States (NVCA,
2012). Because of this criticality, academic researchers have taken considerable steps

<-----Page 1----->toward achieving a deeper understanding of how VC investments unfold (e.g., Chen, Yao,
& Kotha, 2009; Payne, Davis, Moore, & Bell, 2009; Petty & Gruber, 2011; Shepherd &
Ettenson, 2000; Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001). Moreover, this research has demonstrated
that VCs are often heavily involved in the ventures in which they invest (Fried, Bruton, &
Hisrich, 1998; Gorman & Sahlman, 1989), suggesting that in many cases, VCs see the
need to closely monitor and control entrepreneurs’ actions. By deduction, this means that
VCs are likely to consider the degree to which they will have control over entrepreneurs’
actions as they evaluate investment opportunities (Amit, Glosten, & Muller, 1990;
Wijbenga, Postma, & Stratling, 2007). In that regard, control is likely to play an influential
role in the VC investment decision-making process.
Leifer and Mills (1996) formally define control as a regulatory process by which
standards and mechanisms are established to improve predictability and the ability to
attain a desired state or objective. Thus, control can be thought of as the VC’s ability
to monitor and direct the entrepreneur’s actions in the postinvestment period. The idea
that VCs may want to control entrepreneurs’ actions can create problems because most
entrepreneurs want to maintain autonomy even though they must forfeit some freedom in
exchange for much-needed capital. Wasserman (2008, p. 104) highlights this phenomenon
in his analysis of start-ups, revealing that founding entrepreneurs often harbor attitudes
that resist control. Specifically, he documents that many founders maintain the following
notion: “I’m the one with the vision and the desire to build a great company. I have to be
the one running it.” This type of thinking, alongside that expressed by the VC in the
opening quotation, highlights that control is clearly an important factor for both VCs and
entrepreneurs, and may result in tension in VC investment decisions (Bonini, Alkman, &
Salvi, 2012; Payne et al., 2009). As such, VC investment deals often involve a variety of
negotiated control mechanisms, such as the ability to modify the management team and
compensation structure (Barney & Busenitz, 1996; Lerner, 1995; Sahlman, 2003), rights
to allocate cash flows (Kaplan & Strömberg, 2003), and the ability to stage financing or
build co-investing structures (Steier & Greenwood, 1995).
Despite the importance of control in VC investment, the relationship between
VCs’ perceived level of control and their decisions to invest in ventures has yet to be
theoretically modeled and empirically tested. As such, we have limited knowledge
about how control factors into VCs’ investment evaluations, and more critically, we lack
insight into the conditions under which control may be more or less impactful.
As a result, we know relatively little about how VCs’ perceptions of entrepreneurs’
willingness to accept VCs’ formal and informal control mechanisms might influence
investment decisions. It follows that we also have a limited understanding of the circumstances under which other deal attributes (e.g., opportunity attractiveness) might
enhance or trump VCs’ need for control. Further, we are left to wonder how VCs react
in suboptimal environments where deal attributes, such as control, are not at optimal
levels. This clearly inhibits our understanding of how deal characteristics coalesce as
VCs evaluate investment opportunities.
To address these issues, we develop a theoretical model that articulates the role of
perceived control in VC investment decisions. To do this, we adopt logic and inferences
from agency theory, which is based on the idea that when firm ownership (e.g., VCs) and
management (e.g., entrepreneurs) are separate entities, competing interests may develop
(Jensen & Meckling, 1976). It is well documented that entrepreneurs sometimes exhibit
individual utility-maximizing behavior that is misaligned with investor goals (Bitler,
Moskowitz, & Vissing-Jorgensen, 2005; Castrogiovanni, Combs, & Justis, 2006; Gorman
& Sahlman, 1989). This suggests that capital providers must take steps to align entrepreneurs’ interests with those of investors to ensure resources are used optimally and

<-----Page 2----->maximum financial returns are realized (Amit, Brander, & Zott, 1998; Amit et al., 1990;
Bohren, 1998).
Agency theory is a useful theoretical lens because it provides an overarching framework explaining how competing interests may develop in the VC–entrepreneur relationship (Jensen & Meckling, 1976) and how control mechanisms may be used to align
interests in a way that improves the odds of superior financial performance. However,
considerations of perceived control do not happen in a vacuum, so we extend the agency
perspective to consider that the effects of control may vary in the presence of other deal
characteristics. Specifically, we use the configurations approach (e.g., Hill & Birkinshaw,
2008) to investigate interactions that may exist when control is considered alongside
the entrepreneur’s prestige (D’Aveni, 1990) and the opportunity’s attractiveness (Haynie,
Shepherd, & McMullen, 2009), both of which have proven influential in prior VC
investment evaluation studies (cf. Murnieks, Haynie, Wiltbank, & Harting, 2011).
Through the configurations lens, we are able to explore equifinality and trade-offs
between investment deal characteristics, recognizing that an optimal—yet potentially
rare—configuration may exist and that in the absence of the optimal, the presence of some
positive characteristics may “fill the void” created by the presence of less desirable
characteristics.
Our model and empirical findings make important contributions to the body of
research on VC investment decisions (e.g., Chen et al., 2009; Petty & Gruber, 2011;
Shepherd & Ettenson, 2000; Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001). First, our study is one of the
first to theoretically model and empirically test the effects of perceived control on VC
investment decisions. As such, our study is positioned to shed new light on the role that
perceived control is likely to play as VCs evaluate investment opportunities, and this
improved understanding is likely to be of value to VCs and entrepreneurs alike. Second,
our study is unique in that it offers predictions and empirical insights that are only
derivable by considering the circumstances under which control occurs alongside other
important opportunity investment characteristics. By taking the configurations approach,
we offer both theoretical and empirical contributions that move the literature forward
by examining the idea that the effects of control may be dependent—and perhaps even
subjugated—in the presence of important structural factors (March, 1994) like the entrepreneur’s prestige (Franke, Gruber, Harhoff, & Henkel, 2008; Hsu, 2007) and the opportunity’s attractiveness (Hall & Hofer, 1993; Haynie et al., 2009; Zacharakis & Meyer,
2000). Our approach provides empirical evidence that VCs’ decision processes can be
more comprehensively understood when simultaneously considering multiple factors, and
that ideal arrangements and trade-offs between deal characteristics exist that may lead to
equifinal outcomes. The net effect is an improved understanding of how deal variables
come together in a way that makes VCs more or less sensitive to the need for control over
entrepreneurs’ actions.

Control in VC Decision Making
The potential for conflict in investor–entrepreneur relationships has been well documented, and the literature suggests that at least three types of agency problems are likely
to surface (cf. Hellmann, 1998; Kaplan & Strömberg, 2003, 2004; Sapienza & Gupta,
1994). The first type is adverse selection, which refers to the uncertainties that investors
(VCs in this case) face in terms of preset expectations of the human capital seeking
funding (Amit et al., 1998). Since proposals are often presented by unfamiliar entrepreneurs and are centered on unique differentiating attributes (Elitzur & Gavious, 2003),

<-----Page 3----->uneven knowledge distribution often surfaces, which gives rise to a number of potentially
hazardous circumstances. For example, an entrepreneur might manipulate information
and projections by over-forecasting future performance and under-forecasting expected
obstacles in an effort to attain maximum funding (Markman, Balkin, & Schjoedt, 2001).
Trust can help overcome this obstacle (Maxwell & Levesque, 2011), but significant
knowledge gaps often persist between the information that entrepreneurs have and the
information that they disclose to potential investors (Amit et al., 1990; Barry, 1994;
Berggren, Olofsson, & Silver, 2000). Further, trust—defined as accepting vulnerability to
another party (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998)—may not be viable given the
lack of interaction between entrepreneur and investor in the preinvestment stage of interest
in this study (Payne et al., 2009).
The second potential agency conflict is that of moral hazard (Holmström, 1979;
Lerner, 1995). Moral hazard occurs when entrepreneurs do not act in investors’ best
interest. For example, “if there are private benefits from continuing a project, entrepreneurs may keep the project going even if it has negative expected profits” (Wang & Zhou,
2004, p. 132). Related to the threat of moral hazard is a third possibility—namely, the
concern that entrepreneurs will “hold up” the investor. This transpires when the venture is
operated by valuable human capital that may threaten to leave (Hellmann, 1998; Kaplan
& Strömberg, 2003). If the entrepreneur’s knowledge, skills, and abilities are central
to venture success, the entrepreneur has leverage over the investor that may be used to
maximize the entrepreneur’s self-interest.
The ubiquitous presence of the agency conflicts outlined above could potentially
result in tenuous relationships between VC investors and the entrepreneurs they back.
Thus, VCs rely on a number of governance and control mechanisms designed to align
entrepreneurs’ interests and behaviors with those of VCs, thereby reducing the threat of
adverse selection, moral hazard, and holdup (Bruton, Fried, & Hisrich, 2000; Gompers &
Lerner, 2004). These controls are not necessarily structured in a standardized fashion
across the venturing community; rather, levels of control within a particular investment
generally take different shapes depending on each unique situation. As such, the presence
and/or stringency of various mechanisms tend to vary. Specifically, control safeguards
such as the ability to modify the management team (Barney & Busenitz, 1996; Hellmann
& Puri, 2002), alter the compensation structure (Sahlman, 2003), dilute the founder’s
equity stake (Gompers & Lerner; Sahlman, 2003), utilize ex-ante and ex-post staged
funding (Kaplan & Strömberg, 2004; Tian, 2011), transfer financial control (Kaplan &
Strömberg, 2003), and exercise liquidity rights (Kaplan & Strömberg, 2003) are among a
number of widely used controls that emerge in a variety of configurations that are
contingent upon the level of negotiated control. The implementation of such instruments
can afford VCs the opportunity to take significant control of ventures if suboptimal
performance or unanticipated opportunistic behavior ensue (Kaplan & Strömberg, 2003,
2004). Thus, for VCs, the concern is the degree to which they can reduce uncertainty and
agency concerns by monitoring and controlling entrepreneurs’ actions (De Clercq &
Manigart, 2007; Kaplan & Strömberg, 2003; March, 1994; Metrick & Yasuda, 2011). As
an implication, whether entrepreneurs appear amenable or resistant to accepting control
mechanisms is likely to influence the degree to which VCs will be willing to invest in the
entrepreneurs’ projects.
The arguments outlined above are derived from the logic and inferences found in
extensive and established literature streams. As such, they suggest what may be a seemingly intuitive relationship between perceived control and VCs’ willingness to invest.
However, we point out that while alluded to in the literature, this relationship has not
been formally argued, hypothesized, or empirically tested, so we do so here. Further,
4

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->establishing the conceptual logic behind the control–investment relationship is a necessary precursor to theorizing about the control-related interaction effects discussed in the
sections that follow. Thus, we formally state our first hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: There is a positive relationship between the VC’s perceived control
over the entrepreneur and willingness to invest.

Control and the VC Decision-Making Nexus
While the direct relationship between control and willingness to invest is clearly
important for understanding VC decision making, prior research tells us that a nexus of
factors determine entrepreneurial activity (Sarason, Dean, & Dillard, 2006; Shane,
2003). This means that in real-world situations, control is unlikely to be considered in
isolation. Agency theory tenets suggest that there are situations in which interest misalignment and information asymmetries are more or less prevalent, and control becomes
a bigger or lesser concern. In VC decision making, there are a number of factors that
might create such conditions. For example, Murnieks et al. (2011) highlight the work of
Franke et al. (2008), who used a range of studies to identify founder quality and economic quality of the opportunity as two of the most important VC investment decision
criteria. The implication for our model then is that certain founder and opportunity
qualities may give rise to situations in which agency threats are more or less salient, and
thus the influence of control varies as a function of these qualities. Following this logic,
and building on Franke et al. and Murnieks et al., we now consider the degree to which
perceived control might influence investment decisions given various levels of founder
and opportunity quality.
Although there are a number of founder and opportunity qualities that may influence
the effects of perceived control, this study examines the primary contingencies of (1)
entrepreneurial prestige (i.e., experience and affiliations) as an indicator of a high-quality
entrepreneur (D’Aveni, 1990; Hsu, 2007; Packalen, 2007) and (2) opportunity attractiveness (Gartner, 1985; Haynie et al., 2009) as an indicator of a high-potential opportunity.
We selected these variables (and not others) because a priori assessments of an opportunity’s profit potential are subjective to the individual (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), and
when VCs see indications that the entrepreneur is well regarded or that the opportunity has
high potential, they are more likely to invest (Murnieks et al., 2011). Viewed in light of
agency theory logic, this suggests that there are situations in which a VC may be more or
less focused on the threat of adverse selection, moral hazard, and holdup depending on the
entrepreneur’s prestige or the business opportunity’s potential. For instance, in the presence of highly attractive opportunities, VCs may perceive that there are greater opportunities for adverse selection and holdup that may prevent them from receiving maximum
returns. In such instances, VCs may focus more heavily on control. It is this type of
contingency effect that we explore from a configurations perspective (e.g., Burton, Lauridsen, & Obel, 2002, 2003; Payne, 2006). Taking such a perspective is necessary because
control can only be fully understood when one simultaneously considers the quality of the
entrepreneur and the opportunity.

Entrepreneurial Prestige and Control
Prestige is an inherently broad term, and in order to be conceptually clear, we follow
D’Aveni’s (1990, p. 121) conceptualization that prestige is “the property of having status.”
January, 2013

<-----Page 5----->D’Aveni contends that prestige is subjective and socially situated, so individuals can
develop prestige in a number of ways. Prior success, degrees or affiliations with elite
educational institutions, placement on boards of directors, or holding high-level positions
at some point in one’s career are just a few of the ways that individuals develop prestige.1
Applied to the domain of entrepreneurship, prestige is important as a sizeable body
of research shows that potential investors rely heavily on subjective criteria related to
managerial prestige when evaluating venture viability, such as the background, prior
record, affiliations, and other related characteristics of the entrepreneur and management
team (i.e., Franke et al., 2008; Hsu, 2007; Packalen, 2007; Zacharakis & Shepherd,
2001). The logic is that key players’ credentials act as indicators of competence (Packalen;
Pennings, Lee, & Witteloostuijn, 1998), as highlighted by Shepherd’s (1999, p. 625)
argument that VCs manage uncertainty by “choosing a management team they believe
will be able to cope with expected and unexpected changes in the market and competitive
environment.” In addition, renowned VC John Doerr (provider of financing to Google
and Amazon) expands upon the importance of such characteristics in the investment
evaluation by stating, “I always turn to the biographies of the team first” (quoted in Camp,
2002, p. 25).
While entrepreneurial experience and high-status affiliations clearly play an important
role in investment decision policies (Packalen, 2007), prestigious entrepreneurs may
be more outspoken and insistent upon approaching the venture according to their own
perspectives and objectives as opposed to those of the VC. Indeed, entrepreneurs’ and
VCs’ venture objectives can differ greatly, leading to serious tension and disagreements
(Cable & Shane, 1997; De Clercq & Sapienza, 2006). For instance, VCs typically desire
high-growth ventures with early exit opportunities while entrepreneurs tend to focus on
long-term growth and profitability (Turcan, 2008). Such divergent objectives may lead to
agency-type disagreements over how the firm should be directed, and subsequently, less
optimal outcomes (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001).
The extent to which the VC and the entrepreneur agree upon common goals
and values is positively linked to venture success (Bruton et al., 2000; De Clercq &
Sapienza, 2006). From the VC’s perspective, a high level of perceived control is especially desirable when an agreement is made with a prestigious entrepreneur because it
may mitigate potential conflicts with regard to moral hazard, risk, and venture objectives
(Turcan, 2008; Wang & Zhou, 2004). Further, such a scenario may suggest that the
prestigious entrepreneur—with presumably more knowledge of how VCs operate—has
purposely chosen to work with the VC instead of using other financing options because
of similar views and objectives. VCs are not necessarily interested in running the business but want to ensure that entrepreneurs remain motivated and that adequate progress
is being made toward a successful outcome (De Clercq, Fried, Lehtonen, & Sapienza,
2006). Therefore, high levels of managerial competence, combined with the ability to
control or alter the venture’s actions, provide a desirable scenario for the VC. Formally,
we state the following:
Hypothesis 2: There is an interaction effect between the entrepreneur’s prestige and
perceived control such that as prestige increases, control has a greater influence on
willingness to invest.

1. Prestige is similar to reputation, which is increasingly seen as playing an important role in the emergence
of entrepreneurial opportunities (cf. Wood & McKinley, 2010).

6

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Opportunity Attractiveness and Control
No matter how skilled the entrepreneur is, the core of any successful business
enterprise is the entrepreneurial opportunity that made it possible. Entrepreneurial
opportunities are defined as situations in which “new goods, services, raw materials, and
organizing methods can be introduced and sold at greater than their cost of production”
(Casson, 2000, p. 220). By definition then, opportunities must hold profit potential.
However, the profit potential of an opportunity is a future-oriented judgment, and the
true value can only be known post hoc (Grégoire, Barr, & Shepherd, 2010). This means
that decisions regarding whether or not to act on an opportunity rests on judgments of
whether or not the opportunity appears attractive given one’s resources, knowledge,
skills, and abilities (Haynie et al., 2009; Wood, Williams, & Grégoire, 2012). In that
way, entrepreneurs, investors, and other potential stakeholders must form a consensus
belief that an opportunity for profit does indeed exist and that the opportunity is desirable and feasible for those who will be involved in exploitation (Krueger, 1993; Wood
& McKinley, 2010).
During this process, positive or negative evaluations of desirability and feasibility
may emerge. For example, negative evaluations will lead to doubt that an opportunity
exists (at least for those involved specifically), and thus the opportunity will likely be
abandoned (Shepherd, McMullen, & Jennings, 2007; Wood et al., 2012). If, however,
evaluations are positive, and the opportunity is not only deemed feasible in terms of
the resources required and the ability to generate economic rents, but also desirable in
terms of goals, motivation, and circumstances, then a consensus forms that an attractive
opportunity does indeed exist (Wood & McKinley, 2010). This is important because it
has long been conceptualized that attractive opportunities impel new venture creation.
For example, proponents of “pull entrepreneurship” (Gartner, 1985) and “opportunitybased entrepreneurship” (McMullen, Bagby, & Palich, 2008) have succinctly argued
that some individuals choose entrepreneurship because they identify an opportunity that
is so attractive it simply cannot be passed up. Indeed, a substantial body of decisionmaking research has shown that entrepreneurs and investors are much more likely to
act on highly attractive opportunities than on opportunities that they perceive to hold
less potential (cf. Hall & Hofer, 1993; Mitchell & Shepherd, 2010; Zacharakis &
Meyer, 2000).
While a relationship between opportunity attractiveness and likelihood of investing
is both intuitive and supported by prior research (e.g., Haynie et al., 2009; Mitchell &
Shepherd, 2010; Sorensen & Sorenson, 2003), it is unclear how this relationship is
influenced by other decision criterion, such as perceived control. Considered together, it
seems that VCs would perceive a venture to be more desirable when both the opportunity is attractive and the level of control is high such that risks of moral hazard, holdup,
and other opportunistic behaviors are reduced. In other words, attractive opportunities
are those opportunities that hold strong potential to generate entrepreneurial rents
(Haynie et al.), and when presented by an entrepreneur who is more accepting of VC
control, agency risks are reduced and VCs will deem the deal to be more desirable and
feasible. Overall, we suggest that VCs will be more likely to invest in attractive opportunities in the presence of high perceived control. Formally, our third hypothesis states
the following:
Hypothesis 3: There is an interaction effect between opportunity attractiveness and
perceived control such that as opportunity attractiveness increases, control has a greater
influence on willingness to invest.

<-----Page 7----->Configurations of Prestige, Opportunity Attractiveness, and Control
The previous arguments suggest that VC investment decision making involves a
complex and interrelated set of relationships involving the three broad considerations of
entrepreneurial prestige, opportunity attractiveness, and control. While these factors may
impact willingness to invest both independently and as two-way interactions, to fully
understand the role that these factors play in VC investment decisions, we must consider
these factors collectively. Doing so requires placing a greater emphasis on the configurations perspective.
Configurations theory—typically used to explain organizational differences (e.g.,
Miller & Friesen, 1984)—is an evolution of contingency theory, and argues that taking a
multidimensional view of characteristics or constructs is often preferable and more meaningful than examining them in isolation (Fiss, 2007; Meyer, Tsui, & Hinings, 1993; Short,
Payne, & Ketchen, 2008). In other words, while distinct characteristics may influence a
particular outcome variable, it is likely that some combination of these characteristics “fit”
together in a way that exhibits the greatest influence on a specific outcome (Dess,
Newport, & Rasheed, 1993; Hill & Birkinshaw, 2008). The configuration idea is reflected
in the “garbage can” decision-making model (cf. Mintzberg, 1979) in which the decision
maker sorts and combines decision elements to understand the “unfolding nature of the
linkages between problems and solutions” (March, 1994, p. 206). These linkages may
then form the basis of a story that represents how the particular combination of elements
explains what happened or predict what might happen (March).
One of the main implications of the configurations approach is that “increased effectiveness is attributed to the internal consistency, or fit, among the patterns of relevant
contextual, structural and strategic factors” (Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993, p. 1196). If we
apply this logic to the ambiguous task of predicting new venture outcomes, it is likely that
the decision process can be more completely understood when complex linkages among
these criteria are considered as an optimal or ideal combination rather than independently.
Thus, the optimal combination (or clearly the suboptimal combination in avoidancefocused decisions) of characteristics is likely to dominate the effect of any individual
venture characteristics during the investment decision-making process (Petty & Gruber,
2011). The fundamental proposition is that the level of fit or congruence (Drazin & Van de
Ven, 1985) among the entrepreneur’s prestige, the opportunity’s attractiveness, and perceived control over the entrepreneur’s actions will be associated with the VC’s willingness
to invest in the venture. Specifically, we expect willingness to invest to vary according to
the various combinations of control, prestige, and attractiveness, with the highest level of
willingness to invest coming when all three characteristics are at high levels. Using
configurations language (e.g., Gresov & Drazin, 1997), this prediction suggests an “ideal”
type and is stated formally in the fourth hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4: There is a three-way interaction effect among the entrepreneur’s
prestige, the opportunity’s attractiveness, and perceived control such that willingness
to invest is higher when prestige, attractiveness, and control are all high as opposed to
when the attributes are all low or are in other possible configurations.
While high levels of all three characteristics would theoretically lead to the highest
level of willingness to invest, it is likely that most investment opportunities will not meet
this ideal situation. In particular and as noted previously, there is often an inherent conflict
regarding control between VCs and entrepreneurs (Wasserman, 2008). Such conflict likely
creates situations in which trade-offs or allowances have to be made. Put in terms of our
second hypothesis, situations in which prestige and control are both high are ideal, but
8

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->given resistance from the entrepreneur, a VC may be willing to forgo extensive control if
that entrepreneur is prestigious or if the business opportunity is extremely attractive. The
underlying assumption is that mitigating the threat of agency is not worth missing out on
working with highly prestigious entrepreneurs and/or acting on high-potential opportunities, especially when highly prestigious entrepreneurs voice objections to the VC’s desire
for increased control. In due time, the reality of this trade-off may prove unwise (Williamson, 1988), but during an investment evaluation, it is the perception (perhaps unconscious to the VC) that the trade-off is worth the risk that likely dominates the investment
decision (March, 1994).
Building on the idea that there are substitutes for control, configurations theory
advances the notion of equifinality, which suggests that trade-offs between configurational
characteristics may exist such that different profiles may potentially lead to similar
outcomes. Equifinality among configurational groups serves as the basic argument for the
commonly utilized strategic typologies developed by Miles, Snow, Meyer, and Coleman
(1978), Mintzberg (1979), and Porter (1998), and has been supported empirically (e.g.,
Doty et al., 1993). The equifinal outcomes associated with various configurations have
proven especially insightful in suboptimal contexts (cf. Payne, 2006). The core idea is that
individuals and organizations must consider a complex, and sometimes competing, set of
factors, and these often coalesce in a way that is less than ideal. Hence, configurations
theory suggests that it is useful to consider the functional equivalent outcomes that may
emerge across a range of suboptimal situations.
Applying the configurations logic outlined above to the context of VC investment
decisions suggests that there are a number of suboptimal combinations of prestige,
opportunity attractiveness, and VC control, and at least some of these combinations may
lead to equifinal outcomes. This line of thinking underpins our argument that different
configurations of the investment opportunity attributes will result in relatively equal
levels of investment willingness. In other words, while the decision factor configurations may deviate from the ideal with regard to the level of willingness to invest, this
deviation will result in simultaneous trade-offs among the three characteristics of prestige, opportunity attractiveness, and VC control, and in some cases, these trade-offs will
result in essentially the same level of willingness to invest. Formally, we hypothesize
the following:
Hypothesis 5: Trade-offs exist among the entrepreneur’s prestige, the opportunity’s
attractiveness, and perceived control such that equifinal outcomes (i.e., no discernible
differences in willingness to invest) occur in suboptimal configurations.

Methods
We selected conjoint analysis as our principal methodology. Conjoint analysis and its
associated method, policy capturing, are some of the most widely used tools for analyzing
judgment and decision-making models (Brehmer & Brehmer, 1988; Green & Srinivasan,
1990; Priem, Walters, & Li, 2011). The technique involves asking respondents to make a
series of judgments based on theory-driven profiles provided by the researcher (AimanSmith, Scullen, & Barr, 2002; Hitt, Ahlstrom, Dacin, Levitas, & Svobodina, 2004; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 1997). The advantage of this approach is that it overcomes many of the
limitations associated with post hoc techniques that require introspection about decisions
made in the past (Aiman-Smith et al.). However, a notable limitation of the conjoint
approach is the potential for a low level of external validity (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson,
January, 2013

9

<-----Page 9----->& Tatham, 2006). We sought to overcome this external validity challenge by following the
traditions established in well-regarded conjoint studies by modeling factors that have been
shown to be important to VCs and by using experienced participants from the population for which we wish to generalize our findings (Green & Srinivasan; Shepherd &
Zacharakis). Additionally, we conducted interviews with a number of VCs to further
augment the validity and relevance of our findings; the insights gleaned from those
interviews supplement the discussion of our findings.

Sample
We solicited experienced VCs to participate in our conjoint experiment. Because VCs
often specialize in different types of funding stages and because our study is focused on
understanding early stage funding decisions, we identified a group of VCs that primarily
execute early stage funding deals. These individuals were listed in a leading VC association directory in the United States. We e-mailed initial participation invitations to 280
active VCs from this list and offered a $20 incentive to encourage participation. Following
the guidance of Dillman (2000), our initial request was followed by two reminder requests
sent at 1-week intervals. A total of 69 VCs (25% response rate) responded to our requests
and completed the experiment. Our sample size is in line with those of other published
VC decision-making conjoint studies (Franke, Gruber, Harhoff, & Henkel, 2006; Franke
et al., 2008; Murnieks et al., 2011; Shepherd, Zacharakis, & Baron, 2003), and like these
studies, our unit of analysis is the decision. Because participants completed eight decisions each, the relevant sample consists of 552 decisions.
Of the 69 VC participants, 24 accepted the $20 incentive while the remainder
declined. To ensure the incentive did not introduce a bias, we compared age, education,
and years of VC experience between those who accepted the incentive and those who did
not, and we found no significant differences. In terms of gender and age, our participants
included 7 females and 62 males ranging in age from 25 to 79, with a mean age of 49.72.
In terms of education, 9 participants had some college, 45 had earned a bachelor’s degree,
and 15 had earned a master’s degree. Each participant verified that he or she was an active
VC, but they had varied levels of experience: 14 indicated 1–5 years, 13 indicated 6–10
years, 21 indicated 11–15 years, and 21 indicated 16 or more years of experience in the
VC industry. These characteristics indicate that our participants were quite experienced at
evaluating VC investment deals, and thus comprise an appropriate sample for our study
(Brehmer & Brehmer, 1988).

Instrument
Our instrument design followed a number of published conjoint studies (AimanSmith et al., 2002; Choi & Shepherd, 2004; Haynie et al., 2009; Shepherd & Zacharakis,
1997). The instrument was presented via a web-based interactive process, and consisted
of instructions for completing the experiment, descriptions of the variables, a series of
conjoint profiles, and a post-experiment questionnaire. In the experiment portion of the
instrument, VCs were asked to evaluate a series of hypothetical venture deal profiles, each
of which described a different configuration of control, prestige, and attractiveness (see
Table 1). After each scenario, subjects were asked to indicate their willingness to invest,
amount of investment, and terms of investment given the deal attributes presented in the
profile. Responses were captured using 7-point Likert scales.
In designing the profiles, we used an orthogonal full factorial design with two levels
of control, two levels of prestige, and two levels of attractiveness (2 control ¥ 2 prestige ¥
10

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 10----->2 attractiveness), which resulted in eight full profile descriptions. In the orthogonal
approach, variable intercorrelations are zero, so multicollinearity is not an issue (Huber,
1987). In addition to the eight profiles, participants also received one “warm-up” profile
that was excluded from the data analysis and three repeat profiles included as reliability
checks. Profile presentation was randomized to reduce the probability of order effects
(Hair et al., 2006). Additionally, profiles were presented on a separate screen, and participants were not allowed to refer back to any of the previous profiles.
We continued to follow the lead of other entrepreneurship-focused conjoint studies,
and developed instructions and background scenario information (e.g., Haynie et al.,
2009; Murnieks et al., 2011). Thus, before evaluating the profiles, participants were
instructed that they would be asked to make a series of decisions regarding how likely they
would be to invest in the launch of a new venture based on the industry attributes described
in each profile. They were also told that when making these decisions, they were to put
themselves in the context of each investment scenario, answering questions as if they were
in the situation. Additionally, they were told to assume that the venture falls within their
deal strategy and that they had the financial resources available to invest in the new
venture if they chose to do so. Finally, participants were informed that each profile should
be considered as a separate decision independent of all the others and that they would
not be able to return to profiles they already completed.
Following the experiment instructions, a definition screen introduced participants to a
fictional firm (i.e., WPI) via the following statement: “WPI is an early stage venture and
is currently seeking funding. The company is based on the introduction of a new process
technology. The WPI attributes presented in the simulation are related to the founder and
the opportunity; these attributes are clearly defined for you.”2 This language was followed
by the specific attributes and definitions for each level of the attribute. Attribute and level
descriptions as presented to participants are provided in Appendix 1. The full instrument
was reviewed by select VCs who made some suggestions for improvement. After revisions, the instrument was pilot-tested using a select group of graduate students. The results
of the pilot indicated that the instrument effectively tapped into decision policies associated with new venture investment.

Variables
Dependent Variable. The dependent variable was VCs’ willingness to invest in the
venture. Most conjoint studies use a single-item scale to measure the dependent variable
(Haynie et al., 2009; Wood & Pearson, 2009; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1998). However,
recent studies have moved toward increasing reliability (Kerlinger & Lee, 2000) by
employing multi-item scales. In that spirit, we adopted Murnieks et al.’s (2011) approach
and measured the dependent variable using a 3-item scale. Specifically, we asked participants to indicate the probability they would invest (1 = low to 7 = high), the amount they
would be willing to invest (1 = lowest possible amount to 7 = highest possible amount),
and the terms of investment they would likely offer (1 = worst possible terms to 7 = best
possible terms). We selected metric rating scales because they capture gradation in
investment attractiveness and allow for the investigation of interactive relationships

2. This description of the target company is in line with other VC conjoint studies (cf. Murnieks et al., 2011)
that provide very little information (if any) on the venture beyond profile attributes. This is intentional because
such information is likely to influence responses and confound attribute effects.

January, 2013

<-----Page 11----->(Hitt & Barr, 1989). The scale proved reliable (Cronbach’s alpha = .89), and we summed
the three scores to form an overall measure of willingness to invest.
Independent Variables. Each venture attribute profile was described in terms of the
following three independent variables: perceived control (two levels), entrepreneurial
prestige (two levels), and opportunity attractiveness (two levels). As previously discussed,
we chose these variables (and not others) because of their assumed theoretical and
demonstrated empirical importance in new venture investment evaluations (Franke et al.,
2008; Mitchell & Shepherd, 2010; Payne et al., 2009), and we chose the levels of each
variable based on variations typically found in VC investment environments. We constructed our eight profiles by varying the levels of each of these attributes until all possible
configurations were included.
Control Variables. Prior research shows that experience matters when it comes to evaluating opportunities (Baron & Ensley, 2006; Haynie et al., 2009; Mitchell & Shepherd,
2010). Thus, our post-experiment questionnaire captured experience-related information
to be included as control variables in our analysis. Specifically, participant education, age,
and years of experience in the VC industry were employed as controls.

Empirical Model
Because each VC participated in a series of judgments, each judgment may not be
entirely independent, so there may be autocorrelation issues. Therefore, an analytic
technique designed for repeated measures (i.e., controls for autocorrelation) is required.
Moreover, our data are mixed because we asked participants to evaluate a series of profiles
(within subject), and we then collected information on demographic variables (between
subjects). Both Field (2005) and Hair et al. (2006) suggest that mixed-model, repeatedmeasure analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an appropriate analytic technique that fits well
with our data structure. In addition, the advantage of the ANOVA approach over other
possible techniques (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling) is that it provides a detailed set of
estimated marginal means for all possible variable combinations. These mean values are
required to untangle the complex interactions, configurations, and trade-offs that we
hypothesize, so we selected the ANOVA approach. Following the procedures outlined by
Field and utilized in other entrepreneurship conjoint studies (Wood & Pearson, 2009), we
entered the various levels of the independent variables (i.e., control, prestige, and attractiveness) as within-subject factors. All of the values for the control variables (i.e., age,
education, and VC experience) were entered as between-subject factors, and the summated values from the willingness to invest scale were entered as the dependent variable.
Before conducting the data analysis outlined above, we needed to ensure that the
experiment was completed reliably. For this purpose, we asked two questions, one inquiring if the participants had understood the instructions for the experiment and a
second inquiring whether they had fully understood the definitions of the terms. All 69
VCs indicated assent to these two questions. Next, as a statistical test of reliability, we
examined differences in VCs’ responses to the original vs. repeat conjoint profiles. The
idea was that if participants completed the experiment in a reliable manner, there should
be no significant difference between responses (Green & Srinivasan, 1978; Hair et al.,
2006). The means for the willingness to invest question were compared across the three
original profiles vs. the three repeat profiles. Means were 1.35 vs. 1.38, 6.04 vs. 6.01, and
1.84 vs. 2.01. All three of these differences failed to reach statistical significance
(T = 0.03, p = 0.98; T = 0.43, p = 0.67; T = 1.62, p = 0.11, respectively). These findings

proceed with hypothesis testing.

Results
The experiment provided a total of 552 decisions as the result of each participant
analyzing eight profiles. When analyzed at the aggregate level, we found a number of
significant effects. Table 1 reports the estimated marginal population mean for each
level of the variable (or interaction term), and Table 2 reports the results of our ANOVA
analyses. In addition to these results, we also calculated and report below full eta-square
values (h2) for each main and interaction effect as an indicator of the amount of variance
in the dependent variable explained by changes in the independent variable or interaction
term (Hair et al., 2006; Levine & Hullett, 2002). Full eta-squared (aka classic eta-squared)
is an “additive measure of unique variation in the dependent variable that can not be
accounted for by other factors in the analysis” (Pierce, Block, & Aguinis, 2004, p. 919),
and thus indicates the amount of variance attributable to each factor or interaction over
and above that accounted for by other factors or interaction terms in the model.
As illustrated in Table 2, all three of the main effects were significant. The estimated
marginal means in Table 1 revealed that as entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity
attractiveness each moved from low to high, VCs were more willing to invest. These
results were expected, and prior empirical research suggested that VCs would be more
likely to invest in deals involving highly prestigious entrepreneurs, and our results provide

further support for this assertion, F(1,4) = 132.18, p < .001, h2 = .33. Similarly, prior
research suggests that VCs should be more willing to consider ventures based on
highly attractive opportunities, and while not hypothesized, our results are consistent with
extant research, F(1,4) = 158.67, p < .001, h2 = .34. In sum, our findings further validate
the findings in the literature for the effects of entrepreneur prestige and opportunity
attractiveness.
In contrast to the previously established relationships among prestige, attractiveness,
and investment likelihood, we developed an argument and hypothesized that perceived
control would be positively related to VCs’ willingness to invest in ventures. Our repeatedmeasure ANOVA results revealed a significant main effect for control, F(1,4) = 36.01,
p < .01, h2 = .13, and the estimated marginal means (Table 1) revealed that willingness to
invest was substantially greater when control was high (M = 11.55) than when it was low
(M = 8.97). These results provide strong support for hypothesis 1. It is worth noting that
the F-values and N-square statistics reported above are indicators of effect size, so the
importance of the variables explored can be determined. Thus, the decision making of
our sample of VCs reveals that opportunity attractiveness was the most important factor,
followed by the entrepreneur’s prestige and then by perceived control.
Hypothesis 2 suggested that control interacts with entrepreneurial prestige in a reinforcing manner. Our analyses revealed a significant interaction effect between prestige
and control, F(2,4) = 8.701, p < .05, h2 = .012, and estimated marginal means (Table 1)
showed that willingness to invest was substantially greater when prestige and control were
both high (M = 13.79) than when they were both low (M = 6.94). To better understand this
interaction, we followed the widely adopted recommendations and techniques suggested
by Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003), and graphed the interaction terms (see
Figure 1). Viewing the graph in conjunction with the estimated marginal means used
to construct it (Table 1), we see that when considered alone, the effect of prestige on
willingness to invest had a low condition mean of 8.13 and a high condition mean of
12.37, but in the presence of low control, the means became 6.94 and 11.01, respectively.
In the presence of high control, the means became 9.31 and 13.79, respectively. This

indicates that the negative perceptions of low prestige as indicated by VCs’ willingness to
invest were reinforced by low control but mitigated by high control. Similarly, the positive
perceptions of high prestige were mitigated by low control and reinforced by high control.
Thus, VCs were the least willing to invest when prestige and control were both low,
and the most willing to invest when prestige and control were both high. These findings
provide strong support for hypothesis 2.
Hypothesis 3 was based on the idea that control may interact with opportunity
attractiveness in a reinforcing manner. Our analyses revealed a significant interaction
effect between attractiveness and control, F(2,4) = 15.582, p < .05, h2 = .021, and estimated marginal means (Table 1) revealed that willingness to invest was substantially
greater when attractiveness and control were both high (M = 14.66) than when they were
both low (M = 7.07). To better understand this interaction, we graphed the interaction
terms in Figure 2. Viewing the graph in conjunction with the estimated marginal means
(Table 1), we see that when considered alone, the effect of attractiveness resulted in a
mean investment value of 7.76 when attractiveness was low and a high condition mean
of 12.71. However, in the presence of low control, the means became 7.07 and 10.88,
respectively. In the presence of high control, the means became 8.45 and 14.66,

respectively. This indicates that the negative perceptions of low opportunity attractiveness
were reinforced by low control but mitigated by high control. Similarly, the positive
perceptions of high attractiveness were mitigated by low control and reinforced by high
control. Thus, VCs were the least willing to invest when opportunity attractiveness and
control were both low, and the most willing to invest when attractiveness and control were
both high. These results support hypothesis 3.
Hypothesis 4 argued that a three-way configuration among control, opportunity attractiveness, and prestige exists such that the greatest likelihood of investment comes in play
under conditions in which all three characteristics are high. Our analysis demonstrated
a significant three-way interaction effect, F(1,9) = 4.841, p < .05, h2 = .017, To better
understand the nature of this effect, we examined the estimated marginal means (Table 1)
and constructed two interaction graphs (Figure 3a and b). The table and the graphs
revealed that willingness to invest was lowest when control, prestige, and attractiveness
were all low (M = 5.40). By contrast, willingness to invest was highest when control,
prestige, and attractiveness were all high (M = 16.99). In the middle range, a high level of
prestige and attractiveness were preferred, but that effect was strengthened in the presence
of high control. These findings indicate that the ideal configuration included conditions in
which control, prestige, and attractiveness were all at high levels as opposed to any other
configuration of these variables. The results also indicate that the optimal configuration
resulted in a much higher likelihood of VC investment than when any one of the decision
characteristics was considered alone (e.g., high opportunity attractiveness resulted in a
16

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->mean investment of 12.76 vs. the three-variable optimal configuration mean investment of
16.99). These results provide strong support for hypothesis 4 and the configurations logic
that underpins the hypothesized relationship.
Hypothesis 5 argued that trade-offs exist between characteristics such that suboptimal
(i.e., less than ideal) configurations might have equifinal outcomes. The means of the
three-way interactions in Table 1 demonstrated some support for this hypothesis as a
number of relative trade-offs between characteristics emerged. The characteristics that
resulted in the most equifinal outcome were the trade-off between the entrepreneur’s
prestige and the opportunity’s attractiveness. Specifically, when control was low, a relatively equal likelihood of investment existed contingent upon either a highly prestigious
entrepreneur or an attractive opportunity (8.69 and 8.95). While not as equal in outcome,
a trade-off between the two surfaced when control was high. Here, we see that when
perceived control was high, the addition of either an attractive opportunity or a prestigious
entrepreneur can create a relatively similar outcome (10.83 and 12.37, respectively).
Perhaps the most interesting trade-off occurred between control and entrepreneurial
prestige, for which low levels of prestige were accounted for by high levels of control and
vice versa. See, for instance, the configurations with means of 12.37 and 13.45. In sum,
these findings show that even when perceived control was high, the presence of a less
prestigious entrepreneur and an unattractive opportunity resulted in very low willingness
to invest (6.38). However, when either prestige or the opportunity became favorable,
control acted in a reinforcing manner where the addition of another favorable characteristic considerably increased investment likelihood. To be clear, we are not arguing that the
trade-offs and outcomes discussed above were statistically equivalent, but rather that they
were practically similar in terms of VCs’ likelihood to invest.

Post Hoc Analysis
Although not hypothesized, we also considered the idea that preference for certain
investment deal attributes (e.g., control) may vary as a function of individual differences
(e.g., age). To investigate this, we conducted a brief post hoc analysis investigating VC age
as a differentiating factor. To do this, we split the sample using the mean age (49.72 years
of age) as a cutoff threshold. We then ran the main effects for the independent variables
across the two groups. We found that younger VCs placed less emphasis on control,
F(1,34) = 34.88, p < .05, than older VCs did, F(1,33) = 56.05, p < .05. Further, our analysis revealed that when holding all else constant, younger VCs placed the most emphasis
on the entrepreneur’s prestige, F(1,34) = 124.63 p < .05, while older VCs placed the most
emphasis on opportunity attractiveness, F(1,33) = 122.53, p < .05. While exploratory,
these findings suggest that there may be important differences between younger and older
VCs. This supports our inclusion of age as a control variable in the analyses reported
above. However, more importantly, these findings suggest a need for further research
investigating the influence of individual-level variables on VC investment analysis and
configurational decision making.

Discussion
Through this study, we demonstrate the importance of control in the VC investment
decision-making process. Our primary results suggest, ceteris paribus, that perceptions
of control influence VCs’ willingness to invest in opportunities. Generally, VCs utilize
January, 2013

17

<-----Page 17----->several types of control mechanisms as a means of reducing uncertainty and mitigating
risk (Bonini et al., 2012). However, little evidence exists as to what extent these control
mechanisms influence initial investment decisions. Wiltbank, Read, Dew, and Sarasvathy (2009) offer some insight here as their study of angel investors demonstrates
that investors who emphasize control experience less investment failures but realize
fewer large success events. Our results add to Wiltbank et al.’s work as we find that the
degree of perceived control does indeed influence VCs’ initial investment decisions, and
like angel investors, VCs emphasize control in efforts to reduce downside risk while
allowing for upside potential. However, an interesting question emerges: to what degree
does a focus on control reduce a venture’s upside potential? It may be that very stringent control mechanisms restrict entrepreneurs in a way that they are unable to fully
enact (Wood & McKinley, 2010) or optimally exploit (Shane, 2003) an opportunity.
Therefore, extremely high levels of control may reduce a venture’s ability to maximize
return on investment. Investigating this question is clearly an opportunity for future
research.
Because we find a direct positive relationship between control and VCs’ willingness
to invest in ventures, it suggests that investment decisions may hinge on the extent to
which investors believe entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial teams are amenable to various control measures designed to mitigate potential agency problems. However, when
considered independently, this issue appears to be less influential than the entrepreneur’s
prestige or the opportunity’s attractiveness. In that way, controlling the entrepreneur’s actions does not appear to be the VC’s first concern. If we view this from a nexus
perspective (e.g., Shane, 2003), these findings seem logical because without an attractive
opportunity and a capable entrepreneur, venture investment is so unlikely that perceived
control becomes largely irrelevant. Thus, in the absence of an attractive opportunity and
a prestigious entrepreneur, control is likely to play only a minor role. This may help
explain why some studies have not found a significant relationship between VC control
and level of investment (e.g., Payne et al., 2009).
Although finding a direct relationship between control and willingness to invest is
important, our findings suggest that it is how control interacts with other major decision
criteria that provides the best explanation of VC investment decision-making outcomes.
Specifically, our results show that control interacts with both the entrepreneur’s prestige
and the opportunity’s attractiveness to influence willingness to invest. These findings
are seemingly rational as investing in a highly prestigious entrepreneur or a prosperous
opportunity with minimal control heightens the threat of agency risks and may provide
an avenue for self-interest seeking (Williamson, 1988). As such, a lack of control over
information sharing and the entrepreneur’s actions would likely render a deal with a
prestigious entrepreneur or an entrepreneur pursuing a highly promising opportunity less
desirable. Correspondingly, high levels of perceived control appear to bolster the positive
effect of entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity attractiveness. The implication then is
that VCs become focused on control when other characteristics are favorable and are more
likely to invest in a deal under these conditions when control is high. Establishing the
moderating effect of control in the presence of entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity
attractiveness contributes to the delineation of boundary conditions (Dubin, 1978) around
these more readily established variables.
More telling, perhaps, than the two-way interactions are the results surrounding the
three-way interaction, which tests a configurations perspective (Miller & Friesen, 1984;
Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005) of VC decision making. Specifically, we find that an optimal
configuration is achieved when the entrepreneur’s prestige, the opportunity’s attractiveness, and the degree of perceived control are high. It is under these conditions that VCs
18

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 18----->express the greatest willingness to invest in the venture. Moreover, while VCs would
naturally be more willing to allocate financial resources toward an attractive opportunity
being pursued by prestigious entrepreneurs who are amenable to VC control, we move
beyond this ideal configuration to better understand the more complex trade-offs that
occur when one or more of the characteristics are not at an optimal level. Leveraging a
central tenet of the configurations perspective (i.e., equifinality), we explore circumstances for which trade-offs between the different characteristics under study may result
in similar outcomes or willingness to invest.
In further exploring such equifinal outcomes among prestige, opportunity attractiveness, and control, we note a number of interesting findings. First, in the presence
of an attractive opportunity, we find that VC control may serve as a substitute for the
entrepreneur’s prestige. In other words, if an entrepreneur lacks experience and affiliations, it appears that high levels of VC control can counteract this absence, whereas
VCs appear to be willing to forego stringent control when considering an experienced,
well-connected entrepreneur. As noted in the Results section, the estimated marginal
means indicate a similar level of willingness to invest in situations with high control
and low prestige and vice versa. What this suggests is that because the opportunity’s
attractiveness is the most important decision factor, as long as there is a highly attractive
opportunity, VCs are willing to accept either a highly prestigious entrepreneur or a
high degree of control. While our results indicate that high levels of both prestige and
control are ideal, it appears that high levels of prestige or control may suffice. Clearly,
our methods and data do not tap into the underlying reason for this, but we speculate that VCs assume that prestigious entrepreneurs are equipped with high levels of
experience and knowledge that substitute for control. In contrast, less prestigious entrepreneurs lack a track record that makes agency concerns central, so VCs must have
strong control mechanisms in place to ensure lesser known entrepreneurs take proper
actions.
Next, our analysis also revealed a trade-off between the entrepreneur’s prestige and
the opportunity’s attractiveness. In one instance—when control is low—VCs have similar
willingness to invest when either the opportunity’s attractiveness is high or when the
entrepreneur’s prestige is high. In another instance—when control is high—either an
attractive opportunity or a highly prestigious entrepreneur results in a relatively similar
investment probability. Thus, both cases depict trade-off scenarios that engender similar
outcomes. It is also worth noting that the reinforcing effect of high control is further
illustrated in the opportunity–prestige trade-off as the willingness to invest is considerably
higher for the configurations accompanied by high levels of control. In that vein, our
findings suggest that it is not a single evaluative factor (e.g., opportunity, entrepreneur, or
control) but instead a nexus of factors that come together in a way that reduces VCs’
uncertainty, and thus makes investment more likely. Thus, our findings provide further
evidence suggesting that more research is needed to examine why some trade-off configurations are favorable while others are not.
Finally, our post hoc analysis using VC age as a grouping variable has implications for
future VC research that builds on our findings. Specifically, we found that younger VCs
placed less emphasis on control than older VCs. This finding was further validated in one
of the post hoc interviews we conducted, in which a practicing VC asserted, “After doing
this since 1981, if the investor group does not have control, I’ll pass.” While we do not
have detailed data regarding this phenomenon, we speculate that the experience and
patience that come with age result in a greater emphasis on the need to control entrepreneurs’ actions. Clearly, our study was not designed to investigate the effects of VC-centric
characteristics, but because our study provides clear evidence that control is influential in
January, 2013

19

<-----Page 19----->the VC decision-making process and because it identifies some of the conditions under
which control is more or less important, we provide a platform whereby researchers can
further investigate the effects of individual differences alongside variables like control.
Our data suggest that such effects exist, and we look forward to joining others in exploring
these dynamics.

Implications for Practice
Our study provides a number of practical insights for entrepreneurs, VCs, and other
parties interested in venture funding decisions. First, our study reinforces prior research
showing that opportunity quality and entrepreneurs’ reputational characteristics are
essential considerations in VC investment decisions. As such, entrepreneurs should
recognize that VC funding is unlikely if they cannot demonstrate that an opportunity
being pursued is of high potential, and that they have the requisite skills, abilities, and
track record to turn the opportunity into a high-performing venture. Along with
this understanding, those seeking funding should also be cognizant of the important role
that control plays in the preinvestment context. Because each VC investment entails
considerable agency risk, securing control is largely a mechanism by which VCs can
protect their own best interest and the interest of their limited partners. Thus, resistance
to control will likely have an adverse impact on entrepreneurs’ ability to secure funding. Moreover, the observed trade-off between prestige and control indicates that
unknown or less prestigious entrepreneurs should give particular consideration to their
willingness to accept measures of control. Accordingly, those seeking VC funding
should consider the degree to which they are willing to accept control mechanisms,
and those more accepting of such controls may do well to communicate that to potential
VC investors.
With respect to VCs, these findings bring to light how key evaluative factors are
weighted by a host of VCs across the venture community. The results of our study provide
a baseline with which VCs can benchmark their own evaluation process. Additionally,
this study provides insight into aspects of control for practicing VCs. In certain cases,
perceived control was shown to rival the importance of other more readily established
evaluative factors. Such an emphasis is rightfully merited as the implications of disregarding control prior to investment can have costly implications. Highlighting this point,
one VC in our interviews asserted, “[Because of minimal control,] I was stuck in a deal for
over a decade until the entrepreneur/founder got pushed out.” In a similar vein, another
VC noted, “You have an entrepreneur in the driver seat. . . . You say time to sell, he says
‘I like the corner office,’ and you don’t have control.” Collectively, our research underscores the importance for VCs to evaluate perceived control in the preinvestment context
as partnering with an entrepreneur who resists such control may lead to, among other
outcomes, an inability to provide a timely return.

Limitations
The conjoint method utilized in this study overcomes several problems identified in
previous studies (e.g., post hoc bias), but it does carry its own set of limitations that must
be considered. Primarily, the validity of the results may be called into question due to the
oversimplification of the study (Heckman & Smith, 1995). In other words, the situation
presented by the researcher to the VC in a conjoint study is considerably less complicated
than reality in terms of the task and the context. However, removing the specifics of a
20

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 20----->situation may help determine basic relationships, thereby effectively removing biases. For
example, Franke et al. (2006) demonstrated that VC evaluations may be systematically
distorted because of similarities between the VC and the entrepreneurial team in terms of
age, education, field of training, professional background, and experience. Further, our
approach in the current study may be preferable to related studies that ask respondents to
retrospectively review investment decisions. Payne et al. (2009, p. 171), for instance, state
that “a possible limitation inherent in [their] study is the potential survivor bias that comes
with requesting information from the VC on their most recent venture investments.” Our
approach removes the survivor bias problem.
A second limitation is that our sample of VC participants was all based in the United
States. While we believe our findings are applicable in other developed regions, we must
generalize our findings conservatively. Given the substantial differences in social structures, laws and policy, and cultural norms across nations, additional research is needed
involving VC participants in other contexts. In particular, legal systems may play a key
role in VC investment decisions because there is wide variation across nations with
regard to property right protection; patent protection; and the legal rights afforded to labor,
creditors, and customers (Alhorr, Moore, & Payne, 2008; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,
Shleifer, & Vishny, 1998). Invariably, such factors play an important role in an entrepreneur’s evaluation of an opportunity’s attractiveness and may limit the type of arrangements that VCs will accept.
A final limitation of our study is that we only consider three venture characteristics
in our model. It is likely that other characteristics play a role in VCs’ decision-making
process. For example, prior research suggests that the geographic location of the
venture and investors (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001), specific characteristics of the intended
market (Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984), entrepreneurial traits beyond prestige (Hsu, 2007;
Macmillan, Siegel, & Narasimha, 1985), and the strength of the presentation (Chen
et al., 2009) may also impact VCs’ willingness to invest. Further, recent trends in the
emergence of entrepreneurial opportunities suggest that social considerations, such as
the strength of network ties (Wood & McKinley, 2010), the ability to use resources
at hand (Baker & Nelson, 2005), and early planning (Dimov, 2010), are important
processes that make venture emergence possible. In this vein, it is possible that social
considerations, such as network ties, may moderate the effects of venture and entrepreneurial characteristics on VCs’ willingness to invest. Thus, more research is needed
to flush out important social processes and to understand how those processes impact
VC decision making.

Conclusion
It is readily understood that control is a critical component of the ongoing
VC–entrepreneur dyad (Gompers & Lerner, 2004; Hellmann, 1998; Kaplan & Strömberg,
2003, 2004). Our research goes a step beyond this established understanding by systematically exploring the role that perceived control plays in the preinvestment context of
new venture evaluation. Our findings provided strong empirical support for a number
of hypotheses suggesting that (1) control does indeed play a key role in early stage
VC decision making and (2) control becomes more important when simultaneously
considered with other factors—specifically entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity
attractiveness—when initial investment decisions are made. Distinctively, we find that
taking a configurational view of the venture can more completely explain VCs’ willingness to invest.

<-----Page 21----->Appendix 1
Attributes and Level Descriptions Presented to Participants
Characteristics of the Entrepreneur
Entrepreneurial Prestige—Superior: The entrepreneur is well known for having
been involved in a number of successful ventures and is affiliated with a large number of
very successful business leaders.
Entrepreneurial Prestige—Minimal: The entrepreneur is not well known for his
involvement in prior entrepreneurial ventures and is affiliated with very few successful
business leaders.

Characteristics of the Opportunity
Opportunity Attractiveness—Proven: WPI is based on a business opportunity that
has been proven desirable and feasible because it dramatically improves product quality
and dramatically reduces production costs. It is expected that the business opportunity will
quickly generate cash flows.
Opportunity Attractiveness—Developing: WPI is based on a business opportunity
that is believed to be desirable and feasible because it slightly improves product quality
and slightly reduces production costs. It is expected that the business opportunity will
slowly generate cash flows.

Characteristics of Thought Processes
Perceived Control—Complete: WPI’s founding entrepreneur will be easy to control
because of the willingness to sign contracts, giving investors the ability to modify the
management team and use staged funding to ensure that performance targets are met.
Perceived Control—Limited: WPI’s founding entrepreneur will be difficult to control
because of an unwillingness to sign contracts that would give investors the ability to modify
the management team and use staged funding to ensure that performance targets are met.

Appendix 2
Sample Investment Scenario
This investment opportunity is characterized as follows:
