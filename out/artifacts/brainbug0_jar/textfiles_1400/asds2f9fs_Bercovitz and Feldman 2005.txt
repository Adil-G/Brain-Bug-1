Development

ABSTRACT. This paper oﬀers a framework to illuminate the
role of universities in systems of innovation. The framework
attempts to incorporate economic, social, and political inﬂuences that aﬀect the ability of universities to both create new
knowledge and deploy that knowledge in economically useful
ways and thereby contribute to economic growth and prosperity. The objective of this paper is to build a more general
understanding of university–industry relationships and their
role in knowledge-based innovation systems.
Key words: universities, entrepreneurship, technology transfer,
economy development, knowledge base.

1. Introduction
Universities ﬁgure prominently in any discussion
of the production, diﬀusion, and deployment of
knowledge and innovation that supports economic
growth. While universities have long served as a
source of technological advances for industry,
university–industry collaboration has intensiﬁed in
recent years due to four interrelated factors: the
development of new, high-opportunity technology
platforms such as computer science, molecular
biology and material science; the more general

growing scientiﬁc and technical content of all types
of industrial production; the need for new sources
of academic research funding created by budgetary
stringency; and the prominence of government
policies aimed at raising the economic returns of
publicly funded research by stimulating university
technology-transfer (Geuna, 1998, pp. 5–6).
Etzkowitz (1983) has coined the phrase entrepreneurial universities to describe the series of changes
that reﬂect the more active role universities have
taken in promoting direct and active transfer of
academic research.1 However, technology-transfer
is challenging as private ﬁrms and research universities have profoundly diﬀerent missions and
often display mutual distrust (Slaughter and
Leslie, 1997). While universities are often regarded
as holding important assets that could be leveraged for economic development, the presence of a
local university may be necessary, but not
suﬃcient, to guarantee that knowledge-based
economic development takes place.
The intention of this paper is to oﬀer a framework that may be used to illuminate the role of
universities in the study of innovation. Economic
development benchmarking relies on a variety of
metrics that may be regarded as either inputs to
innovation or outcomes. This view tends to ignore
the process of transferring technology and the
factors that condition its success. The framework
proposed here examines the black box of university technology-transfer and considers the motivations and incentives provided to the various
actors. These, in turn, are aﬀected by economic,
social, and political inﬂuences that shape the
ability of universities to both create new

knowledge and deploy that knowledge in ways
that are economically useful to ﬁrms. Thus, we
identify and examine points of inﬂuence and speciﬁc factors that enhance or inhibit the creation
and transfer of academic science.
Labor mobility is obviously one mechanism of
knowledge spillovers and a growing literature
documents the importance of social interaction,
local networks, and personal communication in
knowledge transmission. Yet individual agents
work within organizations and institutions that
are deﬁned by routines, norms and standard
operating procedures. The ways in which social
interaction is initiated, the governance and evolution of working relationships, and ultimately,
the eﬃciency with which knowledge is absorbed
and put into economic use are a function of this
context.
The next section of this paper presents a conceptual framework to model the role of universities
in systems of innovation. The elements of this
framework are developed and discussed in turn.
The ﬁnal section concludes with policy recommendations.

2. Conceptual model
The commercialization of university research, at
its simplest, is a dyad involving transactions
between the university and a commercial ﬁrm.
Commercializing a technology may encompass
many diﬀerent types of transactions between a
university and the company and diﬀerent types of
transactions may occur sequentially to reinforce
commercialization. Ultimately, a relationship may
develop that furthers the interests and goals of
each party. Universities themselves are complex
bureaucracies with their own rules, rewards and
incentive structures. Moreover, in contrast to
commercial ﬁrms with a relatively simple proﬁt
motive, universities have complex objective functions that involve a variety of educational and
societal objectives as well as the interests of faculty
members and the larger scientiﬁc community.
Figure 1 provides the conceptual framework
that guides our analysis of university–industry
relationships. Universities’ relationships with
industry are formed through a series of sequential
transactions such as sponsored research, licenses,

<-----Page 2----->Entpreprenerial Universities and Technology Transfer

spin-oﬀ ﬁrms and the hiring of students. Scholars
have tended to analyze formal mechanisms such as
sponsored research agreements, licenses, or equity
swaps (see, for example, Mowery and Ziedonis,
1999; Siegel et al., 1999; Feldman et al., 2002;
Thursby and Kemp, 2002) when investigating
technology transfer. While enlightening, this focus
is narrow as ﬁrm–industry interactions combine
formal and informal interactions and are inﬂuenced by ﬁrm strategy and industry characteristics,
university policies as well as the structure of the
technology transfer operations and the parameters
deﬁned by government policy.
Transactions as transfer mechanisms
The core elements in university–industry relationships are transactions that occur through the
mechanisms of sponsored research support
(including participation and sponsorship of
research centers), agreements to license university
intellectual property, the hiring of research students, and new start-up ﬁrms. To be inclusive,
serendipity is also included as an informal mechanism that might be used to initiate a relationship,
which subsequently develops through other
mechanisms. Each of these mechanisms is brieﬂy
described in Table I.
Sponsored research is deﬁned as a contract
between the academic entity and the ﬁrm. A
sponsored research project supports research
commissioned through the university and provides
resources for infrastructure, graduate students,
course releases and summer support for faculty
members. In this way, sponsored research is an
important input to the technology transfer process. The majority of sponsored research is funded
by government agencies. The amount of industry
support varies signiﬁcantly between countries.

177

Sponsored research may also involve company
participation in an industry-funded research center
and consortium. Moreover, individual ﬁrms make
strategic decisions to sponsor university research
which aﬀects the types of alliances they form with
universities and the attributes they are looking for
in a university partner (Bercovitz and Feldman,
2005). The conventional wisdom, in general, is that
government funding is more basic and less
restricted while industry funding is more focused
and later stage.
The ability of the university scientist to engage
in sponsored research as well as the incentives,
behavioral norms, and conﬁgurations of the relationship are part and parcel of an innovation
system and aﬀect both resources available to
scientists and the types of problems considered.
Sponsored research may take the form of grants or
contracts. Grants are more open ended in terms of
outcomes, while contracts typically enumerate a
set of speciﬁc deliverable products and explicit end
results. Contracts typically entail closer working
relationships with industry, and both parties
negotiate the legal speciﬁcations of the contract
and the ownership of the resulting intellectual
property. The sponsored research agreement may
specify the ownership of any resulting intellectual
property and may also provide details for licensing
of potential patents, divisions of royalties, and
future sponsored projects. The characteristics of
individual companies also aﬀect the choice and
speciﬁcation of the sponsored research transaction. For example, Cohen et al. (1992) found that
industry–university research center participation
was favored for engineering technologies, while
biomedical companies are more likely to support
sponsored research projects. From the perspective
of companies, sponsoring research projects also
provides a mechanism to inﬂuence the training of

advanced students while also observing and
screening the students for potential future
employment.
Consulting agreements with individual faculty
are outside the university technology transfer
purview, and the company that pays the faculty
member for his time typically owns any intellectual
property created. In this way, the university does
not have any rights to the intellectual property and
loses the potential funding source. To the extent
that legal and institutional constraints favor consulting instead of sponsoring university research,
the position of universities may be diminished. The
university may reserve the right to review research
agreements done through faculty consulting or
may monitor the amount and compensation
received. While measures of sponsored research
are routinely published, less is known about faculty consulting. This yields an underestimation of
the impact of the university in transferring technology. Most pointedly, faculty consulting may
complement university technology transfer potential if it opens new research topics and insights into
practical problems for the faculty member.
Another contractual technology-transfer mechanism is university licenses, which provide the
right for companies and others to use university
intellectual property in the codiﬁed form of either
patents or trademarks. These formal transactions
involve a quid pro quo motivated to provide
funding to universities while transferring knowledge and intellectual property rights to ﬁrms.
Licensing agreements diﬀer signiﬁcantly in
terms of their speciﬁcations and scope. Contractual licensing agreements involve selling a company the rights to use a university’s inventions in
return for revenue in the form of up-front fees at
the time of closing the deal, and annual, ongoing
royalty payments that are contingent upon the
commercial success of the technology in a downstream market. The licensing deal depends upon
the assessment of the value of the technology in a
downstream product market which is often diﬃcult to assess and highly uncertain.
Knowledge is both diﬃcult to value and diﬃcult
to appropriate (Zeckhauser, 1996). Contractual
mechanisms used to transfer knowledge such as
licensing agreements are structured as market
transactions—the terms of the transaction are
mutually negotiated and voluntarily agreed upon.

But in contrast to the typical goods involved in
market transactions, the value of knowledge is
uncertain, with uncertainty being highest for the
most upstream, basic research activities. Formal
technology-transfer agreements are negotiated
prior to the research being complete and at a time
when the commercial value of the end results is not
known. Thus, negotiations are based on estimates
of the subjective expected value of that portion of
the knowledge that a ﬁrm will be able to appropriate. This imperfect estimate of the value of
knowledge to the contracting ﬁrm may entail a
market failure: the contractual price may signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the social value.
Royalty rates and terms, and license issue fees
are negotiated. Bray and Lee (2000) report that
license issue fees typically range from $10,000 to
$50,000 but may be as high as $250,000 while
royalty rates are typically 2–5%, but may be as
high as 15%. Licensing agreements vary signiﬁcantly in terms of the scope of the license
granted—nonexclusive/exclusive scope (by sector
or geography), the level of royalty rates, publication delay allowances, duration, and future
option rights (cf. Raider, 1998; Barnes et al.,
1997). Other critical factors—such as the attributes of the technology, the characteristics of the
corporate partner, the policy(ies) of the university holding the patent, the history of relationships between the two players, the role of spatial
proximities, or other idiosyncratic factors—have
not yet been studied in detail. The relative bargaining power of the university and the company
may be very uneven depending upon such
factors as the relative sophistication and
resources of the two players and attributes of the
technology such as its commercial promise and
distance to market, among others. As a result,
the deals negotiated between one ﬁrm and
several universities or between one university and
its licensees may be very diﬀerent. This negotiation, often the ﬁrst transaction in what both
parties might initially see as a long term relationship in order to commercialize a technology,
potentially sets up adversarial positions between
the two actors.
In addition to the potential for generating new
sources of revenue for universities, the licensing
mechanism oﬀers an opportunity for demonstrating that the university was actively engaged

<-----Page 4----->Entpreprenerial Universities and Technology Transfer

in disseminating research results attractive to
industry. In addition, licensing had previously
been conducted by a small number of elite universities and these cases were well-known and
generally regarded as examples of the activists
roles that were required of universities in the wake
of declining industrial competitiveness that was the
rhetoric of Bayh-Dole. New entrants tried to
emulate these eﬀorts and increased licensing
activity was perceived as an indication that these
universities had the potential to advance industrial
activity as well as to serve as engines of growth for
their local economies. Thus, licensing activity
conferred a certain degree of prestige for these
universities.
The right of faculty to share in the licensing
revenue was a provision of the US Bayh-Dole Act,
but the percentage varies as a matter of university
policy. Although faculty enjoy the prospect of
increasing their income, the after-tax return to
faculty from royalties has been relatively disappointing and compares unfavorably with the
revenue that faculty may earn from consulting
(Blake, 1993).
The product on which license income is
paid may be proﬁtable only because of extensive
in-house R&D, manufacturing competitiveness, or
the marketing strength of the licensor. A recent
survey of technology transfer oﬃcers (Jensen and
Thursby, 2001) found that only about 12% of
technology that is licensed is ready for commercialization. The majority of licensed technology
requires signiﬁcant development work and ongoing cooperation with faculty to advance towards a
commercial product.
There is anecdotal evidence that the dimensions
of licensing agreements have changed over time.
At ﬁrst in the US, most university licenses were
granted on a non-exclusive basis to all companies
reﬂecting provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act. Universities now are more likely to negotiate licenses
that are calibrated to certain use or speciﬁc
geographic markets and reﬂect industry practices.
American universities have also experimented with
taking equity in lieu of traditional licensing fees
(Feldman et al., 2002).
The last two mechanisms in Figure 1, spin-oﬀ
companies and the hiring of students are somewhat diﬀerent in that they involve a more direct
technology transfer that takes place through the

179

movement of people. The typical model of the
advanced research student is predicated on the
German model, which essentially provides a
scientiﬁc apprenticeship. As such it depends on a
great detail of attention and mentoring. The
opportunities to implement this model depend on
the workload of professors, the incentives and
rewards oﬀered for diﬀerent types of activities, and
the supply of well-prepared students. Kim (1993)
concludes that the Korean system of innovation
was adversely aﬀected from 1966 to 1985 when the
student–professor ratio increased from 22.6 to
35.8, eﬀectively changing the orientation from research to undergraduate teaching. This eﬀectively
decreased the supply of advanced students who
could be hired by industry and the supply of ideas
that might be used to form companies (Kim,
1993).
University spin-oﬀs have become a favored
mechanism by which universities transfer technology to the commercial realm. Based in part on
the examples of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Stanford University, which
played an active role in the genesis of industrial
clusters in Route 128 and Silicon Valley, respectively, university spin-oﬀs are seen as a means to
transform local economies and a mechanism which
provides a way to capture the beneﬁts of proximity
to research universities. A variety of deﬁnitions
may be used to describe university spin-oﬀs: ﬁrms
formed by university, faculty, or staﬀ; ﬁrms
formed around a university license of intellectual
property; startup ﬁrms that have joint research
projects with the university; and ﬁrms started by
students or post-docs around research conducted
at the university.2
While university licenses have no locational
constraints, entrepreneurship is a decidedly local
phenomenon. In general, entrepreneurs who start
companies do not relocate but instead stay
close to the source of their perceived competitive advantage, which is typically the referent
organization where the founder was previously
employed (Feldman and Francis, 2002). For
university-based spin-oﬀs the university serves as
the source of advantage providing skilled labor,
specialized facilities and expertise. In addition,
faculty who start companies will split their time
between the university and the ﬁrm making close
location advantageous. As universities and state

<-----Page 5----->180

Bercovitz and Feldmann

governments have provided incentives for faculty
to start companies or engage in joint research
projects with companies, the attraction of proximity to universities has grown. In 1999, AUTM
reports that university licensing led to the
formation of 344 new companies, with 82%
operating in the same state as the university that
provided the license.
Individual researcher
At the heart of technology transfer is the individual
faculty member who is motivated by a set of personal and institutional incentives. Life-cycle models
of scientists suggest that scientists invest heavily in
human capital early in their careers to build reputation and establish a position in a ﬁeld of expertise
(Stephan and Levin, 1992). In the later stages of
their career, scientists typically seek an economic
return for their human capital. For scientists,
starting a company serves the purpose of appropriating the value of their intellectual property as
well as providing access to additional funding
mechanisms to further the scientist’s research
agenda. Most critically, academic researchers,
especially government-funded researchers, must
have the ability to retain some rights over their
intellectual property to engage in commercial
activity (Eisenberg, 1987). The potential ﬁnancial
rewards of starting a company coupled with tightening university budgets and competition for the
relatively ﬁxed pool of public funding create
incentives for scientists to engage in entrepreneurial
activity (Powell and Owen-Smith, 1998).
Individual scientists have the intellectual capital
to engage in commercialization activity whether by
simply disclosing an invention or the more
involved activity of starting a company; however,
there are other barriers to consider. For example,
both national culture and academic socialization
can inﬂuence the degree to which individual scientists participate in technology-transfer activities.
McFetridge (1993) ﬁnds that Canadian academics
are relatively immobile and have no incentives to
engage in entrepreneurial activity. Also, Keck
(1993) concludes that the intellectual orientation
of German university professors made them averse
to exploiting new ideas for commercial purposes
even as they were encouraged to do so by university and government policy.

Thursby and Thursby (2002) provide three
reasons why individual faculty members in the
United States might not choose to participate in
technology transfer activities. First, faculty who
specialize in basic research may not disclose
because they are unwilling to spend time on the
applied R&D required to interest businesses in
licensing the invention. Second, faculty may not
disclose inventions because they are unwilling to
risk publication delays associated with patenting
that may be required to interest industrial partners
in licensing the technology. Third, faculty members may not disclose, because they believe that
commercial activity is not appropriate for an
academic scientist. This view certainly represents
the established norms of open academic science
that favour publication over patenting.
Bercovitz and Feldman (2004) ﬁnd that the
decision of the individual faculty member to participate in technology transfer through the process
of disclosing inventions is strongly inﬂuenced by
three factors: training eﬀects, leadership eﬀects
and cohort eﬀects. Individuals are more likely to
disclose inventions if they trained at institutions at
the forefront in terms of technology transfer
benchmarking. Individuals who trained at institutions that have long established and relatively
successful technology transfer operations are more
likely to disclose their inventions. In addition, the
longer the time that had elapsed since graduate
training, the less likely the faculty member was to
actively embrace the new commercialization norm.
Moreover, the actions of the chair of the department appear to inﬂuence behaviour: if the chair is
active in technology transfer then other members
of the department are also likely to disclose. Most
strikingly, technology transfer behavior is mediated by the experience of those in a similar position, in terms of academic rank and departmental
aﬃliation. If an individual can observe others at
their academic rank disclosing, then they are more
likely to participate in technology transfer.

Firm characteristics
The picture is not complete without an
understanding of university–industry technology
transfer from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Unfortunately, there are few studies that consider the

<-----Page 6----->Entpreprenerial Universities and Technology Transfer

ﬁrm, rather than the university, as the focal actor.
Prior research demonstrates signiﬁcant variation
in ﬁrms’ use of external resources, organization of
inter-ﬁrm R&D activity, and objectives in interﬁrm R&D strategic partnerships. Though the
broad literature on strategic R&D alliances
mentions the importance of ﬁrm–university alliances, it does not speciﬁcally focus on the unique
aspects of universities as research partners. As
such, we have only limited understanding of how
university interactions ﬁt within the ﬁrm’s
broader R&D strategy—and how ﬁrm strategy
and organizational structure inﬂuence both the
technology-transfer mechanisms employed by the
ﬁrm and the ultimate relationship the ﬁrm
maintains with the university.
Previous research has shown, however, that
linking with external entities is a key element of
successful exploration strategies that emphasize
the search, discovery, and development of
new knowledge (Von Hippel, 1998; March, 1991;
Cockburn and Henderson, 1994; Rosenkopf and
Nerkar, 2001). Speciﬁcally, such interactions give
the ﬁrm access to knowledge that diﬀers from,
but can complement, the ﬁrm’s existing technology portfolio. It is the integration of this new
knowledge that leads to path-breaking innovation. Academic researchers perform a great deal
of cutting-edge research and universities are
known sources of new knowledge (Rosenberg
and Nelson, 1994). As such, we expect that
pursuing university interactions to tap into such
expertise is likely to be more highly valued by
ﬁrms with innovation strategies that emphasize
exploration rather than exploitation—the reﬁnement, extension, and intelligent use of
existing competencies (March, 1991; Levinthal
and March, 1993).
In general, early stage technologies such as
those originating at universities require more
extensive research investment to reach commercial
viability. Further, while the transfer of knowledge
across organizational boundaries is always challenging, this challenge is intensiﬁed the more
radical the technology to be transferred. As
Mowery and Rosenberg (1989, p. 7) note, ‘‘a new
technology is a complex mix of codiﬁed data
and poorly deﬁned ‘know-how’’’. The successful
transfer of the tacit component of this new
knowledge generally requires close and ongoing

181

interactions between the inventor and the purchaser (Teece, 1985). This is particularly true if the
recipient has limited direct experience with the
technology (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). This
implies that the ﬁrm’s capacity and willingness to
engage in multiple transactions will aﬀect the
potential of eﬀectively transferring meaningful
university-based knowledge.
University technology transfer strategy
and structure
Universities are social as well as economic institutions. Faculty behavior is based on social norms,
organizational structure, and incentives regarding
promotion and tenure (Geiger, 1993). For example, institutional policies regarding faculty
commercialization incentives, acceptable publication delays and the charters of technology transfer
oﬃces vary greatly across research institutions and
have evolved over time. University policies inﬂuence the comparative cost of technology transfer,
and there is great variation in the composition of
university–industry relationships across institutions and the ways in which participation in
technology transfer activities is rewarded.
Understanding historical context provides an
instructive though unfortunately overlooked perspective on current activity and performance.
Feldman and Desrochers (2003, 2004) focus on
the evolution of technology transfer activities at
Johns Hopkins University. By any number of
measures and independent assessments, it is one
of the world’s leading institutions of higher education and research. Yet, despite substantial
academic achievements, Hopkins provides an
example of a university that has had little direct
eﬀect on the regional economy in terms of reaping the beneﬁts of the university’s research in
terms of spin-oﬀ companies and mutual
relationships (Feldman, 1994) and thus provides
an interesting contrast to the well-studied examples of Stanford and MIT. Changing university
culture is possible; however it takes time and
requires providing the correct incentives (Bercovitz and Feldman, 2004).
The ability of individual scientists to appropriate the value of intellectual property will be
aﬀected by university patent and copyright policies. Consequently, variation in intellectual

<-----Page 7----->182

Bercovitz and Feldmann

property rights is one important factor that may
aﬀect technology transfer outcomes (Lach and
Schankerman, 2003). Siegel et al. (1999) have
noted that technology transfer outcomes may
depend on organizational practices that potentially attenuate palpable diﬀerences in the motives, incentives, and organizational cultures of
the players involved in this process.
Bercovitz et al. (2001) consider how university
organizational structure mediates technology
transfer outcomes, ﬁnding that technology transfer
activities, manifested as licensing university-created knowledge, seeking additional sponsorship of
R&D projects or a combination of these two, are
shaped by the resources, reporting relationships,
autonomy, and/or incentives of technology
licensing oﬃces. The analysis treats the structure
of the technology transfer oﬃce as an independent
variable that accounts, in part, for measured interinstitutional diﬀerences in patenting, licensing, and
sponsored research activities. This analytical lens
permits a sharpened focus for examining variation
which others have alluded to in caveats or
qualifying statements, but which has not been
systematically studied.

3. Dynamics: from transactions to relationships
As depicted in Figure 1, the ﬁve transaction
mechanisms listed in Table I do not occur in isolation. University–industry relationships are multifaceted, complex, and diverse, and feedback
loops are common. Commercializing a technology
may encompass many diﬀerent transactions
between a university and a company. For example,
commercialization can involve multiple licenses
and require that a company fund a sponsored
research project for developmental work to usefully apply the licenses. In addition, the company
may subsequently hire students who worked on
the sponsored project. The relationship may be so
fruitful that the company may ultimately endow a
university chair or make another type of philanthropic gift. Only by considering the complexity of
the industry–university relationships can we
obtain a fuller understanding of their nature and
impact.
This framework also incorporates organizational learning eﬀects that dictate evolution in the

form of the industry–university relationship.
Feedback eﬀects, for example, may include an
improvement in contract speciﬁcation, brought
about because the existing speciﬁcation was found
to be poorly suited to support the integrity of
contract. Moreover, through the knowledge
exchange of a single transaction additional projects and ideas for research may result.
In this framework, we expect to see a progression from single transactions to longer-term relationships as trust and joint vision are built. For
example, a ﬁrm’s licensing experience with a
particular university, if positive, is expected to
increase the likelihood of the adoption of a sponsored research agreement. Following this, ﬁrm
involvement with sponsored research or licensing
may increase the likelihood of corporate gifts.
Alternatively, if initial experience with the university technology-transfer oﬃce is negative, ﬁrms
may engage in opportunistic behavior by contracting directly with faculty members, bypassing
the university intellectual property apparatus.
These elements may be best understood by
framing patent and licensing transactions within
the larger relationship framework. The national
and local policy environment and legal framework,
the university environment, and the characteristics
of companies inﬂuence the eﬃciency and thus
evolution of these university–industry relationships. Institutional policies, for example, regarding
faculty commercialization incentives vary greatly
even within the same innovation system.

4. The policy context for innovation
Academic research, whether basic and largely
uncodiﬁed or applied and codiﬁed in the form of
patents, represents only the raw material from
which commercially competitive technological
innovations are constructed (Von Hippel, 1998;
David et al., 1992; Dasgupta and David, 1994).
Supporting institutions and legal frameworks are
credited with the emergence of the industrial
revolution (Rosenberg and Birdsell, 1986). Similarly, the institutions at both the national and
regional level set the parameters for the eﬀectiveness of the commercialization of academic
research and the resulting impacts on economic
growth.

<-----Page 8----->Entpreprenerial Universities and Technology Transfer

Technology transfer policies involve an
inherent compromise that accommodates the
public good nature of knowledge spillovers while
providing the property rights that are required to
guarantee returns for the additional private
investment required to commercialize academic
research. Although governments typically have
provisions for university intellectual property
protection, there are great diﬀerences in their
enforcement and use. In the US case, commercialization of biotechnology and microelectronics
by university startups was aided by a permissive
intellectual property regime. For example, the
1986 consent degree that settled the suit against
AT&T resulted in liberal licensing and crosslicensing policies that aided start-ups in telecommunications. In biotechnology, uncertainty over
both the strength and breadth of intellectual
property protection discouraged litigation and
encouraged industry and academia to work together (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1993, p. 49).
Nations also diﬀer greatly in terms of the
resources allocated to university R&D and in
terms of the percentage of funds that come from
industry. Table II demonstrates that the percentage of GNP spent on university R&D varies from
a high of 2.8% in Japan to a low of 0.7% in the
Russian Federation. Industry support of academic
R&D varies from a high of 10.7% in Canada to a
low of 2.3% in Japan. Of course, caution should
prevail when interpreting these numbers given

183

diﬀerences in the way governments account for
expenditures.
Universities are involved in a two-phase process
that involves ﬁrst the production of knowledge and
then its application and diﬀusion. Linkages
between academic and industrial research appear
to be powerfully inﬂuenced by the degree of centralization of the funding system. There is a belief
that competition for funding, diversity of funding
sources, and, in general, a decentralized funding
system would be more conducive to university–
industry relationships. It is easier for industry to sit
at the table in a decentralized system. In addition,
decentralized systems tend to be responsive to local
industries. For example, Mowery and Rosenberg
(1993, pp. 35–36) argue that systems in which the
federal government allocates research funding (for
example the United Kingdom and France) are not
as responsive to industry as are systems such as the
United States and Germany, where states allocate
substantial funding. Decentralization may also be
manifested by a number of separate federal agencies with distinctly separate missions and goals that
generate heterogeneous demand for research. We
may expect that considerations such as the degree
of competition between universities for funding,
the diversity of sources such as foundations, and
other entities that may fund riskier research can
have an eﬀect on the relationship. For example,
the four Framework Programs of the European
Communities for the support of cooperative R&D

projects have taken a highly competitive approach.
Knowledge production increasingly is trans-disciplinary and depends on the ability of researchers to
work with others across a broad spectrum of
disciplines. A system that adheres to rigid disciplinary boundaries in funding research projects will
inhibit these interactions and thus may limit technology-transfer opportunities.
Regional policy operates within the conﬁnes of
parameters deﬁned by the national system with
great variation in autonomy regarding funding
local initiatives. Within the federalist systems
found in the US, Germany, Canada and Australia,
there is greater autonomy and more focus on
increasing economic eﬃciency and competitiveness. For example, in the US, each of the ﬁfty states
provide a myriad of specialized programs ranging
from business planning services to marketing and
personnel training assistance (Schachtel and
Feldman, 2000). More centralized governments
tend to place greater focus on redistribution.
Regions begin with pre-existing industrial
structures that are the result of history. An older
economic development strategy of providing costreducing incentives is based on the neoclassical
view that ﬁrms’ location decisions are responsive
to small diﬀerence in input prices: ﬁrms should
prefer locations that oﬀer lower factor prices and
therefore state programs that reduce costs should
inﬂuence locational decisions. However, for high
technology ﬁrms in particular, skilled labor services and proximity to sources of knowledge and
expertise are much more important than cost
reductions. Indeed, innovative start-ups frequently
create new markets where no competition exists
and demand is not sensitive to product costs. The
small ﬁrms’ competitive advantage lies in being
ﬁrst to market or oﬀering a higher quality product.
Small ﬁrms, lacking the resources of their larger
counterparts, are more dependent on resources in
their local environments. Indeed, many times small
ﬁrms become the mechanism by which academic
knowledge is commercialized. Therefore, the success of the ﬁrm and the success of the region are
inter-related or endogenous in the terminology of
economics.
Many local political initiatives are aimed at
leveraging local universities for their knowledgebased growth potential and have met with varying degrees of success. Visible eﬀorts such as local

incubators and science parks are demonstrable
indicators of commitment (Link et al., 2003). The
cases where governments have established a
cluster by ﬁat such as Science Park in Taiwan or
the Bio-Regio clusters in Germany have not yet
generated mature, innovative industrial clusters.
Perhaps it is too early to judge in all cases. In
other cases, the attempt to artiﬁcially establish a
cluster where none existed previously has resulted
either in failure or resulted in a completely different type of cluster than initially envisioned. A
good example is New Jersey’s attempt to create a
Silicon Valley-type high tech sector that eventually resulted in a limited research consortium
(Kargon and Leslie, 1997). Cortright and Mayer
(2001) conclude that there is no general set of
conditions that generate particular industrial
clusters in the US; rather, there appears to be a
unique factor associated with each. An alternative
view is that cluster formation is a process—a
complex self-organizing process that is predicated
on the actions of entrepreneurs and their symbiotic relationship with their local environments.
The cluster and the characteristics of the cluster
therefore emerge over time from the individual
activities of the entrepreneurs and the organizations and institutions that co-evolve to support
them (Feldman, 2000; Feldman and Francis,
2002).
The idea that universities may be engines of
local economic development is challenged by the
counterfactual cases of prominent research universities that have not spawned technology-based
spin-oﬀs. Feldman (1994) examines the case of
Johns Hopkins University and the Baltimore
region. Although Johns Hopkins is one of the
world’s pre-eminent institutions and receives more
research funding than either Stanford or MIT, the
surrounding region has not beneﬁted from
technology-based industrial activity. Feldman
(1994) provides evidence that the region was not
able to develop an innovative infrastructure that
allowed it to capture the beneﬁts of proximity to
the local research university. In subsequent work,
Feldman and Desrochers (2004) examine the historical relationship of the university with the local
economy and question if the current emphasis on
academic–industry interaction with its emphasis
on short-term measure transactions may undermine and destroy that very strength and diversity

To summarize, Table III provides a summary
of policy considerations that impact university
technology-transfer mechanisms and would vary
across innovation systems. These may be regarded
as questions to begin an inquiry about considerations that aﬀect the ability of the university to
transfer knowledge.

5. Conclusions
Economic development is about innovation and
innovative activity. Typically, studies of the role of
universities in systems of innovation tend to focus
on metrics that are related to inputs and outputs in
the familiar logic of a production function. Inputs
such as amounts of research funding, numbers of
faculty or scientiﬁc personnel, quality of academic
programs or resources devoted to technology
transfer are measurable and collected by government and professional organizations (See, for
example, US National Science Board, 2002;
AUTM, 2003). The outputs in this context are the
number of patents, the number of licenses to
industry, the number of spin-oﬀ ﬁrms or indicators
of employment change or economic growth. These
elements form a quantiﬁable component of university–industry interaction; however there is great
variation in commercialization of academic discoveries among universities and the relationship of
university inputs to a variety of technology transfer output measures is not strictly deterministic
and many universities operate below the eﬃcient
production frontier (Siegel et al., 1999; Thursby

and Kemp, 2002). This suggests that technology
transfer involves social convention and legal rights
as well as economic interests.
While universities have a long recognized role in
the system of innovation, this role has changed.
The new role of universities as engines of local
economic development (Feller, 1990) or magic
beanstalks of invention and research (Miner et al.,
2001) places new demands on universities and
raises question about the role of research universities in advanced economies. Many universities
have restructured their research capabilities to be
more responsive to local industry—for example,
setting up specialized research units, joint cooperative ventures or interdisciplinary projects that
are more receptive to industrial needs. These specialized units may focus on revitalizing existing
industries. In transferring technology, universities
contribute to the stock of technologies that ﬁrms
may draw on for innovation and economic
growth. Some have raised the concern that universities are being asked to deviate from a
historically successful role and that increased
commercial inﬂuences may destroy the norms of
open science that have promoted the national
interest (Nelson, 2001). These same concerns may
be raised at the regional level. Universities certainly add more to their local economies than the
metrics of technology transfer capture. There are
certainly many diﬀerent modes of how universities
interact with and enrich their local economies than
simply counting technology transfer indicators.
In the wake of the success of Silicon Valley and
Route 128, where thriving locally based ﬁrms were
often linked to the major academic institutions
such as Stanford University and the Massachusetts

<-----Page 11----->186

Bercovitz and Feldmann

Institute of Technology (MIT), research universities have been increasingly called on to help foster
local economic development through technology
transfer and the formation of startup ﬁrms based
on academic research. Universities are viewed by
many as engines of economic growth and continue
to be cited as an important factor in
regional technology development and revitalization. However, the process of university-led economic development takes considerable time and
patience that is often outside of the immediate
demands of the political process. Link (2002)
concludes that the development of North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park was the result of
deliberate public policies that began in the 1920s
and took 50 years to realize tangible economic
beneﬁt in terms of job growth and enterprise
development. Sturgeon (2000) ﬁnds similarly that
the genesis of Silicon Valley may be traced to the
early twentieth century.
Universities have demonstrated their adaptability in their response to active technology
transfer. Certainly, attempts to spin oﬀ new
companies satisfy an increased expectation that
universities need to be engaged in local economic
development and to demonstrate relevance. We
may question if university programs aimed to
encourage entrepreneurship are the best use of
state and university resources. One of the strengths
of the American system of higher education has
been its diversity and decentralization. We may
also question if the examples provided by WARF,
Stanford University and MIT have established a
de facto standard against which all research
universities are judged and what the long run
implications will be.
The basic premise of this paper is that the legal,
economic, and policy environments that comprise
the system of innovation determine the rate and
type of university knowledge production and
thereby inﬂuence the rate of technological change.
Moreover, within a given university, there will be
additional internal inﬂuences that determine the
rates and directions of knowledge ﬂow from that
institution. This paper has the modest aim of
identifying these inﬂuences and speculating on
their eﬀect on knowledge transfer. Certainly, given
the limitations of space and time, this paper raises
more questions than it answers. But certainly an
understanding of the evolution of the role of the

university in systems of innovation warrants
further attention. If we are going to think creatively about public policies towards increasing
university technology transfer, we need to focus on
the larger innovation context.
Notes
1. Critics argue that these relationships may detract from the
university’s basic mission, inhibit intellectual freedom, and
foster public mistrust of science. Aspects of these changes have
been described in abundance, written from many diﬀerent
analytical perspectives. See, for example, Baldwin and Green
(1984–1985), Brooks and Randazzese (1998), Etzkowitz and
Peters (1991), Etzkowitz and Leydesdorﬀ (1997), Feller (1990),
Geiger (1993), Government–University–Industry Research
Roundtable (1986), Lee (1998), Luger and Goldstein (1991),
Peters and Fusfeld (1983), Praeger and Omenn (1980), Rahm
(1994), Slaughter (1990).
2. The Association of University Technology Managers
(AUTM) uses the second criteria, ﬁrms formed around a university license to track university spin-oﬀs. In practice, this
deﬁnition is restrictive as more spin-oﬀs are likely to be the
result of individuals associated with the university promoting
technology by beginning ﬁrms.
