Over the past several years, I have become more interested in approaches to estimating
interrater agreement—thus, this book seemed right up my alley. Naı̈vely, I thought this
book would be an easy read and an even easier review; however, after reading the table of
contents I realized well over half of the material in this book was new to me. As I worked
through the text, I was reminded how many of us in industrial and organizational
psychology/organizational behavior (IOOB) tend to rely on fairly narrow paradigms for
conceptualizing rater agreement. We have become relatively methodcentric, emphasizing
dispersion-based indices of within-group agreement such as rWG , aWG , ADM , and SDX at
the expense of other approaches. This book discusses some of those other approaches.
Thus, if you are looking for a review of traditional within-group agreement indices, this is
not the book for you. However, if you are looking to expand your knowledge of agreement
beyond such statistics and rethink the fundamental paradigms used to conceptualize agreement, then you might find this book worth the read.
Chapter 1 introduces Cohen’s kappa statistic (and several of its derivatives). These statistics are used with cross-classification frequency tables for two or more raters. Such
tables summarize the extent to which raters rated the same set of targets using the same or
different rating categories for each target. Kappa, often used with nominal or ordinal data,
furnishes information about the level of agreement for the entire cross-classification table.
Specifically, it provides a researcher with an estimate of the percentage of agreement
above and beyond what would be expected by chance. Thus, it is quite helpful when one
seeks a global estimate of agreement. However, it is not able to address more substantive
hypotheses about how raters weight the various rating categories or to test hypotheses
about how potential covariates are related to agreement. To test such hypotheses,
advanced modeling techniques are needed.
Chapter 2 introduces a set of such techniques known as log-linear models. These models represent a special case of the generalized linear models and are designed to test the
relationship between two or more discrete, categorical variables by examining the natural
logarithm of the cell frequencies in a cross-classification table. Chapter 2 shows how these
models are used to test hypotheses that are not testable using kappa (or its variants). For
example, using log-linear models one can test a hypothesis that all rating categories are
given equal weights or differential weights by the raters. For example, a researcher might
ask two executives to evaluate the upper managers in a company using a 3-point scale on
which 1 = not candidate for executive leadership, 2 = candidate for executive leadership,
and 3 = high potential candidate for executive leadership. Using the log-linear models
presented in chapter 2, this researcher could determine whether greater weight was used
by these executives (raters) when assigning people to the high-potential category or
whether they applied weights to all categories. Chapter 2 also discusses how potential continuous and categorical covariates could be included in the model. Overall, this chapter
achieves its goal, but I suspect readers who are unfamiliar with log-linear models and
other forms of categorical data analysis may find themselves rereading several sections of

this chapter or referring to other textbooks to gain additional information about these models (I know I did).
Whereas kappa and log-linear models are often used to test a priori hypotheses, the
methods described in chapter 3 are typically used in a more exploratory context. Specifically, chapter 3 introduces configural frequency analysis (CFA), which may be used to
explore the extent to which the levels of agreement (or lack thereof) vary across the specific rating categories and to explore the extent to which a particular pattern or configuration
of ratings agrees (or disagrees) above and beyond some baseline model of chance agreement (or disagreement). Let’s return to our previous example in which two executives
(raters) have been asked to evaluate a set of managers (targets) in terms of their future
executive potential. Using CFA, researchers could explore the extent to which levels of
agreement varied across the rating category. For example, researchers might learn that the
executives have very high agreement on their ratings of 1 (i.e., not a candidate for executive leadership) but had higher levels of disagreement for their ratings of 2 and 3. This
would suggest that raters agree in terms of who might be a ‘‘bad’’ executive but are not
able to agree in terms of who might be a high-potential candidate versus a typical candidate. The procedures presented in chapter 3 permit exploring such patterns of agreement
and disagreement at the level of individual rating categories. In addition, this chapter, like
chapter 2, also explains how covariates could be included when using CFA to examine
patterns of agreement or disagreement.
Chapter 4 moves away from analyzing cross-classification frequency tables and instead
presents techniques for comparing the patterns of correlations among groups of raters.
Most readers will likely be familiar with the standard Pearson correlations and intraclass
correlations discussed in this chapter. Using these types of correlations, the authors
describe how tests for homogeneity of correlation matrices could be conducted. For example, a researcher might use the techniques described in this chapter if he or she had data
from a group of men (N = 100) and a group of women (N = 100) who were asked to rate
various dimensions of work–family conflict (e.g., time-, strain-, and behavior-based
work–family conflict). In such a situation, this researcher might wonder whether the
patterns of ‘‘agreement’’ (defined as correlations between the dimensions) were homogeneous across groups.
Chapter 5 demonstrates how to implement the procedures introduced in the first four
chapters of the book using a wide range of software programs, including SPSS, SAS, and
LISREL. This chapter, when combined with the sample exercises included with the other
chapters, really helps the reader integrate a technical understanding of these procedures
with a practical understanding of how to generate the necessary output using common statistical software packages. This chapter also reviews how to use several specialty programs to test for agreement. Many of these specialty programs are available free of charge
or may be downloaded for a free trial period. The final chapter simply recapitulates the
previous chapters before briefly describing how issues of rater agreement may be extended
to latent variable analysis, namely variations on latent class modeling.
In general, I found the ideas presented in this book to be stimulating. However, before
recommending this book to organizational researchers, several caveats are in order. First,
the techniques discussed in this book are most applicable in situations in which one has
multiple raters evaluating multiple targets. This is often the case in organizational

research. However, there are some limited instances in which one might be interested
summarizing patterns of agreement when multiple raters evaluate a single target. Second,
as described in the text, these techniques are largely applicable to situations in which one
has a crossed design. That is, most of these techniques assume that each rater evaluated
each target. Although such designs do occur in IOOB research (e.g., structured panel interviews in which each job applicant is evaluated by the same set of raters), they are often
not the norm. In many instances, raters are not crossed with targets but are instead nested
within targets (e.g., the typical climate study in which raters are nested within organization). Individuals dealing with nested, not crossed, designs may still find this book intellectually stimulating, but I doubt they would find it to be practically useful for their work,
especially when dealing with very large numbers of raters. Third, the procedures described
in this book focus heavily on estimating agreement for categorical data, specifically
nominal and ordinal data. Researchers collecting data using an interval or ratio scale may
benefit from using other techniques. Finally, because this book focuses heavily on analyzing categorical data, it assumes a basic degree of fluency with log-linear models. Individuals lacking that basic knowledge are encouraged to supplement this book with a more
basic categorical data analysis book (Agresti, 2002).
