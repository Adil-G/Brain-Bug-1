This article provides theory and evidence in support of theproposition that venture capitalists
adjust their investment decisions according to liquidity conditions on IPO exit markets. We
refer to technological risk as a choice variable in terms of the characteristics of the
entrepreneurialfirm in which the venture capitalist invests, and liquidity risk as the current
and expectedfutureexternalexit marketconditions. Weshow that in times of expectedilliquidity
of exit markets (high liquidity risk), venture capitalists invest proportionately more in new
high-techand early-stageprojects (high technologyrisk) in order topostpone exit requirements.
Whenexit marketsare liquid, venture capitalists rush to exit by investing more in later-stage
projects. Wefurtherprovide complementaryevidence thatshows that conditions of low liquidity
risk give rise to less syndication. Our theory and supporting empirical results facilitate a
unifying theme that links related research on illiquidity in private equity.

Policymakersaroundthe world often express concern aboutwhy there is not more investmentin
privatelyheld early-stagecompanies.'Further,the extremecyclicality of early-stageinvestment,and
what the drivers are, remains a relatively unexplored issue in private equity and venture capital
research.2This article introduces a new and somewhat counterintuitive theory to facilitate an
understandingof these issues. The US data examined herein supportthe theory.
Venturecapitalists("VCs")invest in small privategrowth companies that typically do not have
cash flows to pay intereston debt or dividends on equity.VCs invest in private companies
aaa over
period that generallyranges from two to seven years priorto exit. As such, VCs derive theirreturns
throughcapital gains in exit transactions.IPO exits typically provide VCs with the greatestreturns
andreputational
benefits(Gompers,199and Gompersand
ui,
nLerner, 1999, 2001).3Liquidityriskin the
context of VC finance thereforerefers to exit risk, particularlyIPO exit risk. That is, liquidity risk
refers to the risk of not being able to effectively exit and thus being forced either to remainmuch

in Gilson (2003) and Lerner (1999).
2In a collection of their groundbreakingwork, Gompers and Lerner (1999) study fundraising, fund structure,staging,
syndication, monitoring, and venture-capital-backed IPOs. This work provides the basis for all private equity and
venture capital research,including our own paper. Many of these issues are also discussed in Barry (1994).
3Acquisitionexits (sales to a large strategicacquirer)can also be a profitableform of exit, althoughperhapstypically less
desirable in terms of profitabilityand less desirable to the entrepreneurwho would otherwise prefer to be the CEO of a
publicly traded corporation(Black and Gilson, 1998). Less successful investments might be sold by the VC to another
investor (a "secondary sale," whereby the entrepreneurmaintains his or her share of the company), or repurchasedby
the entrepreneur(a "buybackexit"). Many VC investments (20-30%) are written off (Gompers and Lerner, 1999, 2001;
Cochrane, 2005; Das, Jagannathan,and Sarin, 2003, and Cumming, Fleming, and Schwienbacher,2005).

longer in the venture or to sell the shares at a high discount.4The risk of not being able to
effectively exit an investment is an importantreason why VCs requirehigh returnson their
investments (Lerner, 2000, 2002; Lerner and Schoar, 2004, 2005). It is therefore naturalto
expect that exit market liquidity affects VCs' incentives to invest in different types of
entrepreneurialfirms.
Liquidityrisk is, of course, not the only type of risk thatVCs face when deciding to invest in a
particularproject.The othertypes of risk may be groupedinto a broadcategoryof what we refer
to in this article as technological risk, or the risk of investing in a project of uncertainquality
(particulartypes of technologicalrisk could includethe qualityof the producttechnology as well
as the qualityof entrepreneurs'technicalandmanagerialabilities).This articleconsiderswhether
changes in externalconditions of liquidityrisk give rise to adjustmentsin VCs' undertakingof
projectswith differentdegrees of technological risk. In particular,we investigate whether exit
marketliquidity affects the frequencyof VC investmentin nascent early-stagefirms and hightech firms with intangibleassets.5We provide a theory and supportingempiricalevidence that
show the willingness of VCs to undertakeprojectsof high technologicalrisk is directlyrelatedto
conditionsof liquidityrisk.We furtherprovidecomplementaryevidence thatshows thatexternal
conditionsof high liquidityrisk give rise to moreprevalentsyndication,which in turnshows that
while VCs assumemore technologicalrisk in periodsof low liquidity,they take steps to mitigate
this risk throughsyndication.We show that the theory and evidence in regardsto liquidity risk
introducedhereinprovides a unifying theme that links the results in a numberof relatedpapers
on venturecapital finance.
We introducea theoreticalmodel that shows that VCs will rationallytrade-offliquidity risk
against technological risk by investing more in early-stage projectswhen the liquidity of exit
marketsis low andthus the exit risk is high. The intuitionunderlyingourmodel is as follows. By
adjustingtheir portfolio of investments for long-termpositions, VCs reduce their exposure to
liquidity risk. This is importantin explaining the choice of projects accordingto their stage of
development(earlystageversusexpansionstage),andthe decisionwhetherto investin completely
new projectsor to limit investmentsto ongoing projects. In contrast,when the liquidity of exit
marketsis high, VCs tend to invest proportionatelymore in later-stageprojectsin orderto rush
for exit and thus to hold short-termpositions and technologically less risky projects.The theory
therefore gives rise to a somewhat counterintuitiveconjecture of a positive correspondence
betweenconditionsof externalexit marketliquidityriskandVCs' contemporaneousundertaking
of a greateramountof technologicalrisk.
It is importantto point out thatthe ultimatesource of the liquidityrisk analyzedin this article
is the difference in time preferences between VCs and management,since there is a greater
incentive for VCs to cash out earlierthan management.The time horizon of a VC is typically
shorterbecause of his exit requirements.If VCs were long-terminvestorsandwould not wish to
exit alreadyafter a few years, liquidity risk would not matterand incentives between VCs and
managementwould probably be better aligned (provided managers are capable and wish to
remainin place).
4Marketmicrostructuremodels refer to the latter as the cost of immediacy, which represents the price discount
that the holder of the asset has to incur if he wants to sell it now instead of waiting to get the marketprice. More
generally, Harris (2003) distinguishes between four different dimensions of liquidity, namely: 1) width (difference
between the buy price and the sell price), 2) immediacy (how fast large volumes of shares can be traded),3) depth
(number of shares that can be exchanged without affecting prices), and 4) resiliency (how quick prices go back to
the "normal price level").
5Related to technological risk (but not liquidity risk), Trigeorgis (1993) provides a real option approach to
stage financing.

With respect to early-stageinvestments,there are thereforetwo opposite effects documented
in this article. On the one hand, more liquidity increases the likelihood of investing in new
ventures;but on the otherhand, it reducesthe likelihood thatthese new venturesare in the early
stage. In other words, liquidity increases the absolute numberof new investments,but reduces
the proportionof venturesthatget early-stagefinancerelativeto the totalnumberof investments.
These results thus indicate that VCs adjusttheir expected demandfor liquidity to the expected
supply.If they expect low liquidityin the future,they reducetheirfuturedemandfor liquidityby
reducingthe absolutenumberof new venturesand by postponingthe demandfor liquidityfor a
portion of the new investmentsby financing ventures in their early stages.
We empiricallytest our theory by examining how investmentdecisions evolve over time by
looking at the period 1985 - 2004 in regardsto the stage of entrepreneurialfirm development,as
well as the technological focus of investment.We use investmentdata from the VentureXpert
databaseto test our researchhypotheses. We documentthe existence of a negative relationship
between the liquidityof exit marketsand the likelihood of investing in new early-stageprojects.
The proxy used for liquidityis the annualIPO volume. Ourestimationsindicatethat an increase
in liquidityby 100 IPOs in a year reducesthe likelihood of investing in new early-stageprojects
(as comparedto new investmentsin other developmentstages) by approximately1.5%- 2.3%
depending on the specification. These values are not excessively large, but are nevertheless
economically significant as it is well documentedthat the IPO marketsthemselves experience
very largeswings (forrecentwork,see, e.g., Bradley,Jordan,andRitter,2003, Helwege andLiang,
2002, andLowry,2003).
At first thought, it may seem counterintuitivethat there is a negative relation between the
liquidity of IPO marketsand early-stageinvestments.The oft-repeatedcasual empiricism(see,
e.g., practitioner articles on www.ventureeconomics.com) is that there is more early-stage
investmentwhen stock marketsare performingbetter(i.e., IPO marketsare more liquid). In our
analysis we provide independent controls for stock market conditions (with and without
simultaneousconsiderationof IPO volume), and show a positive correspondencebetween the
NASDAQ composite index and the likelihood of early-stage investments. This latterresult is
somewhatanalogousto the money-chasingdeals phenomenonanalyzedby Gompersand Lerer
(2000), but is an independenteffect and differentfrom the centralliquidityissues consideredin
this article.6
To furtherour evidence on liquidityrisk and early-stageinvestment,we show that conditions
of exit marketliquidityimpactthe decision to invest in new projectsversus follow-on investment
in continuingprojectspursuantto staged financing(in the spiritof Gompers, 1995). An increase
in IPO volume by 100 increasesthe probabilityof investmentin a new project(as opposed to a
follow-on project)by approximately1.2%- 4.1%, dependingon the specification(similarto the
evidencein GompersandLemer,2000). Takentogetherwiththefirsteffectof IPOvolumementioned
above, this means that there are two opposite effects when liquidity risk increases:First, there
are proportionatelymore new early-stageprojects, and second, since VCs invest in fewer new
projects, there are more follow-on projects in the VCs' portfolio. The weight of follow-on
investments in the overall portfolio will thereforebe greaterwhen liquidity risk is high since
fewer new investmentsare made, while follow-on investmentsare often continuedand are most
likely alreadyat the expansion stage or later stage of development.
6In a recent paper (May 2005), Gompers, Kovner, Scharfstein, and Lerer (2005) work on issues related to ours.
Their paper considers a sample up to 1998 in order to exclude the Internet bubble. Our sample, described in
Sections III-V, considers the period 1985-2004 and excludes the period surrounding the Internet bubble as a
robustness check. Consistent with seminal work (Gompers and Lerner, 1998), Gompers et al. (2005) argue that
the pattern of venture capital investing follows economic trends in a fairly rational way.

Wefurtherprovidecomplementaryanalysesof therelationbetweenliquidityriskandsyndication,
in the spiritof Lemer(1994a, 1994b)andBrander,Amit, andAntweiler(2002). Whenliquidityrisk
is low, investment is less risky and thus we expect a less pronouncedincentive to syndicate.
Conversely,when liquidity risk is high, VCs prefer to mitigate risk by syndicatingwith more
partnersin order to better screen their projects and to provide complementaryvalue-added
assistance across undertakenprojects. The data examined supportthis conjecturedeffect of
liquidity on syndicate size. An increase in IPO volume by 100 gives rise to approximately0.2
fewer syndicatedpartners.
The remainderof this articleproceedsas follows. In Section I, we discuss the liquidityconcept
for privateequity,and explain how our model and empiricsrelateto priorresearchon the topic.
Section II provides a model that shows the effect of externalexit marketliquidity on the VC's
assumptionof technologicalrisk.Threecore testablehypothesesaresummarizedin SectionII. In
Section III, we present and describe the data. The empirical tests and results are provided in
SectionIV.Thereafterwe discuss limitationsandfutureresearch,andprovideconcludingremarks.

I. LiquidityConcept for VentureCapitaland Private Equity
For such financial assets as publicly listed equity, there seems to be consensus about the
concept of liquidity.Four differentdimensions have been suggested to define the concept for
tradedassets(Harris,2003; Kyle, 1985):width,immediacy,depth,andresiliency.Looselyspeaking,
liquidityrefersto the ability to tradeat low (explicit and implicit) transactioncosts. Kyle (1985)
furtherstresses the importanceof continuoustradingand frictionlessmarketsto achieve perfect
liquidity of assets.
As for real estate or art objects, private equity is infrequentlytradedand thus the standard
concept of liquidity hardly applies.7Private equity investments are not continuously traded,
since by definition they are private prior to the IPO. An importantelement that distinguishes
privatefrompublic equity is thatIPOmarketsarecharacterizedby "hot"and "cold"issue phases
and by clusteringwaves. In this article, liquidity is relatedto the possibility of exiting by either
listing the company on a stock marketor finding a strategicbuyer.The notion of liquidityused
here is closest to the dimension of immediacy,since here liquidity representsthe likelihood of
being able to divest (cost of immediacy).Das et al. (2003) show thatthis illiquiditymay induce a
substantialnon-tradabilitydiscount.
Throughoutthis article, we use the numberof IPOs per year on the NASDAQ, NYSE, and
AMEX as proxy for the liquidity of exit markets.8Although this proxy considers only the IPO
markets,it also gives a good idea of what happenson corporateM&A markets.Thereare strong
links between stock marketsand corporateM&A markets.In particular,stock marketconditions
are also crucialfor acquisitions("tradesales") for differentreasons: 1) An IPOmay representan
outside option for highly profitableventuresthat have the potentialto go public (in this case, it
directly affects the price in an acquisition);2) capital inflow into the VC market is strongly
correlatedwith stock market conditions (this affects total investments and therefore also the
absolute number of trade sales); 3) stock market conditions determinethe cost of capital for
acquisitionswhenthebuyeris listed;and4) stockmarketsalso mirrorgeneraleconomicconditions.
7Recently, new approaches have been suggested to value illiquid assets and build a VC index (e.g., Peng,
2001a, 2001b).
8Jenkinson and Ljungqvist (2001) denote this same proxy as the annual "IPO volume." We further consider
alternativedefinitionsof the annual IPO volume based on data posted on Jay Ritter'swebsite (http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/
ritter/ipodata.htm),as discussed later.

Therefore,we should expect M&A marketsto closely follow the IPO cycle. Also, an IPO is very
often (butnot only) whatVCs aim at when investingin a new venture(GompersandLerer, 1999,
2001). In fact, when we introducedcontrolsfor the liquidityof M&A markets,9we encountereda
number of collinearity problems with our other liquidity measures. As such, consistent with
GompersandLerer (1999, 2000, 2001), ourfocus is on the liquidityof IPOexit markets.
Our theory and supportingempirical evidence facilitate a unifying theme that links related
research on illiquidity in private equity, including studies on VC fundraising,investing, and
exiting. In regardsto VC fundraising,Lernerand Schoar(2004) introducean innovativemodel
andprovidenew datathatshow thatVCs choose greatertechnologicalrisk(usingthe terminology
in our article) in orderto screen deep-pocketinvestors.The intuitionunderlyingthe Lerer and
Schoar result is that institutionalinvestors that face illiquidity constraintsmay not be able to
provideadditionalcapitalin the VC's next roundof fundraising,which would increasethe cost of
capitalfor the VC if the VC had to approachnew outside investors.Ourresultsare consistent,in
thatwe may view the effectiveness of this screeningtool as being subjectto externalexit market
liquidityconditions.In periodsof low exit marketliquidityrisk (in boom periods),the incentive
for a VC to assume greatertechnological risk as a screening tool would be diminished, since
institutionalinvestorstend to be less subjectto capitalconstraintsin boom periods. Conversely,
in periods of high liquidity risk, a greaternumberof institutionalinvestors will be faced with
constraints(i.e., a greaterproportiondo not have deep pockets in bust periods), and therefore
the VC's assumptionof greatertechnological risk facilitates a more effective screeningtool for
institutionalinvestors that have deep pockets.
Ourarticleis furtherrelatedto a numberof papersthat fall underthe categoryof VC investing
andvalue-addedadvice.KanniainenandKeuschnigg(2003, 2004) andKeuschnigg(2004) provide
theoreticalwork indicatingthatliquidityaffects VC portfoliosize andthe demandfor and supply
of VC. Cumming(2006) provides consistent evidence that VC portfolio sizes per managerare
largerin boom periods.Neus andWalz(2005) providea theorythatrelatesexit marketliquidityto
VC dispositions, consistent with evidence in Gompersand Lerer (1999). Kortumand Lerer
(2000) andLemer(2002) provideevidencethatVCs addless valueandcontributeless to innovation
amongtheir entrepreneurialinvestee firms in boom periods (e.g., the Interet bubble)relativeto
more normaltimes. Gompersand Lerner(2000) provide evidence of"money-chasing deals" in
boom periods, where VCs have excess capitaland thereare too few qualityprojects.Ourtheory
and evidence is supportiveof all of these papers. VCs funded an impressive numberof laterstageprojectsduringthe Interet bubbleof 1998-2000 where exit was not a problem,while today
they are more selective (proactive) and again prefer ventures with break-throughtechnology.
Duringthe bubbleperiod, many venturesof low innovationwere fundedand for which time-tomarketis shorter;afterthe bubbleburst,low innovationventuresdid not receive fundingas VCs
were muchmore selective. Ourarticleprovidesa theoryandsupportiveevidence thatthis change
in investmentbehavioris largelyattributable
to conditionson the exit markets(i.e., theircyclicality).
Ourevidence in regardsto VC syndicationand liquidityis also relatedto a numberof papers
on liquidityand transactionstructures.Black andGilson (1998) discuss the relationbetween exit
marketliquidity,VC contracting,and the developmentof VC markets.Bascha and Walz (2001)
providea theoryrelatingIPO exit marketsto the use of convertiblesecuritiesin venturefinance.
Lernerand Schoar(2005) relate liquidityand othermarketcharacteristicsto the structureof VC
contractsin developingcountries.In seminalwork,Gompers(1995) shows thatstagingdecisions
arerelatedto marketconditions,and Lerner(1994a, 1994b) shows thatsyndicationis affectedby
incentivesto mitigaterisk, among otherthings (see also Gompersand Lerner,1999, 2001).
9OurM&A liquidity marketcontrols were based on data available from the Mergerstatreview (www.mergerstat.com).

<-----Page 6----->FinancialManagement* Winter2005

Finally,our evidence is consistentwith the view thatilliquidityis one reasonwhy VCs require
high returnson theirinvestments(GompersandLerner,1999a,2001; see also Barry,Muscarella,
Perry,and Vetsuypens,1990; Megginson and Weiss, 1991; Lernerand Schoar,2004; Cochrane,
2005; Das et al., 2003). Ourevidence is consistent,in thatthe greaterassumptionof technological
riskoccursat times when we may inferthatthe relativecost of financinginnovativedeals is lower.
Thatis, in bustperiodswhen illiquidityis high, it is generallyviewed thatthe deal cost (in termsof
the amountthat a VC must pay for a given equity sharein a company)is low; therefore,in bust
periods,the cost of financingthe more innovativecompaniesis lower.This is consistentwith our
findingof a higherproportionof financingsof early-stagefirmsin periodsof exit marketilliquidity.

II. The Model and the Testable Hypotheses
This section providesa theoreticalframeworkfor the empiricalpredictionsthatareempirically
tested in the rest of the article. Note that we refer to technological risk as a choice variablein
termsof the characteristicsof the entrepreneurialfirm in which the VC invests, and liquidityrisk
as the expected externalexit marketconditions.Testablehypothesesderivedfrom the model are
formallystated.
Suppose a start-upventurerequiresexternalfunding for two consecutive rounds;the first is
known as the early-stageround,the second as the later-stageround.In each round,an amount
of fundingis needed,I, > 0 for the firstroundand 12> 0 for the second round.The probabilityof
failureat each stage/roundis (1 -p) > 0 and determinesthe technologicalrisk of the project;we
assume this risk is (1 -p) for a later-stageinvestmentand (1 -p2) for an early-stageinvestment.
To keep the expositionas simple as possible, andwithoutloss of generality,we assumea discount
rateof zero and thatall partiesare risk-neutral.The marketvalue of the start-upat the end of the
second roundis V> 0 if successful, and 0 in the case of failure.When financingthe projectsince
the first round,suppose that the VC gets all the value V.On the otherhand, denote by 0 < s < I
the proportionof Vthatthe VC would get whenjoining the projectat the laterstage only. To have
the desired trade-off, we require that p > s (otherwise later-stage projects are always more
profitable).0Abstractingfromexit issues, the NPV of an early-stageinvestmentthereforeis [p2-V
- I, -pi] and the NPV of a later-stageinvestmentis [p'sV- I].
Suppose furtherthat the VC wants to exit after the second round; let us denote by A the
probabilityof being able to exit in time (the liquidityrisk), which here (for simplicity) can take
two values, dependingwhetherthe IPO marketis "hot"(h) or "cold"(c). Given this distinction,
we of course have 0 < c < h < 1. Also, let us define the mean of 2 as m (for instance,considerit
as the long-run,averageliquidityrisk). Suppose also thatthe VC can assess the liquidityrisk of
the currentroundbut not beyond. This implies that when investing in a later-stageproject, he
can assess whetherX is h or c but will use the expected value m for any early-stageproject.
In the event thatthe VC faces exit problems(which, in this case, occurswith probability(1 - A
)), he suffersa discount(e.g., a cost of immediacy)of bon the firmvalue. By definition,0 < 3 < 1.
The VC then faces the following tradeoff,with theirrespectiveexpected payoff:
- Invest in an early-stageproject:
- Invest in a later-?tageproject:

p2'V- I, -p, - (1 - m)p2SV
ps V- I, - (1 - i)p-s V

'?Note that finance is committed much longer for early-stage projects. We implicitly assume here that the VC
cannot reinvest the funds from later-stage projects in the next round. A more complete analysis should include
the fact that funds invested in later-stage projects can be redeployed more quickly in new projects. In that case,
it would potentially weaken the results stated here, but not reverse them.

<-----Page 7----->Riskand VentureCapitalFinance
Cumming,Fleming,&Schwienbacher* Liquidity

83

Obviously,theVC will alwayspreferh overc in thecasehe investsin thelaterstageas longas h > c:
p.sV- I - ( - h)p. s V > ps V- I2- (I - c)p- sV.
This means that if it is betterfor the VC to invest in a later-stageprojectunderstate A = c, he
will also prefera later-stageprojectunderA = h. On the otherhand,a preferencefor a later-stage
project under A = h does not imply the same investment decision for A = c. More generally,
investing in an early-stageprojectmay be betterwhenever:
p' V- I - (1 - i)ps V < p2.V-_ I -2

- (1 - m)p2' V

(1)

or, when rearranging:
[p2- V-ps

V] + [(1 - Ai)p.sV- ( - m)p2.SV]- [II - (1 -p)IJ > O

(2)

The two terms in the first squaredbracketsrepresentsthe additionalgains for the VC when
investing in early-stageventures,the terms in the second squaredbracketsis the difference in
cost of immediacy,and the terms in the last squaredbracketsare the additionalinvestmentcosts
when getting involved in the early stage.
For instance, a naturalassumptioncould be that the VC is indifferentbetween an early-stage
and a later-stageinvestmentwhenever there is no fluctuationin the liquidityrisk over time; that
is, wheneverh = c = m. Then, therewould be no incentive to strategicallydiversify the portfolio
among early-stageand later-stageprojectsover time. The condition would then requirethat:
pV(p - s)[

- 6 (1 - m)] = I, - (1 -p)I2

(3)

Suppose now again that h > m > c. In this case, it is straightforwardto check that under
Condition(3) the VC will be betteroff investing in a later-stage(early-stage)projectwhenever
the currentliquidity risk is low (high). This simple frameworkallows us to derive empirical
predictionson the likelihood of investing in early-stageprojects. This can be easily seen after
simplifyingEquation(2), which yields:
p V {p[ - 6 (1 - m)] - s[ - (1 - 6)]} > I - (1 -p)I2

(4)

It follows that investmentin early-stageprojects(with higher technologicalriskp2 instead of
p) is morelikely wheneverliquidityriskis high (A = c) andthe marketvalue of the firm(V) is high.
ThetheoreticalframeworkindicatesthatVCs trade-offliquidityriskagainsttechnologicalriskby
investingmorein early-stageprojectswhen the exit marketsbecome less liquid.On the otherhand,
when liquidity is high, they rush to exit by investing more in expansion-stageand later-stage
projects. Such a strategicbehavior yields a negative relationshipbetween the liquidity of exit
marketsand investmentin new early-stageprojects.Thus,we formulatethe following prediction:
Hypothesis 1 (Effecton New Early-StageInvestments):For new investments,the likelihood
of investing in early-stageprojectsdecreaseswith the liquidityof exit markets.
It is importantto pointout thatrelatedstockmarketvariablesmay leadto alternativepredictions
in regardsto the decision to invest in early-stageprojects.Gompersand Lerner(2000) show that
the supplyof fundsto the VC marketis positively correlatedwith stock marketreturns.As supply

<-----Page 8----->84

increases, the requiredreturnsto new venture projects decrease (the "money-chasingdeals"
phenomenon),andearly-stageprojectsaremorelikely to receive financingin periodsof booming
stock markets. In order to focus on our central issue pertaining to liquidity and early-stage
projectsin a simplemodel,ouranalyticalmodelabstractedfromchangingdealpriceswith different
marketconditions.Withoutexamining the data, one could speculate as to differentpredictions
regardingNASDAQ marketconditionsanddeal prices,which arenot necessarilythe same as the
liquidity effect describedabove. In our empiricaltests, we control for stock marketconditions
(NASDAQ levels), economic growth(real GDP) as well as IPO marketconditionsto study and
control for these differenteffects, and to formallytest our centralhypotheses.
Our second hypothesis concerns the decision whetherto invest in new projects irrespective
of their stage of development.The intuitionis again based on Gompersand Lerner(2000). An
increase in the liquidity of exit marketsincreases the expected returnsto investment.After all,
conditions on exit marketsare highly affected by growth expectationsof the overall economy.
When exit marketsaremore liquid,VCs requirea lower rateof returnon theirinvestments(given
that they then face less risk), thus increasing the pool of projects worth being funded. This
drives up the propensityof VC funds to startnew investments,and should affect all the stages
of development in the same way. Therefore,the likelihood of funding new companies is also
increased, and thus is positively affected by liquidity of exit markets. This is summarizedin
Hypothesis 2:
Hypothesis 2 (Effect on New Investments):The likelihood of investing in new projects
(irrespectiveof theirdevelopmentstage) increaseswith the liquidityof exit markets.
Regardingthe relativeimportanceof early-stageinvestment,notice thatif Hypotheses 1 and 2
holdwe shouldexpectan ambiguouseffecton the overallportfolioof the VC, sincefromHypothesis
1 we should expect a decrease in the fractionof new early-stageprojectswhen liquidity of exit
marketsis high, but Hypothesis 2 would imply more early-stageprojectsin absolutevalue. For
instance, denote by a. the fractionof new projectsin the early stage, where subscripti refers to
the stateof liquidityof exit markets.Thus, i = h when liquidityis high (hot issue market)and i
c if liquidity is low (cold issue market).Denote also by NAthe absolutenumberof new projects
financedand by F the numberof currentfollow-on investments.Then, Hypothesis 1 says thata,l
> aC, while Hypothesis2 says that N, > N . The proportionof new early-stageinvestmentsas
a fractionof all the projectsin the VC's portfoliois then equalto aN [F + NJ, where obviously
this ratiodepends on the state i. Comparingthis ratio for both states h and c shows no clear-cut,
and largely depends on the currentnumberof follow-on investmentsin the overall portfolio of
the VC. Since N,, > N , the minimumthresholdlevel for a,,decreasesby F:"

This means that there are two opposite effects when liquidity risk increases:First, there are
proportionatelymore new early-stageprojects(cf. Hypothesis 1), and second, since VCs invest
in fewer new projects(cf. Hypothesis2), therearemore follow-on projectsin the VCs' portfolio.
The weight of follow-on investments in the overall portfolio will therefore be greaterwhen
"For instance, assume that a, = 0.20, a = 0.5, N, = 10, N = 2, and F is either 5 or 10 (assume also for simplicity
that no follow-on investments are in the early-stage anymore). Then, the condition mentioned above is satisfied
for F = 5, but not F = 10.

liquidity risk is high since fewer new investments are made, while follow-on investments are
often continuedandaremost likely alreadyat the expansionstage andlaterstage of development.
The first two hypothesesare relatedto portfoliocomposition,liquidity,and technologicalrisk.
The lasthypothesispertainsto VC decisionsto potentiallymitigatethese risksthroughsyndication.
The analysisof syndicationis not centralto the theme in the article,but is quitecomplementaryto
the analysisof new versus follow-on investmentand early-stageversuslate-stageinvestmentas it
considerswhetherVCs adjusttheirdeal structuresin responseto liquidityconditions.
Hypothesis 3a (Syndicationfor Diversification Purposes). The syndicate size increases
with the liquidityof exit marketsas a way to diversify the portfolio.
Hypothesis 3b (Syndicationfor Screening Purposes). The syndicate size increases as the
liquidityof exit marketsdecreases in orderto improvethe screeningprocess.
Hypotheses3A and3B provideoppositepredictionsregardingthe effect on the syndicatesize of
the liquidityof exit markets.The effect can be positive for risk diversificationpurposes,or can be
negative to improve the screeningprocess of business plans. In Hypothesis3A, an increase in
liquidityrequiresgreaterportfoliodiversificationif Hypothesis1 holds,since later-stageinvestments
requiregreateramountsof funds.'2This is also what is requiredwheneverVCs are constrainedin
the amountof capitaltheycan investin any singleportfoliocompany(i.e., constrainedby restrictive
covenantsfrom institutionalinvestors;see Gompersand Lerner,1996, 1999). On the otherhand,
Hypothesis 3B conjecturesa negative relationshipthroughscreening effects. More liquid exit
marketsrepresentlowerriskforthe investment,whichweakenstherequirementsforgood screening
and thus weakens the need for syndicatingwith otherVCs as a way to improvethe screeningof
projects(cf. the "secondopinion"rationalementionedby Lerner,1994a,andBranderet al., 2002).
It is worthwhilementioningthatalternativeexplanationsmight exist. For example,therecould
have been a "supply effect" duringthe period of the Interet bubble, given the huge inflow of
money into the venture capital market [see also the related comment above on the "moneychasingdeals"phenomenon(GompersandLerner,2000)]. Therefore,we includevariablesrelated
to generalmarketconditions(NASDAQ, GDP) as controlvariablesin all our regressionsin the
following sections. Moreover,we runrobustnesschecks by excluding the Interet bubbleperiod
from our sample (specifically, excluding years 1999 and 2000), as well as an extra robustness
check excluding 1999 - 2001, since these alternativeexplanationsmay be most relevantduring
those years. Otherrobustnesschecks are provided and discussed in the following sections.

III.Data
In this section, we presentthe data for testing our researchhypotheses. We also analyze how
the investmentbehaviorof VCs evolved over time. Finally,we presentsummarystatisticsof the
data used throughoutthis article.
A. Data Source
The data source considered is the VentureXpertdataset of VentureEconomics. A total of
18,774 investmentrounds(and 4,065 first-roundinvestments)thatspanthe period from January
12An alternative rationale for a positive relationship stems from the often-heard preference of some VCs in bad
times to retain their remaining funds for their own projects. This is very well possible, as raising new funds get
difficult in cold issue markets.

1, 1985 until December 31, 2004 were randomlyselected. The informationavailable for each
portfolio company and each round includes the date of the investment round, its amount, its
stage, the industrysector of the portfolio company, and the number of investors involved in
financingthe given round.The limitationsof these data are discussed in Section V.
The unit of observationsconsideredin this articleis an investmentroundin an entrepreneurial
firm. In our dataset,syndicationdoes not result in additionalrows for the same entrepreneurial
firm, althoughstaging does result in additionalrows (and we check robustnessby considering
only first-roundinvestments).In our dataset,each entrepreneurialfirm has at least one limited
partnershipVC as an investor.We wanted this in orderto be able to focus on the effect of exit
requirements(liquidityrisk) on investmentbehavior,since investmentsof othertypes of VCs do
not necessarilyhave the same need to exit as limited partnershipVCs do. VCs such as corporate
VCs or governmentVCs (Lerner,1999; Gompersand Lerner,1999) often have funds that last
longer thanthe typical 10 years, so thatthe pressureto exit fromtheirinvestmentsis lower. This
inevitablyaffects the impactof liquidityrisk. By limiting the sampleto limitedpartnerships,we
make sure that liquidity (or exit) risk mattersin all our investments.We believe our focus on
limitedpartnershipsallows us to directlyexaminethe issue of liquidityrisk. Therefore,we do not
include fund characteristicvariablesin our empiricalanalyses.13 As discussed below, we did not
find material differences across funds with the exclusion or inclusion of different types of
syndicated funds in the dataset.
We use the definition for investment stages provided by VentureXpert,which distinguishes
between four broad classes of stages:
i. Early Stage: This includes seed, start-upearly, R&D early, other early, first stage, R&D
equity, and other R&D stages.
ii. Expansion Stage: This includes expansion, R&D expansion, and second stages.
iii. LaterStage: This includesthirdstage, bridge,bridgeloan, otherlater-stage,open market
purchase,private investmentin public company,and other expansion stages.
iv. Other Stages (including buyout/acquisition):This includes acquisition, acquisition for
expansion, leverage buyout (LBO), turnaround,special situation,secondarypurchase,VC
partnership,and unknown stages.
In what follows, we will focus the analysis on the first three classes of development, since
these arethe ones thatreally deal with technologicalrisk. Forrobustnesschecks, we alternatively
use a more restrictivesample by comparingearly-stagewith expansion-stageinvestmentsonly.
Note that the last class - the "other stages" - even includes all observations for which no
informationis availableaboutthe investmentstage (this fourthclass representsonly 5.3% of all
the investmentroundsin our sample).In otherwords, when analyzingthe investmentdecision of
'3Thereis one exception to this. We considered including a variable for the proportion of investments from an
investor of a certain type, but found that this did not materially affect the empirical results of interest in our
articlee. We do not report such variables, also in part mainly because it is unclear how the economics of such
variables would work: The minor presence of a syndicated government investor, for example, may have a major
or a minor effect on the investment decision, depending on unobservable factors not picked up by venture
economics (and therefore the appropriate definition of such a variable is at best very unclear). We check the
robustnessof our results to different investor effects by considering a subsampleof the data of limited partnerships
only and non-syndicated investments only. As shown below, the results in this article are robust. In a somewhat
related paper, Cumming, Fleming, and Schwienbacher (2004) consider each investor's effects (where each
syndicated investor is a different row in the data) and study the notion of "style drift" in private equity; the
questions addressed in their paper are from the "fund characteristics"perspective. In this article, we focus on the
entrepreneurcharacteristics(where each row in the data is a different entrepreneur)and macroeconomic variables
to study which types of firms receive venture finance depending on the economic environment.

VCs, we will concentrateon the first three classes (early stage versus either expansion stage or
laterstage), and in some cases (for robustnesspurposes)exclude the thirdclass (so thatwe look
only at early stage versus eitherexpansionstage). Overall,we have a total of 18,774 investment
roundsand 4,065 first-roundinvestments.
B. Definition of Variables
The variablesused in the regressionanalysis are defined in Table I. The main variablesare:
EARLY_STAGEis a dummyvariableequal to one if the consideredinvestmentroundis in the
early stage (otherwise,equalto zero); EXPANSION_STAGEis a dummyvariableequalto one if
the investmentroundis in the expansion stage (otherwise, equal to zero); LATER_STAGEis a
dummy variable equal to one if the investmentround is in the later stage (otherwise, equal to
zero); AMOUNTS is the total amountof funds invested in the given round(in millions of 2000
US$); NBR_INVESTORSgives the numberofVCs involvedin raisingAMOUNTS(thesize of the
syndicatein a given round);NBR_IPO representsthe numberof IPOs in the US duringthe year
in which the investmentroundwas done, as reportedby Jay Ritteron his IPO website (see also
Ritterand Welch,2002, Table 1); NEW_INVESTMENTis a dummyvariableequal to one if the
investment is a first-round investment (otherwise, equal to zero); FOLLOW_ON ( = 1 NEW_INVESTMENT)is a dummyvariableequalto one if the consideredinvestmentroundis a
follow-on investment(otherwise,equal to zero); and GDP representsthe real annualgrowthrate
of the US economy duringthe year in which the consideredinvestmentis done. Finally,we also
include industrydummies in all the regressionsto control for industry-specific(technological)
risk:INTERNET(Internetcommunication,e-commerce,Interet services, Internetsoftwareand
COMPUTER(hardwareandsoftware),BIOTECH(biotechnology),andMEDICAL
programming),
(medicalandhealth-related).
C. Graphical Analysis
Figure 1 shows the numberof observationsavailablein each year for the full sample of 18774
investment rounds, as well as the sample of all new investments (4065 observations). More
generally, it shows the great increase in VC investments duringthe second half of the 1990s,
followed by a sharp decrease after 2000. Not surprisingly,the correlationon an annual basis
between the two dataseries is very strong,namely +93%. When overall investmentincreases,so
do investmentsin new companies.
Figure2 presentsthe total numberof IPOsthattook place in the USA duringthe period 1985 2004. These include IPOs on the NASDAQ, NYSE, andAMEX. In what follows, we use these
data as the liquidity measure of exit markets for VC investments. Notice that using yearly
aggregatevalues of liquidityleadsone to considerthe moregeneralliquidityconditionof markets.
The time series exhibits a strong positive autocorrelation.Figure 2 also highlights the relative
importanceof new early-stage investments as comparedto new investments in the two other
stages.Foreachyear,it shows the ratioof new early-stageinvestmentroundsover new expansionstage andlater-stageinvestmentrounds(= new early-stageinvestmentsin yeart + new expansionstage and later-stageinvestmentsin year t). In otherwords, it representsthe averagenumberof
new early-stageinvestmentsfor everynew expansion-stageor later-stageinvestment;the evidence
shows thatit has been changingconsiderablyover time. For instance,in 1987 VCs invested four
times more often in new early-stageprojectsthanin new expansion-stageprojects,while in 1997
it was only twice as often. Notice thaton an annualbasis the empiricalcorrelationof both series
is -58%, which providespreliminarysupportfor Hypothesis 1.

Figure 3 shows the importance of new (first-round) investments relative to follow-on
investments, irrespectiveof developmentstages. It provides the ratio of new investmentsover
all availabledata.Forinstance,we can see thatin 2001 only 11%of all investmentroundswere in
new projects,while in the late 1990s the figurewas about30%.Whencomparingthese values (on
an annual basis) with the annual number of IPOs, one obtains a correlation of +53%. This
provides preliminaryevidence that is consistent with Hypothesis 2.
Finally,Figure4 presentsthe averagesyndicate size for all first-roundinvestmentseach year,
and again with comparisonsto IPO volume. Averagesyndicate size seems to have been smaller
duringthe 1990s. On the annualbasis, the correlationwith IPOvolume is -62%. Figure4 is thus
consistent with Hypothesis 3.
D. Summary Statistics
PanelsA to C in TableII presentsummarystatistics of the data. Panel A presentsthe data for
new investmentrounds only and for all investmentrounds.A few interestingobservationsare
worthhighlighting.First,a large fractionof first-roundinvestmentroundsare in the early stage,
but this fraction is considerablylower for new and follow-on investmentrounds. Second, the
averagesyndicatesize (NBR_INVESTORS)is smallerfor first-roundinvestmentsrelativeto all
investment rounds (an average of 2.6 investors for the first round, versus 3.6 for all rounds).
Third,22%of all investmentroundsincludedarenew investments.Fourth,regardingdifferences
between industry sectors, note that there are fewer investments in the biotech and medical
sectors than in the Internetand computer sectors. This result is certainly attributableto the
Internetboom at the end of the 1990s, andthe largeproportionof all VC investments.Fifth, note

1 through 3 in TablesV to VII for dependentvariablesEARLY-STAGE,NEW_INVESTMENT,
andNBR INVESTORS,respectively.
The regressions are specified with right-hand-sidevariables for IPO exit marketconditions,
amounts invested, and industry dummy variables. Moreover, we examine the impact of the
NASDAQ Composite Index (denoted by NASDAQ) at the end of the investment year, in
order to control for general marketeffects. We also control for real GDP, since Gompers and
Lerner(1998, 1999) show that general economic conditions (which they also proxied by the
real GDP) impactedsignificantly the flow of capital into the US VC market.Withthe different
right-hand-side variables, our pseudo R2values are not very large (less than 5%), but this is
quite consistent with other papers in venture finance that use similar US industry data (for
example, Cochrane(2005) estimates the determinantsof US VC returnsand explains at most
1%of the variation in the data).
We furtherconsider in the regressions the numberof IPOs per year occurring one and two
years ahead (NBR_IPO(+1) and NBR_IPO(+2)), to capturethe fact that futureliquidity might
matter.By including these two variables,we implicitly assume thatVCs have perfect foresight
concerning the future liquidity of exit markets in the coming two years, which of course is a
very strong assumption. As an alternative specification and robustness check, we estimate
a forecasting model for predicted values of future liquidity. In particular,we use an AR(1)
model to obtain predicted values of NBR_IPO, which we denote by P_IPO (as indicated in
Table I). The estimation equation uses the number of IPOs in the prior year, the average
underpricingof such IPOs in the prior year, and the prior year's real GDP growth to predict

+ 13
,2 *Underpricing(t-1)

Real GDP Growth(t-1)+ 3(t).

In all the tables, we show the regressionresults for testing Hypothesis 1 when using P_IPO
insteadof NBR IPO.
In each regressiontable (TablesV-VII), we consider the effect of droppingyears aroundthe
Internetbubble.Model (11) in eachregressiontableexcludesthe years 1999 and2000. Model (12)
excludes the years 1998-2001. We explicitly show the robustnessof the econometricresults to
the inclusion and exclusion of these outlier years, as well as the consideration of different
explanatoryvariables.Note thatthe graphicalanalysis of the data(Section III.C)shows thatthe
patternsof investmentin relationto economic cycles arenot attributableto the years surrounding
the Interet bubble. We discuss furtherrobustnesschecks not explicitly presentedbut available
upon requestin Section V.
A. Effect of Liquidity Risk on Early-Stage Investments
Table V reports the result of different Logit regressions. The dependent variable is
EARLY_STAGE,a dummyvariableequalto one if the new investmentis in the earlystage andto
zero otherwise.'6Since many of our explanatoryvariables exhibit collinearity,we estimate the
impactin separateregressions.The coefficient of NBR_IPO is negative and significantin all the
regressionsin which it was included, strongly supportingthe predictionstated in Hypothesis 1.
TableV indicatesthat an increase in liquidityby 100 IPOs will reduce the likelihood that a VC
invests in new early-stage projects (as compared to new investments in other development
stages) by approximately1.5% (Models 7 and 8) to 2.3% (Model 9), dependingon the model
specification.The resultsthereforeindicatea clearstatisticallyandeconomicallyimportanteffect
of IPO conditions on the probabilityof early-stageinvestment,particularlyin view of the fact
thatIPO conditionsfluctuatewidely (Bradleyet al., 2003, Helwege andLiang,2002, andLowry,
2003). Note as well thatthe resultsarerobustto the inclusionor exclusion of the Interet bubble
years(1999 and2000 areexcludedfromModel 11, and 1998-2001 areexcludedfromModel 12).
We have stressedthatthe predictedeffect derivedfromour model and statedin Hypothesis1 is
not immediatelyobvious,andis even somewhatcounterintuitive.Ourmodelis largelybasedon the
decision to postponeexit requirementsby undertakingprojectsof greatertechnologicalriskwhen
IPOmarketsareilliquid.One couldjust as easily conjecturethatthereis a positive correspondence
betweenmarketconditionsandearly-stageinvestmentbasedon an oft-repeatedcasualempiricism
(as is often statedin practitionerarticleson, e.g., www.ventureeconomics.com).To this end, we
controlforNASDAQ marketlevels andshow that,indeed,yearsin whichNASDAQ marketlevels
arehigherare consistentwith more early-stageinvestments,both independentof controlsfor IPO
conditions(Model 6) and with controlsfor IPO conditions(Models 8 and 10). An increasein the
NASDAQ compositeindex by 1000 points increasesthe likelihoodof early-stageinvestmentsby
approximately1.6%(Model6) to 2.4%(Model 8), dependingon the specification.
5Forthis specification, we made use of publicly available annual IPO data on Jay Ritter's webpage going back to
1960. These data were used as they comprise a sufficient number of years to obtain reliable estimates of the future
number of IPOs. This procedure is somewhat similar to the alternatives reported in Lowry (2003). We did
consider numerous alternatives, and our predicted IPO numbers did not materially alter the results or qualitative
conclusions presented herein.
'6Throughoutthe article, we test investments in early-stage rounds against investments in either expansion-stage
or later-stage investments. We also tested early-stage investments against expansion-stage investments only and
did not find any significant difference in the results.

The models also generallyindicatea greatereconomic significance in the probabilityof earlystage financingthroughVC funds in biotech and medical industriesrelative to the Internetand
computersectors. One possible explanationis that the different sectors take longer to bring a
projectto fruition(Gompersand Lerner,1999).Anotherexplanationcould be thattheremightbe
less scope for VCs to invest in biotech in orderto trade-offliquidity risk againsttechnological
riskwhenexitmarketsareilliquid.Biotechentrepreneurial
firmstypicallylacktheabilityto internally
fund themselves, and thereforethere is a comparativedearthof expansion-stagebiotech firms
seeking capitalfor the firsttime fromVCs.
Note thatthe largerthe investment(the variableAMOUNT), the lower the likelihood that the
new investmentis an early-stageproject,as would be expected.l7Interestingly,since later-stage
projectsalso involve greateramountsof finance, this suggests that the shift from early stage to
expansionstage inducedby the liquidityof exit marketsis even morepronouncedin dollarvalues
as comparedto the numberof investments.
B. Effect of Liquidity Risk on New Investments
Table VI shows the results of Logit regressions with NEW_INVESTMENTas dependent
variableto test Hypothesis2. To this end, we use the full sample for early-stageand expansionstage projects.'8
The resultsin TableVI providestrongsupportfor Hypothesis2 ("New InvestmentDecision"),
which conjectureda positive effect of IPOvolume on the propensityto invest in new projectsas
a resultof reducedliquidityrisk.An increasein contemporaneousIPO volume by 100 increases
the probabilityto invest in a new project(as opposed to a follow-on project)by approximately
1.2%(Model 1) to 4.1% (Models 7). The estimatedmarginaleffects are slightly smallerfor the
futureIPO variables(Models 2 and 3) and predictedfutureIPO variables(Models 4, 9, and 10).
These resultsare quiterobustto the inclusionof controlvariablesfor GDP (which is positive and
significant,as expected), NASDAQ (positive and significant,as expected, but only in Models 8
and 10), andAMOUNTS (negative and significant,as expected).Further,note thatas in TableV,
TableVI shows that the results are robustto the inclusion or exclusion of the years surrounding
the Internetbubble (Models 11 and 12).
Interestingly,note from Table VI that Internetprojects are more often new investments(as
opposed to follow-on investments). This is consistent with evidence of money-chasing deals
duringboomperiodslikethatof the Interet bubble(GompersandLemer,2000). Thecomparatively
less frequentstagingof Internetprojectsis also consistentwith otherevidence of less value added
andless monitoringprovidedto VCs in boom periods(Gompers,1995;KortumandLerner,2000).
C. Effect of Liquidity Risk on Syndicate

Size

TableVII examines optimal syndicate size in orderto test Hypothesis 3A versus Hypothesis
3B. Weuse NBR_INVESTORSas the dependentvariable,as definedin TableI, anduse a Poisson
regression to account for the ordinal nature of the data.'9The Vuong test statistic strongly
7Weview capital requirementsas exogenously determinedin Models (7)- (10). Numerous alternativespecifications
and assumptions (available upon request) did not materially affect the results.
'Specifications with later-stage investments, which are typically not considered as "venture capital", but rather
"private equity," did not materially affect the results and are available upon request.
'9An ordered Logit model was considered, but yielded estimation problems where there were too few observations
for some of the syndicated investments with a very large number of syndicated partners. Redefining and/or
deleting these problematic observations for that methodology did not yield results that were materially different
from the reported Poisson regression approach. Alternative specifications are available upon request.

supportsthe Poisson specification in all cases. We carry out similar robustness checks as in
Tables V and VI. We also considered alternativespecifications (not reportedin the tables for
reasons of succinctness), such as a dependentvariableequal to one if the deal was syndicated,
and to zero otherwise. Ourresults are robustto this alternativespecification, among others.We
focus on the more intuitivePoisson specification,which accounts for the numberof syndicated
partners,and a declining marginalbenefit of adding additionalsyndicatedpartners.
Table VII shows that the coefficients of the variables NBR_IPO(+n) are again statistically
significant in all the regressions. An increase in IPO volume by 100 gives rise to around0.2
fewer syndicated partnerson average. Thus, greater exit market liquidity reduces syndicate
size. This is very supportive of Hypothesis 3B, which is based on the screening motive for
syndication (described in Section II). This result is also not attributableto the Internetbubble
years, as the results hold for Models 11 and 12, where the years 1999-2000 and 1998-2001 are
excluded, respectively.
In TableVII, note as well that all of the AMOUNTS coefficients are positive and significant,
as expected (greater capital requirementsgive rise to more syndicated partners). Moreover,
the syndicate size is greatest for companies in the biotech sector and smallest for companies
in the Internetsector. These industryeffects are supportiveof the role of exit marketliquidity,
in that technologically riskier sectors with a longer gestation period are financed by larger
investor syndicates.

V. Limitations, Alternative Explanations, and Future Research
The issues considered in this article give rise to a numberof questions and furtherresearch
issues. Oursamplewas based on datafroma randomlyselected groupof limitedpartnershipVCs
in the United States over the period 1985 - 2004. We considereda large numberof robustness
checks, many of which we have provided. An earlier version of this article reported other
robustnesschecks, such as the exclusion/inclusionof Interet firms, and hot and cold markets;
those excludedresultswere very supportiveof the resultsexplicitly reportedherein.In TablesVVII, we showed the robustnessof the resultsto the inclusionand exclusion of the years 1999 and
2000, as well as of the years 1998-2001. We also explicitly showed the robustnessof the resultsto
numerousdifferentexplanatoryvariables.
Thereare other issues that are beyond the scope of this article,but that are relevantto further
research.The following arefive potentialavenuesfor futureresearch.First,it could be instructive
to considerothertypes of investors.Ourdataare derived from VCs only.20In practice,there are
various ways in which entrepreneurscan finance their early-stageinvestmentswithout seeking
VCs, althoughnot all of these sources are available to all entrepreneurs.Often, entrepreneurs
relyon friendsandfamilyto financethe start-upof a company.Othersmayalso obtaingovernmental
subsidies or are able to do R&D in universities before their ventures are spun-off, so that
substantialpartsof theirearly-stagedevelopmentis done withoutany additionalcapitalinjection
from VCs. Many other entrepreneursprefer to work with business angels before approaching
VCs. Empiricalevidence shows thatbusiness angels invest in farmoreprojectsthanVCs do, but
invest a much smalleramount(cf. Prowse, 1998; Freear,Sohl, and Wetzel, 1996; Lerner,1998;
Fenn,Liang,andProwse, 1998;Wong,2002; andChemmanurandChen,2002).:' Therefore,VCs
'0Each transaction comprises at least one limited partnership VC. We did not find material differences across
funds with the exclusion or inclusion of different funds in the dataset.
2'Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel (1996) estimated that about 250,000 angels invest US$ 10-20 billion in around
250,000 companies each year, which is far more than is invested in the VC market. In Europe, the number of
active business angels was estimated by the European Business Angels Network (EBAN) at 125,000.

do not always have to join start-upcompanies in the early stage, but may choose to do so only
in later rounds.Although there is no reason to believe our sample is biased by considering a
sample of VCs only, an analysis of othertypes of investorswould give a more complete analysis
of the effects of liquidityrisk.
Second, there are different definitions of liquidity that could be analyzed. The concept of
liquidity is broaderthan that considered in our article.As mentionedin Section I, the liquidity
concept seems better defined for listed equity than for private equity. On the other hand, the
dimensionwe analyze in this article is arguablythe most appropriateone to focus on in private
equity.For instance, it would be hardto obtain any reasonableproxy for the depthor resiliency
of liquidity for initially non-tradedshares.Anotherpotential limitationis the fact thatwe focus
only on the IPOexit marketandomitthe othermainexit route,namelythe corporateM&A market.
We did considerM&A data,22but this did not improveupon the richnessof the resultspresented
herein.As discussed,VCs and the investees typically have a preferencefor IPO exits (Black and
Gilson, 1998;GompersandLemer,1999).
Third,there are aspects of deal structuresthat could be studied in relationto liquidity other
thanthe ones consideredherein(i.e., our focus was on syndication,in the spiritof Lerner,1994a).
For instance,it could be instructiveto studythe use of covenantsin relationto liquidityconcerns
(e.g., in the spiritof BaschaandWalz,2001), whichmightexplainreporteddifferencesin contractual
termsused in differentcountries.Furtherresearchis warranted.
Fourth,it would be instructiveto investigate the effect of liquidity in relation to legality in
differentcountries(e.g., as in Jeng and Wells, 2000, and Lernerand Schoar,2005). Whetherthe
development of VC marketsis more closely connected to issues of liquidity or legality is an
unansweredquestion worthy of future study.
Finally, the data herein and the asymmetriceffects in particularsuggest the importanceof
behavioralfinance factorsin affecting VC decisions (e.g., see Landierand Thesmar,2003). Our
model was based on rationaldecision-making.While an analysis of VCs in a behavioralsetting
could prove fruitfulin futurework, it is beyond the scope of the article.

VI. Conclusion
This articleputsfortha theoreticalmodel wherebyVCs time theirinvestmentsaccordingto exit
opportunities.When exit marketsbecome less liquid, VCs invest proportionatelymore in new
early-stage projects (relative to new projects in other stages of development) in order to
postpone exit requirementsand thus invest in riskierprojects.As such, VCs trade-offliquidity
risk against technological risk when exit marketslack liquidity. In contrast,when liquidity is
high, VCs invest more in expansion-stage and later-stage projects where time until exit
(investment duration)is reduced.
The US data examined here provide very strong support for the theory. We find a strong
negative relationshipbetween the liquidityof exit marketsandthe likelihoodof investing in new
early-stageprojects.Furthermore,we find thatthe liquidityof exit marketssignificantlyaffects
both the decision to invest in new projectsand the size of the investmentsyndicate.An increase
in liquidityby 100 IPOs in a year reducesthe likelihood of investing in new early-stageprojects
by approximately 1.5% - 2.3%, increases the probabilityof investment in a new project (as
opposedto a follow-onproject)by approximately1.2%- 4.1%,andgives riseto approximately0.2
fewersyndicatedpartners.Thesemarginaleffects areeconomicallymeaningful,dueto themassive
swings in IPO marketcycles (see, e.g., Lowry,2003; RitterandWelch,2002; and Loughranand
Ritter,2004, 2004). We explain the fact thatour findings are remarkablyconsistentwith related
empiricaland theoreticalwork in venturecapital finance over boom and bust periods (see, e.g.,
Kortumand Lerner,2000; Kanniainenand Keuschnigg,2004), and suggest a numberof avenues
for futureresearchon this topic.E
