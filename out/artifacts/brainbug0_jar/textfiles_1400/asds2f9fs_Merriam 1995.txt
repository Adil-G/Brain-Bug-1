What Can You Tell From An
N of I?: Issues of Validity
and Reliability in
Qualitative Research
Sbaran B. Merriam
Abstract
This article deals with the issues of validity and reliability in qualitative research
in education. Philosophical assumptions underlying the concepts of internal
validity, reliability, and external validity or generalizability are discussed. In
addition, strategies congruent with a qualitative research perspective for ensuring
for rigor and trustworthiness of fmdings in qualitative research are presented.

At conference presentations, in reviews of journal articles, at thesis
defenses, the trustworthiness of qualitative research continues to be
challenged, and rightly so. Rigor is needed in all kinds ofresearch to insure
that fmdings are to be trusted and believed. In applied fields like education,
social work, counseling, and administration, the question of the trustworthiness of research fmdings looms large; after all, much research is
designed to understand and improve practice. We want to feel confident
incorporating research findings into our practice, for what we do affects
the lives of real people.
Questions most commonly posed to qualitative researchers reflect
concerns with the validity and reliability of the research fmdingsquestions such as the one in the title of this article, and others such as:
"How can you generalize from a small, non-random sample?" "If
somebody else did this study, would they get the same results?" "How do
you know the researcher isn't biased and just finding what he or she
expects to find?" and "If the researcher is the primary instrument for data

collection and analysis, how can we be sure the researcher is a valid and
reliable instrument?" These questions reflect legitimate concerns about
the rigor of qualitative research; they also reflect philosophical assumptions underlying a quantitative or positivist worldview and are thus
inappropriate for assessing the rigor of a qualitative study. The purpose of
this paper is twofold: (1) to examine conceptions of validity and reliability
from a qualitative or interpretive worldview and (2) to present strategies
for insuring for validity and reliability that are consonant with assumptions
underlying the qualitative paradigm.

Purposes of Qualitative Research
In assessing the trustworthiness of qualitative research, it is important
to back up and ask what kinds ofquestions or problems qualitative research
is designed to address. Qualitative research is ideal for the following:
clarifying and understanding phenomena and situations when operative
variables cannot be identified ahead of time; finding creative or fresh
approaches to looking at over-familiar problems; understanding how
participants perceive their roles or tasks in an organization; determining
the history of a situation; and building theory, hypotheses, or generalizations.
The question of trustworthiness becomes how well a particular study does
what it is designed to do.
Notions of validity and reliability must be addressed from the perspecti ve of the paradigm out of which the study has been conducted. That
is, if I am trying to build hypotheses rather than test them, if I am trying to
understand a phenomenon rather than "treat" it, if I am interested in
participants' perspectives rather than my own, different questions will
need to be asked about the conduct of the study.
Qualitative researchers have approached rigor from one of two
angles. Some layout the standard, positivist threats to validity and
reliability made famous by Campbell and Stanley (1963) and Cook and
Campbell (1979) and demonstrate how qualitative research addresses
these threats. History, maturation, observer effects, selection and regression, mortality, spurious conclusions, and so on, can be addressed from a
qualitative research perspective as demonstrated by Guba and Lincoln
(1981) and Goetz and LeCompte (1984). More commonly, writers make
the case that qualitative research is based on different assumptions
regarding reality, thus demanding different conceptualizations of validity
and reliability. Some have proposed using a different nomenclature. Agar
(1986), for example, talks about credibility, accuracy ofrepresentation,and

<-----Page 2----->53

authority of writer; Guba and Lincoln (1981) suggest credibility, dependability, and transferability.
The position expressed in this paper is that notions of validity and
reliability need to be grounded in the worldview of qualitative research.
Further, there are strategies that can be employed to ensure for trustworthiness that are highly compatible with this world view . The discussion
that follows is presented in terms of the three major aspects of rigor-internal validity, reliability, and external validity (generalizability).

Internal Validity
Internal validity asks the question: How congruent are one's findings
with reality? In quantitative research the question is often more precisely
stated: Are we observing or measuring what we think we are observing or
measuring? Key to understanding internal validity is the notion of reality.
Is reality fixed and stable as the positivists believe, or constructed and
interpreted as qualitative researchers believe? These two views of reality
are eloquently contrasted in Steinbeck's (1941) log of his scientific
journey to the Sea of Cortez:
We knew that what we would see and record and construct would be
warped, as all knowledge patterns are warped, first, by the collective
pressure and stream of our time and race, second by the thrust of our
individual personalities. But knowing this, we might not fall into too
many holes-we might maintain some balance between our warp and
the separate things, the external reality. The oneness of these two
might take its contribution from both. For example, the Mexican
sierra has 'XVII-15-IX' spines in the dorsal fin. These can easily be
counted. But if the sierra strikes hard on the line so that our hands are
burned, if the fish sounds and nearly escapes and finally comes in over
the rail, his colors pulsing and his tail beating the air, a whole new
relational externality has come into being-an entity which is more
than the sum of the fish plus the fisherman. The only way to count the
spines of the sierra unaffected by this second relational reality is to sit
in a laboratory, open an evil smelling jar, remove a stiff colorless fish
from formalin solution, count the spines, and write the truth 'D. XVIII5-IX.' There you have recorded a reality which cannot be assailedprobably the least important reality concerning either the fish or
yourself. It is good to know what you are doing. The man with his
pickled fish has set down one truth and has recorded in his experience

<-----Page 3----->54

Theory to Practice

many lies. The fish is not that color, that texture, that dead, nor does
he smell that way. (p..2)
Steinbeck goes on to say, "We were determined not to let a passion for
unassailable little truths draw in the horizons and crowd the sky down on
us. We knew that what seemed to us true could be only relatively true
anyway. There is no other kind of observation. The man with his pickled
fish has sacrificed a great observation about himself, the fish, and the focal
point, which is his thought on both the sierra and himself' (pp. 2-3).
That reality is what we take to be true, and that it is only relatively true,
is echoed by Ratcliffe (1983) who writes that rules purport to guarantee the
truth of an inquiry have changed over time. Guarantors of validity "are
merely rules that have been made by human beings (inquirers), and they
thus necessarily serve human purposes and goals. Such rules are therefore
inevitably normative: They 'prove' only that we are playing by the
(current) rules" (p. 159).
QUalitative research assumes that reality is constructed, multidimensional, and ever-changing; there is no such thing as a single, immutable reality waiting to be observed and measured. .Thus, there are
interpretations of reality; in a sense the researcher offers his or her
interpretation of someone else's interpretation of reality. Just as in
quantitative research there are things you can do (such as control for
extraneous variables) to ensure that findings are valid according to that
paradigm's notion of reality, so too in qualitative research. The following
strategies can be employed to strengthen the internal validity of a qualitative study. (These strategies and the ones discussed in the next two
sections are drawn from experience and literature, in particular, Guba and
Lincoln, 1981; Merriam, 1988; and Patton, 1991.)
1. Triangulation--the use of multiple investigators, multiple sources
of data, or multiple methods to confirm the emerging findings (Denzin,
1970; Mathison, 1988). For example, if the researcher hears about the
phenomenon in interviews, sees it taking place in observations, and reads
about it in pertinent documents, he or she can be confident that the "reality"
of the situation, as perceived by those in it, is being conveyed as "truthfully" as possible.
2. Member checks--taking data collected from study participants,
and the tentative interpretations of these data, back to the people from
whom they were derived and asking if the interpretations are plausible, if
they "ring true."
3. Peer/colleague examination--asking peers or colleagues to

<-----Page 4----->Merriam

55

examine the data and to comment on the plausibility of the emerging
findings.
4. Statement of researcher's experiences, assumptions, biases-presenting the orientation, biases, and so on, of the researcher at the outset
of the study. This enables the reader to better understand how the data
might have been interpreted in the manner in which they were.
5. Submersion/engagement in the research situation--collecting data
over a long enough period of time to ensure an in-depth understanding of
the phenomenon. Criteria for determining how long is long enough can be
found in Guba and Lincoln (1981), Merriam (1988), and Patton (1991).
Most writers agree that internal validity is a strength of qualitative
research. There are fewer "layers" between the researcher and the
phenomenon under investigation. The strategies described above can help
ensure that the interpretation of "reality" being presented is as "true" to the
phenomenon as possible.

Reliability
Reliability is concerned with the question of the extent to which on~' s
findings will be found again. That is, if the inquiry is replicated, would the
findings be the same? Reliability in the "hard" sciences revolves around
repeated measures of a phenomenon. Typically investigators disassociate
themselves from the phenomenon being investigated by using "objective"
measures. The more times the findings of a study can be replicated, the
more stable or reliable the phenomenon is thought to be. This was
precisely the problem with the cold fusion findings announced by the
University of Utah scientists. Other scientists were unable to replicate
their work; hence, the reliability of the findings of the original investigations were called into question.
In the social sciences the whole notion of reliability in and of itself is
problematic. That is, studying people and human behavior is not the same
as studying inanimate matter. Human behavior is never static. Classroom
interaction is not the same, day after day, for example, nor are people's
understanding of the world around them. Cronbach (1975) notes that "an
acturarial table describing human affairs changes from science into history
before it can be set in type" (p. 123). Further, the scientific notion of
reliability assumes that repeated measures of a phenomenon (with the
same results) establishes the truth of the results. However, measurements
and observations can be repeatedly wrong, especially where human
beings are involved.

<-----Page 5----->56

Theory to Practice

Scriven (1972) makes the point that a lot of people experiencing the
same thing does not necessarily mean that their accounts are more reliable
than that of a single individual. Five hundred people reporting that they
had seen a magician cut a person in half, for example, would not be as,
reliable as a report as that of the lone stagehand who had witnessed the
event from behind the curtain.
Qualitative researchers are not seeking to establish "laws" in which
reliability of observation and measurement are essential. Rather, qualitative researchers seek to understand the world from the perspectives of
those in it. Since there are many perspectives, and many possible
interpretations, "there is no benchmark by which one can take repeated
measures and establish reliability in the traditional sense" (Merriam, 1988,
p. 170). Clearly, replication of a qualitative investigation will not yield the
same results (as it might in quantitative research). Rather, both sets of
results stand as two interpretations of the phenomenon.
Instead of reliability, one can strive for what Lincoln and Guba (1985,
p. 288) call "dependability" or "consistency." The real question for
qualitative researchers, they suggest, is not whether the results of one study
are the same as the results of a second or third study, but whether the results
ofa study are consistent with the data collected. As with internal validity,
there are strategies one can use to ensure for greater consistency. Three
such strategies are listed below:
1. Triangulation--The use of multiple methods of data collection, in
particular, as well as other forms of triangulation, can lead to dependability
or consistency (as well as internal validity).
2. Peer examination-Again, this strategy provides a check that the
investigator is plausibly interpreting the data; that is, someone else can be
asked whether the emerging results appear to be consistent with the data
collected.
3. Audit trail--This strategy, suggested by Guba and Lincoln (1981),
operates on the same premise as when an auditor verifies the accounts of
a business. "In order for an audit to take place, the investigator must
describe in detail how data were collected, how categories were derived,
and how decisions were made throughout the inquiry" (Merriam, 1988, p.
172). Goetz and LeCompte (1984) suggest that the audit trail should be so
detailed "that other researchers can use the original report as an operating
manual by which to replicate the study" (p. 216).
Reliability, then, cannot be thought of in qualitative research in the
same way as it is in positivist research. The logic of reliability in
quantitati ve research is based on philosophical assumptions and a worldview

<-----Page 6----->Merriam

57

different from that of qualitative research. What one strives for is
consistency and dependability, a sort of internal reliability in which the
findings of an investigation reflect, to the best of the researcher's ability,
the data collected.

External Validity
The extent to which the findings of a study can be applied to other
situations refers to the question of external validity, or generalizability.
Indeed, this question seems to haunt qualitative research more than any
other, probably because most people think of generalizability in the
statistical sense of extrapolating from a sample to a population. Since
qualitative researchers rarely select a random sample (which would then
allow them to generalize to the population from which the sample was
selected), it is thus concluded that one cannot generalize in qualitative
research. However, even generalizability in the statistical sense has its
limitations. First, although random sampling may have been used,
generalizations are made within certain levels of confidence. Outlying
scores are ignored (they become part of the variance). Second, when
dealing with human beings, it is difficult, if not impossible, to apply
statistically-based generalizations to individual persons. For example, a
study might find that 70% of the surgeons in the Northeast voted Republican
in the last election.. But any individual surgeon, say a Dr. Jones, will have
voted not 70% Republican, but either 100% Republican or 100% Democrat.
Third, several writers have pointed out that very little social science
research is based on true random sampling of a population; most populations
from which samples are selected are confined to small geographic areas,
homogenous groups, or highly defined subgroups (middle-school principals
in a single state, for example).
While some qualitative researchers view generalizability as a limitation
of the method, or just not appropriate for the social sciences, most prefer
to think of generalizability as something different than going from a
sample to a population. The goal of qualitative research, after all, is to
understand the particular in depth, rather than finding out what is generally
true of many. There are at least three alternative conceptions of
generalizability that are congruent with the philosophical assumptions
underlying qualitative research. Cronbach (1975) thinks that empirical
generalizations are too lofty a goal for social science research; rather, we
should think in terms of working hypotheses. He writes: "Instead of
making generalization the ruling consideration in our research, I suggest

<-----Page 7----->58

Theory to Practice

that we reverse our priorities. An observer collecting data in one particular
situation is in a position to appraise a practice or proposition in that setting,
observing effects in context. ..Generalization comes late ...When we give
proper weight to local conditions, any generalization is a working hypothesis, not a conclusion" (pp. 124-125). Working hypotheses reflect situation-specific conditions of a particular context. They can also be used to
guide practice (Patton, 1991).
A second concept, called concrete universals, has been proposed by
Erickson (1986). In attending to the particular, universals can be discovered.
Concrete universals are based on the notion that particular situations
convey insights that transcend the situation from which they emerge. The
general lies in the particular. This is, in fact, how human beings make sense
out of their world, how they cope with new situations. What is learned in
a particular situation is applied to similar situations subsequently encountered. For example, a person who receives a speeding ticket on a
particular highway will most likely "generalize" to subsequent instances
of being on the same road and to other similar roads. People do not wait
until they have a sample of experiences before they generalize to new
situations.
A third way of viewing external validity is something becoming
known as readeror usergeneralizability. In this view, the extent to which
findings from an investigation can be applied to other situations is
determined by the people in those situations. It is not up to the researcher
to speculate how his or her findings can be applied to other settings; it is
up to the consumer of the research. Wilson (1979) suggests the notion of
"a continuum of usefulness" beginning on one end representing "the
setting where the information was gathered and stretching to dissimilar
settings" (p. 454).
Whether one thinks of generalizability in terms of working hypotheses, concrete universals, or user generalizability, there are strategies one
can employ to strengthen this aspect of rigor in qualitative research. Four
such strategies are discussed below:
1. Thick description--This involves providing enough information!
description of the phenomenon under study so that readers will be able to
determine how closely their situations match the research situation, and
hence, whether findings can be transferred.
2. Multi-site designs--The use of several sites, cases, situations,
especially those representing some variation (Glaser & Strauss, 1967),
will allow the results to be applied to a greater range of other similar
situations.

<-----Page 8----->Merriam

59

3. Modal comparison--This strategy involves describing how typical
the program, event, or sample is compared with the majority of others in
the same class. In Wolcott's (1973) case study of a school principal, for
example, he tells the reader how representative his subject is compared to
the typical school principal.
4. Sarnpling within--A phenomenon being studied may have numerous component parts (teachers, administrators, students in a school system, for example), each of which could be randomly sampled for inclusion
in the study. This would allow one to "generalize" to the larger group
within the unit of study.
In summary, external validity or generalizability seems to be most
problematic for those not well acquainted with qualitative research. To
consider generalizability a limitation of this kind of research is to be
thinking in terms of statistical generalization based in the quantitative
paradigm. By viewing external validity from the perspective of the
assumptions underlying qualitative research, several reformulations of
generalizability are possible, such as working hypotheses, concrete universals, and reader or user generalizability.

What Can You Tell From An N Of 1?
Viewed from a qualitative perspective, quite a bit can be learned from
an N of 1. The trustworthiness of the findings of a study with a small N
and no random sampling are dependent upon the internal validity, reliability,
and external validity of the study. As was discussed in this article, there
are ways to view each of these concerns that are congruent with the
underlying assumptions and worldview of qualitative research. Likewise,
there are strategies that investigators can employ that will ensure for the
validity and reliability of the study. Rigor is as valid a concern in
qualitative research as in any other kind of research. Qualitative researchers
employ different means of "persuading" the reader that a study is trustworthy. This is what Firestone (1987) calls the "rhetoric" of this research.
While "the quantitative study must convince the reader that procedures
have been followed faithfully because very little concrete description of
what anyone does is provided," qualitative research persuades through its
"classical strengths" of "concrete depiction of detail, portrayal of process
in an active mode, and attention to the perspectives of those studied" (pp.
19,20).
