monitoring from structures sensitive to errors and
omission of reward (1, 4). Although in humans this
view is still under debate (11, 13, 21), the present
meta-analysis does not provide unequivocal evidence
for or against such a dissociation. Activations related
to pre-response conflict and uncertainty occur more
often in area 8 and less often in area 24 than do
signal increases associated with errors and negative
feedback (area 8, 32.5% versus 9.7%; area 24, 7.5%
versus 25.8%), supporting the dissociation view.
However, both groups of activations cluster primarily
in area 32 (pre-response, 42.5%; error, 41.9%),
suggesting that pre- as well as post-response
monitoring processes share at least one underlying
structure. It seems that the currently available spatial
resolution in fMRI, in conjunction with anatomical
variability and differences in scanning and preprocessing methods between studies, limit the ability to
resolve this debate about a possible dissociation in
the range of 10 mm or less.

REVIEW

Neuroeconomics: The Consilience of
Brain and Decision
Paul W. Glimcher1* and Aldo Rustichini2
Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a single, unified
discipline with the ultimate aim of providing a single, general theory of human
behavior. This is the emerging field of neuroeconomics in which consilience, the
accordance of two or more inductions drawn from different groups of phenomena,
seems to be operating. Economists and psychologists are providing rich conceptual
tools for understanding and modeling behavior, while neurobiologists provide tools
for the study of mechanism. The goal of this discipline is thus to understand the
processes that connect sensation and action by revealing the neurobiological
mechanisms by which decisions are made. This review describes recent developments in neuroeconomics from both behavioral and biological perspectives.

long it takes, until the coin lands heads up.
We can assess the average objective, or
expected, value of this lottery by multiplying
the probability of a win on each flip by the
amount of that win:

behavior followed by a bottom-up

This simple calculation reveals that the
expected value of the lottery is infinite even
though the average person is willing to pay
less than /40 to play it. How could this be?
For an economist, any useful explanation
must begin with a set of assumptions that
renders behavior formally tractable to coherent theoretical and mathematical analysis.
Economists therefore explain this behavior
by assuming that the desirability of money
does not increase linearly, but rather grows
more and more slowly as the total amount at
stake increases. For example, the desirability
of a given amount might be a power function

subjective value, or utility, of money grew
in this fashion would then determine the
desirability, or expected utility, of the St.
Petersburg lottery by multiplying the probability of a win on each flip by the utility of
the amount won on that flip, and thus he
might well be willing to pay less than /40 to
play this game.
From the point of view of a psychologist
attempting to understand and explain this
same phenomenon, it is the nature of risk
aversion and the psychological mechanisms
that this set of preferences reveals that
become the subject of explanatory study.
The psychological mechanism that accounts
for risk aversion in human subjects, for
example, has been shown to be more
sensitive to monetary losses than to monetary gains. Further, psychologists have suggested that subjective utilities are computed
with regard to somewhat arbitrary and
idiosyncratic monetary reference points, or
frames, set by yet other psychological processes (3). Psychologists use observations
like these to argue that human choosers are
endowed with a particularly strong fear of
losses and that they weigh the merits of all
possible gains and losses relative to a
psychological benchmark: The psychological
approach seeks empirically to describe minimally complex behavioral tendencies, modules, or heuristics that can account for the
actions of human choosers.
A traditional neurobiological perspective
uses yet another approach: A hungry bird is
shown a tray that contains five millet seeds
and repeatedly permitted to fly to the tray
and eat the seeds. At a neurobiological level,
the study of this behavior begins with the
assumption that the visual stimulus of the
five seeds must somehow propagate through
the sensory system of the animal to trigger
activation in orienting circuits that move the
bird to the seeds. Next, the same bird is
permitted to fly to a second tray covered by a
piece of paper. When the bird displaces the
cover, half of the time it reveals 12 seeds and
half of the time it reveals nothing. Mechanistically, the visual stimulus must again
trigger an orienting response, and presumably in this case the strength with which
visual signals connect synaptically to the
orienting circuits reflects both the number of
seeds that the bird earns and the likelihood
that seeds will be found under the paper.
Lastly, both trays are presented, and the bird
is observed to fly toward the tray that may
contain 12 millet seeds. A standard neurobiological explanation (4, 5) presumes that
under these circumstances the two different
behavioral circuits compete. In this case the
synapses that elicit an orienting response to
the covered tray are stronger and thus control

behavior. The neurobiological explanation
specifies the minimal neural circuitry required to account for the observed behavior
of the bird.
What is striking about explanations of
choice behavior by economists, psychologists, and neurobiologists is the different
levels at which they operate. The economic
approach attempts to describe globally all
choice behavior with a single logically consistent formalism. The psychological approach examines the ways in which
subjective and objective estimates of value
differ and posits psychological modules that
can account for these observed behavioral
preferences. The neurobiological explanation
starts with the simplest possible neural

circuitry that can account for the simplest
measurable elements of behavior. It seems
obvious that these different levels of explanation should be linked, but how can such a
linkage be accomplished? We argue that a
unified explanation of decision-making is
not only possible but has recently begun and
that, when the linkage between these three
levels of explanation has matured, a new,
more powerful decision science rooted in a
neuroeconomic approach will have been
developed.
A second claim we will make is that once

aspects of human behavior, aspects that

that a decision science that simultaneously
engaged all three approaches would be more
heavily constrained and at the same time
would have much greater explanatory power
than do any of these three approaches
operating alone. We will see examples of
how this synthetic approach would operate in
principle and early attempts at synthetic
solutions below.
This reconstruction of the study of decision is also going to be the appropriate
basis for a more ambitious theory that explains not just how we make decisions but
why. That such an explanation is necessary
and possible is indicated by the fact that
fundamental features of decision making are
common to many species. For example, risk
aversion as shown by the St. Petersburg
paradox has been described in many species.
Studies of birds making choices in risky
environments produce a behavior best described by a utility function (Fig. 1) (6, 7).
We know that humans and birds deviated
from a common reptilian ancestor at least
200 million years ago, but this basic function
for choice has remained essentially unchanged. Such commonalities make a clear
suggestion: A utility function of this type
probably is an efficient and evolved feature
of vertebrate choice. For example, Robson
(8) provides a justification of why a utility
function might be an evolutionary optimal
response to changing environments. Just as
information theory was used by Barlow (9)
to explain why animals as diverse as horseshoe crabs and cats use similar encoding
schemes in their visual systems, an economic theory that relates utility to Darwinian fitness must serve as an overarching tool for
understanding vertebrate choice behavior.

Linking the Decision Sciences
Subjective desirability. The central concept
in modern economic theory is the notion of
subjective utility: Preferences must be described as subjective properties of the
chooser. Surprisingly, the notion that preferences are represented in the nervous system,
that these preferences are subjective, and
that they guide the production of action has
only recently entered the neurobiological
mainstream. We believe that this has been a
critical flaw in neurobiological studies, because it is essential that economics, psychology, and neuroscience acknowledge a
common phenomenological base to achieve
a reductive unification of the decision sciences. The concepts that guide the behavioral study of decision-making must also
guide the mechanistic study of that process.
In part, this preference-free approach
may have arisen from neurobiology’s roots
in the stimulus-response physiology of the

cortex (DLPFC, associated with goal maintenance and executive control), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, associated with
detection of cognitive conflict). Also significant is the correlation of activation with
choices: An activation of the AI is positively correlated with rejection, suggesting that an emotional arousal associated
with a low offer is correlated with rejection. The overall picture is that offers we
might consider unfair may activate emotional circuits of the brain involved in the
decision to reject an offer. If we can come
to more fully understand how these circuits reach this conclusion, then a behavior that was difficult for classical game
theory to predict may become fully explicable with the synthetic approach that neuroeconomics provides.
A similar line of investigation has examined interplayer cooperation during single
rounds of the trust game. In this game, two
players move sequentially. The first player
can decide to transfer a sum of money out of
an initial endowment that she receives into
an investment pool that immediately triples
in value. The second player then gains control of the investment and can divide it between the two players in any way he chooses.
In this game, the only Nash equilibrium
choice for the first player is to transfer
nothing into the investment. Were she to
make any transfer, the second player should
take all of the money for himself. However,
in real experiments the first player typically
does transfer a significant amount into the
investment, and the second player reciprocates by returning part of the pool. McCabe
et al. (49) had subjects play the trust game
both against a human opponent and against
a computer program which, they were told,
would play a human-like strategy. Under
these conditions McCabe and colleagues
found that subjects were more likely to
cooperate with real humans than with computers and that cooperators have a significantly different brain activation in the two
conditions. Cooperation is associated with
activation of the anterior paracingulate cortex, a brain region associated with (50, 51)
interpreting and monitoring the mental state
of others.
Although these studies are in their early
stages, they suggest the existence of specific
brain components that make specialized
contributions to decision making. The challenge that these studies face is to derive
detailed computational models of the neural
mechanisms, which will make neuroeconomic models broadly predictive as well as
explanatory.

Summary
Economics, psychology, and neuroscience
are converging into a single, unified field

452

aimed at providing a theory of human
behavior. In this enterprise, the method and
the standard set by neuroscience is the final
goal: a reconstruction of the process and
mechanism that goes from a stimulus presented to the subject to his final action in
response. Economics provides the conceptual structure and the object of the analysis. In
this emerging view, people are seen as
deciding among options on the basis of the
relative desirability of each option. This is
true when they are in isolation as well as
when they are in strategic (interaction with
few persons) and market (interaction with a
large number) environments. The recent
research we have been surveying describes
how desirability is realized as a concrete
object, a neural signal in the human and
animal brain, rather than as a purely theoretical construction. Desirability is computed
and is represented in the brain, and we now
have the means to test, measure, and represent this activation.
But the complete reconstruction of the
decision process, and hence of human
behavior, is not going to be easy, because
two of the cornerstones of economic
analysis, subjective utility theory and Nash
equilibrium, provide, even from the descriptive point of view, an incomplete
picture. For example, desirability as represented by the simple economic formalism
of expected utility may be appropriate only
in simple conditions, where ambiguity is
excluded. A more general notion is needed
and, as we have seen, is beginning to be
investigated and developed by psychologists and economists working together. The
goal of the emerging neuroeconomic program will have to be a mechanistic,
behavioral, and mathematical explanation
of choice that transcends the explanations
available to neuroscientists, psychologists,
and economists working alone. Although it
is unclear today how complete this explanation will ultimately be, neuroeconomic
approaches have already begun to yield
substantial fruit and to fuse natural and
social scientific approaches to the study of
human behavior.
