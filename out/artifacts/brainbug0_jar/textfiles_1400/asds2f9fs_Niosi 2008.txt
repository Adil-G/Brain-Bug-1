ounded in 1972, the Institute for Research on
Public Policy is an independent, national,
nonprofit organization.

IRPP seeks to improve public policy in Canada by
generating research, providing insight and sparking
debate that will contribute to the public policy
decision-making process and strengthen the quality of
the public policy decisions made by Canadian
governments, citizens, institutions and organizations.
IRPP's independence is assured by an endowment fund
established in the early 1970s.

Introduction
nnovation, particularly in science and technology, is the
engine of economic growth (Rosenberg 2004). This idea
was Robert Solow’s contribution, for which he received a
Nobel Prize in economics in 1987. Since then, many national
and international studies have confirmed his thesis. Economies
grow through the adoption of technological innovations, more
than through the incorporation of such inputs as capital and
labour. Technological innovation accounts for well over 50
percent of economic growth in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (Pianta 1995).
This occurs in two ways: productivity increases as a result of
the wide adoption of new technologies, and new industrial
products and sectors are created (Saviotti and Pyka 2004).
Universities are essential contributors to technological innovation. They train the labour force and create
human capital. As a result of their research activities,
new areas are explored, the frontiers of knowledge are
pushed forward and sometimes even the foundations of
new industries are laid. Yet the channels through which
knowledge flows from universities to the economy and
back are not well understood.
Among OECD countries, Canada ranks high with
regard to funding university research and the number
of graduates in the natural sciences and engineering,
as well as on some raw indicators of outcomes, such
as academic publications. Although some improvements can be made on the supply side, the main problems lie on the demand side. It is far from clear
whether these investments in academic research are
bearing fruit in terms of improved business performance and productivity. There are relatively few hightechnology and science-based companies in Canada.
And there is a common perception that Canada lags
behind in terms of the commercialization of research,
and in productivity.

<-----Page 5----->Hypothesis and Research
Questions
n this paper, I will examine the different channels
of technology transfer and compare their contribution in Canada with their contribution in other
industrial nations. I will try to answer the following
questions:
• How effectively do Canadian academic institutions
transfer technology to industry?
• How do Canadian institutions compare with other
advanced nations in terms of technology production (for example, scholarly publications, patents
and licenses)?
• What new sectors and technologies do Canadian
universities create, and how do these compare with
those created by their foreign counterparts?
• What are the bottlenecks in university-industry
technology transfer in Canada? Are these bottlenecks similar to those in other industrial nations?
• Can university-industry technology transfer be
improved through policies, and if it can, should these
policies focus on the supply or the demand side?

I

National Systems of Innovation
he production, diffusion, adoption and mastering of technology are most often achieved by
industrial firms, but they require a complex
institutional and policy environment in order to conduct research and development (R&D) and innovate.
This environment — these institutions and policies —
are called national systems of innovation (NSIs). NSIs
are policies, institutions and organizations devoted to
the production and diffusion of new and improved
science and technology within the boundaries of
states (Lundvall 1992; Nelson 1993; Niosi 2000a;
Niosi et al. 1993). Today, the governments of most
industrial and some industrializing countries employ
the NSI approach in their innovation policies.
Several aspects of the NSI approach need to be
outlined. Linkages among the innovators (the focal
elements, or nodes, which include research universities, government laboratories and innovative firms)
are key. These relationships include personal and
financial knowledge and regulation flows among the
nodes (Niosi et al. 1993). Most important among
these linkages are the interactions between producers
and users of innovations, in particular, those between

IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008

T

universities, government laboratories and industry
(Lundvall 1992). Interaction between the users and
the producers is vital because users are among the
main sources of ideas for innovation among producers. All of the nodes in the system produce knowledge, and some of them, particularly industrial firms,
are also the main users of this technology. The efficiency and effectiveness of the system are heavily
dependent upon the fluidity of the linkages, particularly knowledge transfers, between the nodes of the
system (Niosi 2002). Thus, the interaction between
firms and university and government researchers
should send clear signals to the researchers as to the
likelihood that a university invention will be commercially useful to the industry.

The role of universities
Universities are central components of the NSI. They
create human capital, without which existing technology cannot be absorbed and adapted (Lau 1996).
While traditional, low-growth industries demand less
education, in the fast-growing new economy of the
information technologies — pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology, advanced materials and aerospace
industries — universities provide the high skills
required. In many of these science-based industries,
key knowledge is thus created in universities and
government laboratories and then transferred to business (Niosi 2000b). Further, in any type of industry,
higher education increases the capacity of organizations to adopt high technology and use it efficiently
(Lim 1999).
Universities move the frontier of science forward
by means of advanced research, and they transfer the
results of this activity to industry and society through
different channels (see appendix 1 for a more complete list of the channels). Among these channels are:
• University graduates who move into industry
• Publications and presentations at academic conferences and industrial meetings
• Research contracted by industry or government to
university researchers
• Industry and government consulting work done by
university professors
• University professors moving from university to
industry, for short or long periods;
• Scientific instruments developed in universities
and then adopted and diffused by industry
(Rosenberg, 1994)
• The creation of university-industry research corporations (such as the Canadian Microelectronics
4

<-----Page 6----->5

and Jiang 2007). Some universities, such as the
Massachussetts Institute of Technology in the United
States and Chalmers University in Sweden, are presented as models of institutions that promote economic
development by means of the creation of new firms
(Agrawal and Henderson 2002; Jacob, Lundqvist and
Hellsmark 2003; O’Shea et al. 2007).

A Framework for Understanding
the Stages of Innovation
everal authors have mapped the various phases
and stages in the innovation process. Figure 1
presents one model that is particularly useful in
the Canadian context. The process starts with the first
stage, research, which is followed by the second, centred on invention, and the third, focused on early-stage
technology development. The fourth stage is product
development, and the fifth production and marketing.
The first and second stages I will refer to as the
“supply side” of innovation, because this is where
ideas are organized into useful concepts, research and
discovery. Because the economic value of any given
new idea (or group of ideas) is difficult to predict,
businesses left to themselves would underfund investments in the supply of innovation. For this reason,
governments play a large role in funding (through
public and corporate granting councils, governmentfunded laboratories and, to a lesser extent, angel
investors)1 and universities play a relatively large role
in performing the research. As will be seen later,
Canadian policies seem to be slightly biased toward
the supply side.
The fourth and fifth stages can usefully be termed
the “demand side” of innovation, which is when the
commercial potential of basic research and inventions
is exploited. Here, the business value of an innovation
has been validated, production applications and enduser markets have been clearly identified, and financing has been obtained from venture capital, business
equity and commercial debt. With well-functioning
capital markets, there should be little or no need for
government assistance.
The third stage — which is the grey area between the
supply and demand for innovation — has sometimes
been called “the valley of death,” because it is funded
only laterally and scantily, in both the US and Canada.
But the problems go well beyond funding: there is
often a mismatch between expectations on the demand

• The establishment of industry-supported education
programs
• Academic personnel teaching in industry
• Joint research projects, such as National Centres of
Excellence and research alliances
• Academic spinoffs, patenting, and licensing of
university technology to industry.
Researchers have highlighted the impact of academic research on industrial innovation for over two
decades. In a pioneering study in the United States,
Jaffe found that university R&D had a positive
impact on industry R&D, particularly in such areas as
drugs and medical technology, electronics, optics and
nuclear technology (1989). He attributed this effect to
knowledge spillovers from university to industry. He
suggested that academic research induced industrial
R&D in the same disciplines. Yet he did not try to
understand the organizational issues and transfer
mechanisms by which academic research spills over
and benefits industrial research.
Similarly, Edwin Mansfield, another pioneering
scholar who systematically studied the relationships
between academic research and industrial innovation
in the United States, found that in seven industries
(pharmaceuticals, instruments, information processing
equipment, electronics, metals, petroleum and chemicals manufacturing) some 11 percent of the products
and 9 percent of the processes could not have been
developed without university research (1995).
Mansfield found that larger firms benefited the most
from academic research. Similarly, Cohen, Nelson and
Walsh (2002) found that research performed in universities and government laboratories in the US had a
major impact on a small number of industries, including pharmaceuticals, glass products, electronics, aerospace and chemicals. They also found that the
channels through which technology was tranferred
between public and private organizations were both
open and codified (publications and conferences) and
personal (meetings, consulting and research contracts).
In Canada, an econometric study has estimated
that the C$5 billion invested in university research in
1993 increased the gross domestic product (GDP) by
over C$15 billion annually, largely through its positive impact on business innovation (Martin and
Trudeau 1998).
In the last 10 years, much attention has been
focused on entrepreneurial universities, that is, those
that nurture new spinoff firms (Rothaermel, Agung

side and motivation on the supply side. From the perspective of business, investing in early-stage technologies is risky, because it is difficult and potentially
costly to assess their commercial viability. From the
perspective of academia, scholars are primarily motivated by a desire to publish in scholarly journals, for
which commercial viability is typically not as important as the originality of the discovery. This disconnect between supply and demand of innovation is a
major obstacle to effective university-industry technology transfer.

Canada also ranks high in terms of business funding as a percentage of all academic research (table 2).
In 2004, businesses funded 8.2 percent of university
research (much of which takes the form of industryfunded contracts for specific academic projects). This
proportion was the fifth-highest among OECD countries and was considerable larger than the proportions
of its major trading partners (the United States, the
United Kingdom, Japan, and France). One might
expect that the fact that industry has a significant
Table 1

and Technology
he supply of science and technology by universities, unlike the supply of countable goods such
as automobiles, cannot be measured directly.
Nevertheless, through indirect indicators we can
sketch a partial picture of it, and Canada scores well
on some, but by no means all, of these indicators.
Canada is second among OECD countries in terms
of its expenditure on university research and development as a percentage of its GDP (table 1). This figure reached 0.70 percent in 2004; it was second only
to Sweden’s and nearly double that of the United
States. More significantly, this share has increased
steadily from only 0.44 percent in 1997, as successive
governments have injected more money into the
granting councils.

Connecting the Dots between University Research and Industrial Innovation, by Jorge Niosi

financial stake in university-performed research
would indicate that technology transfer channels are
well developed, but as I will show later, in Canada
this is not necessarily the case.
Canada has a fairly high ratio of university graduates in natural sciences and engineering (NS&E)
There were 7.1 bachelor’s NS&E degrees awarded in
Canada per 100 24-year-olds, more than in the
United States and the sixth-highest among major
industrialized nations (table 3).2 However, NS&E
degrees account for only 23.8 percent of total
degrees awarded in Canada. By this metric, Canada’s
ranking falls to ninth. To the extent that technology

is transferred to industry through the knowledge and
training of NS&E graduates, Canada appears to be
competitive internationally.
Canada also scores reasonably well in terms of
scholarly publications per capita. In fact, it is eighth in
the world on this indicator, ahead of the United States,
Germany and France, but below Switzerland, Sweden
and other Nordic nations (table 4). Publications are
widely considered one of the most important channels
of technology transfer, and here again Canada appears
to perform respectably.
Finally, in the area of university spinoffs (a more
direct indicator of commercially useful academic
research), Canada lags behind the United States, which is
often considered a model in terms of new firms founded
on the basis of academic research. In its most recent survey of technology licensing, the Association of
University Technology Managers (AUTM) reported that
the 189 US universities that responded to their survey
had launched 628 startups in 2005, an average of 3.3
startups per university (AUTM 2007a). In the comparable
Canadian survey, the 34 universities that responded
reported just 36 startup companies (AUTM 2007b).3
University spinoffs are highly concentrated in technical services fields. Forty-one percent of university
spinoffs were in the scientific R&D services industry —
most often related to biotechnology — and computer
systems design. In terms of manufacturing, the most
frequently reported spinoffs were in measuring, medical
and controlling devices and medical equipment and
supplies manufacturing, but taken together these
account for under 5 percent of spinoffs (table 5).
This concentration is consistent with the evidence
from other OECD nations: in the last 20 years these

nations have witnessed a surge in the number of university patents, licences, academic spinoffs, and
university-industry research corporations and collaboration, but this surge was generally concentrated in
biotechnology, information technologies, and materials (Mowery et al. 2001).
It is important to emphasize the fact that the vast
majority of Canadian university technology comes
from the largest research universities (table 6). These
25 institutions (defined as those with at least $80 mil-

lion worth of sponsored research annually) account
for 85 percent of all university inventions, over 90
percent of patents granted to universities, 95 percent
of intellectual property royalties and 78 percent of
spinoff companies. The relative concentration of university-developed technologies reduces the number of
relationships that businesses must develop to access
academic knowledge. At the same time, these elite
institutions are located in 16 different census metropolitan areas, so the supply of university-developed
technologies is well distributed across Canada.
Yet, in spite of its outstanding performance along
many of these supply-side dimensions, Canada is host
to a surprisingly low number of large high-technology and science-based companies. For instance, on the
2006 Fortune Global 500 list of the world’s largest
corporations, only 13 are Canadian and of these only
3 are technology-intensive: Bombardier, Magna and
Nortel. In Canada, many high-technology companies
are created, but few of them reach a large size. This
dampens the demand for university technology
through all its channels.
Also, Canadian productivity has lagged in recent
years, compared with both that in the past and that of
the United States. In the 2000s, US productivity growth
has accelerated relative to the 1990s to reach an average of 2.9 percent per year, while Canadian productivity growth decelerated sharply to just 1 percent
annually. As a result, Canadian productivity levels
(measured as GDP per hour worked) slipped from the
82-to-84-percent range in the 1990s to 74 percent by
2006 (Centre for the Study of Living Standards 2007).
Large firms are much more productive than small ones
(Gu and Tang 2004; Lee and Tang 2001), and Canada
has a disproportionately high proportion of small
firms. Thus, in spite of Canada’s high rank in the raw
quantity of academic research, there is ample room for
improvement with regard to its contribution to better
business productivity and innovative products.
It is clear from the above that the supply side of
academic research is reasonably healthy, particularly
with regard to the financial resources devoted to university research. This is not surprising, because historically the policy and research focus has been
almost exclusively on promoting and funding basic
academic and government research. What is less
healthy is the efficacy with which universitygenerated knowledge reaches the demand side —
whether due to inadequate demand, bottlenecks in
technology transfer or mismatches in supply and
demand.

Connecting the Dots between University Research and Industrial Innovation, by Jorge Niosi

ome demand factors have been closely studied.
Canada’s domestic market is relatively small
compared with those of its major competitors,
such as the United States, the European Union, Japan
and, more recently, China. Its domestic market is
scattered over 27 metropolitan areas in a very large
territory, which affects transportation and communication costs, as well as the transmission of knowledge
externalities among universities, public laboratories
and business. These universities are located in such
places as Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria. This
large geographical spread has advantages — each
large city has at least one university — and disadvantages — cooperation among universities is difficult.
Because industry is the main user of universitydeveloped technology, countries with high levels of
business expenditures on R&D (BERD) should experience stronger demand for university technology than
those with lower BERD intensity. Canada’s BERD
intensity is relatively low compared with those of the
largest OECD countries, and is lower than the OECD
average (table 7), suggesting that industrial demand
for academic knowledge in Canada is lower than it is
in Canada’s main competitors, including the United
States, Japan, Germany and France. Canada hosts
many resource-intensive industries whose firms have
low or medium R&D intensity, and this is one of the
reasons for Canada’s poor aggregate performance.
However, ab Iorwerth (2005) compared the R&D
intensity in specific industries in Canada and the
United States and concluded that Canada’s lower
BERD intensity is due mainly to lower R&D intensity
in selected large industries (particularly automobile
manufacturing and the service sector) as opposed to

differences in industrial structure. Furthermore, key
high-technology industries in Canada (such as pharmaceutical products and electronic equipment), while
smaller in relative terms than their counterparts in the
US, actually have higher R&D intensity. Contrary to
conventional wisdom, there appear to be pockets of
strength in potential demand for university-developed
technologies.
In a much-cited article, Cohen and Levinthal (1990)
argued that firms’ ability to recognize the value of
external information and apply it to commercial production depends on their absorptive capacity. Human
capital is the base of absorptive capacity, and it is
unevenly distributed among firms (Zahra and George
2002). In Canada, human capital is concentrated in
pharmaceutical, computer and electrical equipment and
appliances, chemicals and petroleum and coal products

manufacturing (table 8). If the absorptive capacity literature is true, we should expect the demand for academic knowledge to be strongest in these industries.
Except in the largest economies such as those of
the United States, China and Japan, R&D is typically
concentrated in a small number of industries
(Archibugi and Pianta 1992). Canada’s R&D is no
exception to this rule. Canadian BERD is concentrated
in the information and communication technologies
industries (communication equipment manufacturing,
the information and cultural industries, computer
systems design and services, and the semiconductor
and other electronic components industries) as well
as the medical products industries (pharmaceuticals
and medicine and scientific R&D, particularly human
health and biotechnology) and the aerospace products
and parts industry (table 9). Industrial R&D is also
highly concentrated at the firm level: just 100 companies accounted for over 56 percent of the $14.9 billion spent on industrial R&D in 2006 (Statistics
Canada 2007). This highly skewed demand for technology is consistent with the fact noted earlier that

only three Canadian companies are among the
world’s largest technology firms.
Perhaps most important, universities are not the
only source of technology for companies. In fact, for
Canadian firms, other domestic and foreign companies are a much more important source of technology
than universities (table 10). The greatest users of
licensed technology were the pharmaceuticals, computers and electronic products, petroleum and coal
products, and transportation equipment (aerospace)
industries. While companies in some industries (such
as pharmaceuticals and primary metals manufacturing) do acquire technology from universities, they are
far more likely to acquire it from other firms.
Surprisingly, the aerospace industry — which relies
heavily on constant technology improvement — does
not draw on universities at all for technology licensing. Aerospace companies in Canada conduct surprisingly little R&D and own few patents compared with
their US and European competitors, thus reducing
demand for university technology (Zhegu 2007).
Finally, innovation is more frequent in larger
firms, and the tendency to collaborate with universities increases with the size of the firm (Hanel and
St-Pierre 2006). Most industry-university collaborations involve firms of over 500 employees.
The evidence on the robustness of university technology demand is thus mixed. Canada’s poor performance with regard to BERD has long been
documented and lamented, but there are pockets of
strength in high-tech industries such as pharmaceuticals and electronic products. At the same time, most
Canadian firms turn to other companies for licensed
technology — circumstantial evidence that they are
not finding the technologies they need in universities.

University-Industry Technology
Transfer
he fact that universities play such a marginal
role in technology licensing in Canada demands
a closer look at the mechanics of universityindustry technology transfer.
In most Canadian universities, academic
researchers must disclose all inventions they develop
or discover that may have commercial potential to
the university’s office of technology transfer (OTT) or
university-industry liaison office (UILO). The
OTT/UILO then evaluates it and decides whether the
invention should be protected through patents, copyright (in the case of software), industrial design or
other intellectual property legislation. If the OTT/UILO
decides protection is needed, the inventor and the
university then sign an agreement about the division
of the eventual royalties. The OTT/UILO then proceeds
to look for potential licensees. If it decides that the

T

11

invention is not worth protecting, full rights of commercialization are returned to the inventor, who then
has entire freedom to commercialize it.
A major difference between the US and Canada is
that in the US, university-produced innovations belong
exclusively to the university, while in Canada each university has its own rules. There is a trend in Canada
toward compulsory disclosure and eventual retrocession of the innovation to the inventor, who could
patent or offer the technology to a company. In less
than half of Canada’s universities, inventions must
always be reported (table 11).
The innovation, whether owned by the academic or by
the university, can be licensed to a private company, large
or small. In many cases, however, the innovation is produced by the academic under contract with a firm,with the
condition that the invention will belong to that firm, and
cannot be disclosed or become property of the university.
Under this system, the entire responsibility of locating a potential user of any given innovation falls upon
either the OTT/UILO or the researcher — essentially a

supply-push model. Yet, evidence suggests that neither is entirely equipped to assess the commercial
value of the technology or its potential market. In
Canada, the European Union and the US, a large percentage of the patents where academics are the inventors belong to private firms or to the researchers
themselves. In several cases, these discoveries were
returned to the inventors by the academic institutions.
Most OTTs/UILOs are staffed by just a handful of individuals, who simply cannot be expected to stay on top
of all potential markets for the inventions that come
across their desks. I will suggest later that increasing the
demand for university technology, particularly among
SMEs, through incentives to seek out universitydeveloped research — a demand-pull model — is a far
better way to promote academic technology commercialization. These incentives may substantially help
address bottlenecks, match suppliers with demanders
and move more university-developed technologies
across the valley of death.

IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008

Legislative changes: a Canadian Bayh-Dole Act?
In the United States, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980
represents a landmark in terms of legislative efforts
to stimulate the transfer of university-developed
technology to industry. It was motivated by the fact
that the US government held tens of thousands of
patents stemming from its funding of R&D in universities and government laboratories. However,
only a tiny proportion of these were commercially
licensed, reflecting the fact that governments are
not primarily in the business of technology commercialization.
To increase the incentive to commercialize publicly
funded R&D, the Act transfers ownership of an invention
or discovery from the government agency that helped to

pay for it to the academic institution that carried out the
actual research. Furthermore, it ensures that the
researchers themselves receive a portion of the economic
benefits resulting from it. Over the course of time, other
jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation; for example, Germany passed such legislation in 2001 and, in
Canada, Quebec passed a similar law in 2002.
Evidence on the effectiveness of the Bayh-Dole
Act is mixed. The Expert Panel on Commercialization
concluded that it was directly responsible for the
creation of thousands of new firms and added tens
of billions of dollars to the US economy (2006). But
an earlier study of Stanford, MIT and Columbia
found very little change in these universities’ patent
and licensing portfolios in the 10 years following the
passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, and concluded that
the Act had little, if any, effect on technology transfer (Mowery et al. 2001).
Irrespective of the magnitude of economic benefits
from the Bayh-Dole Act and similar legislation, there
is concern in some quarters that the incentives they
contain encourage undue commercial influence on
the direction of academic research. Many scientists,
economists and lawyers believe such incentives distort the fundamental mission of universities, diverting them from the pursuit of basic knowledge, which
is freely disseminated, to a focused search for results
that have practical and industrial purposes.
Finally, according to the AUTM surveys, American
and Canadian university academic publication rates
are similar, controlling for the size of the two countries and the research funds available to academics in
the two nations (AUTM 2007a,b). At the same time,
wide differences persist among universities in the two
countries’ ability to patent, license and create spinoff companies (table 12). It may be that the differ-

merged part of the iceberg of technologies that are
appealing to industry but are either produced under
contract by academics or not patented by universities.
Even at the famous Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, patenting and licensing represent less
than 10 percent of all technology transferred from its
laboratories (Agrawal and Henderson 2002).
According to Thursby, Fuller and Thursby (2007),
patents in the physical and engineering sciences were
more often assigned to firms, while those in the biological sciences were more likely to be assigned to universities. Another, similar, study found that 33 percent of
the university-invented patents were assigned to firms
(Markman, Gianodis and Phan 2006). In both cases,
Bayh-Dole and university regulations were bypassed.
This is due to the fact that most academic research that
results in patents is supported by contract research, not
by public funds, and the inventors assign the research
results to their sponsors, not to their universities.
Since most university research in Canada is not
patented and licensed by universities, the incentives in
Bayh-Dole-type legislation would not capture some key
channels of technology transfer from universities to
industry. The creators of Bayh-Dole could not have
foreseen all the possible channels of technology transfer, such as technologies that that universities do not
patent but that nevertheless attract business enterprises,
mostly large ones. Canadian surveys of innovation
show that large companies have many more links with
universities than do small companies. Yet, there are
more than a million small companies in Canada.
Increases in Canadian productivity is more likely to
come from smaller companies than from larger ones
(Terajima, Leung and Marsh 2006)
Despite the fact that there are many influential proponents of Canada adopting the equivalent of the BayhDole Act (including the 1999 report of the Advisory
Council on Canadian Science and Technology), it would
be unwise to do so. The economic benefits of such legislation would likely be very small, and it would have virtually no effect on the large amount of academic
research that is contracted directly by industry.

Moving toward a demand-pull model of
university-industry technology transfer
The fundamental challenge of crossing the valley of
death is that it is exceedingly difficult to coordinate the
myriad research activities in universities with the everchanging technology needs of industry (and, as noted
above, excessive coordination may not be desirable).
Thousands of academic papers are published annually in

Connecting the Dots between University Research and Industrial Innovation, by Jorge Niosi

ences in the experience and the quality of their
OTT/UILO personnel, organizational structures, and
financial resources, as well as differences in university cultures, explain some of the wide variations
among universities (Rothaermel, Agung and Jiang
2007). Lotka’s Law4 may also explain the wide variations: over 60 percent of academic publishing is
accounted for by less than 6 percent of academics. It
may be that the same law applies to university
patenting. Some universities have been able to attract
highly productive and entrepreneurial academics who
make a difference in the institutions.5
It may be that the rapid increase academic patenting and licensing in both countries since 1990 is due
not to the legislative environment, but to the rise of
biotechnology, a discipline that reinforces pharmaceutical research and is responsible for over 50 percent of
all patents, licences, income and spinoff companies in
the two countries (Mowery et al. 2001).
When analyzing the supply of university technology, one has to bear in mind that in Canada the
majority of the patents stemming from academic
research in the top universities are assigned not to
the university but to private firms (Gingras et al.
2004). The figures are similar in Europe (Crespi,
Geuna and Verspagen 2006; Geuna and Nesta 2006;
Saragossi and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie
2003). In sharp contrast, over 62 percent of the
patents invented by faculty members at the top US
research universities were assigned to the institutions, and only 26 percent solely to firms. These figures are important because they show that some
technology transfer goes unnoticed because attention is focused on technology owned by universities
and transferred to industries, ignoring the sub-

<-----Page 15----->IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008

hundreds of journals and conference proceedings, and
it is beyond the capacity of even the best-equipped
university OTT/UILO to identify which inventions are
most likely to have commercial potential.
A more promising option is to turn the equation
around: businesses are much better equipped to judge
the commercial potential of university research, but they
are unwilling to shoulder the financial risk of carrying it
out. This is particularly true of SMEs. The social benefits
of encouraging businesses to do so are potentially large
and would justify government support.
The United States has been innovative compared
with other countries in this regard. In 1982, the United
States passed the Small Business Innovation Research
Act (SBIR) in order to facilitate the absorption of new
technology by small and medium-sized enterprises, and
in 1992 it passed the Small Business Technology
Transfer Research Act (STTR). The SBIR provides up to
$850,000 in early-stage R&D to small technology companies or to entrepreneurs who launch a company. The
STTR program provides up to a similar sum to small
companies working in cooperation with academic
researchers at universities or government researchers in
public laboratories, in order to explore the commercial
feasibility of new ideas emerging from these institutions. The different federal departments that allocate
R&D funds to private firms, the most important of
which is the Department of Defense, run both programs. In fiscal year 2007, all departments combined,
SBIR was funded at US$1.14 billion and STTR at $131
million. In order to qualify for SBIR grants, firms must
have fewer than 500 employees and conduct R&D in
the United States. In addition, the principal investigator
has to work at least half time in the proposing firm. The
STTR grants have similar firm-size requirements, but
the principal investigator may be employed at either
the firm or the research institution. Also, the SME has
to be more than 50 percent owned by its managers
and/or employees. This prerequisite creates obstacles for
companies already financed by venture capital, but has
the advantage of concentrating funds in the early
stages of technology development. Thus, SBIR and
STTR appear as second- to third-stage funds (see figure
1). The programs have three phases (table 13). Small
businesses compete in phase I, and at this stage the
grant is allocated after peer review of the technology. If
phase I achieves promising results, then a second grant
is awarded to the firm. Phase III is the commercialization stage, where no SBIR funds are committed. Phase
II finishers are supposed to obtain either private or
other public funds to continue the R&D process. Also,

in fiscal year 2006, over 90 percent of the awardees
were firms with fewer than 100 employees (see figure
2). This means that the program, which is aimed at
small firms, is reaching its intended target.
SBIR and STTR programs have helped thousands of
innovative firms to explore the technical merit of new
ideas or technologies, which typically emerge from academic or public laboratory research, by reducing the
cost of exploration and conversion of scientific ideas
into commercial products (Auerswald and Branscomb
2003; Wessner 1999). An evaluation of SBIR conducted
in 2006, while criticizing some of its management routines (and suggesting ways the program could be
improved), concluded that it was attaining most of its
specific missions (RAND Corporation 2006).
Another American initiative is the Advanced
Technology Program (ATP). In 1990, the US Congress
created ATP in the US National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), part of the Department of
Commerce, in order to help US businesses commercialize generic technologies and refine manufacturing
methods.6 Companies, or consortia of companies, propose research projects to NIST, and the agency selects
the proposals considered to have the largest economic
potential. Government and industry share the costs of
early-stage technology development. Universities can
participate in consortia and propose projects but, significantly, they cannot serve as project leaders.
ATP is more of a demand-pull program with regard
to early-stage technologies: the research priorities in
funded projects are set by industry, not by the government, academia or public laboratories. Partner companies must pay at least 50 percent of the project costs.
ATP funding eligibility is not confined to SMEs; large
corporations may also participate, but they must cover

US venture capital does, and it encourages the proliferation of very small enterprises. Consider the situation of
biotechnology, the industry that receives the majority of
technologies transferred from universities. In 2005,
Canada had over 500 dedicated biotechnology firms
(DBFs). This compared with 1,500 in the United States,
which has an economy over 10 times larger than
Canada’s. Canadian DBFs often live or die with one technology. Introduced in Canada, programs like the American
ones described here mght serve to consolidate smaller
firms into larger and more viable entities.

Connecting the Dots between University Research and Industrial Innovation, by Jorge Niosi

at least 60 percent of the costs of the project. The program does not cover product development. Also, like
SBIR and STTR, it is not a substitute for tax credits
for R&D or venture capital; but smaller companies
often do not have any taxable income to benefit from
tax credits. Thus, ATP helps emerging companies to
explore new technologies in partnership with academic or government researchers. Out of 768 ATP awards
granted between 1990 and September 2004, 508 (66
percent) went to small businesses, either as single
applicants or leading joint ventures. In this period,
ATP committed US$2.2 billion, and private companies
committed a similar amount, for an average award of
$3 million and 55 awards per year.7
In its 2001 report, the US National Research
Council concluded that ATP is a successful program
for bringing early-stage technologies to commercial
fruition. The council suggested several operational
improvements, such as reducing the delays between
applications and awards, concentrating on selected
areas of science and technology and stabilizing R&D
funding (Wessner and STEP 2001).
Programs such as these are an interesting solution to
the technology transfer conundrum: a bridge over the
valley of death. They can also provide some support to
help small firms grow. While it is true that Canada has
one of the highest ratios of venture capital to GDP
(Baygan 2003), that venture capital is concentrated in
the early stages of funding (seed capital). Thus it is
spread more thinly and supports more companies than

ohnen and Röller (2005) have shown that
innovation policies often complement each
other: some reinforce the supply of human
capital and the production of technology, while others
nurture the adoption of technology and the demand for
human capital. From the foregoing analysis, it is clear
that Canada has much room for improvement in terms
of stimulating the demand for university technology.
The Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP),
under the auspices of the National Research Council, is
the main vehicle for supporting SME business innovation. IRAP provides four main services: advice, financial
support for R&D activities, networking and partnerships.
Its total annual budget is about $150 million, of which
just under 50 percent is earmarked for R&D activities.
IRAP is generally well regarded, and displays some
characteristics of demand-pull technology transfer. It has
been evaluated several times and has always obtained
high marks (Lipsey and Carlaw 1998). In a study that
compared the effectiveness of IRAP and venture capital
in stimulating university spinoffs, Niosi (2006) found
that IRAP funding was more often linked to rapid
growth than is private venture capital. Its funding should
be increased.
The SME Partnerships Initiative, proposed by the
Expert Panel on Commercialization, would be a commercialization superfund to address SMEs’ commercialization
challenges, to expand federal programs that support seed
and start-up firms in proving their business ideas, and to
increase research funds to SMEs to augment and improve
technology transfer to smaller firms. It would differ from
the STTR/SBIR programs in one critical respect. Under
the American programs, the firms themselves undertake
initiatives and applications, and decide which technologies deserve further exploration. Under the proposed SME

<-----Page 17----->Partnerships Initiative, government laboratories and
universities would determine the commercial application of their technologies and compete for the funds
disbursed by the Canadian SME Partnerships Initiative.
Once funds are allocated to universities and government labs, they would then choose their business sector
partners, to whom they would transfer funds for feasibility studies and prototype development.
But channelling technology transfer funds through
universities or public research labs is not the best
way to commercialize research results. Firms are better equipped to judge the commercial potential of
technologies developed in the universities, and they
should play a central role in identifying those that
are worthy of support. The SME Partnerships
Initiative proposal clearly would not permit this.
On the supply side, even if Canadian performance is
widely considered satisfactory, there is room for
improvement. It has repeatedly been suggested that the
development of TTOs/UILOs in universities would help
the commercialization of academic research, and that
governments should subsidize their growth.8 Although
they have existed across Canada since the late 1980s,
compared with those in the US, they are understaffed
and underfunded. Additional funding would help them
to better tackle the complex technical, legal, administrative and economic dimensions of technology transfer.

Conclusions
or a more balanced national system of innovation, policy-makers in Canada should focus on
demand-pull policies that encourage businesses
to participate more directly in research funding decisions that impinge on university research directions,
without going so far as to dictate their specifics. This
would be the most effective way to support the commercialization process. University professors are primarily motivated by the attraction of publishing, but
knowing that businesses are interested in what goes
on in their labs may influence the broad research
directions they take, without compromising the
integrity and independence of individual projects.
Demand-pull policies are much better developed in
the United States than they are in Canada. Although
they would be costly to fund and complex to implement in Canada, programs like ATP, SBIR and STTR
could increase demand among SMEs for academic and
government laboratory technology. These programs

IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008

F

have helped thousands of innovative SMEs to explore
the technical merit of a new idea or technology, typically one emerging from academia or a public laboratory (Auerswald and Branscomb, 2003; Wessner, 1999).
Some demand-side policies would thus help increase
the absorptive capacity of high-technology industries,
which in Canada mostly consist of small firms.
Canada does not need Bayh-Dole-type legislation. It
is far from certain that the Bayh-Dole Act has
improved the performance of university-industry linkages in the United States. If the US academic system
performs on average better than those of other countries, this may be due to a combination of internal and
external factors, including high levels of public funding for academic research, a system based on global
recruitment of professors and students, a very active
venture capital industry supporting university startups, large internal national and regional markets, and
policies stimulating the exploration of public technologies by SMEs. Also, legislating patents, spinoffs and
licences would only affect a few of the numerous
channels of university-industry technology transfer,
without even eliminating the assignment of intellectual
property generated by academics to their industrial
partners through contractual research and IP protection of all the inventions disclosed by academics.
Canada should, however, establish a program similar to ATP, SBIR or STTR, which would fund the
exploration by SMEs of technology produced in public laboratories, and in universities under public funds.
Given its excellent track record, a pilot program within IRAP would be a welcome addition to the incentives for firms to use university and public sector
innovation, as well as a complement to the different
tools IRAP uses to promote technological innovation
in Canadian industry. Later on, after due evaluation,
the program could eventually be extended to other
public departments that subsidize industrial research,
as the American government did with SBIR and STTR.
Canada has more SMEs than most other OECD
nations. Its sluggish productivity record in the last 20
years is almost certainly related to the slow adoption
by SMEs of advanced technology. A coordinated program to increase the demand for innovative technology among these firms and linking them to frontier
academic research will certainly have an impact on
their productivity, allowing them to become the global technology powerhouses of tomorrow.

An angel investor is a person who invests in a business
venture, providing capital for start-up or expansion.
These individuals are looking for a higher rate of return
than would be given by more traditional investments
(typically 25 percent or more). Angel investors are perceived as filling the gap between the financing provided
by family and friends and venture capitalists.
Though comparable data for emerging Asian economies
are not available, countries such as South Korea, China
and Taiwan award a higher percentage of degrees in
NS&E than the mature industrial democracies.
These data are not drawn from random samples, and
thus do not necessarily reflect national trends.
According to this law, a small number of authors are
responsible for a high percentage of academic publications.
The cases of Michael Smith, winner of the Nobel Prize
in chemistry 1993 at the University of British
Columbia, as well as Jean-Pierre Adoul in telecommunications engineering at the University of Sherbrooke,
are examples of the major role played by scholars in
technology creation and transfer in two of the most
entrepreneurial Canadian universities.
The ATP was formally abolished as part of the America
COMPETES Act, signed in August 2007. It is to be succeeded by a new Technology Innovation Program,
whose general mission will be similar to that of the ATP.

y almost every measure, Canada is one of the
best countries in the world in which to live.
Excellent health care, high-quality public education, well-functioning infrastructure systems, consistent economic growth and stable governance — no
wonder so many other nations look with admiration at
the quality of life we share in Canada. Nor is it a secret
how we achieved our current status. Canada has
advanced so far in a relatively short history because of
careful, considered planning balanced against the pragmatic courage that characterizes societies like ours,
built on the survival strategies of First Nations and the
pioneering imagination and energy of immigrants.
As Jorge Niosi clearly outlines in “Connecting the
Dots between University Research and Industrial
Innovation,” Canada in 2008 has enormous knowledge resources, the capacity to produce innovative
ideas and the desire to move forward. Yet, in spite of
our current strengths, we are progressively falling
behind our global economic competitors. In the most
recent World Economic Forum Global Competitive
Index, we slipped to thirteenth place in 2007-08,
down one spot from the previous year (World
Economic Forum 2007). In terms of our capacity for
innovation, we now rank seventeenth in the world,
behind the US and many East Asian and northern
European nations.
Why are we slipping? We all aspire to a future in
which Canada is a world leader in research, business,
industry and the arts. We have spent a great deal of
time pondering important questions: What is innovation? How can we promote it in Canada and increase
our productivity? How can we position our innovations to compete in a changing global marketplace? In
2002, we created the Innovation Strategy; in 2006, the
Expert Panel on Commercialization, of which I was a
member, produced recommendations for improving
commercialization (Expert Panel on Commercialization

major US research universities, creating frontline access
to university expertise and innovations.1
As Niosi tells us, studies over the last two decades
have shown that university research has a significant
positive impact upon industrial innovation, and so the
move to more highly integrated partnerships between
universities and industry seems a promising strategy
for promoting innovation (5). In spite of this promise,
Canada, unlike the US, has been slow to move in this
direction. The reasons for this are, as Niosi suggests,
complex, and they arise from a combination of factors,
such as our strong reliance upon “resource-intensive
industries whose firms have low or medium R&D intensity,” and the existence of lower R&D intensity compared to our main G8 competitors “in selected large
industries (particularly automobile manufacturing and
the service sector)” (9). The fact that Canadians own
very few large technology-intensive companies adds to
the problem.
As Niosi suggests, given the scarcity of large
Canadian firms, a focus on building university partnerships with major industrial firms, while important, can
only take us so far. We must also pay particular attention to the potential for research partnerships with
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have
fewer than 500 employees and are far more prevalent
in Canada than large firms. This idea is not particularly
new, but it has failed to gain widespread traction in the
Canadian economic imagination and so still needs the
analysis and explication that Niosi brings to bear in his
study. Like many an innovative idea in this country, the
idea that SMEs have a huge role to play in the commercialization of ideas and inventions seems to be in
its own sort of “valley of death,” unable to bridge the
gap between idea and action.
This failure to bridge the gap certainly is not indicative of an inability to recognize the problem. In fact, in
the past two decades, a number of government initiatives designed to foster commercialization through partnerships between university research and SMEs have
been put into place in Canada. We have the National
Networks of Excellence, the National Research Council’s
Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP), 4th pillar
organizations, and the more recently established Centres
of Excellence in Research and Commercialization. Small
pockets of funding for early-stage commercialization
have long been available through the tri-council funding
agencies. In addition, provincial governments have
acted; in Alberta, for example, Alberta Ingenuity has just
launched the new Ingenuity Centres for Research and
Commercialization program.

Innovation: Enough Talk, Time to Act, by Indira V. Samarasekera

2006); in October 2007, a new panel was struck to perform a competition policy review, now underway; and
most recently, the Canadian government drafted its
new Science Technology Strategy, laying out plans to
stimulate technical innovations and train people to
develop and use them.
It is clear that there is general acceptance that
innovation, enterprise, productivity and competitiveness characterize an economic world leader. We have
discussed, reviewed and proposed many strategies for
moving forward, but now it is time to stop planning,
be pragmatic and courageous, and act! If we look to
our strengths and to the unique characteristics of
Canada’s economic and research landscapes, we can
use what we know, choose a strategy and put it to
work. The key now is to move quickly.
Speed is becoming increasingly necessary. Global
trends in research and development are emerging at a
pace unknown in the past. Technical and scientific
innovations are not innovations for long and an
opportunity delayed is often an opportunity missed.
In response, many corporations and industries are
reducing their in-house R&D capacity and turning
away from risky basic and applied scientific research
toward fast-moving technology development.
Society’s need for basic research has not disappeared; indeed, it is the root cause of major discoveries
that seed the technological innovations that change
lives. As private sector R&D changes, it is increasingly
critical that governments continue to support curiosity-driven research conducted at universities, which are
able to provide the sophisticated infrastructure and
expertise to conduct groundbreaking research while
also assuming the high risks of such work.
At the same time, however, it is also vital that we
develop efficient methods for translating the new
knowledge generated at universities into usable products, processes and services. As major corporations and
industry move away from in-house R&D, they need
universities to help them develop ideas, innovations
and inventions they can take to the marketplace. As a
result, in countries around the world, new kinds of
university-industry partnerships are quickly emerging.
Corporations are setting up laboratories close to
major research universities in order to facilitate the
speedy transfer of knowledge. Intel, for example, now
has laboratories adjacent to the Universities of
California, Washington and Cambridge, as well as
Carnegie Mellon University. GlaxoSmithKline, BP,
Exxon Mobil and Chevron have invested millions in
integrated university-industry partnerships with

<-----Page 23----->IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008

All of these programs have led, or promise to lead,
to significant successes, but so far have failed to stimulate the widespread growth in innovation or the
increases in productivity that Canada needs to effectively compete in the emerging global marketplace.
When I served as a member of the six-person Expert
Panel on Commercialization in 2005-06, we evaluated
the programs that were then in existence, such as
IRAP, 4th pillar organizations and programs in the tricouncil agencies. Each has strengths and weaknesses;
each provides valuable insight into how we might
move forward. Yet none, in itself, is the solution.
Part of the problem is that almost all our existing
commercialization programs focus on the supply side
of the commercialization process, putting the onus on
universities and researchers to create or search for
demand. But, as Niosi argues, “Firms are better
equipped to judge the commercial potential of technologies developed in universities, and they should
play a central role in identifying those that are worthy
of support” (16). If we agree with this assessment —
and the Expert Panel on Commercialization certainly
did — the question that must be answered is this: How
do we induce Canada’s numerous SMEs to play this
role — to partner with universities in identifying the
commercial potential of technical discoveries? It won’t
be easy, because, as Niosi also notes, for most
“Canadian firms, other domestic and foreign companies are a much more important source of technology
than universities” (10).
To ascertain how we might make it happen, Niosi
points us to the model offered by the US Small
Business Administration’s Small Business Innovation
Research program (SBIR), a model that I too believe is
worth a closer look. If we agree that a new commercialization model is needed — and all the evidence
suggests that we do — then we should consider the
successes that the SBIR has had in creating the access
to top-quality university-level research that entrepreneurs need to advance their business goals.
The SBIR illustrates how a national program can
create opportunities for SMEs to engage in and take
advantage of high-level basic and applied research.
This program, introduced in 1982, has now weathered
more than a quarter century of scrutiny and assessment, including a comprehensive review requested by
the US Congress and conducted by the US National
Research Council. According their recently released
findings, the SBIR plays a significant role in both
stimulating innovation and promoting the growth of
SMEs,2 as well as effectively linking both public and

private markets to high-level research3 and enabling
the dissemination of knowledge through a variety of
means, ranging from patents and licences to spinoff
companies and human capital (Wessner 2008).4
The SBIR has the focus on the demand side of the
commercialization process and the national mandate
and breadth that Canadian programs have so far
lacked. The US federal government’s Small Business
Administration (SBA) administers the overall SBIR
program by distributing funds through 11 US government funding agencies.5 Each agency solicits funding
proposals from SMEs in response to very specific topics determined by agency needs. Thus, the proposals
and research are directed to national priorities, and
the economic feasibility of proposals and research is
determined by the SMEs, which have the best knowledge of market needs.
Only SMEs located in the US are eligible to
respond to solicitations. Proposing companies are
strongly encouraged, though not required, to contract
a university-based researcher to evaluate or conduct
the basic research. Proposals are peer reviewed, to
ensure relevance and quality, by program managers
and their research teams working in the national laboratories of each agency.6
As Niosi outlines, winners of an SBIR award follow a three-phase process: phase I is proof of concept
(six months, up to $100,000, deliverable is a more
extensive research plan); phase II is development of
prototype (two years, up to $750,000, deliverable is
prototype); and phase III is unfunded government
assistance in capitalizing the advancement of the
project. Many SBIR winners do not compete for phase
II or phase III as their innovations, based on a strong
research plan or proof-of-concept document, are
picked up by investors, venture capitalists, or large
corporate licensees who are interested in seeing the
concept developed and taken to market faster than
the SBIR process allows.
SBIR succeeds in achieving three major commercialization objectives that we, in Canada, want to
attain. First, it effectively links SMEs to the research
community, with the SMEs, rather than universities,
identifying technical and scientific innovations that
have the greatest potential to respond to market
demands. In this, the SBIR model shares important
characteristics with the “open innovation” model
emerging in large corporations across the world.7
Second, SBIR provides entrepreneurs and SMEs with
a way to bridge the “valley of death,” which often
prevents a concept from progressing from the
22

<-----Page 24----->23

model we devise, it must have leadership from industry
and business, and demand from them active participation in setting commercialization priorities and in evaluating specific projects’ commercial viability.
Tom Brzustowski, in his book The Way Ahead:
Meeting Canada’s Productivity Challenge, suggests that
all existing and new provincial and federal research and
commercialization programs be operated within one
umbrella system. This would require harmonization of
general administrative policies, criteria and processes
across provincial and federal barriers and among various
funding programs, but it would still allow for the regional or disciplinary differences between them. Brzustowski
admits that implementation of his proposal would be
difficult, but it would not be impossible if leadership in
government, universities and industry were committed
to making it happen (Brzustowski 2008).
There is no doubt that the development of a
Canadian solution will require strong and decisive
action from industry and business, government and
universities working together. It will require us to identify the areas and markets in which Canada has the
greatest potential to be a global leader, and put into
place government policies and programs that strategically promote investment and innovation in these areas
of national interest and stimulate the innovation
capacity and growth of Canada’s numerous SMEs.
If we can succeed, we will inject new energy for seeking discoveries and breakthroughs throughout all sectors
of the Canadian economy, and we will connect the SME
community to a larger vision driving innovation. We can
break out of the endless planning cycle we seem to be
caught in and reawaken the pragmatic courage that built
this nation. We can create both a system for success and
a mindset of success — a mindset that prompts us to be
highly connected and highly competitive. That strategy
must be unique to Canada – putting the pressure on us,
first and foremost, to be innovative in designing a strategy that connects and serves all the players in the innovation game: government, industry, universities,
researchers and entrepreneurs.

prototype stage to product development. Third, when
successful, the process leads to the development of
new companies or the growth of established ones, the
latter being of major concern in Canada.
To attain our objectives, there are important elements of the SBIR model that could be emulated. The
recipients of an SBIR award can each play to their
strengths. While the commercial aspects of the venture are handled by entrepreneurs with the right
expertise, researchers are able to focus on their
strengths and conduct research without distraction.
The SBIR process provides the credibility of rigorous
peer review — which validates the quality of the
research plan while also controlling the entrepreneur’s
risk in pursuing an innovative idea. Intellectual property rights are held by the SME with a royalty-free
licence to the federal government in return for providing the initial funds. Last, but far from least, the SBIR
puts the research and commercialization process on a
clear and accountable timeline.
Is it possible for Canada to do the same? Can we
put the commercialization process on a predictable,
speedy timeline? Can we develop a standard national
policy on intellectual property rights that will allow
SMEs — or the larger organizations they may sell
their innovations to — clear and defensible ownership
of rights for ongoing development and international
marketing purposes? Can we develop a commercialization model that will make the best use of peer
reviewers from industry, university and government to
evaluate proposals and select those that are most
responsive to market demands and have the highest
scientific merit and highest potential for success?
Although very successful in the US, the SBIR’s
model cannot simply be cloned directly in Canada. We
do not share the same kind of broad and diverse federal R&D structure through which funds can be distributed, and thus a model would need to be developed to
suit Canada’s unique situation. The Expert Panel on
Commercialization recommended that a business-led
Commercialization Partnership Board be created to
play both an advisory role to the Minister of Industry
on identifying and setting national commercialization
goals, and an oversight role on the development and
implementation of commercialization policies, initiatives, investments and programs. Likewise, the
Conference Board of Canada’s Leaders’ Roundtable on
Commercialization proposed the creation of industryled collaborative research networks.
The emphasis in both of these proposals on industry leadership indicates that whatever administrative

In a prepublication executive summary (available at
http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11989.html), Charles W.
Wessner, editor of An Assessment of the Small
Business Innovation Research Program, writes that
“just over 20 percent of companies responding to the
NRC Phase II Survey indicated that they were founded
entirely because of a prospective SBIR award” and the
“companies responding to the same survey reported
that over two-thirds of SBIR projects would not have
taken place without SBIR funding” (Wessner 2008, 3).
Wessner also notes that one-third of SBIR respondents
to the NRC survey involved universities in the following ways: “1. More than two-thirds of companies
reported that at least one founder was previously an
academic; 2. About one-third of founders were most
recently employed as academics before founding the
company; and 3. Some 27 percent of projects had university faculty as contractors on the project, 17 percent
used universities themselves as subcontractors, and 15
percent employed graduate students” (Wessner 2008, 3).
Wessner’s complete list of “knowledge outputs”
includes “data, scientific and engineering publications,
patents and licenses of patents, presentations, analytical models, algorithms, new research equipment, reference samples, prototype products and processes,
spin-off companies, and new ‘human capital’
(enhanced know-how, expertise, and sharing of knowledge)” (Wessner 2008, 2).
The 11 federal agencies include the following departments: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education,
Energy, Health and Human Services (including the
National Institutes of Health), Homeland Security,
Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency,
NASA and the National Science Foundation. Ninetysix percent of SBIR program expenditures are made by
five departments: Defense, the National Institutes of
Health, NASA, Energy and the National Science
Foundation.
The National Institutes of Health, which assemble a
national panel of external reviewers, are the exception
to this.
For example, Procter & Gamble began developing its
“connect and develop” innovation model in 2000 when
it realized that its in-house R&D could not drive the
kind of growth expected from a $70-billion company.
Noting that the products that it had acquired from
external sources performed well, CEO A.G. Lafley
reformed P&G’s research strategy, acquiring 50 percent
of its innovations from outside the company. Through
“connect and develop,” P&G personnel “identify promising ideas throughout the world and apply [their] own
R&D, manufacturing, marketing, and purchasing capabilities to them to create better and cheaper products,
faster” (Huston and Sakkab 2006).

How Can Canada Compete
and Win?
Ilse Treurnicht
am grateful for the opportunity to comment briefly
on both the thoughtful study by Jorge Niosi and
the response from Indira Samarasekera, President
of the University of Alberta. As Samarasekera notes,
the commercialization of university research has drawn
increasing attention in Canada, but our performance is
still lagging.
My own perspectives have been shaped by two
decades of work in and around technology-based startup companies. Although I see no quick fixes for our
current malaise, I am optimistic about Canada’s ability
to build and grow more successful innovation-based
businesses.
Let us first ask, does Niosi have the diagnosis right?
Is the problem primarily with research uptake rather
than research output?
The answer, I believe, is a qualified “Yes.”
First, an important caveat: no one knows how many
researchers and graduate students are required to create
a thriving innovation economy. It is, of course, simplistic to say that more research output will solve the
uptake problem, but it is also not clear that we have
optimized the quality and quantity of outputs, as
regards either the research undertaken or the graduate
students being trained.
True, the higher education R&D (HERD) data reflect
positively on Canada’s investment in research. But the
reality is different than the figures on gross spending.
Our universities are seriously underfunded compared to
US peer institutions, even as research investment is
growing rapidly in countries like China. In fact, the
Canadian research pipeline is heavily underwritten by
universities themselves, using their operating funds and
philanthropic support — a factor overlooked in most
intercountry comparisons.
In the context of global competition, the gap in perstudent funding between Canada’s leading research
universities and US universities is big and widening. A

<-----Page 27----->simple example: the average per-student funding of
private research-intensive universities in the US is 10
times the per-student funding of the University of
Toronto; even for US public research-intensive universities, the average is more than twice as high.
In this context, there are no grounds for complacency about continued investments in funding excellent research and graduate training, as well as
attracting outstanding talent to our universities and
retaining it.
That caveat aside, as Niosi argues, our commercialization performance does lag behind our research
publication rates. And I therefore support his argument that we rely unduly on a “supply-push” model
of commercialization at our peril. This could be
described as the “field of dreams” approach: “Patent
it and they will come”!
Our neighbour to the south, in contrast, has enjoyed
success with programs that create “demand pull,” such
as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and the Advanced Technology Program. Both
programs provide support directly to industry with a
view to drawing technology out of the university sector. I agree with Niosi and Samarasekera that programs
of this nature are valuable. That said, neither program
can be transplanted holus-bolus to Canada.
Transplantation works only if there is a match between
the donor and recipient — and our commercialization
ecosystem is different from that the the US.

The US Pipelines Are Different
e shall now point out some of the similarities and differences between the US and
Canadian innovation ecosystems.
Niosi suggests that, compared to the US, Canada is
well positioned in the physical and related natural
sciences because a higher overall proportion of university research in Canada is industry sponsored. I
worry that the statistics may not be commensurate.
Grants in the US from agencies such as the National
Institutes of Health and the National Science
Foundation partly cover personnel costs and fully
cover the institutional costs of research. The denominator of total research funding is therefore higher in
the US. The valid comparison is per capita rates of
industry-sponsored research funding, with adjustment for differences in overheads, broken out by disciplines. I have never seen that comparison published.

IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008

The comparison is further confounded by significant agency and military-sponsored strategic research
in the US. Agencies such as the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other branches of the US military establishment fund applied and,
in some cases, basic research that advances technologies in a focused manner through the proof-ofconcept stage and both directly and indirectly feeds
into larger and smaller enterprises, including those
supported by programs such as the SBIR.
The US government (through a diverse array of
agencies) also supports a strong network of national
laboratories. Entities such as Pacific Northwest
National Laboratories, Oak Ridge, Ames and Sandia
carry out targeted research, a significant proportion
of which is positioned for conversion into industrial
applications in fields such as energy, environment
and advanced manufacturing. In Canada, the federal
government and some provincial governments have
tried, through a variety of programs, to grow similar
strategic capacity. However, there is a recurrent tendency to confuse regional development with research
commercialization. The location of US national laboratories has also been subject to political and regional
forces, but, as a result of funding models that require
them to compete for research grants and industrial
contracts, their operational framework is more disciplined than most analogous enterprises in Canada
today. As a result, a US laboratory such as Oak Ridge
competes with the best universities in the world in
material science, as measured by research output in
leading scientific journals.

The US Receptors Are Different
here are also marked differences between
Canada and the US in the commercial environments that draw discoveries and technologies
out of universities. Many university-based discoveries
are well upstream from the market. They can only be
developed by sophisticated research-intensive industrial partners or through the creation of new companies supported by substantial risk capital.
R&D spending in Canadian industry remains well
below US numbers. And Canadian industry is still
dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises
with limited research capacity; larger firms are often
either resource companies (and thus cushioned from
innovation pressures by global market demand) or

T

Furthermore, our hub cities, the most likely regions
where university technologies might find early
adopters, are very geographically dispersed. This makes
it more challenging to transfer technologies to companies in close proximity to the university. It also means
that new companies based on those technologies need
to find their early adopter customers farther afield.
Without sufficient capital, patient investors and strong
management with international experience, these companies face significant hurdles.

Made-in-Canada Solutions
n the absence of a strong funding infrastructure for
strategic and applied research or a mature ecosystem for company creation, Canada’s innovation
economy lets some competitor jurisdictions get a head
start. Moreover, at risk of belabouring the obvious, we
cannot just cruise along on our natural resources.
Canada has to build a competitive innovation-based
economy and, as Samarasekera urges, the time to do so
is now. What, then, can we do?
First, we cannot be the US in miniature — even if we
wanted to be. Our population is small, and our industrial base and political culture are both different. That
means Canada should study a wide range of jurisdictions for practices and policies we can borrow.
Second, we need to take a hard look at some of our
current investments in the applied research and commercialization sphere. This includes programs that fund
industry collaboration through Canadian granting
councils, federal applied research laboratories and centres of excellence, as well as the programs supported by
the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC). We
should measure them against best practices and policies
in other jurisdictions and be willing to redirect those
funds or add to them dramatically, depending on the
results. A small population, with a vast geography and
a strong culture of regionalism, cries out for new models of collaboration to create focal points with a critical
mass of ideas, talent and capital that can compete on a
global scale.
Third, when in doubt, as Niosi and Samarasekera
argue, we should invest on the demand-pull side. NRC’s
Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) is situated in this space. The same might be said of 4th pillar
initiatives, such as Precarn, which straddle academe,
government and industry. These models are appealing
because they hinge on collaboration between industry

branch plants of international firms with R&D centres
elsewhere. The result is a lack of head office decisionmaking in Canada on research investment, and particularly on development of research innovation.
Creating and growing new Canadian companies
that can convert our important discoveries into global products is much more challenging than in the US
for other reasons as well. Entrepreneurial researchers
in Canada face a paucity of proof-of-concept funding
as well as early-stage equity capital from either
angels or institutional sources compared to the US.
The early-stage investment climate in Canada is less
mature than in the US — institutional seed funds only
emerged in the late 1990s and were all but wiped out
by the collapse of the technology bubble after 2001.
The Canadian angel investment community is less
active in the technology sector than US investors.
Canadian venture funds are typically smaller than
their US counterparts; as a result, they tend to invest
less per company and often struggle to support their
investee companies through the entire growth cycle.
There is also a marked difference between the investment approach and risk appetite of early-stage fund
managers in Canada versus the US: successful US
funds tend to be populated by industry experts and
former entrepreneurs, while many Canadian fund
managers migrated into venture capital from the
financial sector. By nature, they prefer to invest in
later-stage, revenue-generating prospects. It is true
that, even in the US, venture capital is concentrated
in hot spots like Silicon Valley or Boston.
Nonetheless, there are many sources of seed-stage
and follow-on funding for US start-up executives to
access, and they know where to find them.
A related constraint is that the Canadian market is
small compared to that of the US. Not only are our technology entrepreneurs fewer in number, but they must
also be globally oriented more or less from the outset.
In some important knowledge sectors, like health, the
already small Canadian market for adopting Canadian
innovation is further balkanized into provinces, and
spending on research/innovation is often viewed as a
cost in our system, not an investment.
This leads to a virtuous cycle in the US and a
vicious cycle in Canada. Fewer of our companies
mature to the scale where both investors and entrepreneurs reap major financial rewards. In the US, a
virtuous cycle fuels the reinvestment of capital and
the development of a pool of seasoned executives —
serial technology entrepreneurs who know how to
grow companies big.

<-----Page 29----->IRPP Choices, Vol. 14, no. 14, October 2008

and academe, with identified customers or market
applications. When all is said and done, academic
institutions and granting councils have commercialization only as a secondary objective and they are
short on the business skills and market contacts critical to a demand-pull strategy.
Fourth, governments should take further creative
steps to transform technology transfer in our universities and research hospitals. The federal government has
done so recently, with its backing of a program to
establish Centres of Excellence for Commercialization
and Research (CECR). Although the first wave of
investments was research-oriented, a number of centres funded subsequently will focus more on commercialization than on research itself. This is a welcome
development. It is imperative that these centres explore
new approaches and be evaluated rigorously to disseminate new learning. Similarly, I hope that the new
business-led centres of excellence programs will catalyze further engagement by industry in setting priorities and direction for collaborative research in areas of
strategic importance to the Canadian economy.
At risk of local boosterism, I note that one such
centre is MaRS Innovation — a member-based consortium of 14 university and hospital research institutions in downtown Toronto. Together, these
institutions represent over $1 billion of externally
funded research. MaRS Innovation will act as a common, integrated commercialization vehicle for all 14
institutions — with the ability to bundle inventions
into more marketable packages, to launch companies
based on robust IP platforms and to develop market
expertise in areas of shared research strength.
Perhaps most importantly, MaRS Innovation will create a single business-friendly point for interfacing
with industry, investors and entrepreneurs — bringing
together the best of Toronto’s discoveries from multiple institutions, but based outside of academe. This is
an important model to explore and develop further.
Fifth, beyond technology transfer, space and place
matter. Canada has a growing number of science
parks and incubation spaces, as well as multi-tenant
facilities that draw together academic researchers,
start-up companies and private-sector entities active
in commercialization (for example, service provider
firms, angels and venture funds). MaRS itself is an
example of this latter model. MaRS focuses on the
demand-pull side of the equation, doing market
research for young companies, providing incubation
and business advisory services, linking to the relevant
industry leaders, and connecting emerging companies

to the local and international angel and venture capital communities.
Sixth, and this is a critical item, we need bigger
pools of smart venture capital, focused on innovation-based companies. As has occurred in other small
jurisdictions, such as Israel, governments will need to
contribute to start the cycle of investment. The
recently announced Ontario Venture Capital Fund —
for which $90 million of the approximately $200 million comes from the government itself — exemplifies
this trend, and will hopefully catalyze the formation
of new funds in the market. Venture philanthropy
models, which bring a disciplined investment
approach to the deployment of donations in translational research or market validation projects, are also
worth exploring.
The final step is the most difficult and perhaps the
most crucial. We need a shift in national Zeitgeist. In
recent years, I have been struck by the fact that more
and more Canadians are expressing unease about our
prospects for long-term prosperity as a nation. I hear
concerns about our lack of an entrepreneurial culture
and the difficulty of creating a coherent national
strategy for commercialization when economic oversight is fractionated among three levels of government. I also hear and endorse more optimistic views
based on our extraordinary history of adaptability as
one of the world’s most successful experiments in
democratic pluralism. But, adaptable or not,
Canadians are losing ground. We urgently need bold
vision and bolder decisions if Canada is to compete
and win in the rapidly changing global economy.

Research and Industrial Innovation
by Jorge Niosi
With commentaries by
Indira V. Samarasekera and Ilse Treurnich
e Canada investissant beaucoup dans la recherche
universitaire sans en récolter les fruits en matière
d’innovation industrielle et de productivité, Jorge
Niosi examine dans cette étude les modes de transfert vers
le secteur industriel des technologies issues des universités.
Pour structurer son analyse, il établit un modèle d’offre
et de demande d’innovations qui prévoit que les avancées
scientifiques produisent à terme des technologies commercialement rentables. C’est du côté de l’offre, dominée par la
recherche universitaire, que les idées se transforment en
concepts, en études et en découvertes utiles. Et comme les
avantages économiques de cette recherche sont à la fois
dispersés et difficiles à prévoir, les gouvernements tendent à
y investir de fortes sommes. De fait, estime l’auteur, l’offre
universitaire en technologies innovantes se porte plutôt
bien au Canada selon des indicateurs comme l’investissement dans la R-D universitaire, le nombre de diplômés en
sciences et en génie, et les taux de publications savantes.
Du côté de la demande, soit à l’autre extrémité du
pipeline de la recherche universitaire, les entreprises misent sur des technologies clés pour concevoir des produits
et des processus rentables, qui exigent souvent un surcroît d’investissement en R-D. Mais plusieurs facteurs,
dont l’étroitesse relative et l’étendue géographique du
marché canadien, jouent en défaveur d’une forte
demande comparativement aux États-Unis. L’auteur constate que la demande en recherche universitaire est étonnamment faible ici — excepté dans certains secteurs
comme ceux des produits pharmaceutiques et de
l’équipement électronique —, la plupart des entreprises
canadiennes se tournant vers d’autres firmes pour se procurer des technologies brevetées. Ce qui confirme indirectement qu’elles ne trouvent pas ce qu’elles cherchent
dans les universités.
Pour qualifier cette zone grise entre l’offre et la demande
de technologies issues des universités, l’auteur parle de
« vallée de la mort », en raison d’un financement insuffisant
mais aussi d’attentes incompatibles. Pour les entreprises, les
universités représentent une source potentielle de technologies qu’il leur serait trop coûteux et risqué de développer au
stade initial. Mais dans le monde universitaire, les professeurs sont d’abord motivés par la publication de leurs
recherches dans des revues spécialisées qui privilégient l’originalité au détriment du potentiel commercial.
Au Canada, la majorité des efforts visant à trouver des
débouchés commerciaux aux technologies issues des universités passent par des bureaux universitaires de transfert de technologie. Ceux-ci ont pour tâche d’évaluer le
potentiel commercial des technologies, de protéger leur

Résumé
propriété intellectuelle, de répartir les redevances et de
chercher des exploitants de brevet, essentiellement selon
une approche d’offre-incitation. Mais ces bureaux ne possèdent ni la connaissance du marché ni les effectifs
nécessaires à un transfert efficace.
Jorge Niosi estimerait beaucoup plus fructueuse une
approche fondée sur la pression de la demande, selon laquelle
les entreprises sollicitent et stimulent la création des technologies issues des universités. Il fait valoir en ce sens
plusieurs initiatives américaines. Les programmes Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) et Small Business
Technology Transfer Research (STTR) assurent ainsi aux PME
un financement de démarrage pour le développement initial
de technologies mené en collaboration avec des chercheurs
universitaires. Et le Advanced Technology Program (ATP)
aide les entreprises, notamment en les associant directement
aux priorités de la recherche universitaire, à commercialiser
des technologies génériques. L’auteur précise toutefois qu’une
loi inspirée du Bayh-Dole Act de 1980, qui accorde des droits
de propriété intellectuelle aux inventeurs plutôt qu’aux
bailleurs de fonds, serait inefficace au Canada.
Dans le contexte canadien, toute approche du transfert
de technologie universités-entreprises fondée sur la pression de la demande devrait avoir pour premier objectif
d’associer les entreprises à l’élaboration des programmes de
recherche universitaire sans leur permettre d’en dicter tout
le contenu. Bon nombre des recommandations du Groupe
d’experts sur la commercialisation seraient donc inadaptées
à cet égard, puisque les décisions relatives aux technologies à financer resteraient réservées aux universités et aux
gouvernements. Aussi l’auteur propose-t-il de créer des
programmes inspirés du STTR et de l’ATP américains dans
le cadre de l’actuel Programme d’aide à la recherche industrielle, à la fois efficace et apprécié des intéressés.
Les deux commentatrices offrent le point de vue respectif du monde universitaire et des milieux d’affaires. Indira
Samarasekera, présidente de l’Université de l’Alberta,
souscrit à l’essentiel du diagnostic de l’auteur et propose de
rapprocher les PME des universités, puisque les partenariats universités-entreprises se limitent actuellement à un
petit nombre de grandes entreprises. Ilse Treurnicht, chef
de la direction du Centre d’innovation MaRS, observe que
le système d’innovation des États-Unis diffère sensiblement
du nôtre et que l’approche en série des programmes américains pourrait se révéler moins efficace au Canada. Mais
elle convient de l’importance cruciale d’associer les entreprises aux programmes de recherche universitaire, celles-ci
possédant une connaissance du marché qui fait défaut aux
universités et organismes subventionnaires.

<-----Page 31----->Summary
n this study, Jorge Niosi examines the channels by
which university-developed technologies are transferred to industry. Canada invests large sums in academic research, but the fruits of these investments are not
reflected in more industrial innovation and improved
productivity.
To frame the analysis, Niosi lays out a supply-demand
model of innovation according to which basic discoveries
and advances in frontier science ultimately bear fruit in the
form of commercially viable technologies. The supply side
is where ideas are organized into useful concepts, research
and discovery, and it is dominated by university research.
Because the economic benefits of such research are broad in
scope and difficult to predict, governments tend to be heavily involved in financing it. Using indicators such as investment in university research and development (R&D),
numbers of science and engineering graduates and scholarly publication rates, Niosi concludes that the supply side of
university technologies is reasonably healthy in Canada.
At the demand end of the university research pipeline,
businesses build on basic technologies to develop commercially profitable products or processes, which often require
complementary investments in R&D. Niosi points out that
several factors – notably Canada’s relatively small and geographically dispersed domestic market — work against
strong demand for technology here compared with in the
United States. Despite pockets of strength in the pharmaceutical and electronic equipment industries, demand for university research is surprisingly low. The author notes that
most Canadian companies turn to other firms for licensed
technology, which is circumstantial evidence that they are
not finding the technologies they need in universities.
Niosi terms the grey area between the supply and
demand of university-developed technologies the “valley of
death,” not only because of the paucity of funding, but also
because of mismatched expectations. From the perspective
of business, universities provide a potential vehicle for
developing early-stage technologies that would otherwise
be too risky and costly. However, from the perspective of
academia, professors are primarily motivated by scholarly
publication of their work, for which commercial potential is
typically much less important than originality.
Currently in Canada, most efforts to connect universitydeveloped technologies to potential commercialization
opportunities pass through academic offices of technology
transfer (OTTs). OTTs are charged with evaluating the com-

mercial potential of these technologies, securing appropriate
intellectual property protection and division of royalties, and
seeking out potential licensees — essentially a supply-push
approach. But they have neither the human resources nor the
market knowledge to provide effective technology transfer.
Niosi suggests that a demand-pull approach, by which
businesses seek out and cultivate university technologies,
would be much more useful, and points to several US initiatives that have proven effective. These include the
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small
Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs,
which provide seed funding to small- and medium-sized
enterprises for early-stage technology development in
cooperation with academic researchers. In addition, the
Advanced Technology Program (ATP) helps companies
commercialize generic technologies, in part by involving
them directly in university research priorities. By contrast, says Niosi, legislation along the lines of the landmark 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which grants intellectual
property rights to the inventors rather than the funders of
technologies, would be ineffective in Canada.
In the Canadian context, the key objective in developing
a demand-pull approach to university-industry technology
transfer would be to involve businesses in the development
of academic research agendas without allowing them to dictate those agendas entirely. Many of the Expert Panel on
Commercialization’s proposals are lacking in this regard,
because they would keep decisions about what technologies
to fund in the hands of universities and governments. The
author proposes that Canada create pilot programs along the
lines of the STTR and ATP under the rubric of the successful
and well-regarded Industrial Research Assistance Program.
Two commentators provide university and industry
practitioner perspectives. University of Alberta President
Indira Samarasekera broadly agrees with Niosi’s diagnosis
of the problem, and emphasizes that, given that universityindustry partnerships are currently limited to a small number of large firms, policies must better connect small and
medium-sized enterprises to universities. Ilse Treurnicht,
head of the MaRS innovation consortium, cautions that the
US innovation ecosystem is quite different from that of
Canada, which means that a cookie-cutter approach may
not be very effective. She agrees, however, that businesses
should be involved in developing academic research agendas, because they have the market knowledge that universities and granting councils lack.
