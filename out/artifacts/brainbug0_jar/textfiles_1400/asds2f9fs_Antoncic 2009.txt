personality characteristics of entrepreneurs (the big five
personality factors) and their firms’ technological
developments. More specifically key research objectives,
which are reflected in the structure of the paper, are the
following: (a) To develop a conceptual model (with
hypotheses) of entrepreneurs’ personality driven firm
technological developments. (b) To collect data on the model
elements and control variables. (c) To test the model
hypotheses using methods of quantitative analysis. (d) To
present and discuss the findings of the model. (e) To present
contributions and implications of the study.

Abstract—Technological newness and innovativeness are
important aspects of small firm development, growth and wealth
creation. The contribution of the study to entrepreneurship
personality research and to technology-related research in
entrepreneurship is that the model of the general personality driven
technological development was developed and empirically tested.
Hypotheses relating the big five personality factors (OCEAN:
openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and
neuroticism) and technological developments were tested by using
multiple regression analysis on survey data from a sample of 160
entrepreneurs from Slovenia. The model reveals two personality
factors, which are predictive of technological developments:
openness (positive impact) and neuroticism (negative impact). In
addition, a positive impact of firm age on technological
developments
was
found.
Other
personality
factors
(conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness) of entrepreneurs
may not be considered important for their firm technological
developments.

II. THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Making investments in developing technologies is important
for success of firms in industries with high technological
opportunities [11] and in other industries [6]. Technological
developments and innovation can be considered important
parts of corporate entrepreneurship, which has been also
referred to as intrapreneurship [12], [13], corporate venturing
[14] or internal corporate entrepreneurship [15]. Corporate
entrepreneurship, which is important for performance of firms
of all sizes [13], [16], [17] is defined as entrepreneurship
within an existing organization, including emergent
behavioral intentions and behaviors of an organization related
to departures from the customary way of doing things [18];
these entrepreneurial intentions and activities can have several
characteristic dimensions such as new business venturing,
product/service innovation, process innovation, self-renewal,
risk taking, proactiveness and competitive aggressiveness.
Corporate technological entrepreneurship can be considered
an important element of corporate entrepreneurship and has
been defined in terms of technological and process
innovativeness activities [9], where the emphasis is given on
development and innovation in technology [19], [20], [9].
Technological entrepreneurship can be defined as the
processes of assembling organizational resources, technical
systems and the strategies used by entrepreneurial firms to
follow opportunities [21].
Corporate technological
entrepreneurship can be mostly concerned with technologyrelated innovation [22], [9], where technology (a) can be
described as the collection of theoretical and practical
knowledge, know-how, skills and artifacts, which are used by
the firm for the development, production and delivery of
products and services and (b) can be embodied in people,
materials, facilities, procedures and processes [23]. The
definition of corporate technological entrepreneurship
includes a process within an existing organization in which

ECHNOLOGICAL newness and innovativeness are
important aspects of small firm development, growth and
wealth creation. The economic importance of innovation has
increased with the spread of the knowledge-based economy,
globalization and the pressure of international competition [1],
[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Technological innovativeness plays an
important role for firm performance in developed and
transition economies [7], [8], [9]. Small firm entrepreneurs are
central for performance of their firms and are usually crucial
decision makers for introduction of technological newness and
innovation. The personality of entrepreneurs may be crucial
for their small firm-related decisions [10]. In this paper a
relationship between the entrepreneurs’ general personality
traits and technological developments is investigated. This
study has an important scientific relevance, since it fills the
gap in research by including and testing the general
personality characteristics (the big five personality factors)
together with small firms’ technological developments in a
model.
Key research objectives of the study are to develop and
empirically test a model linking (through hypotheses) general

the key person – a technological entrepreneur – or a group of
technological entrepreneurs establish and manage a firm on
the basis of research, development, innovation and technology
[9].
The key persons – entrepreneurs, the people who start and
manage new businesses – can be considered responsible for
technology developments in small firms. Entrepreneurship is
based on personality of the entrepreneur [24]. Because of the
centrality of the person – entrepreneur – to entrepreneurship,
different personal characteristics of an entrepreneur have been
investigated in past research (for example, [25], [26], [27],
[28], [29], [30], [31], [10]). Brockhaus [25] presented an
overview of the psychology of the entrepreneur (including
also some classical researchers in entrepreneurship
personality, such as, for example McClelland [32] and Rotter
[33]) discussing the following psychological characteristics:
need for achievement, locus-of-control, risk-taking propensity,
and personal values (for example, need for independence and
effective leadership). Gartner [26] noted several personal
antecedents of entrepreneurial start-up and performance (need
for achievement, locus of control, risk-taking propensity,
autonomy, commitment, perseverance, vision, creativity,
single-mindedness, popularity, physical attractiveness,
sociability, intelligence, decisiveness, and diplomacy) but
expressed doubts in usefulness of entrepreneurship personality
research. Newer reviews and evaluations of entrepreneurship
personality research [24], [34], [35] suggest that personality
traits of entrepreneurs may be important for entrepreneurship.
In particular, insufficient entrepreneurship research attention
has been given to the general personality traits, such as the big
five personality factors [10]. Older and newer reviews of key
personality characteristics of entrepreneurs can be found, for
example, in writings of McClelland [32]; Brockhaus [25];
Baum et al. [24]; Rauch and Frese [34]; Chell [35]. In addition
to predominantly researched traits (for example, need for
achievement, internal locus of control, risk taking propensity,
need for independence) and other approaches to personality
(for example, entrepreneurial self-efficacy), the big five
factors of personality trait approach can be considered a
promising research area for linking personality characteristics
and entrepreneurship activities [31], [10]. Baum et al. [24] and
Chell [35] in their reviews call for more research about
personality of the entrepreneur.
Rauch and Frese [34] have distinguished two sets of
personality traits: broad (general) personality traits
(extraversion, emotional stability, openness to experience,
agreeableness, conscientiousness) and specific personality
traits (need for achievement, risk-taking, innovativeness,
autonomy, locus of control, self-efficacy); both can be related
to venture success. In this research the focus is on general
personality traits (the big five personality factors). In the big
five personality approach (for example, [36], 37]) five key
factors
were
identified
(OCEAN:
openness,
conscientiousness,
extraversion,
agreeableness,
and
neuroticism). The taxonomy-building regarding personality
traits were initiated by Allport and Odbert [38], folowed by
Cattell [39], and Norman [40], who identified five basic
factors. The big five factors (surgency, agreeableness,
conscientiousness, emotional stability and intellect) were

labeled by Goldberg [36], [37] and later relabeled so that the
first letters of the five factors are OCEAN (see [41]). The big
five personality factors can be described as follows ([42], in
[43], p. 239): (O) Openness, originality, open-mindedness
(traits, for example: artistic (+), insightful (+), intelligent (+),
commonplace (-), narrow interests (-), shallow (-)). (C)
conscientiousness, control, constraint (traits, for example:
deliberate (+), efficient (+), precise (+), careless (-), frivolous
(-), irresponsible (-)). (E) Extraversion, energy, enthusiasm
(traits, for example: adventurous (+), assertive (+), dominant
(+), sociable (+), quiet (-), reserved (-), retiring (-), shy (-)).
(A) Agreeableness, altruism, affection (traits, for example:
cooperative (+), generous (+), sympathetic (+), cruel (-),
quarrelsome (-), unfriendly (-)). (N) Neuroticism, negative
affectivity, nervousness (traits, for example: anxious (+), selfpitying (+), temperamental (+), calm (-), contented (-), stable
(-)).
The early relationship between openness and technological
newness, developments and innovation can be inferred from
the work of Schumpeter [44], who described entrepreneurs as
innovative and creative people. The creation of value through
innovation [45], the creation of something new [46],
innovativeness [18], and newness and originality [47] are
central to entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. Research on the
relationship between entrepreneurship and personality found
openness a significant factor [48], [31], [10]. On the basis of
the above research the following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 1: The openness factor will be positively related
to technological developments.
Some of the traits for personal and entrepreneurship success
(traits: strong, self-reliant, powerful, determined, independent,
rational, logical, unemotional, aggressive, and competitive;
Ryckman [49] labels them ‘ideal masculine Western society
traits’) may be found in or are very similar to traits which
relate to the conscientiousness factor. Entrepreneurs tend to
score higher than the population on the need for achievement
[32]. Conscientiousness can be characteristic of the
entrepreneur [48]. Conscientiousness traits, such as organized
and systematic [37, 50], practical [50], and efficient [37], [42]
can be important for technological developments. On the basis
of the above research the following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 2: The conscientiousness factor will be
positively related to technological developments.
Some of the traits for personal and entrepreneurship success
(traits: strong, self-reliant, powerful, determined, independent,
rational, logical, unemotional, aggressive, and competitive; [
49]) may be found in or are very similar to traits which relate
also to the extraversion factor. Extraversion can be
characteristic of the entrepreneur [48]. Entrepreneurs tend to
be optimistic [51]. Extraversion traits, such as optimistic [37],
active [37], and energetic [37], [50] can be important for
technological developments. On the basis of the above
research the following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 3: The extraversion factor will be positively
related to technological developments.
Traits of agreeableness may not be related to
entrepreneurship. Agreeableness items may be related to
entrepreneurship in two opposite (positive and negative)
directions, depending on the trait group [10]. Some

237

<-----Page 2----->World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 53 2009

agreeableness items from Goldberg [37] may form one group,
such as cooperative, helpful, patient, cordial, friendly, trustful
and diplomatic, whereas traits, such as combative, harsh,
bossy, demanding, domineering, manipulative, rude and
ruthless may form the other group. The first group may be
important for establishing good supportive relationships for
technological innovativeness [9], whereas the second group
may be also important for fast implementation of technology
development plans. Entrepreneurs can be seen as average in
extraversion [48]. On the basis of the above research the
following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 4: The agreeableness factor will not be related
to technological developments.
Neuroticism (the reverse of emotional stability) may be
negatively related to entrepreneurship activities and
orientations [31].
Autonomy or independence may be
important motivators for entrepreneurship [52], [46], [53],
[10], [54]. Un-emotionality may be crucial for personal
success [49]. Emotional stability traits (negative neuroticism),
such as autonomy, independence and individualism [37] can
be important for technological developments. On the basis of
the above research the following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 5: The neuroticism factor will be negatively
related to technological developments.
A model of personality driven technological development,
which includes the proposed hypotheses, is depicted in Fig. 1.

firm in the sample was 11 to 20 years old and operated in the
service industry. The distribution of the sample firms was
found to differ somewhat from the population in terms of the
small firm size distribution: a lower percentage of responses in
the sample than in the population was received from micro
firms with zero to nine employees and a higher percentage
from small firms with 11 to 50 employees. However, when
taken together, small firms are well represented – more than
90% in the sample and in the population. In the sample
different industries were well represented. Overall, the sample
may be considered adequately representative of the population
of Slovenian firms.
Measurement items for assessing independent and
dependent variables were previously tested and used in past
studies. Independent variables including the general
personality elements – the big five personality factors – were
measured by Saucier’s [50] Mini-Markers Inventory (also
used and tested in entrepreneurship by Singh and De Noble
[31]), which includes 8 adjectives per each personality factor:
(1) Openness adjectives: creative, imaginative, philosophical,
intellectual, complex, deep, uncreative (r), unintellectual (r).
(2) Conscientiousness adjectives: organized, efficient,
systematic, practical, disorganized (r), sloppy (r), inefficient
(r), careless (r). (3) Extraversion adjectives: talkative,
extraverted, bold, energetic, shy (r), quiet (r), bashful (r),
withdrawn (r). (4) Agreeableness adjectives: sympathetic,
warm, kind, cooperative, cold (r), unsympathetic (r), rude (r),
harsh (r). (5) Neuroticism adjectives: unenvious (r), relaxed
(r), moody, jealous, temperamental, envious, touchy, fretful.
Respondents reported the accuracy of the forty adjectives with
respect to themselves personally on the Likert-type scale with
anchors from 1-very untrue to 5-very true. The dependent
variable – technological developments – was measured on the
five-point Likert-type scale with anchors from 1-decreased
significantly to 5-increased significantly by one item (‘your
company’s
emphasis
on
pioneering
technological
developments in your industry’) from Zahra [19].
Respondents were also asked to check appropriate boxes for
two control variables (age of the person and the firm).
Exploratory factor analysis (Principal component analysis
with Varimax rotation) was used for testing the dimensional
structure of the big five personality factors. Confirmatory
factor analysis was not conducted given this measures are
already established in the field. The big five personality
variables were computed as the means of items for each
personality factor separately and standardized. Multiple
regression analysis was used for testing the hypotheses. The
big five personality variables and the two control variables
were used as independent variables in the regression equation
with the technological developments variable as the dependent
variable.

III. METHODS
The model was tested on 160 usable responses from a
sample of 166 entrepreneurs (67.3% male and 32.7% female).
Data were collected via face-to-face interaction-based
structured-questionnaire survey from entrepreneurs in
Slovenia. The typical entrepreneur in the sample was 30 to 40
years old; had 10 to 20 years of entrepreneurial experience
and was married. The typical firm in the sample was small
with 50 or less employees in the full-time equivalent (90.9%
firms in the sample), whereas about a half of the firms
(49.7%) had zero to ten employees (micro firms). The typical

Results of the multiple regression analysis are presented in
Table I. Hypothesis 1 proposed a positive relationship
between openness and technological developments. The
coefficient is substantial, positive and significant
(standardized coefficient 0.29, significant at 0.001). This

238

<-----Page 3----->World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 53 2009

finding is in support of Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 proposed a
positive relationship between conscientiousness and
technological developments. The coefficient is small, negative
and non-significant (standardized coefficient -0.04, sig.
0.667). This finding is not in support of Hypothesis 2.
Hypothesis 3 proposed a positive relationship between
extraversion and technological developments. The coefficient
is small, negative and non-significant (standardized coefficient
-0.07, sig. 0.430). This finding is not in support of Hypothesis
3. Hypothesis 4 proposed no relationship between
agreeableness and technological developments. The
coefficient is small, negative and non-significant (standardized
coefficient -0.09, sig. 0.254). This finding is in support of
Hypothesis 4. Hypothesis 5 proposed a negative relationship
between neuroticism and technological developments. The
coefficient is substantial, negative and significant
(standardized coefficient -0.19, significant at 0.018). This
finding is in support of Hypothesis 5. Overall, three out of five
hypotheses on the relationship between the general personality
traits and technological developments were supported, with
two of the big five personality factors having influence on
technological developments (openness – positive relationship,
neuroticism – negative relationship).
Two control variables were included in the model. Person
age was not found significant, whereas firm age was found
positively related to technological developments (standardized
coefficient 0.17, significant at 0.047).

A higher extent of pioneering of technological developments
in their industry may be expected from small firms, which are
not new, and whose entrepreneurs can be described with
openness and emotional stability (reverse of neuroticism)
traits, such as: (1-openness) creative, imaginative,
philosophical, intellectual, complex, deep, and (2-emotional
stability) relaxed, not moody, not jealous, not temperamental,
not envious, not touchy, and not fretful. Open and emotionally
stable entrepreneurs can have a greater probability of
pioneering more technological developments than their
entrepreneurial counterparts, who are less open and more
neurotic. Consequently, we predict that these personality traits
can have indirect effects on small firm performance, since past
research found a positive association between technological
innovation and developments and firm performance in terms
of growth and profitability (for example, [9]). Other
entrepreneurs’ personality factors (conscientiousness,
extraversion and agreeableness) may not be considered
important for their firm technological developments.
The study has implications for research and entrepreneurial
practice. Entrepreneurship scholars may like to consider using
the entrepreneur's general personality variables as crucial
elements of firm technological developments. In particular,
the big five personality factors should be given a greater
emphasis in predicting technology innovation and
development. In entrepreneurial practice it may be useful for
entrepreneurs to recognize the importance of their personality
for successful development of technology and in cases of
poorly fitting personality characteristics consider decisions to
include better personality fitting persons in their
entrepreneurial teams. In addition, entrepreneurship policymakers may like to consider promoting and enhancing some
personality factors (particularly openness and emotional
stability) early on in the educational system among children,
teens and young adults, who may still have the potential for
alterations in their general personality factors.
The study has some limitations. The study focused on the
general (big five) personality traits and did not include other
more specific personality-related elements. The data were
collected in one country, from small firm entrepreneurs. In
future research, additional tests and insights may be gained by
using samples from other countries. More longitudinal studies
may be conducted in future in order to establish predictability.
The focus of this study was on the general personality factors
of the entrepreneur, so other non-personality elements that
may be important for entrepreneurial technology decisions
were not included (for example sociological characteristics)
and can be used in future studies. Despite the limitations, this
study makes a contribution to the personality and technologyrelated research in entrepreneurship. The big five personality
factors can be important predictors of technological
developments.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The key finding of this study is that entrepreneurs’ big five
personality traits can be important for entrepreneurial
behavior of their small firms in terms of technological
developments. The contribution of the study to
entrepreneurship personality research and to technologyrelated research in entrepreneurship is that the model of the
general personality driven technological development was
developed and empirically tested.
The model reveals two personality factors, which are
predictive of technological developments: openness (positive
impact) and neuroticism (negative impact). In addition, firm
age can have positive impact on technological developments.
