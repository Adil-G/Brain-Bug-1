The current research evaluates the consistency of different constructs affecting risk taking in individuals’
experiential decisions across different levels of risk. Speciﬁcally, we contrast three major views concerning the psychological constructs that underlie risk taking behavior. The ﬁrst is the classical economic
approach which views risk as the sensitivity to differences in variance. The second is the latent-components approach suggesting the importance of sensitivity to losses and diminishing sensitivity to marginal
increases in payoffs. The third approach, risk acceptance, relates to the willingness to accept probable
outcomes over certainty. The results of three studies indicate that (1) Individuals do not exhibit consistency in their sensitivity to variance. (2) Consistent diminishing sensitivity is found within the gain and
loss domains, but across these domains individuals seem to be consistent only when deciding between
constant versus probable outcomes, suggesting that they reliably differ in their risk acceptance. (3) Risk
acceptance appears to entail different psychological constructs when the decision problem involves cooccurring gains and losses.

It is commonly believed that people differ in their risk preferences, and that such differences are stable across different situations (see Busemeyer & Stout, 2002; Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer,
1999; Douglas & Wildavsky, 1982; Kogan & Wallach, 1967; Sitkin
& Weingart, 1995; Weber, Blais, & Betz, 2002). Yet experimental
studies have typically documented inconsistency in individuals’
behavioral patterns of risk taking across different task conditions
(Keller, 1985; Schneider & Lopes, 1986; Schoemaker, 1990; Slovic,
1972) and domains of life (Soane & Chmiel, 2005; Weber et al.,
2002). Thus, the tension between the contextual constraints and
individual consistencies in risk taking seems far from being
resolved.
The discrepancy between the assertion of personal risk preferences and the inconsistencies highlighted by the behavioral data
is open for different interpretations. One interesting view is that
risk preference is in part a stable feature of personality or cognitive
style but it mostly reﬂects situational factors such as mood, feelings, and different decision framings (e.g., March & Shapira, 1987).
A more conventional approach suggests that apparently inconsistent risk-taking behavior may, in fact, reﬂect consistent sensitivity to latent components of risk taking. This interpretation implies
systematic changes in consistencies in risk taking and the emergence of inconsistencies that are predicted by the effect of latent
factors (see related ideas in Mischel & Shoda, 1995). The most

prominent example of this approach is prospect theory (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979) which explains contingent risk taking in different
domains by the assumption that subjective values (or utilities) are
based on relative judgments reﬂecting the effect of two main constructs: (a) loss aversion – the idea that losses loom larger than
equivalent gains and (b) diminishing sensitivity to marginal
changes in payoff – the assertion that the subjective impact of a
change in the absolute payoff decreases with the distance from
zero.1 Recent cognitive models of individual choice in decisions from
experience (see Hertwig et al., 2004)2 have adopted this approach by
implementing these factors as two core components of subjective
utility: (a) loss sensitivity – the assumption that individuals weigh
gains and losses in a consistent fashion (e.g., Busemeyer & Stout,
2002; Yechiam & Busemeyer, 2008; see also Worthy, Maddox, &
Markman, 2007) and (b) diminishing sensitivity – the assertion that
people are consistent in discounting payoff magnitudes with the distance from zero (Ahn, Busemeyer, Wagenmakers, & Stout, 2008;
Wallsten, Pleskac, & Lejuez, 2005).

1
Of course, risk perceptions are also affected by the subjective weighting of
probabilities as demonstrated by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Hertwig, Barron,
Weber, and Erev (2004). In order to isolate the factors associated with the value
function (effect of losses and size of payoff) we focus on equiprobable (.5) outcomes.
2
In such situations the decision maker is not given initial information concerning
the choice probabilities and outcomes, but rather has to learn them by acquiring
experience (by getting feedback after each choice).

We contrast this ‘‘latent constructs” approach with two alternative views. The ﬁrst is the classical economic approach that
addresses risk attitude as sensitivity to differences in payoff variances (e.g., Markowitz, 1952; Pratt, 1964; Sharpe, 1964; and see recent studies which relate brain activity with perceptions of risk as
variance, e.g., Preuschoff, Bossaerts, & Quartz, 2006; Preuschoff,
Quartz, & Bossaerts, 2008). We refer to it as the ‘‘sensitivity to variance” approach. The second is a recent view which suggests that
‘‘risk acceptance”, the tendency of people to prefer (or avoid) risk
over certainty is a single primitive construct that cannot be further
dissected into the effect of gains and losses and the effect of diminishing sensitivity, but does not necessarily reﬂect sensitivity to variance (Brachinger & Weber, 1997; Keller, Sarin, & Weber, 1986;
Schade, Kunreuther, & Kaas, 2004; Sokolowska & Pohorille, 2000).
There are different formulations of the risk-acceptance approach,
which, interestingly, has not been studied in the context of decisions from experience (the focus of the current analysis). We chose
to focus on a simpliﬁed interpretation of this approach, referring to
risk acceptance as the individual’s sensitivity to certain versus
probable outcomes. Under this formulation, risk acceptance can
be viewed as an extreme case of sensitivity to variance. That is, it
suggests that the difference in variance is a necessary but insufﬁcient condition of individual sensitivity to risk. The other necessary
condition for risk sensitivity is a situation activating the individual’s preference for certainty versus uncertainty.
Despite the different approaches of what constitutes risk preferences, behavioral measures of risk-taking behavior tend to be quite
uniform. In the vast majority of the aforementioned studies,
regardless of the implemented approach, risk taking is typically
operationalized as the rate of choice in (or preference for) the option which is associated with the higher outcome variability. We
follow this convention in our studies and analyses as well. Therefore, ‘‘risk taking” will be referred to as the rate of choice in the option with the higher variance. It should not be confused, however,
with the sensitivity to variance approach according to which differences in perceived variances modulate people’s sensitivity to risk.
The three aforementioned approaches are related but have distinct predictions that, surprisingly, have not been previously contrasted. The ﬁrst such prediction involves the consistency
between risk-taking propensities in the gain and loss domains. Under the latent-constructs approach, supposing that indeed diminishing sensitivity underlies risk taking between domains, a
negative association is expected between risk taking in the gain
and loss domains as implied by the reﬂection effect (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979). For example, if an individual discounts $1200
to a higher degree than he/she discounts $600 and is consistent
in this diminishing sensitivity then he/she should be risk averse
while choosing between a sure win of $600 and a bet with equal
chances to win $1200 or nothing, but should be risk seeking when
these values are framed as losses. In contrast, the sensitivity to variance approach predicts a positive correlation between risky
choices in the two domains, as individuals would either seek or
avoid variance in both domains.3 The risk-acceptance approach also
predicts positive correlation across domains but only when the
choice alternatives substantially differ in their levels of certainty.
These contrasting predictions are examined in Study 1.
A second distinction between the three approaches, which is
the focus of Study 2, involves the consistency of the weighting of

3
Seminal models that relate risk to variance (e.g., expected utility theory) assume
diminishing marginal returns (an early example is given by Bernouli (1878/1954))
which assumes that every additional dollar has less value to a consumer. Notice that
this abstraction leads to the same predictions as the diminishing sensitivity approach
in the gain domain but implies opposite patterns in the loss domain (see recent
discussion of the similarities and differences between these approaches in Wakker,
Köbberling, & Schwieren, 2007).

gains and losses. The latent-constructs approach assumes that
individuals differ primarily in their sensitivity to (weighting of)
gains and losses. This assertion implies a positive correlation between choice problems differing in the magnitudes of gains and
losses regardless of factors such as variance and certainty. In contrast, the sensitivity to variance approach predicts that the largest
consistencies would appear between problems where the alternatives have the same levels of variance. The risk-acceptance approach predicts choice consistency mostly when there are
distinguishable differences in levels of certainty, such as in the
choice between ﬁxed and probabilistic outcomes. Study 3 focuses
on the argument that risk acceptance involves a single primitive
construct, even when gain domain problems are contrasted with
choice problems involving both gains and losses.
Our comparison of different potential accounts for individual
consistency in risk taking across tasks is closely related to previous
studies of consistency in risk taking (e.g., Schoemaker, 1990; Slovic,
1972) and to studies that compared models of risk taking (e.g., Battalio, Kagel, & Jiranyakul, 1990; Lopes & Oden, 1999; Wakker et al.,
2007). There are two major differences from these previous studies: First, these studies have tended to focus on the latent-constructs approach and did not systematically investigate
alternative approaches to the psychological constructs underlying
risk sensitivity. Secondly, these studies have focused on one-shot
choices between described prospects (also known as ‘‘decisions
from description”) whereas we focus on risk taking in decisions
from experience (Hertwig et al., 2004). In such decisions, individuals do not get explicit information about the distributions that
underlie the alternatives they face (e.g., the probabilities and payoff sizes). However, by choosing repeatedly between the different
alternatives and realizing the outcome of each choice (which is
drawn from the relevant distribution) they can learn the potential
outcomes associated with each alternative and their likelihoods
(see Fig. 1). Previous studies have demonstrated that experiencebased decision tasks have many attractive features for studying
individual risk taking. It has been shown, for example, that such
tasks have high external validity in assessing individual differences
in decision making (e.g., Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson,
1994; Levin & Hart, 2003; Yechiam, Busemeyer, Stout, & Bechara,
2005) and that they are also relatively more resistant to social
desirability than decisions from description in which the gambles’

parameters are fully disclosed (Koritzky & Yechiam, 2010; Ronay &
Kim, 2006).4
Another interesting and relevant ﬁnding in decisions from
experience is that individuals do not seem to exhibit loss aversion
(Erev, Ert, & Yechiam, 2008; Erev et al., 2010; Hochman & Yechiam,
in press; Kermer, Driver-Linn, Wilson, & Gilbert, 2006; Koritzky &
Yechiam, 2010; Yechiam & Ert, 2007; see also Rozin & Royzman,
2001).5 Having these results, the reliance of cognitive models of
decisions from experience on loss sensitivity as a consistent latent
construct (e.g., Busemeyer & Stout, 2002; Yechiam et al., 2005)
may seem puzzling. However, since the studies that found no evidence of loss aversion in experience-based tasks focused on the
aggregate level (i.e., by averaging across participants), they still allow for the possibility of consistent loss sensitivity at the individual
level. Speciﬁcally, it might be that no loss aversion at the aggregate
level was found since some people are consistently ‘‘loss averse”,
while others are ‘‘loss seeking”, and these two types of individuals
cancel each other when their responses are aggregated. In Experiments 2 and 3 we examine this proposition by exploring whether
individuals can be consistent in their response to alternatives producing gains and losses even in the absence of loss aversion at the
aggregate level.
The results of our three studies indicate that the latent-constructs approach falls short from accounting for decisions from
experience, but so do the sensitivity to variance approach and
the risk-acceptance approach. We ﬁnd, instead, evidence for two
independent risk-acceptance factors: one for losses or gains, and
another for mixed outcomes. These ﬁndings raise important questions as to whether the latent-constructs and sensitivity to variance approaches can be used in modeling individuals’ risk
sensitivity.

1. Experiment 1: Bridges across domains: diminishing
sensitivity, sensitivity to variance, or risk acceptance?
As noted earlier, the latent-constructs approach is composed of
two main constructs: diminishing sensitivity (to marginal changes
in payoff) and loss aversion. The main purpose of our ﬁrst study
was to contrast the ‘‘diminishing sensitivity” assertion with the
sensitivity to variance and risk-acceptance approaches, by focusing
on the main implication of the diminishing sensitivity construct,
namely, the contingent risk taking in the gain and loss domains.
Each participant was presented with four repeated choice tasks,
as described in Table 1. Each task included two alternatives and
one (referred to as ‘‘L”) was always associated with lower variance
payoffs than the other (‘‘H”). The main within-subject manipulation pertained to the domain in which choices were made. In the
Gain condition choice alternatives yielded positive outcomes,
whereas in the Loss condition outcomes were negative.
In order to differentiate between the predictions of the sensitivity to variance and the risk-acceptance approaches, the tasks were
also distinguished with respect to the difference in their levels of
4
For example, Koritzky and Yechiam (2010) ﬁnd that asking students to make a
good impression (e.g., completing the tasks as part of a job interview) affects their
responses to popular personality questionnaires, as well as their risk taking in
decisions from description (the focus of Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), but does not
affect risk taking in decisions from experience.
5
This was demonstrated even when the payoffs are determined based on a
(randomly determined) single trial, suggesting that the phenomenon is not due to an
accumulation of payoff effect (Erev et al., 2008). Interestingly, recent studies of oneshot decisions from description show that even in these situations loss aversion is not
general (Ert & Erev, 2008; Ert & Erev, 2009; Simmons & Novemsky, 2008). These
studies show, for example, that loss-averse-like behavior occurs in speciﬁc situations
(e.g., when the risky alternative is offered as an alternative to a status quo; see Ert &
Erev, 2008), but not in others. These new ﬁndings suggest that loss aversion might be
context dependent rather than a general cognitive mechanism.

uncertainty. In two of the tasks selecting the safer option eliminated probabilistic outcomes. We refer to these tasks as the
‘‘Avoidable Uncertainty” (AU) condition. In the other two tasks
uncertainty could not be avoided since both alternatives included
probable outcomes. These tasks are referred to as the ‘‘Unavoidable
Uncertainty” (UU) condition.
The diminishing sensitivity assertion implies negative association between both domains in both the avoidable and the unavoidable uncertainty problems because high diminishing sensitivity
leads to risk seeking in the loss domain and risk aversion in the
gain domain. Notice that this assertion also implies positive correlations between the two gain problems, and between the two loss
problems. The risk-acceptance approach, however, suggests a positive association between the two avoidable uncertainty problems,
and no association between the two unavoidable uncertainty problems. In the avoidable uncertainty problems there are clearer environmental signals concerning the differences in uncertainty level
(in the form of the contrasting alternatives offering constant or
probable outcomes) which supposedly trigger risk-acceptance tendencies. Finally, the sensitivity to variance approach predicts positive association between all four choice problems due to one
option being higher in variance than the other, even in the
unavoidable uncertainty problems.

1.1. Method
Forty undergraduates (20 males and 20 females), from the faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management at the Technion,
participated in the experiment. The participants’ average age was
24 (ranging between 19 and 27). Payoffs ranged between NIS 14
and NIS 26 (NIS 1 = $4.5).
Each participant made 100 choices in each of the four choice
problems. The participants were informed that they would be playing different games in which they would operate ‘‘computerized
money machines” which include two unmarked buttons, and that
their ﬁnal payoffs would be sampled from one of the ‘‘machines”
but received no prior information about the payoff distribution
that underlies each alternative, and were not informed about the
number of trials (the complete instructions appear in Appendix
1). Their task was to select one of the machine’s two unmarked
buttons in each trial. The payoffs in each task were contingent
upon the button chosen and were randomly drawn from the relevant distributions described in Table 1. Speciﬁcally, on each trial a
payoff was randomly selected from the payoff distribution of the
selected alternative from the relevant problem. Final take-home
amounts were determined according to the accumulating score
in one choice problem that was randomly selected at the end of
the experiment. This was implemented to decrease potential noise
resulting from a diversiﬁcation bias (Ayal & Zakay, 2009; Rubinstein, 2000) and income effects across different tasks (Cho & Luce,
1995). The performance score was converted into cash money at a
rate of 0.01 agora per 1 point (1 agora = 0.24 cents). The ﬁnal payoff

was then determined by summing this amount with the participation fee (NIS 25). The overall length of the experiment was approximately 30 min.
Two types of feedback immediately followed each choice: (1)
the basic payoff for the choice, which appeared on the selected button for 2 s and (2) an accumulating payoff counter, which was displayed constantly, but was initialized at the beginning of each task.
The order of the Gain and Loss conditions was counterbalanced, and
the order of the two problems within each condition was randomized. The location of alternatives L and H was randomized across
different participants. The measure of risk taking used in each task
was simply the proportion of choices of H across trials. There are
therefore four variables in this study (and subsequent ones) conforming to the rate of H choices in each of the four choice problems.

1.2. Results
The choice proportions under the different conditions are summarized in the rightmost column of Table 1. The ﬁndings at the
aggregate level show that people took more risk (i.e., chose the H
option more frequently) in the loss domain than in the gain domain (t(39) = 3.98, p < .001). There were no signiﬁcant differences
in risk taking between the AU and the UU conditions
(t(39) = 1.41, NS).
The consistency of individuals’ risk taking across the different
tasks is presented in Table 2. The results show that in the AU condition there was a positive association between the gain and loss
domains (r = .45, p < .01), which stands in contrast to the diminishing sensitivity assertion, and supports the predictions of the riskacceptance approach. Taking the UU condition into account, the results show that in this condition there was no association between
the loss and gain domains (r = .03, NS), which further supports the
predictions of the risk-acceptance approach, since in the UU condition the probabilistic outcome could not be avoided (or accepted).6
In addition, the participants were consistent between the two
problems in the Gain condition (r = .63, p < .0001) and between
the two problems in the Loss condition (r = .32, p < .02), suggesting
that individuals might exhibit diminishing sensitivity to a certain
degree.
Therefore, it seems that the reﬂection effect, implied by the
diminishing sensitivity assertion, was not observed at the individual level. Instead, the participants exhibited a consistent preference between a constant outcome and a probable outcome
across the gain and loss domains. This suggests that risk acceptance modulates the consistency across the gain and loss domains
and that diminishing sensitivity alone cannot account for it.
Additionally, the suggestion that the consistent sensitivity to
risk is due to mere variance differences cannot account for the null
6
Arguably, the prospect theory value function allows for no correlation between
the gain and loss domains under the assumption that the degree of diminishing
sensitivity (the curvature of the value function) differs between gains and losses. Yet,
no variation of the model could explain the positive high correlations found across
these two domains under the AU condition.

correlations between gain and loss domain problems in the
Unavoidable Uncertainty condition. Still, the variance difference
in this condition was somewhat smaller than in the Avoidable
Uncertainty condition (and thus it could be argued that this produced lower correlations in this condition). In the next experiment
we examine problems that have the same exact differences in
variance.
2. Experiment 2: Contrasting loss sensitivity with risk
acceptance
The second experiment was designed to examine whether loss
sensitivity, the second proposed construct under the latent-constructs approach, indeed modulates risk-taking behavior in problems involving gains and losses, or whether its effect is due to
risk acceptance (or sensitivity to variance) as well. This was accomplished by contrasting two conditions involving losses and gains: A
condition with strong differences in uncertainty level (i.e., the participants could opt for not selecting the gamble and get a sure outcome of zero) and a condition where the differences in uncertainty
were smaller (i.e., selecting the safer option decreased the magnitude, but not the frequency of losses). We examined whether participants would still be consistent in their response to losses
(across two choice problems) in the latter condition.
Under the latent-constructs approach the loss-sensitivity construct involves pure sensitivity to the magnitude of losses compared to gains. Therefore, the consistency is expected to be
maintained regardless of the differences in uncertainty. Similarly,
under the sensitivity to variance approach a positive correlation
is expected to emerge as long as the alternatives maintain the
same difference in variance. However, under the risk-acceptance
approach consistency is only expected to emerge in the condition
where there are substantial differences in the level of uncertainty.
Each participant was presented with four repeated choice tasks,
as described in Table 3. The tasks involved two conditions differing
in the capacity of decision makers to avoid probabilistic outcomes.
In two of the tasks selecting the safer option eliminated the probability of losing. We refer to these tasks as the ‘‘Avoidable Uncertainty” (AU) condition. In the other two tasks uncertainty
differences between alternatives were smaller and both alternatives included possible losses occurring with the same frequency
(but differing in magnitude). Accordingly, these tasks are referred
to as the ‘‘Unavoidable Uncertainty” (UU) condition. A second within-subject manipulation pertained to the payoff magnitude. In condition ‘‘High Payoff” the size of all payoffs was doubled by ﬁve,
compared to the ‘‘Low Payoff” condition. Consequently, the standard deviation associated with alternative H (SD = 100) in the
Low-Payoff condition was one ﬁfth of that associated with the corresponding alternative in the High-Payoff condition (SD = 500). This
enabled us to evaluate the consistency across different levels of variance and compare the consistency in the AU and UU conditions.
Under the sensitivity to variance approach the highest correlations

<-----Page 4----->229

are expected between the two low-payoff problems, and the two
high-payoff problems. These pairs have the same variance differences between the H and L alternatives, as noted above.7

2.1. Method
Thirty (15 males and 15 females) Industrial Engineering and
Management undergraduate students participated in the experiment. The participants’ average age was 24 (ranging from 20 to
27). Payoffs were contingent upon the participants’ choices, varying between NIS 25 and NIS 33 (NIS 1 = $4.5).
The basic participation fee was NIS 30. The procedure and
instructions were identical to the one described in Experiment 1
(see Appendix 1) except that the experiment focused on the tasks
described in Table 3, and the conversion rate was 1 agora per 1
point (1 agora = 0.24 cents).
2.2. Results
The choice proportions under the different conditions are summarized in the rightmost column of Table 3. At the aggregate level
it seems that the participants tended to take more risk in the AU
than in the UU condition (t(29) = 3.15, p < .01). Additionally, in
both conditions the participants did not appear to exhibit loss
aversion: They did not make fewer selections, on average, from
the alternative (H) producing losses compared to the alternative
producing no losses (L) in the AU condition. Moreover, they did
not make fewer selections from the alternative producing relatively larger losses (H) in the UU condition. This is consistent with
previous ﬁndings in experience-based tasks (e.g., Erev et al., 2008;
Kermer et al., 2006; Yechiam & Ert, 2007).
The consistency of individuals’ risk taking across different tasks
is presented in Table 4. The results reveal that the participants
were highly consistent between the AU problems, in which risks
could be avoided (r = .54, p < .01) but not in the UU problems,
where risks could not be avoided (r = .13, NS).
Also, the participants did not show consistency across the two
high-payoff or low-payoff problems, inconsistently with implication of the sensitivity to variance approach. The correlations within
each of the two pairs of high and low payoff tasks were small
(r = .07, .13) and insigniﬁcant. This suggests that what makes the
participants respond consistently to high and low variance alternatives is not their mere variance.
This pattern suggests that the consistency in risk taking with
losses is not driven by an accounting balance that inﬂates gains
or losses (e.g., a weighted average of gain and loss amounts) nor
is it driven only by sensitivity to variance. Rather, the participants
were only consistent when a risky alternative involving losses and
gains was contrasted with a safe alternative offering a ﬁxed outcome. This indicates that the consistent construct in the mixed domain involves risk acceptance. Without strong signals of
differences in risk level in the form of constant versus probabilistic
outcomes, the correlation appears to disappear.
3. Experiment 3: A single risk-acceptance construct or a
different one for losses?
From the results of Experiments 1 and 2 one can conclude that
the main construct modulating people’s responses is risk acceptance. Yet an alternative suggestion is that while risk acceptance
consistently affects people’s responses, this is limited to situations
7
Alternatively, if the sensitivity to variance is only triggered for high variances, the
highest correlation is expected between the two high-payoff tasks, which have the
largest difference in variance between choice options (the same prediction is made in
Experiment 3; both predictions were refuted, however).

involving no explicit comparisons between gains and losses. Under
the latent-constructs approach, in the latter situation risk taking
(i.e., selecting the high variance option) is solely due to the weighting of gains and losses and not due to diminishing sensitivity (because diminished sensitivity is balanced when the gains and losses
are of the same magnitude). While the pure weighting of gains and
losses hypothesis was rejected in Experiment 2, it can still be argued that risk acceptance is an independent psychological construct when gains and losses are explicitly compared.
The goal of Experiment 3 was therefore to examine whether risk
acceptance is a single psychological construct or whether it implicates a second construct when the outcomes involve frequently
appearing similar gains and losses. This was conducted by comparing the consistency of risk taking across gain domain problems and
mixed domain problems (as shown in Table 5). As in study 2, a second within-subject manipulation pertained to the payoff magnitude. In condition ‘‘High Payoff” payoffs were doubled by two,
compared to the ‘‘Low Payoff” condition. Consequently in the
Low-Payoff condition alternative H was associated with a standard
deviation smaller by half than in the High-Payoff condition
(SD = 1000, 2000, respectively).
If risk acceptance is a single construct then we should expect
positive consistency across all four choice problems (in the gain
and mixed domains) since all of them involve a choice between a
constant outcome and probabilistic outcomes. In contrast, the latent-constructs approach predicts a correlation between the two
gain domain and the two mixed problems but no correlation across
domains. Finally, the sensitivity to variance approach again predicts that the highest correlations would be within the two highpayoff problems and low-payoff problems across domains.
3.1. Method
Fifty (25 males and 25 females) undergraduate students, from
the faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, participated in the experiment. The participants’ average age was 24
(ranging from 21 to 28). Payoffs were contingent upon the participants’ choices, varying between NIS 20 and NIS 30 (NIS 4.5 = USD
1). The procedure and instructions were identical to the one
described in Experiment 1 (see Appendix 1) except that the

experiment focused on the tasks described in Table 5. The conversion rate was 1 agora per 1 point (1 agora = 0.24 cents).
3.2. Results
The choice proportions under the different conditions are summarized in the rightmost column of Table 5. The results show that
people took more risk on average in the Mixed condition than in the
Gain condition both in the Low-Payoff condition (t(49) = 4.71,
p < .01) and High-Payoff condition (t(49) = 2.93, p < .05). This pattern is again inconsistent with loss aversion. It does replicate the
previous results in experience-based tasks (e.g., Erev et al., 2008).
Erev et al. (2008) interpreted the results in the gain domain by suggesting that when a risky alternative has large outcomes (i.e., in the
gain domain), these outcomes are discounted due to diminishing
sensitivity, leading to less risk taking than in an equivalent mixed
domain.
The consistency of individuals’ risk taking across the different
tasks is presented in Table 6. The results reveal that the participants
were highly consistent between the two mixed problems (r = .57,
p < .01) and between the two gain problems (r = .55, p < .01). However, the participants were not consistent across mixed and gain
problems: the association between the proportions of H choices
in the two domains was small (average r = .11) and insigniﬁcant.
These results do not support the predictions of the sensitivity to
variance approach, as the correlations between tasks with the
same difference in variance level were small and insigniﬁcant.
The results also cannot be explained under the assumption of a single risk-acceptance construct. Rather, there appears to be a separate construct for gains and losses of similar magnitudes.
Another interpretation of these results rests on the special case
of a constant outcome of zero. It might be that the Mixed condition
was dissociated from the Gain condition because decision makers
have a special psychological tendency to respond to the absolute
zero. In any event, it cannot be argued that a single construct of
risk acceptance modulates risk-taking behavior even if a constant
outcome is compared with a riskier one.
4. General discussion
The main purpose of the current study was to shed light on the
constructs leading to internal consistency in individuals’ risk taking in experience-based decisions. Three approaches were contrasted: one suggesting that loss sensitivity and diminishing
sensitivity are the main factors that underlie individual differences
in risk taking (see Ahn et al., 2008; Busemeyer & Stout, 2002;
Wallsten et al., 2005), the other suggesting that the acceptance
or the rejection of uncertainty is the principle factor modulating
people’s risk taking (e.g., Weber et al., 2002), and the third suggesting that sensitivity to differences in variance guides risk preferences (e.g., Pratt, 1964). To our knowledge, no previous studies
have systematically evaluated the contrasting predictions of these
approaches for the consistency of individual predispositions.

The results of Experiment 1 conﬁrmed the predictions of the
risk-acceptance approach for the consistency across domains (gain
versus loss outcomes). In particular, individual differences in risk
acceptance imply positive consistency across domains, such that
people who take risks with gains also take risks with losses. This
pattern contradicts the prediction based on the diminishing sensitivity, which implies a negative correlation across domains (as explained above). However, some consistency in diminishing
sensitivity was observed, as the participants exhibited high correlation between problems within the gain and loss domains (even
though they involved risks that could not be avoided). This shows
that individual differences in diminishing sensitivity in the current
context tend to be domain-speciﬁc (as previously proposed by
Abdellaoui, 2000), which seems to suggest that the construct of
diminishing sensitivity has a limited effect in driving consistency
across choice problems that are quite different.
Also in Experiment 1, the ﬁndings clearly showed the effect of
differences in uncertainty on individual consistencies across domains. The sensitivity to variance approach predicted positive consistency across the gain and loss domains regardless of differences
in uncertainty. However, consistency across domains was only observed for a condition where uncertainty was avoidable, as predicted by the risk- acceptance approach.
Experiment 2 focused on the construct of the sensitivity to gains
and losses. It was shown that when the choice problems implicate
differences in variance but no possibility of avoiding probabilistic
risks, no consistency appears at the individual level. This suggests
that in previous studies (e.g., Ahn et al., 2008; Yechiam & Busemeyer, 2008) what has appeared as consistency in the mere weighting
of gains and losses might actually be a form of risk acceptance.
Without a situation that contrasts certainty (i.e., constant outcomes) with some level of risk, the consistency of the sensitivity
to losses (compared to gains) is eliminated. This further supports
the notion of risk acceptance versus the latent-constructs approach.
Finally, the last experiment contrasted an assumption of a single ‘‘risk acceptance” primitive to the suggestion that when gains
and losses are explicitly compared, individuals’ consistencies
might differ. The results showed that indeed individuals’ risk taking was different for a mixed decision problem involving both
gains and losses and for a problem in the gain domain. This does
not imply complete domain speciﬁcity because we have seen, in
Study 1, a positive correlation between the gain and loss domains.
Rather, it implies that the Mixed condition with symmetric gains
and losses seems to involve an independent psychological construct. Further studies should examine whether this is due to the
explicit comparison of gains and losses or to preferences that involve zero outcomes.
The ﬁndings of the three studies have important implications
for the deﬁnition of subjective risk. Throughout the paper, and following the common convention in experimental studies of risky
decisions in general and decisions from experience in particular,
we have associated risk-taking behavior with choices of the option
with the higher variance as our point of departure. Nevertheless,
our ﬁndings show that differences in variances alone do not drive
individual consistencies in choosing the risky (higher variability)
option, suggesting that variance level does not solely determine
the subjective feeling of risk. Rather, we have highlighted a second
necessary condition: the presence of certainty.8 We view this
8
Interestingly even prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) allows certainty
to have special role by not deﬁning how extreme probabilities are perceived
subjectively. Wakker and Tversky (1995) ﬁlled this gap by assigning higher decision
weights to certainty. Although these abstractions cannot account for the current
results (e.g., the ‘‘reversed reﬂection” pattern in Study 1), they seem to support the
idea that certainty has a special role in risk perception. Another related idea is Payne’s
(2005) call for incorporating overall probabilities of winning and losing into models of
risk taking.

<-----Page 6----->E. Ert, E. Yechiam / Acta Psychologica 134 (2010) 225–232

ﬁnding as an example of a more general factor modulating individual
consistencies, involving the extent to which the alternatives differ in
their level of (un)certainty, with the case of certainty versus uncertainty being an extreme contrast along this axis. It appears that such
a contrast is necessary in order to obtain consistency in risk taking
even in problems that are relatively similar in terms of their payoff
domain (e.g., the mixed domain problems of Experiment 2).
Additionally, the current ﬁndings suggest that risky behavior
should be considered, at least to some extent, as being driven by
a cognitive style, as the correlations across choice problems
reached up to .60 in some cases. Of course, this can be interpreted
in a ‘‘half empty glass” eyes as well. For example, Slovic (1972)
found moderate correlations (up to .64) for risk-taking levels under
different elicitation methods (e.g., certainty equivalents versus
probability equivalents) and concluded that risk taking is to a large
extent a situational factor. However, when one compares the consistency of risk-taking levels to that observed for other behavioral
traits measured in different contexts, one does not get correlations
that are generally much higher. For example, in their seminal paper, Funder and Colvin (1991) obtained correlations that reached
up to .70 in individuals’ characteristic social behavior assessed in
different contexts.
Perhaps more importantly, the current ﬁndings clarify the conditions for where consistencies in risk taking are expected to run
high. They suggest that the crucial factor in this respect is the differences in uncertainty level between the available alternatives. A
condition that is particularly conducive to behavioral consistency
in this respect is when a constant outcome is contrasted with a risky outcome.
In addition to clarifying the psychological constructs modulating consistent risk-taking behavior, the current ﬁndings also shed
light on the value and limitations of complex decision tasks used
for assessing individual differences in risk taking. Experimental
decision tasks that have been shown to possess high external validity, such as the Iowa Gambling Task (see Bechara et al., 1994), the
Lane Task (Lane, Cherek, Pietras, & Tcheremissine, 2004), and the
Go/No-go Discrimination Task (Newman, Widom, & Nathan,
1985) have an interesting common feature, in that they include
the possibility of eliminating or signiﬁcantly reducing the level of
uncertainty. This is justiﬁed by the ﬁnding that unavoidable uncertainties indeed impair the consistency in risk taking exhibited
otherwise. One should also note, though, that these complex tasks
often have both gains and losses, implying that they study just one
facet of risk acceptance. Studying risk acceptance in pure gain and
loss domains (e.g., as in Levin & Hart, 2003) might yield another
interesting and potentially important dimension of individuals’
risk-taking preferences.

5. Conclusions
As in the previous examinations of individual risk taking, this
construct was found to be consistent only in limited settings (Keller, 1985; Schneider & Lopes, 1986; Slovic, 1972). Only in 6 of 18
possible comparisons between simple experiential decision tasks
did the participants exhibit consistency in their risk-taking levels.
Yet the current analysis also shows that the consistencies found
are far from being coincidental, and it sheds light on the factors
that modulate this behavioral consistency. A construct that seems
to trigger the consistent tendency to take risk is the ‘‘risk acceptance” factor denoting individuals’ sensitivity to differences in risk
level when such differences are clearly perceived (such as in a decision between a constant outcome and a riskier prospect). When
differences in risk level are less clear, lower consistency between
different decision problems is observed.

Appendix 1. Complete instructions
Initial instructions
‘‘In this experiment you will play several different games, independent of each other. In each game you will be operating a ‘computerized money machine’ that includes two unmarked buttons.
Pressing on a button will result in a gain or a loss of several points,
which will be set according to the button chosen. Your objective in
this experiment is to earn as many points as you can. There might
be differences between the buttons regarding the gains and losses
that each one might produce. At the end of the session one game
will be randomly selected. Your ﬁnal payoff will be the sum of
the points you earned in that game. Each point will be converted
to 1 agora”.9

Instruction screen before the beginning of each of the tasks
‘‘Notice, you are about to begin a new game. This game is different from the previous game. Good luck.”
Following this instruction screen was a 30-s pause before the
participants could start the new task.
At the end of the experiment the participants were told which
game was selected randomly and were informed of their ﬁnal payoff (the payoff earned in the selected game).
