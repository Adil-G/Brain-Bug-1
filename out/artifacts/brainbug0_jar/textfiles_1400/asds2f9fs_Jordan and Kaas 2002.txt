Abstract Eﬀective advertising strategies are of growing importance in the mutual fund
industry due to keen competition and changes in market structure. But the dominant
variables in ﬁnancial decision making, investor’s perceived investment risk and expected
return, have not yet been analysed in an advertising context, although these productrelated evaluations can be inﬂuenced by advertising and therefore serve as additional
indicators of advertising eﬀectiveness. In this study, the authors use a large-scale
experimental study (n=499) to detect how risk-return assessments of private investors
are inﬂuenced by speciﬁc elements of print ads. In this context, judgmental heuristics
used systematically by private investors play a crucial role.

During the 1990s, the mutual fund

are of great importance in the mutual
fund business, and advertising has become
an important marketing instrument to
attract fund sales.3,4 Accordingly,
advertising expenditures of mutual fund
companies increased signiﬁcantly in the
last years. In Germany, they rose to

C
in 2001, which is more than
twice as high as three years before
(C
=66.75m).5 Similar developments can be
found in other European countries and in
the USA. But what is known about the
way advertising works in the mutual fund
business? There is no doubt that many

investment products too, for instance the
attainment of brand awareness or the
creation of emotional experiences through
advertising. There are, however, special
features of investment products which
advertising research should analyse
explicitly. Above all, investment decisions
are characterised by high exogenous
uncertainty, as future product performance
must be estimated from a set of noisy and
vague variables. So investors’ expectations
about uncertain future events play a
crucial role in investment decision
making.6 Most importantly, purchase
decisions in investment markets follow
two dominant criteria: perceived
investment risk and expected return,
constructs which apply exclusively to
investment products. Risk and return are
crucial variables in ﬁnancial decision
making, as indicated in the fundamental
normative model of investment behaviour,
the mean-variance portfolio analysis.7
Financial services advertising should aim
to inﬂuence positively investors’
perceptions of these product-speciﬁc
decision criteria. This paper delivers
theoretical and empirical insights into the
inﬂuence of advertising on private
investors’ risk-return perceptions.
Hypotheses are tested by means of a largescale experimental study, and practical
implications are deduced in the last section
of the paper.
RISK-RETURN PERCEPTIONS AS
VARIABLES OF ADVERTISING
EFFECTS
Risk perception and return estimations are
crucial constructs in the context of
ﬁnancial decision making.8-10 Traditional
behavioural advertising research, however,
focuses on rather general categories of
advertising eﬀects, like awareness, recall or
attitude change.11,12 Regarding investment
products, private investors’ risk-return
perceptions should be treated as additional,

product-speciﬁc variables of advertising
eﬀectiveness in order to understand and
optimise advertising’s persuasive impact in
this special business.
In ﬁnance theory, investment risk is
considered a precise, abstract and purely
technical statistical concept. This risk
concept, however, does not reﬂect private
investors’ understanding of risk; they have
a more intuitive, less quantitative, rather
emotionally driven risk perception.13
Empirical studies that deal with investors’
risk perceptions detect four diﬀerent
dimensions of perceived risk:9,10,13
— Downside risk: the perceived risk of
suﬀering ﬁnancial losses due to negative
deviations of returns, starting from an
individual reference point
— Upside risk: the perceived chance of
realising higher-than-average returns,
starting from an individual reference
point
— Volatility: the perceived ﬂuctuations of
returns over time
— Ambiguity: a subjective feeling of
uncertainty due to lack of information
and lack of competence.
These diﬀerent aspects have to be taken
into account, as single item measures lead
to an incomplete and simpliﬁed
measurement of the perceived risk
construct.14 Expected return, on the other
hand, is a simpler, one-dimensional
numerical construct, which can be
measured in absolute or relative terms or
in intuitively quantitative evaluations.9
RELEVANCE OF PRIVATE INVESTORS’
JUDGMENTAL HEURISTICS FOR RISKRETURN PERCEPTIONS AND
ADVERTISING CONTENT
Behavioural ﬁnance, a ﬁeld of research at
the interface of economics, ﬁnance and
psychology, is a relatively new paradigm
and was developed in the late 1980s in the

# Henry Stewart Publications 1363–0539 (2002)

<-----Page 2----->Advertising in the mutual fund business

USA due to mounting empirical evidence
that existing ﬁnancial theories appeared to
be deﬁcient in a real market setting.15-17
Contrary to the normative approach of
classical portfolio theory, behavioural
ﬁnance deals with the descriptive analysis
of actual behaviour of individuals in
ﬁnancial markets and analyses
psychological inﬂuences on information
processing and ﬁnancial decision making.
The typical investor is considered to be a
‘homo heuristicus’ rather than a ‘homo
economicus’ who makes use of
judgmental heuristics in information
processing and decision making instead of
formal statistical analysis. Judgmental
heuristics are abridged, often sub-optimal
information processing strategies, so-called
‘mental shortcuts’ or ‘rules of thumb’
which are used systematically but often
unconsciously to simplify decision
making.17 Heuristics like the anchoring
heuristic, the representativeness heuristic,
the availability heuristic or framing lead to

biases in the perception of risks and
returns.18 So if advertising content evokes
the use of judgmental heuristics,
advertising will inﬂuence investors’ riskreturn perceptions by means of those
heuristics (see Figure 1).
In the next sections, the authors brieﬂy
discuss two cognitive heuristics and one
aﬀect-based heuristic and deduce the
implications for advertising eﬀects. The
heuristics were chosen on the basis of their
practical relevance in actual mutual fund
advertising.
Anchoring heuristic
While making forecasts, predictions or
probability assessments like risk-return
evaluations of mutual funds, people tend
to rely on a numerical anchor value which
is explicitly or implicitly presented to
them.19,20 Anchoring eﬀects are not
restricted to numerical values with a
logical coherence to the subsequent

numeric estimate. According to the socalled ‘basic anchoring eﬀect’21 any
random and uninformative starting point
might represent an initial anchor value
which leads to biases in forecasts and
estimates of the value of that initial
starting point. Anchoring eﬀects have been
identiﬁed in many empirical studies and in
various decision ﬁelds.22 This robust
judgmental heuristic is of particular
relevance in ﬁnancial markets, where it
applies to any ﬁnancial forecast (eg stock
market prices), leading to severe biases.
In practice, numerical data play an
important role in the informative content
of mutual fund ads. Almost every print ad
and many television spots highlight ﬁgures
like past performance data, assets under
management, distribution of dividends etc.
In addition to direct anchor values (these
are anchors that evoke direct associations
with risks and returns, eg ‘10 per cent’,
‘10bn euro’), indirect anchor values with
dimensions other than return or monetary
units, eg ‘15,000 research specialists
worldwide’, ‘Value Basket 25 Fund’,
‘1,000 dreams come true’) can also exert
an inﬂuence on estimates. In accordance
with the anchoring heuristic, even those
irrelevant ﬁgures will distort returnperceptions of the anchor value when they
are prominently highlighted in the ad.
H1: A low anchor value in an ad will lead to
a lower return estimation, compared to a high
anchor value, even when the anchor is
uninformative in nature.
Representativeness heuristic
People tend to rely on stereotypes. They
judge the likelihood of an event in
accordance to its ﬁtting into a previously
established schema or mental model. They
consistently judge the event that seems to
be the more representative to be the more
likely, without considering the prior
probability, or base-rate frequency of the

132

outcomes.23 Representativeness is a
commonly used and very problematic
heuristic in ﬁnancial markets, as it leads to
a misinterpretation of empirical or causal
coherence.24 Illusory correlation, betting
on trends, naı̈ve causality, misperception
of randomness and other related biases in
the use of judgment criteria are typical
consequences. For instance, past
performance data and trend patterns of
mutual funds’ performance charts are
extrapolated into the future without
considering the exogenous uncertainty and
randomness of ﬁnancial markets.25,26
In terms of practice, mutual fund ads
suggestively promote stereotype thinking
by communicating positive past
performance data, fund ratings and fund
awards, and by pointing out speciﬁc brand
values like trustworthiness, competence
and experience. Due to stereotypical
thinking (thinking in brand associations
and brand schemata), risk-return
perceptions of private investors will
heavily depend on the investment
company that stands behind the
investment product. With regard to
investment products, however, investors’
reliance on brand images or brand
stereotypes in the evaluation of risks and
returns is a severe anomaly, as strong
brands cannot serve as a warranty for high
returns or low risks due to the exogenous
uncertainty of ﬁnancial markets.
H2: A well-known investment company with
a clearly positive brand image will evoke better
risk-return perceptions at the product level
compared to a relatively unknown investment
company lacking a clear and positive brand
image proﬁle, although identical products are
advertised and identical product information is
provided.
Aﬀect heuristic
Modern ﬁnancial theory increasingly
recognises the fact that ﬁnancial decision

# Henry Stewart Publications 1363–0539 (2002)

<-----Page 4----->Advertising in the mutual fund business

making is also determined by aﬀective
states.15 Negative emotions like fear,
worry, anger or shame, and positively
experienced emotions like hope, greed,
pleasure and joy may inﬂuence risk-return
perceptions and investment behaviour.27,28
A direct inﬂuence of emotions on risk
perception and expected returns can be
deduced from the ‘aﬀect heuristic’29 which
postulates that perceptions of risks and
beneﬁts of an alternative are derived from
global aﬀective evaluations and
associations. If a stimulus arouses a positive
aﬀective impression, the decision maker
will judge the risks related to this
alternative to be lower and the beneﬁts (eg
returns) to be higher, compared to neutral
emotional states. If a stimulus is associated
with negative aﬀective impressions, the
opposite eﬀect will occur: risks are judged
to be higher, the returns, on the other
hand, to be lower. In practice, mutual
fund ads most often contain emotional
pictures and emotional slogans as well as
product information. In terms of the aﬀect
heuristic, these emotional elements exert a
direct inﬂuence on investors’ risk-return
perceptions if they succeed in evoking
positive aﬀective impressions of the mutual
fund.
H3: If the emotional content in the ad
(pictures, slogans, tonality) succeeds in evoking
positive aﬀective impressions of the advertised
mutual fund, the investor will judge the
investment risk to be lower and the return to
be higher than a purely informative ad.
The moderating impact of private
investors’ expertise
It is important to discuss possible
moderating factors in the use of heuristics.
Do only inexperienced, uninformed
investors use these heuristics, or are they
also applied by novice and expert
investors? The question whether or not
knowledge has an inﬂuence on heuristic

Vol. 7, 2 129–140

information processing has been
controversially discussed. Some researchers
underline the unconsciousness and
automatism of judgmental heuristics,
implying that both lay and expert
investors systematically make use of
them.20 Indeed, some empirical ﬁndings
reveal that investors’ expertise has no
inﬂuence on the use of judgmental
heuristics.30,31 Others, however,
demonstrate the moderating role of
individuals’ knowledge, stating that
knowledgeable persons do not apply
judgmental heuristics, or only to a
moderate extent. 21,32
H4: Investors’ knowledge of investment
products moderates the use of heuristics.
EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
Method
Design
Hypotheses were explored with a largescale 2626262 factorial betweensubjects design (see Table 1). Speciﬁc
graphical elements of the ad represented
the experimental factors and were
systematically varied to test for possible
interaction eﬀects.
Investors’ expertise as a separate
experimental factor was controlled by expost blocking of the experimental groups.
In accordance with their subjective selfassessment of their knowledge and
experience with mutual funds and
investment products, participants were
blocked into informed and uninformed
investors after the experiment.
Stimuli
The advertising stimulus was a print ad
promoting a large European company and
a mid-cap mutual fund. Each experimental
group was presented with a diﬀerent
version of the print ad representing the
systematically varied experimental factors,

according to the experimental design.
Apart from those experimentally
manipulated factors, all ads were identical,
containing the same product information
and communicating the same risk-return
proﬁle of the mutual fund.
According to the ‘basic anchoring
eﬀect’21 the anchor value in the ad was an
uninformative, irrelevant numerical value,
included in the ad as an integral part of
the mutual fund’s name (low anchor: Euro
Star 100 FundTM, high anchor: Euro Star
500 FundTM). The mutual fund’s name
was a striking element of the ad. Besides
the product information, emotional ads
included an emotional image and an
emotional claim. The non-emotional ad,
on the other hand, did not contain any
emotional elements, only emotionally
neutral visual background elements and
claims. To test for representativeness
eﬀects, half of the ads contained the brand
logo of a large, well-known German
investment company (DWS Investments),
the other half contained the brand logo of
a large but, in Germany, mainly unknown
American investment company (Fidelity
Investments).
Participants and procedure
The experimental study was carried out
with advanced business students of
Frankfurt University, Germany, during

134

Journal of Financial Services Marketing

Vol. 7, 2 129–140

December 2001. In the authors’ opinion
advanced business students are a good
proxy for private investors. Preliminary
studies demonstrated that most of the
students are interested in investment
products and invest regularly in mutual
funds and other ﬁnancial assets, although
the amount they spend is still small.
Moreover, Fidelity Investments asserted
that students with an aﬃnity to business
and ﬁnance are an important part of their
target group due to their future ﬁnancial
potential. After watching the print ad, the
students were asked to ﬁll out a
questionnaire containing the following
dependent variables:
Measures
— Perceived risk: four items and ﬁve-point
scales labelled from 1 = ‘I fully
disagree’ to 5 = ‘I fully agree’ were
used to measure the diﬀerent aspects of
the risk construct (see Appendix for
scales and items). To form an aggregate
risk score, factor scores were calculated
(as the four items loaded on one factor
that the authors called ‘risk
perception’). For better interpretation,
the authors also calculated the sum of
the risk scores.
— Expected return: participants had to
estimate the mutual fund’s average rate
of return per year for the next few years.

<-----Page 6----->Advertising in the mutual fund business

Additionally, participants’ subjective
knowledge and experience with regard to
investment decisions were measured via
subjective self-assessment. Questions
capturing brand image, brand awareness
and emotional evaluation of the mutual
fund completed the questionnaire in order
to comprehend and reconstruct relevant
heuristic inﬂuences.
RESULTS
The impact of the anchoring heuristic
In the case of the low anchor value (Euro
Star 100 FundTM) investors’ mean expected
return estimation was 11.8 per cent, in the
case of the high anchor value (Euro Star
500 FundTM) it was 22.6 per cent. As these
results indicate, return evaluations are
signiﬁcantly distorted by anchor size. An
analysis of variance revealed a signiﬁcant
main eﬀect (F(1, 483)= 122,371, p <
0.01) with strong eﬀect size33 (eta2 =
0.202). These results demonstrate the ‘basic
anchoring eﬀect’. Uninformative and
implicitly presented anchor values without
logical coherence to the estimate are able
to bias return perceptions signiﬁcantly. A
signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the anchor size on
perceived investment risk could not be
detected.
The impact of the representativeness
heuristic
The use of diﬀerent brand logos (Fidelity
Investments vs DWS Investments) in the
print ad and, correspondingly, the
evocation of varying brand stereotypes,
had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on expected
return. The direct numeric estimate was
obviously not aﬀected by variations in
associated brand image. But there was a
signiﬁcant (F(1, 483)=530,956, p < 0.01)
and large (eta2= 0.524) main eﬀect of the
brand logo on perceived investment risk.
Integration of the brand logo Fidelity led

# Henry Stewart Publications 1363–0539 (2002)

Vol. 7, 2 129–140

to a mean factor score of perceived risk of
0.63 (mean summed score: 6,855), the
DWS logo led to a mean factor score of
–0.634 (mean summed score: 3.54). So
participants perceived investment risk as
lower when the mutual fund was oﬀered
by the DWS brand, although the same
product information and risk-return
proﬁle was communicated. Apparently,
thinking in brand stereotypes (brand
associations) leads to biases in risk
perception. Further analyses support these
results. The image of the DWS brand was
judged better (mean: 26.8) than the brand
image of Fidelity (mean: 18.7), t=–16.291,
p < 0.01. Similarly, brand awareness of
DWS was higher (mean: 4.3) than that of
Fidelity (mean: 2.4), t=–18.038, p< 0.01.
To sum up, thinking in brand stereotypes
associated by higher awareness of the
corporate brand, is able to bias perceived
investment risk at the product level. Good
brand image and high brand awareness
result in a lower perception of investment
risk.
The impact of the aﬀect heuristic
Emotional content of the print ad had no
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on expected return.
Apparently, direct numeric estimates are
not distorted by emotional elements in the
ad. But again, analysis of variance revealed
a signiﬁcant (F(1, 483)=274,107, p <
0.01) and strong (eta2= 0.362) main eﬀect
of emotional content on risk perception.
The emotional ads resulted in a mean
factor score of perceived risk of –0.456
(mean summed score: 3,997), the nonemotional ads, on the other hand, led to a
mean factor score of 0.452 (mean summed
score: 6,397). Thus emotional elements in
the ad evoke a decrease in investment risk
perception. Further analyses illuminate
these emotional eﬀects. Investors’ aﬀective
evaluation of the advertised mutual fund
(‘I have a good feeling with regard to this
mutual fund’) was better when emotional

0.045) main eﬀect of participants’
competence on perceived risk. Informed
participants showed lower risk perceptions
than uninformed participants. The mean
factor score of uninformed participants
was 0.128 (mean summed score: 5,626);
that of knowledgeable participants was
–0.132 (mean summed score: 4,768). This
result is probably due to the perceived
ambiguity in the evaluation of risky
alternatives. This special aspect of risk
perception (second perceived risk item, see
Appendix) is directly connected with
participants’ subjective knowledge and
information supply. The degree of
perceived ambiguity diﬀered clearly
between uninformed and informed
participants, as separate analyses of
variance on each aspect of perceived risk
revealed. Informed participants
experienced lower ambiguity (mean: 2.5)

On average, participants low in

Furthermore, there was a signiﬁcant (F (1,

(large eﬀect).
Figure 2 shows the interaction eﬀects
between participants’ expertise and the use
of heuristics. As an analysis of variance
revealed, the biasing eﬀect of the
anchoring heuristic was larger for
uninformed participants than for more
knowledgeable participants. This result is
very important, as it reveals that both
informed and uninformed investors do use
heuristics, but uninformed investors show
biases which are greater in magnitude.
This magnitude eﬀect also applies to the
aﬀect heuristic. The biasing eﬀect of
emotional content on risk perception was
larger for uninformed participants than for
informed participants. Furthermore,
thinking in brand stereotypes led to more
severe eﬀects on risk perception in the case
of uninformed investors. The diﬀerence in
risk perception due to integration of
various brand logos was larger for
uninformed participants. Further analyses
revealed that knowledgeable participants
perceived smaller diﬀerences in brand
images between Fidelity (mean: 21.5) and
DWS (mean: 27.0), t=–7.736, p < 0.01
than uninformed participants (mean
Fidelity: 16.2, mean DWS: 26.5), t=
–16.857, p < 0.01. Similar eﬀects can be
found with regard to brand awareness.
Brand awareness diﬀerences between
Fidelity and DWS were smaller for
informed participants (mean Fidelity: 3.1,
mean DWS: 4.6, t=–9.854, p < 0.01)
than for uninformed participants (mean
Fidelity: 1.8, mean DWS: 4.0, t=–18.565,
p < 0.01). As a consequence, these
diﬀerences in brand associations and brand
awareness led to varying eﬀects on risk
perception. The results underline the
ﬁnding that although both informed and
uninformed participants make use of
heuristics, the biases are greater for less
knowledgeable participants.
Apart from these interaction eﬀects

Vol. 7, 2 129–140

between participants’ expertise and the use
of heuristics, no other interaction eﬀects
were found.
Conclusion
Anchoring, representativeness and the
aﬀect heuristic are used by private
investors in an advertising context which
leads to biases in risk return judgments,
with the following restrictions:
— Anchoring eﬀects only occur in the
case of expected return, ie direct
numeric estimates
— The aﬀect heuristic and the
representativeness heuristic only aﬀect
perceived investment risk
— The referred judgmental heuristics are
found in both groups, informed and
uninformed investors, but the latter
show larger biases than informed
investors.
DISCUSSION
Advertising in the mutual fund industry
may become more eﬀective if advertising
ﬁrms are aware of and apply theoretical
and empirical insights of behavioural
ﬁnance theory, especially regarding
investors’ systematic use of judgmental
heuristics in the evaluation of risk and
return.
Besides more general variables of
advertising eﬀects, it is reasonable to
consider private investors’ risk-return
perceptions as additional, product-speciﬁc
variables of advertising eﬀects in the
mutual fund industry in order to
understand and optimise advertising
eﬀectiveness.
Private investors make use of
judgmental heuristics during the processing
of advertising stimuli, regardless of their
expertise in investment decisions.
Uninformed investors, however, make use
of heuristics to a larger extent, resulting in

Journal of Financial Services Marketing

137

<-----Page 9----->Jordan and Kaas

larger biases in the perception of risks and
returns. This ﬁnding highlights the
necessity of target group- or market
segment-speciﬁc advertising strategies in
the investment industry, as diﬀerences in
knowledge and experiences lead to
diﬀerent risk-return perceptions.
Numerical values in print ads serve as
anchor values and bias expected returns,
even when there is no logical connection
between anchor value and return
estimation. Therefore, prominent numbers
and ﬁgures in mutual fund ads have to be
integrated very carefully, with full
awareness of their potential biasing
inﬂuence.
Brand awareness and brand image play
a central role in the processing of ads, as
they are able to distort private investors’
risk perception at the product level.
Investment risk is judged lower if a highly
reputable and well-known investment
company oﬀers the advertised mutual
fund. As a consequence, investing in brand
equity is very important.
Private investors’ risk perceptions are
inﬂuenced by emotional states. Emotional
stimuli in the ad not only lead to a more
favourable, positive aﬀective evaluation of
the advertised mutual fund, but also to a
lower perception of investment risk
compared to a merely informative
advertising style. This ﬁnding indicates
that emotional advertising is an eﬀective
tool, even in the abstract, rational, riskreturn-oriented investment industry.
APPENDIX
Measures/scales
Risk perception:
1 ‘This mutual fund bears a high risk of
losing money or of missing personal
investment objectives’ (downside risk)
2 ‘I feel uncertain about investing in this
mutual fund, as I feel uninformed and
incompetent about it.’ (ambiguity)

‘Investing in this fund also entails good
chances to realise higher, above-average
returns’ (upside risk)
‘Regarding this mutual fund, I reckon
there will be signiﬁcant performance
variations over time’ (volatility)

Expected return as a direct numeric estimate
was captured by the following question:
‘Please estimate the mutual fund’s average
rate of return per year (time horizon: the
next few years): on average _____ % per
year.’
Investors’ expertise in investment decisions
and mutual funds, consisting of subjective
knowledge and experiences 34,35 was
measured by four items:
1

‘How do you assess your knowledge
about mutual funds?’
(ﬁve-point scale, labelled from 1=‘I
have very small knowledge’ to 5=‘I
have a lot of knowledge’)
‘Please evaluate to what extent you
have already gained experiences with
mutual fund investments.’
(ﬁve-point scale, labelled 1=‘I am very
inexperienced’ to 5=‘I am very
experienced’)
‘I know a lot about investing money.’
(ﬁve-point scale, labelled from 1=‘I
fully agree’ to 5=‘I fully disagree’)
‘I am very experienced in investing
money’
(ﬁve-point scale, labelled from 1=‘I
fully agree’ to 5=‘I fully disagree’)

The four items loaded on one factor that
was called ‘investor’s competence’. Factor
scores were calculated and competence
ranks were constructed. One group was
formed for uninformed participants, one
for informed participants. Participants’
competence was treated as a separate
experimental factor in the factorial design.
For better interpretation, the sum of the
risk scores was also calculated.

‘DWS Investments (alternatively:
Fidelity Investments) is a very

‘DWS Investments stands for
competence and experience.’
‘DWS Investments stands for superior
performance.’
‘DWS Investments stands for safety.’
‘DWS Investments ﬁts my life
concept.’
‘DWS Investments is special.’
‘DWS Investments is prestigious.’

As Cronbach’s alpha was high (0.91) items
were summed to form a brand image score.
