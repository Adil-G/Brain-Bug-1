Abstract
This study examines the trust repair implications of apologizing with an internal vs. external attribution after a competence- vs.
integrity-based trust violation. By considering theory regarding diVerences in the perceived diagnosticity of information about competence vs. integrity, we note that the conditions where external attributions would be more necessary for mitigating one’s blame are
precisely the conditions where such external attributions are less likely to be believed. Moreover, empirical studies that have compared the relative beneWts of external and internal attributions for repairing trust have reached conXicting conclusions regarding the
response that should be used. We asked 189 college students to respond to videotaped scenarios in which they were asked to play the
role of a manager and make decisions about hiring an accountant who had misWled a tax return with a prior employer. Each participant was presented with one of four scenarios, which diVered with respect to the type of violation (competence vs. integrity) and type
of response (apology-internal vs. apology-external). The results revealed a signiWcant interaction whereby trust was repaired more
successfully when mistrusted parties apologized with an internal, rather than external, attribution when the trust violation concerned
matters of competence, but apologized with an external, rather than internal, attribution when the trust violation concerned matters
of integrity. These Wndings suggest that being guilty of an integrity-based violation can be so detrimental for trust that any mitigating
response, even one that perceivers are likely to question, may prove worthwhile.

Of all the diYculties that have plagued organizational
life, perhaps the most conspicuous in recent years has
been the violation of trust. Trust, which we deWne as a
psychological state comprising the intention to accept
vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the
intentions or behavior of another (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt,
& Camerer, 1998), has been found to oVer numerous beneWts for individuals, groups, and organizations (see Dirks
& Ferrin, 2002; Kramer, 1999, for meta-analytic and

narrative reviews). However, researchers have observed
that, due to numerous transgressions (only a small minority of which have received media attention), managers
have experienced signiWcant declines in trustworthiness
in the eyes of their employees and members of other
organizations (Tyler & Kramer, 1996).
The apparent frequency with which trust has been
violated, in turn, underscores a need for its repair (i.e., to
make trust more positive after a violation is perceived to
have occurred). However, researchers have identiWed at
least two reasons why the process of repairing trust may
be more diYcult, and require diVerent strategies, than
building trust initially (see Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, &
Dirks, 2004, for a review). First, given that a violation
causes trust to plunge below its initial level, one of the
challenges of trust repair is that the magnitude of the
required increase to reestablish trust is greater than what
was required to establish trust initially. Second, to repair
trust successfully, the mistrusted party must not only
reestablish positive expectations, but also overcome the
salient negative expectations that are likely to have
arisen from the trust violation. These considerations
reveal that the trust repair process can diVer both quantitatively and qualitatively from initial trust development. As a result, diVerent theoretical and empirical
approaches may be needed to understand how it occurs.
Despite these considerations, surprisingly few studies
have directly examined how trust may be repaired.
Moreover, the few studies that do exist have typically
been limited in at least one signiWcant way. Virtually all
of these studies have examined the trust repair process
by assessing the eVects of an apology. However, notwithstanding some minor diVerences in language, these apologies have typically been conveyed in a manner that
involved an internal attribution (e.g., Ohbuchi, Kameda,
& Agarie, 1989; Sigal, Hsu, Foodim, & Betman, 1988). In
other words, these apologies not only conveyed regret,
but also assumed full responsibility for the violation in
question. And though there may be many cases in which
a mistrusted party is entirely to blame, a substantial
body of research has shown that this responsibility is not
always so clear. SpeciWcally, evidence suggests that there
are numerous ways in which our behavior can, at least in
part, be externally induced due to the inXuence of the situation (see Ross & Nisbett, 1991, for a review). Consider
an accountant, for example, who has misWled a tax
return. It is certainly possible that this person is entirely
at fault for the act. However, it is also possible that this
transgression may be at least partly explained by pressure from a client, bad advice from coworkers, or various other situational inducements.
Despite these possibilities, it remains unclear whether
identifying such external inducements as part of an apology would help or hinder trust repair eVorts, and if so,
under what conditions such eVects are likely to occur. Are
the potentially disadvantageous eVects of acknowledging

one’s guilt through an apology reduced by mentioning
such mitigating circumstances, or would eVorts to mitigate
blame in this way exacerbate mistrust by making the apology seem less sincere? Moreover, can we identify any contingencies that might determine whether one of these
eVects or the other would arise? With regard to these
questions, the schematic model of dispositional attribution (Reeder & Brewer, 1979), in which we primarily
ground this research, oVers the basis for completely
opposing predictions. Our paper seeks to address these
issues by examining the implications of apologizing with
an internal vs. external attribution for repairing trust after
a competence- vs. integrity-based trust violation.
In this study, we focus on cases in which parties have
had limited prior interaction and/or the relationship is in
the emergent stages, as opposed to a relationship with a
long history. Thus, our inquiry may not capture the full
range of considerations that may pertain to trust repair in
more closely knit relationships (e.g., the role of perceived
benevolence). We, nevertheless, focus on such early interactions due to their importance for deWning the nature and
quality of the future relationship, and because the kinds of
mechanisms currently under investigation are likely to
play at least some role in longer-term relations as well.
The nature of apology
Research has shown that that the eVects of an apology
for repairing trust are not necessarily beneWcial. Although
some have observed that trust may be repaired more successfully if mistrusted parties identify, acknowledge, and
assume some “ownership” for the trust-destroying events
that occurred (Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, & Murnighan,
2002; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Ohbuchi et al., 1989), others have discerned that an apology may fail to ameliorate
the negative consequences of a trust violation because it
involves an acknowledgement of guilt (Riordan, Marlin,
& Kellogg, 1983; Schlenker, 1980; Sigal et al., 1988). Thus,
we can observe that an apology, which we deWne as a
statement that acknowledges responsibility and regret for
a trust violation,1 may exert conXicting eVects with respect
to trust repair eVorts. Whereas an apology expresses
1
The Oxford English Dictionary deWnes apology as “a regretful acknowledgement of an oVence or failure.” This deWnition speciWes only
that the failure or oVence has been acknowledged; it does not specify
that the failure or oVence must be fully acknowledged, nor does it rule
out the possibility of partial acknowledgement, or that an acknowledgement may apportion responsibility between the self and external factors.
Thus, consistent with this deWnition and the aforementioned literature,
our deWnition of apology is not restricted to cases in which one claims
to have been “entirely” at fault. It may be possible that the acknowledgement of greater responsibility with an internal vs. external attribution may make one seem more “apologetic” in perceptual terms, but
such an inXuence would at best explain a main eVect for an internal vs.
external attribution, not the violation-type £ violation-response interaction predicted by this study. We can, furthermore, observe that even this
potential main eVect failed to receive empirical support in the Results.

regret, which alone should repair trust by signaling an
intention to avoid such violations in the future, its concomitant conWrmation of guilt should lower trust by making clear that the mistrusted party was to blame. This
recognition, in turn, highlights the importance of examining whether these signals might diVer in their relative
eVects on trust and of identifying the conditions under
which such diVerences might arise.
Kim et al. (2004) began to address these issues by
investigating whether the beneWts of an apology for
repairing trust would depend on whether the trust violation is attributed to matters of competence or integrity.
These attributions are particularly relevant for studies of
trust repair because competence and integrity have been
found to represent two of the most important factors of
trustworthiness (Barber, 1983; Butler & Cantrell, 1984;
Cook & Wall, 1980; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995;
Schindler & Thomas, 1993). Expectations of “technically
competent role performance” and expectations of “the
persistence and fulWllment of the natural and moral
social orders” have been observed to “involve some of
the fundamental meanings of trust” (Barber, 1983, p. 9),
and this notion has been substantiated by ample empirical evidence (e.g., Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Schindler &
Thomas, 1993). Moreover, research has shown that these
expectations oVer important bases upon which individuals evaluate a variety of targets, including leaders
(Pancer, Brown, & Barr, 1999), job candidates (Cook &
Elmer, 1999), and potential collaborators (Kee & Knox,
1970). Competence is deWned as the degree to which one
possesses the technical and interpersonal skills required
for a job (Butler & Cantrell, 1984). Integrity is deWned as
the degree to which one adheres to a set of principles
that is considered acceptable (Mayer et al., 1995).
Kim et al. (2004) based their inquiry on a schematic
model of dispositional attribution, which suggests that
there may be some inherent diVerences in the way people
assess positive vs. negative information about competence vs. integrity (Reeder & Brewer, 1979). In particular,
this schematic model and highly supportive evidence
from numerous laboratory studies and some Weld
research indicates that although individuals tend to
weigh positive information about competence more
heavily than negative information about competence,
they tend to weigh negative information about integrity
more heavily than positive information about integrity
(e.g., Kim, Diekmann, & Tenbrunsel, 2003; Madon, Jussim, & Eccles, 1997; Martijn, Spears, Van der Plight, &
Jakobs, 1992; Reeder, Hesson-McInnis, Krohse, & Scialabba, 2001; see Snyder & Stukas, 1999, for a review).
According to this model, people intuitively believe that
those with high competence are capable of exhibiting
many levels of performance, depending on their motivation and task demands, whereas those with low competence can only perform at levels that are commensurate
with or lower than their competence level. As a result, a

51

single success is typically considered to oVer a reliable signal of competence, given the belief that those who are
incompetent would not have been able to achieve that
performance level. However, a single failure is generally
discounted as a signal of incompetence, given that those
who are competent or incompetent can each perform
poorly in certain situations (e.g., when there is inadequate
motivation or opportunity to perform well).
Along similar lines, this model contends that people
intuitively believe that those with high integrity would
refrain from dishonest behavior regardless of the situation, whereas those with low integrity may exhibit either
dishonest or honest behaviors depending on their speciWc incentives and opportunities. As a result, a single
honest act is typically discounted as a signal of honesty,
given that those who are honest or dishonest can each
behave honestly in certain situations (e.g., when there are
beneWts for behaving honestly or suYcient surveillance
to prevent dishonest acts). However, a single dishonest
act is generally considered to oVer a reliable signal of low
integrity, given the belief that only persons of low integrity would behave dishonestly.2
Kim et al. (2004) drew on these diVerences in the perceived diagnosticity of information to predict that the
relative inXuence of an apology’s signals of guilt and
redemption, and hence the beneWts of such a response
for repairing trust, would depend on whether the violation concerns matters of competence or integrity. When
the violation concerns matters of competence, the negative eVect on trust from an apology’s admission of guilt
may be outweighed by its positive eVects on trust from
signaling the intent to prevent future violations, because
people may be willing to believe that the incident was an
anomaly and that the mistrusted party would demon2
When considering these “tendencies,” we certainly recognize the
potential for exceptions. Such exceptions should not detract from the
notion that these tendencies will hold, in general, and that ample empirical support for such patterns has been found. Moreover, when considering whether a given “exception” actually exists, one should make
sure that it is weighed against its relevant comparison to avoid erroneous conclusions. One might, for example, note the possibility that positive-competence information could be less diagnostic when it is
attributed to luck, but one must then recognize that negative-competence information could also be attributed to luck (i.e., bad luck), and
also assert that attributions of luck would be more likely for positivecompetence than negative-competence information. Similarly, one
could raise the notion that someone who has found a large sum of
money and goes to great lengths to Wnd its rightful owner, for example,
would be providing positive-integrity information that is highly diagnostic. The important theoretical issue, however, is the relative diagnosticity of positive vs. negative information. Thus, in this example
involving the large sum of money, the relevant comparison would be if
that person had also gone to great lengths to steal a large sum of money from its rightful owner. Although both behaviors may be diagnostic
to some degree, numerous studies would suggest that the latter example tends to be seen as more diagnostic than the former. Such illustrations should reveal that, although exceptions to these general
tendencies may be possible, they are by no means as ubiquitous or as
obvious as one might initially believe.

strate competence in the future (i.e., people would weigh
positive information about competence more heavily
than negative information about competence). However,
when the violation concerns matters of integrity, conWrming one’s guilt with an apology should oVer a reliable signal that one lacks integrity that would outweigh
any positive eVects on trust from the apology’s signals of
redemption, because people tend to believe that a lack of
integrity would only be exhibited by those who do not
possess it and this belief, once established, would be diYcult to disconWrm (i.e., people would weigh negative
information about integrity more heavily than positive
information about integrity). These predictions were
supported by Kim et al.’s (2004) two empirical studies.
Thus, it appears that although an acknowledgement of
guilt may generally impede trust repair eVorts (i.e., the
perception of guilt, on its own, is always detrimental and
results in lower levels of trust than what had existed initially), this eVect should be particularly pronounced after
an integrity-based trust violation.

Fig. 1. Trust repair decision tree diVerentiating the question of whether
to apologize or deny culpability for the violation from the question of
how the apology should be conveyed (i.e., by assuming more responsibility or less).

These Wndings raise a natural question. If the perception of guilt is problematic for those who wish to repair
trust, why not try to reduce it? Kim et al. (2004) explored
this option by comparing the implications of apology
with denial, which they deWned as a statement whereby
an allegation is explicitly declared to be untrue, for
repairing trust and discovered that there are cases when
denial can prove to be the more eVective response (i.e.,
after an integrity-based violation). These researchers
also noted, however, that there are many occasions in
which the mistrusted party has committed the violation
in question, and that when this is the case, it would not
only be unethical but also strategically risky to respond
with a denial (i.e., given that evidence of one’s involvement may subsequently be revealed). These constraints,
therefore, raise the question of whether one might mitigate this guilt in other ways, such as by providing an
apology, but doing so in a manner that provides an
external attribution for one’s actions.
This question of whether to apologize with an external attribution highlights a concern that fundamentally
diVers from the question examined by Kim et al. (2004).
Whereas Kim and his colleagues investigated the question of whether to oVer an apology, the present inquiry
takes the oVering of an apology as given and investigates
the question of how such apologies should be conveyed,
speciWcally whether the apology should assume more or
less responsibility for the violation (see Fig. 1). Thus, the
present work examines a later logical stage in this decision tree and pursues a more focused question than what
had been examined by Kim et al. (2004) (i.e., diVerent
types of apologies rather than both apologies and denials). However, the present question is of equal signiW-

cance to that of Kim et al. (2004), since a failure to use
the appropriate form of apology is just as likely to
impede a trust repair eVort as a failure to appropriately
select between apology and denial.
Research has oVered compelling support for the
notion that our behavior can be inXuenced by the situation. Situational factors such as ambiguity, pressure
from authority, and exposure to the views of others, for
example, can lead individuals, respectively, to ignore the
needs of others, terrorize those under our inXuence, and
even alter our most basic assessments of what is right
and wrong (e.g., Blanchard, Crandall, Bringham, & Vaughn, 1994; Latane & Darley, 1968; Milgram, 1974). Thus,
given that we are all susceptible to situational inXuences,
it seems reasonable to expect that attributing one’s
actions to such external inXuences would, at least to
some degree, provide a mechanism for mitigating one’s
blame (i.e., the extent to which one is considered responsible for having exceeded a normative standard in a negative direction) (Hamilton, Blumenfeld, & Kushler,
1988). Indeed, an array of studies supports this intuition.
Perceivers have been described as being concerned
with Wnding the underlying causes of human behavior
(Heider, 1958). Thus, when considering whether an
action was caused by dispositional or situational factors,
perceivers attempt to subtract out the eVect of the situation and attribute what remains to the individual
(Kelley, 1973). The logic that drives this “discounting
principle” is that dispositional and situational forces
operate in a hydraulic fashion, so that as situational
forces grow stronger, the role of the individual grows
weaker (McClure, 1998). This logic has, furthermore,

<-----Page 4----->P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65

been observed to underlie the majority of dispositional
inference models that have been provided in the literature (Gilbert, 1995, 1998).
Thus, it is with little wonder that external attributions
have generally been found to prove beneWcial for those
who have committed a wrong (e.g., Shaw, Wild, & Colquitt, 2003). Crant and Bateman (1993), for example, discovered that supervisors in a large accounting Wrm, who
read scenarios that described an unsuccessful audit,
blamed the subordinate less if an external causal account
was oVered than if it was not. Wood and Mitchell (1981)
found that nurse managers, who read scenarios depicting their subordinates erring in patient care, assigned less
responsibility, and punished less severely when they were
given accounts of external causes for the poor performance than when they were given an apology. Moreover, Weiner, Amirkhan, Folkes, and Verette (1987)
found, through a series of four empirical studies, that
external attributions can reduce anger in the victim of a
transgression and thereby reduce tension in potentially
inXammatory situations.
This prevailing view regarding the desirability of
external attributions has been tempered of late, however,
by some growing awareness of their limitations. Schlenker, Pontari, and Christopher (2001), for example, noted
that excuse makers risk being seen as deceptive, selfabsorbed, and ineVectual. Moreover, Tomlinson, Dineen, and Lewicki (2004) found that victims of a broken
promise were more willing to reconcile a professional
relationship when the violator oVered an internal rather
than an external attribution. Hodgins and Liebeskind
(2003) likewise reported that victims exhibited more positive evaluations and expectations of future relationships
when transgressors assumed greater responsibility for
the act in question rather than less. Presumably, these
eVects arise because those who assume full blame with
an internal attribution are seen as more likely to correct
these actions in the future (i.e., achieve redemption) than
those who attempt to mitigate their blame with an external attribution.
This more recent work regarding the disadvantages of
external attributions is, of course, less established than
the larger number of studies that highlight their beneWts.
Nevertheless, an awareness of such disadvantages may
allow us to move beyond the general question of whether
external attributions can be beneWcial for alleged transgressors, which by now has been well-established, to the
question of when. If one has violated trust, when would
mitigating one’s blame with an external attribution
prove more helpful or harmful to the relationship than
assuming full blame with an internal attribution (which,
presumably, would convey stronger signals of intended
redemption)? Or to put matters more simply, for those
who wish to repair trust, are there occasions when it is
better to assume more blame rather than less? With
regard to this fundamental question, it appears that the

53

existing literature provides the basis for completely
opposing predictions.
Necessity vs. acceptance as a basis for blame mitigation
One conclusion we might draw, based on the aforementioned research concerning the perceived diagnosticity of information (e.g., Kim et al., 2004), is that external
attributions should be more eVective than internal attributions for repairing trust when the need to mitigate
blame is great. SpeciWcally, the notion that people tend
to weigh negative information about integrity more
heavily than positive information about integrity suggests that, when trust violations concern matters of
integrity, mitigating one’s blame with an external attribution would be more eVective for repairing trust than
assuming full blame with an internal attribution, because
information about guilt (i.e., highly diagnostic negativeintegrity information) would be weighed more heavily
than any signals of intended redemption that an internal
attribution might convey (i.e., less diagnostic positiveintegrity information). In contrast, the notion that people tend to weigh positive information about competence more heavily than negative information about
competence suggests that, when trust violations concern
matters of competence, assuming full blame with an
internal attribution would be more eVective for repairing
trust than mitigating one’s blame with an external attribution, because the internal attribution’s signals of
intended redemption (i.e., highly diagnostic positivecompetence information) would be weighed more
heavily than information about guilt (i.e., less diagnostic
negative-competence information). Thus, based on this
logic, trust should be repaired more successfully when
mistrusted parties apologize with an external rather than
internal attribution for integrity-based trust violations,
but apologize with an internal rather than external attribution for competence-based trust violations.
Hypothesis 1a. Trust will be repaired more successfully
when mistrusted parties apologize with an external
rather than internal attribution for integrity-based trust
violations, but apologize with an internal rather than
external attribution for competence-based trust violations.
However, by revisiting the principles that underlie
these information diagnosticity diVerences, we might
observe that this outcome is not as clear-cut as the above
reasoning suggests. Recall that Reeder and Brewer
(1979) theorized that the reason individuals weigh positive information about competence more heavily than
negative information about competence is that people
intuitively believe that those with high competence are
capable of exhibiting performance at many levels,
depending on their motivation and task demands,
whereas those with low competence can only perform at

<-----Page 5----->54

P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65

levels that are commensurate with or lower than their
level of competence. Similarly, the reason individuals
weigh negative information about integrity more heavily
than positive information about integrity is that people
intuitively believe that those with high integrity would
refrain from dishonest behaviors in any situation,
whereas those with low integrity may exhibit either dishonest or honest behaviors depending on their incentives
and opportunities.
These considerations reveal a fundamental diVerence
in our willingness to attribute competence- vs. integrityrelated behavior to the situation. In particular, these
notions suggest that people may be willing to accept an
external attribution for a competence-based trust violation, given their belief that even competent individuals
can perform poorly in certain situations. However, these
notions also suggest that people are unlikely to accept an
external attribution for an integrity-based trust violation, given their belief that situational inXuences could
not cause those who possess integrity to behave dishonestly. Indeed, the latter notion led Reeder and Spores
(1983) to predict that those who behave immorally
would be judged to be immoral, regardless of whether
situational pressures appeared to facilitate this behavior,
and subsequently support this prediction with two
empirical studies.
These considerations suggest an alternative prediction regarding the relative beneWts of internal and external attributions for repairing trust, based not on when
there may be a greater need to mitigate blame, but rather
on when such mitigating eVorts are more likely to be
accepted. In particular, the notion that an external attribution would fail to mitigate blame when trust violations concern matters of integrity suggests that this
response would only make the mistrusted party’s apology seem less sincere. An internal attribution, in such
cases, would not only avoid this problem but may also
oVer stronger signals that honest behavior would be
forthcoming (i.e., to the extent that the assumption of
full blame conveys greater regret than eVorts to mitigate
one’s blame), which people may believe given their
expectation that both those with and without integrity
would be able to behave honestly if they choose. In contrast, the notion that people are willing to accept external attributions when trust violations concern matters of
competence suggests that such a response may oVer a
viable way of mitigating one’s blame for competencebased trust violations. An internal attribution, in such
cases, would not only forgo this beneWt but also conWrm
that the mistrusted party lacks competence, which may
hinder trust repair, given people’s belief that only competent individuals would be able to exhibit competent
behavior. This reasoning, therefore, provides the basis
for a competing prediction—that trust would be
repaired more successfully when mistrusted parties apologize with an internal rather than external attribution

for integrity-based trust violations, but apologize with
an external rather than internal attribution for competence-based trust violations.
Hypothesis 1b. Trust will be repaired more successfully
when mistrusted parties apologize with an internal
rather than external attribution for integrity-based trust
violations, but apologize with an external rather than
internal attribution for competence-based trust
violations.
An interesting irony that arises from these competing predictions can be found in the fact that their plausibility is each based on the same underlying theory.
The same principles that drive the aforementioned
diVerences in the perceived diagnosticity of positive vs.
negative information about competence vs. integrity
(Reeder & Brewer, 1979) indicate that the conditions
under which eVorts to mitigate one’s blame with an
external attribution are more necessary (H1a) are precisely the occasions when such eVorts are less likely to
be accepted (H1b). Thus, we would likely gain not only
practical but also important theoretical insights by
determining which of these predictions would be
upheld. Is the success of trust repair eVorts primarily
determined by considerations of necessity or acceptance? Or would these competing forces simply cancel
one another out so that no meaningful eVects are
found? This paper investigates these issues in the
empirical study described below.

Method
We designed a laboratory experiment in which participants watched a videotape of a job applicant at an
accounting Wrm, who had been accused of incorrectly
Wling a tax return in her last job, and then rated the
applicant’s trustworthiness after she explained what had
occurred. Following guidance provided by Dobbins,
Lane, and Steiner (1988), we chose this experimental
method and laboratory setting so we could draw clear
conclusions about causality. This study implemented a 2
(Violation-type: competence vs. integrity) £ 2 (Violation-response: apology-internal vs. apology-external)
between-subjects design. Participants were randomly
assigned to the four study conditions. Each participant
represented a unit of analysis.
Participants
One hundred eighty-nine undergraduate students
enrolled in introductory organizational behavior and
human resources management courses participated in
this study for course credit. Participants were 63% male,
an average of 21-years old, and possessed an average of
1 year of full-time work experience.

Setting
The speciWc setting in question concerns an employment interview of a senior-level tax accountant. Both
Kim et al. (2004) and Ferrin, Kim, Cooper, and Dirks
(2005) have empirically demonstrated that this is a setting in which (a) perceivers would exhibit initial trust in
parties with whom they have had no history of interaction and (b) allegations of untrustworthy behavior
would create suspicion suYcient to violate this trust.
Indeed, the detrimental eVect of such allegations on perceivers’ trust levels was found in each of these studies to
be both dramatic and comprehensive.3 This evidence,
therefore, provides clear and consistent support for the
suitability of this context for investigating trust repair.
Task
Participants were given materials that asked them to
assume the role of a manager who was in charge of hiring, and subsequently managing, a senior-level tax
accountant. If hired, the candidate would be oVered a
1-year contract because it was the policy of the Wrm to
employ all Senior Tax Accountants under 1-year contracts with renewal contingent upon annual performance evaluations. Participants were told that, to
expedite the hiring process, a recruiter from the Wrm had
already interviewed the applicants and that these interviews had been videotaped and transcribed so participants could quickly and conveniently assess the
applicant pool. Participants were then given the transcript for one of these interviews and shown the accompanying video clip so they could provide their own
evaluation of the applicant. After watching the interview, participants completed a questionnaire.
Manipulations
Four versions of this interview were Wlmed in a private oYce with a video crew and actors in accordance
with our 2 £ 2 experimental design. The bulk of each version contained identical video footage (brief introductions, some minor small talk, a request to videotape the

Kim et al. (2004), for example, found that participant assessments
of the candidate’s competence (M D 5.64 vs. M D 2.68) (t (34) D 14.21,

interview, and a discussion of the candidate’s interest in
the Wrm and job qualiWcations); only the segments containing the two manipulations diVered across study conditions. Near the end of the approximately 10-min long
interview, the recruiter disclosed to the job applicant
that she had contacted some of the applicant’s references
from the previous employer and that these references
informed the recruiter that the applicant had been
involved with an accounting-related violation in her previous job. The framing of, and response to, this trust violation represented the study manipulations.
Violation-type
The trust violation was framed as either a competence- or integrity-related matter. The violation was
described so that it was consistent with the conceptual
deWnitions of competence and integrity presented earlier
in the article. In both conditions, the job applicant was
accused of Wling an incorrect tax return that understated
a client’s capital gains income. In the competence condition, the job applicant was accused of Wling the incorrect
return due to inadequate knowledge of the relevant tax
codes. SpeciWcally, the recruiter in the video recounted a
conversation with co-workers from the applicant’s previous Wrm who were called as references: “..they said that
you had been asked to resign as a result of incorrectly
preparing a tax return for one of your former Wrm’s
wealthier clients. In fact, they said it was because you
had inadequate knowledge of relevant tax codes.” In the
integrity condition, the job applicant was accused of
Wling the incorrect return intentionally: “ƒthey said that
you had been asked to resign as a result of incorrectly
preparing a tax return for one of your former Wrm’s
wealthier clients. In fact, they said you intentionally
underreported your client’s capital gains earnings.” In
both cases, the information was hearsay. The recruiter
did not have evidence of the candidate’s guilt or innocence.
Violation-response
Immediately after the trust violation was mentioned,
the job candidate responded to the allegation by apologizing in a manner that provided either an internal or
external attribution for the act in question. In the apology-internal attribution condition, the candidate
assumed full responsibility for the trust violation. In the
apology-external attribution condition, the candidate
assumed only partial responsibility for the trust violation and attributed the rest of this responsibility to the
inXuence of higher level managers (i.e., either bad advice
regarding the implementation of tax codes or pressure to
misreport some of the return’s numbers, respectively, in
the competence and integrity conditions). In both cases,
the candidate also stated that such an incident would not
happen again and that the Wrm would not have to worry
about her committing such an infraction if she were

hired. Please refer to the Appendix A for exact quotes of
the response to the violation for each condition.4
Manipulation checks
Participants responded to three manipulation check
questions, which were designed to assess whether participants recognized the categorically diVerent experimental
conditions to which they were assigned. The Wrst two
assessed whether they recognized the nature of the violation (i.e., whether it concerned matters of competence vs.
integrity). SpeciWcally, respondents were Wrst asked, “In
the video, Ballou was accused of incorrectly preparing a
tax return. What was the accusation?” Options were
“inadequate knowledge of tax codes,” “intentionally
underreported a client’s capital gain,” and “neither of
the above.” They were then asked, “What does this accusation bring into question?” Options were “primarily
4
The candidate’s violation-response in each of the “partial responsibility” conditions includes the statement “I was partly guilty in preparing an incorrect tax return.” To address potential concerns that this
suggestion of being “partly guilty” entails a partial denial of having
committed the act rather than a claim of partial responsibility (i.e., an
external attribution), one should note the following. First, according to
both the Oxford English Dictionary and Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, the term “guilty” is deWned as being “responsible for a speciWed
wrongdoing, fault, or error” and thus concerns whether one is blameworthy for an act (i.e., responsible), rather than whether the person
committed the act itself. Second, our use of the term “guilt” as an indicator of responsibility is consistent with popular references to guilt
(e.g., “not guilty by reason of insanity”) that clearly disentangle the
question of responsibility from whether one has committed the infraction. Third, even if there was any lingering ambiguity regarding whether the term “partly guilty” was indicating partial responsibility vs. a
partial denial, such ambiguity would be resolved by the subsequent
statements in the manipulation, which explain exactly what this person
means by that phrase (i.e., whether there were external inducements for
this action, and not the extent to which she actually committed the
transgression). Finally, given that the violation in question concerns
the misWling of a tax return, it does not make sense to partly deny this
act, since misWling any part of the return means that the return has
been misWled (i.e., the return can either be misWled or not and, hence,
must be seen in binary terms). Thus, there are formal, intuitive, expository, and logical reasons, respectively, for rejecting the notion that the
claim of being “partly guilty” entails a “partial denial.” To verify this
reasoning, we conducted a small study with a separate set of twenty
undergraduates from the same population as those in the main experiment. These participants were presented with a transcript of either of
the two “external attribution” manipulations shown in the Appendix
A (i.e., with 10 reading the competence violation, and the other 10
reading the integrity violation) and asked “In the statement above,
what was the job candidate trying to claim?” Options were “The job
candidate was only partly responsible for misWling the tax return because others facilitated this misWling through bad advice or pressure,”
“The job candidate only partly misWled (or misWled only a part of) the
return,” and “Neither of the above.” Results revealed that all twenty
participants chose the Wrst option (i.e., “The job candidate was only
partly responsible for misWling the tax return because others facilitated
this misWling through bad advice or pressure”). This provides clear
support for the notion that the phrase “partly guilty” was being interpreted as a claim of being partly responsible, rather than as a partial
denial of having committed the act itself.

Ballou’s technical ability (i.e., knowledge of tax codes),”
“primarily Ballou’s integrity (i.e., willingness to bend the
rules),” and “neither of the above.” The third question
assessed whether respondents recognized the response to
the violation (apology-internal vs. apology-external).
They were asked “What was Ballou’s response to the
accusation?” Options were “admitted to Wling an incorrect return and admitted personal responsibility for the
problem,” “admitted to Wling an incorrect return but
stated that other parties helped create the problem,”
“denied the accusation completely,” and “did not admit
to or deny the allegation.” After answering the three
manipulation check questions, participants responded to
a number of dependent measures.
Dependent measures
Following McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany
(1998), we diVerentiate trust into “trusting intentions”
(i.e., a willingness to make oneself vulnerable to another
in the presence of risk) and “trusting beliefs” (e.g., the
beliefs about another’s integrity or competence that may
lead to trusting intentions). Thus, we recognize that trust
is a fairly complex, multifaceted construct, and we presume that trust repair eVorts will usually need to focus
on trusting beliefs as well as trusting intentions.5 Accordingly, we deWne trust repair eVorts as activities directed
at making a trustor’s trusting beliefs and trusting intentions more positive after a violation is perceived to have
occurred.
Several measures were, therefore, developed to test
the study predictions. Separate multi-item scales were
adapted to assess the two trusting beliefs that were of
interest in this study (i.e., perceived competence and perceived integrity). Additionally, two separate measures
were used to assess participants’ trusting intentions
toward the candidate. We used a version of Mayer and
Davis’s (1999) “willingness to risk” scale to obtain a general assessment of trusting intentions, and we assessed
participants’ intention to hire the candidate to capture
their willingness to make themselves vulnerable to the
accused party in a manner that would be more relevant
to this speciWc context. The s for these measures are
provided in Table 1.
Perceived competence
Three items were adapted from Mayer and Davis
(1999) to assess perceptions of the job applicant’s competence. Since the Mayer and Davis (1999) items were
designed to assess the perceived competence of top management, we altered the items slightly to increase their
5
Mayer et al. (1995) refer to perceived competence and perceived integrity as “factors of perceived trustworthiness.” Additionally, given
that the intention to hire and willingness to risk measures used in the
present study assess participants’ intentions, rather than actual behaviors, Mayer et al. would consider each to be a measure of “trust.”

relevance for the present study. The resulting items were
the following: (1) Ballou is very capable of performing
her job, (2) Ballou has much knowledge about the work
that needs to be done on the job, and (3) I feel very conWdent in Ballou’s skills. Respondents rated these items on
a 7-point Likert scale (1 D strongly agree; 7 D strongly
disagree).
Perceived integrity
Similar to the competence scale, three items were used
to assess perceptions of the job applicant’s integrity. This
scale was also based on the integrity scale used by Mayer
and Davis (1999), but altered to be more relevant to the
present study. Respondents were asked to rate the following items: (1) I like Ballou’s values, (2) Sound principles seem to guide Ballou’s behavior, and (3) Ballou has
a great deal of integrity, using a 7-point Likert scale
(1 D strongly agree; 7 D strongly disagree).
Willingness to risk
Three items were used to measure how much the participants, in their role as manager, were willing to put
themselves at risk to the candidate: (1) I would not let
Ballou have any inXuence over issues that are important
to me, (2) I would keep an eye on Ballou, and (3) I would
give Ballou a task or problem that was critical to me,
even if I could not monitor her actions (reverse-scored).
Respondents rated these items on a 7-point Likert scale
(1 D strongly agree; 7 D strongly disagree). This scale was
also adapted from a trust scale used by Mayer and Davis
(1999).
Hiring
Participants were asked to rate the likelihood that
they would hire the job applicant on a 7-point Likert
scale with anchors of “deWnitely” and “deWnitely not.”
This item was reverse-scored. This measure should be
interpreted as a proxy for trusting intentions toward the
candidate, as it is essentially a way of assessing whether
respondents were willing to put themselves at risk to the
candidate (as opposed to interpreting it as an actual hiring decision). The single item measure may create some

57

concern regarding reliability, but the speciWcity of the
issue in question provides grounds for allaying this concern (Sackett & Larson, 1990).

Results
Manipulation checks, descriptive statistics, and
convergent and discriminant validity
Manipulation checks revealed that the manipulations
were successful. Of the 189 participants, 165 answered all
three questions correctly (87.3%), 16 (8.5%) missed one
question, and 8 (4.2%) missed two questions. We
included subjects who answered all questions correctly,
since this indicated they fully understood both the violation-type and response-type manipulations contained in
the video. Thus, the Wnal sample size was 165.
ConWrmatory factor analyses of the trusting beliefs
and trusting intentions variables (perceived Competence,
perceived Integrity, Willingness to Risk, and Hiring)
indicated a good Wt and supported convergent validity
for a four-factor model, X2 (30, N D 165) D 64.68,
CFI D .99, NFI D .99, TLI D .99, RMSEA D .084, all
item-factor loadings >|.48| (p < .001). Discriminant analyses (Bagozzi & Phillips, 1982) indicated that the
hypothesized four-factor model Wt the data signiWcantly
better than any of the more parsimonious models, supporting the discriminant validity of the constructs. SpeciWcally, the best Wtting three-factor model, in which the
correlation between Willingness to Risk and Hiring was
set at 1.0, had X2 (31, N D 165) D 76.03, CFI D .99,
NFI D .98, TLI D .98, RMSEA D .094, X2 (1, N D 165) D

perceptions of competence were lower when the trust
violation concerned matters of competence (M D 4.94)

rather than integrity (M D 5.90), and perceptions of
Integrity were lower when the trust violation concerned
matters of integrity (M D 3.82) rather than competence
(M D 5.06). These results provide further support for the
eVectiveness of the study’s violation-type manipulation
(i.e., competence vs. integrity).
We interpreted the signiWcance and pattern of the violation-type £ violation-response interaction to test competing Hypotheses 1a and 1b. Recall that Hypothesis 1a
predicted that trust would be repaired more successfully
when mistrusted parties apologize with an external
rather than internal attribution for integrity-based violations, but apologize with an internal rather than external
attribution for competence-based violations. Hypothesis 1b, in contrast, predicted that these patterns would be
reversed (i.e., that trust would be repaired more successfully when mistrusted parties apologize with an internal
rather than external attribution for integrity-based violations, but apologize with an external rather than internal attribution for competence-based violations).
The MANOVA revealed that the violationtype £ violation-response interaction was signiWcant,

Wilks’ Lambda D .93, F (4, 158) D 2.82, p < .05; 2 D .067.
Additionally, follow-up univariate analyses of the four
dependent variables indicate that the interaction was signiWcant for perceived Integrity, F (1, 161) D 6.23, p < .05;
2 D .037, Willingness to Risk, F (1, 161) D 4.82, p < .05;

but not perceived competence, F (1, 161) D 0.33, ns;
2 D .002. The signiWcant interactions are illustrated in
Fig. 2. These Wndings provide clear and consistent support for Hypothesis 1a over Hypothesis 1b.
We conducted post hoc comparisons to explore these
patterns of means. As may be seen in Fig. 2, when the
trust violation concerned matters of competence, perceived Integrity was higher when the apology conveyed
an internal rather than external attribution (MINT D 5.43
vs. MEXT D 4.68) and this diVerence was signiWcant,
F (1, 79) D 6.80, p < .05; 2 D .079. When the trust violation concerned matters of integrity, perceived Integrity

MINT D 3.71), but this diVerence was not signiWcant,

Similar patterns were found for Willingness to Risk
and Hiring, although the diVerences between apologizing with an internal vs. external attribution were signiWcant for integrity- rather than competence-based
violations. When the trust violation concerned matters
of competence, Willingness to Risk was higher when the
apology conveyed an internal rather than external attribution (MINT D 3.55 vs. MEXT D 3.37), but this diVerence
was not signiWcant, F (1, 79) D 0.79, ns; 2 D .010. When
the trust violation concerned matters of integrity, Willingness to Risk was higher when the apology conveyed
an external rather than internal attribution (MEXT D 3.69
vs. MINT D 3.29), and this diVerence was signiWcant
F (1, 82) D 5.46, p < .05; 2 D .062. Finally, when the trust
violation concerned matters of competence, the likelihood of Hiring was higher when the apology conveyed
an internal rather than external attribution (MINT D 4.88
vs. MEXT D 4.41), but the diVerence was not signiWcant,
F (1, 79) D 2.36, ns; 2 D .029. When the trust violation
concerned matters of integrity, the likelihood of Hiring
was higher when the apology conveyed an external
rather than internal attribution (MEXT D 5.02 vs.
MINT D 4.44), and this diVerence was signiWcant,
F (1, 82) D 5.05, p < .05; 2 D .058.
Thus, we can observe that although the speciWc type
of violation for which signiWcant diVerences were found
varied across these dependent measures, the basic pattern of means was always the same. The results from this
study reveal that trust was repaired more successfully
when the mistrusted party apologized with an external
rather than internal attribution when the trust violation
concerned matters of integrity, but apologized with an
internal rather than external attribution when the trust
violation concerned matters of competence.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate the implications of apologizing with an internal vs. external attribution for trust repair after a competence- vs. integritybased trust violation. Although situational inXuences are
widely acknowledged to aVect behavior, few studies have
investigated the conditions under which identifying such
inXuences would help repair trust after its violation.
Moreover, with regard to this fundamental question, it
appears that the same theoretical foundations can provide the basis for completely opposing predictions.
Our study reveals that trust was repaired more successfully when the mistrusted party apologized with an
internal attribution when the violation concerned matters of competence, but apologized with an external
attribution when the violation concerned matters of
integrity. The dependent measures as a whole as well as
univariate tests of perceived integrity, intention to hire,
and willingness to risk provided clear and consistent

59

support for this pattern of eVects. Thus, we can observe
that, irrespective of whether the situation can explain
one’s untrustworthy behavior, there are occasions when
it is better to assume more blame (i.e., by omitting such
situational explanations) and occasions when it is better
to assume less (i.e., by making such external inXuences
known).
Implications for research on trust repair
These Wndings contribute to a small but growing
body of research that examines how trust might be
repaired in the aftermath of a trust violation. Although
prior investigations in this arena have reached conXicting conclusions regarding the beneWts of an apology for
repairing trust, recent studies have found that the beneWts of an apology relative to alternative responses, such
as denial, can depend on the type of trust violation and
the availability of evidence concerning innocence or guilt
(Kim et al., 2004). The present study further extends
these insights by revealing that, even when an apology
may be warranted, another critical choice must be made.
SpeciWcally, this investigation explores the notion that
an apology can be oVered with either an internal or
external attribution and Wnds that the implications of
this choice also depend on the type of trust violation.
Although very few studies have compared the implications of internal and external attributions for subsequent appraisals of trustworthiness, the ones that exist
have reached contradictory conclusions. Crant and Bateman (1993), for example, found that external attributions diminished observer’s assignments of blame for
failure. However, Tomlinson et al. (2004) found an
entirely diVerent result—that victims of a broken promise were more willing to reconcile a professional relationship when the violator oVered an internal, rather than
external, attribution. Thus, similar to how Kim et al.
(2004) reconciled an underlying debate regarding the relative beneWts of apology and denial, the present study
allows us to move beyond these more universalistic
debates regarding whether internal vs. external attributions should be desired and focus greater attention on
how various contingencies (e.g., whether the violation
concerns matters of competence or integrity) aVect when
each of these conclusions will be upheld.
Moreover, by revealing that internal attributions
repaired trust more eVectively for competence-based violations and external attributions repaired trust more
eVectively for integrity-based violations, rather than the
reverse, these results help resolve the contradictory
implications of the same underlying theory, Reeder and
Brewer’s (1979) schematic model of dispositional attribution. SpeciWcally, given that this same theoretical
foundation indicates that the conditions under which
eVorts to mitigate one’s blame with an external attribution are more necessary are precisely the occasions when

<-----Page 11----->60

P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65

such eVorts are less likely to be accepted, the present
Wndings oVer important insight into how this discrepancy is resolved. Indeed, the results suggest that the need
to mitigate blame when trust violations concern matters
of integrity ultimately exerts a stronger inXuence on the
success of trust repair eVorts than the potential for
external attributions to be less accepted under those
conditions. Thus, it appears that being guilty of an integrity-based violation can be so detrimental for trust that
any mitigating response, even one that perceivers are
likely to question, may prove worthwhile. This Wnding
deserves particular attention given that prior empirical
research has shown how readily people dismiss situational explanations for immoral behavior (Reeder &
Spores, 1983).
Implications for research on accounts
These Wndings also oVer some implications for
research on verbal accounts. Much of the scholarly interest in accounts has been attributed to Scott and Lyman’s
(1968) taxonomy, which distinguishes between two general types of explanations: justiWcations and excuses.
Whereas justiWcations are deWned as “accounts in which
one accepts responsibility for the act in question, but
denies the pejorative quality associated with it,” excuses
are deWned as “socially approved vocabularies for mitigating or relieving responsibility when conduct is questioned” (p. 47). This taxonomy has also been reWned by
researchers who have explored the nature of justiWcations and excuses in greater detail (e.g., Schlenker, 1980;
Sitkin & Bies, 1993). Nevertheless, this framework still
exhibits two notable limitations which this research may
help inform.
First, this taxonomy largely ignores accounts that
accept full responsibility for a transgression. Although
an apology that defends the merits of one’s decision
would be considered a justiWcation, and an apology that
attempts to reduce one’s blame with an external attribution would be considered an excuse, an apology that
simply assumes full blame with an internal attribution
lacks an accompanying classiWcation. This oversight,
furthermore, seems to have biased much of the accounts
literature against exploring the potential beneWts that
apologizing with an internal attribution might aVord.
Thus, given that the results from the present study reveal
that such unmitigated apologies can sometimes repair
trust more eVectively than those that are in the form of
an excuse, the accounts literature may beneWt by broadening its taxonomy and conducting research to compare
systematically the implications of justiWcations and
excuses with those of accounts that assume full ownership for what may have occurred.
Second, even within this existing taxonomy, the category of excuses may require some conceptual elaboration. Scott and Lyman (1968) delineate excuses into four

modal forms: appeal to accidents (i.e., lack of control
over one’s environment), appeal to defeasibility (i.e., lack
of knowledge or free will), appeal to biological drives
(i.e., susceptibility to one’s genetic predispositions), and
scapegoating (i.e., attributing the transgression to the
inXuence of another). However, this delineation fails to
consider whether eVorts to attribute a transgression to
one’s lack of competence (e.g., appeal to defeasibility)
and eVorts to provide an external attribution for one’s
actions (e.g., scapegoating) would exert divergent eVects.
Given that the results from the present study indicate
that if a transgression is attributed to one’s lack of competence, trust is repaired less eVectively with an external
rather than internal attribution, the accounts literature
would likely beneWt from some additional theoretical
development to consider why the combination of such
excuses (i.e., conveying one’s lack of ability while claiming that one’s actions were the result of pressure from
others) may not work together.
Practical implications
These Wndings also highlight a number of issues that
may warrant managerial attention. First, the results help
address the growing interest by organizations in the
potential beneWts of apologies. In the healthcare industry,
for example, hospitals have begun to question their longstanding policies of denial and evasiveness in cases of
medical errors and examine whether an apology would
help reduce the incidence and consequences of malpractice lawsuits (Tanner, 2004). However, as this paper has
previously noted, the decision to apologize ultimately
raises the question of what form this apology should
take, and organizations have only begun to consider what
elements would make such a response more of an asset
than a liability (e.g., Kiger, 2004; Van Dusen & Spies,
2003). Our inquiry helps inform this issue by demonstrating that eVorts to repair trust when one has committed a
competence-based violation (e.g., a medical error) are
more successful if one apologizes in a way that assumes
full blame for this transgression (i.e., with an internal
attribution) than by apologizing in a way that tries to
mitigate this blame (i.e., with an external attribution).
At the same time, these Wndings also caution managers from expecting that such unmitigated apologies
would provide a universal solution. SpeciWcally, our
results indicate that when one has committed an integrity-based trust violation, an apology that conveys an
internal attribution repairs trust less eVectively than
eVorts to mitigate this blame, with either an external
attribution or, as Kim et al. (2004) have observed, a
denial. We do not interpret such Wndings as justiWcation
to lie about one’s culpability if one is in fact guilty, particularly since Kim et al. (2004) have demonstrated that
such lies also exert a detrimental eVect on trust. Rather,
we consider such evidence a clarion call for managers to

<-----Page 12----->P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65

do everything possible to avoid such integrity-based
trust violations from the beginning.
Third, given that evidence regarding the actual inXuence of the situation on these violations was never
revealed in our study, and such situational inXuences can
often remain a matter of speculation in organizational
life, managers may eventually face the dilemma of knowing that their violation was inXuenced by the situation
but recognizing that they would repair trust more eVectively if they did not make these situational inXuences
known (i.e., assumed full blame with an internal attribution when the violation concerned matters of competence). In such cases, managers should prepare to
confront an ironic choice between being considered less
trustworthy due to having been more honest (i.e., by
having made the appropriate situational attribution), or
being considered more trustworthy, due to having
engaged in deception (i.e., by having assumed full blame
when it wasn’t warranted).
Fourth, it is important to note that these eVects were
revealed despite the fact that the behavior underlying
these violations of trust was actually the same (i.e., an
improperly Wled tax return). The trust violation was simply framed as a competence- or integrity-related matter.
This raises the notion that many violations of trust may
be ambiguous enough to be framed in multiple ways.6
Cursory observations suggest, however, that this opportunity to frame violations diVerently typically receives
very little attention from those who seek trust repair.
The present Wndings challenge the wisdom of this oversight by highlighting the importance not only of considering, but also of inXuencing how trust violations are
framed and by revealing that such frames can be just as
important as the kind of verbal response one might provide. Of course, we do not contend that all eVorts to
frame a violation in a particular way will be successful.
But, to the extent that an accused party is able to shape
or shift the perceiver’s understanding of the nature of
the violation, our research suggests that he or she will be
able to inXuence the eVectiveness of the violation
response.
Finally, these Wndings oVer insights not only to those
who wish to repair trust, but also for those seeking to
assess the trustworthiness of others. Given the importance of trust in organizational life, one might assume
that people would be particularly careful in making such
assessments. The present Wndings suggest, however, that
even in the aftermath of an alleged trust violation, people are susceptible to attributional schemas, framing
eVects, and other heuristics that can bias their assessments about whether trust is warranted. Thus, managers
6
In support of this view, research suggests that, rather than being determined by rational evaluations of the facts and consequences surrounding an event, moral judgments may more often occur through an
intuitive process that can be swayed by the use of diVerent interpretive
metaphors (Haidt, 2001).

61

and researchers alike must begin to question why it is
that, if decisions to trust are so important, such decisions
can be made so poorly, and then begin to develop strategies to address these limitations. Along these lines, one
strategy we may consider to improve our assessments of
trustworthiness would be to become more aware of how
perceivers, themselves, have framed a trust violation as
either a competence- or integrity-related matter and consider how they would have reacted to the violation if
they had employed the alternative frame. By doing so,
perhaps we may more routinely recognize how many
trust violations involve elements of competence and
integrity, exert greater eVorts to assess their relative
inXuence, and combine these weighted assessments to
make better-informed trust decisions.
Limitations and future directions
The Wndings from this study also raise a number of
questions for subsequent research. One issue that may be
raised regarding the present methodology is that it has
focused on trust violations in newly formed, rather than
longer term, relationships. This focus should not raise
concerns regarding whether initial levels of trust existed
and had been subsequently violated, as prior studies that
have used this methodology (Ferrin et al., 2005; Kim et al.,
2004) have oVered clear evidence that initial trust levels
were dramatically lowered by allegations of untrustworthy behavior. This focus on newly formed relationships
should also not limit its relevance for managerial settings,
given that a signiWcant proportion of our business interactions are likely to occur with those whom we have formed
weak, rather than strong, ties (Granovetter, 1995). Readers also should not necessarily conclude that studying
newly formed relationships represents a weak test of trust
repair, as recent research suggests that it may actually be
easier to repair trust in long-standing relationships, due to
victims’ greater pro-relationship motivation (Finkel,
Rusbult, Kumashiro, & Hannon, 2002). Nevertheless, the
question of whether the mechanisms of trust repair that
have been examined by this study might diVer in relationships of longer duration is an important one that remains
unanswered and deserves attention in future research. It
would, furthermore, be useful to examine whether these
kinds of mechanisms might diVer in qualitatively diVerent
relational forms (e.g., between friends or family members
rather than between a potential employee and employer).
One might expect, for example, that the nature of the relationship would aVect the perceived magnitude of the trust
violation and perhaps even one’s inclination to attribute
the violation to matters of competence vs. integrity.
A second concern regarding the present methodology
may arise from this study’s testing of undergraduate participants. Prior research in this paradigm has tested both
undergraduates and graduate business students and
found that these populations respond in the same ways

<-----Page 13----->62

P.H. Kim et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 99 (2006) 49–65

to the kinds of manipulations that have been used by
this study (Kim et al., 2004). ConWdence in the external
validity of these results is also gained from the fact that
the information conveyed to participants did not require
any kind of specialized knowledge or experience (e.g., of
tax law or income tax accounting) and by recognizing
that the mechanisms under study reXect basic psychological properties that underlie the cognitions of all individuals, not simply those of college age. Nevertheless, it may
be helpful to conduct additional research that examines
more directly whether the speciWc patterns of eVects that
have been observed by this study would generalize to
middle- and senior-level managers.
Third, our conWdence in these Wndings should be cautioned to some degree by the study’s reliance on
scenarios. Although we have sought to enrich this methodological approach by Wlming actors in a situation that
was as vivid and realistic as possible, our eVorts still
exhibit some important limitations. These limitations
include the fact that participants faced few if any of the
costs that might have been associated with their appraisals and subsequent decisions, the fact that each of them
had to imagine being in the role of a manager making
these hiring decisions rather than actually playing this
role, the notion that such role playing only allows us to
assess participants’ perceptions of how their trust
“would have been repaired” as a result of these
responses rather than actual trust repair, and the fact
that participants were only given one candidate to evaluate rather than make a choice among many. For such
reasons, the present inquiry may be more suitable as an
assessment of basic judgmental processes per se, rather
than as an inquiry that would necessarily generalize to
the speciWc context we have simulated (Greenberg &
Eskew, 1993), speciWcally the domain of accounting
industry hiring decisions.
Fourth, it may be worthwhile to determine whether
the trust repair eVects of oVering external attributions
would depend on the perceived motive for the trust violation. Research has found, for example, that people
tend to infer more negative motives and attribute lower
morality to targets whose aggression was perceived as
instrumental (facilitated by a desire for personal gain),
as opposed to reactive (a response to provocation)
(Reeder, Kumar, Hesson-McInnis, & TraWmow, 2002).
And though the present study did not focus on aggression per se, one might observe that its manipulations
signaled a motive that was more reactive (i.e., either
bad information or pressure from managers) than
instrumental in nature and wonder whether the results
might have diVered if more instrumental motives had
been conveyed. Of course, it is easy to imagine why
those who wish to mitigate their blame would be
tempted to explain that their untrustworthy behavior
was in part forced by the situation (i.e., a reactive
motive), whereas the mitigating value of stating that

situational incentives made the untrustworthy behavior in eVect too good to resist (i.e., an instrumental
motive) is rather diYcult to comprehend. This rationale is what led us to develop the speciWc external attributions manipulated in this study. Nonetheless, a study
that compares the implications of reactive and instrumental motives for trust repair may prove illuminating
on theoretical, if not practical, grounds.
A Wfth concern is the question of why these results,
as well as those for Kim et al. (2004), revealed more
robust eVects for perceived integrity compared to perceived competence. Although trust researchers have
consistently found competence and integrity are among
the most important determinants of trustworthiness,
some have found that competence was more important
than integrity (Butler & Cantrell, 1984), whereas others
have found the reverse (Schindler & Thomas, 1993).
Thus, it may be useful to investigate what features of
this and Kim et al.’s (2004) studies may have driven
their unbalanced trust belief eVects. Are these more
robust Wndings for perceived integrity unique to the
domain of trust repair or the speciWc context examined
by these studies? Or do these Wndings oVer broader
implications by shifting the overall weight of evidence
to the claim that impression formation is more heavily
determined by the appraisal of morality (integrity)
than competence (Wojciszke, Bazinska, & Jaworski,
1998)?
Finally, we should note that the results contained
herein cannot attest to whether the verbal responses
oVered in this study were suYcient to completely repair
trust to pre-transgression levels. To address that question in the present study would have involved acquiring
pre-and post-violation trust measures in addition to our
post-verbal response trust measures. We did not collect
these additional measures due to some methodological
concerns, and because we believe this is a separate question that warrants its own study. However, it would be
worth considering how future research may be designed
to overcome such concerns, and ultimately address the
question of whether trust can ever be “fully repaired.”
As these issues reveal, an enormous range of theoretical and empirical questions remains to be answered.
Indeed, the importance of trust and ease with which it
can be broken stands in stark contrast to how little we
know about its repair. As such, the present eVort resolves
a small, albeit important, piece of this large and complex
puzzle. We hope, therefore, that these and related questions regarding the trust repair process receive signiWcant attention in the future.

Apology with an internal attribution (Competence violation)
“I want to go on the record with you in saying that those
accusations are true. I was guilty in preparing an incorrect tax return. It is quite a long and drawn out story, but
the situation was that there had been new tax codes
passed recently which were relevant to that client’s situation. Truth be told, I was not as knowledgeable about
the new codes as I should have been and, as a result, miscalculated the tax return. Now I’m just looking for a new
startƒƒ.And I’m glad that you brought it up, because I
want McNeale & Associates to know that although that
accusation regarding the return is true, I am truly sorry
for what occurred and will not let it happen again. And
your Wrm would have no concerns about my ability as an
accountant if I am hired.”
Apology with an internal attribution (Integrity violation)
“I want to go on the record with you in saying that those
accusations are true. I was guilty in preparing an incorrect tax return. It is quite a long and drawn out story, but
the situation was that the client was wealthy and highly
valued by our Wrm and had a very complicated return. I
tried to cut corners a little and didn’t report all of the
capital gains the client had earned. I wanted to keep the
client happy, and I didn’t think anyone would notice.
Now I’m just looking for a new startƒƒAnd I’m glad
that you brought it up, because I want McNeale & Associates to know that although that accusation regarding
the return is true, I am truly sorry for what occurred and
will not let it happen again. And your Wrm would have

would not admit that he was the reason why this happened. Now I’m just looking for a new startƒƒ.And
I’m glad that you brought it up, because I want McNeale & Associates to know that although that accusation
regarding the return is partly true, I am truly sorry for
what occurred and will not let it happen again. And
your Wrm would have no concerns about my ability as
an accountant if I am hired.”
Apology with an external attribution (Integrity violation)
“I want to go on the record with you in saying that those
accusations are partly true. I was partly guilty in preparing an incorrect tax return. It is quite a long and drawn
out story, but the situation was that the client was
wealthy and highly valued by our Wrm and had a very
complicated return. Well, after beginning my work on
the return, I started feeling a lot of pressure from some
of the higher up managers of the Wrm to fudge some of
the capital gains numbers. They said that this client was
usually very generous with the Wrm when we helped him
out so to say. So, I tried to cut corners a little and didn’t
report all of the capital gains the client had earned.
I wouldn’t have committed the violation had I not been
pressured. But, of course, when it was found out by some
of the most senior partners, I became the scapegoat.
None of the other people involved would admit that
they were the reason why this happened. Now I’m just
looking for a new startƒ.. And I’m glad that you
brought it up, because I want McNeale & Associates to
know that although that accusation regarding the return
is partly true, I am truly sorry for what occurred and will

concerns about my integrity as an accountant if I am
hired.”

sometimes deals with clients of this type and I thought
he would be knowledgeable in this area. So, I explained
to him some of the details of the return and got his
opinion as to what I should do. And the long story
short is that after I completed the return according to
his advice I was accused of putting together an incorrect return. The violation, of course, resulted from
faulty advice from this manager. I would not have committed the violation had I not been misinformed. Later,
when I confronted him about this he denied it emphatically. He said I must have misunderstood him and
