$nanciai returnsfalter. In the,fuunders, for example, moderate risk-taking is associated with increused
ROA. However, the ROA ofthese firms decreases when risk-taking becomes excessive. In similar
fashion, founders may see their jrms’ ROA flourish if this a~rr~bl~teis present to a moderate extent.
When too pronounced, the pro~~ab~li~ of the jirm may decline. The same pattern exists between
tolerance ofambiguity and growth rate in the nonfounder group. Excessive ambiguiy tolerance may
lead ro a lack of response mechanisms for dealing with environmenlaI rhange. in assessing the
leadership of e.~~ab~~shedventures, it might be prudent for bankers, invesfors, and et~trepret~eur~~
themselves to pay heed to the mix of these characteristics.

In studies of entrepreneurial
characteristics,
attributes such as the following recur with
regularity: need for achievement,
internal locus of control, moderate propensity for risk
taking, tolerance of ambiguity, and more recently, Type A behavior (Begley and Boyd 198.5;
Borland 1974; Boyd 1984; Homaday and Aboud 1971; Liles 1974; Sexton and Bowman
1978; Timmons 1978; Welsh and White 1981).
Yet these empirical studies are marked by diverse and disparate results, perhaps due
to problems in testing instruments and sample sizes (Sexton and Bowman 1983). As a
consequence,
more research is required before the salient features of the entrepreneurial
personality can be persuasively proclaimed (Hoy and Carland 1983).
Accordingly, the first purpose of this study will be to construct a psychologi~a1 profile
of small business entrepreneurs and then determine how closely this profile applies to small
business managers. Much of the existing literature uses the general population as a comparison point and thus circumvents the question we propose to address.
Previous research has aiso failed to isolate psychological
dimensions which might
differentiate successful from less successful entrepreneurs (Sexton and Bowman 1984). Are
these characteristics identical to those which distinguish entrepreneurs from managers? To
answer these questions, the present study will explore the relationship between the psychological attributes of entrepreneurs and the financial performance of their firms.
Given the diverse definitions of entrepreneurship
in the literature (Begley and Boyd,
in press), we propose a simple distinction in this study: an entrepreneur is a person who has
founded his or her own enterprise. The comparison group of nonentrepreneurs
we propose
to examine is neither the general population nor large-company
managers; rather we will
focus on chief executives who are running smaller business firms which they did not found.
An elementary distinction is often made between the founder of an enterprise and the
person who later becomes chief executive officer (Carland, et al. 1984). According to our
definition, the founder is considered an entrepreneur but the successor is not. This simple
classification avoids dependence on subjective distinctions such as strategic preference and
orientation toward innovation. In this definition, entrepreneurship
and new venture creation
(Timmons, Smollen, and Dingee 1985) are synonymous.
In the following section, we develop hypotheses on 1) the psychological profile of
founders versus successors, and 2) the relationship
between psychological
characteristics and financial performance among founders. In examining financial performance,
we
concentrate on founders since the dearth of literature on nonfounders
limits hypothesis
generation.

NEED FOR ACHIEVEMENT
Since the pioneering work of McCJelland (1961), the need to achieve (n ach) has been
associated with entrepreneurial
behavior. High achievers set challenging goals and value

<-----Page 2----->PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE

81.

feedback as a means of assessing goal accomplishment.
They compete with their own
standards of excellence and continuously seek to improve their performance.
Although a study of business students by Hull, Bosley, and Udell (1980) found that
n ach was a weak predictor of prospective entrepreneurs, most studies support the prevalence
of high n ach among practicing entrepreneurs (Sexton and Bowman 1985). For example,
Homaday and Aboud (197 1) as well as DeCarlo and Lyons (1979) found that entrepreneurs
score higher than normative groups. Both studies used the Edwards Personal Preference
Test (EPPS), which appears more reliable than the Thematic Apperception Test (Entwistle
1972).
Based on research to date, the authors propose to test this hypothesis:
Hypothesis

l(a). In a sample of small business CEOs, founders will manifest a higher
achievement orientation than nonfounders.

If the achievement drive is pronounced among founders, it should propel them toward
high performance. In studies of successful entrepreneurs,
a high achievement orientation
seems invariably present (Sexton and Bowman 1983). This finding obtains despite variance
in the measures employed. Komives (1972), for example, used Gordon’s Study of Personal
Values to assess the achievement drive of 20 successful high-technology entrepreneurs. He
found that high n ach values were characteristic of his sample. Similarly, Smith and Miner
(1984), using a new projective technique, reaffirmed the correlation between the achievement
proclivity of entrepreneurs and the growth rate of their firms.
Given the unremitting aspiration of high achievers, corporate financial performance is
an implant
indicator of goal accomplishment.
Profit and growth data are objective ways
of providing feedback (Timmons et al. 1985).
Accordingly, as a second hypothesis, the authors postulate that:
Hypothesis

l(b).

Among small business founders there will be a positive relationship
between need for achievement and corporate financial performance.

LOCUS OF CONTROL
The Locus of Control Scale measures subjects’ perceived ability to influence events in their
lives. Internal persons believe in the efficacy of their own behavior and give little credence
to “external” forces such as destiny, luck, or “powerful others.” In contrast, externals reject
the credo that personal effort is the primary determinant of outcomes. One person wields
little influence over the varied contingencies of life (Seligman 1975).
Rotter (1966) submitted that an intemai control locus was consonant with a high achievement orientation. Subsequent research has confirmed this relationship (Brockhaus 1982). The
tie is logical, since the internality of high achievers persuades them that their actions can affect
relevant outcomes. This is not, of course, tantamount to the naive belief that individuals can
ordain the final configuration of environmental events; rather internals believe that judicious
efforts can moderate external impacts (Kobasa, Maddi, and Kahn 1982).
While control disposition may be useful for distinguishing
entrepreneurs from the
general population, it is not a valid discriminator of entrepreneurs and managers (Brockhaus
and Nord 1979). Entrepreneurs seem to be characterized by internality, but so do managers.
Nevertheless, the two groups may be differentiated by degree of intemality. As an hypothesis,
the authors postulate that:

will manifest higher

<-----Page 3----->82

T.M. BEGLEY AND D.P.BOYD

Even if the total sample under study is typified by an internal locus of control, variation
among internal scores may serve as a useful predictor of corporate financial performance.
In a longitudinal study by Brockhaus (cited in Brockhaus 1982), owners of surviving ventures
manifested higher internality than their cohorts who had failed. Since internals are imbued
with self-confidence
and possess a penchant for action, they may be more likely to affect
the outcome of events (Brockhaus 1974; Durand and Shea 1974). Conversely, extremely
high external scores might denote a sense of detachment from one’s distinctive skills and
sentiments. In line with this reasoning, Maddi, Kobasa, and Hoover (1979) found that
external locus of control showed a positive correlation with powerlessness. This may explain
why externals often experience more job alienation than internals (Mitchell 1977; Seeman
1967; Wolfe 1972).
Other studies substantiate the tie between locus of control and a variety of performance
indicators. For example, internal beliefs have been related to task orientation and academic
achievement (Lefcourt 1965). Effective groups tend to be led by internals (Anderson and
Schneider 1978). Internal small business CEOs are also more resilient in the face of environmental stressors (Anderson 1977; Anderson, Hellriegel, and Slocum 1977).
Factors besides energy and resilience may contribute to the success of internals. In a
study by Julian, Lichtman, and Ryckman (1968), internals were less likely to engage in
risky behaviors than were externals. Achievement performance might obviously be facilitated
for those selecting high-probability
outcomes. According to other studies, however, internal
executives are less conservative than their external counterparts. Since internals are sanguine
about the possibility of influencing the firm’s direction, they do not recoil from bold and
imaginative strategies. In a study of 33 business firms. Miller and Friesen (1982) found that
the more internal the top executive, the more innovative the firm.
Whatever the causal dynamic might be, an internal control disposition appears to be
associated with corporate financial performance (Anderson 1977). The authors propose to
test Brockhaus’ suggestion that “this internal belief and the associated greater effort
. hold
promise for distinguishing
successful entrepreneurs
from the unsuccessful”
(Brockhaus,
1982). Specifically. we suggest that:
Hypothesis

RISK-TAKING

2(b). Among small business founders there will be a positive relationship
between internal locus of control and corporate financial performance.

PROPENSITY

McClelland observed that entrepreneurs
exhibit moderate risk-taking propensities.
While
subsequent studies have substantiated this tendency in entrepreneurs (see Sexton and Bowman 1983, for a review), Brockhaus (1980) found that managers were similarly situated
along the risk dimension. A subsequent study suggests that risk-taking propensity may in
fact distinguish the two groups (Sexton and Bowman 1986). Since the present study will
use an instrument similar to that of Sexton and Bowman, the authors propose the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis

3(a). In a sample of small business CEOs, founders

will manifest

higher

Brockhaus (1982) suggests that risk-taking propensity has no direct bearing upon
financial performance. He renders this observation “tentatively” because his sample consisted
of new ventures. Brockhaus cautions that established entrepreneurs might be characterized
by a different risk profiie. Several writers have indicated that the process of entrepreneurship

<-----Page 4----->PSYCHOLOGICAL

CHARACTERISTICS

ASSOCIATED

WITH PERFORMANCE

83

might palliate the proclivity for risk. Timmons et al. (1985), for example, argue that risk
taking decreases as net worth accumulates. Venturesome boldness may be tempered when
there is an asset base to protect. In similar fashion, Smith and Miner (1985) note that risk
avoidance is stronger among entrepreneurs heading fast-growing firms than among those
heading slow-growth firms. Such suggestions accord with conceptual models of successful
entrepreneurs. Palmer (197 l), for instance, writes that the effective entrepreneur “can correctly interpret the risk situation and then determine policies which will minimize the risk
involved.” As entrepreneurs scan their environment,
they simultaneously
seek to exploit
opportunity and to avoid threat (Welsch and Young 1982).
Therefore, among the established entrepreneurs who typify our sample, the authors
hypothesize an inverse relationship between financial success of the firm and risk-taking
propensity of the owner. Accordingly, we submit that:
Hypothesis

3(b). Among small business founders there will be a negative relationship
between risk-taking propensity and corporate financial performance.

TOLERANCE OF AMBIGUITY
Individuals perceive ambiguity when they lack sufficient cues to structure a situation. According to Budner (1962), ambiguity may emanate from novelty, complexity. or insolubility.
Budner defines intolerance of ambiguity as the tendency to perceive ambiguous situations
as threatening; tolerance of ambiguity is the tendency to perceive such situations as desirable.
MacDonald (1970) is even less circumspect when he claims that persons with high ambiguity
tolerance deliberately seek unstructured situations. For these entrepreneurial
individuals,
goal accomplishment
is not predicated on uniformity, stability, or predictability. The focal
point is the product rather than the process (Lafond 1984).
Their internal locus may help entrepreneurs lessen dissonance and preserve equilibrium;
their robust control orientation may preclude, or at least discount, the possibility of unfavorable outcomes (Gasse 1982). Among internals lack of structure does not seem to induce
job ambivalence (Organ and Greene 1974).
Given the uncertainty inherent in the entrepreneurial environment, Schere ( 1982) called
the owner’s role “an ambiguity-bearing
role.” ScherC found that entrepreneurs displayed
more ambiguity tolerance than either top executives or middle managers. Accordingly, the
authors hypothesize that:
Hypothesis

4(a).

In a sample of small business CEOs, founders

will manifest

higher

Entrepreneurs may be energized by the diverse opportunities of a fluid environment
(Timmons et al. 1985). As Gasse (1982, p. 59) observes, entrepreneurs may view uncertainty
as “an exciting stimulus rather than a severe threat”. If ambiguity tolerance serves as a
motivational catalyst, it may foster entrepreneurial success. It has been linked, for example,
to creative behavior (Budner 1962) and to superior performance in complex tasks (MacDonald
1970). Conversely, intolerance of ambiguity has been associated with stereotypic categorization of novel stimuli (Budner 1962). The views of rigid persons are often undifferentiated
from situation to situation (Kounin 1948). Since such individuals are not prone to recast
their response repertoire, they recognize fewer possibilities for action.
While high tolerance of ambiguity does not ensure successful resolution of environmental exigencies, we nevertheless expect ambiguity tolerance to be associated with entrepreneurial success. Accordingly, we propose that:

Hypothesis

4(b).

Among small business founders there will be a positive relationship
between tolerance of ambiguity and corporate financial performance.

TYPE A BEHAVIOR
Friedman

and Rosenman

(1974) defined the Type A Behavior Pattern (TABP) as:

an action-emotion complex that can be observed in any person who is aggressively
involved in a chronic,

incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and less time,

and if required to do so, against the opposing efforts of other things or other persons.
The TABP is thus an exaggerated stylistic response to environmental challenge. Major pattern
elements include impatience and instability,
time urgency, driving ambition, acceferated
activity. and generalized competitiveness.
For small business populations,
a qualification
should be made about definitional
criteria. Prior research (Begiey and Boyd 1986) supports the assertion of Timmons et al.
(1985) that growth-minded
entrepreneurs strive to surpass their own results; they compete
with themselves more than with others. Since small business CEOs have reached the apex
of their firms, they are largely exempt from hierarchical rivalry. TABP questionnaires,
however, are oriented toward intracompany competition; small business leaders might therefore score low on this facet of the global Type A construct.
Despite modest scores on the competitive dimension, various studies have documented
the prevalence of Type A behavior among small business owner-managers (Begley and Boyd
1985, 1986; Boyd 1984). The Type A scores in all these studies are significantly above
national norms. In the most recent study, smaller firm respondents had a higher Type A
mean score than any of the 35 managerial groups from whom the national norms were
originally derived (Begley and Boyd 1986). Even after external pressures have abated, the
TABP remains an enduring characteristic of small business CEOs (Boyd and Gumpert 1983).
Studies to date, however, have focused on small business owner-managers
as a collective entity that includes but does nor isolate founders. Only one study has used the
founder-nonfounder
distinction as the basis for a TABP comparison. In that study (Boyd
and Gumpert 1983), the Type A mean of founders was higher than the Type A mean of
nonfounders. Therefore, the authors hypothesize that:
Hypothesis

5(a). In a sample of small business CEOs, founders

will manifest

more

As a result of their orientation toward achievement, Type A executives may be more
likely to achieve success than their Type B colleagues (Shekelle, Schoenberger, and Stamler
1976). Some studies support this observation (Boyd 1984; Howard, Cunningham, and Rechnitzer 1977). In a study of 236 managers from 12 different companies, Howard et al. ( 1977)
found that Type A behavior was related to recent company growth rates. Yet an opposing
argument seems equally plausible. The hyperkinetic style of Type A executives may repel
associates. Type A bosses, with their demanding expectations, often create enormous stress
for subordinates. Moreover, Type As appear to be poor time managers, often substituting
speed for deliberation. Sheer hyperactivity replaces well-monitored progress (Friedman and
Rosenman 1974).
For a smaller firm, the CEOs arousal and alacrity might eventually become dysfunctional. In a recent study (Begley and Boyd 19861, Type A behavior of small business owner-

managers associated negatively with pro~tability. 3ased on this finding, the authors propose
the folfowing hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5(b). Among small business founders there will be a negative relationship
between Type A behavior and corporate financial performance.
The hy~tbes~s on the relationships between psychological characteristics and financial
performance predict linear relationships. However, the literature hints that for at least some
of the psychological variables, the relationships may be curvilinear. For example, McClelland
( 1961) found the risk-taking propensity of successful entrepreneurs to be moderate rather
than high or low. Further, an extremely high posture on locus of control or tolerance of
ambiguity might be dysfunctjona1 for an entrepreneur. Therefore, we will test for curvilinear
~lationships.

MEASURES
Achievement motivation was measured by a subset of items taken from the EPPS. Information
on reliability and validity is reported in the EPPS manual (Edwards 1959). The manifest
needs associated with the EPPS achievement variable include: to do one’s best, to be
successful, to accomplish tasks requiring skill and effort, to accomplish something of great
significance, to do a difficult job well, and to be a recognized authority. One’s response to
these items reAects an active or passive attitude toward decision making and personal goal
setting. Our response format utilized option categories of strongly agree, agree, neither agree
nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree. The five items selected for our scale had a coef
IGent alpha of 0.672.
Locus of control was measured by the familiar Rotter scale (Rotter 1966). Considerable
research has shown this scale to be a reliable and valid index of one’s belief in the relative
efficacy of external forces (Phares 1976). In the present survey, ten items were presented
in Rotter’s forced choice format. The original wording was modified in several instances,
so external-internal attribution focused on business issues rather than general iife events.
The coefficient alpha in our study was 0.702.
Propensity for risk-taking was assessed by the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI)
(Jackson 1976). Various studies have supported the validity of the JPI as a measure of
generalized risk-taking (Jackson, Hourany, and Vidmar 1972). Acceptable internal consistencies have been reported for this ins~ment (Jackson 1977). The scale renders scores for
the relatively independent components of monetary, physical, social, and ethical risk-taking.
For purposes of the present research, the monetary risk-taking items were used, since these
best approximate the reality of business situations, Eight items were selected. As with the
EPPS, a five-point response format of disagreement/agreement was employed. The items
had a coefficient alpha of 0,784.
The conceptual theme of the scale aligns with Palmer’s de~nition of risk-taking as
“the willingness to commit to a course of action which may result in rewards or penalties
associated with success or failure” (1971:32). The high JPI scorer takes monetary chances
and enjoys adventures having an element of peril. Low scorers, on the other hand, are
unlikely to bet, even in situations where the potential gain is high. They avoid uncertain
monet~ outcomes and gravitafe toward predictable settings. Specific items are as follows:
“lf 1 invested in stocks, it would probably be in safe stocks from weIl-known companies”;
“lf the possible reward was very high, I would not hesitate puking my money in a new

<-----Page 7----->86

AND D.P. BOYD

business that could fail”; “I probably would not take the chance of borrowing money for a
business deal even if it might be profitable.”
Ambiguity tolerance was assessed by eight items from the Budner Scale of Tolerance-Intolerance
of Ambiguity (Budner 1962). The Budner Scale represents a homogeneous
dimension of self-report. The scale measures the willingness of an individual to deal with
uncertainty. Sample statements include: “A good job is one where what is to be done and
how it is to be done are always clear”; “ It is more fun to tackle a complicated problem than
to solve a simple one”; “ A person who leads an even, regular life with few surprises really
has a lot to be grateful for.” The response format paralleled that of the EPPS and the JPI.
The scale items in our study had a coefficient alpha of 0.616.
The Framin~ham Type A scale was used to measure Type A behavior (Haynes et al.
1978). Of the paper-and-pencil
measures designed to assess Type A patterns in the workplace,
this scale is recommended by the pioneer of the A/B typology (Chesney and Rosenman
1980). The Framingham scale has significantly predicted the incidence of coronary heart
disease in both sexes after 8 years of follow-up (Haynes et al. 1980). It has also been related
to self-reports of emotional lability, daily stress, tension, anxiety, and anger (Haynes et al.
1978). In the present study, 7 of the 10 scale items were used, a revision recommended by
Haynes (Chesney et al. 1981). The Framingham scale asks subjects to indicate the accuracy
of self-descriptive
statements. Sample items include: “I am pressed for time”; “I am hard
driving”; “ I get restless when 1 have to wait for something.” A five-point Likert format was
used, with response options of very often, often, sometimes, rarely and never. The greater
the agreement with the designated statements, the higher the Type A score. The coefficient
alpha in the present study was 0.723.
Two indicators of company characteristics were included in this study: company size
and company age. Size was measured by asking for the “company’s sales revenues for the
last compiled fiscal year.” Eight response options were given, ranging from “O-199,000”
to “20 million or over.” Company age was measured in years.
Three financial performance indicators were used: growth rate, return on assets (ROA),
and liquidity. Growth rate was assessed by the company’s typical yearly trends in revenues
over the past five years; the eight response options ranged from “decreased” to “increased
30% or more.” The second indicator, annual RQA over the past five years, had options
from “less than 5%” to “50% or more.” Liquidity was assessed with the following question:
“What is your company’s ratio of current assets to current liabilities?‘:
less than 1.0,
1.0-1.24, 1.25-1.49,
1.5-1.99. 2.0-2.49,
2.5-2.99,
3.0 or more.
For the financial measures, categories were used rather than open-ended responses.
This procedure was followed because 1) the convenience of categorical options may increase
respondent participation; 2) respondents might be reluctant to reveal precise financial data
that could compromise anonymity;
and 3) a sufficient number of response options can
approximate continuous measures. In an earlier survey of SBANE members, open-ended
response options to financial questions resulted in a substantial number of blank responses.
Return on assets (ROA) was used as one measure of profit. Information was also
sought on liquidity since some researchers hold that this measure is more relevant to smaller
businesses than ROA. Response categories for the financial measures were recommended
by the Small Business Administration and the Smaller Business Association of New England.

SAMPLE
The sample consists of randomly selected members of the Smaller Business Association of
New England. Questionnaires
were sent in the fall of 1985 to 730 chief executives. Re-

Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the variables included in the article. It
also lists values for some categories of ordinal-level variables. For the five psychological
variables, the means are high. Mean scores on need for achievement, locus of control, and
Type A, in particular, are located on the high side of the possible range.

“A statisticallysignificantcurvilinear effect

Three hypotheses are supported. Hypothesis I(a) postulates that founders rank higher
in need for achievement than do nonfounders.
Hypothesis 3(a) predicts that founders score
higher in risk-taking propensity. Hy~~esis
4(a) predicts that founders have higher tolerance
of ambiguity than nonfounders. Two hypotheses are rejected. Hypothesis 2(a) predicts that
founders are more internal on locus of control than nonfounders. The results show that the
two groups are similar on this dimension. Hypothesis 5(a) predicts that founders will have
higher Type A tendencies than nonfounders. No such difference emerges. Overall, founders
have higher need for achievement, risk-taking propensity, and tolerance of ambiguity than
nonfounders. The two groups do not differ in locus of control and Type A tendencies.
Hypotheses l(b), 2(b), 3(b), 4(b), and 5(b) postulate relationships between the psychological attributes of founders and the financial performance of their firms. The top half
of Table 3 presents partial correlations to assess the nature of the relationships.
Partial
correlations are used to control for the effects that company size and age might have on the
psychological variable-~nancial
performance relationship.
As the columns indicate, no
statistically significant relationships emerge for growth and ROA variables. Two attributes
associate with liquidity: locus of control and risk-taking. Risk-taking moves in the expected
direction: lower risk-taking associates with higher liquidity. Locus of control, on the other
hand, proceeds in an unpredicted direction: internality associates with lower levels of liquidity. To test the comparative contribution of the two psychological variables, the liquidity
measure was regressed on these attributes by means of a simultaneous entry procedure. In
the equation, the locus of control variable retained its statistical significance while the risktaking variable did not. In summary, the “b” hypotheses are largely disconfirmed.
For comparative purposes, partial correlations were computed between the psychologicai attributes of nonfounders and the financial performance of their companies. This
procedure tests whether the hypothesized relationships between psychological attributes and
financial success might be more characteristic of small business managers than entrepreneurs.
The bottom half of Table 3 presents the results. Again, no significant associations appear
for growth. Tolerance of ambiguity associates with ROA. Need for achievement associates

WITH PERFORMANCE

with liquidity.
These findings for nonfounders provide scant support for any relationship
between psychological attributes and financial performance.
As noted in the hypothesis section, the dearth of expected relationships could result
from curvilinearity in the data. Examination of residuals in the relevant regression equations
showed evidence of possible curvilinearity in some relationships. We tested for this possibility
by constructing polynomial equations (Kerlinger and Pedhauzur 1973, pp. 208-209). In
each equation, a financial performance measure was regressed on a psychological variable
and the squared value of that psychological variable. The significance of the increment in
variance explained by the squared variable was assessed with an F ratio. A statistically
significant increment indicated the presence of curvilinearity.
Results indicate two instances of cu~iIine~
effects among founders and one among
nonfounders. For founders, ROA was predicted by polynomiaIs for ask-taking and tolerance
of ambiguity. Risk-taking has a positive effect on ROA up to a point. Beyond that point,
increases in risk-taking begin to exert a negative effect on ROA. Similarly, tolerance of
ambiguity is positive for ROA up to a point and negative beyond it. For nonfounders,
tolerance of ambiguity positively affects growth to a certain level and then negatively affects
it. These instances of curvilinearity are indicated by an “a” in Table 3.
Is it possible that psychological
attributes might associate with company size and
experience rather than with financial performance? If so, earlier studies of entrepreneurial
success may have confounded the effects of psychological and nonpsychological
variables.
Faster growing companies might have also been the largest ones, and the most profitable
companies might also have been the oldest ones (in samples with limited ranges for both
variables). To test this possibility,
we correlated psychoIogica1 attributes with size and
experience. The results are presented in Table 4. Among nonfounders,
size and age have
little relationship with psychological attributes. Among founders, however, several associations appear. Internal locus of control and higher risk-taking propensity associate with size.
Internal locus of control, intolerance of ambiguity and low Type A tendencies associate with
company age. These relationships suggest that size and experience might be more closely
connected to psychological attributes than are growth and profits.

DISCUSSION
The article’s two main objectives were to test for differences between entrepreneurs (founders) and small business managers (nonfounders) on psychological attributes and to examine
connections between these psychological attributes and financial performance. Results indicate that founders score higher than nonfounders in need for achievement,
risk-taking
propensity, and tolerance of ambiguity. While the two groups differ on these psychological

dimensions,
the absolute differences are not large. Results also indicate few connections
between psychological attributes and corporate performance. The chief connection for founders is between internal locus of control and low liquidity. This unexpected relationship
may indicate that internals feel in control of their asset to liability ratio, and therefore are
less concerned about building a high ratio to protect themselves.
Why is there so little relationship between psychological attributes and financial performance? A number of previous studies, reviewed in the Hypothesis section, led us to
predict relationships.
The psychological variables used are ones that recur in the literature
about entrepreneurs.
Our results run counter to these earlier studies.
Several explanations
are possible. Methodological
concerns deserve consideration.
Since results are based on a mailed questionnaire,
poorly performing firms may be underrepresented. CEOs of such firms may lack both the time and inclination to record perceived
shortcomings.
The nature of SBANE itself may have affected the results. SBANE firms
tend to be well established or at least sufficiently solvent to sustain membership in a feepaying organization.
Since our sample is comprised of relatively mature firms, the characteristics of the chief executive may not affect performance as acutely as in the formative
stages.
The nature of the questionnaire itself may generate difficulties. Need for achievement
is viewed as a deeply embedded dimension.
Controversy has arisen over the efficacy of
paper-and-pencil
measures to assess this need; some researchers prefer projective techniques.
Debate also surrounds the use of paper-and-pencil
instruments to assess the Type A behavior
pattern. Many authors claim that the original interview format is the most valid assessor
(Rosenman 1978). Moreover, our shortened and amended versions of standard scales may
introduce distortion. On the other hand, our alterations rendered the instruments more relevant
to business situations. Focused modifications of this nature might reduce the distortion in
earlier versions. Finally, subject scores on the psychological attributes tend to be skewed
toward the high end of the scales. This uniform response pattern lessens the likelihood of
differential associations.
Another explanation is that the curvilinear nature of some relationships is not detected
by linear regression. Indeed, when we tested for curvilinear effects, three statistically significant curves appeared. When added to the significant linear relationships shown in Table
3, these three curves somewhat mitigate the paucity of results. In fact, these findings lead
us to wonder if many studies of entrepreneurial
characteristics might have reached different
conclusions, had they tested for curvilinear effects.
Although methodological and statistical limitations may have influenced study findings,
an alternative explanation
is that the paper accurately reflects the negligible impact of
psychological attributes on financial performance. As stated earlier, the restricted size and
age ranges of previous studies may have confounded growth with size and profits with
experience. Further, while the psychological variables included in this study are often used
to describe entrepreneurs,
various studies contest their prevalence. Even if one accepts the
widespread existence of such “entrepreneurial”
attributes, their effectiveness remains conjectural (see Brockhaus 1982; Gasse 1982, for reviews).
An intriguing possibility is that the characteristics contributing to success among the
relatively experienced entrepreneurs in this sample may differ from success factors for early
stage entrepreneurs.
For example, achievement motivation and risk-taking propensity may
be crucial for success only in the early stage companies. If this is so, it is apparent that
more is known about early stage than later stage entrepreneurship.
Among nonfounders,
too, psychological predisposition has no appreciable bearing on financial performance. Non-

founding small business managers and entrepreneurs in maturing firms constitute a considerable proportion of the small business population. Yet success factors associated with these
two groups have received almost no attention in the literature. This article indicates that
psychological features commonly linked to successful venture creation do not generalize to
success in ongoing small business management. If this observation receives further support,
the need to identify performance predictors in post-start-up stages will become compelling.
