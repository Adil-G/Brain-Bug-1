TRUSTWORTHINESS: THE ROLE OF
NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR IN THE EVOLUTION
OF COOPERATION
R. Thomas Boone and Ross Buck

ABSTRACT: Previous research has found that high emotional expressivity contributes to interpersonal attraction independently of and on par with the contributions
of physical attractiveness. Using an evolutionary perspective, we argue that emotional expressivity can act as a marker for cooperative behavior or trustworthiness.
Theoretical and empirical work from social dilemma research pointing to the advantages of having a signal for cooperation is considered, as well as research from
the limited number of studies that have looked at expressive behavior within a
social exchange context. We also argue that we need to inject nonverbal emotional
behavior into the social dilemma paradigm, which has downplayed or ignored its
role in the communication processes associated with cooperation. Finally, we offer
an outline for testing our theory and expanding the role of nonverbal emotional
processes within research on cooperation and social exchange.
KEY WORDS: cooperation; emotional expressivity; evolutionary theory; nonverbal
communication; trustworthiness.

Evolutionary theory has been successful in explaining the effect that
physical attractiveness has on interpersonal attraction. Physical attractiveness is not arbitrary; attractive people have better health outcomes and
better fertility outcomes, making them better potential mates (Langlois et
al., 2000). From an evolutionary perspective, it is adaptive for us to be
attracted to people who are marked for success. However, physical attractiveness is not the only interpersonal attribute that contributes to interpersonal attraction. Sabatelli and Rubin (1986) found that emotional expressivity is also positively related to judgments of liking, and that this effect is
independent of physical attractiveness and appears to have equal or close

to equal explanatory power in predicting ratings of interpersonal liking (see
also Riggio & Friedman, 1986). Our goal in this paper is to use evolutionary theory to explain the positive effect expressivity has on interpersonal
attraction and show the role it might play in an area of research and behavior in which it has largely been ignored.
Definitions
Expressivity
We define emotional expressivity as in Sabatelli and Rubin’s (1986)
original work, as the accuracy with which an individual displays/communicates his or her emotions. Individuals high in emotional expressivity are
good senders: that is, they clearly display their emotions, including both
positive and negative emotions. “Expressivity” or sending accuracy is distinguished from total nonverbal activity or “expressiveness” in that some
persons (i.e., psychiatric patients) can show much uncoordinated expressiveness that actually degrades communication accuracy (Buck, Goldman,
Easton, & Norelli Smith, 1998). In the present view, “expressivity” implies a
moderate level of “expressiveness” such that all else equal, receivers
watching the display have a relatively easy time accurately inferring the
sender’s emotional state.
To understand why being attracted to someone who is emotionally
expressive is adaptive, it makes sense to consider the more basic role of
emotional expression. From an evolutionary perspective, the expression of
emotion is adaptive because it facilitates social communication and social
coordination (Buck, 1984). Individuals can coordinate their actions based
upon an ongoing and reciprocal assessment of the motivational-emotional
state of the other, and it makes sense that good senders who are relatively
easy to “read” emotionally will be favored. The simple question of coordination is necessary to the more complex issue of whom to trust and
whom not to trust. Therefore, it seems likely that the expression of emotion
plays some role in the communication of trustworthiness or willingness to
be cooperative.
Trustworthiness
Trust is implicitly a dyadic concept involving a communicative relationship between a “receiver” who trusts or does not, and a “sender” who
is or is not trusted. Trustworthiness has been defined as being reliable or
worthy of fulfilling the role of having the integrity, ability, and good charac-

<-----Page 2----->165

ter assigned to you by others (Soukhanov, 1984): in the present view, this is
a quality of the sender. As receivers, we look for friends and acquaintances
in everyday life who are trustworthy so that we feel confident that our
investments are secure and our vulnerabilities will not be exploited.
Though honesty is often associated with trustworthiness, the latter is not
synonymous with honesty. We expect people whom we trust to be honest
with us, not necessarily with everyone else, and we might expect people
we trust to be willing to lie for us. Additionally, when mutual self-interests
are at stake, we may find that we are willing to trust people whom we
know to be liars. Furthermore, trustworthiness implies some degree of relationship, even of short duration, in which the person trusting has the potential to be exploited or failed by the person being trusted. Thus, when cast
within the framework of social exchange, trustworthiness can be understood as a willingness to be conditionally cooperative.1
There is little research on trustworthiness per se (Hardin, 2002). Most
research focuses on people who trust—receivers in the present view—
rather than on qualities which make persons trustworthy. In addition, investigators have seldom made the appropriate distinction between trust
and trustworthiness (Hardin, 2002). Trust is what the receiver feels toward
the sender; trustworthiness is a judged quality of the sender held by the
receiver. When this distinction is made, the adaptive value of being able to
judge a target or object’s trustworthiness becomes readily apparent. Given
the benefit of social groups and social exchange, being able accurately to
judge trustworthiness would bestow a significant advantage to any individual who possessed this skill. Indeed, recent theoretical work in game theory has suggested that being able to identify cooperative partners, partners
who are more trustworthy, may be an important, if not critical component
in the evolution of cooperation (Frank, 1988, 2001; Sally, 2000).

Background
Communication: Honest or Manipulative?
Social exchange is a critical and ubiquitous component of everyday
life; we interact in a rich social environment filled with relationships. From
working arrangements with our employers, to relationships with significant
others, to returning the grocery cart to the proper place in the supermarket,
we face a series of choices in which we choose between cooperating with
others or acting in our own short-term interests. Fortunately, and to the
surprise of some, people often choose to act cooperatively. Thus, a chal-

<-----Page 3----->166
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

lenge to the social sciences has been to explain why people make prosocial choices.
We suggest that many prosocial choices are made within a context of
trust, specifically when a person making the decision to act prosocially
feels that he or she is a trustworthy person interacting with others who are
also trustworthy. Such a model presumes trust when trustworthiness is successfully communicated. An understanding of the evolution of cooperation
requires adaptive methods of communicating trustworthiness as either a
dispositional quality (Hardin, 2002) or implicitly afforded by a given situation or social signal (McArthur & Baron, 1983).
Ethology and communication. In a discussion of the history of theories
on the evolution of communication, Hauser (1996) noted that Darwin
(1872/1998) viewed expression as having evolved to convey information
about a sender’s emotional state. Ethologists such as Lorenz and Tinbergen
largely accepted this idea and focused, among other things, on the evolutionary origins of displays. Displays were held to evolve in a process of
ritualization from potentially informative acts that reduce uncertainty, or
predict behaviors, in such a way as to influence reproductive success. The
ritualized display was seen to be designed for maximum information transfer. Having a display for trustworthiness fits readily into Darwin’s theory in
that the sender’s expression should indicate his or her willingness to be
conditionally cooperative.
The “selfish gene” and communication. Hauser (1996) noted that the
“classical” ethological position was challenged in the 1960s and 1970s by
sociobiologists and behavioral ecologists, who argued that individuals are
motivated to emphasize reproductive benefits relative to costs so as to
maximize the number of genes contributed to succeeding generations (inclusive fitness, Hamilton, 1963, 1964). This gene-centered view suggested
that selection should work against individuals whose displays are highly
informative about their actual motivational/emotional state, so that displays
will actually be designed to conceal rather than reveal the actual state of
the individual (Dawkins, 1976; Dawkins & Krebs, 1978). The result is an
evolutionary “arms race” in which the sender attempts to manipulate the
receiver and the receiver responds by “mind-reading” (Krebs & Davies,
1984, see also Sally, 2000). In effect, senders evolve progressively more
persuasive “sales pitches,” while receivers become increasingly sales resistant.
From this point of view, displays of trustworthiness, as well as broader
tendencies toward altruism, would appear to be a dead-end. If it was clear

<-----Page 4----->167
R. THOMAS BOONE, ROSS BUCK

who was willing to make individual-level sacrifices, then these individuals
would be marked for exploitation and would be less likely to survive to
pass on their genes. The theory of kin selection suggests that we may be
motivated to help people who are more closely related to us because it will
ensure genes like ours will survive, and reciprocal altruism postulates that
people will make sacrifices in hopes that others will return the favor. However, the potential for exploitation by those who “free-ride” in such situations weakens the latter theory considerably, more so if those who are
willing to sacrifice are easily identified. Further, despite all the bad news
that often catches a lot of media attention, there are many examples of
individuals willing to cooperate and make sacrifice, both big and small, for
others who are not directly related, and without an expectation of being
rewarded in return.
Evolutionary game theory and communication. In the mid-1970s, evolutionary biologists began to apply economic game theory analysis to the
problem of honest versus manipulative displays. Zahavi (1975, 1977) suggested that displays tend to be honest if and only if they are costly to the
sender: the display becomes unreliable in the absence of costs because it is
too easily mimicked. The Commitment Model offered by Frank (1988,
2001) included this logic, and furthermore argued that the emergence of
cooperative system would be greatly helped by having identifiable markers
that distinguish between individuals who are willing to cooperate and individuals who are less inclined to cooperate. Indeed, people who are less
cooperative will be more successful if it is not possible to distinguish between cooperators and defectors. From an evolutionary game-theory perspective, cooperation can only succeed with the presence of signals that
discriminate between people who are trustworthy and people who are untrustworthy. Such markers would allow cooperators to distinguish between
good partners and bad partners and to prosper without interference from
partners who would exploit them. Frank (1988, 2001) further argued that
such a signaling system is probably based upon nonverbal communication,
possibly in the form of a blush or appropriate emotional reactions embedded in facial expressions.
Empirical Findings from Social Dilemma Research
When using the evolutionary game-theory perspective, it is important
to consider the environment in which a target behavior is likely to occur.
When considering the environment created by social exchange, the most
obvious model is the research on social dilemmas, which has been used to

<-----Page 5----->168
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

model the development of cooperation for over 40 years. A good deal of
the history of empirical research in social dilemmas reflects our increasing
appreciation for the situational dynamics that underlie the emergence of
cooperation. Initial research in this area revealed that people were willing
to cooperate to some degree, but the reasons why people cooperated were
unclear. Indeed, when you consider the prisoners’ dilemma game (PD),
arguably the most well-known and commonly used social dilemma, it is
not immediately apparent how cooperation emerges.
The didactic prisoner’s dilemma. In the didactic version of the prisoner’s dilemma, familiar to anyone who watches police dramas, two prisoners are arrested for committing a minor crime, when in fact the prisoners
are thought to be guilty of committing a far more serious crime. The two
prisoners are separated and told that they have a choice: They can maintain their innocence (cooperate with their partner) or they can turn themselves and their partner in (defect on their partner). The outcome of what
will happen is jointly dependent upon the decisions of both prisoners. If
both prisoners cooperate with each other, they cannot be convicted of the
serious crime, but will have to serve 2 years each for their minor offense. If
both prisoners defect on each other, they will both be held accountable for
the serious crime and will have to serve 5 years each. However, if one
prisoner defects on his or her partner, who, in turn, cooperates by maintaining his or her innocence, then the defector gets immunity and goes free
while the cooperator serves a 10 year sentence for the serious crime. Table
1 shows the payoff matrix as a function of both prisoners’ decisions.
The problem for modeling cooperation is that logic dictates that the
dominant response to the dilemma should be defection. As shown in Table
1, if you are Prisoner B and you consider your best outcome, no matter
what Prisoner A chooses, you will be better off choosing to defect. If Prisoner A cooperates, then if you defect you go free (0 years) for turning A in
for the crime. If Prisoner A defects, you are better off defecting in this
instance, too, serving 5 years in jail rather than facing prison for 10 years.
Prisoner A, your partner, faces exactly the same choices and payoffs. Rational choice theory, which states that people will logically act in their own
best interests, argues that people will choose to defect. While people often
do make the choice to defect, real life and research with such dilemmas
has shown that defection was not always the rule. Clearly, something was
missing from the model.
The iterated prisoner’s dilemma. As research in this area expanded,
researchers investigated different payoff matrixes, framing the dilemma in

different terms, and then struck upon the idea that cooperation may be
helped by having repeated interactions with the same partners (Rappaport
& Chammah, 1965). Once researchers introduced iterated PD, cooperation
rates went up and it looked as if problem of cooperation had been solved.
Unfortunately, the iterated model also failed to explain fully the emergence
of cooperative systems. First, it could not explain why people occasionally
cooperate in a one-shot dilemma as described in the original description of
the dilemma. Second, it does not reflect real-life in which people can
choose to leave a partnership in which their needs are not being met.
Again, something was missing from the model.
Exit options. Recent research has offered some insight as to how the
next generation of social dilemmas might look and underscores the advantage of having a marker for trustworthiness and the conditions under which
such a marker might operate. In 1993, Orbell and Dawes broke with 30
years of tradition and allowed participants to “not play the game” by having the option of sitting out for as many rounds or iterations of a PD as they
would like. Orbell and Dawes’ results clearly showed that individuals who
were willing to cooperate were less willing to sit out and were able to form
more cooperative alliances from among the more cooperative players who

<-----Page 7----->170
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

remained in play. Orbell and Dawes (1993) named this effect the cooperator’s advantage and demonstrated that cooperators ended up with greater
wealth at the end of play than non-cooperators.
Boone and Macy (1999) extended the idea of sitting out by directly
testing an exit condition to the more traditional no-exit condition used in
most iterated prisoner’s dilemma studies. A vast majority of the research in
PD have always had participants without an option to exit, essentially locking them into “permanent relationships” and guaranteeing that in iterated
play, they would have to interact with one another repeatedly over time. In
their exit condition, Boone and Macy (1999) gave their participants the
option of leaving their partner to be randomly assigned a new partner from
one of the other 10 potential partners on every iteration, giving participants
the opportunity to escape a punitive or uncooperative partner. Interestingly
enough, while there was no overall difference in cooperation rate between
the two exit conditions, on an individual player level, dramatic shifts in
play were found when players were sorted by initial strategy. Specifically,
players who generally cooperated when playing with a new partner were
more highly cooperative in the exit condition as compared to the no exit
condition. In contrast, players who generally defected when playing with a
new partner became considerably less cooperative in the exit condition as
compared the no exit condition. The overall effect was that in the exit
condition, players showed considerably higher divergence in their cooperation levels, some becoming highly cooperative and some becoming
highly uncooperative, based upon their willingness to cooperate with a
new partner. As a result, more cooperative and trustworthy players found
more cooperative and trustworthy partners.
Accepting that the dilemma created by Boone and Macy (1999), namely
a dilemma with the option to exit, is a closer approximation of real life
than a simple iterated dilemma with no exit, then the evolution of cooperation should follow a somewhat different process than predicted by a noexit iterated dilemma. In an iterated game with permanent partners, players
must learn to cooperate. If players adopt a conditionally cooperative strategy, then cooperation will only occur if both partners understand that mutual defection is possible and self-defeating. However, with the option to
exit, learning drops by the wayside: Why stick around with someone who
has already defected on you and may defect again? The new path to success is to find a cooperator. If you are a cooperator, then you want someone with whom to cooperate in a long-term relationship so that you might
enjoy the cooperator’s advantage. If you are a defector, then you want to
find a cooperator to exploit. In either case, evolution should favor those
individuals who can locate cooperators. First impressions now become

<-----Page 8----->171
R. THOMAS BOONE, ROSS BUCK

critically important and ideally any marker for trustworthiness should be
readily assessed and utilized in a short period of time.
Central Proposition: Emotional Expressivity ⳱ Trustworthiness
Within the context of the social dilemma paradigm as described above, the
connection between emotional expressivity and trustworthiness becomes
clear. First, emotional expressivity does have an immediate impact upon
first impression. When exposed to emotionally expressive faces, humans
respond automatically with autonomic responses, facial muscle activity,
and specific regional brain activation (Oehman, 2002). Consensual judgments of personality based upon 2- and 5-second “thin slices” of videotaped nonverbal behavior have predicted evaluations of teachers (Ambady
& Rosenthal, 1992, 1993). In the research reported by Sabatelli and Rubin
(1986), judges made ratings of interpersonal attraction based upon watching individuals’ spontaneous reactions to emotion-inducing slides. From
these ratings a clear consensus emerged such that the more expressive individuals were rated more positively. Riggio and Friedman (1986) reported
a similar effect, though gender moderated the relationship between interpersonal liking and expressivity to some degree. From an evolutionary
point of view, the immediacy of such judgments would be helpful since it
would allow us successfully to cooperate with strangers. It also offers some
explanation as to why some individuals are willing to cooperate in oneshot dilemmas.
Logic also connects trustworthiness and emotional expressivity when
considering what the expressed emotions signal. Specifically, people who
are emotionally expressive are likely to reveal their motivational intentions.
This leakage has two effects. First, if an expressive person were to express
his or her intention to defect, then any partner might be able to detect that
intention and avoid cooperating with that person. In effect, if you broadcast your intentions, you might as well cooperate, at least on the first
move, since no one will play with a clear non-cooperator. Second, the
leakage allows players more immediate and ongoing feedback as to the
motivational state of their would-be partners. Being more emotionally expressive makes being trustworthy harder to fake and players would have
greater confidence that what they see is the true state of the person in
question. As noted, signals between potential adversaries that come at a
cost to the sender are considered to be more reliable (Frank, 1988; Zahavi,
1975, 1977).
Another reason for considering emotional expressivity as a major

<-----Page 9----->172
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

marker for trustworthiness is based upon the nature of the communication
process during social exchanges. Predicting someone’s trustworthiness is
maximally useful in a prospective sense; while it is important to know
when someone has cheated you, the real advantage is knowing when
someone might cheat you. This nuance moves this issue away from the
question of honesty, since the act of cooperation or defection has not happened, and more to the communication of intention. As such, when a person simply asserts that he or she will cooperate, there is no objective standard, no challenge of cognitive complexity, or other test that can cause
liars to fail (DePaulo et al., 2003; DePaulo, Stone, & Lassiter, 1985). The
only remaining component of lying behavior that might be detected is related to emotional leakage cues, again suggesting that emotionally expressive people would be at a disadvantage relative to their less expressive
peers if they were to attempt to defect. DePaulo (1992) made this point
directly with respect to individual differences in emotional expressivity and
the ability to deceive, arguing that people who are more expressive may be
less successful in deception.
Evidence
Empirical Research Focused on Communication Processes
in Social Dilemmas
Effects of communication. To date, only a small percentage of the research in social dilemmas has involved communication between participants. Researchers in social dilemmas have been primarily interested in
group effects and paid relatively little attention to individual level interactions or communicative processes. However, we have known for a long
time that face-to-face communication leads to higher levels of cooperation
(Dawes, McTavish, & Shaklee, 1977), and in a meta-analyses of social dilemma research, Sally (1995) reported a large increase in cooperation rate,
approximately 40%, when the participants were allowed to communicate
with each other. A total of 41 studies in this meta-analysis included some
sort of communication. Whether communication was allowed or not was
consistently the largest mediator, even compared to other mediators such
as type of payoff and temptation to defect (Sally, 1995).
Mechanisms of the communication effect. Despite the evidence that
communication between participants greatly increases cooperation, there
has been limited research examining the specific mechanism responsible
for this effect: whether for example verbal or nonverbal channels are nec-

<-----Page 10----->173
R. THOMAS BOONE, ROSS BUCK

essary and/or sufficient for the effect. One notable exception is a recently
published study by Kurzban (2001), who used a subtractive model to identify the critical bandwidth of interaction needed for communication to produce increased levels of cooperation. Kurzban found that, in all male
groups, mutual gaze, gentle touching, and pre-game interactions in an online chat room yielded higher levels of cooperation; while simply having
the players tap out a rhythmic sequence did not lead to higher levels of
cooperation. While qualified by a gender effect and not definitive in terms
of the specific communicative mechanisms used to induce cooperation,
this research strongly suggests that nonverbal communication alone may
be sufficient for the coordination of cooperative behavior.
Another relevant study was conducted by Frank, Gilovich, and Regan
(1993). Participants were allowed to interact for 30 minutes prior to playing in a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma. Players were allowed to communicate about anything except about how they intended to play during the
game. Prior to play, participants were asked to evaluate their partners on a
series of dimensions and were also asked whether they felt their partners
would cooperate. Cooperation was higher when communication was permitted and people who felt that their partners were going to be cooperative
were more cooperative themselves. In fact, while the overall effect was
increased cooperation, the more interesting phenomenon was that the
dyads seemed to feel themselves out with accuracy—the dyads either
locked into mutual cooperation or mutual defection, with far fewer cases
of one partner taking advantage of the other. Results also revealed that
participants were well above chance in predicting the decision of their
partners, arguing that communication of intention was clearly established.
Theoretical models for the communication effect. Theoretical models
for the effect of communication on cooperation have paralleled the empirical work. Several theorists have pointed out the critical role communication must play on allowing for social coordination in social exchange systems (Burnham, McCabe, & Smith, 2000; Cosmides & Tooby, 1992; Frank,
1988; Sally, 2000). Cosmides and Tooby demonstrated that there appear to
be “special-purpose cognitive mechanisms” that separate a general purpose logic system and logic relating to the detection of cheating in social
exchange situations. More importantly, their identification of this special
purpose cognitive mechanism stresses the critical importance of assessing
the trustworthiness of partners in social exchange. Burnham et al. take this
one step further and argue that humans have a specific mental module for
the identifying others as a friend or foe. Sally (2000) offered a theory of
“mind-reading” in which the two participants must be able to understand

<-----Page 11----->174
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

the motivational state of the other as way by which communication leads
to greater cooperation. What all of these theories lack is an explication of
the specific mechanisms by which such inferences are made and a recognition of the critical role of the nonverbal communication of emotion plays
in such a process. We argue that the interpersonal communication of emotion, based upon emotional expressivity, is a critical component to establishing conditions under which two people, even strangers, can feel each
other out as trustworthy or untrustworthy.
From an evolutionary perspective, it is interesting to note research on
nonhuman primates that suggests that nonverbal behavior is used to communicate trust (Silk, 2001). In this research, observers described the situations in
which females of differing social status and dominance came together for
mutual benefit. While some females were clearly more aggressive than
others, most females were willing to interact with each other for the purposes
of grooming. For this to occur, the more aggressive females had to signal that
they would not aggress against the less aggressive females while involved in
a grooming exchange. The researchers identified specific signals embedded
in coughs and low grunts of a particular frequency that appeared to signal
that the more aggressive females intend no harm (are trustworthy) and the
less aggressive females would be safe in their interactions with the more
aggressive females. Similar signals have also been shown to reduce aggression and to precede affiliative interaction, and they were seldom misrepresentative of the sender’s intention (Silk, 2001).
Given that emotional displays and communication are nonverbal, and
the previous argument about the signaling of intentions, it is likely that the
critical component involved in communicating trustworthiness operates on
a nonverbal level. In fact, the lower level of cooperation noted when participants are not allowed to interact interpersonally could be the effect of
removing critical nonverbal/emotional cues associated with assessing trustworthiness. The value of adding indicators of trustworthiness to the interaction could account for a good deal of the increase in cooperation when
players were allowed to communicate noted by Dawes et al. (1977). The
time has clearly come for nonverbal/emotion communication research to
be injected into the social dilemma paradigm.
Empirical Research Involving Emotional Signaling in Social Exchange
Facial mimicry. In addition to the studies that have considered the role
of communication in social exchange, there is also evidence that supports
the specific role of emotional signaling in social exchange. In an effort to
demonstrate that facial mimicry effects are subject to expectancy effects,

<-----Page 12----->175
R. THOMAS BOONE, ROSS BUCK

Lanzetta and Englis (1989) led individuals to believe that they were interacting with a cooperative or competitive partner in an investment game
with monetary rewards for successful outcomes and shocks for unsuccessful outcomes. In reality, the participants viewed a pre-recorded videotape
of a partner who smiled and grimaced in accordance with a pre-arranged
series of plays, both during an active play period and observation period.
EMG electrodes measured participants’ facial muscles to assess mimicry
effects for smiles and grimaces in response to the pre-recorded videotape.
As hypothesized, individuals did manifest mimicry effects consistent with
their expectations about the partner. Individuals who expected a cooperative partner showed relaxed muscles when their partner smiled, and distressed and aroused muscle activation when their partner grimaced. In
contrast, individuals who expected a competitive partner demonstrated relaxed facial muscles when their partner grimaced and aroused muscle activation when their partner smiled. The presence of vicarious emotional responses that are both relevant and adaptive to the specific situation is a
strong argument for the role of emotional signaling in social exchange.
Mood effects. Though slightly removed from social dilemma research,
Forgas (1998) demonstrated the effects of mood on negotiation strategy,
again underscoring the role of emotions in the decision to cooperate or
defect. Specifically, Forgas showed that individuals who were induced into
a positive mood were more willing to be cooperative and more successful
as negotiators than individuals induced into a negative mood. Though the
research really assessed willingness to be cooperative, it is clear that individuals’ emotional state clearly had impact in both expectation and
planned behavior. Indeed, a second result from the same research revealed
that the perceived mood of the opposition also induced mood-congruent
negotiation strategies and outcomes. Participants cooperated more and employed more successful negotiation strategies with happy partners than
dysphoric partners. Emotions, arguably by signaling intent, clearly can play
a role in indicating when a person is willing to be cooperative and trustworthy and when a person is not.
Other research on mood effects in social dilemmas has shown varied
effects, in part based upon situational constraints and expectations. A review of the literature in this area has shown that the focus is often
on how mood effects lead to heuristics that either activate cooperative
schemas and trust and how mood may impact feelings of security, which,
in turn, mediate cooperative behavior (Hertel, 1999). Interestingly, most of
this research has used mood induction and false feedback rather than relying on affect as a communicative system. The varied results to date could

<-----Page 13----->176
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

be due in part to partial signals outside the appropriate ecological situation
of direct nonverbal/emotional communication between senders and receivers of trust. Again, it is clear that research on social dilemmas could be
significantly improved by examining cooperation as a communicative process, more specifically as a process driven by emotion communication.
Implications
Developing a Model for the Communication of Trustworthiness
Previous research and models have focused on trust as a quality that
someone has; we argue that trust is something someone does when another person, a potential partner, appears to be trustworthy. By shifting the
focus away from trust to trustworthiness, trust becomes automatic when the
quality of trustworthiness is successfully communicated. The search for an
“altruistic personality” may have been stymied because of the focus on the
altruistic individual—the “sender” of altruism—rather than the conditions
under which individuals are likely to receive cues encouraging them to be
altruistic.
An additional advantage to viewing trustworthiness as a communicative process is that we can now use a Lens Model approach (Brunswik,
1955; Petronvich, 1979). In such a model, a sender must display the qualities that indicate that they are trustworthy and the receiver must make the
correct inference that trustworthy senders are just that—trustworthy. The
big questions addressed by such a model are straightforward: Are there
some cues that reliably indicate trustworthiness? What cues do people use
to infer trustworthiness? Can trustworthiness be faked?2
Our contention is that emotional expressivity is a cue to trustworthiness. To prove such an effect, measures of cooperation and measures of
expressivity, ideally both within a cooperative situation and during a second, but separate interaction, would have to be obtained. Given the previous research of Sabatelli and Rubin (1986), spontaneous emotional expressivity would be the primary focus of interest, but eventually this
research would have to consider the effects of intentionally posed expressions of emotions as well. Intentionally posed or enacted expressions
should also provide insight about whether individuals try to fake expressivity in order to appear more trustworthy, and whether such attempts are
successful. Perhaps some “charismatic” individuals are able to successfully
enact high levels of expressivity that cause them to betrusted.
Independent of whether emotional expressivity is a marker for trustworthiness, it is also of interest to explore whether people are, in fact, good

<-----Page 14----->177
R. THOMAS BOONE, ROSS BUCK

“mind-readers,” that is, whether they can judge accurately that a target
individual is more or less trustworthy. Such an analysis would parallel what
has been done in research on nonverbal/emotional cues to deception.
While there are markers for who is deceitful and who is not, people do not
always use these cues (DePaulo et al., 2003; DePaulo, Stone, & Lassiter,
1985). Instead, people tend to use a separate set of cues, only some of
which accurately reveal who is lying and who is not, resulting in only
chance level identification of who is lying and who is not among most
persons. Such an analysis also could be used to address whether some
people are better judges as to who is trustworthy and whether it is possible
to become more sensitive at detecting trustworthiness or untrustworthiness.
Beyond Emotional Expressivity and Trustworthiness
Certainly there is plenty of research that would stem from a communication model of trustworthiness, but if the relationship between trustworthiness and emotional expressivity is upheld, there are several other obvious
research areas that warrant investigation. Of primary importance is the
question of whether trustworthiness is a stable dispositional quality or if
trustworthiness is emitted as a function of situational conditions, or both. In
any case, emotional expressivity is well-suited to be the mechanism by
which trustworthiness is communicated. If trustworthiness is a dispositional
quality, we would expect to find that some people are more cooperative
and hence more trustworthy than others across a wide range of situations.
There is evidence that expressivity is dispositional in that it is correlated
with relevant personality and physiological measures: more expressive
people are more extraverted, higher in self-esteem, and lower in autonomic responding, suggesting that more expressive people are generally
disinhibited (Buck, 1977, 1979; Sheehan, 2002). More expressive people
should be generally “easier to read,” but they also may be more likely to
attend to, and therefore detect, cues of trustworthiness in others. Though
no research has shown a specific relationship between dispositional expressivity and trustworthiness, such a finding would be consistent with research on empathy and the notion of an altruistic personality.
If trustworthiness is not a stable characteristic per se, but driven more
by situational signals that inform the individual as to who is more trustworthy on a case by case basis, then situational signals are most likely to be
effective within the context of a given interaction. Again, affective signals,
specifically expressive responses to the demands of the situation, could be
a marker for cooperative or non-cooperative intention. Being more expressive in response to situational or environmental cues would allow any

<-----Page 15----->178
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

would-be partner to assess the target individual’s willingness to cooperate.
Indeed, it may be the case that more trustworthy people have a wider
range of cues that elicit a telling expressive response, rather than a personality attribute that dictates that the individual must be cooperative.
Whether there is a disposition to be trustworthy or a learned set of
behaviors that make a person appear more trustworthy, the developmental
antecedents of trustworthiness are worth exploring. Given the role of emotions in this process, early attachment is a strong candidate for being critical to the development of the appropriate emotion signaling skills. As previously mentioned, empathy and perspective taking skills may also be
related to judgments of trustworthiness, with more empathic and responsive people being seen as more expressive and therefore more trustworthy.
Contrariwise, unexpressive persons are likely to be marked as having low
levels of trustworthiness even if they may tend to be cooperative. Furthermore, expressive and charismatic sociopaths may be highly adept at fooling their victims.
A connection between emotional expressivity and trustworthiness
would have a significant effect on a variety of social variables such as
gender and age. In American culture, adult women generally tend to be
more spontaneously emotionally expressive than men (Buck, 1979; 1984).
Therefore, the positive relationship between expressivity and trustworthiness may mean that women are generally deemed more trustworthy. Alternatively, expressivity may have a different effect with women than men.
Indeed, given Kurzban’s (2001) finding that the effects of communication
on cooperation were only found for male-only groups, it is possible that
women’s expressivity may be viewed as either a neutral signal or possibly
even a negative signal for trustworthiness. In their study of “perfidious feminine faces,” Bugental, Love, and Gianetto (1971) found that smiling on the
part of the father was responded to as a positive cue by children, while
smiling on the part of the mother was not. Furthermore, expectations about
children’s trustworthiness and stereotypes of honesty applied to baby-faced
individuals (Zebrowitz & Montepare, 1992) may also be driven by the relatively higher level of emotional signaling used by children.
Finally, the relationship between emotional expressiveness and trustworthiness has important practical implications. With the advent of the
Internet and communication that is relatively devoid of nonverbal expressive emotional content, trustworthiness and cooperation may be relatively
easier to manipulate and harder to assess. Indeed, with a creative and expressive use of written language, it is possible for a sociopath to pass as a
trustworthy peer to an unwary adolescent. Traditionally, we still rely on
face-to-face meetings for important business decisions, such as purchasing

<-----Page 16----->179

a house and the signing of treaties. If expressivity is indeed an important
signal for trustworthiness, it suggests that on-line conferences would be
better served with real-time cameras and video-conferencing that permit
greater nonverbal-expressive emotional communication.
Summary
Recent theorizing utilizing an evolutionary perspective has highlighted the
important role of trustworthiness as an interpersonal quality that fosters the
emergence of cooperative systems. Based upon a convergence of evidence
from a wide range of sources, we argue that trust, or more accurately the
communication of trustworthiness, is primarily an affective process and is
governed, in part, through the communication of emotion. However, unlike straightforward emotional processes like those that signal avoidance
and approach, the emotional processes that govern this set of relational
behaviors are based in part upon expectancy effects and the communication of complex motivational/emotional states. Emotional expressivity,
which refers to the degree to which individuals accurately communicate
their feeling states, is helpful to the cooperative process in that it reveals
the desires and intentions of the individual and allows others to make
heuristic decisions such as whether to cooperate or not. We also argue that
there is a clear need to inject nonverbal emotionally expressive behavior
into social dilemma research, which has downplayed or ignored its influence in the communication processes associated with cooperation. Finally,
we offer an outline for testing our theory and expanding the consideration
of the role of nonverbal/emotional processes within research on cooperation and social exchange.
Notes
1. Clearly there is overlap between the constructs of honesty and trustworthiness. To date,
most research involving honesty has been about deception—when people are not honest.
To that end, the focus has been on the specific cues that occur when a target person is
attempting to deceive and the situational constraints that increase or decrease the likelihood of detecting that deception. As such, deception, or lack of honesty, is defined by the
unique situation and is not readily generalized beyond that situation. In contrast, trustworthiness is seen more as a global characteristic that is not based upon a specific instance
of behavior.
Research examining an “honest demeanor,” such as the work of Bond, Berry, and
Omar (1994) and Zebrowitz, Voinescu, and Collins (1996), is closer to our “trustworthiness.” Indeed, these constructs have more overlap, particularly in a zero-acquaintance
situation. However, trustworthiness arguably represents a more complex construct since it

<-----Page 17----->180
JOURNAL OF NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR

generally involves a relationship over time and is a more dynamic process. Further, research on an honest demeanor has focused primarily on appearances and has not considered more interactive components. Indeed, Bond et al. and Zebrowitz et al. had participants base their judgments on static photos, focusing almost solely on biases based upon
physical appearance to the exclusion of other sources of information.
2. While we feel that trustworthiness is distinct from honesty, the methodology used to explore both constructs may be similar on occasion. Specifically, the focus of research identifying critical cues occurring when a person is less likely to be trustworthy is similar to
identifying cues that indicate when a person is lying.
