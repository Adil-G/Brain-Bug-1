Abstract
In this article we use a simple queuing network to model the process through which entrepreneurs receive venture
capital funding. Our model focuses in particular on the allocation of venture capitalistsÕ attention between pre- and
post-investment activities, and on the degree of selectivity in deciding which ventures to fund. Based upon this model we
develop expressions for the ﬁnancial performance of the venture capital process, both overall and also from the perspectives of the entrepreneurs, investors, managers, and venture capitalists involved. For these ﬁnancial measures we
derive the optimal allocation of attention between pre- and post-investment activities, and the optimal proportion of
venture proposals to accept. Further analysis shows how these diﬀerent ﬁnancial measures and optimal values respond
to changes in the business climate. More interestingly, our analysis also shows where and to what extent the diﬀerent
parties could be expected to agree or disagree on how best to manage the process.

1. Introduction
Cooperative relationships between venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs are necessary for the
success of VC backed companies (Sapienza and Korsgaard, 1996; Steier and Greenwood, 1995; Cable and
Shane, 1997). Timmons and Bygrave (1986) propose that the cooperative relationship between a VC and
entrepreneur is more important to the success of the business than the capital itself. While it appears that
co-operation provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts, it does not characterise all VC–entrepreneur relationships
(Sahlman, 1990). There is a degree of uncertainty that the VC will pursue his or her own self interests rather
than comply with the requirements of the contract for venture capital, i.e., VCs face agency risk (adapted

from Fiet (1995)). This agency perspective oﬀers a description of the risks a principal (the VC) faces when
dealing with an agent (the entrepreneur) and actions that the VC can take to ‘‘force’’ the entrepreneur to
co-operate. For example, the VC can introduce penalties for defection including a dilution of the entrepreneurÕs equity in the venture (Sahlman, 1990), replacement of the entrepreneur with professional management (Barney et al., 1996; Hoﬀman and Blakely, 1987) and through compensation structures (Sahlman,
1990).
There has been less research, however, about the incentives for VCs to pursue opportunistic behaviour at
the expense of co-operation (and at the expense of the entrepreneur). In this case the VC can be considered
the agent and the entrepreneur the principal (Cable and Shane, 1997). For example, VCs may act
opportunistically to harvest a venture (and obtain their proﬁts) rather than reinvest in the ventureÕs future
products and development (Sahlman, 1990), they may pressure the entrepreneur to seek short-term proﬁts
(Gomez-Mejia et al., 1990) even to the detriment of long-term proﬁtability and/or the VCs may underinvest
in the venture (Cable and Shane, 1997; Gorman and Sahlman, 1989; Bygrave and Timmons, 1991). For
another example, VCs often face situations where they are ﬂooded with entrepreneursÕ requests for
ﬁnancing (in the form of lengthy business plans) and simultaneously need to assist current portfolio ventures in improving performance. The more active VCs spend 35 hours per month per venture assisting the
management team, while less active ﬁrms spend less than 7 hours per month per investment (Elango et al.,
1995).
Therefore, it appears that VCs may opportunistically manage the venture capital process in a way that
advantages them and disadvantages the entrepreneur. Furthermore, entrepreneurs are not the only
stakeholders of the venture capital process and the way that it is managed likely impacts the desirability of
the outcome for these other stakeholder groups. For example, scholars have relatively ignored the relationship between VC ﬁrms and their funds providers (Robbie et al., 1997).
The important question is how should time, eﬀort and/or resources within the VC ﬁrm be allocated? The
optimal allocation likely depends on the perspective taken. What is optimal for the VC might not be
optimal for the entrepreneur or the limited partners supplying the fundÕs capital to the VC. Therefore,
rather than focus on the control mechanisms that a VC can use to ensure the entrepreneur acts in a cooperative manner, this paper investigates the way the VC process is managed and its impact on the
desirability of the outcome, as perceived by the diﬀerent stakeholder groups.
The above discussion leads to this paperÕs two key research questions. What is the allocation of a VC
ﬁrmÕs attention (time, talent, and treasure) between pre-investment activities and post-investment activities
that is considered optimal across all stakeholders? How and under what conditions is the allocation of
attention that is optimal for the process overall (i.e. is best for the common good) diﬀerent from what might
be preferred by the various stakeholders (entrepreneurs, investors, managers and employees)? We investigate these important questions by using a queuing network model. A queuing network is a system of
queues (waiting lines) where the departures from one queue become the arrivals at another. Queuing
networks are useful models of systems that involve some form of customer ﬂow (e.g., of venture proposals)
amongst various locations (e.g., stages in the venture capital process) where the inherent variability of the
ﬂow can lead to line-ups and delays at a given location (e.g., an overﬂowing stack of proposals to review).
Despite the usefulness of this approach to the investigation of the venture capital process it has yet to be
used for this purpose, though it is often used to evaluate systems of machines in a factory (e.g., Papadopoulos et al., 1993) or the operations of health care service providers (e.g., Bretthauer and Cote, 1998).
By addressing these important issues facing VC ﬁrms, the present article makes a number of contributions to the literature. First, a VC ﬁrm (as all ﬁrms) has a number of stakeholders each with diﬀerent
expectations and aspirations for the ﬁrm. This article provides a deeper understanding of the trade-oﬀs
amongst these stakeholder groups. Second, research on the VC process has made a signiﬁcant contribution
to the literature, in particular Tyebjee and Bruno (1984), although such process research is limited in
number. This article builds on these primarily descriptive studies, to provide a decision model with

<-----Page 2----->D.A. Shepherd et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 163 (2005) 545–564

547

prescriptive beneﬁts. Such beneﬁts are likely to have important practical implications for the managers of
VC ﬁrms and may also beneﬁt other entrepreneurial ﬁnancing ﬁrms (e.g., the Small Business Development
Corporation).
Third, the allocation of attention is an important issue as individual VCs have limited time and energy to
allocate among the various tasks of the venture capital process. To VC ﬁrms, VCs represent a costly resource to acquire and maintain (i.e., a substantial ﬁxed cost for the VC ﬁrm) and represent the basis of a VC
ﬁrmÕs competitive advantage. Thus, VCsÕ time is valuable resource that needs to be eﬀectively managed.
This paper provides prescriptions on how the process can be managed to provide a higher proﬁt for the VC
ﬁrm. But the support of stakeholders is also important and this paper provides some insight into the
possible reactions of diﬀerent stakeholder groups depending on how the process has been managed.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. We begin by reviewing the existing research on the VC
process. We then describe our assumptions about the venture capital process in terms of operations and
ﬁnancing. Based upon these assumptions, we formulate models of ﬁnancial performance for the VC process
from the diﬀerent viewpoints of the investors, managers, and VC employees. We analyse these diﬀerent
measures of performance to investigate how they would vary in response to changing business conditions,
and more interestingly how the diﬀerent entities involved would likely agree or disagree regarding the
management of the process. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of the model and suggest
possible avenues for future research. Appendix A contains the details of our mathematical analysis.

2. Venture capital process
The VC process can be thought of as a series of activities or stages that each new venture works through
from the time the venture is ﬁrst proposed, up until the time when the VC ﬁrm successfully exits from the
venture and takes its proﬁt. For example, Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) proposed a model of the venture
capital process with ﬁve such stages: deal origination, deal screening, deal evaluation, deal structuring and
post-investment. Because of our particular focus in this paper, we use a broader classiﬁcation with only two
categories of VC activities that encapsulate the ﬁve stages proposed above.
The ﬁrst category, ‘‘pre-investment activities’’, refers to all VC tasks up to and including the signing of
an investment contract: soliciting new venture proposals for submission to the VC ﬁrm, determining
whether these proposals meet the ﬁrmÕs broad screening criteria, conducting due diligence (more extensive
research to determine the likely success of the venture), and then negotiating and structuring a relationship
with the entrepreneur. It should be noted that in the 1980s, most proposals that the VC ﬁrm received were
referrals from third parties including other VCs and that VCs spent little time in searching for deals––the
task was rather passive (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984). However, more recently the industry can be characterised by greater competition between VC ﬁrms increasing the need for VC ﬁrms to be more proactive in
this task, i.e., allocate more time to it (cf. Sweeting, 1991). VCs diﬀer in the screening criteria they use to
select ventures including type of industry, industry stage of development, geographic location, and size of
investment required. These are detailed in lists of VCs, for example PrattÕs Guide to Venture Capital
Sources (1998). There is considerable research on how VCs use the information gathered from due diligence
to make their assessment of likely success; e.g., VCs typically use decision criteria such as entrepreneur/team
characteristics, product/service characteristics, and market and ﬁnancial characteristics (Zacharakis and
Meyer, 1998). Eventually the relationship between the VC ﬁrm and the entrepreneur needs to be developed
and formalised (i.e., the terms of the venture capital contract need to be negotiated and agreed upon) in
order for the venture investment, and hence the ‘‘pre-investment activities’’, to be completed.
The second category, ‘‘post-investment activities’’, includes all actions by the VC ﬁrm after the initial
investment deal has been signed. In general this involves providing guidance (and possibly additional
funding) to help improve the performance of the venture. One of the most important beneﬁts arising from a

<-----Page 3----->548

relationship with a VC is access to their extensive network. This is often utilised to ﬁnd and recruit top
quality management, to ﬁnd other co-investors for immediate or follow up investment, to introduce the
venture to important service providers such as specialised accountants, and to help ﬁnd and develop
necessary strategic alliances (Sandberg, 1986). Furthermore, VCs often serve as sounding board for
management ideas, and are a valuable source of strategic and operational advice (Lerner, 1994, 1995;
Sweeting, 1991; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984).
Ultimately, the VCÕs ﬁnal action is to exit from the venture. The VC can exit from the venture using one
of ﬁve vehicles: (1) an IPO exist where after an initial public oﬀering the VC sells the ﬁrmÕs shares in the
venture to the market (this may occur some period after the IPO), (2) an acquisition exist where the VC,
and all other owners, sell the entire venture to a third party, (3) a secondary sale where the VC ﬁrms sells its
share in the venture to a third party but for this vehicle the entrepreneur and other owners do not sell their
shares, (4) a buyback exit where the VC ﬁrm sells it shares in the venture to the entrepreneur and/or the
venture itself, and (5) a write-oﬀ exit, which typically involves the failure of the venture (Cumming and
MacIntosh, 2003).
3. Queuing network model and assumptions
3.1. VC process––Operations
We begin by constructing a model of the operation of the VC process for a generic VC ﬁrm. For this
purpose we have chosen to use an open queuing network with three nodes (labelled N1, N2, and N3; see
Fig. 1) through which ventures ﬂow. Node N1 represents the involvement of the proposed venture and a
VC ﬁrm in ‘‘pre-investment activities’’; similarly, N3 represents the involvement of a funded venture and a
VC ﬁrm in ‘‘post-investment activities’’. Node N2 represents the development eﬀorts of a funded venture
during periods that do not require the responsible VC ﬁrm to be actively involved.
Entrepreneurs with venture ideas that require ﬁnancing submit their proposals on an unscheduled (i.e.,
random) basis to the VC ﬁrm for consideration; on average, we suppose that k venture proposals arrive at
node N1 (‘‘evaluation of new ventures’’) each year. We will phrase our discussion in terms of years, but this
choice of time units is unimportant (one could just as well use, e.g., months). The amount of time it takes a
VC to perform all of the pre-investment activities (e.g., screening, evaluation, structuring) varies from one
venture to another; we shall assume that on average the VC ﬁrm can deal with sa proposals per year. We
use s to represent the proportion of VC attention (time, eﬀort, etc.) devoted to pre-investment activities (so s
takes values between 0 and 1), and a as the average number of ventures the VCs could handle per year if
they devoted all of their attention to this category of activity. Note that depending on the rate at which
proposals arrive and the amount of attention devoted to working with them, a given proposal may have to

wait (queued-up in the VCÕs in-basket) before being looked at by the VC. We assume that the average
capacity sa is larger than the average total proposal submission rate k (otherwise work could pile-up
without end). Given these assumptions, we can model N1 as a single server queue with service rate sa. Once
the VCs have ﬁnished processing a venture proposal at N1, the proposal has either successfully passed the
screening and evaluation (with probability p) or it has failed (with probability 1  p). Ventures, which pass,
receive funding and proceed to N2; ventures, which fail, are rejected by the VC and leave the system.
Ventures at node N2 (‘‘ventures in development’’) are in the ﬁrmÕs funded portfolio and are undergoing
development. This represents a period of time where the entrepreneurs do not require a signiﬁcant assistance from the VC, i.e., entrepreneurs have their funding and are working to ﬁne-tune, produce, and sell
their new product or service. We assume that a venture spends an average amount of time c in development
before again requiring the VCÕs attention. Because no signiﬁcant VC assistance is required here, there is
never a line-up of idle ventures; they are all busy with development. We can therefore model N2 as an
inﬁnite server queue with service rate 1=c.
Eventually a venture will again require the attention of a VC at the ﬁrm, for any of several possible
reasons. The entrepreneur may simply require some management advice or other non-monetary assistance
from the VC. The venture may be succeeding, so that the VCÕs attention is required to manage the exit
process (IPO or trade sale); on the other hand, the venture may be failing, so that the VC may need to
become involved in salvage eﬀorts. It is also possible that the venture may have spent all of its previous
rounds of capital and needs additional funding, or whatever the reason, at this point the venture will leave
this node N2 and proceed to N3.
Ventures at N3 (‘‘assistance to funded ventures’’) are still in the funded portfolio, but are either receiving
assistance from the VC or are waiting their turn to do so; in either case, we suppose that their development
eﬀorts are temporarily on hold. We assume that the VCs can handle tb ventures per year at this node. We let
t indicate the proportion of VC attention devoted to post-investment activities (e.g., providing advice,
arranging extra funding, managing the exit process), and b indicate the average number of ventures the VCs
could deal with in a year if they devoted all of their attention to post-investment work. Note that s þ t ¼ 1.
Like N1, we can also model N3 as a single server queue with service rate tb; we again assume that the
average work capacity tb is larger than the average workload (which we later show to be kpf ). A venture
which completes service at N3 either continues with its development eﬀorts (with probability n), achieves a
successful exit (with probability l), or fails outright (with probability m); note that l þ m þ n ¼ 1.
A venture that leaves N3 either due to a successful exit or because it has failed is no longer in the funded
portfolio but rather has left the system. In contrast, a venture that leaves N3 to resume development returns
to N2 and remains in the portfolio. The returning venture then carries on with its development eﬀorts until
it once again needs a VCÕs intervention. We refer to this return path as a ‘‘feedback loop’’, as a venture may
cycle many times between development eﬀorts (at N2) and obtaining assistance (at N3). For later calculations concerning this feedback of repeating ventures, it will be convenient to deﬁne a feedback factor
f ¼ 1=ð1  nÞ. This f is the average number of times a funded venture engages in development eﬀorts at
N2: one initial visit, plus (f  1) repeat visits. Due to this feedback eﬀect, at any point in time only some of
the ventures at each of N2 and N3 are there for the ﬁrst time. A smaller number are there for their ﬁrst
repeat visit, and still smaller numbers are there for their second, third, etc. repeat visits.
Deﬁned in this way our model of the VC process forms a simple Jackson open queuing network with
three nodes. This type of queuing network has a steady state distribution in product form, which allows the
analysis of each node and the ﬂow between nodes to be handled in a relatively simple manner (e.g., Gelenbe
and Pujolle, 1987). The average ﬂows on each arc of the network (in number of ventures per year) are
derived in Appendix A and are shown in Fig. 1. These ﬂow rates can in turn be used to derive the average
number of ventures present at each node in the systemÕs steady state (see Appendix A for details). The
expected number of ventures undergoing or awaiting VC pre-investment processing at N1 is V1 ¼ k=ðsa  k)
while the expected total number of ventures undergoing or awaiting VC post-investment assistance at N3 is

<-----Page 5----->550

D.A. Shepherd et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 163 (2005) 545–564

V3 ¼ kpf =ðtb  kpf ). The expected number of ventures undergoing development (at N2) is given by
V2 ¼ kpfc; of this total, kpc are there for the ﬁrst time, while the remaining kpcðf  1Þ are ‘‘repeaters’’, i.e.,
this is their second or subsequent period of development eﬀort.
It is worth emphasising that these expressions for venture ﬂows and status are all long-run averages; the
actual number of ventures moving from N2 to N3 for example may vary greatly from year to year due to
variation in arrival and service times. It is this variation (or randomness) that causes line-ups and delays at
N1 and N3, in spite of the fact that each of these nodes has suﬃcient processing capacity to handle its
average workload.
Although there is a fair amount of detail in this operating model of the VC ﬁrm and process, it is still of
course a major simpliﬁcation of reality. For example, we have not made any distinction amongst senior
VCs (partners in the ﬁrm), junior VCs (associates), and support staﬀ (such as administrative assistants) in
regards to their productivity in working with ventures. Nor have we considered whether individual VCs
specialise in just one type of task (e.g., screening new venture proposals) or are instead generalists who deal
with the entire process. We simply consider the VCs in aggregate, and assume that the ﬁrm is able to adjust
its overall allocation of attention in some manner (by re-assignment of VCs, training and development,
hiring and ﬁring, etc.).
3.2. VC process––Revenues and expenditures
We assume that each venture that successfully completes the pre-investment activities (N1) and commences development (at N2) receives an initial lump sum capital investment of an average of I dollars from
the VC investment fund. Similarly, each time a venture recommences development (at N2) after receiving
assistance from the VC during post-investment (N3) it receives an additional capital investment of an
average of J dollars; we expect that typically I P J P 0. Note that this follow-on investment can occur
many times (since a venture may visit N2 and N3 many times) and that J is simply the average amount; thus
ventures that merely require management advice would not receive any additional money at this point.
A venture that successfully completes its development exits the portfolio (from N3). At this time the
venture is assumed to have attained a considerable value and could be sold to provide an average capital
revenue (the ‘‘proceeds from harvest’’) of RðpÞ. Portion rRðpÞ is allotted to the VC fund, while the remaining
amount ð1  rÞRðpÞ is retained by the entrepreneur, where proportion r 2 ½0; 1. For modelling purposes we
treat these as lump sums received at time of exit, since a VCÕs return comes primarily from the selling of
equity in the venture; in some cases they may represent the present value of a future revenue stream (e.g., if
the entrepreneur retains her equity stake rather than selling). Here we assume that the average revenue per
exit is a function of the quality controls that the VCs use when they perform their pre-investment activities.
All else being equal, we would expect that the higher the proportion p of proposals that are accepted, the
lower the average quality of these ventures and thus the lower the average revenue from their eventual exit.
To model this, we assume that the average revenue function RðpÞ is decreasing in p at an accelerating rate,
0
00
so RðpÞ 6 0 and RðpÞ 6 0. This revenue covers the investments in the venture and other associated costs as
well as providing a proﬁt. Ventures that fail at N3 also leave the portfolio but provide zero revenue. Note
that here and in the rest of this paper for convenience we assume that all payments are measured on an
after-tax basis.
In addition to these investment revenues and expenditures, the VC process involves a number of other
payments amongst participants. The investment fund (i.e., the limited partners or investors) pays the VC
ﬁrm (1) a yearly management fee of proportion z 2 ½0; 1 of the fundÕs assets, and (2) a performance bonus
of proportion x 2 ½0; 1 of that part of the fundÕs annual return that exceeds a set target rate (the ‘‘hurdle
rate’’) of k P 0. For example, the fund may be set up so that any returns in excess of 40% per year (k ¼ 0:40)
are shared, with 1/4 of this excess going to the VC ﬁrm (x ¼ 0:25) and the remaining 3/4 going to the
investors (1  x ¼ 0:75).

<-----Page 6----->D.A. Shepherd et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 163 (2005) 545–564

551

In turn, the ﬁrm must pay its VC employees a total of H dollars per year in salaries and beneﬁts. In
addition to this base salary cost, the ﬁrm rewards the VCs with a commission of proportion y 2 ½0; x of that
part of the fundÕs annual return that exceeds the set target rate, with x > y. Beyond paying its VCs, we
assume that the ﬁrm also must pay a total of G dollars per year in overhead expenses; this could cover such
things as rent, wages for a receptionist or accounting staﬀ, etc.
3.3. VC process––major actors
Although there may be many individuals involved in the VC process, herein we consider four main
groups: investors, managers, employees, and entrepreneurs. Investors supply the funds to invest in ventures;
depending on how the ﬁrm is structured, these may be limited partners in the ﬁrm or they may be purchasers of mutual fund units. By managers, we mean the general partners (if the VC ﬁrm is a partnership),
or the major shareholders (if the ﬁrm is a corporation); these are the people who make the major decisions
and beneﬁt from any residual proﬁt or loss by the company. By employees we mean the venture capitalists
who actually do the pre- and post-investment work with the ventures; they may be junior associates or
employees of the ﬁrm. In some cases, individual investors (often referred to as Business Angels) ﬁll all three
roles simultaneously: they provide the funds, manage the investment, and advise the ventures (cf. Harrison
et al., 1997). Entrepreneurs of course supply the initial venture ideas and subsequently develop them using
the venture funding. In the next section we consider what the objectives of these diﬀerent groups might be,
and how these objectives are aﬀected by the operation of the VC process.

4. Financial objectives
In this section we combine the above ﬁnancial assumptions with our queuing network model of the VC
process to construct several ﬁnancial models of the VC process. The reader may ﬁnd it helpful to refer to
Table 1 for a summary of the notation introduced.
4.1. Investors
4.1.1. Goals
The investors provide the funds to invest in ventures in exchange for a future return to their investment.
They thus would clearly be interested in the performance of these venture investments, but presumably
would be interested in the rest of the VC ﬁrm (the managers and employees) only to the extent that the ﬁrm
is managing these investments on their behalf. We therefore shall assume that the goal of the investors is to
maximise their return on investment (ROI) from the venture portfolio (Dean and Giglierano, 1990;
Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998). ROI is calculated as an annual percentage ratio by dividing the portfolioÕs
annual income by the amount of money invested in that portfolio.
4.1.2. Process
To derive the average amount invested in the portfolio, we need to know when money enters the
portfolio and becomes available for investment. It is clear that funds have to be available at least some
amount of time before they can be provided to a venture; thus any investment portfolio will consist partly
of cash (awaiting investment) and partly of actual venture investments. This would be especially true for
those VC ﬁrms that run their portfolios as mutual funds; cash could arrive (from the sale of fund units) and
then sit idle for some time until it is invested. Rather than trying to directly model this fund-raising process
and its time lags, we will simply choose a reasonable point in time as an approximation. We assume herein
that money to invest in a venture becomes available (at least on average) at the moment that a venture

proposal ﬁrst arrives at the VC ﬁrm (i.e. at N1), even though the actual investment will not occur until after
the venture successfully completes all pre-investment activities and enters the funded portfolio (at N2).
Having made this assumption about investment timing, we can calculate the average total portfolio
investment by multiplying the average number of funded ventures at each node (or ‘‘to-be-funded’’ ventures, in the case of N1) by the average amount invested in each one. This leads to an expression for the size
of the investment portfolio (in dollars). Formally,

The portfolioÕs average gross income is the annual revenue from successful venture exits less the costs of

Gross Inc: ¼ kp½lfrRðpÞ  I  Jnf :

ð3Þ

If the venture portfolio is proﬁtable on average, then this expression will of course be positive; we shall
assume this to be true in our later analysis.
We divide this gross income by the size of the investment portfolio and then subtract the performance
bonus and the management fee to get investorÕs ROI.

The behaviour of ROI with respect to changes in business conditions (i.e., individual parameters) is
mostly straightforward; Table 1 lists a summary of sensitivity results for this and other ﬁnancial expressions
that we derive later. For example, we can see that ROI will increase if the VCs become more eﬃcient at preinvestment activities (i.e., if a increases) but it will decrease if more venture proposals are submitted (i.e., if k
increases).
4.1.3. Maximization of returns
More interesting is the question of how investors will want the VC process to be managed so as to
maximise their ROI. In other words, from their point of view what is the best allocation of attention t and
acceptance proportion p?
Maximisation of investor’s ROI with respect to attention allocation t: ROI is quasi-concave in t, so there
exists a unique optimal allocation of VC attention to post-investment activities tinv such that

ð5Þ

Maximisation of investor’s ROI with respect to acceptance proportion p: ROI is decreasing in p, so
investors would prefer to have as small a proportion of ventures accepted as possible, i.e. pinv ! 0.
Since the VC employees have only a ﬁxed amount of attention (time, energy, etc.) to provide, the
investorÕs ROI can be maximised primarily by choosing the best allocation of attention between preinvestment activities (at N1, via variable s) and post-investment activities (at N3, via variable t). Recall that
since s ¼ ð1  tÞ, by determining the best value of t we implicitly determine the corresponding value for s.
The ﬁrst result above shows that investors would like to see a ‘‘balanced’’ allocation of attention by the VCs
between pre- and post-investment activities. This moderate approach allows for the fastest possible ﬂow of
ventures through the process, thus reducing the amount of capital tied-up in the investment pool at any one
time. The second result indicates that investors would prefer to have only the highest quality ventures to
invest in; our model implicitly assumes that investors are free to put their money elsewhere if desired, so
they have no incentive to settle for anything but ‘‘the very best’’.

4.2. Management
By management, we mean the senior members of the ﬁrm who would share any residual proﬁts. If the
VC ﬁrm is structured as a partnership, then these would be the partners of the ﬁrm; in a corporate setting,
these could instead include major shareholders and any senior managers who receive a signiﬁcant portion
of their remuneration through proﬁt sharing or stock options. We assume that management is interested in
maximising the ﬁrmÕs annual earnings; this consists of the management fee plus the performance bonus,
minus the overhead costs G and the salaries H of the VC employees as well as their commission from the
performance bonus. This gives the following expression.

As with the investors, we are interested in knowing managementÕs view of an ‘‘optimal’’ VC process, i.e.,
one that would maximise their own gains.
Maximisation of manager’s Earnings with respect to attention allocation t: the behaviour of Earnings
depends on the relative size of management fees versus performance bonuses.
(a) If z > kðx  yÞ i.e. management fees are greater than performance bonuses on average, then Earnings will
be convex in t, with the worst possible value being t ¼ tinv as this would minimise Earnings. Instead management would prefer to have t either as low as possible or as high as possible, i.e. either tmgr:lo ! ða  kÞ=a
or tmgr:hi ! minfkpf =b; 1g.
(b) If z < kðx  yÞ i.e. management fees are smaller than performance bonuses on average, then Earnings will
be concave in t, with a unique maximum tmgr:bonus ¼ tinv .
Maximisation of manager’s Earnings with respect to acceptance proportion p:
(a) Earnings from management fees are convex and increasing in p, which would encourage managers to accept as large a proportion of ventures as possible.
(b) Earnings from performance bonuses are concave in p, which would encourage managers to seek some ‘‘balanced’’ proportion of ventures to accept, i.e. pmgr:bonus ¼ p:

(c) The behaviour of Earnings overall will depend on the relative extent to which the ﬁrm’s revenue is composed
of management fees rather than performance bonuses, and on the relative availability of high quality ventures that is reﬂected in the slope of RðpÞ. The acceptance proportion pmgr that would be optimal overall for
managers would be at least as great as pmgr:bonus .
These results are driven by the trade-oﬀ implied by the two forms of revenue that management receives.
A high acceptance rate coupled with fast pre-investment service will provide a large pool of investments
upon which to charge management fees; on the other hand, a moderate acceptance rate and a balanced
allocation of attention will provide a faster ﬂow of successful exits and thereby earn the ﬁrm higher performance bonuses.
4.3. Employees
By employees, we mean the venture capitalists who actually deal with ventures during the pre- and postinvestment activities but who would typically not share in any residual proﬁts of the ﬁrm. If the ﬁrm is
structured as a partnership, then these would be the associates of the ﬁrm (i.e., the professional workers
who had not yet been admitted into the partnership). We assume that the employees as a group are
interested in maximising their annual Pay, which is a mixture of ﬁxed salaries and beneﬁts plus the variable
commissions taken from the ﬁrmÕs performance bonus. This leads to the following expression.

The second result reﬂects a trade-oﬀ for the employee: accepting more ventures leads to more eventual
exits and so more commission checks; but accepting fewer ventures means the venture quality is higher and
so the average commission check is larger. The optimal acceptance proportion provides a balance between
these two inﬂuences.
4.4. Entrepreneurs
We assume that the objective of the entrepreneur is to take the venture to a successful exit as quickly as
possible, for both ﬁnancial and personal reasons. The entrepreneur will likely seek a short wait because they
are motivated to ‘‘launch their dream’’ and for it to reach it full potential. For example, Cova and Svanfeldt
(1993) propose that entrepreneurs ‘‘. . . create a product that ﬂows from their own internal desires and
needs. They create primarily to express subjective conceptions of beauty, emotion, or some aesthetic ideal.’’
(p. 297).
On the ﬁnancial side, an entrepreneur will presumably want to maximise return on equity (ROE), which
is a function of the amount of the entrepreneurÕs equity stake, the capital revenue eventually obtained, and
the time (or wait) in years from when the investment is made until when the revenue is received. Thus

1=W
Revenue
ROE ¼
 1:
ð11Þ
Equity
The W th root takes account of compounding interest (i.e., the time value of money); e.g., if the venture
takes two years to complete, we calculate the square root of the term in square brackets above to get the %
rate of annual return. As previously mentioned, in our model an entrepreneur receives her capital revenue
(either in cash or marketable shares) at the same time as the VC exits, in amount ð1  rÞRðpÞ. We also
assume that the entrepreneurÕs equity investment in the venture, in terms of both ﬁnancial equity and
‘‘sweat equity’’, either remains the same or increases if the VC process drags on in time. Thus to maximise
ROE the entrepreneur needs to minimise the waiting time from when the entrepreneur ﬁrst applies for
funding until the venture successfully exits.
The entrepreneurÕs average total wait W is the sum of the waits at each node, each times the frequency
that this node is visited; i.e. W ¼ W1 þ fW2 þ fW3 . Therefore,
W ¼

The following results show how entrepreneurs could be expected to view the operation of the VC
process.
Minimisation of the entrepreneur’s wait W with respect to attention allocation t:W is convex with respect to
t, so there is a unique optimal allocation of attention tent to post-investment activities such that

:

ð13Þ

Furthermore this preferred allocation is less than that preferred by the investors, i.e. tent < tinv .
The entrepreneur would prefer somewhat less attention to companies already in the portfolio, and more
attention on the initial screening process. This is because the entrepreneur has to endure the full delay

<-----Page 11----->556

D.A. Shepherd et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 163 (2005) 545–564

during screening, while the investor is less concerned; the investor has not taken a stake in the venture yet,
but the entrepreneur has.
The above results assume we take the point of view of an entrepreneur at the beginning of the process,
that is, one who has not yet received funding. Once ventures get past the screening stage (N1) and into the
portfolio, then those entrepreneurs would naturally prefer t ¼ 1 (i.e., 100% of VC attention focussed on
ventures in the portfolio) because they do not care about any other venture proposals which apply afterwards. In fact they would prefer less competition for VC attention. For similar reasons we do not consider
an entrepreneurÕs preference for acceptance proportion p; in principle, an entrepreneur would want p ¼ 1
for their own venture and p ¼ 0 for all others, so that no other ventures would enter the portfolio and
compete for the VCÕs attention.

5. Comparison of preferences
In the previous section, we determined how each of the various entities involved in the VC process would
view decisions about allocation of attention (i.e., the best value for t) and acceptance control for venture
proposals (i.e., the best value of p). In this section, we compare the extent to which they could be expected
to agree or disagree with each other.
5.1. The allocation of VC attention
Let us consider ﬁrst the allocation of VC attention (as described by t) between pre- and post-investment
activities. In the previous section we found that both investors and employees would prefer to see a
‘‘balanced’’ allocation of attention tinv ¼ temp that would lead to fewer delays in the ﬂow of ventures through
the portfolio (from investment to harvest). In contrast entrepreneurs could be expected to prefer somewhat
less attention on post-investment activities and more on pre-investment, since they would be more concerned about the total time until harvest (i.e., they worry more about initial delays during screening).
ManagementÕs preferences are less consistent, as they largely depend on the relative balance
between management fees and performance bonuses that they receive. We can summarise these views as
follows.
Relative preferences for allocation of VC attention to post-investment activities (as opposed to preinvestment activities): for a given VC process, investors and employees share the same preferences for allocation, and both would prefer a higher allocation than would entrepreneurs. Managers whose earnings consist
mostly of performance bonuses would prefer the same allocation as investors, but those who rely mostly on
management fees will prefer either a much lower allocation or a much higher allocation than any of the other
parties. Thus we have
tmgr:lo < tent < temp ¼ tinv ¼ tmgr:bonus < tmgr:hi :

ð14Þ

Therefore, we could expect investors, entrepreneurs and managers to have diverging opinions on what
constitutes ‘‘best practice’’ for allocation of attention in the VC process. The strength of this disagreement
will of course vary depending on the particular business situation; one aspect of this is illustrated in Table 2.
For example, an increase in management fee percentage z paid to the ﬁrm will cause managers to become
more strongly opposed to allocating attention according to tinv (since they would have even more to gain if
they could increase the portfolio size) and thus increase investor-management tensions. On the other hand,
an increase in exit bonuses x paid to the ﬁrm will cause the investors to become less concerned about using
allocation tinv (a higher bonus means less revenue leftover for them, so less to be concerned about) and so
reduce tensions.

preference is independent of that parameter. Note: for parameters not shown, there is also no eﬀect.

We can also refer back to Table 1 in this regard. For example, an increase in either the overall revenue
function Rð
Þ (i.e. such that exit revenues are higher for all values of acceptance proportion p) or the
probability of successful exit l would lead to improvements in everyoneÕs ﬁnances.
5.2. The proportion of venture proposals to accept for funding
We showed that for the employees there is an optimal proportion of proposals to accept pemp which gives
the best balance between accepting too many and too few proposals. In contrast to this, we found that
investors would prefer to accept only the best ventures for funding so that their money could earn the
highest possible return, but that managers would typically like to accept a large proportion of proposals so
as to create a large portfolio upon which to charge management fees. The following result summarises the
relative preferences of these diﬀerent groups.
Relative preferences for venture proposal acceptance a.k.a. ‘‘quality control standards’’: for a given VC
process, investors would prefer a lower venture acceptance proportion than would employees, and employees
would prefer a lower proportion than would managers. Thus we have
pinv < pemp < pmgr :

ð15Þ

Above we look at the diﬀerent parties involved in the VC process to determine their underlying preferences; one might think of these as the opening oﬀers that each party would be inclined to make at the
beginning of negotiations over how the fund should run. Any ﬁnal agreement amongst the parties must
necessarily be a compromise of these diﬀerent (and sometimes opposing) preferences; for example, management clearly cannot expect to get everything it wants, as there would then be no motivation for investors
to invest in the fund or for VC employees to work for the ﬁrm. One of the important implications of this
model is to point out that these parties may rationally disagree on the operation of the process, sometimes
in ways that are not obvious.

6. Discussion
6.1. Summary of results
In this article we examined the venture capital process by which new ventures obtain investor funding via
venture capital ﬁrms. To do this, we constructed a simple Jackson queuing network with two key management parameters: the allocation of VC attention between pre- and post-investment involvement with the
ventures; and the proportion of venture proposals that would be accepted for funding. Using this queuing
network along with a number of simple assumptions concerning the ﬁnancial aspects of the VC process, we
developed a set of expressions to describe the ﬁnancial performance of the process. These expressions allowed us to consider how to best manage the VC process in order to optimise the process overall from the
diﬀering viewpoints of entrepreneurs, investors, VC ﬁrm managers, and VC workers. Our sensitivity
analysis showed (in Tables 1 and 2) how these ‘‘best practice’’ results would be aﬀected by changes in the
business environment. More interestingly, our comparative analysis showed how the diﬀerent parties could
rationally be expected to disagree in several respects over what would in fact constitute ‘‘best practice’’.
With regards to the allocation of VC attention between pre- and post-investment activities, we found that
while investors would typically support a ‘‘balanced’’ allocation that would also be in the best interests of
the process overall, the managers of the VC ﬁrm would likely be diametrically opposed to this allocation.
With regards to the acceptance of proposed ventures to fund, we found that each of these groups would
have a diﬀerent view of how selective the process ought to be.
Overall this paperÕs comparative results suggest that there may be signiﬁcant potential for disagreements
about the proper operation of the VC process, as each entity tries to maximise its own rewards at the
possible expense of each other and of the ‘‘greater good’’. We should point out here that we are not
claiming that any of these three groups will always focus solely on its own performance objective and
completely disregard the needs of the other groups. For example, managers would recognise that investors
must receive an ‘‘adequate’’ ROI, otherwise they would stop investing, and employees know that the VC
ﬁrm has to be proﬁtable enough to survive in order for them to retain their jobs; thus there would inevitably
be at least some willingness to negotiate and compromise on decisions about attention allocation and
acceptance proportion. What we do think our results show is how the motivation and initial bargaining
positions for each group would rationally diﬀer during any such negotiations.
6.2. Limitations
In our ﬁnancial modelling, for each of the parties involved we deliberately chose a single ﬁnancial
measure (out of many possible ones) to represent that groupÕs motivation. Our modelÕs results therefore
could be criticised as being mere artefacts of the particular choices we made. We would reply that although
our choices of measures are to some extent arbitrary, they are nonetheless reasonable and are at least
representative of the way these parties actually evaluate performance. Thus we believe that while our
conclusions may not be deﬁnitive, they would at least be indicative of actual behaviour.
To keep the model tractable and relatively easy-to-follow, we have ignored some of the higher-order
interdependencies amongst parameters. For example, while our revenue function R does take into account
the selectivity of the VC ﬁrm in accepting proposals, it does not directly consider the time lag between the
moment of investment and the moment of successful exit, or the amount invested in any particular venture.
We would argue that this sort of simpliﬁcation is a necessary feature of modelling work (one cannot include
everything) and that we have included the most important relationships; thus we believe that our model
simpliﬁcation does not detract from the value of the analysis.
We also note that there are several technical assumptions inherent in our queuing model that we have
made in order to keep the mathematics relatively simple. For example, we have assumed that the work done

<-----Page 14----->D.A. Shepherd et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 163 (2005) 545–564

559

by the VCs with the ventures can be appropriately represented by single server Markovian queues; while
these are rarely exact representations of reality, they are often approximately correct and are a standard assumption in the absence of detailed data (see for example Cooper (1990) or Papadopoulos et al.
(1993)).

7. Conclusion
There are a number of tasks that venture capitalists must perform well within the venture capital process
in order to maximise the proﬁtability of the process. In this article we have proposed a simple model of the
venture capital process that gives us some insight as to how the process might best be managed and why
there may be disagreements about what ‘‘best’’ actually means. Each factor that requires consideration in
our model is readily operationalised and therefore the model proposed here can (and hopefully will) provide
a basis for empirical testing.
Our work complements previous studies which have tended to concentrate more on what VCs do at each
stage of the process (thus describing the elements of current practices), rather than on how these stages ﬁt
together and should best be managed (thus suggesting the development of better practices). These
descriptive studies have made a substantial contribution to the literature, but we believe that more research
is required into the means of improving the performance of the venture capital process. We believe that we
have taken a small but important step in this direction and hope that other scholars will also focus on
improving (over and above describing) the VC process.

Appendix A. Mathematical derivations
A.1. Flow of ventures through the system
Derivation of the average rate of venture ﬂow through each arc of the network is mostly a straightforward process; begin with rate k of new proposals arriving at N1 and proceed from left to right through
the network. For the ‘‘feedback loop’’ between N2 and N3 the ﬂows are derived by simultaneous solution
of 2 ﬂow balance equations:
Flow2!3 ¼ kp þ Flow3!2

and

Flow3!2 ¼ n Flow2!3 :

The solutions of these ﬂows are shown along with the ﬂows on the other arcs in Fig. 1.

A.2. System steady state
We model nodes N1 and N3 as M/M/1 queues; thus we implicitly assume that the group of VCs working
at each node can reasonably be represented as a single server, and that the times between arrivals and the
times for service both follow exponential distributions. Given these assumptions, the expected number
of ventures at each node i (either being helped or awaiting service) is calculated as
Vi ¼ ðarrival rateÞ=½ðservice rateÞ  ðarrival rateÞ. Node N2 is modelled as an M/M/1 queue (hence no
line-ups and no waiting), so the expected number of ventures at that node undergoing development is
simply V2 ¼ (arrival rate)(average stay).

which is always positive; hence the wait must be convex in t, with a unique minimum at tent . The relation
between the size of tinv and tent is shown by comparing Eq. (A.11) to (A.1) for investors and noting that
ðIÞ < ðI þ Jnf Þ; thus the value of t that makes (A.1) equal zero will instead make (A.11) positive.

A.7. Results for comparing preferences
The ordering of acceptance probability preferences follows from a comparison of the various derivatives
with respect to p. From Eq. (A.6), we see that earnings from bonuses are optimised at some point
pmgr:bonus ¼ p:

Comparing this to equation (A.9) we can see that this same relation identiﬁes the optimal acceptance
proportion pemp , so we have pmgr:bonus ¼ pemp . Since we know that managementÕs optimal value
pmgr > pmgr:bonus , then it follows as well that pmgr > pemp . Conversely, o ROI=op is negative for all p, including
at pemp ; thus investors would prefer a value of p less than pemp .
The ordering of post-investment attention allocation preferences likewise follows from a comparison of
the respective derivatives with respect to t.

A.8. Results for tables
The sensitivity results in Table 1 are obtained by examining the sign of the derivative of each ﬁnancial
equation with respect to that parameter. For example, to ﬁnd the eﬀect of a change in the proposal arrival
rate k on ROI (Eq. (4)), take the derivative

Since this is negative (at least so long as the VC process is proﬁtable with a positive net income), ROI must
be decreasing in k. The other listed results are obtained in similar manner, starting with Eqs. (4), (7), (9) or
(12) as appropriate. For the eﬀect of changes in revenue function RðpÞ, we take derivatives with respect to R
as if it were a parameter rather than a function; i.e. as if RðpÞ were increasing by the same percentage for all
p.
For Table 2 we work with Eqs. (A.1) and (A.4) and focus on the case where managersÕ earnings consist
more of management fees than of performance bonuses, thus z > kðx  yÞ. Note that in both cases the
location of the extreme point tinv (maximum ROI, minimum Earnings) is determined by the expression

When this equals zero, the derivatives are zero. When this is not zero, then the magnitude of each derivative
(i.e. the marginal cost or marginal beneﬁt of not using tinv ) is determined by the magnitude (either negative
or positive) of the ‘‘multiplier’’ ½z  kðx  yÞkp for o Earnings=ot and

for o ROI=ot. The results in Table 2 are obtained by taking the partial derivative of each multiplier with
respect to each parameter. For example, an increase in p causes investors to have a stronger preference for
using tinv , since of½z  kðx  yÞkpg=op ¼ ½z  kðx  yÞk > 0. Conversely for managers we have
