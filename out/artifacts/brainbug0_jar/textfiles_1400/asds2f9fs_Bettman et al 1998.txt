Consumer decision making has been a focal interest in consumer research, and
consideration of current marketplace trends (e.g., technological change, an information explosion) indicates that this topic will continue to be critically important.
We argue that consumer choice is inherently constructive. Due to limited processing capacity, consumers often do not have well-defined existing preferences,
but construct them using a variety of strategies contingent on task demands.
After describing constructive choice, consumer decision tasks, and decision strategies, we provide an integrative framework for understanding constructive choice,
review evidence for constructive consumer choice in light of that framework, and
identify knowledge gaps that suggest opportunities for additional research.

C

onsumer choices concerning the selection, consumption, and disposal of products and services can often
be difficult and are important to the consumer, to marketers, and to policy makers. As a result, the study of consumer decision processes has been a focal interest in consumer behavior for over 30 years (e.g., Bettman 1979;
Hansen 1972; Howard and Sheth 1969; Nicosia 1966).
One can infer from recent trends in the nature and structure of the marketplace that the importance of understanding consumer decision making is likely to continue. Rapid
technological change, for instance, has led to multitudes
of new products and decreased product lifetimes. In addition, new communications media such as the World Wide
Web have made enormous amounts of information on
options potentially available (Alba et al. 1997). Further,
consumers are often asked to make difficult value tradeoffs, such as price versus safety in purchasing an automobile, environmental protection versus convenience in a
variety of goods, and quality of life versus longevity in
complex health care decisions.
How do consumers cope with the decisions they must
make, some of which involve difficult trade-offs and uncertainties? One approach to studying consumer decisions
has been to assume a rational decision maker with well-

defined preferences that do not depend on particular descriptions of the options or on the specific methods used
to elicit those preferences. Each option in a choice set is
assumed to have a utility, or subjective value, that depends only on the option. Finally, it is assumed that the
consumer has ability or skill in computation that enables
the calculation of which option will maximize his or her
received value and selects accordingly. This approach to
studying consumer decisions, often attributed to economists and called rational choice theory, has contributed
greatly to the prediction of consumer decisions.
Over the past twenty-five years, an alternative, information-processing approach to the study of consumer
choice (e.g., Bettman 1979) has argued that rational
choice theory is incomplete and/or flawed as an approach
for understanding how consumers actually make decisions. The information-processing approach endorses
bounded rationality (Simon 1955), the notion that decision makers have limitations on their capacity for processing information. Such limitations include limited
working memory and limited computational capabilities.
In addition, decision makers are characterized by perceptions attuned to changes rather than absolute magnitudes
and diminishing sensitivity to changes to stimuli (Tversky
and Kahneman 1991). More generally, behavior is shaped
by the interaction between the properties of the human
information-processing system and the properties of task
environments (Simon 1990).1

For a recent comparison of these alternative perspectives on decision
making, see McFadden (1997). As McFadden notes, economists vary
in terms of the degree to which they believe rational choice theory
describes actual decision behavior. A middle ground adopted by some
economists is that individuals have a consistent set of preferences but
that such preferences become known by the individual (are ‘‘discov-

The notions of bounded rationality and limited processing capacity are consistent with the growing belief
among decision researchers that preferences for options
of any complexity or novelty are often constructed, not
merely revealed, in making a decision (Bettman 1979;
Bettman and Park 1980; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson
1992; Slovic 1995; Tversky, Sattath, and Slovic 1988).
People often do not have well-defined preferences; instead, they may construct them on the spot when needed,
such as when they must make a choice. Thus, consumer
preference formation may be more like architecture,
building some defensible set of values, rather than like
archaeology, uncovering values that are already there
(Gregory, Lichtenstein, and Slovic 1993).
The idea of constructive preferences denies that individuals simply refer to a master list of preferences in
memory when making a choice and also asserts that preferences are not necessarily generated by applying some
invariant algorithm such as a weighted adding model
(Tversky et al. 1988). Rather than one invariant approach
to solving choice problems, consumers appear to utilize
a wide variety of approaches, often developed on the spot.
Consumers may also develop problem representations on
the spot by structuring or restructuring the available information (Coupey 1994). One important property of this
constructive viewpoint is that preferences will often be
highly context dependent. In addition, because decision
approaches are developed on the fly, processing will be
highly sensitive to the local problem structure. This implies that processing approaches may change as consumers learn more about problem structure during the course
of making a decision.
Why are preferences constructive? One reason individuals may construct preferences is that they lack the cognitive resources to generate well-defined preferences for
many situations (March 1978). A second important reason is that consumers often bring multiple goals to a given
decision problem.
Preferences are not always constructed; people do have
firm and stable preferences for some objects. For example,
the first author has a well-defined and highly positive
value for chocolate. In such cases, consumers may simply
retrieve these previously formed evaluations from memory and select the option with the highest evaluation (i.e.,
affect referral [Wright 1975]).
People are most likely to have well-articulated preferences when they are familiar and experienced with the
preference object, and rational choice theory may be most
applicable in such situations. Even in such cases, however, situational factors may intrude; although a consumer
has a strong preference for chocolate, he or she may
ered’’) only through thought and experience (Plott 1996). In a similar
vein, Lucas (1986, p. S402) has argued that economists tend ‘‘to focus
on situations in which the agent can be expected to ‘know’ or to have
learned the consequences of different actions so that his observed
choices reveal stable features of his underlying preferences.’’

sometimes order another dessert. The probability that
prior preferences will be retrieved from memory and used
will depend on their relative accessibility and diagnosticity, among other factors (Feldman and Lynch 1988).
Also, preferences may be more constructive to the degree
that the decision problem is complex or stressful.
As noted above, an important implication of the constructive nature of preferences (and evidence for such
construction) is that choices often are highly contingent
on a variety of factors characterizing decision problems,
individuals, and the social context. For example, the following are some of the major conclusions from research
on consumer decision making: (1) Choice among options
depends critically on the goals of the decision maker. The
option that is selected will depend on the extent to which
the consumer’s goals are minimizing the cognitive effort
required for making a choice, maximizing the accuracy
of the decision, minimizing the experience of negative
emotion during decision making, maximizing the ease of
justifying the decision, or some combination of such
goals. (2) Choice among options depends on the complexity of the decision task. Options that are superior on
the most prominent attribute are favored as the task becomes more complex because the use of simple decision
processes increases with task complexity. (3) Choice
among options is context dependent. The relative value
of an option depends not only on characteristics of that
option but also on the characteristics of other options in
the choice set. (4) Choice among options depends on
how one is asked; strategically equivalent methods for
eliciting preferences can lead to systematically different
decisions. (5) Choice among options depends on how the
choice set is represented (framed) or displayed, even
when the representations would be regarded as equivalent
by the decision maker on reflection. A key issue in framing is whether the outcomes are represented as gains or
losses, with losses impacting decisions more than corresponding gains.
Thus, constructive processing generally implies contingent choices. However, the fact that a choice is contingent
need not imply that the processing was constructive, that
is, developed on the spot. For example, a consumer may
have a well-established, but contingent, preference for hot
chocolate on a cold day and a cold soda on a warm day;
such a preference is not constructive.
The constructive view of consumer decision making
raises fundamental theoretical issues. It is clearly not sufficient to respond ‘‘it depends’’ when asked to describe
consumer choices. A major purpose of this article, therefore, is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding constructive consumer choice. This framework then
allows us to accomplish the two other major goals of the
article: (1) reviewing consumer decision research with
the framework serving as an organizing device, and (2)
using this review to find gaps in our knowledge that suggest new research directions. The remainder of the article
is structured as follows: We begin with a discussion of

CONSUMER DECISION TASKS AND
DECISION STRATEGIES
Decision Tasks and the Consumer
Information Environment
A typical consumer choice, such as the simplified automobile choice task illustrated in Table 1, involves a set
of alternatives, each described by some attributes or consequences. The set of alternatives can vary in size from
one choice to the next, with some choices involving as
few as two options and others potentially involving many
more (in some cases the two options may be simply to
either accept or reject an alternative). The attributes may
vary in their potential consequences, their desirability to
the consumer, and the consumer’s willingness to trade
off less of one attribute for more of another. For example,
a consumer may be fairly certain about the values of some
of the attributes (e.g., horsepower) but more uncertain
about others (e.g., reliability). The consumer may not
have information for all of the options on some attributes
(e.g., reliability information would not be available for a
new model). In addition, some attributes, such as safety,
may be difficult for consumers to trade off; making tradeoffs requires possibly accepting a loss on such an attribute, with potentially threatening consequences. Finally,
some choices may not correspond to the above example,
in which all options are from the same product category.
Individuals can be faced with choices in which the attributes defining the options may differ, such as deciding
whether to spend money on a vacation or on a new stereo.
Such choices have been called noncomparable (Bettman
and Sujan 1987; Johnson 1984). The difficulty of the
choice problem faced by the consumer will increase with
more options and attributes, with increased uncertainty

about the values of the attributes, if there are more attributes that are difficult to trade off, and if the number of
shared attributes is smaller, among other factors.
We have presented some general properties of consumer decision tasks above. One of the most important
findings from prior consumer research is that the same
individual may use a variety of different strategies when
making decisions. A great deal of research has focused
on characterizing such strategies, their properties, and the
factors influencing their usage. In the next section we
provide a brief overview of consumer decision strategies
and their properties. We examine the determinants of
strategy use in a later section.

Consumer Decision Strategies
Characteristics of Decision Strategies. We begin by
considering four primary aspects that characterize choice
strategies: the total amount of information processed, the
selectivity in information processing, the pattern of processing (whether by alternative [brand] or by attribute),
and whether the strategy is compensatory or noncompensatory.
First, the amount of information processed can vary a
great deal. For example, an automobile choice may involve detailed consideration of much of the information
available about each of the available cars, as implied by
most rational choice models, or it may entail only a cursory consideration of a limited set of information (e.g.,
repeating what one chose last time).
Second, different amounts of information can be processed for each attribute or alternative (selective processing), or the same amount of information can be processed for each attribute or alternative (consistent
processing). For example, suppose a consumer considering the cars in Table 1 decided that safety was the most
important attribute, processed only that attribute, and
chose car D, with the best value on that attribute. This
choice process would involve highly selective processing
of attribute information (since the amount of information
examined differs across attributes) but consistent processing of alternative brand information (since one piece
of information is considered for each car). The fact that
working memory capacity is limited effectively requires
selective attention to information. In general, the more
selective consumers are in processing information, the
more susceptible their decisions may be to factors that
influence the salience of information, some of which may
be irrelevant.
Third, information may be processed primarily by alternative, in which multiple attributes of a single option
are processed before another option is considered, or by
attribute, in which the values of several alternatives on a
single attribute are examined before information on another attribute is considered. For example, a consumer
might engage in attribute processing by examining the
price of each of the five cars, concluding that car B was

cresas

<-----Page 4----->JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

190

the most expensive, car A was the least expensive, and
that car C had a very good price. However, the consumer
could process in an alternative-based fashion by examining the reliability, price, safety, and horsepower of car A
in order to form an overall valuation of that car. Many
standard models of decision making (e.g., weighted adding) assume alternative-based processing, although attribute-based processing is often easier (Tversky 1972).
Finally, an important distinction among strategies is the
degree to which they are compensatory. A compensatory
strategy is one in which a good value on one attribute can
compensate for a poor value on another. A compensatory
strategy thus requires explicit trade-offs among attributes.
Deciding how much more one is willing to pay for very
good rather than average reliability in a car involves making an explicit trade-off between reliability and price, for
example. Frisch and Clemen (1994), among others, have
argued that making trade-offs is an important aspect of
high quality, rational decision making. In a noncompensatory strategy, a good value on one attribute cannot make
up for a poor value on another. If a consumer decides to
choose the safest car, then car D will be chosen regardless
of its high price and regardless of the high ratings for car
B on reliability or car E for horsepower.
Specific Decision Strategies. There are many different decision strategies, and these strategies can be characterized by the above aspects of choice processing. One
classic decision strategy is the weighted adding strategy.
Assume that the consumer can assess the importance of
each attribute and assign a subjective value to each possible attribute level. Then the weighted adding strategy
consists of considering one alternative at a time, examining each of the attributes for that option, multiplying each
attribute’s subjective value times its importance weight
(e.g., multiplying the subjective value of average reliability in a car times the importance of a car’s reliability),
and summing these products across all of the attributes
to obtain an overall value for each option. Then the alternative with the highest value would be chosen. Weighted
adding is therefore characterized by extensive, consistent
(not selective), alternative-based, and compensatory processing. Because weighted adding is extensive, compensatory, and involves explicit trade-offs, it is often considered to be more normatively accurate than heuristics that
do not possess these characteristics (Frisch and Clemen
1994). Weighted adding, however, potentially places
great demands on consumers’ working memory and computational capabilities. Nevertheless, weighted adding is
the decision model that underlies many of the techniques
used by market researchers to assess preferences.
The lexicographic strategy provides a good contrast to
weighted adding: the alternative with the best value on
the most important attribute is simply selected (assuming
that there are no ties on this attribute). If a consumer
believed that reliability was the most important attribute
for cars, he or she could use a lexicographic strategy,

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

examine reliability (and no other information) for all five
cars, and choose car B. The lexicographic strategy involves limited, attribute-based, noncompensatory processing that is selective across attributes and consistent
across alternatives.
Satisficing is a classic strategy in the decision-making
literature (Simon 1955). Alternatives are considered sequentially, in the order in which they occur in the choice
set. The value of each attribute for the option currently
under consideration is considered to see whether it meets
a predetermined cutoff level for that attribute. If any attribute fails to meet the cutoff level, processing is terminated
for that option, the option is rejected, and the next option
is considered. For example, car A might be eliminated
very rapidly because it has the worst level of reliability.
The first option that passes the cutoffs for all attributes
is selected. If no option passes all the cutoffs, the levels
can be relaxed and the process repeated. One implication
of satisficing is that which option is chosen can be a
function of the order in which the options are processed.
The satisficing strategy is alternative based, selective, and
noncompensatory. The extent of processing will vary depending on the exact values of the cutoffs and attribute
levels.
Elimination-by-aspects (EBA) combines elements of
both the lexicographic and satisficing strategies. Elimination-by-aspects eliminates options that do not meet a minimum cutoff value for the most important attribute. This
elimination process is repeated for the second most important attribute, with processing continuing until a single
option remains (Tversky 1972). In our car example, suppose that the consumer’s two most important attributes
were reliability and safety, in that order, and that the
cutoff for each was an average value. This consumer
would first process reliability, eliminating any car with a
below-average value (cars A, C, and E). Then the consumer would consider safety for cars B and D, eliminating
car B. Hence, car D would be selected. Elimination-byaspects is attribute based, noncompensatory, and the extensiveness and selectivity of processing will vary depending on the exact pattern of elimination of options.
The equal weight strategy, a variation on weighted adding, considers all of the alternatives and all of the attribute
values for each alternative. However, processing is simplified by ignoring information about attribute weights.
A value is obtained for each alternative by summing all
of the attribute values for that option, and the alternative
with the highest value is selected. The equal weight strategy is thus a special case of weighted adding if unit
weights are assumed. The equal weight strategy has often
been advocated as a highly accurate simplification
(Dawes 1979). Processing is extensive, consistent, alternative based, and compensatory.
The majority of confirming dimensions strategy was
first described by Russo and Dosher (1983). Alternatives
are processed in pairs, with the values of the two alternatives compared on each attribute, and the alternative with

cresas

UC: Con Res

<-----Page 5----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

a majority of winning (better) attribute values is retained.
The retained option is then compared to the next alternative from the choice set, and this process of pairwise
comparison continues until all the alternatives have been
evaluated and one option remains. This strategy is a simplified case of a more general model of choice, additive
difference (see Tversky [1969] for a presentation of the
additive difference model and a discussion of the relationship between additive difference and adding models).
Processing is extensive, consistent, attribute based, and
compensatory.
Alba and Marmorstein (1987) proposed that consumers
may evaluate and choose alternatives using counts of the
number of good or bad features characterizing the alternatives. Consumers develop cutoffs for specifying good and
bad features, and depending on the consumer’s focus (i.e.,
good features, bad features, or both), different versions
of the strategy could be developed. Note that this strategy
can be seen as a voting rule applied to multiattribute
choice, where each attribute has one vote. Weber,
Goldstein, and Barlas (1995) provide evidence consistent
with such a strategy, noting that encoding of such outcomes is often simple. For example, whether an outcome
is a gain or a loss may have a larger impact on preferences
than the actual magnitude of the outcome. The amount
and selectivity of processing for this strategy, as well
as whether it is compensatory or noncompensatory, will
depend on the variant of the rule used. Processing is
alternative based for all variants, however.
Consumers also use combinations of strategies. A typical combined strategy has an initial phase in which some
alternatives are eliminated and a second phase where the
remaining options are analyzed in more detail (Payne
1976; see Beach’s [1990] image theory for further analysis of the role of elimination or screening processes in
decision making). One frequently observed strategy combination is an initial use of EBA to reduce the choice set
to two or three options followed by a compensatory strategy such as weighted adding to select from among those
remaining.
The strategies presented thus far have been those most
commonly addressed in consumer research; they range
from weighted adding to more heuristic strategies such
as EBA that process information in a more selective and
noncompensatory fashion. However, recent work utilizing
more perceptual approaches (e.g., Simonson and Tversky
1992) has suggested the use of decision heuristics that
are relational and perceptual in nature. Such heuristics
emphasize the ratings of a given option relative to other
alternatives. For example, one heuristic of this type might
examine dominance relationships among pairs of alternatives and use such information to make a choice (e.g., the
choice of an asymmetrically dominating option; Huber,
Payne, and Puto 1982). Another exemplar might assess
relative trade-offs between pairs of options on pairs of
attributes, compare these trade-off rates, and use these
comparisons as inputs to a choice (e.g., trade-off contrast;

Simonson and Tversky 1992). Finally, a consumer might
compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of an
option to those of other options (e.g., compromise effects;
Simonson and Tversky 1992). For other work on relational heuristics, see Drolet (1997).
Tversky and Simonson (1993) propose a model called
the componential context model that includes these types
of relational heuristics as special cases. In specific, they
define

where VB (x, S) is the value of option x given a choice set
S and background context B, bi is the weight of attribute i,
£i (xi ) is the utility of the value xi of option x on attribute
i, R(x, y) is the relative advantage of option x over option
y, and u is the weight given to the relative advantage
component of the model. The relative advantage term is
obtained by taking utility differences between the two
options on each attribute and combining them. This model
is compensatory, consistent, and has both alternativebased and attribute-based components. It is difficult to
assess the amount of processing for this model; for the
small problems typically used in this research stream
(e.g., three options and two dimensions), the relative
advantage component may be assessed essentially perceptually, with little effort. For larger problems where direct
perceptual assessment may not be feasible, the amount of
processing could be extensive, although simpler versions
could certainly be specified (e.g., only examine the relative advantage term for the two attributes with the largest
weights). We will return to issues in specifying the processes implied by this model. For another model of relative advantage combining absolute and comparative components, see Shafir, Osherson, and Smith (1989, 1993).

ences about the types of strategies consumers use by observing such characteristics as the amount, selectivity,
and degree of alternative-based versus attribute-based
processing.
We have argued above that consumer choices are constructive and have briefly noted some of the major findings from research on consumer decision making. In the
next section we attempt to provide an integrated framework that can explain such contingent choice patterns.

AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR
CONSTRUCTIVE CHOICE PROCESSES
Payne (1982) reviewed two major frameworks for understanding contingent choice: a cost-benefit (accuracyeffort) approach and a perceptual approach. The basic
premise of the accuracy-effort approach is that each decision strategy can be characterized by its accuracy and the
effort it requires in any given situation. Decision makers
select strategies in a situation based on some compromise
between the desire to make an accurate decision and the
desire to minimize cognitive effort. Since the accuracy
and effort characteristics generally differ across strategies
for a given decision environment and across environments
for a given strategy, strategy usage will vary depending
on the properties of the decision task.
The perceptual framework is usually associated with
the work of Tversky and Kahneman; they prefer explanations of constructive decision making based on principles
of human perception. For example, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) argue that our perceptions are attuned to noticing changes rather than absolute magnitudes of stimuli
and that outcomes will naturally be coded as gains and
losses relative to some reference point. They also argue
that different ways of framing a problem may lead to
different choices, much like the effect of taking different
perspectives on perception; that subjects are often unaware of the effects of framing; and such that effects are
likely to persist in the same way that perceptual illusions
persist (Tversky and Kahneman 1981, 1988). Thus, incentives may be less effective for problems involving
perceptual factors than for problems involving accuracyeffort trade-offs. Finally, Simonson and Tversky (1992)
explicitly invoke the analogy to perceptual contrast effects
in motivating their trade-off contrast results.
Although the accuracy-effort and perceptual frameworks, considered separately, can each account for some
findings in constructive choice, we believe that an integrated framework that extends each approach and then
combines the two approaches is both possible and would
be extremely useful. The key to integrating the approaches is to note that the perceptual approach has much
to say about which aspects of a choice task are noticed
and how tasks are represented, and the accuracy-effort
approach is well suited for considering how consumers
utilize the information they notice in order to attain their
goals. Thus, the two approaches complement each other

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

by providing insights into different aspects of the decision
process. In addition to integrating them, each approach
can be extended in important ways. For example, we
propose that the goals considered in the accuracy-effort
approach be augmented by including goals for minimizing
the experience of negative emotion during decision making and for maximizing the ease with which a decision
can be justified. We propose extending the perceptual
approach by considering some perceptual processes as
choice heuristics whose properties and use could be examined in a manner similar to other heuristics. We call our
integrated framework a choice goals framework. In the
next section we outline the general principles of that
framework.

A Choice Goals Framework
In this section we outline the basic postulates of our
framework for understanding constructive decision making.
Similar to Bettman’s (1979) outline for an informationprocessing theory of consumer choice, we consider what
consumers are trying to accomplish (goals), what influences the information they attend to and how it is perceived
or encoded, and what factors affect the heuristics consumers
utilize to combine information and make a decision. For
each topic, we summarize our major conclusions as propositions; these propositions underlying our integrated framework are summarized in Appendix A.
Consumer Goals. Choices are made to achieve goals.
Bettman (1979) instantiated this notion by postulating
that a consumer making a decision has a goal hierarchy,
often developed constructively on the spot, specifying the
goals and subgoals he or she must attain. More recently,
interpretive research on consumer behavior has focused
on what choices and consumer possessions mean to consumers (Belk 1988). Thus, it is critical to characterize a
consumer’s goals for a particular task when trying to
ascertain why his or her choice processes take a certain
form.
A fruitful level of analysis for developing an explanatory framework is to examine consumers’ metagoals for
choice processing. Examples of such metagoals are maximizing the accuracy of a decision, minimizing the cognitive effort required for the decision, minimizing the experience of negative emotion while making the decision, or
maximizing the ease with which a decision can be justified. Note, however, that the usefulness of a choice goal
framework is compromised if too many goals are postulated, such as a different goal for each decision. To gain
explanatory power, we focus on the limited subset of such
goals postulated above and examine the degree to which
such goals can explain observed constructive decision
making.
The selection of these particular goals is not arbitrary;
we believe that as a set they capture many of the most
important motivational aspects relevant to decision mak-

ing. Historically (e.g., in the rational choice approach),
accuracy was the first goal considered; the goal of making
a choice was considered to be maximizing utility. Simon
(1955) and others were instrumental in bringing effortrelated goals to bear on understanding choice in response
to the realization that humans have limited processing
capacity, as discussed above. Computational problems are
not the only factors that make choices difficult, however.
Humans are emotional beings, and choices can involve
wrenching trade-offs. Thus, we believe that the goal of
minimizing experienced negative emotion is important in
some situations. Finally, humans are also social beings,
and one of the most decision-relevant characteristics of
the social context is that decisions are often evaluated,
either by others or by oneself. Hence, the decision maker
often must be able to justify a decision to others or to
himself or herself.
We argue that different subsets of these goals are relevant in different situations. We will specify further some
of the many problem characteristics that influence a decision when various goals are relevant. For example, irreversible decision problems that are very important to oneself or one’s spouse may evoke goals for increased
accuracy, minimizing negative emotion, and increased
ease of justification. The relative weight placed on various
goals will also reflect the individual’s ability to obtain
timely and unambiguous feedback on his or her performance relative to these goals. In general, effort feedback
is much easier to obtain than accuracy feedback. The
individual usually has a very good notion about how hard
he or she is working and thus has timely and unambiguous
feedback on effort, whereas feedback on accuracy is often
delayed and ambiguous (Einhorn 1980). The consumer
also can assess his or her emotional state fairly easily.
Finally, feedback on ease of justification is often immediate but can be ambiguous, since what makes for a good
explanation in a given situation may not be clear. Reasonable justifications may be easier to predict in situations
where the choice task is relatively simple with limited
information, because the options for justification are more
limited. Thus, the ability to obtain timely and relatively
unambiguous feedback on effort and emotion may make
those goals particularly salient in many situations. However, there has not been nearly enough research on the
factors determining the relative salience of goals in choice
situations. We summarize with two propositions:
Proposition 1.1: Consumers make choices in order to
accomplish goals. Four of the most important goals for
consumer decision making are (a) maximizing the accuracy of the choice, (b) minimizing the cognitive effort
required to make the choice, (c) minimizing the experience
of negative emotion when making the choice, and ( d) maximizing the ease of justifying the decision.
Proposition 1.2: The relative weight placed on various
goals will be influenced by a variety of problem characteristics, including the importance and irreversibility of the
decision and the timeliness and ambiguity of the feedback
available on performance relative to each goal.

Attention, Information Selectivity, and Perceptual Interpretation. As noted earlier, the fact that consumers
have limited processing capacity means that they generally cannot process all of the available information in a
particular situation. Hence, selectivity is necessary, and
which information is selected for processing can have a
major impact on choice. Put another way, it is critical to
understand the determinants of the focus of attention,
since many contingent choice effects are brought about
by making salient different aspects of the choice environment.
Based on the psychology of attention, we know that
there are two major types of attention, voluntary and involuntary (Kahneman 1973). Voluntary attention describes when attention is devoted to information that is
perceived to be relevant to current goals (i.e., is labeled
as ‘‘diagnostic’’ in Feldman and Lynch’s [1988] accessibility-diagnosticity framework). Individuals will devote
more effort to examining information they believe will
help them attain whichever goals are more heavily
weighted in that situation.
Attention also may be captured involuntarily by aspects
of the environment that are surprising, novel, unexpected,
potentially threatening, or extremely perceptually salient,
thus exemplifying one aspect of accessibility in the Feldman and Lynch (1988) framework. For example, changes
and losses may be particularly salient (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979), and particular problem representations
may make certain aspects stand out and gain involuntary
attention. Thus, attention and selectivity can be influenced
both by goal-driven and more involuntary perceptual factors (for a similar distinction, see Tversky [1977]).
The effects of goals and perceptual factors can go beyond attention. For example, preexisting goals can lead
to motivated reasoning and distortion of the meaning of
new information (Kunda 1990; Russo, Medvec, and
Meloy 1996). In addition, aspects of the environment
that capture involuntary attention may also set in motion
perceptual interpretations and behavioral responses (e.g.,
interpreting a loud noise as a threat and the corresponding
orienting response). As we discuss further below, we
believe that particularly salient aspects of the choice task
can at times not only capture attention but also suggest
certain types of heuristics. For example, simple problem
displays that make asymmetric dominance visually transparent may make heuristics that are based on relational
properties of the options more accessible and thus more
likely to be used. We believe that the connection of both
goal-driven and more perceptual processes to selectivity
and interpretation is a critical factor enabling a more integrated framework for understanding constructive consumer choice. To summarize:
Proposition 1.3: Two major influences on the selectivity
of attention are current goals (voluntary attention) and
surprising, novel, threatening, unexpected, or otherwise
perceptually salient aspects of the choice environment (in-

194
voluntary attention). Such factors can also affect the perceptual interpretation of focal aspects of the environment.

Choice Heuristics. First, we assume that individuals
have a repertoire of strategies for solving decision problems, perhaps acquired through experience or training.
Different consumers may vary in terms of the strategies
they possess; for example, many children’s processing
deficits may be due to lack of knowledge of appropriate
strategies (John and Whitney 1986; Roedder 1981; Roedder, Sternthal, and Calder 1983).
Second, different strategies vary in their advantages
and disadvantages with respect to accomplishing different
goals in a given situation. That is, different strategies will
be more or less accurate, effortful, emotionally
wrenching, or easy to justify in a given choice environment. For example, the weighted adding strategy may
tend to be accurate, effortful, and potentially more emotionally difficult because it requires making trade-offs,
which may be emotion laden in some situations. It is less
clear how weighted adding would fare in terms of ease
of justification; its thorough processing would aid justification, but the many subjective trade-offs required could
hinder justification. Elimination-by-aspects, on the other
hand, may be easy to explain and defend (Tversky 1972),
avoids emotion-laden trade-offs, and varies in its effort
and accuracy depending on characteristics of the choice
task.
Third, the advantages and disadvantages for a given
strategy will be affected by individual differences in computational skills and expertise in the choice domain, both
of which can affect how easily and accurately a heuristic
can be implemented (Stanovich and West 1998). For
example, the ability to analyze and select the most relevant information improves with expertise (Alba and
Hutchinson 1987; Russo and LeClerc 1994; West, Brown,
and Hoch 1996); with increased expertise a consumer
might be more able to evaluate the safety of a car, for
instance.
Fourth, the relative advantages and disadvantages for
a particular strategy may differ from one environment to
another. For example, a strategy that is more accurate
in one environment may be less accurate in another, or
different information presentation formats may make certain strategies more or less effortful to implement (for a
classic example of such format effects, see Russo
[1977]).
Finally, given the array of possible approaches and
their relative advantages and disadvantages for a given
situation, we assume that the consumer selects the approach that best meets his or her goals for that situation.
Thus, consumers may select different approaches in different situations as their goals, the constraints of the situation, and/or their knowledge change (for a discussion of
the potential infinite regress problem of ‘‘deciding how
to decide how to decide . . . ’’ see Payne et al. [1993],
pp. 107–108). In summary, we propose:

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

Proposition 1.4: Individuals have a repertoire of different strategies for solving decision problems. This repertoire
will vary across individuals depending on their experience
and training.
Proposition 1.5: Different strategies vary in their advantages and disadvantages with respect to accomplishing different goals in a given situation. These relative advantages
and disadvantages may be a function of consumers’ skills
and knowledge and will vary from one choice environment
to another.
Proposition 1.6: Consumers select the strategy that best
meets their goals for a particular situation given the array
of possible strategies and their advantages/disadvantages
with respect to these goals.

This general outline of our choice goals approach
shows how constructive processing may occur. However,
to better understand the approach, we examine how it can
be made more specific. In particular, first we examine
situations where maximizing accuracy and minimizing
effort are the two major focal goals and show how our
approach can explain such decisions. Then we consider
situations where the goal of minimizing negative emotion
is also relevant. Finally, we examine a particularly interesting case where both perceptual factors and the goal of
ease of justification are relevant.

Analyzing Situations Where Accuracy
and Effort Goals Predominate
For many consumer choices, there is little emotional
involvement or need to justify. In such situations, we and
others argue that two preeminent goals for a decision are
maximizing the accuracy of the decision and minimizing
the cognitive effort involved in reaching that decision
(e.g., Beach and Mitchell 1978; Hogarth 1987; Payne,
Bettman, and Johnson 1993; Shugan 1980).
Assessing Cognitive Effort and Accuracy. The choice
goals framework is most useful if we have conceptually
appropriate and easily calculable measures of the various
goals and the extent to which different strategies accomplish these goals in different task environments. For example, we have proposed measures of cognitive effort and
accuracy. With respect to cognitive effort, any decision
strategy can be decomposed into more elementary information processes (EIPs), such as reading an item of information, comparing two items of information, multiplying
or adding items of information, eliminating items of information, and so on (see Chase [1978] for a general discussion of using EIPs to analyze information processing). A
lexicographic strategy, for example, could be conceptualized as reading the value for each attribute weight, comparing the weight just read with the largest weight found
previously until the most important attribute has been
found, and then reading the values for the options on that
attribute and comparing them until the largest value is
found. A weighted adding strategy could be thought of
as reading weights and values, multiplying the two, mov-

cresas

UC: Con Res

<-----Page 9----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

ing on to the next weight and value and multiplying them,
adding the products, and so on. Thus, for any given strategy, a representation in terms of EIPs can be developed.
When the given strategy is applied to make a selection
in a given situation, how many EIPs of each type were
required to make that selection can be determined. The
number of EIPs used will be a function of the specific
rule, the size and other characteristics of the problem, and
the specific values of the data (see Payne et al. [1993],
chap. 3, for detailed examples). Cognitive effort can then
be defined as a function of the number and types of EIPs
needed to complete a task (i.e., some EIPs require more
effort than others). This approach to measuring cognitive
effort has been validated by showing that the time to make
a decision using a specified strategy and individuals’ selfreports of the effort required are modeled quite well by
weighted counts of the EIPs characterizing that strategy
(Bettman, Johnson, and Payne 1990).
The accuracy of a decision strategy can be defined by
using the weighted adding model, which is a normative
model in that it specifies how individuals can best reflect
their preferences if certain assumptions about those preferences are met (Keeney and Raiffa 1976). A decision
process that selects the same option as the weighted adding rule is therefore an accurate process. Accuracy can
also be defined by avoidance of choice patterns such as
intransitivities or selection of dominated options. Finally,
accuracy can be defined by examining properties of the
decision process. Choice processes such as weighted adding that are both compensatory and extensive, utilizing
all relevant information, are typically considered more
normative (Frisch and Clemen 1994); see Hammond
(1996) for a discussion of alternative conceptions of
choice accuracy. Given these measures of cognitive effort
and accuracy, we can characterize the accuracy and effort
of various strategies in particular environments by running a computer simulation of each strategy in each environment and keeping track of the number of EIPs used
for each choice and the option chosen (Johnson and Payne
1985).
Although a good deal of progress has been made in
assessing the accuracy and cognitive effort of alternative
strategies, several unresolved issues remain. For example,
some strategies have not been specified at a process level
in terms of EIPs. An important example of this is Tversky
and Simonson’s (1993) componential context model and
its potential variants discussed above. In general, relational heuristics that might arise in choice problems that
are more perceptual in nature have not been formulated
in process terms. One goal for future research, therefore,
is to develop process versions of such heuristics in terms
of EIPs (e.g., the componential context model would involve reads, difference operations, comparisons, additions, and so on). Then the effort and accuracy required
for such heuristics could be simulated.
Also, work to date has not adequately taken the difficulty of implementing strategies into account. For in-

stance, computational errors are more likely for strategies
like weighted adding than for the lexicographic heuristic;
errors in keeping one’s place in the process may be more
likely for strategies such as EBA, where the consumer
must keep track of exactly which options have already
been eliminated. Such computational errors and memory
or ‘‘bookkeeping’’ operations have generally not been
included in the models to date. In addition, computational
difficulties due to the complexity of the ratings for the
options (e.g., ratings that involve unwieldy fractions)
have not been modeled, although there is evidence that
such complexity can influence processing (Johnson,
Payne, and Bettman 1988). Finally, implementation difficulty also depends on the individual’s processing skills,
which will vary as a function of such factors as socioeconomic status (Capon and Burke 1980), age (e.g., children
[Capon and Kuhn 1980; Gregan-Paxton and John 1995;
Roedder 1981] or the elderly [Cole and Balasubramanian
1993]), and expertise (Alba and Hutchinson 1987).
Therefore, modeling implementation difficulty is another
major area for research in specifying the accuracy and
effort of strategies more precisely.
Using Effort and Accuracy Values to Make Predictions.
To show how such values might then be used, consider
the hypothetical example shown in Figure 1. This figure
shows the average accuracy (measured in terms of the
percentage attained of the optimal weighted adding value)
and average effort (in total EIPs) for five strategies:
weighted adding, lexicographic, EBA, equal weight, and

random choice. A preference function (reflecting the decision maker’s relative emphasis on the goals of accuracy
and effort) has also been shown; although it has been
depicted as linear for the sake of simplicity, a nonlinear
monotonic function could be used as well. Finally, we
have also indicated an effort constraint.
For the moment, ignore the effort constraint. With the
given preference function, a consumer would select the
equal weight strategy for this environment. We can model
the effect of changes in the decision maker’s relative
emphasis on accuracy versus effort by changing the slope
of the preference function. For example, as the preference
function became less steep (reflecting a greater relative
desire for accuracy), the consumer would eventually select weighted adding; if it were made more steep (reflecting a greater relative concern for effort), the consumer could eventually select EBA or even random
choice. Research supports such predictions; decision makers instructed to maximize decision accuracy shift to more
extensive, less selective, and more alternative-based processing when compared to decision makers instructed to
minimize effort (Creyer, Bettman, and Payne 1990;
Payne, Bettman, and Luce 1996).
Now consider the original preference function and the
effort constraint. For that constraint, only the lexicographic, EBA, and random choice strategies are feasible,
and the lexicographic strategy would be selected. Thus,
this simple example shows how variables such as time
pressure might influence strategy selection by imposing
an effort constraint.
Finally, we consider how choice strategies might shift
depending on characteristics of the decision environment.
In Figure 2 we plot a second set of accuracy and effort
values for the decision strategies in a second decision
environment. This pattern of values emphasizes that the
accuracy and effort characterizing a given strategy can
be highly dependent on the situation. In this case the
lexicographic strategy has become more accurate and the
equal weight strategy less accurate in environment B.
Such changes might occur if the variance across the
weights characterizing the attributes for the options was
high in environment B and low in environment A. Thus,
the heuristic best meeting the consumer’s accuracy and
effort goals can vary across environments. For the example in Figure 2, equal weight would be selected for environment A, but the lexicographic strategy would be used
for environment B. Note that although we focus on specific strategies in this discussion, the results also provide
some insights into the kinds of processing to be expected
(e.g., the prevalence of attribute-based or alternativebased processing, selectivity, and extent of processing)
if consumers selected strategies according to this framework.
We have carried out the approach outlined above to
examine the effects of several different features of decision environments (e.g., time pressure [Payne et al. 1988,
1996], interattribute correlation [Bettman et al. 1993],

and relative weights on accuracy and effort goals [Creyer
et al. 1990]). In each case the processing results were in
line with the predictions derived by using accuracy and
effort goals to predict strategy usage. We will examine
in more detail how this approach may apply to specific
consumer decision-making situations when we review the
findings on constructive consumer choice. Next, however,
we examine consumer choice situations where negative
emotion may be evoked and consider the implications of
adding the goal of minimizing negative emotion to those
for accuracy and effort.

Analyzing Situations Where Minimizing
Negative Emotion Is Relevant
Consumers sometimes face emotion-laden choices.
Such choices arise when there are choice conflicts between goals that are very important to the individual (e.g.,
one cannot attain all goals given the set of available options and must give up something on one important goal
to attain more of another important goal). In such cases,
trade-offs are required that the individual does not want
to make, since trade-offs in such situations involve giving
up attainment of some goal on which the individual does
not wish to accept a loss. Examples of such emotionladen consumer choices include trading off the safety of
an automobile against environmental concerns (if larger
vehicles fare better in crashes but worse in gas mileage)
or trading off health risks due to the presence of insects

cresas

<-----Page 11----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

in one’s house versus health risks from having chemicals
sprayed in one’s yard. Such choices can easily lead to
negative emotion, since the trade-offs required represent
threats to the attainment of important or valued goals
(Lazarus 1991). The degree of emotion often depends
on the values of the options (e.g., the degree of conflict
and which specific attributes are involved in the conflict).
Note that the nature of emotion-laden choices is such
that the ensuing negative emotion is associated with the
decision itself and not with some unrelated ambient affect
such as negative mood attributable to background noise
at the site where the decision must be made (see Isen
[1997] for a discussion of affect and decision making).
We believe that individuals may cope with emotionladen decisions by altering processing to escape negative
emotion. Choice processes under negative emotion may
therefore be affected by accuracy and effort concerns as
modified by emotion minimization concerns. In particular, two general coping strategies may apply in emotionladen situations: problem-focused coping (direct actions
aimed at improving the person-environment relationship
eliciting the emotion) and emotion-focused coping (indirect actions aimed at minimizing emotion through
changes in the amount or content of thought about the
situation; Folkman and Lazarus 1988). These two forms
of coping are typically used simultaneously (Folkman
and Lazarus 1988; Terry 1994).
Problem-focused coping involves direct efforts to solve
the problem at hand. In decision making, we argue that
problem-focused coping will involve attempting to identify the most accurate decision alternative. This motivation to perform accurately should be particularly associated with extensive processing. Such extensive processing
is the most readily available (to oneself) and observable
(to others) indicator of one’s motivation to be accurate.
When asked to list factors associated with accurate decisions, individuals most often list consideration of all relevant information (Payne et al. 1988, p. 551, n. 4). Hence,
we expect that increased negative emotion due to the
choice situation will lead to more extensive processing.
Emotion-focused coping often involves avoidant behaviors. Thus, one way in which emotion-focused coping
may be brought to bear on emotion-laden choices is
avoidance of those aspects of the decision that are particularly emotion provoking. The aspect of emotion-laden
choices that is most taxing is making the difficult tradeoffs required, because trade-offs call attention to losses.
Many researchers have argued that trade-offs are uncomfortable and are avoided when possible (Hogarth 1987;
Tetlock 1992; Tversky and Shafir 1992), and we believe
this tendency is exacerbated when choices are emotion
laden. Therefore, individuals may cope with emotionladen decisions by avoiding explicit trade-offs; such
avoidance can be accomplished by using noncompensatory strategies (Hogarth 1987), particularly those noncompensatory strategies in which processing is attribute
based. Attribute-based processing minimizes confronting

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

197

the possibility that one attribute must be sacrificed to gain
on another, but alternative-based processing highlights
such trade-offs.
Our choice goals approach argues that in negatively
emotion-laden choices, consumers will simultaneously
process more extensively (reflecting the goal of accuracy)
and in a more attribute-based fashion (reflecting a goal
of coping with negative emotion), a pattern that in fact
has been supported (Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997).
The conceptual analyses above and these results support
the notion that examining how other important goals, such
as minimizing negative emotion, interact with goals for
maximizing accuracy and minimizing effort can lead to
insights into consumer decision making (Garbarino and
Edell [1997] demonstrate another way in which such
goals may interact, arguing that expending cognitive effort on evaluating options can lead to negative affect and
influence choice).
Note that one difference between our analysis of decisions involving emotion and our analysis of the effects
of accuracy and effort is that we have to date no easy
measure for the amount of emotion characterizing a decision. Unlike the case of measuring cognitive effort addressed above, the amount of emotion generated in making a decision is not likely to be primarily a function of
the processes involved in a strategy. Rather the degree of
emotion will depend in a complex fashion on the content
of the decision (i.e., the specific attributes involved and
their properties), characteristics of the consumer (since
what is emotion laden for one person may not be for
another), properties of the decision task such as the
amount of conflict, and the type of processing carried out.
Thus, measuring the extent of emotion on-line (i.e., during a decision process) and modeling the determinants of
the emotional difficulty of a choice task are important
topics for future research on the choice goals framework
(see Richins [1997] for work on measuring the emotions
characterizing consumption experiences). In the next section we add a fourth major goal, maximizing ease of
justification, to our consideration of constructive consumer choice.

Analyzing Situations Where Maximizing Ease
of Justification Is Relevant
Consumer decisions are often evaluated, either by others to whom one is accountable or by oneself. Hence,
consumers often must be able to justify or provide reasons
for a decision (Shafir, Simonson, and Tversky 1993).
Accountability and the need to justify decisions to others
can have important effects on consumer decisions. Tetlock (1992) has proposed a contingency approach that
allows for both effort-minimizing and accuracy-maximizing responses to increased accountability. In particular,
Tetlock argues that people will cope with accountability
in some situations by simply deferring to the preferences
of the person(s) to whom they are accountable, an effort-

minimizing strategy. However, people’s inferences about
the preferences of others may not be very accurate. For
example, Hoch (1988) has shown that consumers have
low accuracy when predicting the interests and opinions
of the typical American consumer. If the preferences of
those to whom one is accountable are not known, Tetlock
proposes that individuals may process more thoroughly.
Even in this case, more thorough processing may lead to
poor results if the extra effort is not devoted to diagnostic
information.
We believe that the effects of a goal of maximizing
ease of justification cannot be fully accounted for by accuracy and effort considerations, however. In particular, the
need to consider other factors beyond accuracy and effort
is especially likely to be true for choice problems that are
more perceptual in nature (i.e., small numbers of alternatives and attributes depicted either graphically or using
simple tables of numerical ratings). Consider, for example, the choice problem among cars shown in Table 3
(Simonson 1989). This choice problem is an example of
a problem involving asymmetric dominance (i.e., brand
C is dominated by brand B but not by brand A), and it
is very easy to detect these relationships among the options at a glance. In problems of this sort, adding brand
C to a choice set originally consisting of brand A and
brand B increases the choice share of the dominating
alternative, brand B (Huber et al. 1982). If consumers
are asked to justify their choices, the strength of this effect
increases (Simonson 1989). As noted by Tversky (1996,
p. 17), such violations of context independence indicate
that ‘‘people do not maximize a precomputed preference
order, but construct their choices in the light of available
options.’’ How can this result be explained by our choice
goals approach?
We believe that Simonson’s (1989) original insight is
correct: that increased accountability leads consumers to
weight ease of justification more heavily, that this goal
leads to a search for good reasons to use as justifications,
and that the asymmetric dominance relationship provides
a good reason (anyone can easily see B is better than C).
We now analyze further how such choice based on reasons (Shafir et al. 1993) fits within our framework. This
analysis is more speculative than those above, since most
research in this area has not been based on a choice goals
approach.
We assert that for simple, more perceptual problems,

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

relational heuristics (such as the componential context
model or its variants) are both easy to apply and provide
good reasons. The fact that option B dominates option C
is a good reason for choosing option B at an outcome
level of explanation (it is clearly a better outcome than
C). There is no need to refer to a process-level explanation (e.g., I chose B over A because of the trade-offs I
prefer between ride quality and miles per gallon). Outcomes are likely to be more salient than process in the
wake of a decision, so arguments based on outcomes may
provide better reasons. In fact, serious concerns often
arise in decision analysis and managerial decision making
because of this focus on outcomes and avoidance of process explanations (e.g., Baron and Hershey 1988).
Thus, relational heuristics appear to perform well both
with respect to ease of justification and effort goals. Even
though information on the relationships between options
must be generated, such relationship information is very
easy to assess and process for simple problems. Using such
relationship information as a reason allows the consumer
to avoid making trade-offs, leading to the prediction that
asymmetric dominance effects might increase as trade-offs
become more emotionally difficult (since using the asymmetric dominance relationship to avoid trade-offs would be
even more appealing). Luce (1998) reports some empirical
support for this prediction. Thus, relational notions may
also help minimize negative emotions in some cases.
For this case of asymmetric dominance, therefore, a
complex interaction of multiple goals may explain the
effects observed. Noting relationships among the options
and using these relationships as a basis for choice accomplishes some combination of minimizing effort, minimizing negative emotion, and maximizing ease of justification. It is less clear how using such relationships affects
accuracy; this probably depends on the exact structure of
the choice sets, suggesting that manipulating choice-set
structure so that the relationship information either is consistent or inconsistent with accuracy goals is a promising
research direction. We suspect that such a complex interplay of goals will be the norm for choices involving justification issues.
The above arguments depend heavily on the notion that
asymmetric dominance relationships are generally quite
simple and perceptual in nature and that the dominance
relations are very easy to assess. We also argue that the
very salience of such relations is part of what makes them
good reasons. However, for problems of any complexity,
such relationships may be more difficult to assess. For example, as the number of attributes increases, the number
of required pairwise attribute comparisons increases, and
the consumer may not be able to make the comparisons in
a simple, perceptual fashion (i.e., it may not be easy to
take in the options ‘‘at a glance’’). In these more complex
situations, the amount of effort expended or the goodness
of the outcome may be the easiest aspects of the choice for
the individual or observer to assess, unlike the obviousness
and salience of relational properties in simpler situations.

cresas

<-----Page 13----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

Thus, we hypothesize that relational reasons will be used
less as problems become more complex and/or those relations are made more difficult and less transparent. Further
research on how problem complexity affects the use of
relational notions as reasons is needed.
The search for reasons may not always lead to effort
savings, however. The arguments for effort savings above
focused on the use of relational properties. Developing
justifications may actually require more effort in other
situations. For example, Luce (1998) shows that consumers choosing the status quo option, which has been argued
to lead to better justifications, actually took more time to
make a choice than consumers who did not select the
status quo. Thus, more research is needed on measuring
the justifiability of different strategies across situations
and the effort those strategies require.
We have now presented the basic ideas underlying our
choice goals approach. Although some aspects have been
the subject of a good deal of research (e.g., accuracy and
effort goals), the role of negative emotion has seen more
limited research, and the role of ease of justification is
admittedly more speculative. We now review the evidence for constructive consumer choice and address how
those results can be accounted for within our integrated
framework. We organize the review as we did the discussion of the framework, first considering research on situations where accuracy and effort goals appear to predominate, then choices where negative emotions play a major
role, and finally addressing choices involving justification
issues. In each subsection we summarize the major findings as propositions; these propositions are summarized
in Appendix B.

EVIDENCE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE
CONSUMER CHOICE: CHOICE TASKS
WHERE ACCURACY AND EFFORT
GOALS PREDOMINATE
Many findings in research on consumer decision making can be accounted for in terms of accuracy and effort
goals. For instance, one natural focus, given an emphasis
on accuracy and effort goals, has been on factors influencing problem difficulty and how consumers cope with
such difficulty. In addition to effects of problem difficulty,
researchers have also examined one other important aspect of the decision task itself: the type of response required of consumers (response mode). Recall that rational choice theory assumes that preferences will not vary
across strategically equivalent methods of eliciting preferences. Finally, there has been research addressing how
the knowledge individual consumers bring to decision
tasks affects decision making.

Consumer Choice Research
on Problem Difficulty
We consider six main subtopics under research on
problem difficulty: problem size, time pressure, attribute

correlation, completeness of information, information format, and comparable versus noncomparable choice. In
general, decisions become more difficult as the amount
of information increases, as the time resources available
for processing the available information decrease, as the
degree of conflict among attributes increases, as the
amount of missing information increases, as the information display format becomes less organized or more complex, and as the number of shared attributes describing
the options is smaller. For each topic we first consider
the basic findings and then address how our framework
accounts for these findings.
Problem Size. Studies of the effects of problem size
show that increases in the number of alternatives facing
the consumer lead to greater use of noncompensatory
strategies that eliminate alternatives (e.g., Johnson and
Meyer 1984; Payne 1976). Compensatory strategies,
however, are more common for small numbers of options.
Changes in the number of attributes do not appear to lead
to strategy changes as readily but may increase selectivity
(Olshavsky 1979; Payne 1976). Gregan-Paxton and John
(1997b) have recently extended this line of research to
examine decision processing by children; they find that
older (ages 10–11) children adapt by searching less exhaustively for larger problems, but younger (ages 7–8)
children adapt to larger problems only when search costs
are explicitly made salient. Finally, Otnes, Lowrey, and
Shrum (1997), using in-depth interviews, found that
brides-to-be often (but not always) respond to the complexities of planning a wedding by simplification.
Our framework accounts for these findings by examining the way changes in the number of alternatives
and attributes affect the accuracy and effort for various
strategies. Payne et al. ( 1993, pp. 133 – 137 ) report simulation results showing that the relative accuracy of
heuristics is fairly robust over changes in the number
of alternatives, that the relative accuracy of heuristics
other than weighted adding is sensitive to the number
of attributes, and that the effort required to implement
other heuristics increases much less rapidly with problem size than the effort required for weighted adding.
Thus, heuristics other than weighted adding will appear
relatively more efficient as the number of alternatives
increases; in addition, selective, attribute-based heuristics such as lexicographic and EBA also appear relatively attractive under these conditions ( Payne et al.
1993 ) . These simulation results are consistent with the
empirical results reported above.
A critical issue related to problem size is whether consumers can be given too much information. The issue
of possible information overload has been of continued
interest in consumer research, with major information
provision implications for both marketers and policy makers. For example, if providing more information could
lead to harmful effects, then policies requiring new information might have impacts opposite to those intended.

Initial research on information load (Jacoby, Speller, and
Kohn 1974a, 1974b) claimed that consumers could be
overloaded and that consumers made poorer decisions
with more information. Several researchers rapidly debated this conclusion and argued that consumers in those
studies in fact made more accurate decisions if the amount
of information per alternative was increased (Russo 1974;
Summers 1974; Wilkie 1974); accuracy only suffered
when more alternatives were added. Others have subsequently found decreases in accuracy as the amount of
information per alternative was increased as well (Keller
and Staelin 1987; Malhotra 1982), but controversy still
surrounds the interpretation of these results (Keller and
Staelin 1989; Meyer and Johnson 1989). A major problem is identifying a good decision. Most studies use subjects’ attribute importance ratings to ascertain the ‘‘best’’
alternative; however, these ratings are subject to error, and
this error often covaries with the amount of information
(Meyer and Johnson 1989).
Given these problems in defining accurate choices, we
suggest a reorientation of research on information load.
Rather than focus on accuracy directly, we believe that
the essence of consumer response to information load
is selectivity. The critical issue, then, is how consumers
become selective as load increases. That is, how do problem size and other factors (e.g., expertise, information
format, perceptual factors) interact to influence consumers’ decisions about which information to select for examination? If consumers become selective in ways that reflect their values, then overload may not be too harmful.
However, if selectivity is based on surface features of the
decision task such as perceptual salience or format, and
these surface features are not reflective of consumers’
underlying values, then substantial decreases in accuracy
are possible. In summary:
Proposition 2.1: Increases in the number of alternatives
lead to a greater use of noncompensatory choice strategies.
Increases in the number of attributes generally leads to
increased selectivity, but not strategy changes.
Proposition 2.2: Information load will not be harmful to
accuracy if consumers select a subset of the information
that reflects their values; if selectivity is based on problem
features that do not reflect consumers’ underlying values,
information load can decrease accuracy.

Time Pressure. As the pace of life accelerates, consumers may feel that they are subject to increased time
pressure. Time pressure has clear effects on choice processes. Payne et al. (1988) found that individuals engaged
in a hierarchy of responses when faced with increased
time pressure. Under moderate time pressure, individuals
processed each item of information more rapidly (acceleration) and became somewhat selective. Under more severe time pressure, people accelerated their processing,
became more selective, and changed their decision strategies. In particular, they switched to more attribute-based
processing, which characterizes such strategies as lexico-

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

graphic or EBA; when time pressure is severe, it appears
that quickly examining at least some information on each
option is more effective than examining a limited set of
options in depth. Similar findings are reported by Payne
et al. (1996) when time stress was manipulated by varying the opportunity cost of delaying decisions; by Pieters,
Warlop, and Hartog (1997) for visual scans of brand
displays; and by Eisenhardt (1989) for firms processing
alternatives in high-velocity environments. Some fascinating research supporting such breadth-rather-than-depth
strategies is provided by Jacoby et al. (1994). Jacoby and
his colleagues allowed consumers to access information
about birth control options and measured consumers’ degree of certainty regarding their choice of birth control
method after each item of information was acquired. In
one condition, Jacoby et al. controlled the format of acquisition to be either alternative based or attribute based.
Consumers’ feelings of uncertainty were reduced more
during within-attribute searches; when search was constrained to be within-alternative, uncertainty remained
high until almost all options were examined. Since all
options cannot be examined in depth in many instances
of time pressure, these results provide corroborating evidence for consumers’ preferences for within-attribute
search under time pressure.
Such shifts to attribute-based processing can be predicted based on accuracy and effort concerns. Effort is
essentially fixed under time pressure. Payne et al. (1988)
also show that accuracy decreases markedly for weighted
adding under severe time pressure because there is not
enough time to complete processing, yet the accuracy of
attribute-based heuristics such as lexicographic and EBA
is much more robust under time pressure.
Time pressure has other effects on shifting the focus
of attention. For example, Wright (1974) reports that
consumers place greater emphasis on negative information about options under time pressure. This shift in focus
of attention could be due to both goal-driven (e.g.,
avoiding bad options) or involuntary (e.g., threats being
very salient) factors. The major results for time pressure
can be summarized as:
Proposition 2.3: Under moderate time pressure, consumers process more rapidly and become more selective. Under
more severe time pressure, individuals switch to more attribute-based heuristics.
Proposition 2.4: Consumers weight negative information
more heavily under time pressure.

Attribute Correlation. Interattribute correlation is related to notions of dominance; when the number of attributes is small, removing dominated options leads to more
negative interattribute correlation for the remaining options (Curry and Faulds 1986). Interattribute correlation
is also related to the concept of conflict among the attribute criteria: the more negative the correlations, the more
one has to give up something on one attribute in order to
get more of another attribute.

cresas

<-----Page 15----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

Bettman et al. (1993) show that many simplifying heuristics become less accurate, compared to the weighted
adding model, when interattribute correlations become
more negative. Thus, if accuracy concerns are salient, our
framework predicts that consumers may shift to more
extensive, less selective, and more alternative-based processing under negative correlation.
Bettman et al. (1993) found this hypothesized shift
toward more normative processing under negative correlation, but replication in a consumer context is needed.
Widing and Talarzyk (1993) provide suggestive evidence
supportive of the hypothesized relationship between use
of the weighted adding strategy and correlation. They
showed that a decision aid that provided weighted average
scores using importance weights provided by the user was
highly favorably evaluated by users and resulted in the
best decision accuracy in a negative correlation environment (better than a decision aid based on cutoffs and an
unaided format). In contrast, Johnson, Meyer, and Ghose
(1989) found that their subjects did not appear to shift
strategies; however, they also manipulated the number of
options, and subjects may have focused on that manipulation and may have failed to perceive correlation accurately (Huber and Klein 1991; Klein and Yadav 1989).
Although there is some evidence that negative correlation may be associated with more alternative-based processing, this relationship may not hold for all types of
decision tasks. Luce, et al. (1997, experiment 3) showed
that processing became more attribute based as correlations became more negative when the decisions were
more emotion laden. We speculate that negative correlation leads to more alternative-based processing for less
emotional decision tasks but to more attribute-based processing for more emotion-laden decisions, because alternative-based processing is likely to elicit negative emotion by highlighting difficult trade-offs in the latter case.
To summarize:
Proposition 2.5: Consumers engage in processing more
like weighted adding (more extensive, less selective, and
more alternative based) under negative interattribute correlation in less emotional decision tasks.

Completeness of Information. Consumers may wish
to have a complete set of information about the brands
and attributes they choose to consider. However, this is
often not the case. What happens when one or more options are partially described (i.e., there is missing information)? Decision makers might respond in a variety of
ways to such a circumstance. The consumer might try to
infer the missing value based on other available information. Two such types of available information for inferring
a missing attribute value for a given option are other
values for that attribute in the set of options (other-brand
information) and values for other attributes of the given
option (same-brand information). Early work (e.g.,
Huber and McCann 1982; Meyer 1981) argued that con-

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

201

sumers used other-brand information, namely, the average
value of the attribute for the other options, discounted to
take account of the fact that there was uncertainty. Johnson and Levin (1985) argued that same-brand information
was used, and Ford and Smith (1987) also found that
consumers were influenced more by information about
other attributes of the same brand than by other-brand
information.
Other research, however, has taken a contingency viewpoint, arguing that whether other-brand or same-brand
information is used is a function of properties of the
choice task. Several researchers have invoked the Feldman and Lynch (1988) accessibility-diagnosticity framework as the basis for their contingency approaches. Dick,
Chakravarti, and Biehal (1990), for example, argue that
consumers for whom attribute information is more accessible are more likely to make inferences using interattribute correlation (same-brand information). Ross and
Creyer (1992) propose that consumers use other-brand
information when it is diagnostic, perhaps because it is
less effortful, only examining same-brand information if
other-brand information is not diagnostic. However, some
researchers have sounded cautionary notes; Simmons and
Lynch (1991), for example, note that the discounting
effects noted above may not be mediated by inferencing.
Broniarczyk and Alba (1994) point out that consumers’
intuitive beliefs about likely attribute relationships may
be dominant in inferencing, even when they conflict with
the available same-brand or other-brand information.
The application of the choice goals framework to these
results is relatively straightforward. Consumers have heuristics for making inferences about missing information
(e.g., same-brand or other-brand). The use of such heuristics appears to be governed by accessibility-diagnosticity
trade-offs. Feldman and Lynch (1988) define the diagnosticity of an input in terms of the degree to which the
decision implied by that input would accomplish the individual’s goals for the choice in question (e.g., maximize
accuracy, maximize ease of justification). Effort is also
a major component of their approach, both with respect
to accessibility and the termination of search by a diagnosticity threshold. Since accuracy has been a salient goal
in many accessibility-diagnosticity studies, accessibilitydiagnosticity trade-offs may be essentially effort-accuracy
trade-offs in those situations. However, in other situations
accessibility-diagnosticity concerns can also refer to a
balance among the broader set of choice goals we have
proposed. Finally, the Broniarczyk and Alba (1994) results are explainable by noting that generalizing from
intuitive beliefs is even less effortful than using samebrand or other-brand information.
Proposition 2.6: Consumers may infer values for a missing attribute using heuristics based on other-brand information (other values for that attribute in the set of options)
or same-brand information (values for other attributes of
the same brand with the missing value). Which type of

cresas

<-----Page 16----->JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

202
heuristic is used depends on the relative accessibility and
diagnosticity of each type of information.

Information Format. The organization of information
displays can have a major impact on consumer choices.
Russo (1977) provides a classic illustration; he argued
that normal unit price displays, with separate tags for each
item, were difficult to process when attempting to make
price comparisons. He argued that making such comparisons easier by providing unit price information in the
form of a sorted list, with brands ranked in order of increasing unit price, would increase consumers’ usage of
unit prices. In a field experiment, he showed that consumers saved about 2 percent, on average, with the list display. Thus, consumer decision making was affected by
making some information easier to process. Simply making information easier to process is not always sufficient,
however. Russo et al. (1986) found no effects from listing
positive nutrients (e.g., vitamins), but did find effects if
negative nutrients (e.g., sugar) were listed. To use the
lists consumers must be motivated, even if they are easily
processable; consumers apparently did not feel they
needed to worry about positive nutrients (they could take
a vitamin pill) but were motivated to avoid negative ones.
Finally, Bettman, Payne, and Staelin (1986) outline principles for providing warning information in less effortful
formats that encourage processing of such warnings.
A related display effect concerns the impact of display
format on information acquisition. Slovic (1972) suggested a ‘‘concreteness’’ principle: decision makers will
tend to use only that information that is explicitly displayed and will use it in the form it is displayed, without
transforming it. Such behavior reduces the cognitive effort required to process the information. A related concept
is the so-called focusing phenomenon in mental models,
in which thoughts are restricted to what is explicitly represented in the mental model (Legrenzi, Girotto, and Johnson-Laird 1993). In addition, when individuals construct
mental models of a situation, they often make as little
information as possible explicit in order to minimize cognitive load.
The concreteness principle is supported by Bettman
and Kakkar’s (1977) finding that individuals indeed acquired information in a manner consistent with the form
of the display (by attribute or by brand), and Jarvenpaa
(1989) extended these results to the case of graphical
displays. A similar finding is that sequential presentation
of information leads to more significant pioneering effects
(e.g., more learning about the pioneer and greater likelihood of including the pioneer in the consideration set;
Kardes and Kalyanaram 1992; Kardes et al. 1993).
Several authors show that the concreteness effect does
not always hold, however. Concreteness is likely to hold
when the costs of following the given format (both the
acquisition costs and opportunity costs due to losses in
accuracy) are low. If those costs are more pronounced,
consumers may depart from the given format. Coupey

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

(1994), for example, shows that consumers will restructure information if it enables them to facilitate choice.
Restructuring is more likely when information is poorly
structured and hard to process in its original form. The
specific form of restructuring depends on the sources of
difficulty (e.g., consumers may rescale information if it
is presented in different units). Thus, the form in which
consumers represent the choice problem is a function of
accuracy and effort considerations.
The consumers’ task goals may also affect where the
concreteness principle holds. Sethuraman, Cole, and Jain
(1994) show that concreteness holds if the consumer’s
task is to screen a set of options to see which are acceptable, since this task can be done without regard to order
of presentation of information. However, if the task is
to choose the first acceptable option (satisficing), then
information is processed by brand regardless of the format. Thus, accuracy considerations can override the potential effort savings. Finally, Biehal and Chakravarti
(1982) show that memory organization can interact with
format; prior brand-based memory organization, for example, weakens the effects of attribute-based formats.
These results can be readily explained within our
framework by noting that different information formats
make some forms of processing easier and less effortful
and hence more likely. The concreteness principle and
governance of the processing of information by the form
of the display are also explainable by cognitive effort
considerations when the other acquisition costs and potential accuracy losses are low. However, if processing is
difficult in the original format or there are potential accuracy losses, consumers may process in ways that depart
from the format. Summarizing these results, we propose
Proposition 2.7: Different information formats can make
some forms of processing easier and less effortful than
others. The processing encouraged by the format will be
more likely; however, potential accuracy losses due to the
encouraged form of processing will lessen the effect of
format.

Comparable versus Noncomparable Choices. For
many years consumer choice researchers focused on decision processes in choice sets where the alternatives were
members of the same product class, such as selecting
among brands of automobiles or microwaves. Johnson
(1984, 1986) pioneered work on choice among noncomparable options. For example, a consumer might try to
decide whether to spend some extra money on a vacation,
a new stereo, or some new cooking equipment. Such options are called noncomparable because the attributes that
describe them differ across the options. Ratneshwar,
Pechmann, and Shocker (1996) examined conditions that
might lead to such noncomparable choice sets and found
that consumers developed consideration sets with alternatives from different product categories when there was
goal conflict (one category could not satisfy all of the

cresas

UC: Con Res

<-----Page 17----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

consumer’s goals) or goal ambiguity (no clear, salient
goals).
Processing can differ between comparable and noncomparable choices. Johnson (1984) showed that as options become more noncomparable, consumers represent
attributes at more abstract levels (e.g., enjoyment or necessity) in order to allow comparisons. At some point,
however, consumers switch to developing overall evaluations of each option and comparing those evaluations.
Bettman and Sujan (1987) argued that a fundamental
distinction between comparable and noncomparable
choice situations is that criteria are more readily available
for the comparable choice. When a criterion (e.g., reliability) was primed for the noncomparable situations, decision processes resembled those for the case of comparable
options. In related work, Huffman and Houston (1993)
showed that the presence of goals helps to structure and
focus the acquisition of information, even in unfamiliar
situations, and West, Brown, and Hoch (1996) found that
providing consumers with a consumption vocabulary led
to better-defined preferences.
These results can be explained by invoking effort and
accuracy notions. In fact, Johnson (1986) developed
models for the effort and accuracy of the within-attribute
abstraction and across-attribute overall evaluation strategies and derived conditions under which each strategy
was likely to be used based on accuracy-effort trade-offs.
The Bettman and Sujan (1987) results can be explained
by noting that their priming task makes a particular criterion more accessible, hence enabling consumers to choose
based on that concrete criterion as opposed to making
more effortful inferences about more abstract attributes.
Proposition 2.8: Processing can differ between comparable and noncomparable choices. Consumers can develop
more abstract attributes or compare overall evaluations as
choices become more noncomparable. Their use of these
strategies is governed by accuracy-effort concerns. If a
specific criterion is primed, however, noncomparable
choice processes more closely resemble those for comparable options.

Consumer Choice Research
on Response Mode
A fundamental principle of rational decision theory is
procedure invariance, that is, that preferences should not
depend on the method used to assess them if the methods
are strategically equivalent (Tversky et al. 1988). However, this principle does not seem to hold empirically;
different methods can strongly influence expressed preferences. Mowen and Gentry (1980) show, for example, that
preferences between two new product projects could be
reversed depending on whether the decision maker was
asked to choose one of the projects or designate a price
for the rights to each project. Such preference reversals
are common in many contexts (e.g., Tversky, Slovic, and

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

203

Kahneman 1990). A major contributing factor to preference reversals seems to be that some response modes,
such as choice, evoke qualitative (e.g., comparative) reasoning, whereas other response modes, such as evaluation, evoke more quantitative (e.g., how much more will
I pay) reasoning (Fischer and Hawkins 1993; Slovic,
Griffin, and Tversky 1990). Nowlis and Simonson
(1997) provide supporting evidence for the latter notion.
They show that attributes on which consumers can easily
make comparisons (comparable attributes) assume more
weight in choice, whereas attributes that are difficult to
compare but are meaningful and informative when evaluated on their own (enriched attributes) take on more
weight in tasks where individual options are evaluated.
This difference in emphasis across response modes leads
to systematic preference reversals. Coupey, Irwin, and
Payne (1998) have recently shown that an individual’s
familiarity with the stimuli used can affect the frequency
of preference reversals; in particular, consumers make
fewer choice-matching preference reversals for more familiar products. The biggest impact of familiarity in their
study was on consumers’ responses to the matching task.2
As the above discussion implies, judgment and choice
are not equivalent. When making a judgment, consumers
must provide an overall evaluation of each alternative; in
choice, the consumer must simply pick the most preferred
option. A judgment task thus encourages less selective,
alternative-based processing, whereas a choice task
allows more selectivity and can be attribute based, depending on the strategy used.
Such response mode effects are difficult to undo. In a
classic set of studies, Grether and Plott (1979), for example, found that monetary incentives did not eliminate preference reversals. In general, incentives based on maximizing accuracy often have relatively little impact on
decisions (Tversky and Kahneman 1988), perhaps because incentives appear to lead individuals to increase the
intensity of their behavior (i.e., working harder) without
necessarily changing the direction of that behavior (i.e.,
working smarter). However, providing incentives and
feedback over repeated choices does appear to reduce
preference reversals (Cox and Grether 1996).
The analysis of response mode effects within our
framework is more speculative than the analyses presented above. We argue that response mode alters choice
because it both changes the criterion used for task accuracy and the relative emphasis on accuracy and effort.
The response mode determines the consumer’s criterion
for the task. That is, as noted above, choice requires determining which option is better, whereas other response
modes such as matching and ratings require a quantitative
estimate of how much better one option is over another
or how much to give up on one attribute for more of

In a matching response, an aspect of one option is adjusted so that
this option matches another option in overall value.

another. We believe that this difference in focus means
that there is more relative emphasis on accuracy when
matching or rating and more relative emphasis on effort
when making a choice. Since we have shown above that
changes in the relative emphasis on accuracy versus effort
can change strategy usage, it is perhaps not surprising
that preference assessments might differ across response
modes.3
We can speculate further, however. We hypothesize
that there will be fewer preference reversals between
choice and some quantitative task (e.g., rating or matching) to the degree that the use of heuristics emphasizing
accuracy is encouraged in the choice task. There is suggestive evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Johnson
et al. (1988) found that preference reversals were lower
when processing of the probability information in their
task was made easier by expressing the probabilities as
simple decimals or simple fractions instead of as complex
fractions. Coupey et al.’s (1998) results showing a decrease in preference reversals with familiarity also seem
supportive. One corollary of our hypothesis is that if a
matching task evokes a strategy with greater weight on
one attribute, the results of matching may agree more
with the choice task, since choice is more likely to be
lexicographic in nature. Hence we hypothesize that there
will be fewer choice-matching preference reversals if the
match is carried out on the more important versus the
less important attribute.
Proposition 3.1: Different response modes (e.g., choice
vs. matching) can lead to different preferences and to preference reversals. Choice encourages more selective and
attribute-based comparative processes, whereas rating or
matching encourage less selective, more alternative-based,
quantitative processing.
Proposition 3.2: Preference reversals can be reduced by
making the more quantitative processing easier, by greater
familiarity with the options, and by repeated experience
with incentives and feedback on the task.

Consumer Research on the Interactions
between Consumer Knowledge
and Decision Making
Choice Process and Memory Interactions. Biehal
and Chakravarti (1982, 1983) carried out a classic series
of studies examining the interactions between choice processes and memory. Biehal and Chakravarti (1982) had
consumers either learn information and then choose or
just choose; following the choice task, consumers were

3
Cognitive effort considerations continue to play a role in judgment,
even though there may be more relative emphasis on accuracy. There
is a great deal of evidence for compatibility effects in judgment, i.e.,
that the weight of an attribute in a decision is enhanced by its compatibility with the response scale or strategy used (Fischer and Hawkins 1993;
Slovic et al. 1990).

asked to recall the information. Consumers who first
learned the information tended to organize it in memory
by brand and were more likely to process information in
an alternative-based fashion when making choices. Consumers who chose first were more likely to process by
attribute and to organize their memory in an attributebased fashion. In addition, consumers had much better
memory about the chosen alternative (see also Johnson
and Russo 1984). In their 1983 paper, Biehal and Chakravarti again had consumers either learn information or
make a choice. Then information on new alternatives and
new attributes was provided and a second choice made.
The added attribute information made one of the original
options, which was not likely to be selected originally,
more attractive. Consumers who made a choice first were
less likely to reevaluate and choose that original option,
perhaps because of their decreased memory for the nonchosen option, than the consumers who learned first.
These studies provide convincing evidence that memory
and choice processes interact in interesting and principled
ways (see also Lynch and Srull 1982).
Other research has continued to examine memory and
choice interactions. Lynch, Marmorstein, and Weigold
(1988) showed that consumers will use information in
memory to make a choice when some or all of the options
had to be retrieved from memory if that information is
both accessible and more diagnostic than other accessible
information. In related work, Nedungadi (1990) showed
that brand choice can be influenced by altering the memory
accessibility of a brand, without changing the brand’s evaluation. Hutchinson, Raman, and Mantrala (1994) model
such brand name accessibility as a function of consumer
and marketing mix variables (e.g., usage rate, advertising
spending, market penetration, and product attributes).
We explain such choice-memory interactions by invoking effort considerations. For example, Biehal and Chakravarti’s learning tasks encourage an alternative-based focus, and alternative-based processing would then be less
effortful in choice. Choice, in contrast, tends to be more
comparative and attribute based. Thus, consumers who
chose first would find it more difficult to integrate the
new and old information, because their choice processing
was both more selective and more attribute based. For
consumers that learned first, however, the information
would be stored and processed more by alternative, so
the added information would be easier to integrate with
each option. Finally, work based on accessibility-diagnosticity notions, as noted above, can be viewed in terms of
balancing choice goals.
Proposition 4.1: Because choice processes are selective
and comparative, choice processes influence both which
items are stored in memory and the organization of such
memories. Conversely, information in memory can affect
the form of choice processes.
Proposition 4.2: Consumers will use information in
memory to make a choice to the extent that it is more
accessible and more diagnostic than alternative sources of
information.

Categorization and Choice. Fiske (1982; Fiske and
Pavelchak 1986) has argued that individuals use two basic
modes for evaluating stimuli. In one mode, piecemeal
processing, a stimulus is evaluated by integrating the evaluations of the individual attributes of the stimulus. In
contrast, category-based processing is characterized by
attempting to categorize the stimulus into an existing category; if successful, that category’s evaluation is associated with the stimulus. Fiske and Pavelchak propose a
two-stage contingency approach: in the first stage, categorization is attempted and, if successful, then categorybased evaluation is used. If categorization is not successful, piecemeal processing ensues. Sujan (1985) utilized
this approach in a consumer context, providing evidence
for category-based processing when the information in a
print advertisement matched expectations and evidence
for piecemeal processing when expectations were not met,
with effects greater for experts than for novices (see
Gregan-Paxton and John [1997a] for a modification and
extension of this approach based on internal knowledge
transfer mechanisms). Peracchio and Tybout (1996) also
examined the effects of categorization on evaluations.
They demonstrated that new products were evaluated
more favorably when their attributes were moderately incongruent with a schema (see also Meyers-Levy and Tybout 1989) only when consumers had limited knowledge
about the product category. When consumers had more
extensive knowledge about the category, their evaluations
were influenced by associations to specific attributes
based on their schemas but not by the degree of congruity.
Finally, John and Lakshmi-Ratan (1992) apply categorization notions to children’s choice.
The categorization findings can be explained by considering the accuracy and effort characteristics of the two
classes of strategies, categorization and piecemeal. Categorization is less effortful and relatively accurate when
expectations are met and categorization is successful.
Piecemeal processing is more effortful and generally accurate. Hence, if categorization can be successfully applied, it is both less effortful and relatively accurate, so
it will be used. Sujan’s (1985) finding that novices are
more likely to use categorical processing regardless of
whether expectations are met can also be explained. The
cost of piecemeal processing is less for experts than for
novices because of the experts’ increased ability; hence,
experts are more likely to use piecemeal processing when
expectations are not met.
Gregan-Paxton and John (1997a) have argued that consumers make use of analogies. We also believe that analogies can be used as a choice heuristic. For example,
Schkade and Payne (1994) have shown that consumers
use analogies such as charitable giving when expressing
their preferences for environmental goods. The use of
analogies clearly involves accuracy and effort considerations; an analogy can provide a way of making a choice
in an unfamiliar situation with little effort, with accuracy
depending on the goodness of the analogy. Analogies

do not always lead to accuracy; for example, the use of
analogies may lead to insensitivity to the quantity of a
good (Baron and Greene 1996). Characterizing the properties of analogies in terms of effort, accuracy, experienced negative emotion, and ease of justification, and
then examining the contingent use of analogies would be
promising areas for future research.
Proposition 4.3: Categorical processing is more likely
to be used when expectations are met, with more detailed
(piecemeal) processing more likely when expectations are
not met and the consumer has expertise in the category.

This concludes our review of research where accuracy
and effort goals predominate. Next we consider research
where the goal of minimizing negative emotion must be
taken into account.

EVIDENCE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE
CONSUMER CHOICE: CHOICE TASKS
WHERE MINIMIZING NEGATIVE
EMOTION IS RELEVANT
As discussed above in presenting our framework, we
believe that at times consumers face emotion-laden
choices. We have examined the effects of such negative
emotion on decision processing, choice, and avoidance of
choice. Luce et al. (1997) showed that increased negative
emotion due to more difficult trade-offs or more serious
consequences led to more extensive, more selective, and
more attribute-based processing (consistent with the notion that consumers try to avoid emotion-laden difficult
trade-offs). Luce, Payne, and Bettman (1998) showed
that consumers more often chose an option that was better
on a quality attribute rather than an option better on price
when that quality attribute was rated as inherently more
emotion laden, involved lower attribute values, or involved losses rather than gains. These effects were in
addition to any effects of the consumers’ importance
weights for quality relative to price. Luce (1998) showed
that increases in negative emotion led to increased avoidance of choice; in particular, increased trade-off difficulty
led to increased choice of a status quo option, increased
choice of an asymmetrically dominating alternative, and
a greater tendency to prolong search. In addition, she
demonstrated that choosing an avoidant option resulted
in less negative retrospective emotion. Finally, Kahn and
Baron (1995) found that consumers were likely to use a
noncompensatory, lexicographic rule when making their
own high-stakes decisions, but that consumers wanted
advisors to make decisions for them using compensatory
rules.
Such results have been explained above in describing
the part of our framework dealing with negative emotion.
However, there are two important points still to be made.
First, the results show that individuals process in a more
extensive, more selective, and more attribute-based fash-

cresas

UC: Con Res

<-----Page 20----->JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

206

ion when choices are more emotion laden. Note that this
pattern of more extensive and more attribute-based processing is opposite to that found in all of our studies of
nonemotional choices, where more extensive processing
is linked to more alternative-based processing. Recall also
that negative correlation appears to have different effects
on processing for less emotional than more emotion-laden
decisions. Taken together, these differences in results between less and more emotion-laden decision tasks demonstrate that negative emotion due to the decision task cannot be treated as simply another type of effort cost.
Emotional decision costs appear to have an additional
motivational component that leads to avoidant behaviors.
Second, we have argued that trade-off difficulty plays
a crucial role in the degree to which a choice is viewed
as emotion laden and can affect processing and choice;
however, we have not yet examined the nature of tradeoff difficulty. The traditional view of trade-offs is that
‘‘a trade-off was a trade-off was a trade-off ’’ (Tetlock,
Peterson, and Lerner 1996, p. 36). This point of view
assumes that people are willing and able to make tradeoffs among any conflicting attributes and that the only
relevant question is the exchange rate between the attributes. However, Tetlock and his colleagues, along with
others like Baron (1986; Baron and Spranca 1997) and
Beattie and Barlas (1993), have argued that the identity
of the conflicting attributes is in fact very relevant and
that people will find some trade-offs much more difficult
than others. Tetlock (1992; Tetlock et al. 1996) gives
examples of such difficult attributes to trade off using
what he terms ‘‘sacred’’ values (e.g., life, justice, or liberty). People resist putting prices on life or justice, for
example. Baron and Spranca (1997) discuss ‘‘protected’’
attributes, which are attributes that resist trade-offs with
other attributes.
There is some limited evidence in the consumer behavior literature that certain attributes are treated differently than others. In particular, consumers generally
seem to be more resistant to trading off some quality
to get a better price than accepting a higher price to get
better quality ( Blattberg and Wisniewski 1989; Hardie,
Johnson, and Fader 1993; Heath and Chatterjee 1995;
Nowlis and Simonson 1997; Simonson and Tversky
1992 ) . Dhar and Simonson ( 1997 ) also distinguish between situations involving trade-offs between two goals
( e.g., pleasure and health ) and those involving tradeoffs between goals and resources ( e.g., pleasure and
money ) and show that choices vary depending on the
type of trade-off involved.
Although some research has been done on attribute
properties, we believe that much more research is needed.
We believe that attributes differ in fundamental ways with
respect to trade-offs (e.g., some attributes are more sacred
or more laden with potentially severe consequences) and
that research characterizing attribute properties and the
effects of those properties on trade-off difficulty, processing, and choice is extremely important.

Proposition 5.1: Emotion-laden choices are characterized by more extensive, more selective, and more attributebased processing. In general, emotion-laden choices encourage avoidant behaviors.

EVIDENCE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE
CONSUMER CHOICE: CHOICE TASKS
WHERE MAXIMIZING EASE OF
JUSTIFICATION IS RELEVANT
As mentioned earlier, consumers are often not sure how
to trade off one attribute relative to another or which
attribute is more important when confronted with a decision. Shafir et al. (1993) have argued that people often
construct reasons in order to resolve their conflict about
trade-offs, justify a decision to themselves (i.e., increase
their confidence in the decision), and/or justify (explain)
their decision to others. Such a reasons-based view of
choice is clearly consistent with the view of constructive
preferences. In addition, the justification of decisions is
one of the important choice goals in our framework.
Shafir et al. (1993) argue that relationships among options may be perceived to be more compelling reasons or
arguments for choice than deriving overall values for each
option and choosing the option with the best value. For
example, Montgomery (1983) has argued that a dominance relationship between options is easy to justify as a
reason for choice. He suggests that as a consequence
decision makers may restructure problems (e.g., discount
small attribute differences or drop attributes of lesser importance) in order to achieve a dominance relationship.
Other relationships that may provide good reasons are the
best value on the most important attribute or principles
of rational choice such as transitivity.
Of particular interest to consumer research is the fact
that changes in the set of options under consideration
change the relationships among the options and therefore
some of the potential reasons for choosing among the
options. That is, changes in the decision context can alter
the reasons that are salient and, consequently, the choice
made. Research on asymmetric dominance is an excellent
exemplar of such context-dependent preferences based on
relationships among options.
One of the classic assumptions of models of choice is
the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption.
The basic idea behind this assumption is that the ratio of
the choice probabilities for any pair of options does not
change if the composition of the choice set containing
the two is changed. As noted by Meyer and Kahn (1991,
p. 91), the ‘‘central implication is that if a new option is
added to a choice set, the shares of the existing options
will always decrease in direct proportion to the size of
their original shares.’’ A weaker condition than the independence of irrelevant alternatives (and hence one for
which violations are a more serious problem) is regularity,
the notion that adding a new alternative cannot increase

cresas

UC: Con Res

<-----Page 21----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

the probability of choosing a member of the original
choice set.
It is clear that consumers’ choices do not always obey
such assumptions; the composition of a choice set (the
context) does affect choice behavior. As noted above,
for example, asymmetric dominance has the remarkable
effect that adding an asymmetrically dominated option to
the choice set actually increases the choice share of the
dominating alternative, in violation of the principle of
regularity necessary for most probabilistic choice models.
Huber et al. (1982) originally demonstrated this effect,
and Heath and Chatterjee (1995), Huber and Puto
(1983), Mishra, Umesh, and Stem (1993), Simonson
(1989), and Simonson and Tversky (1992) have provided additional demonstrations.
Several alternative explanations have been proposed
for the asymmetric dominance effect, including agenda
effects (Huber et al. 1982), choice simplification by
searching for dominant options (Montgomery 1983), and
the simplicity and artificiality of the stimuli (Ratneshwar,
Shocker, and Stewart 1987; however, see Wedell [1991]
for evidence contradicting this view). Prelec, Wernerfelt,
and Zettelmeyer (1997; see also Wernerfelt 1995) argue
that at least part of the effect is due to the fact that consumers develop inferences about the location of their ideal
points based on the stimuli and their relationships to one
another.
We believe that many causes contribute to asymmetric
dominance effects. However, one explanation that has received strong support is that people use the relationships
among the options as reasons for choice justification: one
can justify the choice of the dominating option more easily
by noting that it is clearly better than the asymmetrically
dominated option (Simonson 1989; Wedell 1991). Recall
that Simonson (1989) found that increased need for justification led to a greater asymmetric dominance effect.
As described above, Tversky and Simonson (1993; Simonson and Tversky 1992) developed a componential
context model accounting for asymmetric dominance and
related context effects with two components: a measure
of the value of each alternative if considered separately
and a measure of the relative advantage of each option
compared to all of the other options in the choice set.
This latter component explains effects such as asymmetric
dominance, since the dominating option has a clear advantage over the asymmetrically dominated option,
whereas the advantages of the nondominated alternative
over the dominating and asymmetrically dominated option are not as clear.
Simonson and Tversky (1992), in a tour de force paper,
demonstrate that the principles of trade-off contrast and
extremeness aversion can be used in their model to explain such context phenomena as local and background
contrast and attraction, compromise, and polarization effects. Trade-off contrast refers to the fact that a given
trade-off can appear more or less favorable depending on
other implied trade-offs in the choice set, and extremeness

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

207

aversion reflects that intermediate options tend to be favored because disadvantages loom larger than advantages
and intermediate options have relatively smaller disadvantages than extreme options.
We have attempted to explain such results above when
presenting our framework. Our basic argument is that for
simple choice problems the relations among the choice
options are both easy to ascertain perceptually and are
likely to be viewed as plausible reasons or justifications
for choice. Indeed, we might push the argument a step
further and assert that situations with simple options
where the relationships among the options are easy to
ascertain are more likely to evoke ease of justification as
a relevant choice goal. Because they can be perceived
with little effort, relationships among options may be used
to make choices in situations with simple options even if
they do not provide good justifications (e.g., for compromise effects, see Simonson [1989]).
As noted above, we believe that relationships among
options will be more difficult to assess if the set of choice
options is large or displayed in such a way that these
relationships are less transparent. We also believe that the
value component of the componential context model is
more relevant to attaining accuracy goals and that the
relative advantage component is more relevant for achieving effort and justification goals. Recall that u is the parameter in the componential context model that is the
weight given to the relative advantage component; that
is, u may capture the degree to which the focus is on
local relationships in a choice set rather than absolute
criteria. Based on the discussion above, we hypothesize
that u will be a function of the relative strength of goals
(with u higher if less weight is placed on accuracy and
more weight is placed on effort and justification), task
size (with u lower the greater the number of options and
attributes), 4 and transparency of the relationships (with
u higher the more transparent the relationships). We believe that research testing such predictions regarding the
componential context model would be very important. In
summary, we assert:
Proposition 6.1: Adding an asymmetrically dominated
alternative to a choice set results in increased choice share
for the dominating alternative. This effect is enhanced under increased need for justification.
Proposition 6.2: Many context effects can be accounted
for by considering the value of each alternative considered
separately and the relative advantage of each option compared to the other available options.

DISCUSSION
We have now presented a framework for constructive
consumer choice and have attempted to review the litera4
Note the parallel to the results in noncomparable choice, where consumers switch to relying more on overall value as the options become
more noncomparable.

ture on consumer decision making in light of that framework. However, there are several issues that still remain.
First, there are some areas of research that we feel we
cannot yet do a good job of explaining within our framework. Second, some broad generalizations about the literature have become apparent that point to large gaps in
our knowledge. Third, we discuss the conditions under
which constructive choices are likely to be adaptive (i.e.,
intelligent, if not optimal, responses to task demands).
Finally, we consider the implications of a constructive
view of consumer choice for measuring preferences, one
of the most crucial applied problems in consumer research.

Findings That Our Framework
Cannot Fully Explain
Two areas of research pose problems for our framework, framing effects and preferences over time. It is
clear that different ways of framing a problem can lead
to different choices (Tversky and Kahneman 1988). For
example, Levin and Gaeth (1988) show that labeling beef
as 75 percent lean results in more favorable evaluations
than referring to it as 25 percent fat, especially before
tasting it. Mellers, Schwartz, and Cooke (1998) suggest
that such framing manipulations influence the salience of
the good and the bad features of outcomes. Different
frames clearly can make gains or losses more salient, and
differential reactions to gains and losses underlie many
framing effects (e.g., Puto 1987; Shiv, Edell, and Payne
1997; Tversky and Kahneman 1981). Thus, frames may
have an emotional component, and we have argued above
that avoidance of losses may help satisfy the goal of
minimizing negative emotion (Luce et al. 1998). More
generally, framing effects suggest that ‘‘people choose,
in effect, between descriptions of options rather than between the options themselves’’ (Tversky 1996, p. 7).
The framework presented in this article can make some
inroads into explaining such effects, arguing that a frame
makes certain aspects both more perceptually salient (involuntary attention) and less effortful to process. In addition, people may fail to transform problems into a single
canonical representation that would avoid framing effects
due to limits on intuitive computation, even in simple
problems (Kahneman and Tversky 1984). People tend to
accept the frame presented in a problem and evaluate
options in terms of the reference point suggested by that
frame, a concept clearly related to the concreteness principle mentioned earlier. The choice goals framework, however, is silent on why losses loom larger than equivalent
gains (loss aversion).
A topic related to research on framing that our framework does not address in sufficient detail is the nature of
problem representations. Our framework tends to consider
problem representations as given by the structure of the
task (see Coupey [1994], and Lynch, Chakravarti, and
Mitra [1991] for exceptions). However, our framework

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

should be extended to address the principles governing
how representations are formed. For example, individuals
may construct representations that minimize cognitive
load, perhaps by using relevant analogies. Depending on
the goodness of the analogy, this can be an efficient solution, although individuals may not consider alternative
representations once they have one that seems reasonable
(Legrenzi et al. 1993). When no appropriate analogy
exists, the consumer must construct a representation. We
speculate that the representation formed will depend on
what is most salient in the choice environment (due to
both voluntary and involuntary attention), but very little
is known about this process.
A second area of research that is problematic for our
model focuses on choices that have consequences over
time. Simonson (1990), for example, shows that whether
one chooses items for future consumption on multiple
occasions by making a combined choice all at one time
or separately on each occasion has a systematic influence
on choices. In particular, choices made all at one time
increase the amount of variety in the choices. Read and
Loewenstein (1995) provide a model and theoretical account of this phenomenon based on time contraction (consumers compress future time intervals when making combined choices and hence overestimate the effect of
satiation) and choice bracketing (combined choices are
framed together as a portfolio, whereas the separate
choices are viewed more independently). As another example of choices over time, Wertenbroch (1998) argues
that consumers exert self-control in consumption by rationing their purchase quantities (e.g., buying only a single pack of cigarettes at a time to help cut down on their
smoking; see Hoch and Loewenstein [1991] for other
work on self-control). Again, some aspects of these results can be understood in terms of our framework, particularly the Wertenbroch results. The consumer appears to
be trading off increased acquisition effort for increased
long-run accuracy. However, there are also trade-offs between long-run and short-run accuracy (i.e., the consumer
wanting a cigarette now but knowing it is bad for him or
her in the long run).
These two areas of research (framing and choice over
time) reveal gaps that our framework still cannot fill. In
both cases, perceptual principles seem involved to some
extent (e.g., diminishing sensitivity to changes and loss
aversion in framing and time contraction in the choices
over time). Thus, research that attempts to buttress the
perceptual aspects of the choice goals framework is
needed.

Some Generalizations from Reviewing
Constructive Consumer Choice
In reviewing the literature on constructive consumer
choice, we have drawn many generalizations about specific topic areas, expressed as the propositions summarized as Appendix B. However, two broader generaliza-

cresas

UC: Con Res

<-----Page 23----->CONSTRUCTIVE CONSUMER CHOICE PROCESSES

tions have also emerged: (1) task differences between
research based on accuracy-effort ideas (e.g., task difficulty issues) and research based on perceptual notions
(e.g., asymmetric dominance and other relationships
among options), and (2) the lack of research on the dynamics of constructive choice.
First, striking task differences became apparent between research based on the accuracy-effort and perceptual approaches. Research based on accuracy-effort
concerns generally considers larger, more complex
problems and focuses more heavily on process than
on outcome. Conversely, research from the perceptual
perspective relies more on small, relatively simple
problems and focuses on outcomes rather than process.
These differences are very understandable; for example, to observe process one must have problems of some
complexity. Otherwise there will be either no process
to observe or the process will be so constrained that it
will be trivial and invariant across conditions. Also,
studies interested in observing process often restrict
information gathering so that each piece of information
examined can be observed ( e.g., by using computerized
information acquisition programs ) . At the other extreme, perceptual studies often make all information
available simultaneously.
We believe that these differences in tasks across types
of studies have major consequences. For example, the
use of simple problems and simultaneous presentation in
perceptual research makes relational aspects much more
salient, hence making context effects and an ease of justification goal more prevalent. Thus, one large gap in the
literature could be addressed by research that attempts to
unconfound the conceptual approach from problem type.
For example, research on context effects could be carried
out with larger, more complex problems. Researchers using a perceptual framework could also attempt to enumerate the types of relational heuristics consumers might use
and try to observe the processes involved in implementing
such heuristics (this would also require more complex
problems). Accuracy-effort researchers, in contrast,
might attempt to analyze relational heuristic properties
and how their usage varies depending on typical accuracyeffort variables such as time pressure, problem size, and
so on.
A second broad generalization that is readily apparent is that there is very little work on choice dynamics.
This is true at two levels. First, there is a need for work
on how the focus of attention changes constructively
over the course of a decision. Verbal protocols taken
during choice processes reveal a complex dynamic
course, with various aspects being noticed, which then
cause shifts in processing, which then lead to different
aspects being noticed, and so on ( see, for example,
Payne et al. 1993, pp. 175 – 176 ) . However, we are not
aware of any research in consumer choice that attempts
to model the detailed, changing focus of attention over
the course of a choice episode. To really understand

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

209

how choice is constructed ‘‘on the fly,’’ analysis at this
level of detail seems necessary. Second, there is little
research on sequences of choices over time. Without
studying such sequences and the interactions among
choices and their outcomes over time, it is difficult to
observe how representations change or how learning
occurs at the process level, for example. Third, people
may have limited ability to predict to-be-experienced
utility ( Kahneman 1994 ) . Consequently, people may
seek to maximize the accuracy of a choice but instead
experience later disappointment or regret due to a failure to consider how their tastes might change over time.
Hence, a second broad gap in research is studying various facets of choice dynamics.

When Will Constructive Choice Be Adaptive?
One issue we have not yet addressed is when constructive choices will be adaptive. Although being adaptive is
hard to define, we generally mean making intelligent, if
not necessarily optimal, choices. We believe that consumers are often adaptive in the above sense but that such
adaptivity is not universal. There is some evidence, for
example, that consumers’ responses to time pressure are
adaptive. However, many factors can lead to failures in
adaptivity, including lack of knowledge of appropriate
strategies, difficulties in assessing properties of the choice
task, overreliance on the most salient factors in the task
environment, overgeneralization of heuristic strategies,
and difficulties in implementing strategies. We also believe that certain kinds of failures are more likely than
others. For example, overreliance on the most salient surface properties of the task can be particularly problematic
if such properties capture consumers’ attention but are
not related to consumers’ underlying values. In such a
case, choices will likely not be adaptive. As a broad generalization, we believe lack of adaptivity is often more prevalent in studies based on perceptual notions, partly because such studies enhance perceptual salience and are
often designed to specifically document biases in choice.
It is clear, however, that much more research is needed
on the extent and determinants of consumer adaptivity.
One major problem in conducting such research will be
to develop defensible measures for the goodness of a
consumer’s choice.

Assessment of Preferences
in a Constructive World
In a constructive world, preferences differ depending
on a wide variety of factors, as reviewed above. What
does this imply for the assessment of preferences,
which is a major focus of market research? We believe
that the answer to this question depends on the goal of
the analyst. One possible goal is that the analyst wishes
to be able to predict the consumer’s preferences in order

cresas

UC: Con Res

<-----Page 24----->JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

210

to be able to predict market response. Context matching
is the recommended approach for prediction purposes.
In implementing context matching, the analyst attempts
to determine the relevant factors that might influence
preferences in the consumer’s environment and then
match the values of those factors in the measurement
environment ( Simmons, Bickart, and Lynch 1993;
Wright and Kriewall 1980 ) . For example, such factors
as the number of options and attributes, the context
provided by competing options, interattribute correlations, time pressure, response mode, and others can
affect choices. The environment in which preferences
are elicited should try to approximate the consumer’s
environment on all of these factors, particularly if the
consumer has little familiarity with the decision. Context matching thus demands a thorough knowledge of
the properties of consumer choice environments. In
some cases, factors may differ systematically across
environments ( e.g., the set of available options may
vary from store to store or from region to region ) . In
that case, measurements may need to be taken for each
of the major variants of the choice environment and
then aggregated based on the relative frequency of these
variants. Thus, context matching seems appropriate,
even if potentially difficult, for prediction, which may
be the goal in many market research applications.
However, in some situations we may wish to aid
consumers as they construct their preferences ( e.g.,
when measuring values for environmental goods or
when helping a consumer select a college ) . For example, consumers are increasingly being asked to make
choices among or provide values for environmental
goods, such as cleaning up a lake, preventing deaths
of animals, or decreasing levels of pollution. Environmental goods are often unfamiliar and often involve
difficult trade-offs. In such situations we want to help
consumers achieve a ‘‘defensible’’ expression of their
preferences ( Gregory et al. 1993 ) or help them develop
preferences by considering the implications of those
preferences and how to manage them ( e.g., to reduce
regret; Simonson 1992; Slovic 1995 ) . Thus, an important area for future research is developing guidelines
for a good preference construction process and doing
empirical research to document that such guidelines are
indeed effective. Such guidelines might include ensuring consideration of multiple viewpoints and options,
using multiple response modes ( Huber et al. 1993 ) ,
and requiring explicit trade-offs. For an example of
such guidelines, see Payne, Bettman, and Schkade
( 1998 ) .
We have sought to convey the constructive nature of
consumer choice in this article. We have also tried to
communicate an integrated framework for understanding such behavior. Finally, throughout this article we
have attempted to identify gaps requiring future research. These potential research areas are summarized
in Appendix C. We are excited that a broad array of

/ 9h10$$de05

11-16-98 23:10:12

intriguing research opportunities remains, and we believe that understanding consumer decision processes
will continue to be a major focus of consumer behavior
research and theory.

APPENDIX A
Summary Propositions for the Integrated
Conceptual Framework
Proposition 1.1: Consumers make choices in order
to accomplish goals. Four of the most important goals
for consumer decision making are ( a ) maximizing the
accuracy of the choice, ( b ) minimizing the cognitive
effort required to make the choice, ( c ) minimizing the
experience of negative emotion when making the
choice, and ( d ) maximizing the ease of justifying the
decision.
Proposition 1.2: The relative weight placed on various goals will be influenced by a variety of problem
characteristics, including the importance and irreversibility of the decision and the timeliness and ambiguity
of the feedback available on performance relative to
each goal.
Proposition 1.3: Two major influences on the selectivity of attention are current goals (voluntary attention)
and surprising, novel, threatening, unexpected, or otherwise perceptually salient aspects of the choice environment (involuntary attention). Such factors can also affect
the perceptual interpretation of focal aspects of the environment.
Proposition 1.4: Individuals have a repertoire of different strategies for solving decision problems. This repertoire will vary across individuals depending on their
experience and training.
Proposition 1.5: Different strategies vary in their advantages and disadvantages with respect to accomplishing
different goals in a given situation. These relative advantages and disadvantages may be a function of consumers’
skills and knowledge and will vary from one choice environment to another.
Proposition 1.6: Consumers select the strategy that
best meets their goals for a particular situation given the
array of possible strategies and their advantages/disadvantages with respect to these goals.

Comparable versus Noncomparable Choice

APPENDIX B
PROPOSITIONS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE
CONSUMER CHOICE
Choice Tasks Where Accuracy and
Effort Goals Predominate

Proposition 2.8: Processing can differ between comparable and noncomparable choices. Consumers can develop more abstract attributes or compare overall evaluations as choices become more noncomparable. Their use
of these strategies is governed by accuracy-effort concerns. If a specific criterion is primed, however, noncomparable choice processes more closely resemble those for
comparable options.
Response Mode

Problem Difficulty
Problem Size
Proposition 2.1: Increases in the number of alternatives lead to a greater use of noncompensatory choice
strategies. Increases in the number of attributes generally
lead to increased selectivity, but not to strategy changes.
Proposition 2.2: Information load will not be harmful
to accuracy if consumers select a subset of the information
that reflects their values; if selectivity is based on problem
features that do not reflect consumers’ underlying values,
information load can decrease accuracy.
Time Pressure
Proposition 2.3: Under moderate time pressure, consumers process more rapidly and become more selective.
Under more severe time pressure, individuals switch to
more attribute-based heuristics.
Proposition 2.4: Consumers weight negative information more heavily under time pressure.
Attribute Correlation
Proposition 2.5: Consumers engage in processing
more like weighted adding (more extensive, less selective, and more alternative based) under negative interattribute correlation in less emotional decision tasks.
Completeness of Information
Proposition 2.6: Consumers may infer values for a
missing attribute using heuristics based on other-brand
information (other values for that attribute in the set of
options) or same-brand information (values for other attributes of the same brand with the missing value). Which
type of heuristic is used depends on the relative accessibility and diagnosticity of each type of information.
Information Format
Proposition 2.7: Different information formats can
make some forms of processing easier and less effortful
than others. The processing encouraged by the format
will be more likely; however, potential accuracy losses
due to the encouraged form of processing will lessen the
effect of format.

Proposition 3.1: Different response modes (e.g.,
choice vs. matching) can lead to different preferences and
to preference reversals. Choice encourages more selective
and attribute-based comparative processes, whereas rating
or matching encourage less selective, more alternativebased, quantitative processing.
Proposition 3.2: Preference reversals can be reduced by making the more quantitative processing easier, by greater familiarity with the options, and by repeated experience with incentives and feedback on the
task.
Interactions between Consumer Knowledge
and Decision Making
Choice Process and Memory Interactions
Proposition 4.1: Because choice processes are selective and comparative, choice processes influence both
which items are stored in memory and the organization
of such memories. Conversely, information in memory
can affect the form of choice processes.
Proposition 4.2: Consumers will use information in
memory to make a choice to the extent that it is more
accessible and more diagnostic than alternative sources
of information.
Categorization and Choice
Proposition 4.3: Categorical processing is more
likely to be used when expectations are met, with more
detailed (piecemeal) processing more likely when expectations are not met and the consumer has expertise in the
category.

Choice Tasks Where Minimizing Negative
Emotion Is Relevant
Proposition 5.1: Emotion-laden choices are characterized by more extensive, more selective, and more attribute-based processing. In general, emotion-laden choices
encourage avoidant behaviors.

Choice Tasks Where Maximizing Ease
of Justification Is Relevant
Proposition 6.1: Adding an asymmetrically dominated alternative to a choice set results in increased choice

cresas

212

share for the dominating alternative. This effect is enhanced under increased need for justification.
Proposition 6.2: Many context effects can be accounted for by considering the value of each alternative
considered separately and the relative advantage of each
option compared to the other available options.

APPENDIX C

• Examining the use of relational heuristics as a function of task complexity variables.
• Characterizing the determinants of focus of attention
over the course of a decision.
• Studying choice processes over time.
• Examining the extent and determinants of consumer
adaptivity.
• Developing guidelines for preference construction
processes and empirically documenting their effectiveness.

Topics for Future Research on Constructive
Consumer Choice
Research on the Choice Goals Framework
• Specifying factors that determine the relative salience of choice goals.
• Specifying relational heuristics at a process level and
determining their effort-accuracy characteristics.
• Modeling the implementation difficulty of strategies.
• Measuring the degree of emotion during a decision.
• Specifying determinants of the emotional difficulty
of a choice task.
• Examining how problem complexity affects the use
of relationship information as reasons.
• Measuring the justifiability of various strategies.

Research in Choice Tasks Where Accuracy
and Effort Goals Predominate
• Characterizing how consumers become selective as
a function of information load and other factors.
• Examining how the frequency of preference reversals is related to the emphasis on accuracy in the
choice task.
• Characterizing the properties of analogies in terms
of choice goals and examining contingent analogy
usage.

Research in Choice Tasks Where Minimizing
Negative Emotion Is Relevant
• Characterizing attribute properties and their effects
on trade-off difficulty, processing, and choice.

Research in Choice Tasks Where Maximizing Ease
of Justification Is Relevant
• Examining the weight placed on the relative advantage component of the componential context model
as a function of relative goal strength, task size, and
transparency of relationships.

Other Gaps in the Literature
• Addressing the principles governing the formation
of representations.
• Using more complex problems and process tracing
in perceptual framework research.
