Is probability matching smart?
Associations between probabilistic choices
and cognitive ability

In three experiments involving over 1,500 university students (n 5 1,557) and two different probabilistic choice tasks, we found that the utility-maximizing strategy of choosing the most probable alternative was not the majority response. In a story problem version of a probabilistic choice task in which
participants chose from among five different strategies, the maximizing response and the probabilitymatching response were each selected by a similar number of students (roughly 35% of the sample selected each). In a more continuous, or trial-by-trial, task, the utility-maximizing response was chosen by
only one half as many students as the probability-matching response. More important, in both versions
of the task, the participants preferring the utility-maximizing response were significantly higher in cognitive ability than were the participants showing a probability-matching tendency. Critiques of the traditional interpretation of probability matching as nonoptimal may well help explain why some humans
are drawn to the nonmaximizing behavior of probability matching, but the traditional heuristics and biases interpretation can most easily accommodate the finding that participants high in computational
ability are more likely to carry out the rule-based cognitive procedures that lead to maximizing behavior.

An important research tradition in the cognitive psychology of reasoning—the heuristics and biases approach—
has firmly established that people’s responses often deviate from the performance considered normative on many
reasoning tasks (for summaries of the large literature, see
Baron, 2000; Dawes, 1998; Evans & Over, 1996; Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Kahneman & Tversky, 2000;
Manktelow, 1999; Shafir & LeBoeuf, 2002; Stanovich,
1999). It has been common for these empirical demonstrations of a gap between descriptive and normative models of reasoning and decision making to be taken as indications that systematic irrationalities characterize human
cognition. However, over the last decade, an alternative interpretation of these findings has been championed by various theorists (Anderson, 1990, 1991; Brase, Cosmides, &
Tooby, 1998; Chater & Oaksford, 2000, 2001; Cosmides

& Tooby, 1992,1994, 1996; Gigerenzer, 1996a; Oaksford
& Chater, 1998, 2001; Rode, Cosmides, Hell, & Tooby,
1999; Todd & Gigerenzer, 2000). They have reinterpreted
the modal response in most of the classic heuristics and
biases experiments as indicating an optimal informationprocessing adaptation on the part of the participants. For
example, Rode et al. (1999) have argued that error in human
probabilistic judgments is more apparent than real.
As an example, consider the probabilistic contingency
experiment, which has many versions in psychology (Fantino & Esfandiari, 2002; Gal & Baron, 1996; Peterson &
Ulehla, 1965; Shanks, Tunney, & McCarthy, 2002; Tversky
& Edwards, 1966). In one version, the participant sits in
front of two lights (one red and one blue) and is told that
he or she is to predict which of the lights will be flashed
on each trial and that there will be several dozen such trials (participants are often paid money for correct predictions). The experimenter has actually programmed the lights
to flash randomly, with the provision that the red light will
flash 70% of the time, and the blue light 30% of the time.
Participants do quickly pick up the fact that the red light is
flashing more, and they predict that it will flash on more
trials than they predict that the blue light will flash. Most
often, they switch back and forth, predicting the red light
roughly 70% of the time and the blue light roughly 30% of
the time. This strategy of probability matching is suboptimal because it ensures that, in this example, the participant
will predict correctly only 58% of the time (.7 3 .7 1 .3 3

.3), as compared with the 70% hit rate achieved by predicting the more likely color on each trial.
An alternative procedure, in the tradition of research
exploring human probability judgments (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1972), involves presenting verbal problems in
which the frequencies of hypothetical outcomes are either
directly given or easily inferable from the outset. Gal and
Baron (1996), for example, asked participants what global
strategy they would use when betting on the most likely
outcome for each roll of a die in a hypothetical game. In
this game, a die with four red faces and two green faces
was to be rolled several times. Approximately two thirds
of college students failed to use the maximizing strategy
of predicting the most probable color for each roll of the
die (Gal & Baron, 1996).
Although the response of probability matching has been
viewed as irrational in the heuristics and biases literature
(see Fiorina, 1971; Gal & Baron, 1996; Shanks et al., 2002),
this response pattern has been defended for a variety of
reasons ranging from evolutionary concerns to concerns
that the normative models being applied to the task are
wrong (e.g., Cooper, 1989; Cooper & Kaplan, 1982; Fiorina, 1971; Gigerenzer, 1996b; Keren & Wagenaar, 1985;
Rode et al., 1999; Skyrms, 1996).
One aspect of performance that has not received enough
attention in these debates about response patterns in the
heuristics and biases literature has been individual differences. We have previously demonstrated (e.g., Stanovich,
1999; Stanovich & West, 1998a, 1999, 2000) that the nature of these individual differences and their patterns of
covariance might have implications for explanations of
why human behavior often departs from normative models. With respect to several other effects in the heuristics
and biases literature (e.g., the conjunction fallacy, selection task performance, or belief bias effects), we have previously observed that the modal response on the task was
not the response given by those of higher cognitive ability
(i.e., participants closer to the modal response were lower,
rather than higher, in cognitive ability). We have argued that
debates about which responses are optimal or prescriptive
on probabilistic reasoning tasks might be leavened by a
more detailed knowledge of just who was making which
response and of how these people responded on other indicators of cognitive functioning. For example, it might be
assumed that the responses of organisms with fewer algorithmic limitations would be closer to the prescriptive response because the optimal strategy is computationally
more complex and only those with the requisite computational power are able to compute it. Alternatively, the optimal strategy might not be more computationally complex, but its greater eff iciency might be more readily
recognized as such by those with more intelligence. Either
way, we might expect individual differences in cognitive
capacity to predict differential responding—a trend that
has been observed on other heuristics and biases tasks
(Byrnes & Overton, 1986; Jepson, Krantz, & Nisbett,
1983; Stanovich & West, 1998a, 2000).
Theorists in the heuristics and biases camp are largely
committed to this prediction because they often explain

divergences between normative models and actual performance by claiming that limitations in computational capacity prevent the normative response. When the modal response is not normative under their interpretation, we would
expect the more intelligent participants to disproportionately
give the nonmodal response (a trend that has sometimes,
but not always, been obtained; Stanovich & West, 2000).
In three experiments, we examined whether the probability-matching response in probabilistic choice tasks is
an example of a modal response not chosen by the most
intelligent individuals. The first two experiments used a
probabilistic choice task adapted from the die problem of
Gal and Baron (1996), described above. In Experiment 1,
the participants were asked to identify the global strategy
they would use in trying to maximize their winnings when
predicting the outcome of each roll of a hypothetical die
with four red faces and two green faces. Experiment 2
replicated the method of Experiment 1 and added a measure that probed the beliefs about probabilities of participants choosing different strategies. In contrast to Experiments 1 and 2, which examined holistic or global strategies,
Experiment 3 used a more continuous, or trial-by-trial,
betting task that asked the participants to indicate their
specific predictions for each of 10 cards after a random
shuffle of a hypothetical 10-card deck that contained 7 “a”
and 3 “b” cards. The card task also differed from the die task
in that, although predicting the most probable letter for
each trial was the utility-maximizing strategy and would,
on the average, result in winning the most money, a
matching strategy might appear especially tempting because it offered at least the possibility of predicting the
outcome on more than seven trials. Previous research using
story problems has rarely been used to examine the cognitive characteristics of individuals making differing probabilistic choices. The present research explores how cognitive abilities and beliefs about probabilities differ for
participants making optimal or suboptimal choices in
probabilistic choice tasks.
EXPERIMENT 1
Method

Participants. The participants were 445 undergraduate students
(108 males and 337 females) recruited through an introductory psychology participant pool at a medium-sized state university. Their
mean age was 18.8 years (SD 5 2.2). The majority of these students
were freshmen (267 students) or sophomores (120 students), and almost 90% of them identified themselves as White (398 White, 16
African American, 21 Asian American, and 10 other). The demographics form filled out by the students included questions on their
educational history in mathematics and statistics courses. We constructed a 0- to 4-point scale that assessed the students’ mathematics/
statistics course background. Students received 1 point if they had
taken a statistics course in college (193 students), 1 point if they had
taken a statistics course in high school (80 students), 1 point if they
had taken a mathematics course at the university level (288 students), and 1 point if they had had at least 4 years of high school
mathematics (399 students). The mean score on this mathematics
experience composite was 2.16 (SD 5 0.92).
Cognitive ability measure. Students were asked to indicate their
verbal and mathematical Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores on
the demographics sheet. The mean reported verbal SAT score of the

<-----Page 2----->IS PROBABILITY MATCHING SMART?
students was 589 (SD 5 65), the mean reported mathematical SAT
score was 589 (SD 5 67), and mean total SAT score was 1,178 (SD 5
104). These self-reported scores closely matched the averages for
this institution (582, 587, and 1,169, respectively; James Madison
University Office of Institutional Research, 1999–2000). A further
indication of the validity of such self-reported scores was obtained
by Stanovich and West (1998b), who found that the correlation between a vocabulary test and self-reported SAT total scores (.49) was
quite similar to the .51 correlation between the vocabulary test and
verified total SAT scores in a previous investigation using the same
vocabulary measure (West & Stanovich, 1991). A final indication of
the validity of the SAT self-reports is that the vocabulary test in the
Stanovich and West (1998b) study displayed a higher correlation
with the verbal SAT scores (.61) than with the mathematical SAT
scores (.13). In the experiment that follows, the relationships with verbal SAT and mathematical SAT scores were very similar (there were
no significant interactions with SAT subscale). Thus, the more reliable
total SAT score will be used in most of the analyses to be reported.
Our reliance on the SAT as a measure of cognitive ability is justified by the fact that it loads highly on psychometric g (general intelligence) and that it is strongly associated with working memory—
the quintessential indicator of computational capacity in cognitive
science (Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999; Kyllonen, 1996).
Probabilistic choice task: Dice problem . The probabilistic
choice task used in this investigation was a dice problem adapted
from the work of Gal and Baron (1996). The problem was stated as
follows:
A die with 4 red faces and 2 green faces will be rolled 60 times. Before
each roll you will be asked to predict which color (red or green) will
show up once the die is rolled. You will be given one dollar for each correct prediction. Assume that you want to make as much money as possible. What strategy would you use in order to make as much money as
possible by making the most correct predictions?
Strategy A: Go by intuition, switching when there has been too many of
one color or the other.
Strategy B: Predict the more likely color (red) on most of the rolls but
occasionally, after a long run of reds, predict a green.
Strategy C: Make predictions according to the frequency of occurrence
(4 of 6 for red and 2 of 6 for green). That is, predict twice as many reds
as greens.
Strategy D: Predict the more likely color (red) on all of the 60 rolls.
Strategy E: Predict more red than green, but switching back and forth depending upon “runs” of one color or the other.
Which Strategy is best? ___

Strategy C is the probability-matching (Match) strategy and Strategy D is the maximizing (Max) strategy. Strategy A is in essence an
intuitive strategy that mixes a touch of the gambler’s fallacy with intuition (GF-Intuition). Strategy B recognizes runs, a gambler’s fal-

245

lacy, with almost matching (GF-Almost), and Strategy E more
purely reflects the gambler’s fallacy (GF-Pure).

Results and Discussion
Table 1 displays the strategy choices of the participants
in Experiment 1, along with the mean SAT total scores of
the individuals choosing each strategy. The most popular
strategy choice (n 5 168) was Match. However, a close
second in popularity (n 5 150) was the Max response of
choosing the most probable option on each trial. The other
three strategies, which tend to reflect the gambler’s fallacy,
received fewer choices (combined n 5 127) than did the
two dominant responses.
As the third column of the table indicates, the participants choosing the Max strategy tended to have higher SAT
scores than did the participants choosing one of the other
strategies. An analysis of variance on the SAT scores confirmed this impression by indicating that there was a significant overall effect of strategy [F(4,440) 5 8.08, MSe 5
10,087.33, p , .001]. Students choosing the Max strategy
had higher SAT scores (1,215, SD 5 104) than did those
choosing the Match (1,161, SD 5 95), GF-Almost (1,163,
SD 5 92), GF-Pure (1,147, SD 5 106), and GF-Intuition
(1,151, SD 5 128) strategies. Scheffé post hoc tests indicated that students choosing the Max strategy had significantly higher SAT scores than did those choosing the
Match ( p , .001), GF-Almost ( p , .05), and GF-Pure
( p , .01) strategies (not surprisingly, the difference involving the GF-Intuition strategy did not achieve significance, because only 15 students selected this strategy). As
is apparent in the fourth column of the table, the mathematics experience composite scores of the five strategy
groups were very similar [F(4,440) , 1, MSe 5 0.85,
n.s.]. The fifth column of the table indicates that there
were no appreciable differences between the five strategy
groups in the number of university level statistics course
they had taken [F(4,440) # 1, MSe 5 0.25, n.s.].
Gal and Baron (1996) reported that the Max response
was given more often by male students in their study than
by female students. We replicated this finding [ x 2(4, N 5
445) 5 27.9, p , .001], as is indicated in Table 1. The Max

strategy was chosen by a majority of males in the study
(54%), but only by a minority of the females (27%). Although female students’ total SAT scores (M 5 1,169)
were somewhat lower than those of the male students
(M 5 1,203), this difference did not appear to account for
all of the sex differences observed in strategy. For example, when strategy was converted to a 0/1 variable (Max 5
1, and all other strategies 5 0) and was simultaneously regressed on total SAT score and sex, both variables remained significant predictors of strategy [t(442) 5 5.05,
p , .001, and t(442) 5 4.57, p , .001, respectively]. The
results were essentially similar when the regression was
run using the mathematical SAT score rather than the total
score [t(442) 5 4.50, p , .001, and t(442) 5 4.75, p ,
.001, respectively].
EXPERIMENT 2
Experiment 1 provided another example of the trend
discussed in the introduction: The modal response in the
probabilistic choice task was not the response of the most
cognitively able participants.1 Across the entire sample,
the participants choosing the instrumentally rational Max
response were higher in cognitive ability than were those
choosing the evolutionarily rational Match response. In Experiment 2, we sought to solidify this finding by examining performance with a larger sample size and by probing
the beliefs about probability of people choosing different
strategies. Subsequent to choosing a strategy, the participants responded to a questionnaire that probed various beliefs about the trials and contingencies in the hypothetical
die-throwing situation. In addition, the large sample size
of Experiment 2 gave us a chance to examine the replica-

bility of the rather large and surprising sex difference displayed in the dice problem.
Method

Participants. The participants were 715 undergraduate students
(168 males and 547 females) recruited through an introductory psychology participant pool at a medium-sized state university. None of
these students had participated in Experiment 1. Their mean age was
18.9 years (SD 5 2.1). The majority of these students were freshmen
(394 students) or sophomores (242 students), and almost 90% of
them identified themselves as White (633 White, 20 African American, 40 Asian American, and 22 other). The demographics form
contained the same questions on educational history in mathematics
and statistics courses as in Experiment 1.
Cognitive ability measure. The mean reported verbal SAT score
of the students was 581 (SD 5 65), the mean reported mathematical
SAT score was 585 (SD 5 68), and the mean total SAT score was
1,167 (SD 5 104).
Probabilistic choice task: Dice problem. The dice problem
from Experiment 1 was also used in the present experiment as the
probabilistic choice task.
Probabilistic belief questionnaire. Subsequent to choosing a
strategy in the probabilistic choice task, the participants completed
a seven-item questionnaire that probed various beliefs about the trials and contingencies in the hypothetical die-throwing situation. The
response format for each item was agree strongly (scored as 6),
agree moderately (5), agree slightly (4), disagree slightly (3), disagree moderately (2), and disagree strongly (scored as 1). Students
received the following instructions for this task: “After considering
your choice of the best strategy, how much do you agree or disagree
with the following statements?” The specific questionnaire items are
listed in Table 2.

Results and Discussion
Table 3 displays the strategy choices of the participants
in Experiment 2, along with the mean SAT total scores of
the individuals choosing each strategy. There it can be

1. My method is best because it leaves
more room for intuition to help me. (2.26)
2. After a long run of red, green is more
likely, so after a long run of red I
should switch my prediction to green. (2.22)
3. Because in the long run two thirds of the rolls
will come out red, I should predict red
on two thirds of the 60 rolls. (2.21)
4. Red is more likely to come up on any
one roll, given that there are more red
sides on the die than green. (.22)
5. I should predict red on most rolls, but
randomly predict green on a few others. (2.26)
6. I thought that the outcome of any one
roll of the die is unrelated to the previous rolls. (.13)
7. The method I thought was best is
preferred because in the long run it
could provide a higher gain, although at a higher risk. (2.21)

seen that the most popular strategy choice (n 5 280) was
the Max response of choosing the most probable option
on each trial. However, a close second in popularity (n 5
260) was the Match strategy. As in Experiment 1, the other
three strategies, which tend to reflect the gambler’s fallacy,
received substantially fewer choices (combined n 5 175)
than did the two dominant responses.
As the third column of Table 3 indicates, the participants choosing the Max strategy tended to have higher
SAT scores than did the participants choosing one of the
other strategies. An analysis of variance on the SAT scores
confirmed this impression by indicating that there was a
significant overall effect of strategy [F(4,709) 5 9.91,
MSe 5 10,372.15, p , .001]. The students choosing the
Max strategy had higher SAT scores (1,196, SD 5 103)
than those choosing the Match (1,152, SD 5 100), GFAlmost (1,140, SD 5 114), GF-Pure (1,137, SD 5 92),
and GF-Intuition (1,169, SD 5 84) strategies. Scheffé post
hoc tests indicated that the students choosing the Max
strategy had significantly higher SAT scores than did
those choosing the Match ( p , .001), GF-Almost ( p ,
.01), and GF-Pure ( p , .01) strategies (not surprisingly,
the difference involving the GF-Intuition strategy did not
achieve significance, because only 22 students selected
this strategy). As is apparent in the fourth column of
Table 3, the mathematics experience composite scores of
the five strategy groups were very similar [F(4,709) 5
1.24, MSe 5 0.76, n.s.], as were the number of university
level statistics course they had taken [Table 3, fifth column; F(4,709) 5 1.21, MSe 5 0.25, n.s.].
In Experiment 2, we confirmed the surprising finding
(first demonstrated by Gal & Baron, 1996) that the Max
response was given more often by male participants
[ x 2(4, N 5 715) 5 45.5, p , .001]. The Max strategy was
chosen by a majority of males in the study (60%), but only
by a minority of the females (33%). In contrast, the Match
response was chosen only by a minority of the males in the
study (17%), but the Match response was chosen by a plurality of the females (42%). As in Experiment 1, the female students’ total SAT scores (M 5 1,160) were somewhat lower than those of the male students (M 5 1,187),

but this difference did not account for all of the sex differences observed in strategy choice. When strategy was
converted to a 0/1 variable (Max 5 1, and all other strategies 5 0) and was simultaneously regressed on total SAT
score and sex, both variables remained significant predictors of strategy [t(712) 5 5.56, p , .001, and t(712) 5
5.84, p , .001, respectively]. The results were essentially
similar when the regression was run using the mathematical SAT score, rather than the total score [t(712) 5 5.31,
p , .001, and t(712) 5 5.35, p , .001, respectively].
The participants in Experiment 2 filled out the probabilistic belief questionnaire subsequent to performing the
dice task. Table 2 presents the mean scores on the 6-point
(disagree strongly to agree strongly) scale for each of the
items on this questionnaire as a function of strategy. In that
table, the Match and the Max strategies are compared with
a combined gambler’s fallacy (GF-Comb) strategy that
was formed by combining the set of three strategies that
place an emphasis on the gambler’s fallacy (GF-Intuition,
GF-Almost, and GF-Pure)—that is, switching predictions
on the basis of runs.
The three strategy groups differed significantly on each
of the seven probabilistic belief items [from F(4,709) 5
19.51 (MSe 5 2.01) to 149.05 (MS e 5 1.60); all ps ,
.001]. The students in the GF-Comb group were significantly more likely to agree that intuition was important
(Item 1), that a color would become less likely after a long
run (Item 2), and that it was important to randomly predict
the less likely color on some trials (Item 5). The students
in the Max group were least likely to agree with each of
these three beliefs.
The Match group was significantly more likely to agree
that it was important to match the most probable long-run
outcome pattern (Item 3), whereas the Max group was
least likely to agree with this belief. Although the GFComb and the Match groups did not differ significantly
from each other in their belief that higher gain could be
achieved by sometimes selecting the riskier color (Item 7),
the students in both of these groups were significantly
more likely to agree with this item than were the students
in the Max group (Scheffé post hoc test, both ps , .001).

WEST AND STANOVICH

Over 95% of the students in each of the three strategy
groups agreed to various degrees (agree slightly to agree
strongly) that red was the more likely outcome of any one
roll (Item 4), but the Max group was significantly firmer
in this belief. Over 70% of the students in each strategy
group agreed to various degrees that the outcome of any
roll of the die was independent of the previous rolls
(Item 6), but again, the students in the Max group were
significantly stronger in their affirmation. In fact, in contrast to both the GF-Comb and the Match groups, the only
beliefs strongly endorsed by the Max group were those
that emphasized the higher probability of red on each independent roll of the die (Items 4 and 6).2
EXPERIMENT 3
Although in Experiment 2 slightly more participants selected the normative Max response over the Match response (n 5 280 vs. 260), the Max responders constituted
only 39% of the total sample. The gambler’s fallacy responses—particularly Strategy B and Strategy E, it should
be noted—also suggest a Match rather than a Max strategy. Although only a minority of the participants chose
the Max strategy, those that did displayed higher SAT
scores.
Before elaborating our interpretation of these results,
we will report a third experiment, in which we examined
the generality of the patterns observed in probabilistic
choice tasks. The paradigm for probabilistic choice that
we employed in the first two experiments involved a story
problem with a holistic, or global, strategy choice. Following the task used by Gal and Baron (1996), the participants in Experiments 1 and 2 were asked to indicate
which single global strategy they would use in predicting
the color of each of 60 rolls of a die that had four red faces
and two green faces. In Experiment 3, we employed a
more continuous, or trial-by-trial, task that asked the participants to indicate what their specific prediction would
be for each of 10 cards after a random shuffle of a 10-card
deck that contained 7 cards with the letter “a” and 3 cards
with the letter “b” on the down side. Although the Max
strategy of selecting “a” for each card is the optimal strategy with a fixed hit rate of 70% and the Match strategy
would result in an average hit rate of only 58%, the latter
strategy may appear additionally tempting because it offers the possibility of predicting the outcome on more than
seven trials. We were interested in whether the patterns of
individual differences in cognitive ability (and the sex difference) would replicate in a paradigm with quite different cognitive processing requirements.
Method
Participants
The participants were 422 undergraduate students (173 males and
249 females) recruited through an introductory psychology participant pool at a medium-sized state university. None of these students
had participated in Experiment 1 or 2. Their mean age was 19.1 years
(SD 5 1.8). The majority of these students were freshmen (272 students) or sophomores (109 students), and almost 90% of them iden-

tified themselves as White (368 White, 10 African American, 32 Asian
American, and 12 other). The demographics form contained the
same questions on educational history in mathematics and statistics
courses as in Experiment 1.
Cognitive ability measure. The students were asked to indicate
their verbal and mathematical SAT scores on the demographics
sheet. The mean self-reported verbal SAT score of the students was
581 (SD 5 78), the mean reported mathematical SAT score was 594
(SD 5 69), and the mean total SAT score was 1,174 (SD 5 105).
Probabilistic choice task:Trial-by-trial task. The probabilistic
choice task asked the participants to indicate what their specific prediction would be for each of 10 cards following a random shuffle of
a 10-card deck that contained 7 cards with the letter “a” and 3 cards with
the letter “b” on the down side. The problem was stated as follows:
Card Guessing Game
A card deck has only 10 cards:
7 of the cards have the letter “a” on the down side.
3 of the cards have the letter “b” on the down side.
The 10 cards are randomly shuffled.
Your task is to guess the letter on the down side of each card before it is
turned over. Pretend that you will win $100 for each card’s down side letter you correctly predict. Indicate your predictions for each of the 10 cards:
1.
Card #1 will be a or b?
2.
Card #2 will be a or b?
3.
Card #3 will be a or b?
4.
Card #4 will be a or b?
5.
Card #5 will be a or b?
6.
Card #6 will be a or b?
7.
Card #7 will be a or b?
8.
Card #8 will be a or b?
9.
Card #9 will be a or b?
10.
Card #10 will be a or b?

The students who predicted any combination of 7 “a” cards and 3
“b” cards used the Match strategy, and the students who predicted
“a” for each of the 10 cards used the Max strategy. Strategies other
than Match and Max were used very rarely with this paradigm and
were dropped from the analyses that follow (only 5.9% of the sample gave a pattern other than Max or Match: 7 students selected “b”
for 1 or 2 of the cards, and 18 students selected “b” on more than 3
of the cards). The remaining sample contained 397 students.

Results and Discussion
Table 4 displays the strategy choices of the participants
in Experiment 3, along with the mean SAT total scores of
the individuals choosing between the Match and the Max
strategies. The Match strategy for the trial-by-trial card task
was preferred by about two thirds of the students (n 5
264). In contrast, the Max strategy of choosing the most
probable option on each trial was preferred by only about
a third of the students (n 5 133). As the third column of
Table 4 indicates, the participants choosing the Max strategy tended to have significantly higher SAT scores (1,202,
SD 5 104) than did the participants choosing the Match
strategy [1,163, SD 5 102; t(395) 5 3.57, p , .001]. The
mathematics experience composite scores of the two strategy groups were very similar [t(395) 5 20.83, n.s.], and
there were no appreciable differences between the two
strategy groups in the number of university level statistics
course they had taken [two-tailed t(395) 5 20.28, n.s.].
Once again, the Max response was given more often by
the male students than by the female students [ x 2(1, N 5
397) 5 6.40, p , .05], as is indicated in the second row of
Table 4. The Max strategy was chosen by 41% of the males,
but only by 28% of the females. As in Experiments 1 and

2, female students’ total SAT scores (M 5 1,164) were
somewhat lower than those of the male students (M 5
1,192), but this difference did not appear to account for
all of the sex differences observed in strategy. When strategy was converted to a 0/1 variable (Match 5 0, Max 5
1) and was simultaneously regressed on total SAT score
and sex, both variables remained significant predictors of
strategy [t(394) 5 3.29, p , .005, and t(394) 5 2.13, p 5
.034, respectively]. The results were essentially similar
when the regression was run using the mathematical SAT
score rather than the total score [t(394) 5 3.68, p , .001,
and t(394) 5 2.04, p 5 .042, respectively].3
GENERAL DISCUSSIO N
In three different experiments utilizing two different
probabilistic choice paradigms, we observed that the Max
response in both tasks was the choice of the most cognitively able participants. This was despite the fact that the
nonmaximizing Match response tended to be the modal
response. On the trial-by-trial version of the task (Experiment 3), it was by far the dominant response. It was chosen by a plurality of the participants in Experiment 1 and
was at least equal in magnitude to the Max strategy in Experiment 2 (recall that several of the GF strategy choices
incorporate matching components).
This pattern—the modal response on the task being the
response given by those of lower cognitive ability—is not
without precedent (Jepson et al., 1983; Stanovich & West,
1998a, 2000). We interpret the pattern in this experiment
and others (e.g., Stanovich, 1999) as consistent with assumptions behind the heuristics and biases framework
(e.g., Gilovich, Griffin, & Kahneman, 2002; Kahneman
& Frederick, 2002; Kahneman et al., 1982) that the default processing strategy of most participants is a nonnormative cognitive shortcut that does not stress cognitive capacity. Participants who, on an individual difference analysis,
are higher in cognitive capacity are less likely to make use
of this cognitive shortcut. In situations like the probabilistic choice tasks used here—where the heuristic primes a
nonnormative response—high analytic intelligence will
be more strongly associated with the instrumentally rational response.4
The results from the probabilistic belief questionnaire
employed in Experiment 2 provided strong evidence that

the Max strategy group held beliefs about the implications
of the probabilistic processes that were remarkably different from those held by the two other groups. The GF-Comb
group strongly endorsed the importance of using intuition,
making some random or risky choices, and avoiding long
runs or streaks of one color. The Match group tended to be
somewhat more restrained in their endorsement of these
beliefs, while at the same time very strongly endorsing the
view that the most optimal pattern of choices needed to
match the most likely long-run pattern. The strategies of
both the GF-Comb and the Match groups appear to have
been strongly influenced by their knowledge that, although red may have been the more likely outcome of any
specific roll of the die, a generally mixed pattern of red
and green was still the most likely, or representative (see
Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Kahneman & Tversky,
1972), long-run outcome. The GF-Comb group appeared
to be focused primarily on avoiding runs or streaks, whereas
the Match group appeared to be focused primarily on what
the most likely global pattern of results would generally
look like. In contrast to both the GF-Comb and the Match
groups, the only beliefs strongly endorsed by the Max
group were those that emphasized the higher probability
of red on each independent roll of the die (see Items 4 and
6 in Table 2).
Replicating the earlier finding of Gal and Baron (1996),
we found that the male participants in each of our three experiments were significantly more likely to select the normative Max strategy than were the female participants.
The male participants in Experiment 2 were also less
likely than the female participants to endorse beliefs consistent with the gambler’s fallacy. A portion of this male/
female difference was accounted for by differences in cognitive ability, but a significant proportion of the variance
in strategy selection was independently associated with
sex in each of the three experiments. Evolutionary ideas in
foraging and sexual selection theory that may be relevant
to explaining the difference (see Geary, 1996) are beyond
the scope of what can be adjudicated with the present data,
but the literature on sex differences in mathematical ability may be relevant. Males, for example, are often found
to perform somewhat better on mathematical reasoning
tasks, whereas females are often found to perform somewhat better on mathematical calculation tasks (e.g., Geary,
1996; Kimura, 1999; but see Chipman, 1996). Although

<-----Page 7----->250

our data contribute empirically to the description of this
sex difference, we remain theoretically agnostic with respect to the origin of these differences.

NOTES
1. Strictly speaking, this was true for females only, since only for this
subgroup was the Match strategy the modal choice.
2. These were the only two questionnaire items for which the female
students’ mean agreement scores were not significantly higher than
those of the male students [Items 4 and 6, respectively; two-tailed

<-----Page 8----->IS PROBABILITY MATCHING SMART?
t(713) 5 1.84, p 5 .066, and t(713) 5 1.48, p 5 .138; Items 1, 2, 3, 5,
and 7, all two-tailed t(713) 5 23.20 to 26.12; all ps 5 .0014 to ,.0001].
This pattern is consistent with the weaker tendency toward the Max strategy in females.
3. We assumed that the participants would construe the task in Experiment 3 as one in which they were to make predictions with no knowledge
of which letters had actually been on the down sides of previous cards. An
insightful reviewer pointed out that our directions were somewhat ambiguous and that the participants might have construed the task as one in
which the outcomes of previous predictions were revealed (i.e., imagined)
prior to subsequent predictions. Under this alternative construal, if several “a” cards had already been revealed, the probability of a “b” might
exceed that for an “a” and become optimal. The viability of this alternative construal was explored by examination of data from the first 4 cards,
since “a” was always optimal under both construals for the first 4 cards.
An examination of these data indicated that very few participants (3.3%)
predicted the low probability letter “b” for Card 1. More important, contrary to the implications of the suggested alternative construal, the lowprobability “b” was predicted more often for Card 3 (34.0%) than for
any of the other 9 cards. Furthermore, the total number of “b” predictions
for Cards 2–4 did not differ from the total number of “b” predictions for
Cards 8–10 [t(396) 5 1.05, n.s.]. Finally, when data from only the first
4 cards were analyzed, the pattern of SAT findings was essentially identical to the pattern reported in Table 4 with all 10 cards. Thus, the evi-

251

dence unambiguously supports the view that the participants construed
this task as we had intended and that “a” was always the optimal choice.

4. It should be noted that the range restriction in analytic intelligence
of our university sample may have attenuated the magnitude of this
association. Many of our participants had had at least minimal exposure to probability theory and notions of randomness in previous math
and/or statistic courses, and the extent to which our findings can be
generalized to populations without these educational experiences remains largely unexplored. Although there have been relatively few
studies with noncollege students in which story-type probabilistic
choice tasks have been used, some evidence suggests that increasing
age and cognitive ability are associated with increased normative behavior in children on such tasks. For example, Gal and Baron (1996)
studied a small sample of sixth- and ninth-grade children with a version of the die task and observed a nearly universal Match strategy.
Kokis, Macpherson, Toplak, West, and Stanovich (2002) used a very
different type of probabilistic reasoning task with 10- to 13-year-old
children and found that the children who made optimal probabilistic decisions had significantly higher scores on a measure of cognitive ability than did children who made suboptimal decisions.
