resource endowments affect the likelihood of three critical outcomes: that new ventures
attract venture capital financing, experience initial public offerings, and fail. Our analysis
focuses on the role of founders' social capital as a determinant of these outcomes. Event history analyses show that new ventures with founders having direct and indirect relationships
with venture investors are most likely to receive venture funding and are less likely to fail.
In turn, receiving venture funding is the single most important determinant of the likelihood
of IPO. We conclude that the social capital of company founders represents an important
endowment for early-stage organizations.

Introduction
At inception, founders endow the organizations they
create with certain resources. In this article, we ask:
How do initial resource endowments affect the performance of new ventures? A number of organizational
theorists have posited that initial resource stocks
may have enduring effects on organizational performance (Stinchcombe 1965, Baron et al. 1996, Hannan
1998), perhaps evincing a positive feedback dynamic
in the resource accumulation process in which initial advantages amplify over time. Other researchers
have challenged this view, asserting that resource
the advantages they engenderendowments-and
often dissipate quickly (Bruderl and Schussler 1990,
Fichman and Levinthal 1991).
The debate about the influence of initial resource
endowments on organizational life chances has continued because systematic evidence on the subject
has been elusive. One reason for this is the difficulty

researchers have encountered in obtaining the information needed to explore endowment effects. The
most significant obstacle has been that the study of
initial endowments cannot proceed without detailed
information on the earliest days of an organization's
existence. Unfortunately, new organizations often fail
before they are recognized in industry directories and
by the popular press, which means that there are few
data sets describing initial resource endowments in
nonselected samples. As a result, inferences regarding
the effects of endowments on organizational performance have, for the most part, been drawn from analyses of indirect relationships, such as the pattern of
age dependence apparent in studies of organizational
failure rates.
In this article, we analyze a unique data archive
describing the life histories of 134 high technology
firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned inventions
during the period from 1980 to 1996. The start-ups in

this population were founded specifically to commercialize technologies licensed from MIT. In addition
to documenting the date of founding in a complete
and nonselected organizational population, these data
also include archival records and in-depth interviews
with company founders. The data describe (i) whether
company founders had (pre-existing) social relations
with venture investors at the time they launched the
new company, (ii) the prior industry and start-up
experience of company founders, (iii) the technological assets of the company at founding, and (iv) characteristics of the industries that the new ventures
entered. We also collected event histories describing the performance milestones achieved by each
firm. Therefore, our analyses enable comparisons of
the relative influences of social capital, human capital, technological resources, and market conditions at
founding on the subsequent performance of new technology firms.
Because extant studies have established that organizational outcomes are affected by new ventures'
human capital endowments (Bruderl et al. 1992), their
stocks of technical assets (Stuart et al. 1999), and
the environmental and market conditions at the time
of founding (Hannan and Carroll 1992), we concentrate on the relationships between founders' social
capital at the time of founding and later-life outcomes. An additional reason for this focus is that
the organization building process is hampered by
widespread information problems that make it likely
that founders' social capital influences new venture
performance, particularly in the case of technologybased ventures. Therefore, we concentrate the theoretical development on the social capital argument,
but our analytical strategy will treat the relative influence of the endowments of these four categories of
resources on organizational outcomes as an empirical question to be unraveled in the analysis. Moreover, we perceive the contribution of this article to
lie in the evidence linking different types of resource
endowments to organizations' critical, early-stage performance milestones.

Founders' Social Capital and
Resource Acquisition

Creating new organizations involves allocating
resources to novel uses. But because the entrepreneurs
who discover opportunities for new ventures often do
not control the resources needed to pursue them, they
must enlist the patronage of outside investors. The
founders of early-stage ventures vary in their ability
to obtain the support of resource holders, and this
variance likely has a salient effect on venture performance (Aldrich and Zimmer 1986, Stuart et al. 1999,
Stuart 2000). The conjecture we explore here is that
entrepreneurs' social capital contributes to new venture performance, in large part because of its effect on
founders' ability to secure external financing to pursue the opportunities they discover.
A resource holder's decision to support an
entrepreneurial enterprise depends on his or her
appraisal of the attractiveness of the opportunity
identified by an entrepreneur.1 However, researchers
in the areas of finance, economic sociology, transaction costs economics, and entrepreneurship have
observed that a set of uncertainties and information asymmetries encumber the evaluation of new
ventures and complicate the process of contracting
between resource holders and new ventures. The contention that we make is that the presence of these
factors elevates the significance of the social capital of
the founding team as a basis for making investment
decisions.
Uncertainty about the quality of start-ups in part
arises from the simple fact that young companies
have very short performance track records, and thus
do not lend observable histories to the task of evaluating their quality. Stated differently, the information
that resource providers would ideally use to assess
a venture's quality is not observable until after the
entrepreneur has obtained resources, established a
1Throughoutthe article,we will use the terms "resourceholder"
and "investor"as synonyms. Although we develop the social capital argumentspecificallyin terms of the decision of the suppliers
of financing to invest in an early-stageventure, the argument is
qualitativelygeneralizableto the case of a potential supplier's or
customer'sdecision to transactwith a new organizationor a potential employee to work for a particularstartup.

functioning organization, and started down the path
of developing products (Arrow 1974).
Uncertainty about the future prospects of young
organizations is likely to be particularly high among
those enterprises established to commercialize new
technologies (Aldrich and Fiol 1994). Technology
companies may require large resource commitments
to conduct exploratory development projects, and
hoped-for revenues and profits often lie far in
the future. Moreover, new technology is intrinsically unpredictable. Emerging markets progress along
unforeseeable paths, incompatible technologies compete for market acceptance, and technical roadblocks
routinely derail once promising development projects
(Tushman and Rosenkopf 1992). For these reasons, a
lengthy time period and large resource outlays may
stand between an early-stage technology company
and the resolution of the uncertainty about its longterm viability. Thus, the quality of embryonic technology companies, the magnitude of the underlying
market opportunities that venture founders wish to
exploit, and the level and duration of the investment
required to nurture early-stage companies elude precise delineation in ex ante evaluations.
Information asymmetries also obscure evaluations
of new ventures. Relative to outside evaluators,
entrepreneurs are privy to more information about
the prospects of their ventures and the abilities and
level of commitment of the founding team. This
increases the risk borne by investors in new companies because entrepreneurs may exploit their superior knowledge of their company's position to gain
concessions from investors, for example, by extracting a higher valuation or larger resource commitment than a fully (or more) informed investor would
provide. Like the level of uncertainty, information
asymmetries may be particularly acute in the case of
early-stage technology companies. In these instances,
firm founders are often the leading experts in the
relevant area of technology, and therefore are the
best informed about the feasibility of a proposed
technology.
Prior research identifies two types of responses
from resource holders when the decision to invest
is complicated by the presence of uncertainty and
information imbalances. The economics literature

156

emphasizes the design of contracts-particularly
the allocation of control rights between trading
partners-that minimize agents' capacities to behave
opportunistically vis-a-vis their transaction partners
when one party in a deal has more information than
the other and unforeseeable contingencies obfuscate
the future terms of the relationship (Gompers and
Lerner 1999, Kaplan and Stromberg 1999).2
However, contractual controls rarely succeed at
fully eliminating the entrepreneur's ability or incentive to take actions that conflict with the interests of
outside investors (Venkataraman 1997, Arrow 1974).
Moreover, when there is high uncertainty about how
an early-stage business might evolve, it is very difficult to design contracts that attend to all possible, future contingencies that might impact the
terms of the relationship between entrepreneurs and
their investors. As a result, the agreements between
entrepreneurs and investors are often subject to expost opportunism (Williamson 1975).
Whereas the economics literature has focused on
how formal contracts and the allocation of control rights between the parties in an exchange can
minimize transactional risks under conditions of
uncertainty and information asymmetry, the sociological literature on the subject has emphasized the
implications of these conditions for the selection of
exchange partners. Sociologists observe that when the
circumstances surrounding a transaction preclude an
actor from entering a relationship without the risk
that his partner will behave opportunistically, he often
chooses to conduct business only with exchange partners he knows (Macaulay 1963, Granovetter 1985,
Bradach and Eccles 1989, Coleman 1990, Stuart and
Robinson 2000).
The sociological argument distills to the contention
that actors rely on social networks to select transaction partners who they believe will behave reliably,
even when a partner is not contractually obligated
to do so. In general, networks serve two functions

that facilitate, respectively, the enforcement of implicit
contracts and the selection of reliable partners. First,
the network is a mechanism for sanctioning actors
who behave opportunistically; second, it delineates
the pathways through which information is relayed
about its members. Because information about actors'
conduct in previous transactions diffuses through the
connections in a network, actors will know of the
past behavior of the other members of the network
within their information spheres, and they will have
the power to sanction their transaction partners by
disseminating negative information about them in the
event of malfeasant behavior (Granovetter 1985, Raub
and Weesie 1990).
These functions of the network may influence
the resource holder's decision to support the
entrepreneur. When an investor evaluates a new
venture, she produces estimates of the expected
value of the investment under different scenarios.
Because opportunistic behavior on the part of the
entrepreneur reduces the expected payoff from the
investment, investors will be less likely to finance
projects in which they question the reliability of the
entrepreneur. Ceteris paribus, as the probability that
an exchange partner will behave opportunistically
declines, the expected value of transacting with that
partner increases.
One of the more robust findings in the literature
on intercorporate and interpersonal relations is that
actors with established trading histories are likely
to trust one another. This is because past partners
are of known character, and the counterparties in
an ongoing relationship have an incentive to behave
with good faith to preserve the health of the relationship for future exchanges. Further, a history of
past exchanges often produces feelings of obligation
between exchange partners, in part because the relationship may double as a friendship. We therefore
posit, new ventures with founding teams that have preestablished relationships with venture investors are more
likely to acquireexternalfunding for their ventures.
Just as a history of direct exchange reduces the perceived threat that a partner will behave opportunistically, indirect ties between two parties may facilitate
exchange by increasing the level of trust in the relationship. When ties to a mutual third party link two

actors, the third party may play the role of "intermediary in trust" (cf. Coleman 1990). In this situation, the
relationship between would-be trustor and trustee is
facilitated when the trusting party has confidence in
the advisor's judgment, who, in turn, has confidence
in the ability of the trustee.3 In effect, the intermediary
certifies the counterparties in a potential transaction
by relaying subject evaluations about qualities like an
actor's reliability. This process suggests that new ventures with founding teams that have pre-establishedrelationships with third parties who are connected to venture
investors are more likely to acquire external funding for
their ventures.
There is one additional factor that may reinforce
the role of direct and indirect ties in increasing the
likelihood of an investment: Ties between investors
and entrepreneurs may also affect investors' assessments of the quality of the entrepreneur's project
when uncertainty is high (e.g., when the new venture
aims to develop an unproven technology). By definition, uncertainty increases the problem of identifying
quality. As the task of assessing competence becomes
increasingly imprecise, evaluators' appraisals of quality are opened to the influence of indirect signals, such
as the social status of the actors under scrutiny and
the prestige of their affiliates (Podolny 1994, Stuart
et al. 1999). To the extent that the social structural
proximity of other actors becomes a basis for making quality inferences, the estimates of the potential
value of an investment opportunity, in addition to
expectations of the trustworthiness of entrepreneurs
who propose the project, are also positively influenced when a potential investor and entrepreneur
are near in social space. Consistent with this view,
Wilson (1985) emphasizes the importance of referrals
3 In this case, the advisor's incentivesare linked to the credibilityof
his advice. If his advice proves incorrect,he loses the confidenceof
those he has advised, and his position as a trustedintermediaryis
compromised.Thereare a number of perspectiveson the interests
of the intermediaryin three party systems, most of which build
from Simmel's (1950)analysis of triad structures.For example, in
Blau's (1964) exchange theory, advice is exchanged for deference
and thus the intermediary'sincentivesare also linked to the accrual
of status. Burt's (1992) discussion of the tertiusrole stresses that
intermediariescan extract"profit"by brokeringthe directrelationship between two disconnectedparties.

to signal quality to venture capitalists, as does a survey performed by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984).

Endowments: A Shadow
Over the Future
The preceding section outlined arguments for why we
expect new ventures with founders who are within
the social circles of venture investors to be advantaged in the resource acquisition process. Before presenting the empirical analysis, we return briefly to the
question of how long this and similar initial advantages are likely to persist. Although the notion of
a "liability of adolescence," in which organizational
mortality rates increase as new ventures deplete their
initial resource endowments, has found some empirical substantiation in the ecology literature (Bruderl
and Schussler 1990, Fichman and Levinthal 1991), others argue that early resource endowments set a new
venture on the path toward the establishment of longterm, robust positions (cf. Hannan 1998).
In support of Stinchcombe's (1965) imprinting argument, a number of recent papers exploring the evolution of technology companies have produced some
of the strongest evidence yet that the early decisions made by organizations persist for considerable
periods of time (Sorensen and Stuart 2000, Baron
et al. 2001). To the extent that endowment levels
directly constrain organizational decision making, the
level of initial resource endowments may position
organizations on different developmental trajectories.
For example, a lack of resources at founding might
compel an organization to adopt a set of decision
rules aimed at cost minimization, such as "buying
cheap materials" or "avoiding high salary employees"
(Swaminathan 1996, Burderl et al. 1992). A resource
shortage may also discourage employees from investing in organization-specific skills because they are
doubtful of their employer's viability and thus their
ability to recoup investments in firm-specific knowledge (Swaminathan 1996). Similarly, resource-poor
start-ups may have weak bargaining positions with
their customers and suppliers (Stinchcombe 1965).
This can be a particularly severe disadvantage in high
technology industries, where a lack of resources may
158

force young firms to cede to alliance partners significant rights to future products and technologies in
exchange for assistance in supporting a research program (cf. Lerner and Tsai 1999).
All of these factors combine to suggest that new
ventures lacking initial resource endowments might
develop inferior structures, internal processes, and
human resources relative to their competitors, and
thus may develop a reputation for low quality that
can be extremely difficult to escape. We therefore
believe that initial resource endowments are likely
to be parlayed into sustainable advantage, and we
present suggestive evidence to this effect.

Methodology
Sample and Data Sources
The data set we analyze includes the population of
134 firms founded to exploit inventions assigned to
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology between
1980 and 1994.4 Like many other research universities, the institute often takes title to commercially useful inventions that are developed by faculty, staff, or
students and that emerge from work making material use of MIT resources (e.g., laboratory facilities).
MIT then attempts to commercialize some of these
discoveries. The study population was identified from
the records of the MIT Technology Licensing Office
(TLO), to which we were permitted access to perform
this analysis. The TLO's mission is to commercialize
MIT technology. Although many of the enterprises
licensing MIT's intellectual property are established
companies, a subset of these licensees includes new
ventures founded to develop the institute's technology. We examine these entities here.
The TLO archives describe the contracts between
MIT and its licensees, characteristics of the licensed
intellectual property, and start-ups' business plans.
In addition, the TLO tracked the sales growth and

of incorporation forward. Shane and Khurana (2000) and Shane
(2001, 2002) exploit data from the MIT TLO to explain why some
patented inventions are more likely than others to be exploited by
new firms. The analysis here begins where those studies end: at the
point of firm formation.

financing obtained by its licensees. To supplement
the TLO data, we conducted unstructured interviews with company founders and consulted online
databases including Lexis/Nexis, Diolog Business
Connection, and ABI Inform. These sources were used
to verify information and fill in gaps in the TLO
records. Finally, we obtained additional information
on the venture capital financing received by the TLO
firms from the Venture Economics and Venture One
databases. All variables were coded from these data
sources. The objective of the data collection effort was
to create detailed profiles of all firms at the time of
founding, along with a (retrospective) life history for
each firm in the data set.
Although MIT-based start ups clearly do not constitute a representative sample of all technology-based
companies, these data have two important advantages relative to other samples of new ventures. The
most important feature of these data is that the TLO
has a record of every company established to commercialize MIT's intellectual property since 1980. As
a result, the TLO data are free from survivor biasa sample selection problem that is endemic to studies of early-stage companies. Sample selection bias is
rampant in research on new ventures because archival
data sources rarely record the existence of companies that fail at a very young age. In fact, the data
we utilize evince the general difficulty of obtaining
a nonselected sample of startup companies: A number of the firms in the TLO sample fail before they
are acknowledged in any publicly available database.
Although we possess information on these organizations from the TLO archives and interviews with company principals, it would not have been possible to
learn about them from secondary sources. Moreover,
interviews with founders and TLO staff indicated that
many of these failures occurred because companies
were unable to obtain financing from external sources,
thus demonstrating the limitations of explaining how
initial endowments affect new venture performance
in samples that exclude early failures.5
5Of course, there is still a selection process that operateson these
data: The TLO, MIT inventors, and entrepreneursall influence
which MIT technologies will be licensed to start-up companies.

MANAGEMENTSCIENCE/Vol.

A second advantage of the TLO data is that there
are no left censored firm histories (i.e., all firms in
the sample are observed from the time of incorporation until a performance outcome is recorded, or until
the observation is right censored at the end of calendar 1996). Because we employ event history methods to analyze firm performance, we require a sample
without left censored observations to obtain reliable
parameter estimates.
Method
The events we model include receiving venture capital funding, IPO, and failure.6 As a general rule,
the most desirable type of liquidity event (from the
perspective of the owners of the firm) is an initial
sale of securities on the public equity markets. From
the perspective of company founders and owners,
selling equity to the public often generates muchneeded capital and the opportunity for equity holders
to exchange stock for cash. We analyze the three organizational transitions (financing, IPO, and failure) in
terms of the instantaneous transition rate, r, defined
as
<
+
>
rk(t) = lim Pr(t T < (t At), D = k I T t)
At
At40o
where k refers to one of three mutually exclusive destinations in D (the performance events). The variable
T measures the time spent at risk of making one of
these possible transitions, and the probability Pr refers
to the likelihood of experiencing one of these transitions during the small interval from t to (t +At),
conditional on a start up being at risk of making a
process that precedes the incorporationof the firm, but these data
are once again unique in allowing this issue to be examinedempirically (see Shane and Khurana2000, Shane 2001, 2002).
6
Although we possess data on angel financings,the time-to-VCfunding regressions are limited to the first occurrenceof financing from a VC firm. Becausethe sample consists entirely of earlystage technology companies,traditionalperformancemetrics such
as accounting-basedindicatorsof profitabilityare inappropriatefor
these data. For example,many of the firms in the sample are in the
biotechnology industry, and these organizationscan have highly
successful IPOs even with no revenues from the sale of internally
developed products. For this reason, we analyze performancein
terms of the rate of occurrenceof a set of importantmilestonesfor
new ventures.

transition as of time t (Tuma and Hannan 1984). The
waiting time clock in the firm event histories turns on
at the time of incorporation.
The transition to IPO and failure are treated
as "competing risks" and are modeled using the
approach discussed in Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980).
These events are terminal in the sense that the occurrence of either of them obviates the possibility that
the other transition will take place within our observation window, so an organization exits the risk
set after experiencing either event.7 The hazard of
receiving venture financing is estimated in a separate set of regressions because we model only the
first occurrence of this event. Although VC funding
could be treated as a repeatable event and included
as a competing risk in the models of the other two
performance-related transitions, our interest in how
initial conditions affect performance outcomes makes
the first round of venture financing the milestone of
greatest significance to us.8 In both the time-to-VC
funding and the IPO/ failure rate models, we create
7 Twenty-twofirms in the sample were acquired.In the hazardrate
models, we handle acquisitionby censoring the event histories of
acquiredcompanies at the time of the deal. In unreportedregressions, we have estimated the rate of acquisitionas an additional
competingrisk,but chose not to reportthe acquisitionmodels both
to conservespace and becausethe meaningof an acquisitionvaries
across events. This variance occurs because some of the firms in
the sample were acquired at relatively high valuations, whereas
others were acquiredat low valuationsor when a venture was on
the verge of liquidation.The formertype of acquisitionwas in all
likelihood construed by company principals as a successful exit,
whereasthe lattertype of acquisitionwould be viewed as a failure.
Unlike some researchers,we opted to not categorize acquisitions
as "successful"or "unsuccessful"and include the successfulacquisitions with IPOs and unsuccessfulacquisitionswith firm failures.
Thatapproachwould introducesubjectivityinto our measurement
of the dependentvariable.
8The reason for this is that venture
capitaliststypically fund their
portfolio companiesin a series of financingrounds (Lerner1994).
Thus, a new venture must receive a first round of funding to be
eligiblefor a second round,and marketconditionsand the development of the firm between roundsshould be the predominantdeterminantsof second-and later-stagefinancingrounds.This illustrates
the path dependenciesin the VC fundingprocess,but also suggests
that initial conditionsmay not play a substantialrole in later-stage
funding decisions net of their effect on the occurrenceof the first
financinground.

annual spells to update the values of the time changing covariates. Each spell ends in censoring unless an
event occurs within the focal firm-year observation.
We specify each rate as varying according to the
piecewise-exponential functional form
rk(t) = exp[yp + B'Xt],

where yp includes three duration-period effects, Xt
contains independent variables (some of which vary
over time), and B are the parameters to be estimated. We adopt the piecewise specification of duration dependence because it permits the rate to vary
flexibly with duration (in this case, firm age) without requiring strong parametric assumptions. The age
pieces we include are less than four years old, four
to seven years old, and greater than seven years old;
the baseline rate is assumed to be constant within
each period, but is unconstrained across periods. The
transition rate models were estimated using TDA
(Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995).
Covariates
Endowments-Social Capital. Our first prediction
is that company founders with pre-established ties
to angel investors or venture capitalists will be more
likely to obtain external funding for their fledgling
companies and also are more likely to achieve an IPO.
We measure the presence of a direct tie as a dummy
variable denoting that at least one member of the
founding team had a direct business or social relationship with a venture investor prior to the founding
of the firm.9 To ensure against the risk that this variable may be miscoded in the affirmative for firms that
9This variable indicates simply whether a relationshipbetween a
founder and an investor predated the founding of a company;it
does not necessarily indicate a pre-establishedtie to the specific
investor(s)who funded a focal venture (if the companydid receive
funding at some point in the future). Obviously,coding the variable as 1 if a founder had a tie with the investor that ultimately
funded the companywould be tantamountto using the dependent
variable(in the case of funding) to predict itself (i.e., the direct tie
variablewould be 1 for all companiesthat receivedfunding, and 0
for all other firms).For more directevidence of the effect of a preestablishedrelationshipbetween an entrepreneurand an investor
on the likelihood that a VC funds a new venture, see Shane and
Cable (1998)and Sorensonand Stuart(2001).

another data source confirmed that the relationship
existed prior to the time of firm founding.0l
The second contention we make is that founders
with ties to third parties who in turn have relationships with angels or venture capitalists are more
likely to obtain external funding for their companies
and also are more likely to achieve positive performance milestones." We measure indirect ties as a
dummy variable denoting whether at least one member of the founding team had a business or social tie
to a third party who had a direct tie with a venture
capitalist or angel investor prior to the founding of
the firm. As in the case of direct ties, we required documentation from at least two information sources to
code this variable in the affirmative.
Endowments-Human Capital. New ventures with
founders that have previous experience in the industry of the start-up are likely to perform well relative to companies with management teams that lack
industry familiarity. Founders with industry experience presumably have knowledge of effective strategies and customer preferences, as well as valuable
contacts with customers, suppliers, and other industry participants (Bruderl et al. 1992, Gimeno et al.
'0In the modal case, the two informationsources were interviews
with a company founder and the TLOarchives.For example, the
direct tie variablewould be coded 1 when (i) a company founder
stated that he had a pre-existingprofessionalrelationshipwith a
venture capitalist,and (ii) the TLO recordfor the founder's company contained a memo from a licensing officer indicating that
the firm would target a particularventure capitalist for funding
because one of the founders had previously conducted technical
due diligence work for that venture capitalist.
" Our
analysis excludes indirect ties to investors created by the
TLO officers.Shane and Cable (1998) report that university technology licensing officers often introduceentrepreneursto venture
investors.Althoughthis processoperatesin the settingwe examine,
we cannotexploreit with our data becausethis sourceof referralsis
likely invariantacrossthe firms in the sample.Measuringthe effect
of variation in ties between licensing officers would be problematic because MIT'slicensing officers specialize by technology and
industry.As a result, variation in social ties across licensing officers would be confounded with differencesacross industries and
technologies.

1997). We therefore create a dummy variable, industry
experience, which is coded 1 if at least one member
of the founding team had previous experience in the
new firm's industry.
Companies founded by individuals with previous start up experience also may have an advantage relative to organizations created by firsttime entrepreneurs. Start-up experience enhances
entrepreneurs' understanding of how to staff and lead
early-stage organizations, to develop new products,
and to manage relationships with investors, employees, suppliers, and customers (Bruderl et al. 1992).
We construct a dummy variable, start-up experience,
which is coded 1 if at least one member of the founding team had previously launched a new company.l2
Endowments-Technical Assets. All firms in our
sample were established to commercialize MIT inventions, but they vary in the magnitude and quality of
their technical endowments. The strength of a new
firm's intellectual property position is thought to be
an important determinant of its success, particularly
because new firms, by definition, do not have complementary assets in place (Merges and Nelson 1990,
Teece 1986). We include a number of measures of
the technological strength and quality of the firms
in the sample at the time of founding. First, we define
a variable, patent stock, to designate the number of
MIT patents that were licensed to the new venture
at founding (many of the firms in the sample license
more than one MIT-assigned patent). We also coded
a second variable, exclusive license, which indicates
whether the new venture has an exclusive right to use
MIT technology in a particular field of use.13
12In unreported models, we included continuous measures of
founders' human capital, including the total number of start ups
previously begun by all members of the founding team and the
total number of years of industry experience possessed by all
founders. In both cases, the model fit was improved when we
included the dichotomoushuman capitalproxies.
13In addition to patent stock and exclusive license, we included
in unreportedregressionsthe following proxies for the technological endowments of the firms in the sample: the total number of
internationalpatent classes in which a new venture'spatents were
listed, the total numberof claims made by all patents licensed to a
start up, the total numberof inventorsassociatedwith all licensed

We also include a variable that measures the highest rank obtained by any of the MIT inventors of
the technology licensed by the new venture. This
variable represents the prestige of the scientists on
whose knowledge the venture is based. The right
to use an invention often does not imply access
to all of the information necessary to commercialize it, nor does it convey the knowledge necessary
to develop subsequent (follow-on) technologies. In
many instances, the new ventures in our sample negotiate access to the MIT personnel who developed the
licensed technology (either on a full-time or consulting basis). We suspect that potential investors may
favor firms with access to experienced and high status investors because having well-known affiliates
is often considered a signal of new venture quality (cf. Stuart et al. 1999). As a proxy for the status and depth of knowledge of the MIT inventors
who developed a licensed technology, we measure
for each firm the highest university rank achieved
by any member of the team of inventors that created
the technology licensed by the firm. We coded this
variable as follows: student = 0, research associate =
1, assistant professor = 2, untenured associate = 3,
tenured associate = 4, full professor = 5, department
chair or research center director = 6, and institute
professor = 7.14
Endowments-Industry Attractiveness. The new
ventures in our sample are in a variety of industries,
which differ significantly in terms of the competitive environment and growth prospects they present.
We include two variables reflecting industry conditions at the time of founding (and an additional set
of time-changing covariates, which we discuss below,
that capture changes in industry circumstances). First,
patents,and a varietyof citation-basedindicatorsof the importance
and radicalnessof the patents licensed to each new venture.In the
innovationliterature,all of these variableshave been proposed as
measures of the value of patents,but none had significanteffects
in any of the models we estimated.For the sake of parsimony,we
exclude these measuresfrom the reportedregressions.

firm'shuman and social capitalendowment.Presumably,inventor
rankand technicalcompetenceare positively correlated,as is rank
and the extensivenessof an individual'scontactnetwork.

we include the size of the industry each organization
enters measured in the year that the new venture is
founded. The size measure, obtained from the Census of Manufacturers, is the total value of shipments
in the industry. Large industries may offer superior
growth chances to new ventures, because start ups in
large industries may grow without securing a large
market share.
The strength of intellectual property protection
afforded by patents varies greatly by industry. This
variance will influence new firms' abilities to protect
their technology from imitators, and thus to attract
investments and grow. To capture this heterogeneity,
we include the Levin et al. (1987) measure of patent
effectiveness, which is obtained from a survey of R&D
managers and gauges the extent to which patents are
perceived to be successful at protecting intellectual
property.
Level. TechnologyControl Variables-Industry
intensive industries are notoriously cyclic, bouncing
between "hot" and "cold" periods (Ritter 1984). The
cycles in high technology industries largely reflect
shifts in the openness and enthusiasm of the public
equity markets for new security issues in an industry, and almost surely affect the general munificence
of the resource environment faced by high technology
startups. In hot periods, investment capital is often
(relatively) plentiful; in cold periods, it may be very
scarce. We therefore include two time-changing measures of the resource richness of the industry occupied by each venture in the sample. The first variable,
the industry IPO rate, is the percentage of all VCbacked firms in an industry-year that have IPOs in the
year (i.e., the number of private, venture-backed companies that have IPOs in an industry year, divided
by the total number of VC-backed firms at risk of
an IPO in the industry year; this variable was coded
from the full Venture Economics database). In addition to the IPO rate, we also include for each start
up-year observation a simple count of the number
of venture-backed firms that had IPOs in the start
up's industry in the focal year. We chose to include
the count and the rate because, while the rate better reflects actual market conditions, the IPO count

is more readily observable and thus may be a better measure of the salience of successful outcomes for
early-stage companies in an industry.
Net of the industry attractiveness endowment variables and the time-changing measures of the industryspecific state of the equity markets, we found few
industry effects and thus report models without
industry dummies. However, we did include an indicator for the semiconductor industry in the VC funding regressions because the semiconductor firms in
the sample has a very high rate of receiving venture funding. By including this dummy variable, we
reduce the likelihood that a time-invariant industry effect is misattributed to another (correlated)
covariate.
Control Variables-Firm
Level. Although our
primary focus is on how initial conditions affect
new venture performance, we report some regressions accounting for firms' development over time.
In the models of IPO and failure, we include a number of variables that reflect the financial status of each
firm. First, we include the annually updated, cumulative amount of venture financing received, reflecting
our expectation that firms with more funding are able
to quickly progress through the development process
and are more likely to IPO. In addition to VC funding, some of the firms in our sample obtained funding
from two other sources: Small Business Investment
Research (SBIR) grants and MIT. Thus, we include for
each firm an annually updated, cumulative total of
the amount of SBIR funds received. We indicate an
investment from MIT with a dummy variable denoting the presence of equity funding from the institute. Finally, we include the cumulative sales generated by each new venture, which is again updated on
an annual basis. The sales variable is a proxy for the
extent to which a venture has progressed through the
product development cycle.

Results
Table 1 reports results from the piecewise constant
models of the hazards of IPO and failure. The first
model in the table serves as a baseline for statistical
tests and includes only the age periods for the IPO

and failure models. The pattern of duration dependence varies somewhat across the two outcomes. In
the IPO model, it is highest during the middle age
period (four to seven years); in the mortality analysis, the baseline failure rate increases in each successive period. The pattern of duration dependence in
the failure rate may be consistent with that of a liability of adolescence, in which the rate initially rises
and later declines, but this would depend on a subsequent decline in the failure rate beyond the time
period covered by these data.
Model 2 in the table adds the technology endowment variables. The number of patents licensed, the
highest rank of the MIT inventor associated with
the licensed intellectual property, and whether or not
the license was exclusive all have positive coefficients
in the IPO regressions, and both the patents stock
and inventor rank variables are statistically significant. In the failure rate model, both the patent stock
and inventor rank variables significantly reduce the
hazard of mortality. On balance, the regressions suggest that firms with large initial technology endowments are more likely to IPO and less likely to fail at
an early age.
The third model in the tables reports the effects of
the human capital endowment proxies. The signs of
these variables are consistent with expectations: Positive in the time-to-IPO model and negative in the
mortality analysis, but only the industry experience
variable in the IPO regression approaches statistical
significance.
Model 4 reports the effects of industry characteristics on the two performance measures. The Table 1
coefficients show that startups in large industries
(recall that industry size is measured in the year of
founding and is not updated over time) and those in
industries with stronger patent protection are more
likely to IPO. Although industry size does not affect
the likelihood of failure, the high technology start ups
in the sample in industries with effective patent protection are less likely to fail.
The two social capital variables are displayed in
Column 5 of Table 1. Both the measures of direct
and indirect ties to investors have statistically significant, economically meaningful, negative effects on the
probability of failure. For example, if a member of a

new venture's founding team had an existing relationship with a venture investor that predated the time
her firm was founded, she could anticipate an approximately 70% lower chance of failure. Although ties to
venture investors appear to forestall failure, neither of
the social capital variables has a significant effect on
the hazard of IPO.
The sixth model in Table 1 reports regressions
including all of the endowment effects together. The
results in the Model 6 regressions remain virtually
unchanged from earlier models. It is important that
the social capital effects persist in the failure rate models even when the measures of founders' industry and
start-up experience are included in the same model,
because founders with past industry and start-up
experience may be more likely to have relationships
with venture investors. Thus, the effects of human
and social capital may be confounded in regressions
that do not include both sets of variables.
The fully specified model including all endowment
effects and control variables is reported in Model 7
of Table 1. Among the newly added variables, the
cumulative amount of venture capital funding has by
far the greatest effect on the rate of IPO. The results
indicate that a one standard deviation increase in the
cumulative amount of VC raised multiplies the rate
of IPO by a factor of two. Unreported models show
that the VC effect is obtained simply by including a
dummy variable denoting the presence of VC funding, and these models also show this to be the single
largest determinant of IPO.15
The control variables generally have negligible
effects in the failure rate models, with two significant
exceptions. One exception is the negative coefficient
on the log of cumulative firm revenues, indicating
that firms that have developed and sold products are
less likely to fail. On the other hand, the MIT invested
dummy variable is positive and significant. One possible explanation for this is that MIT often exchanges
15When we include VC funding as a dummy variable(coded 1 in
all firm spells after an organizationfirst receives venture capital
funding) ratherthan as a cumulatingtotal of the dollar amount of
money raised,the coefficienton the dummy is 2.18 (p < 0.001).This
translatesto a rate multiplierof exp(2.18) or 8.8. In other words,

an equity position in a start-up for the up-front licensing fee it normally charges licensees. It may be that
founders who capitalize patent costs by granting an
equity stake in their companies to the Institute are
less willing or able to bear the costs associated with
developing their ventures; stated differently, the MIT
invested dummy may increase the hazard of mortality
because it is correlated with the scarcity of resources
at the new venture.
The endowment effects in the full models are fairly
consistent with the previous specifications and hold
up surprisingly well. Recall that all of the endowment
effects are measured at organizational inception and
the covariates are not updated over time. It is therefore notable that many of the endowment effects continue to have explanatory power in the full model,
despite being causal in intermediate outcomes such
as the amount of funding and revenues obtained by
the firms in the sample, which are accounted for in
the full models. The patent stock, the industry experience of the founding team, and the size of the industry at founding are the three covariates that continue
to have positive influences on the hazard of IPO. In
the failure rate models, inventor rank and the social
capital effects dominate; firms that license patents created by high status inventors and those with founders
having pre-established ties to investors fail at a lower
rate.
The Table 1 results suggest obtaining VC funding
has a very substantial influence on the likelihood of
IPO, which in turn implies that much of the variance in new venture performance is attributable to
the factors that affect the likelihood of VC funding.
The regressions of time-to-VC funding are presented
in Table 2. The baseline model in Column 1 includes
only the age pieces and a semiconductor dummy variable. As in the other regressions, we include three age
(duration) periods, but because venture funding typically occurs at a much earlier organizational age than
does failure or IPO, the age pieces in the VC funding models are defined over shorter intervals. The
coefficients on the age pieces exhibit a consistent pattern throughout the table: The baseline rate declines
sharply as organizations age. If new firms do not

attract VC funding in the initial years after founding,
they are unlikely to do so in the future.16
Column 2 includes the technology endowment variables, none of which has a significant effect on venture capital funding. As Model 3 shows, one of the
human capital variables affects the hazard of VC
funding: The rate is increased by a factor of 2.6 for
new ventures with founding teams that possess prior
experience in the industry of the start-up. Model 4
demonstrates that industry attributes factor into the
VC funding decision. New ventures launched in large
industries and those in industries that afford stronger
patent protection are more likely to receive venture
funding.
Model 5 reports the effects of the two social capital variables. Although the coefficient is just shy of
statistical significance, the presence of a direct tie to
a venture capitalist prior to firm founding has a positive influence on the rate of VC funding. The existence of an indirect tie to a venture investor prior to
firm founding very sharply increases the hazard of
receiving venture financing; the rate of VC funding
increases by a factor of 2.8 for firms with founders
that have a relationship with a third party who can
refer them to a venture investor. Moreover, the social
capital endowments result in a greater improvement
in model fit in Table 2 than does the introduction of
any of the other variables capturing differences in initial endowments.
The Column 6 regression includes all of the endowment effects together, as well as the two timechanging measures of the openness of the IPO market
16One

potentialproblemwith modeling the time-to-VCfunding is
that very high quality start-upsmay preferto delay venture funding because companies that are funded later often are in stronger
positions when negotiating with investors. To address this issue,
we ran a simple logit model of the probabilityof obtainingventure
funding without taking into accountthe timing of funding. In this
analysis,we excluded all companiesthat were founded in the last
two years of the observationperiod and thathad yet to receiveventure funding (these organizationswere excluded because there is
some chancethat they receivedfunding afterthe point of right censoring).Start-upswere coded as 1 if they receivedventurefunding
prior to failing, going public, or being acquired,and 0 otherwise.
The coefficientson the endowmentvariablesin this analysisalmost
exactly mirroredthose in Model 6 of Table2, confirmingthat similar results are obtained in analyses that ignore the timing of the
investment.

to new issues in the industry of each new venture.
Both the IPO rate and the IPO count in an industryyear increase the hazard of VC funding. At least with
regard to high technology firms striving to commercialize relatively basic technology, VCs appear to be
highly sensitive to current equity market conditions
when they decide how to allocate their capital to
projects in different industries. Although current market conditions have a large effect on the likelihood
of VC funding, the social capital variables continue
to have statistically strong effects, and in fact, the net
effects of the two variables are even greater in the
model that controls for market conditions than they
are in the paired-down specification. For the most
part, the other endowment effects remain intact, with
the measures of industry conditions at founding continuing to have a large impact on the rate of obtaining
funding.
The final model in Table 2 includes the MIT
invested dummy, the cumulative amount of SBIR
funding received, and the log of cumulative revenues.
The MIT dummy has no effect on the likelihood of
funding, but the SBIR variable has a negative and
almost significant effect. One possible justification for
this is that the negative coefficient on SBIR funding
is that it is capturing unobserved differences between
the technologies being pursued by the firms in the
sample, with SBIR grants perhaps going to more speculative technologies. Although it may seem counterintuitive, cumulative sales also has a negative effect
on the hazard of VC funding. The likely explanation
for this effect is that firms with substantial sales that
have not yet received VC funding (and thus already
exited the risk set) may not be actively looking for
funding from venture capitalists because they are able
to support their operations with internally generated
cash flows.
Putting the results from the two tables together,
the factors that increase the likelihood of an IPO also
positively impact the hazard of venture funding and
negatively influence the probability of firm failure.
This is as we would expect; since dissolutions and
IPOs are at opposite ends of the performance continuum and the aim of venture investors is to liquidate their positions in start-ups via public stock
offerings, we should observe that venture investors

are drawn to companies with high likelihoods of
achieving public offerings. The primary exception to
this pattern concerns the technology endowment variables; although these increase the propensity to IPO
and reduce hazard of failure, they have no statistical effect on obtaining venture funding. Although we
cannot definitively rule out the possibility that some
firms with significant technology endowments simply opted not to pursue venture funding, the findings
that the technology endowment has an insignificant effect on VC funding, but experienced founding teams and start-ups in more attractive industries
are more likely to receive venture backing, is consistent with the common claim in the popular press
and the entrepreneurship literature that VCs often
place the greatest weight on the management team
and the market opportunity in making investment
decisions. Because evaluations of industry conditions
and founders' experiences are relatively precise as
compared to assessments of early stage technology,
this pattern of results is perhaps unsurprising.

Discussion and Conclusion
This study has examined the influence of startups' initial resource endowments on the incidence
of critical, early-life performance milestones. Particular emphasis was placed on how founders'
social capital endowments affect the development of
entrepreneurial ventures. Analyzing the population of
new firms founded to exploit MIT-assigned inventions during the 1980-1996 period, we show that two
measures of founders' social capital-the presence of
direct and indirect ties to venture investors prior to
firm founding-sharply decrease the hazard of mortality and increase the likelihood that start-ups obtain
external funding. Moreover, comparing the effects of
many different firm and industry characteristics, we
find that the presence of venture capital funding is
the single largest contributor to the likelihood that a
start-up undergoes an IPO. We interpret these results
to mean that social capital endowments, through
their impact on the fund-raising process, have longterm, positive influences on the performance of new
ventures.
One important shortcoming of the present analysis arises from collecting retrospective data. Although
168

the TLO sample offered a unique opportunity to overcome the sample selection biases that draw into question the findings of many of the existing studies of
organizational endowments (as well as the indirect
evidence on the subject gleaned from analyses of age
dependence in organizational populations), the fact
that the measures of founders' social capital had to
be collected after the time of start-up precluded precise measurement of the construct. Because we could
not be certain that entrepreneurs would have accurate memories of the relationships they had during
the past, we were only comfortable creating dichotomous indicators of the presence of ties to venture
investors, and even then we required verification of a
relationship from a second information source. Moreover, there is always potential for recall bias in retrospective data. For example, founders who did not
receive venture funding may have been less likely
to remember their contacts to venture investors than
founders who received venture funding. This would
lead to an overestimate of the actual effects of the
social capital variables on the likelihood of receiving
venture financing.
Our inability to specify the details of entrepreneurs'
social network creates two related problems in addition to the (probably) less significant one of measurement error. First, the dichotomous tie variables
offer an indirect test of the social mechanisms that
we believe underlie them; namely, that trust emerges
from a history of past direct and indirect relationships, and thus entrepreneur-investor dyads situated
within such a network are likely to represent trusting
relationships. Because the measures of entrepreneurs'
social networks are so coarse, it was not possible for
us to be very precise about elucidating the particular
mechanisms at work. For example, do investors who
are relationally proximate to entrepreneurs perceive
company founders to be more competent? Do they
anticipate greater transactional reliability from close
contacts, and thus perceive less risk even though they
have less information than do company founders?
Or, are investors more confident because mutual third
parties confirm their opinions about an entrepreneur?
Moreover, the dichotomous tie variables obviously do
not capture any dimension of relationship strength,

either social structural (i.e., the level of embeddedness of the cited relationships) or affective (i.e., the
strength of the bonds between entrepreneurs, referrers, and investors).
A related limitation arising from the imprecision
in the measurement
of entrepreneurs'
social capital is unobserved heterogeneity. The binary measures
of direct and third-party ties to venture investors
are potentially correlated with other characteristics
of founders' backgrounds,
such as founding team
areas
of technical specialty,
size, start-up experience,
work
previous
experiences, financial status, and so
on. Although we are aware of a number of the
potential correlates of the social capital variables and
include these in the regressions, we clearly cannot
take into account all such possibilities given available information. For example, while we do measure the prior start-up and industry experience of the
founding team, we cannot measure entrepreneurial
talent. Not only would fine-grained measures of the
quality differences between founders be costly to collect, some dimensions, like the founder's charisma,
might be virtually unmeasurable.
Unfortunately, if
who

or
who are charising

matic are more likely to be in contact with venture
investors than entrepreneurs who lack these characteristics, the social capital effects may be biased
upwards because they correlate with entrepreneurial
talent. As the delineation of founders' network position becomes more exact, however, the likelihood of
correlation with unobserved factors diminishes, as
does the possibility of more precisely distinguishing
between potential mechanisms. Thus, more detailed
network measures permit more convincing empirical
demonstrations, and we therefore consider the results
of the present to be suggestive rather than conclusive.
We do, though, view the results as a step in the
direction of developing the literature on the social
context of entrepreneurial finance. While there is a
large literature in entrepreneurial finance addressing
the information and agency problems in financial contracting, explicit contracts often cannot completely
redress possible incentive problems and, moreover,
meticulous financial contracts have only been used
for the last half century and only in developed

economies. Furthermore, although elaborate contracts
are now used regularly in venture capital, they
are less frequently employed in angel finance. For
these reasons, we believe that network-based theories have much to contribute to our understanding
of entrepreneurial finance (cf. Shane and Cable 1998,
Sorenson and Stuart 2001).
