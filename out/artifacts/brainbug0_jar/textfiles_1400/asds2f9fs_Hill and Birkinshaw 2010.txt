Idea sets—the complete stock of entrepreneurial ideas an individual has accessible within his
or her memory at any given time—are proposed as a new unit of analysis through which the
antecedents, processes, and outcomes of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition may be more
fully understood. A number of dimensions are identified along which one person’s idea set may
be compared with that of another person. These comprise the novelty, volume, content, stage of
development, strategic value logic, and composite knowledge configuration of ideas within the
idea set. The idea set construct and the methods advocated for its empirical operationalization
provide a differentiated, comprehensive approach to investigating entrepreneurial
opportunities. They also help to overcome sample selection and survival biases
characterizing empirical research in this domain. A questionnaire-based idea set instrument,
designed and tested in the corporate context, demonstrates good evidence of content, convergent and divergent validities.

espite its prominence within emerging scholarship on entrepreneurship (Shane, 2000,
2003; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), research on the recognition of entrepreneurial
opportunities is still fairly embryonic (Corbett, 2007; Dimov, 2004, 2007a; Gaglio, 2004;
Ireland & Webb, 2007). One reason, we contend, for this gap in empirical research on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition is the difficulty in defining (and measuring) an appropriate unit of analysis through which to study opportunities.
A central question within entrepreneurship is ‘‘why do some people and not others discover particular entrepreneurial opportunities?’’ (Shane & Venkataram, 2000, p. 221).
Despite the considerable advances made in recent years, scholarly efforts to address this
challenging question have displayed certain tendencies, which have limited progress. One

such tendency is to focus on what we term (drawing on the language of Dimov, 2007b)
‘‘single opportunity’’ explanations, that is, efforts that focus on understanding
opportunity-person nexuses, wherein the specific opportunities at hand anchor such analysis. The dominance of studies using business foundings as historical proxies for opportunity
recognition (Dimov, 2004, 2007b) is reflective of this orientation. The alternative notion
that individuals may simultaneously recognize multiple opportunities, while seemingly not
rejected, is subject to little empirical investigation (for exceptions, refer to quasiexperimental studies by Corbett, 2007; Dimov, 2007a; Shepherd & De Tienne, 2005) or conceptual
scrutiny.
In an attempt to alleviate this bias and to shed new light on entrepreneurial opportunity
recognition, we identify and operationalize a more comprehensive idea-based unit of analysis through which opportunities may be conceptualized and studied empirically. Specifically, we propose ‘‘idea sets’’ as a new unit of analysis. Idea sets are defined as the complete
stock of entrepreneurial ideas—ranging from the ‘‘spark’’ of an idea to fully commercialized ideas—a person has accessible in memory at any given time. Consistent with a
Schumpetarian (1934, 1942) definition of entrepreneurial opportunity, such ideas are concerned with innovating along one or more dimensions of a business offering—for example,
a product/service, market, technology, production method or business model. As the primary conceptual contribution of the article, the construct of idea sets was developed
through inductive field research.
Furthermore, as a secondary conceptual contribution of the article, we identify a number
of generic dimensions that describe a person’s idea set. These were arrived at through an
iterative process of inductive field research and a survey of entrepreneurial opportunity,
innovation, and organizational creativity literatures. These comprise the novelty, volume,
content, stage of development, strategic value logic, and composite knowledge configuration of ideas within their idea set. These generic dimensions facilitate the comparison of one
person’s idea set with that of another person. With a few exceptions (c.f., Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003; Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Sarasvathy, Dew, Velamuri, & Venkataraman, 2003), entrepreneurship literature has regarded opportunities in a largely
undifferentiated manner, giving little attention to distinguishing between different features
of opportunities. By viewing idea sets along a number of dimensions and characteristics, we
contend that new insights into, and a more comprehensive understanding of, entrepreneurial
opportunity recognition is enabled.
From a methodological standpoint, we (a) identify key principles and a set of methodologies suited to operationalizing idea sets and (b) describe the development and testing of a
questionnaire-based corporate idea set instrument. The latter involved the collection of multiphase and multisource field data, comprising (a) in-depth exploratory interviews with 20
professional and managerial organizational members of a multinational fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company; (b) two rounds of pilot questionnaire development and
testing; (c) survey data from 388 professional and managerial organizational members
across three multinational companies in diverse sectors (supplemented by supervisory
data); and (d) 12-month case studies of 22 individuals from two of the companies that participated in the survey. These processes were designed to ensure adequate content and face
validity of the idea set construct, while confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and other
psychometric analyses demonstrated the convergent and divergent validities of the

instrument. It warrants mention, given the prominence of debates regarding the ontology of
entrepreneurial opportunities, that we position ourselves closer to the subjectivist than positivist end of a subjectivist-positivist continuum. Nonetheless, while the idea-based conceptualization of opportunity we use here is somewhat more akin to subjectivist notions of
opportunity creation than opportunity discovery (Gartner, Carter, & Hills, 2003), this does
not preclude its application to theorizing or (especially) empirical research of a more positivist persuasion.
This article is structured as follows. First, we propose our idea set construct as a potentially fruitful unit of analysis and discuss a range of dimensions along which entrepreneurial
ideas and idea sets can be meaningfully classified. Second, we propose a set of guiding principles and methods through which idea sets may be operationalized empirically. Third, as
an illustration of a questionnaire-based method, we describe the development and properties of an instrument to capture idea sets within large, established firms. In conclusion, we
discuss a number of theoretical and methodological implications of the idea set construct
and the questionnaire-based instrument.

Conceptualizing Entrepreneurial Ideas and Idea Sets
Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Extant Literature
Despite their centrality to entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial opportunities have been
viewed in a largely undifferentiated manner, with little attention given to characterizing
features of opportunities. Empirical methods reflect this approach: most use business
formation as a historical proxy for opportunity recognition, attempting to draw nearuniversalistic conclusions regarding opportunity recognition from populations of business
foundings. In addition to retrospective bias in founders’ accounts of business formation and
survival bias in the sampling of new businesses (Dimov, 2007a), such approaches are likely
to suffer from sample selection bias. Simply stated, how do we know that exploited business
ideas constitute a representative sample of the opportunities identified by that individual?
Emerging literature from both corporate and independent settings suggests that exploited
ideas may differ in systematic ways from those not commercialized (e.g., Czernich, 2004;
Shane, 2001). Were this discrepancy clearly accounted for by the quality (i.e., commercial
potential) of the idea, it would not present a problem. However, the emerging literature does
not suggest this to be the case. Hence, to gain a less biased understanding of processes of
opportunity recognition and pursuit, it is imperative to obtain a more comprehensive profile
of (potentially multiple) opportunities identified and considered by individuals.
Some budding shoots of enquiry in this direction are evident. In perhaps the most pertinent study to date, Gruber, MacMillan, and Thompson (2008) investigated the impact of
founding team experience on the size of the ‘‘choice set of market opportunities’’ considered prior to market entry and thereof on subsequent high-tech firm performance. In their
words (2008, p. 1662): ‘‘the notion of multiple opportunity identification prior to entry has
yet to be acknowledged in the research literature.’’ Recent quasiexperimental research on
opportunity recognition (e.g., Corbett, 2007; Dimov, 2007a; Shepherd & De Tienne,
2005) focuses on (typically multiple) opportunities identified in response to a

<-----Page 4----->88 Organizational Research Methods

quasiexperimental stimulus. In addition, the study of habitual entrepreneurs acknowledges
a multiplicity of opportunities recognized by human agents, albeit over time. Indeed,
some recent research (c.f., Baron & Ensley, 2006; Ucbasaran, Westhead, & Wright,
2009; Ucbasaran, Westhead, Wright, & Binks, 2003) in this vein specifically compares the
characteristics of opportunities identified by novice and habitual entrepreneurs.
We contend, however, that entrepreneurship literature needs to go further: to formalize a
person-centered approach to understanding actual (and potentially multiple) entrepreneurial
ideas recognized by individuals, both at any one time and over time.

Defining Entrepreneurial Ideas and Idea Sets
We propose the construct of ‘‘individual entrepreneurial idea sets’’ (or just ‘‘idea sets’’
hereafter) as a new unit of analysis for entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. We define
an idea set as
the complete stock of entrepreneurial ideas an individual has accessible within his or her memory at any given time

where an entrepreneurial idea refers to
the application of new knowledge, or applying knowledge in a novel manner, to one or more of
the dimensions of a business offering – for example, to its product/service, market, technology,
production methods or business model – such that a new or improved source of economic gain
may be realized.

The idea set construct includes ideas that are well developed as well as ideas that represent just the initial ‘‘spark’’ of possibility. The usage of the term ‘‘set’’ parallels the psychological set concept of March and Simon (1958), whereby an individual’s psychological set
refers to their memory content at a given time, whether currently evoked or unevoked by
environmental stimuli. Over time, new ideas will enter the idea set while others will be discarded (consciously rejected as infeasible and/or undesirable) or will fade from the set (as
an individual’s attention is shifted toward different stimuli). Multiple factors influence the
rate of flow of ideas within an individual’s idea set. Research in cognitive psychology
examining memory and attention suggests these to be extremely complex, including such
factors as: how deeply idea scripts were originally encoded by an individual, the context
in which they were encoded, systems of individual attention allocation across competing
stimuli, and the effectiveness of retrieval systems in accessing stored ideas (c.f., Best,
1995; Styles, 2006).
Congruent with many definitions of opportunity in the entrepreneurship literature, our
definition of entrepreneurial ideas incorporates an element of novelty. Following Schumpeter’s (1934, 1942) ‘‘new combinations’’ perspective, it suggests wider sources of opportunity than the common focus on merely new product or market elements. Epistemologically,
our conceptualization is grounded within a knowledge-based perspective on innovation
(c.f., Kazanjian, Drazin, & Glynn, 2002), whereby the elements informing entrepreneurial
ideas may be conceived as residing in diverse fields of knowledge concerning (in broad)
products, markets, technologies, production methods, and business models.

Idea Set Dimensions
We characterize idea sets along five primary dimensions. These relate to the content, volume, stage of development, strategic value logic and novelty (outcome- and process-based
novelty) of ideas within a person’s idea set. While the overall idea set construct was elaborated through inductive field research (to be described more fully later), the five dimensions
describing idea sets were provisionally identified through a review of opportunity recognition, creativity, and innovation literatures. Using these five dimensions to characterize idea
sets enables a range of important but little explored characteristics of idea generation to be
theorized and investigated empirically. By way of illustration, Figure 1 outlines a number of
possible comparisons across idea sets: categorizing these as either discernable in cross section, at any given point in time, or temporal in nature, requiring time to be discernable. In
outlining each of the five idea set dimensions below, we note some of the comparisons they
elucidate regarding peoples’ idea sets. It should be noted, however, that these dimensions
are not intended to be comprehensive; rather, they were indicated in our research (to be
described later) as being tractable to measure ex ante across a range of content areas, and
even when ideas were highly embryonic.
Content of ideas. The ‘‘content’’ of an entrepreneurial idea refers to the dimension, or
dimensions, of a business concept along which the idea introduces novelty. Thus, an idea
may be categorized as a product idea, a market idea, a technology idea, a production methods idea, a business model idea, and so on, or some combination of these. Surprisingly, the
content of ideas is seldom referred to in either extant opportunity recognition or organizational creativity literatures.
This approach elaborates Schumpeter’s (1934) ‘‘new combinations’’ perspective on
entrepreneurship, which views innovation as residing in ‘‘the new combinations of existing
stock of the factors of production.’’ Schumpeter identified factors of production as including new or changed goods, new methods of production, new markets, new sources of supply, and new organizations of production. An array of business dimensions hence exists
along which an idea can innovate—the greater the number of content dimensions along
which an idea innovates, potentially the greater the innovativeness of the associated business offering. We capture this concept by characterizing idea sets in terms of (a) the dominant content domain of ideas within the idea set and (b) whether a person’s idea set is
focused on a dominant content area (‘‘focused idea set’’) or includes ideas involving multiple content areas (‘‘diverse idea set’’; refer to Figure 1, graphic A).
Volume of ideas. Per the quest of recent quasiexperimental opportunity recognition studies to quantify the number of opportunities identified by individuals in response to a stimulus
(e.g., Corbett, 2007; Shepherd & De Tienne, 2005), idea set volume examines the quantity of
ideas within a person’s idea set. More specifically, it refers to the quantity of entrepreneurial
ideas contained within a person’s idea set in a given period of time, that is, ideas entering or
remaining in the idea set, less those leaving (refer to Figure 1, graphic B).
Stages of development of ideas. This dimension is concerned with the temporal evolution
of idea sets and characterizes them according to the various stages of development of ideas

contained therein. Ideas may be categorized along a number of stages and three possible
evolutionary pathways (viz., continued pursuit, deferment, or abandonment) suggested
by scholars of the dominant stage paradigm in innovation and entrepreneurship process literature (e.g., Bhave, 1994; Burgelman, 1983, 1991; Dimov, 2007a, 2007b). Typically, idea
progression reflects an initially individual, cognitive process that transforms into an
increasingly social, action-oriented (behavioral) process, as ‘‘potential entrepreneurs seek
to convince, engage, or organize other social actors’’ (Dimov, 2007b, p. 714).
Integrating idea volume and idea stage dimensions enables temporal characteristics
of idea sets to be compared across people, and across different contexts. For example,

<-----Page 7----->Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets

91

characteristics such as ‘‘idea set dynamism’’ and ‘‘idea set actualization’’ (refer to Figure 1,
graphics D and E) may be examined. Idea set dynamism identifies the frequency of turnover
among ideas in an individual’s idea set; idea set actualization describes the ratio of ideas
that are acted upon (i.e., that a person seeks to exploit).
Value logics of ideas. This dimension characterizes idea sets by the value logic of their
constituent entrepreneurial ideas. We draw on distinction between ‘‘value creation’’ and
‘‘value appropriation’’ of Moran and Ghoshal (1999) to differentiate between the overarching strategic logics that may inform entrepreneurial ideas. This dichotomy identifies value
creation as the formation of new sources of economic value, while value appropriation
refers to sustaining existing sources of competitive value (Moran & Ghoshal, 1999); value
creation ‘‘grows the pie’’ while value appropriation ‘‘re-slices the pie.’’ Accordingly, a person’s idea set may be concerned primarily with either creating new sources of value or with
more effectively appropriating existing sources of value. Like content—and indeed one
would expect some correspondence between an idea’s content and strategic logic—this
is an underexamined aspect of opportunities. Although some theorists would argue that
entrepreneurial opportunities are associated with value creation rather than value appropriation, we suggest that both are appropriate objects for entrepreneurial ideas (c.f., Dess,
Lumpkin, & McGee, 1999). Indeed, the Schumpeterian (1934, 1942) combinations perspective includes new process technologies or methods of production, which will frequently
embody cost reduction rationales consistent with appropriating existing sources of value.
Per the content dimension, an analysis of the strategic logics of ideas within idea sets
enables us to discriminate between (a) idea sets that differ by their dominant strategic logic
and (b) whether an idea set is focused on just one strategic logic or encompasses both logics
(refer to Figure 1, graphic A).
Novelty of ideas. Attempts to calibrate novelty occur with some frequency in creativity
literature and in broader (especially technological) innovation literature, where a radicalincremental distinction appears in many forms (c.f., Gatignon, Tushman, Smith, &
Anderson, 2002). This distinction typically relates to outcome novelty (i.e., the novelty
of an innovation output, such as of a new product). Creativity literature suggests, however,
that both processes and outcomes may differ in their degree of novelty. We hence incorporate two conceptions of novelty within idea sets: one focused on ideation process novelty
and the other on the novelty of the outcome (i.e., of the idea itself; refer to in Figure 1,
graphics A and C, respectively).
Turning to the former construct, process novelty, we sought a generic idea categorization
that embodies, as far as is possible, traces of the cognitive and knowledge processes through
which ideas were generated. The theoretical device that we introduce—knowledge configuration archetypes—decomposes ideas into their component configurations of knowledge.
Multiple literatures, including Austrian economic approaches to entrepreneurship (Kirzner,
1973, 1979; Shane, 2000), accord a critical role to an individual’s knowledge base in opportunity recognition. Empirically, recent studies have confirmed that at least some domainspecific knowledge is required to comprehend new possibilities (e.g., Corbett, 2007;
Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Shane, 2000; Shepherd & De Tienne, 2005). In fact, individual
knowledge differences as the basis for individual identification of different opportunities

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 8----->92 Organizational Research Methods

(c.f., Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) are probably one of the best supported tenets in opportunity recognition literature.
Four qualitatively different knowledge configurations are proposed to differentiate idea
generation processes. Literature on the cognitive structures constituting opportunities and
creative ideas frequently refers to two standard components, variously termed ‘‘needssolutions’’ (Goldenberg, Lehmann, & Mazursky, 2001), ‘‘functions-forms’’ (Finke, Ward, &
Smith, 1992), ‘‘demand-supply’’ (Sarasvathy et al., 2003), ‘‘value sought-value creation
capability’’ (Ardichvili et al., 2003), and so on. We draw on these constructs, using the
terms, respectively, ‘‘situation’’ and ‘‘potential action’’ here. For example, a ‘‘situation’’
may refer to an identified market need while a ‘‘potential action’’ may refer to a product
or service that is perceived as suitable to fulfill this need by an idea generator.
The four configurations are defined by the relative availability (or accessibility) of the
situation and potential action elements to an individual and, relatedly, the degree to which
he or she undertakes complex and/or creative cognitive processing to derive their
situation-potential action composite (i.e., their idea). Dimov (2007a, p. 565-566) is
instructive here:
In broadest terms, a person’s business idea constitutes a mental image of a particular group of
customers benefitting from using a particular product or service . . . . To the extent that the specific customer needs and the matching products or services are not immediately visible or
available to the particular individual, the intuiting [idea generation] process can be conceived
as ‘‘filling in’’ the gaps in the available information in order to complete the mental image.

In addition to filling in gaps, idea generation processes may involve restructuring (i.e., ‘‘a
substantive qualitative reformulation’’; Seifert, Meyer, Davidson, Patalano, & Yaniv, 1995,
p. 67) of how either the situation or the potential action (or both) are represented cognitively.1 In what we term a routine configuration, both the situation and the potential action
are readily accessed by an individual; they create an obvious fit (Demmert & Klein, 2003).
In an applicative configuration, either the situation or the potential action, but not both, are
readily accessed by an individual; the remaining piece is then filled in. In a combinative
configuration, some but not all elements of the situation and/or potential action are readily
accessed upfront; multiple remaining pieces are thereafter filled in. Finally, in a reframing
combination, neither the situation nor the potential action is accessed upfront in their ultimate form by the individual but both are significantly transformed via cognitive restructuring processes. This typology extends and reinterprets those of Sarasvathy et al. (2003) and
Ardichvili et al. (2003) from a more subjectivist perspective.
1. Routine configuration: This configuration is closest to the neoclassical problemsolving paradigm in which the situation and the potential action are both readily accessible
to an individual and are ‘‘matched’’ through the use of deductive thinking. The individual is
typically able to apply his/her local knowledge to reconcile a situation with a potential
action, without needing to engage in further search. The matching is seemingly obvious
(Demmert & Klein, 2003) to the individual concerned, and its processing is of an automatic
and highly circumscribed nature. A simple example of routinized idea generation (drawn
from our qualitative research) concerns the use of readily available automated packaging
procedures to reduce bottlenecks in a manufacturing and distribution process. To the

<-----Page 9----->Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets

93

operations manager, who saw this action as an opportunity to reduce lead-time, the usage of
automation was (to quote) ‘‘an obvious solution’’ to the packaging bottleneck.
2. Applicative configuration: In applicative idea generation, one element of the idea (i.e.,
either the situation or the action) is initially identified by an individual. Knowledge is then
applied either through search, deductive reasoning, contact with others or with another relevant environmental stimulus (Seifert et al., 1995), or through individual knowledge of
existing practices or needs (typically from more distant locations within an individual’s
domain) to complement the first identified element. The initially identified element is thus
matched with a situation or potential action following more extensive cognitive processing
than occurs within routine idea generation. Analogical transfer (Gick & Holyoak, 1980) is
likely to play a significant role in the filling in of the missing knowledge element. Applicative
generation appears most akin to Kirzner’s (1973, p. 68) description of opportunity discovery.
An example of applicative idea generation concerns a finance director who was seeking
to obtain a more strategic understanding of his company’s customer base. He recalled a presentation about a customer-oriented financial planning and reporting tool, and he used that
insight to embark on developing a similar tool.
3. Combinative configuration: This configuration presents a greater cognitive challenge,
embodying both more complex forms of knowledge matching as well as greater use of
imagination. In this form, only some but not all elements of either (or both) the situation
or the potential action is accessible upfront by an individual. She or he is thus required
to piece together disparate pieces of knowledge to perceive an opportunity, necessitating
both cognitively more complex and more divergent (Guilford, 1950, 1967) thought processes. As with applicative idea generation, the various missing pieces and their connections may be arrived at via a variety of means, including through accessing (typically
more distant domains of) memory; through search (including social sources of information); or via a chance encounter with a relevant environmental stimulus (Seifert et al.,
1995). Analogical thinking is again likely to play a significant role in the filling in of missing gaps in the knowledge elements.
Combinative idea generation overlaps both creative and discovery modes of cognition
(Buchanan & Vanberg, 1991), being akin to what some creativity theorists have deemed
more minor or constrained forms of creativity, involving the ‘‘extension of existing structures to significant but more limited problems’’ (Mumford & Gustafson, 1988, p. 31). An
example of combinative idea generation was described by a marketing manager when envisaging a stylish dispensing system for home use in washing and bathing. She described
combining the following observations made over approximately a 12-month period:
(a) consumer needs for reduced clutter in their bathrooms and (b) for increased convenience
in purchasing washing and bathing products (both identified through market research) with
(c) a company-identified trend toward more aesthetic decoration by homeowners, and
(d) seeing an unusual product packaging system being introduced by another product
category within her company.
4. Reframing configuration: This form of idea generation involves the most creative cognitive processes of the four archetypes. It entails an individual progressing from a state in
which he or she knows neither the ultimate form of the situation nor of the potential action
initially but rather ‘‘invents’’ these such that their original cognitive representations of the
relevant domains are substantially restructured. Analogical thinking—most likely entailing

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 10----->94 Organizational Research Methods

an unusual commonality from a distant domain—is especially likely to characterize such
cognitive restructuring. A paradigmatic shift representative of ‘‘breakthrough’’ or ‘‘radical’’
innovations (c.f., Gatignon et al., 2002) may accompany ideation of this type.
An example concerns a technology manager who was approached by an inventor who
had developed a revolutionary cheap, disposable pump technology to dispense epidural
analgesics to mothers during childbirth. The manager came up with the idea of substantially
adapting the technology to administer standard doses of an over-the-counter medication to
children in a nonspill fashion (a highly novel product benefit). This application was very
distant from the domain in which the inventor had envisaged its use and it also involved
a substantial transformation to its technology. The technology manager described coming
up with the significantly transformed ‘‘situation-potential action’’ combination - for a product category in which he had worked many years previously—in the following manner:
Then twenty years later, you see this [the auto-dosing technology for epidural analgesics], and I
think, ‘This can pump gels’. If I make this press in and twist until it clicks, and I know that 5
grams has been dispensed and that it will be dispensed every time, I could even dispense it [the
children’s medication] into a little cup . . . and the child can slop the liquid around and it still
won’t come over the side [as occurs with medicine spoons currently].

Measuring Idea Sets
Measuring idea sets involves a reorientation of existing methods for researching opportunity recognition. Key guiding principles and a set of recommended data collection techniques are outlined below. Thereafter, in the next section, the development, testing, and
properties of a questionnaire-based idea set instrument are described to illustrate one possible data collection method for idea sets.

Guiding Principles for Measuring Idea Sets
Five key and interrelated principles guide the measurement of idea sets. These are outlined, along with their rationales, and a set of recommended data collection techniques, in
Table 1.
First, measuring idea sets necessitates a person-centered approach. As an essentially
intrapersonal, cognitive phenomenon, idea sets indicate an individual level of analysis.
As we argued earlier, an individual level of analysis complements the more dominant
single-opportunity orientation (Dimov, 2007b; Gruber et al., 2008) in the literature.
Together, they offer a more comprehensive understanding of the antecedents of opportunity
recognition and exploitation.
Second, measurement efforts should aim to generate as comprehensive a coverage of a
person’s ideas at any one time as possible. Greater comprehensiveness enables more valid
interpretation of idea set dynamics and hence of individual-level opportunity recognition
and exploitation. This includes fuller sampling across temporal dimensions and multiple
content domains than has been standard to date. Rather than focusing on patented innovations or founded businesses (Dimov, 2004, 2007a), efforts should be made to capture ideas

at all stages of development—including very early stage ideas, as well as those that are ultimately discarded or put ‘‘on hold’’—as well as ideas across a range of content domains.
Third, measurement should attempt to assess multiple dimensions of ideas within idea
sets. Characterization of idea sets along multiple dimensions is necessary to recognize the
bountiful diversity between people in their idea generation profiles, some illustrations of
which have been portrayed in Figure 1. An enhanced ability to differentiate between different persons’ idea sets, in turn, will facilitate more nuanced investigations into what is
known to be a complex array of factors influencing opportunity recognition and pursuit
(Davidsson & Honig, 2003; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006).
Fourth, as close as possible to real-time measurement of idea sets should occur. Although
this principle applies to much behavioral research, it is particularly critical here given that
the cognitive processes involved (especially during initial phases of idea generation) frequently occur below the level of awareness (Gaglio, 2004) and are thus little suited to retrospective introspection. Only through real-time measurement can important components of

<-----Page 12----->96 Organizational Research Methods

idea sets, such as ideas considered on a fleeting basis and how attention is distributed across
an idea set, have much hope of being captured empirically.
Finally, the measurement of idea sets should ideally be longitudinal in nature. Although,
once again, this principle applies to much behavioral research, it is particularly valuable
when researching idea sets. One rationale behind longitudinal data collection is to more
fully understand the processes involved in recognizing and pursuing (or otherwise) individual opportunities (Dimov, 2007a, 2007b). Another, more novel, reason for conducting longitudinal measurement on idea sets is to understand their inner temporal dynamics: how
processes of variation, selection and retention occur within idea sets, and the impact of this
hitherto underresearched set of variables on idea generation and pursuit.

Data Collection Techniques for Idea Sets
These five principles circumscribe the set of techniques appropriate for collecting data
on idea sets. Without wishing to preclude alternatives that may also prove suitable, those
techniques that appear to us to warrant greatest consideration are self-report questionnaires;
semistructured interviews (possibly including verbal protocol analyses); and the keeping of
diaries by participants (refer to Table 1). All are compatible with an individual level of analysis; with the collection of (near) real-time, field data on a range of idea characteristics; and
are amenable to longitudinal research designs.
Self-report questionnaires asking aggregate questions regarding idea set characteristics
offer potential for large sample research on idea sets. By way of illustration, the section that
follows describes in depth our development and testing of such an instrument in the corporate entrepreneurship context. For richer probing of the specific ideas constituting idea sets,
more intensive methods such as semistructured interviews with entrepreneurs (either corporate or independent) or the keeping of diaries by participants may prove valuable. Both are
especially well-suited to longitudinal designs too. Indeed, a component of the research on
which this article is based (and from which the bulk of the earlier idea generation examples
were drawn) was longitudinal case studies with 22 individuals in two large multinational
companies over a 12-month period. These involved initial face-to-face interviews (approximately one-and-a-half hours each), which were followed by three telephonic interviews
(lasting approximately 45 minutes on average), one every 3 months. In each interview, a
semistructured format was followed that addressed the status of ideas (if any) mentioned
previously by the individual as well as any new ideas generated by the individual over the
preceding period.
An interview format may also lend itself to techniques such as verbal protocol analysis
(Ericsson & Simon, 1993) or similar, whereby participants could be asked to ‘‘think aloud’’
about ideas they are considering. Such techniques appear particularly well suited to examining the cognitive processes underlying idea generation, through their avoidance of overt
reflection on the processes involved (for a recent example, albeit using scenarios, see Gregoire, Barr, & Shepherd, 2006). In addition, participant diary techniques, especially where
diaries are updated on a frequent basis (c.f., Amabile, Barsade, Mueller, & Staw, 2005),
appear to hold particular promise for capturing fleeting ideas.
For all these techniques, we recommend triangulation of more readily observable individual data, where feasible. For example, in testing the questionnaire-based instrument

<-----Page 13----->Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets

97

described next, we obtained supervisory assessments to corroborate participants’ more
readily observable idea generation characteristics. In addition, performance data could be
collected on commercialized ideas. Finally, in terms of organizational-level techniques suited to the corporate context, methods such as the analysis of idea competitions or company
suggestion schemes may provide a fuller picture of ideas generated within corporations.
Although far from representing a ‘‘corporate idea set’’ and still being prone to a degree
of left-censoring on temporal idea dimensions, such techniques represent promising complements to the more dominant examination of patents or product introductions in this
domain.

An Empirical Illustration: Development and Testing of an Idea Set
Instrument in the Corporate Context
Development of Idea Set Instrument
We engaged in a three-phase development and testing process to create a questionnairebased instrument to measure idea sets in the corporate context, a neglected domain for
entrepreneurial opportunity research. First, we undertook exploratory, interview-based
research into entrepreneurial idea generation in large, established firms. We developed and
dimensionalized the idea set construct during this phase, seeking to maximize its content
validity through rigorous grounding via our interviews in the field. We then piloted two versions of the questionnaire, focusing on ensuring construct validity and ease of response
across a variety of roles and corporate settings. Finally, we collected self-report survey data
from 388 professional and managerial organizational members of three large, multinational
companies; supplemented by supervisory assessments in one of the companies. Together,
these data were used to establish adequate levels of content, convergent and discriminant
validity for the idea set instrument.
Phase I: Exploratory research study. Our initial period of exploratory research formed an
essential component of the research study given the underexplored nature of our phenomenon of interest, especially to large, established firms. We first conducted semistructured
interviews with 20 professional and managerial organizational members, who had attended
a business school executive short course. All were from a large, multinational FMCG company and represented a number of different functional areas, and operating companies from
nine countries. They also varied considerably along dimensions such as tenure, seniority,
and personal experience. The interviews (all tape-recorded and transcribed) averaged 40–50
minutes; 8 were held face-to-face, and 12 telephonically. They followed a semistructured format, examining: participants’ academic and work backgrounds; the roles and activities of their
current job; ideas they had considered over recent months; and their pursuit of these ideas.
A further component of this exploratory phase involved interviewees completing a first
version of the questionnaire. Twelve participants (i.e., 60%) did so. This version was structured around respondents answering questions on one (or more) entrepreneurial idea they
were considering at the time. It provided numerous spaces for comments, feedback to the

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 14----->98 Organizational Research Methods

researchers, and elaboration of ‘‘other’’ responses. Five respondents also provided verbal
feedback on the process of completing the questionnaire.
As this phase progressed, we came increasingly to question the feasibility (and value) of
focusing on ‘‘the opportunity’’ or ‘‘the idea’’ as the unit of analysis. A critical difficulty in
the first version of the questionnaire was our inability to assess the representivity of the
ideas mentioned by individuals among those they were considering. Conversely, we
increasingly came to see our early formulations of an idea set construct as a more viable
and interesting unit of analysis. Using cross-case tabulations (Miles & Huberman, 1994)
to analyze the data, it was apparent that idea sets could readily be differentiated along
dimensions such as the volume, content, strategic logic, and novelty of ideas as well as the
extent to which ideas were acted on. These analyses also suggested patterns of association
between factors such individual knowledge profiles, exposure to contextual stimuli, and
idea set characteristics, providing early evidence of the nomological validity of idea sets.
We hence decided to reformulate the questionnaire not around participants identifying specific ideas but rather to examine their idea sets as our primary unit of analysis.
Phase II: Development of measures and pilot testing. We then piloted the revised questionnaire with a convenience sample of 30 professional and managerial organizational
members. Participants were from multiple countries and companies, and again reflected
wide variation along functional area, tenure, disciplinary background, seniority, and personal experience. We used this pilot phase to test whether the new measures were understood, readily answerable, and sufficiently comprehensive. We also conducted initial
tests of the psychometric properties of these new measures. Specifically, we conducted tests
for reliability (examining interitem correlations) and dimensionality (using principal components analysis [PCA]) for our reflective measure, confirming its unidimensionality.
Using this combined output to identify the items with lowest factor loadings and interitem
correlations (following standard guidelines; Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma, 2003), we
trimmed the items from eight to four. For the formative measures, we were concerned to
capture the entire scope of the relevant constructs, given that formative items comprise a
census rather than a representative sample of the construct (Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer,
2001; MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Jarvis, 2005). Thus, we paid careful attention to instances
in which nonstandard responses (or written feedback) were provided, incorporating additional or omitting items where so indicated. For all measures, we were concerned with evidence regarding their parsimony and ease of use. For the minority of questions for which
ambiguous responses, a low response rate, or a number of comments were received, we
alternatively reworded or omitted the question concerned.
It warrants brief mention here, too, that we chose to structure the questionnaire around
the ideas generated by individuals over a 6-month period. We could find little guidance
in either cognitive psychology or organization theory literature on the temporal duration
of ideas. Indeed, a contentious debate in memory literature centers on whether stored
knowledge is ever ‘‘lost’’ or, rather, remains accessible given appropriate retrieval conditions (c.f., Best, 1995). Furthermore, memory and attention research is typically concerned
with cognitive processes that span a number of seconds or minutes. Hence, we used the typical length over which participants in the exploratory research reported considering their
ideas as the basis for the chosen 6-month period.

Phase III: Empirical testing of instrument. The principal data collection comprised a survey of 388 professional and managerial organizational members. This was supplemented by
supervisory ratings from one of the companies that participated in the survey.
a. Self-report data collection: Self-reported idea set data was deemed essential given the
primarily cognitive and intrapersonal nature (Baron & Ensley, 2006; Corbett, 2007; Shane,
2003) of opportunity recognition. Full sampling of managerial and professional employees
across different levels, functions and countries of participating divisions within three companies occurred. The companies are large publicly held multinationals from different sectors: one a major milk company; another, a major household products FMCG company; and
the third, a major pharmaceutical company. The multiphase contact process closely followed that advocated by Dillman (2000), with three paper communications per participant
following an advance company endorsement e-mail from a senior manager within each
company. Self-addressed, prepaid envelopes were provided for the confidential return of
completed questionnaires directly to the researchers. An overall response rate of 55% was
obtained.
Respondents had been working, on average, for close of 16 years, of which about 10
years had been spent in the participating company, and 4 years in their current job. Males
made up 65% of the sample, and 6% and 10% reported having started their own business or
started a new corporate venture, respectively. The range of vocations represented included
marketers, salespersons, operations and logistics experts, R&D scientists, chemists, production and chemical engineers, and general managers. Chi-squared and protected t tests found
some significant differences for the geographic locations and functional areas of respondents and non-respondents. Specifically, the proportion of European respondents was somewhat higher than that of other countries (i.e., the United States, Australia, South Africa, and a
number of countries in South America, the Middle East, and Asia; w2, df(5) ¼ 52.96, p ¼
.000). Regarding functional area, the proportionately higher-responding groups were in operations as opposed to logistical or technical functions (w2, df(1) ¼ 19.04, p ¼ .000), and in new
business development or R&D groups, as opposed to marketing functions (w2, df(5) ¼ 3.04,
p ¼ .04).
b. Supervisory data collection: Although some aspects of idea sets are clearly of an
exclusively intrapersonal nature and would not be observable by others, we collected supervisory assessments on responding employees from one of the participating companies in an
attempt to establish the convergent validity of the idea set measures. Overall, these ratings
show a fair degree of correspondence with those of the responding participants, lending support for their validity. The supervisory questionnaire attained an excellent response: 89%
(34) of supervisors responded, covering 88% (75) of individual respondents from the company to the principal questionnaire.

Properties of Idea Set Instrument
The idea set measures of the principal survey are provided in the Appendix. We report
first the properties of the single-item measures, namely, idea set content and idea set knowledge configurations. Thereafter, we report on the multi-item measures, namely, idea set volume and idea set value logic (both formative measures), and idea set novelty (a reflective

<-----Page 16----->100 Organizational Research Methods

measure). In all, the measures show good evidence of convergent and discriminant validity
as well as high reliability (where appropriate).
Idea set content. Schumpeter’s (1934) list of new or changed goods, new methods of production, new markets, new sources of supply, and new organization of production served as
the foundation for the idea set content measure. We amended ‘‘new or changed goods’’ to
include services and ‘‘new organization of production’’ was amended to ‘‘new or changed
internal processes’’ based on the pilot feedback. We also turned to contemporary literature
on business models (e.g., Kim & Mauborgne, 2004; Markides, 2000) to identify additional
elements constituting ‘‘new combinations,’’ adding items regarding new or changed distribution channels, marketing or sales approaches, technologies underlying a product or service, and business models. In the final measure, we asked respondents whether their ideas
over the previous 6 months had entailed either new or changed aspects along each content
domain. Each of the final nine items constitutes a single content domain. Hence, while it is
inappropriate to examine reliability or dimensionality, low Pearson coefficients (most under
.10) between the items and those of the other idea set measures indicate that capture distinctive component of the idea set construct.
Idea set knowledge configurations. A single-item measure with multiple response categories assessed the knowledge processes through which individuals had generated ideas
over the previous 6-month period. Consistent with our proposition of four nonoverlapping
knowledge configurations underlying idea generation, the response categories were constructed to capture the percentages of ideas within an individual’s idea set reflecting each
of these mutually exclusive configurations.
Supervisory ratings indicated that respondents and their supervisors agreed more on the
extent to which routine ideas were generated (Pearson’s r ¼ .25, p ¼ .02) than on more
novel forms of ideation.2 This moderate level of convergence was consistent with our
expectations; we did not expect very strong convergence on this idea set dimension given
the intra-personal nature of the processes concerned. Per the content measure, it is inappropriate to examine reliability or dimensionality for this measure given its single-item
nature; fairly low Pearson coefficients (most under .15) between its items and the other idea
set measures indicate, however, that it captures a distinctive component of the idea set
construct.
Idea set volume. To assess idea set volume, we sought a comprehensive (but not overwhelming) inventory of developmental stages through which ideas may progress. For each
stage, respondents were asked to estimate the number of ideas they had considered or
worked on over the previous 6-month period. We derived the inventory of stages both from
our review of the literature as well as descriptions of idea status that emerged from the
exploratory interviews. Two adjustments from these interviews were (a) to include an
‘‘on hold’’ category (i.e., ideas temporarily deferred for future attention, viz., a category
we did not find in the literature) and (b) to differentiate between early stage ideas being
explored alone or as part of a team. A frequency analysis of the pilot data suggested the
response options.

<-----Page 17----->Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets

101

The measure for idea volume is clearly a formative one; overall volume is derived from
the totality of ideas reported across all developmental stages. Furthermore, we would not
expect a high correspondence between, for example, the volume of individual versus team
ideas or the volume of ideas individuals generate and the ratio of those accepted by firms.
Surprisingly, however, we found via exploratory factor analysis (EFA) that a single component accounted for a great deal of variance across the individual items. Specifically, PCA
indicated a single factor (with an eigenvalue of 3.48) to account for 50% of the variance,
with item loadings ranging from .59 to .81. CFA also indicated that all items loaded significantly on a single factor (p < .001). As a single-factor scale too, it showed good levels of
reliability (Cronbach’s a ¼ .83).
Additionally (as demonstrated in Table 2), the idea set volume measure shows good evidence of discriminant validity—via the pattern of lower loadings of idea set volume items
on the other multi-item measures than on itself. This is an important finding as, while procedures and standards for establishing the validity of formative measures are still under
development (c.f., Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer, 2001; MacKenzie et al., 2005), examining formative measures in a nomological network is widely regarded as a critical component of such an endeavor. Given that, by definition, one does not necessarily expect high
correlations between all items comprising formative measures, too much emphasis should
not be placed on the individual item correlations but rather on the overall pattern of
loadings.
Not unexpectedly, individual and supervisory perceptions of idea set volume only
correlated significantly for those ideas currently being launched or implemented (Pearson’s
r ¼ .21, p ¼ .04) and for the broader set of ideas that had attained company support
(Pearson’s r ¼ .20, p ¼ .04; in one-tailed tests).
Idea set value logic. We looked to classic strategic management literature (e.g., Ansoff,
1957; Lieberman & Montgomery, 1988; Porter, 1980, 1985) to develop items capturing the
strategic logic of ideas. This suggested multiple strategies for attaining competitive advantage, including differentiation, cost leadership, early mover advantage, use of superior
existing assets (a Ricardian rent concept), and market expansion strategies. We also
observed the strategic rationales provided by our pilot interviewees for their ideas. We then
classified the rationales derived from these sources as either predominantly value-creating
or value-appropriating. A six-item measure resulted with three formative indicators for
value creation and three formative indicators for value appropriation. The correlations in
Table 2 provide evidence for the discriminant validity of the two value logic measures.
Idea set novelty. Our outcome-based novelty measure consisted of four reflective items
examining the extent to which respondents viewed their ideas as novel, indicated by terms
such as ‘‘frame-breaking,’’ ‘‘unconventional,’’ and ‘‘visionary.’’ PCA indicated all four
items to load on a single component with an eigenvalue of 2.76 explaining 69% of the variance. Item loadings ranged from .81 to .87. CFA also indicated an excellent fit of the data
to a single-factor model (Tucker-Lewis Index [TLI] ¼ .999, comparative fit index [CFI] ¼
1.00, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] ¼ .015). All items loaded significantly (at p < .001) on the single factor. Per the process novelty measure, supervisory
assessments indicated that respondents and their supervisors agreed more on the extent

to which routine ideas were generated (Pearson’s r ¼ .25, p ¼ .02; one-tailed test) than on
more novel forms of ideation. In all, this measure demonstrates strong levels of convergent
and discriminant validity as well as possessing very high levels of reliability (Cronbach’s

Discussion
Our intention in this article was to advance a new unit of analysis for entrepreneurial
opportunities—the idea set—and to describe our efforts to measure this conceptualization
empirically in the corporate context. Critically, a new unit of analysis appears necessary to
advance theoretical thinking on entrepreneurial opportunities as well as to make researching
these more empirically tractable. The idea set construct and proposed methods embody two
major points of departure from extant approaches.

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 19----->Hill, Birkinshaw / Idea Sets

103

First, the idea set captures a more comprehensive set of cognitive artefacts concerned
with ‘‘possible conjecture[s] that a set of resources is not put to its ‘best use’’’ (Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000, p. 220). The bulk of opportunity recognition literature is derived from
studies that use business founding as a proxy for opportunity recognition (Dimov, 2007b;
Gaglio, 2004). This has privileged the investigation of opportunities with a specific set
of characteristics. Critically, it has biased the analysis of opportunity recognition to those
ideas which a person decides to exploit and (in most research designs) which survive for
a significant period (Dimov, 2007a).
This bias would not be problematic if two conditions are held. The first condition
would be that no false negatives or false positives occur in entrepreneurs’ decision making, that is, that all entrepreneurial ideas generated but not pursued by an individual were
not in fact lucrative and viable opportunities (and vice versa). The bounded rationality
(March & Simon, 1958) of human cognition and circumstances of Knightian risk
(Knight, 1964) seriously mitigate against this holding true. The second condition would
be that the factors and processes determining venture survival were identical to those of
opportunity recognition. To the contrary, an emerging body of work suggests the antecedents of opportunity recognition and opportunity exploitation differ significantly
(Corbett, 2007; Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Dimov & Shepherd, 2005; McMullen &
Shepherd, 2006).
Hence, in the absence of robust methods of forecasting the value of opportunities ex ante
and finding unsatisfactory the positivist approach that holds implemented ideas that prove
successful ex post as constituting ‘‘opportunities’’ (c.f., Dimov, 2007b), we assert that
examining the full range of entrepreneurial ideas under consideration (and tracking their
evolution) presents a considerably less biased representation of entrepreneurial cognitions
for that agent. In this respect, the idea set construct regards entrepreneurial ideas at any
stage of development (c.f., Dimov, 2007a, 2007b) and relating to any aspect of a business
offering as valid subject matter, plus it takes an active interest in those ideas which are forgotten, rejected or ‘‘put on hold’’ over time. It hence penetrates beyond the traditional
product-market focus of business founding studies as well as the circumscribed set of ideas
tapped through quasiexperimental studies.
The second point of departure of the idea set construct and measures is its greater dimensionality. Ideas have been differentiated along the following characteristics in this paper:
volume, content, stage of development, value basis, outcome novelty, and composite
knowledge configurations. These dimensions allow for the systematic comparison of one
person’s idea set with that of another person. Although it is not uncommon to characterize
product and technological innovations along multiple dimensions (such as a radicalincremental distinction), doing so is rare in opportunity recognition literature. Furthermore,
via the knowledge configuration typology, we introduce a knowledge-based categorization
of process novelty into the entrepreneurial opportunity literature. In so doing, we extend and
reinterpret from a more subjectivist perspective, the categorization of markets of Sarasvathy
et al. (2003) and Ardichvili et al. (2003), facilitating insights into the (multiple) knowledgebased cognitive processes of idea generation.
It should be noted that the dimensions we have identified and measured here are not
intended to be comprehensive and that further work may wish to examine additional idea
set characteristics. Rather, our research indicated these to be tractable to assess and

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 20----->104 Organizational Research Methods

measure ex ante across a range of content areas—even where ideas are highly embryonic.
A dimension quantifying the economic size of an idea (hence, the value of an individual’s
idea set at any given time) is an obvious exclusion (Åstebro & Gerchak, 2001). This we
contend, based both on our field work and in taking ex ante uncertainty (Knight, 1964)
seriously, is an important dimension but one better assessed for those ideas actually
commercialized.

Implications for Theory
The idea set unit of analysis provides a critical ‘‘bridge’’ (or missing link) between
contextual and individual antecedents, and entrepreneurial behavior, holding the potential
to shed light on what is currently largely a ‘‘black box’’ in entrepreneurship literature. In
other words, a person’s idea set mediates between their context and their actions to pursue
(or otherwise) new ventures. Viewing opportunity from an agent-centric, idea-based
perspective, the idea set construct aids theory development on two important topics. Given
the centrality of these topics to scholars across both the subjectivist-positivist spectrum and
independent and corporate entrepreneurship settings, we contend that idea sets may provide
a valuable device for theory building on entrepreneurial opportunities. These topics are
(a) identifying who generates entrepreneurial ideas with which characteristics (viz., the
antecedents of entrepreneurial ideas) and (b) which factors affect the fate of entrepreneurial
ideas (viz., the consequences or outcomes of entrepreneurial ideas). Moreover, idea sets
provide the linkage from the one to the other—that is from idea antecedents to opportunity
pursuit (or otherwise).
To both these topics, and their intersection, an idea set unit of analysis indicates new variables requiring consideration. Put simply, the profile and dynamics of an individual’s
aggregation of ideas merit consideration. These previously neglected variables hold promise for capturing unobserved heterogeneity in explaining the antecedents and outcomes of
opportunity recognition. For example, the volume of ideas a person is considering as well
their content may influence the degree to which they notice specific stimuli that may act as
idea triggers. Both cognitive capacity constraints and processes of selective attention (Fiske
& Taylor, 1991; March & Simon, 1958) are likely conditioned by a person’s idea set characteristics at a given point in time, in turn influencing their volume and character of new
ideas generated. Thus, the idea set unit of analysis suggests alternative explanations as to
‘‘why do some people and not others discover particular entrepreneurial opportunities?’’
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000, p. 221). In addition, it adds precision to characterizing the
opportunities in question.
Regarding the consequences of opportunity recognition, using an idea set unit of analysis
again suggests an additional set of explanatory factors to the question: ‘‘why, when, and
how do some people and not others exploit the opportunities that they discover?’’ (Shane
& Venkataraman, 2000, p. 222). Understanding the aggregation of ideas being considered
by a person at any given time casts new light on this question, suggesting that the profile and
volume of their existing ideas may affect (relative assessments of) the attractiveness and
feasibility of acting on any one such idea. Enhanced explanatory power is hence a potential
benefit of the idea set construct for theory building on opportunity pursuit.

Implications for Research Methods
Empirical methods to measure entrepreneurial opportunities are still in their infancy,
accompanying the recent surge of interest in this topic. These methods have a very tricky
phenomenon to try to capture—cognitive phenomena are notoriously difficult to measure.
Hence, any method is likely to be controversial and to provide only partial clues to the
underlying nature of its subject.
Future work may suggest refinements to the idea set dimensions and to the empirical
methods we have advocated (including, in particular, the questionnaire-based instrument
outlined in some depth here), but we hope that these represent a useful advancement in
operationalizing empirically this challenging phenomenon. The idea set measures indeed
showed fair evidence of both divergent and convergent validity, and our field work suggests
they get much closer to the nature of corporate entrepreneurial ideas than does received
work. Furthermore, nomological validity was demonstrated through complex patterns of
individual and organizational antecedents accounting for the idea set dimensions.3
Finally, although we believe that capturing idea sets will, in the main, elucidate more
comprehensive and nuanced data regarding individual level opportunity recognition variables and processes, it is worth pointing out that we foresee a continued role for studies
focusing on single ideas (or a small set of ideas). Indeed, extant research methods may at
times prove the only feasible methods, especially where sample determination problems are
high and extensive data access is prohibitive. In addition, they may continue to prove useful
for investigating factors and processes at higher levels of aggregation, such as industrylevel opportunity recognition. Quasiexperimental techniques, in addition, may more readily
isolate facets of opportunity recognition of theoretical interest but which are difficult to
control in field studies. These techniques, furthermore, are not subject to the same survival
biases as business founding studies and can hence validly be used to draw conclusions
regarding young and fleeting ideas, albeit with constraints on their generalizability to nonlaboratory settings.

Major Limitations
Although we attempted to overcome multiple methodological hurdles in designing our
empirical study illustrating idea sets, a number of limitations clearly remain. We focus
on three limitations that we consider most serious, discussing their immediate implications
for future research. The first limitation relates to the primarily self-reported nature of our
data. Given the principally intrapersonal, cognitive nature of the phenomenon, a selfreport methodology was largely unavoidable. Self-reports pose problems though, including
those related to common method variance, consistency motifs, and social desirability influences (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986). In addition, we were not able to entirely overcome (especially for the knowledge configuration measures) retrospective accounts. We hence sought
to validate idea set variables against supervisory assessments, recognizing that one would
not expect absolute correspondence between the views of respondents and others. We suggest future studies try to incorporate further multisource assessments (for example, from
peers and reportees). Additionally, multimethod approaches to investigating idea sets may
prove helpful to further construct refinement.

The second limitation relates to the cross-sectional nature of the survey data. This is problematic for inferring causality and for understanding temporal characteristics of idea generation. Accordingly, we encourage more longitudinal studies into idea generation as
temporal variables are currently underexplored. A very real problem persists in even longitudinal studies though: attempting to record ideas only fleetingly considered. We believe
our methodology has helped reduce the left-censoring associated with studying either business foundings or patented inventions, but we cannot claim comprehensiveness in this
respect. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the 6-month period used in the questionnaire,
while based on temporal data provided by the pilot research, needs further testing.
A third limitation is the grounding of the construct and instrument within the corporate
context. Consequently, we encourage the validation of the dimensions and measures within
the independent venturing context. In particular, the idea content and value logic measures—and the choice of reference point—may require refinement. Although the reference
point in the extant measures is that of the parent company, multiple referents could apply to
independent entrepreneurs, influencing responses obtained. By way of illustration, most (if
not all) new business ideas would be value creation opportunities for the individual entrepreneur, while (from an industry standpoint) the majority would be regarded as appropriating existing sources of value. These and other issues may require further refinement.

Avenues for Future Research
In Table 3, we outline a number of broader avenues to advance entrepreneurship research
via the application of idea sets. We see promising opportunities to advance knowledge in
three principal directions: ‘‘typing’’ opportunity recognition, better understanding the antecedents of opportunity recognition, and better understanding the exploitation of opportunities recognized by an individual. Most of these research avenues apply across both
corporate and independent entrepreneurship settings.
Given that efforts to dimensionalize opportunity have been limited in entrepreneurship
research to date, little is known about whether distinctive ‘clusters’ (or types) of ‘‘opportunity recognizers’’ occur. Through factor analyses or clustering algorithms, the existence of
consistent patterns of association across idea set characteristics may be explored. Configurational analysis techniques (c.f., Fiss, 2007), could then, should such ‘‘types’’ be discovered, explore the origins of these in various contextual and individual factors. Theory
development could then proceed with greater precision, relating to different patterns of
opportunity recognition.
Earlier, we touched on implications for entrepreneurship theory of introducing idea sets
as a ‘‘bridge’’ between opportunity recognition antecedents and entrepreneurial action.
Accordingly, we propose two major research directions via which idea sets may contribute
to advancing knowledge on the antecedents and behavioral outcomes of opportunity recognition. First, taking an idea set unit of analysis is likely to illuminate with far greater nuance
how various individual, social network, and organizational factors influence opportunity
recognition—including identifying potential commonalities and differences in the impact
of such variables on the different idea set characteristics. Similarly, for understanding the
determinants of opportunity pursuit, the influence of multiple factors on what proportion
and which ideas are acted upon, are rejected, and are put ‘‘on hold,’’ appears potentially

unit, and then organization levels—could add additional insight into opportunity pursuit the
corporate context. Second, we encourage research that directly examines (for the first time,
as far as we are aware) the role of an individual’s existing ideas on both opportunity recognition and actions to exploit recognized opportunities. This is, to the best of our knowledge,
an omitted variable in opportunity research to date that may provide fertile ground for generating new insights into the dynamics of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and
pursuit.

Conclusion
To conclude, it is evident that the academic community still has a considerable way to go
in understanding entrepreneurial opportunity recognition. The time may, however, be ripe
for furthering knowledge in this domain given the burgeoning interest in entrepreneurship
within both start-ups and established firms. In this article, we have described our efforts to
develop a new unit of analysis for entrepreneurial ideas—idea sets—and to subject this to
empirical measurement. We hope that others will find our efforts valuable in taking up the
challenge of advancing knowledge of this important and intriguing domain.

Notes
1. We are grateful to the anonymous reviewer whose very helpful insights significantly refined our conceptualization of the role of existing knowledge structures in each of the knowledge configurations.
2. The significant correlation was between self-reported percentages of ideas fitting the routine idea generation configuration and managerial ratings along the item ‘‘He/she tends to come up with ideas that are highly
routine e.g. where a problem has a pretty clear solution.’’ A one-tailed test was used.
3. Discriminant and regression analyses found differences between the various idea set dimensions (as
dependent variables), multiple measures examining an individual’s work experience, and their exposure to specialist and generalist stimuli (as independent variables). For example, for idea set volume and novelty (as two
characteristics most frequently investigated in creativity research, albeit seldom jointly), knowledge breadth
was consistently associated with volume, while exposure to broad and deep stimuli were more strongly related
to novelty.

Respondents were asked to examine the content of the business ideas they had thought about or
worked on over the previous 6 months and to indicate the extent to which their ideas had been about
the specified nine business domains. Response options were, from left to right: ‘‘none of my ideas’’;
‘‘some of my ideas’’; ‘‘most of my ideas’’; and ‘‘all of my ideas.’’

Respondents were asked to estimate the number of business ideas they had thought about or
worked on over the previous 6 months. The following additional instruction was included: ‘‘Please
read all the category descriptions before marking the number of ideas that fit into each. If an idea has
passed through a number of stages, count it only for the category that describes it at its most developed. It is acceptable to check ‘zero’ for any (or all) categories if you have not been thinking about
new ideas over the past six months.’’ Response options were, from left to right: ‘‘0’’; ‘‘1–2’’; ‘‘3–4’’;
