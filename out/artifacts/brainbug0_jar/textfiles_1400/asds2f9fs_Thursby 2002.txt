istorically, commercial use of university research has been viewed in terms of spillovers.
Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in technology transfer through licensing
as universities attempt to appropriate the returns from faculty research. This change has
prompted concerns regarding the source of this growth—speciﬁcally, whether it suggests
a change in the nature of university research. We develop an intermediate input model to
examine the extent to which the growth in licensing is due to the productivity of observable
inputs or driven by a change in the propensity of faculty and administrators to engage
in commercializing university research. We model licensing as a three-stage process, each
involving multiple inputs. Nonparametric programming techniques are applied to survey
data from 64 universities to calculate total factor productivity (TFP) growth in each stage.
To examine the sources of TFP growth, the productivity analysis is augmented by survey
evidence from businesses who license-in university inventions. Results suggest that increased
licensing is due primarily to an increased willingness of faculty and administrators to license
and increased business reliance on external R&D rather than a shift in faculty research.

Introduction

According to the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) surveys, licensing activity in
U.S. research universities has increased dramatically
in the 1990s. For the 64 universities responding to
the survey in each of the years 1994–1998, yearly
invention disclosures increased 7.1% per year. Over
the same period, new patent applications and licenses
and options executed annually grew by 17.1% and
8.4%, respectively. In 1998 alone the 132 universities
responding to the survey reported a total of 9,555
disclosures, 4,140 new patent applications, and 3,078
licenses and options executed.
This growth in the so-called “commercial outputs”
of academic research has received considerable attention both from technology managers and university
administrators who cite it as evidence of the increasing contribution of universities to the economy (e.g.,
Management Science © 2002 INFORMS
Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002 pp. 90–104

AUTM press release, 1998) and policy makers who,
in contrast, question the impact of commercial activity on the conduct and industrial impact of faculty
research (Congressional Record 1999). Unfortunately,
there is little evidence to evaluate the arguments since
these growth rates alone tell nothing about the productivity of university resources devoted to technology transfer, nor do they provide evidence on the
sources of increased licensing.
In this article, we explore the source(s) of this
growth in university licensing. We focus on the role of
inputs, including intermediate inputs, in the process,
and we examine the extent to which the explosion
in licensing is being driven by faculty and university administrators becoming more entrepreneurial. In
particular, is the primary source of growth simply an
increased propensity for university administrators to
patent and attempt to license faculty inventions? To

what extent is growth due to an increased propensity
of businesses to license university inventions? Has the
propensity of faculty to disclose inventions increased
either because they are more willing to license as well
as publish their research or because their research has
shifted toward topics of more interest to industry? It is
the latter element of faculty propensity that has been
the focus of policy discussions.
We model technology transfer as a three-stage production process involving multiple inputs in each
stage. The three stages follow the sequence of steps
typically involved in licensing university inventions.
First-stage outputs are invention disclosures, which
are ﬁled by faculty when they believe their research
results have commercial potential. In addition to faculty, ﬁrst-stage inputs include federal and industry
research support as well as TTO (technology transfer
ofﬁce) personnel.1 Disclosures are intermediate inputs
to a second stage in which the TTO applies for patents
on those disclosures they believe can be patented and
licensed. Inputs for this stage also include a measure
of faculty quality to capture patent potential. In turn,
patent applications and disclosures are used along
with other licensing inputs in a third stage to produce
license and option agreements.
We provide two types of evidence on the sources
of growth. The ﬁrst is a productivity analysis using
AUTM survey data for 64 U.S. universities for 1994–
1998 that provide evidence on the extent to which
growth in each stage is a direct result of increases in
inputs devoted to technology transfer. The second is
based on a survey of businesses that licensed university inventions over the period 1993–1997. These survey data, in conjunction with our productivity results,
allow us to consider the extent to which licensing has
grown because of changes in the propensity of faculty
and administrators to engage in commercial activity
and/or changes in business behavior toward universities.
In the productivity analysis, we use nonparametric programming techniques developed by Fare et al.
(1994) to examine productivity growth. For each of
1
TTO (technology transfer ofﬁce) personnel are university employees responsible for encouraging and aiding faculty in disclosing
and for executing licenses agreements with industry.

the three stages, we construct a best practice frontier that represents the maximum feasible stage output given available inputs and existing attitudes or
knowledge. This approach allows us to identify both
frontier performance and operation within the frontier. Thus, total factor productivity (TFP) growth can
be decomposed into two components: one reﬂecting a
frontier shift and another showing movement toward
(catching up) or away from the frontier. Given the
dramatic growth of licensing activity and reorganization of a number of TTOs during the early 1990s, both
components of growth are likely to be important.2
For the 64 universities in our sample, we ﬁnd TFP
growth rates for disclosures and patent applications
that are roughly 5% lower than the nominal growth
rates noted above, and, for licenses executed, TFP
growth is negative. While this implies that much of
the growth in university commercial activity stems
from input growth, it also suggests that changed
propensities are an important element of growth. Of
particular note is the negative TFP growth in licenses
that, coupled with increased disclosures and patent
applications, can be interpreted as evidence of universities delving more “deeply” into the available pool of
commercializable inventions. To the extent that universities are trying to increase the number of inventions licensed without a concurrent shift in the underlying distribution of inventions, we would expect a
decline in the commercial appeal of inventions at the
margin. Thus, we would expect inventions, on average, to have less commercial potential, even though
the total value of inventions licensed would increase.
This result is particularly interesting in light of Henderson et al.’s (1998) evidence from an earlier period
(1965–1988) that as university patenting increased, the
importance (as measured by citations) of university
patents declined.
To examine why propensities to engage in university/ﬁrm licensing have changed—that is, to examine the possible sources of TFP growth—we draw
on the results of our business survey as well as the
productivity analysis. For the ﬁrst stage, our interest is in whether the growth in disclosures (net of
2

inputs) is due to a reorientation of faculty research
toward the needs of industry and away from basic
research, or whether the growth is due to a greater
willingness on the part of faculty to disclose as well
as publish the results of their research. For the second stage, we focus on whether productivity growth
stems from a greater receptivity of university administrations to industry contracts. In the ﬁnal stage, our
major interest is the extent to which growth stems
from changes in industry R&D3 or from factors leading to the growth in disclosures and patent applications.
The survey supports the view that industry reliance
on university inventions increased during this period,
and, in indicating the reasons, respondents weighted
changes in their own R&D more heavily than a
change in faculty research toward topics of greater
interest to industry. Together with the productivity
results, this suggests that the primary reason for
increased invention disclosures may indeed be an
increased propensity for faculty to disclose rather
than a change in research focus. The industry survey
also supports an increased receptivity of universities
to industry contracts. This result, together with the
fact that these businesses increased their contractual
agreements with universities, reinforces our interpretation of our stage three productivity results that negative TFP growth most likely reﬂects university efforts
to patent and license inventions with marginal commercial potential.
Finally, we ﬁnd that much of the growth in TFP for
the disclosure and patent stages comes from catching up by universities that were operating within
the frontier. Only for the patent stage do we ﬁnd
both a shift in best practice and catching up. Further, we ﬁnd that growth patterns differ according to
public/private status and whether a university has a
medical school.
These results contribute to the growing literature
on the industrial impact of academic research. The
bulk of this literature has focused either on the role of
patents and publications in the transfer process (see
Adams 1990, Henderson et al. 1998, and Jaffe et al.
3

This explanation follows from discussions with industry licensing

1993) or on consulting, sponsored research or institutional ties (see Cohen et al. 1998; Mansﬁeld 1995;
Zucker et al. 1994, 1998). While several recent papers
provide evidence on the nature of university licensing (e.g., Jensen and Thursby 2001, Mowery et al.
2001a,b, Mowery et al. 2001, Siegel et al. 1999,
Thursby et al. 2001, Thursby and Kemp 2001), none
of them provides a structure that allows analysis of
the sources of growth.
One beneﬁt from our structure is that we can comment on the growing policy debates on the BayhDole Act of 1980, which gave universities the right
to license inventions from federally funded research.
Much of the concern of those who question the act’s
impact comes from fears that ﬁnancial returns to
licensing would divert faculty from basic to applied
research. In their study of licensing activities at
Columbia, Stanford, and the University of California
system, Mowery et al. (2001a,b) point out that faculty at these universities had a long history of applied
research well before the Bayh-Dole Act. Since neither their work nor ours examines the pattern of faculty research, we cannot reject the notion that faculty
research has shifted. However, the intermediate input
structure of our productivity analysis, combined with
our industry survey, allows us to show that changes
in the direction of faculty research appear relatively
less important than other factors, such as the dramatic
increase in the propensity of administrators to patent
and license faculty inventions. This was, in fact, an
intended effect of the Bayh-Dole Act.

University Technology Transfer:
A Multistage Process

In this section, we provide background information
on the licensing process and present our multistage
model. The programming approach we adopt for
the productivity analysis is described in §3, and the
results are given in §4. The business survey is discussed in §5; §6 concludes.
2.1. Disclosures
The licensing process begins with a faculty member
reporting a discovery that he or she believes has commercial potential. This report, or disclosure, involves
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 3----->THURSBY AND THURSBY
Sources of Growth in University Licensing

faculty providing the TTO with information on the
invention and inventors, funding sources, potential
licensees, as well as barriers to patent potential (such
as prior publication).
It is important to realize that invention disclosures
represent a subset of university research with commercial potential. The TTO personnel we interviewed
in an earlier study of university licensing in U.S. universities indicated that they believe less than half of
the faculty inventions with commercial potential are
disclosed to their ofﬁce (Thursby et al. 2001). In some
cases faculty may not realize the commercial potential
of their ideas, but often they do not disclose inventions because they are unwilling to risk delaying publication in the patent and license process. Half of the
ﬁrms in our industry survey noted that they include
delay of publication clauses in at least 90% of their
university contracts (Thursby and Thursby 1999). The
average delay is nearly four months, and some ﬁrms
require as much as a year’s delay.
Faculty who specialize in basic research may not
disclose because they are unwilling to spend time on
the applied research and development that is often
needed for businesses to be interested in licensing
university inventions.4 Respondents to our TTO and
industry surveys noted that 88% and 84%, respectively, of licensed university inventions require further development, and that 45% and 44%, respectively, of licensed inventions are no more than a
“proof of concept” at the time of license. The ﬁrms
noted that for such inventions, faculty cooperate in
further development more than 40% of the time.
Finally, some faculty may refuse to disclose for “philosophical” reasons related to their notions of the
proper role of academic scientists and engineers.
Thus, for a variety of reasons, the TTO personnel we
interviewed indicated that one of their major challenges is obtaining faculty disclosures.
We model invention disclosures for university u
(DISCu ) as a function of observable and unobservable
inputs. Observable inputs are faculty size, research
funds, and the number of full-time equivalent
personnel in the TTO (TTOFTEu ). Since disclosures
4

See Mansﬁeld (1995) and Zucker et al. (1994) regarding faculty
who are successful in both applied and basic research.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

are generally based on research that has been ongoing for some time, we use the average over the preceding three years of the amounts of federal research
support (LAGFEDu ) and industry-sponsored research
(LAGINDu ). For faculty size, we use the number
of faculty in each of the major program areas—
biological sciences, engineering, and physical sciences
(TOTFACui=1 2 3 ). By not aggregating faculty across
ﬁelds, we attempt to capture the fact that research
methods and market interest in inventions can differ
markedly across the sciences and engineering.5
The unobservable inputs are the faculty’s propensity
to disclose (PROPu1 ) and the probability of invention
discovery (1 ). Thus,
DISCu = f1 TTOFTEu  LAGFEDu  LAGINDu 
TOTFACui=1 2 3  PROPu1  1 

(2.1)

The propensity to disclose reﬂects both the direction
of faculty research and faculty willingness to disclose,
and it can be inﬂuenced by the policies and practices of university central administrations as well as
the perceived potential for monetary gain. 1 represents the probability of discovery, conditional on
the level of research effort (e.g., research support
and faculty size) and split of effort between basic or
applied research. In terms of an individual invention, 1 represents the “black box” probability that
a given amount of research effort will result in an
invention, which we assume is independent of the
university. Given the short time frame of our analysis
(ﬁve years), it is unlikely that 1 has changed significantly, if at all.
2.2. Patents
Once an invention is disclosed, the TTO evaluates patent and commercial potential. From our earlier survey, it is clear that many TTOs apply for
patents only when they expect to ﬁnd licensees easily.
Mowery et al. (2001b) note that six years after disclosure slightly more than 20% of disclosures at Stanford
and the University of California system have patents.
5
As discussed in Thursby and Kemp (2001) engineering is more
applied than the other ﬁelds, and it is also said that biological sciences have more of a seller’s market than the other two.

<-----Page 4----->THURSBY AND THURSBY
Sources of Growth in University Licensing

Of course, many inventions, such as copyrightable
software and reagent materials, are not eligible for
patent protection.
We consider new patent applications (PATENTSu )
by university u, rather than patents awarded, as our
measure of second stage output, in part because of
substantial lags between application and issue, but
also because patent applications are a better measure
of a university’s interest in commercialization than
are patents awarded. Observable inputs to the patent
stage are the number of disclosures, number of personnel in the TTO, and a measure of faculty quality.
The latter is included to adjust for possible differences in commercial quality and novelty of disclosures across universities. Like our measure of faculty
size, the quality measure is by major program ﬁeld
(QUALui=1 2 3 ). Patent applications are also a function
of an unobservable propensity to patent (PROPu2 ). Since
the decision to apply for a patent (which is ultimately
owned by the university) is largely made by TTO
personnel, the propensity to patent is indicative of
the commercial aggressiveness of the university central administration.6 Thus, university u’s second-stage
production is modeled as
PATENTSu = f2 DISCu  TTOFTEu 
QUALui=1 2 3  PROPu2 

(2.2)

Note that faculty interests in commercialization enter
through the observable DISCu .
2.3. License Agreements
License and option agreements executed by university
u (LCEXECu ) are modeled as a function of the numbers of disclosures and patent applications as well as
the size of the TTO ofﬁce. We include both disclosures and patent applications because some licenses
are executed without patent protection and the fact
that a patent application is made may well provide
information about the perceived quality of patentable
disclosures. As was the case with patent applications,
6
It is often the decision of the TTO as to whether a patent is applied
for. In our survey of TTOs we found that the TTO believes it closely
reﬂects the interests of their central administration (see the analysis
in Jensen and Thursby 2001).

94

we include faculty quality in an attempt to adjust for
possible differences in commercial quality and novelty of disclosures and patent applications across universities, and hence likelihood of ﬁnding a licensee.
Unobservable inputs are the university’s propensity to
license inventions (PROPu3 ) as well as the distribution
of industry interest in university inventions, 3 . Our
model of licenses and options executed is
LCEXECu = f3 DISCu  PATENTSu  TTOFTEu 
QUALui=1 2 3  PROPu3  3 

(2.3)

PROPu3 reﬂects the TTO’s ability and knowledge
as well as their aggressiveness in ﬁnding potential
licensees. 3 represents market conditions that are
independent of the other inputs. In terms of a single invention, it is the probability of ﬁnding a match
in the market conditional on invention characteristics.
Since both PROPu3 and 3 could have changed during our sample period (and our business survey indicates a change in 3 ), we are not able to identify their
separate effects. Note that faculty and administration
propensities enter through DISCu and PATENTSu .
An alternative approach to modeling the last stage
would be to include license revenue and/or sponsored research associated with licenses as outputs.
This would allow us to analyze TFP in terms of the
returns to licensing, and the programming techniques
we employ are well suited for examining multiple
outputs. There are, however, several problems with
taking this approach. While AUTM collects information on royalty income and sponsored research associated with licenses, royalty income in any given year
comes not only from current licenses but also from
licenses executed in previous years. In many cases,
the licenses executed may have been 10 or more years
prior. It is also not clear how systematic the relation between royalty income and license inputs is
since the distribution of royalty revenue is highly
skewed. In our earlier survey, we found that on average 76% of the license revenue reported by universities is attributable to their top ﬁve inventions. Sponsored research associated with licenses is clearly a
function of licenses and inputs within the same year.
The problem with using this as a measure of output
is that we know TTO personnel often trade off royalties and sponsored research in their negotiations.
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 5----->THURSBY AND THURSBY
Sources of Growth in University Licensing

As discussed in §4.1, we calculate TFP for sponsored
research, but we believe licenses executed is a more
reliable measure of output.

3.

A Frontier Analysis of Total
Factor Productivity

We examine productivity in each of the three stages
using an approach developed by Fare et al. (1994).
The approach is based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is a nonparametric linear programming approach to comparing inputs and outputs. For
each of the three stages and for each of the universities, DEA produces a yearly efﬁciency rating or
score by ﬁrst determining the set of universities that
exhibit “best practice” for the stage under consideration. These universities are said to form the production frontier that relates inputs and outputs. All other
universities are then compared to the subset of best
practice universities that they most resemble in terms
of inputs and outputs. Thus, for each stage and for
each university and year, DEA determines whether
the university lies on the frontier (exhibits best practice) or, if not, how “far” from the frontier it lies.
Yearly changes in the frontier and performance relative to it allow us to examine growth in each stage.
It is important to note that the programming
approach is not statistically based and therefore does
not allow for statistical tests of hypotheses.7 Its advantage is that it imposes very little structure on the
problem. DEA was developed to examine technical
efﬁciency of not-for-proﬁt institutions that provide
(possibly) multiple outputs (or services) using multiple inputs where price data are either unavailable
or distorted. The only data required are input and
output quantities, and no assumptions are made on
functional form. No restrictions are placed on institutional objectives. This is particularly important for
our case since universities have multiple objectives in
their technology transfer. In our earlier university survey, we found that many TTOs view themselves as
7

There has been some recent work on distribution theory with
regards to DEA output, but that work is nascent (see the discussion
in Grosskopf 1996). A problem we face here is that the efﬁciency
scores (and, hence, TFP growth rates) are not independent so that
standard statistical tests are inappropriate.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

balancing a variety of objectives ranging from attracting industry-sponsored research for faculty to maximizing license income for their central administration.
Others, particularly public university TTOs, view the
public use of university technology within their state
as one of their objectives.
The idea behind the best practice frontier is most
easily seen in the case of a single input and single output. Suppose university u produces output y u from
input xu , then any other university j with input xj =
xu should be able to produce at least y u ; otherwise, it
is inefﬁcient. If j produces more than y u when using
the same input level as u, then university u is inefﬁcient. Similarly, if university j produces y j = y u , then
it should use no more than xu or it is inefﬁcient. If
j uses less than xu , then u is inefﬁcient. Best practice
performance for a university in any stage and year
simply means that no other university is doing better
in that stage and year given their inputs and outputs.
In our case, each stage has a single output but multiple inputs so that DEA involves the maximization
of the ratio of a single output to a linear combination
of inputs. Essentially, in DEA each university in each
stage is compared to all other universities in the same
stage to determine if some combination of other universities has a larger ratio of output to a linear combination of inputs. If no combination of universities
has a larger ratio, then the university under examination is said to be efﬁcient and it lies on the best
practice frontier. Otherwise, the university is said to
be inefﬁcient. An efﬁciency score for a university is
the fraction of potential output produced by the university; for example, a score of 0.6 implies that, based
on the performance of comparable universities on the
frontier, the university is producing 60% of what it
could be producing. A precise statement of the linear
programming problem is found in Appendix A.
Once we have established the best practice frontier
for each year for some stage and the position of each
university vis-à-vis that frontier, we can then measure
TFP changes from year to year for each university.
The measure of TFP growth is the geometric mean of
two Malmquist indexes, one of which is based on the
best practice frontier in period t and the other based
on the frontier in t + 1.8
8

See Caves et al. (1982) for the properties of the Malmquist index.

95

<-----Page 6----->THURSBY AND THURSBY
Sources of Growth in University Licensing

TFP growth can be decomposed into two components. One is the component of productivity change
that stems from movement toward or away from frontiers in successive years; it is growth due to either
catching up or lagging of universities not on the frontier in at least one period. The other is the component
of productivity change that is due to frontier shifts
between successive years. This effect is said to represent technical change. This notion of technical change
is quite general and simply represents changes in output that cannot be attributed to a change in input
usage or to a change in relative efﬁciency. Readers
interested in a more precise statement of this measure
of TFP growth and its decomposition are directed to
Appendix A.
Since the DEA analysis controls for observable
inputs, both technical change and changes in efﬁciency reﬂect changes in the unobservable inputs,
hence they are useful in examining the sources
of growth. That is, the unobservable component
(PROPu1 ) of DISCu reﬂects both changes in faculty
research and propensity to disclose; both of which can
be inﬂuenced by university policy. In the PATENTSu
stage, faculty attitudes are captured by the observable DISCu , and the unobservable input (PROPu2 )
reﬂects TTO (central administration) attitudes. In the
LCEXECu stage, unobservable inputs reﬂect TTO and
market characteristics (PROPu3 and 3 ). Thus, changes
in TFP in Stage 1 reﬂect changes in PROPu1 , while for
Stage 2 TFP changes reﬂect changes in PROPu2 , and
for Stage 3 TFP changes reﬂect changes in PROPu3
and/or 3 .

Productivity Analysis

In this section, we present both efﬁciency and TFP
growth rates for each of the stages deﬁned in §2 for
a sample of 64 universities. The TFP growth rates are
based on a constant returns to scale production frontier. Information on data is in Appendix B.
Before turning to results, we note that our sample of 64 universities represents a substantial fraction
of all research conducted by and commercial activity
of U.S. universities. In 1998, our sample accounts for
almost 54% of federal research support and 57% of
industry support to all U.S. universities. The sample

accounts for 61% of licenses executed, 59% of disclosures, and 62% of new patent applications by the 132
respondents to the 1998 AUTM survey. We are conﬁdent that our sample represents more than half of
the population of research and licensing conducted
at U.S. universities during the period of our observations (1994–1998).
4.1. Total Factor Productivity Growth
Table 1 gives the geometric means of our computed
indexes of TFP growth, as well as the output (nominal) growth in each stage. Our measures of productivity growth give a more tempered view of growth
in commercial activity than do output indexes (which
are typically reported). For example, the growth rates
in disclosures and patent applications are 4.4% and
5% higher, respectively, than the TFP growth rates.
For licenses the difference is dramatic, with licenses
executed growing at 8.4% per year and TFP falling
1.7% per year.
What immediately stands out is the large annual
TFP growth rate (12.1%) in the patent stage as compared to either disclosures (2.7%) or licenses executed
(−17%).9 These growth rates account for growth in
observed inputs, so that TFP growth can be interpreted as reﬂecting changes in the unobservable
9
Beginning in June 1995, provisional patent applications were permitted. Some have argued that this has increased patent activity in universities since it allows faculty to more quickly publish
results without compromising U.S. patent rights, although provisional patents can endanger foreign patent rights. Unfortunately,
the AUTM survey counts a provisional patent application as a new
patent application (although a provisional that is converted to a
regular application is only counted once), thus some of the patent
growth could be a result of the introduction of provisional applications. However, the TFP growth rate between 1993 and 1994 is 1.078
so that TFP growth in new patent applications was still substantial
without provisional patenting.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 7----->THURSBY AND THURSBY
Sources of Growth in University Licensing

inputs. In particular, they suggest a modest increase
in the propensity of faculty to disclose (PROPu1 ) and
a substantial increase in the propensity for university
administrators to patent (PROPu2 ). While we cannot
separate PROPu1 into effects from research focus or
output, as opposed to the willingness to disclose, the
industry survey results reported in §5 suggest that
research focus is, at least from industry’s perspective,
not a major reason for growth in licensing. Further,
the stark difference in TFP in the ﬁrst two stages is
consistent with industry responses that universities
are more “receptive” to licensing.
What might account for the negative TFP growth in
licenses? One possibility is a bias resulting from the
fact that our growth rates do not fully account for lags
between disclosure and patent application and the
signing of license agreements. It is unlikely, however,
that this effect is systematic. Licenses executed today
may have come from disclosures and patent applications ﬁled several years earlier, so that the measured productivity of disclosures and patent applications today may be higher than actual productivity.
On the other hand, the fact that today’s disclosures
and patent applications may lead to licenses in later
years implies that measured productivity today may
be lower than the actual. Since the growth rates we
report are geometric means over a four-year period,
these effects may wash out.
A second explanation is that TTOs have become
more demanding in their contract negotiations (i.e.,
conditional on commercial “quality” of a technology,
asking price has increased). Several industry licensing
executives with whom we spoke claimed that universities were “asking for too much.” We tend to discount this explanation for several reasons. Responses
to our industry survey suggest that business executives believe universities are more receptive to contracts. While this does not negate higher asking prices,
it casts some doubt. We also calculated TFP growth
using sponsored research as a measure of the return
or valuation of licenses executed. As we noted in §2.1,
sponsored research tied to licenses is ﬂawed as a measure of current valuation since there is a trade-off
between royalties and sponsored research funds. If we
are willing to assume that our time frame (ﬁve years)
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

is sufﬁciently short that there have been not substantial shifts in preferences for one source of income over
the other, then we can examine research funds tied to
licenses as a measure of the valuation of licenses. The
TFP growth in such funds is −107%. Valuation, therefore, is falling at a more rapid rate than are licenses
executed. This leads us to our next explanation.
A third, and we believe a more plausible, explanation is that the observed growth in disclosures
and patent applications reﬂects universities delving
more “deeply” into the available pool of commercializable inventions. Increasing contracts and falling TFP
together suggest declining commercial appeal for the
marginal disclosures and patent applications. That is,
since TFP growth is net of disclosures and new patent
applications (which themselves have been growing),
the implication is that, while many more technologies
are being offered and licensed to industry, the proportion of licenses executed to those offered is falling.
This productivity result reinforces Henderson et al.’s
(1998) evidence of a decline in the importance of university patents (as measured by citations) from an earlier period (1965–1988).
To look further at the relation between TFP growth
in licensing and growth in disclosures and patent
applications, we regressed the log of the annual
licensing TFP index on the logs of the growth rates
in disclosures and patent applications.10 TTO staff
is the only other measured input for licenses that
changes in our data, so we included the log of its
growth rate. The R2 is 0.13 and both patent applications and TTO staff are negatively related to licensing TFP and are signiﬁcant (t ratios are smaller than
−43). The disclosure TFP growth index is not signiﬁcantly related to licensing TFP growth (t ratio =
028). The patent and TTO elasticities are −0303 and
−0529, respectively. The negative patent elasticity is
consistent with our interpretation of declining productivity of the marginal invention. While the negative TTO elasticity may seem to be an anomaly, it
actually provides an additional explanation for falling
10

The regression variances are not strictly correct as they do not
account for the nonindependence of the TFP observations, which
follows from DEA calculations that are based on the comparisons
of a university’s outcomes with that of other universities.

TFP in Stage 3. Rapidly expanding TTOs may exhibit
lower TFP because there is a steep learning curve for
new hires (they may be unfamiliar with faculty and
industrial networks important for ﬁnding licensees,
etc.) so that new staff are, on average, less productive,
which implies negative effects on TFP.
4.2. Efﬁciency Growth and Technical Change
To what extent can we say that best practice has
changed over this period, and to what extent has TFP
growth reﬂected inefﬁcient universities catching up
to the frontier? Returning to Table 1, we again ﬁnd
our results differ markedly across stages. Only for the
patent stage do we ﬁnd both a shift in the best practice frontier and a movement, on average, of universities closer to the frontier. The latter result implies universities are becoming more similar in their patenting
propensity. This increasing efﬁciency is modest over
the four years as average efﬁciency rises from 0.597
in 1994 to 0.628 in 1998.
The 2.7% growth in TFP for disclosures appears
to come primarily from universities moving closer to
the frontier, with a slight inward shift of the frontier.
As with patents, we interpret the efﬁciency growth
as indicating universities are becoming more similar in their disclosure behavior. Average efﬁciency
rises from 0.556 in 1994 to 0.661 in 1998. In contrast,
the decomposition of licensing TFP into efﬁciency
and technical change suggests that there is increasing
diversity in the success rate of universities in turning patents and disclosures into licenses. On average,
there is growth in the frontier, but there is increasing inefﬁciency among universities with average efﬁciency falling from 0.697 in 1994 to 0.517 in 1998.
4.3. Feedback Effects
In modeling the stages involved in licensing we have
allowed early stage outputs to affect productivity in
later stages, but we have not allowed for success in
later stages to affect early-stage activity. It is natural, however, to expect faculty to disclose inventions
only if they believe their TTO can successfully license
them. We also know from our earlier university survey that TTOs tend to apply for patents only when
the likelihood of ﬁnding a licensee is high. Thus, past
success in licensing may well affect the propensity
98

of faculty to disclose and the propensity of the TTO
to patent. In this section, we consider such feedback
effects.
One way to incorporate feedback effects would be
to include ﬁnancial rewards from licenses executed
as inputs in the ﬁrst two stages. The problem with
this is the same problem (discussed above) with using
ﬁnancial returns to licenses in measuring TFP in the
third stage. That is, ﬁnancial returns to licenses executed can appear either as royalty income or as sponsored research money directed to the inventor’s lab.
In our interviews with TTO professionals we were
told that some universities actively seek sponsored
research at the expense of royalty income, so that
information on royalty income, for many universities,
is an incomplete measure of ﬁnancial rewards.11 In
addition, royalty income in any given year can be
attached to licenses executed in the distant past and
current licenses might not result in income for a number of years.
As alternatives, we consider both the number of
licenses and the ratio of licenses to disclosures in the
recent past as inputs to the disclosure decision. One
can think of licenses executed as a “demonstration”
that the disclosure process has value, either because of
potential royalty revenue and/or sponsored research
or simply as an indication that companies value their
work. In our earlier survey, several TTO personnel
claimed that some faculty treat the very fact that a
license is signed as a nonpecuniary gain, attaching
value to the fact that their discoveries have commercial appeal. The ratio of licenses to disclosures is a
measure of the success rate of the TTO and should
also serve to encourage faculty to disclose. The measures we use are (i) the average number of licenses
executed over the preceding three years and (ii) the
ratio of the three-year average of licenses to the threeyear average of disclosures.
Including both measures of this demonstration
effect produces a marked change in the ﬁrst-stage
11

For more on this issue, see Thursby and Kemp (2001). It should
also be noted that the tax treatments of a ﬁrm’s royalty expenses
and a ﬁrm’s sponsored research expenses are different; the former
is a deduction, while the latter can be a credit. Thus, ﬁrms are not
indifferent across the two methods of payment for a license.

results. Rather than TFP growth of 2.7%, the growth
rate falls to 1.5%. In decomposing this growth into
technical change and efﬁciency change we ﬁnd that
there has been negative growth in technical change
(−48% per year) and positive growth in efﬁciency
(6.6% per year). If we drop the ratio of licenses to
disclosures, the results remain virtually identical. If,
however, we drop the average number of licenses and
retain the ratio, the results are very similar to our
results without feedback effects. The implication of
this is that the growth in faculty propensity to disclose
is clearly linked to licensing success as measured by
the number of licenses executed in the recent past.
Finally, including these two measures of past licensing success as feedback effects in the patent stage
has a smaller relative effect on the propensity of university central administrations to patent. TFP growth
falls from 12.1% to 10.5%, and we continue to ﬁnd
TFP growth in both efﬁciency and technical change.

Industry Survey

The picture that emerges from our analysis of the
AUTM data is that, while the so-called commercial
outputs from university research have grown substantially, this growth reﬂects increased TFP only in the
ﬁrst two stages. We ﬁnd negative TFP growth in Stage
3, which we believe is indicative of the declining commercial appeal of license disclosures and patent applications at the margin. While this highlights the role
of university inputs in increased commercial activity,
the productivity analysis provides limited information about the sources of TFP growth, and it does not
provide any evidence on the role of business behavior in the process. That is, we cannot tell the extent to
which growth in university licensing activity was due
to a shift in faculty research toward topics with more
commercial appeal, an increase in university attempts
to market inventions, or to an increase in demand for
university contracts because of changes in industry
R&D.
To examine these issues we conducted a survey of
businesses that transfer-in technologies via license or
research agreements. The questionnaire was designed
to be answered by individuals actively engaged
in executing such agreements and focused on the
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

extent to which they had executed licenses, options,
and/or sponsored research agreements with universities between 1993-1997. We received responses from
112 business units that had licensed-in university
inventions. As described in Appendix C, ﬁrms in our
sample accounted for at least 15% of the license agreements and 17% of sponsored research agreements
reported by AUTM in 1997. Seventy-nine ﬁrms in the
sample responded to a question on the top ﬁve universities with whom they had contractual agreements.
The 85 universities mentioned include 35 of the top 50
universities in terms of industry-sponsored research
and 40 of the top 50 licensing universities in the 1997
AUTM survey. Slightly less than half the respondents
are responding for business units with no more than
100 employees, and about two thirds have fewer than
500 employees. The portion of small ﬁrms in our sample is in fact representative of all university licensing;
in 1998, the AUTM survey reported that 64% of all
university licenses were to start-ups or existing ﬁrms
with fewer than 500 employees. Sixty-three percent
of those who actively license-in from universities had
no more than $1,000,000 of revenues, and 20 of the
respondents reported that they did not have a product in the marketplace.
We asked respondents about changes in their relationship with universities, as well as the reasons
for any change. In particular, we asked whether
their contractual agreements (license, option, and/or
research agreements) with universities had increased,
decreased, or stayed about the same over the preceding ﬁve-year period. Of the 106 answering this question, 50% indicated an increase and 16% indicated
a decrease. For those with an increase or decrease
in arrangements we asked, on a 5-point scale with
1 indicating extremely important and 5 indicating not
important (a don’t know response was permitted), how
important a set of factors were in explaining the
change. Since there are so few respondents (17) indicating a decrease, we will not consider their reasons
for the decrease.
It is worth noting the magnitude of the changes
reported. For those noting an increase in agreements,
the number of licenses increased by 86% in 1997 compared to the average of the preceding four years, and
their research funding to universities doubled. On

average, each of these ﬁrms executed 13 licenses per
year and provided $13.2 mil in sponsored research
with U.S. universities.12
Table 2 gives the relative frequency of responses
regarding the reasons for the increase in their contracts. Table 3 gives unweighted and weighted average responses where the weights are the number of
licenses executed with universities over the period
1993–1997. The weighted averages are based on the
35 respondents who provided sufﬁcient information to calculate the number of licenses—these 35
respondents represent 409 university licenses over
this period. The ﬁrst three questions in Tables 2 and 3
relate to changes in universities, while the last two
relate to changes in corporate R&D.
Consider the two questions related to a business
unit’s research: “A change in our unit’s reliance on
external R&D”13 and “A change in the amount of
basic research conducted by our unit.” Approximately
60% and 41% indicated either a 1 or a 2 for Q4 (change
in reliance) and for Q5 (change in basic research),
respectively, suggesting that business demand for university technologies increased as a result of changes
in industry R&D. This, of course, does not rule out

the possibility (discussed below) that industry R&D
changed in response to university characteristics.
The ﬁrst three questions in Tables 2 and 3
relate to university characteristics: “Cost of university
research,” “Faculty research is more oriented toward
the needs of business,” and “A change in universities’
receptivity to licensing and/or research agreements.”
What stands out is the greater importance attached
to university receptivity than either costs or faculty
research orientation; three times as many respondents
recorded a 1 (extremely important) for university receptivity as recorded a 1 for costs or for faculty research.
We tested for signiﬁcant differences in responses
to the ﬁve questions. Our tests suggest a difference
signiﬁcant at the 1% level between responses to Q1
(cost) and Q3 (university receptivity) and to Q1 and
Q4 (reliance on external R&D). Responses to Q2 (faculty orientation) are also signiﬁcantly different from
those to Q3 and Q4 at signiﬁcance levels 1% and
10%, respectively. Responses to Q5 (basic research)
are signﬁcantly different from Q3 (10% level) and Q4
(5% level). No other distributions of responses are signiﬁcantly different.14 These tests further support the
14

12

Those who report decreased contracts indicated levels and
changes in levels that are of the same order of magnitude as those
who increased contracts.

13

Note that a change in a ﬁrm’s reliance on external R&D does not
necessarily reﬂect a change in their reliance on universities as only
47% of the licenses executed in 1997 by the ﬁrms in our sample are
with U.S. universities.

100

Because the responses are not independent, the test we use is a
test of difference in means where we take account of the dependence in computation of the variance of the difference in sample
means. In the case of independence a more appropriate test would
be to use tests for equivalence of the ﬁve-category multinomial
distributions (don’t know is excluded). The main differences in the
outcomes of the two tests is the non-signiﬁcance of Q5 from both
Q3 and Q4.

importance of changes in industry R&D and in university receptivity to contracts relative to costs and
changes in faculty orientation.
We also calculated simple correlations of the individual responses to the ﬁve questions. Not surprisingly, the correlation between Q4 and Q5, the questions related to changes in industry R&D, is fairly
high (0.6, signiﬁcant at the 1% level). To examine
whether changes in industrial R&D might be related
to university characteristics, we consider the correlations between responses to the R&D questions and
responses to the other three questions. Responses to
the cost question (Q1) have correlations of 0.49 (signiﬁcant at 1% level) and 0.45 (signiﬁcant at 5% level)
to Q4 and Q5, respectively. Neither Q2 (faculty orientation) nor Q3 (university receptivity) is signiﬁcantly
correlated with the R&D questions. Thus, while the
cost of university research is less important to overall increases in industry/university contracts than
changes in university receptivity to such contracts,
university cost is an important reason behind changes
in industry R&D. Finally, the correlation between Q2
and Q3 is 0.61 (signiﬁcant at the 1% level), implying that, while university receptivity to contracts is
more important than faculty orientation in explaining
changes in industry/university contacts, changes in
faculty orientation and changes in university receptivity to industry contracts go, to some extent, hand
in hand.
What do these results tell us about PROPu1 and
PROPu2 , the propensities of faculty and central administrations to commercialize inventions? First, our
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

earlier ﬁnding of substantial TFP growth in patent
applications indicated a substantial change in PROPu2 ,
and the survey results corroborate this as an important source of the growth in commercial activities
of universities. Second, we earlier noted that PROPu1
could change either through a reorientation of faculty
research toward the needs of business or through a
change in the willingness of faculty to disclose. The
industry survey suggests that, while there may have
been some reorientation of faculty research, a reorientation is much less important than changes in university receptivity and in industry R&D.
Finally, while we are not able through either
the productivity study or the survey to disentangle
the relative importance to the third stage (licenses
executed) of changes in TTO ability and knowledge (PROPu3 ) from market conditions (3 ), it would
appear that industry demand for university technologies has increased, at least in part, due to changes
in industry R&D. The latter changes are related to
the cost of university research rather than a reorientation of faculty or a change in university receptivity
to industry contracts.

Conclusion

We began this article with observations on substantial growth in disclosures, new patent applications,
and licenses executed. This increased activity has
prompted policy makers in government and academic circles to question the implications for faculty
research, and, in particular, whether faculty research
has become more applied in response to license
opportunities. This has been discussed in recent Congressional hearings as an “unintended” effect of the
Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. The act was intended not to
redirect faculty research, but to facilitate industrial
application of university research by expanding university rights to patent and license inventions from
federally funded research. To the extent that increased
licensing reﬂects a greater willingness of faculty
and university administrators to facilitate technology
transfer, the surge in licensing reﬂects the intended
effect of the legislation. While our analysis is intended
primarily to examine the sources of the dramatic
growth in licensing activity, it also contributes to the
policy debate.
101

<-----Page 12----->THURSBY AND THURSBY
Sources of Growth in University Licensing

In particular, we ﬁnd modest TFP growth in disclosures (2.7% annual growth), which could reﬂect
changes in faculty research or simply an increased
propensity to license as well as publish their work.
While our productivity analysis does not allow us to
separate the two, our industry survey suggests that
the modest growth in TFP of disclosures comes primarily from an increased willingness of faculty to
disclose. In indicating the reasons for their increased
interest in university inventions, survey respondents
weighted changes in their own reliance on external
R&D and increased university receptivity to industrial contracts more heavily than the orientation of
faculty research toward business needs. It is worth
noting that, while our evidence does not rule out
some shift in faculty focus, it is consistent with statistics on the split between basic and applied research
in U.S. universities as reported by universities to the
National Science Foundation (Science and Engineering
Indicators). The average proportion of basic research
to total research expenditures for 1977–1980 is 0.67,
while for 1994–1998 it is only 0.005 smaller. This difference represents about $119 mil of the more than $24
bil of research expenditures at all U.S. universities.
By far, the greatest growth in commercial activity is
in the second stage, patent applications. Patent applications could have grown because of an increase in
the propensity for university administrators to commercialize faculty inventions, but they could also
have grown because of the increase in disclosures.
While disclosures have increased, our productivity
analysis and industry survey also support the ﬁrst
explanation. That is, after accounting for input
growth, patent applications have grown substantially
(annual TFP growth of 12.1%), and this growth is
attributed to increasingly entrepreneurial university
administrators. Respondents to our industry survey
corroborate this result by placing a relatively high
weight on a change in university receptivity to industrial contracts as being important in the growth of
their university contracts. Here, again, our ﬁnding is
consistent with intended effects of the Bayh-Dole Act.
Perhaps the most surprising result is the negative
total TFP growth of licenses executed (−17% annual
growth). That is, growth in disclosures and patent
applications has been greater than the corresponding
102

growth in licenses executed. We interpret this to mean
that the marginal university innovation offered to the
market has declined in commercial appeal; universities are apparently delving more deeply into the available pool of innovations in their efforts to increase
their commercial activities. Again, delving deeply into
the available pool of innovations is consistent with
the intent of the Bayh-Dole Act.
Finally, we do not have evidence on the importance
of learning by doing on the part of TTOs except to
note our ﬁnding of a negative association between
TTO growth and TFP growth in licensing, which
would suggest at least the possibility of learning by
doing effects.

toward or away from frontiers in periods t and t + 1; it is growth

ratio is less than 1) of universities not on the frontier in at least one

period. The other term in (6.8) is the component of productivity
change that is due to frontier shifts between t and t + 1. This latter
term is said to represent technical change.
Efﬁciency results are based on the solution to the programming
problem given by Equations (6.1) through (6.4). TFP results are calculated using Equation (6.5).

The AUTM licensing survey (AUTM, various years) has data on
the technology transfer programs of many U.S. universities. In the
survey is information on the output of each of the three stages
(numbers of licenses executed, new patent applications, and invention disclosures) as well as the number of full-time equivalent staff
employed in the TTO and federal and industry research support.
These latter measures are the average level of support over the
preceding three years. For universities that did not respond to all
of the ﬁrst three years, we use the average support values for the
years in which they respond.
Data on faculty size and quality are from the National Research
Council’s (NRC 1995) 1993 survey of all Ph.D.-granting departments in the United States. No information is provided for departments that do not grant the Ph.D. degree. It is plausible to assume
that substantial research programs have difﬁculty existing in the
sciences and engineering—the departments from which 90% of
commercial activity originate (see Thursby et al. 2001)—without
the presence of Ph.D. students. We accept the reasonable proposition that science and engineering departments that do not grant the
Ph.D. are not strong research departments and, hence, provide less
inventive input to a university’s commercial activities; the AUTM
data support this proposition.
There are 64 universities with information sufﬁciently complete
to compute frontier production functions and growth rates.

Appendix C: Survey Design

The sample was drawn from the mailing list of Licensing Executive
Society, Inc. (United States and Canada). We phoned companies
with multiple entries to ensure a single response from each suitable
business unit and to identify the most appropriate respondent. Further calls allowed us to eliminate businesses that do not license-in
technology from any source or sponsor university research, as well
as ﬁrms that are no longer in business. This left us with 1,385 business units in the sample, and 300 responded (21.7% response rate);
112 indicated that they had licensed-in university technologies, and
188 indicated that their licenses were from other sources, although
61 of the latter had sponsored university research.
Many of the companies on the LES list are not publicly traded,
so it is impossible to conduct the usual tests for selectivity bias.
We can, however, compare the total of all licenses and industrysponsored research reported by AUTM to the number of licenses
and amount of sponsored research of our respondents. Of the 112
ﬁrms who licensed-in university technologies, 104 gave information on the number of their license agreements with universities.
These 104 respondents had 417 licenses in 1997, which represents
approximately 15% of the total reported by AUTM.16 Seventy-one

respondents reported $307 mil of support, which is approximately
17% of the comparable AUTM ﬁgure of $1,786 mil for 1997. If the
ﬁrms with missing sponsored research expenditures had the same
average research expenditure as the 71 usable responses, then our
114 respondents account for about 28% of all industry research support at U.S. universities. Seventy-nine ﬁrms listed the primary universities with whom they licensed during the preceding ﬁve years,
and 64 listed the primary universities with whom they sponsored
research.17 Eighty-ﬁve universities are mentioned (many are mentioned by a number of ﬁrms), and they cover most of the major U.S.
research universities; based on the 1997 AUTM survey, they represent 35 of the top 50 industry supported universities and 40 of the
top 50 licensing universities. It is reasonable to conclude that our
sample represents a substantial portion of all industry/university
contractual agreements of the recent past.

16

The survey is explicit in differentiating between licenses and
options, whereas AUTM lumps both together, thus our estimate
and the AUTM ﬁgure are not strictly comparable; however, the
bulk of university contracts (aside from research agreements) are
licenses. In our survey, licenses outnumbered options by about
4 to 1.

Many who did not answer this question indicated conﬁdentiality concerns. They were reluctant—in spite of assurances of
conﬁdentiality—because knowledge of the universities with whom
they deal can give competitors information as to the strategic direction the ﬁrm might take in the future.
