<-----Page 0----->Establishing Trust during the Formation
of Technology Alliances

ABSTRACT. Technological innovation occurs as much
between organizations as within. In such knowledge-sharing
alliances, interorganizational issues inﬂuence the alliance in
combination with interpersonal interactions. Calls for
establishing trust and trustworthiness often feature in alliance
research, but they can be elusive for managers. Using a case
study of the formation of a technological alliance in the
robotics industry, we illustrate a model and propositions
focused on partner search and alliance negotiation, linking
previously proposed trustworthiness categories with the
concepts of organizational justice. In particular, we suggest
that procedural justice in alliance formation may be more
important to alliance progression than perceptions of
distributive justice.

1. Introduction
In many technology alliances the requirement for
sharing of proprietary knowledge is widely recognized. This sharing is central to technology
transfer and commercialization as it creates both
the potential for signiﬁcant beneﬁts but also the
possibility of self-interested behavior by alliance
partners. At the point of alliance formation,
knowing when to ally will only partly be based
on the speciﬁc content or value of the technological knowledge that is to be transferred, shared or
created. Similarly, perceptions about their own
organization’s ability to absorb and utilize the
knowledge generated will be important (Kumar
and Nti, 1998) but will serve primarily to bring the

potential partners to the negotiating table. As Das
and Teng (1998, p. 491) argue, ‘‘given that is it
often impossible to identify who is likely to act
opportunistically, the interesting question is what
enables alliance partners to garner enough conﬁdence in partner cooperation so that they are not
overwhelmed by the potential hazards in alliances’’.
A major factor cited for overcoming concerns
about partner cooperation is interorganizational
trust—but often with limited elaboration—‘‘the
magic ingredient necessary for alliances to succeed’’ (Koza and Lewin, 1998, p. 259). While Das
and Teng (1998) discuss in detail the supplementary character of trust and control in generating
conﬁdence in partner cooperation, they focus on
four factors (risk taking, equity preservation,
communication and interﬁrm adaptation) that
relate to information that will primarily be
knowable once the alliance has been formed and
active for some period of time. Knowledge-based
trust formed from these sources is unlikely to have
developed prior to the alliance and so will not
directly inﬂuence the decision to enter into the
alliance, unless the potential partners have undertaken alliances together previously (McKnight et
al., 1998 note the need for time and an interaction
history if such trust is to develop). As a result, we
argue that a ﬁrm will make a decision to enter into
an alliance based on its assessment of the
trustworthiness of the potential partners, that is,
based on an attribute of other organizations and
their representatives rather than an attribute of the
future alliance relationship (trust).
So how do ﬁrms initially assess the trustworthiness of new potential partners? We propose that
key factors inﬂuencing these assessments emerge
during the alliance negotiations, with the individuals involved having a signiﬁcant impact. By
examining the process through which trustworthi-

ness perceptions develop early in the alliance
formation process, we seek to augment the platform provided by prior evolutionary research on
alliances (Ring and Van de Ven, 1994; Doz, 1996;
Kumar and Nti, 1998) and other treatments of
trust in alliances (e.g. Das and Teng, 1998). We
also address the agenda for further inquiry
indicated by Spekman et al. (1998, p. 760) where
‘‘in general, past research has ignored questions of
process’’.
The issue to be examined here is restricted to
assessments of trustworthiness during alliance
initiation, that is, the period of indecision, and
processes of decision, prior to the formation of a
technology alliance. We choose this focus because,
while trust is regarded as the ‘‘ubiquitous variable’’
in alliance research (Koza and Lewin, 1998), most
research to date has only considered direct
experience-based trust following alliance formation. We illustrate the decision process by drawing
on examples from a case study of a knowledgesharing technology alliance, as such a venture
presents many of the challenges to alliance
formation that trust is predicted to overcome.
The paper is organized as follows. First, knowledge-sharing technology alliances and a case
example are brieﬂy discussed. Next, the concepts
of interorganizational and interpersonal trust/
trustworthiness are reviewed and the development
of trustworthiness is linked to expectations and
perceptions of fairness. Propositions relating to the
antecedents of trustworthiness are then developed.
We conclude with a discussion of the implications
and limitations of this research.

2. Knowledge-sharing technology alliances
Interorganizational alliances and joint ventures are
not a new phenomenon, with the growth in
numbers of international alliances fuelled by
technological collaboration (e.g. Howells, 1990;
Hagedoorn, 1996) and especially where national
competitiveness might be at stake (see Casson,
1991; Mytelka, 1991). Much of the growth in
alliances, particularly in rapidly developing industries, has been in ‘‘supply-side’’ relationships, in
which access to technology, human capital and
distinctive organizational capabilities are the
primary motives (Powell et al., 1996; Shan et al.,

1994), in comparison to the more traditional (but
still dominant) ‘‘demand-side’’ alliances aimed
primarily at market control (Howells, 1990).
Such supply-side alliances have been described as
a ‘‘race to learn’’ (Hamel, 1990) and since
technology alliances, deﬁned as modes of cooperative activity ‘‘for which a combined innovative
activity or an interchange of technology is at least
part of the agreement’’ (Hagedoorn, 1996, p. 601)
often involve knowledge sharing between (potential) competitors, this can create additional concerns about forming an alliance.
Reﬂecting the growth in alliances in general,
research on this interorganizational form has also
increased in a range of branches of organizational
studies, including economics, management, public
administration and science and technology policy
(Hagedoorn et al., 2000). With respect to technology alliances, ‘‘[t]here is a vast literature that
attempts to explain, from a theoretical perspective,
why ﬁrms enter into formal research partnerships
and what are the results of such relationships to
the partners, industry and society at large’’
(Hagedoorn et al., 2000, p. 570). Generally,
‘‘transactions involving the sharing, exchange or
co-development of knowledge can be somewhat
problematic [ . . . and] in sum, alliances with an
R&D component are likely to have higher
transaction costs than those that don’t involve
joint R&D’’ (Gulati, 1995, pp. 90–91). As a result,
some assessment of the trustworthiness of potential partners is likely to occur prior to alliance
formation. We seek to address the factors that
affect this assessment of trustworthiness, particularly in the case where the partners have no prior
relationship (either directly or through their network of trusted others).
We use the case of a technology alliance to
illustrate the propositions that we develop. The
shiny robot venture (SRV) was formed between six
organizations (% shareholding given in parentheses); a public sector research institute (16%), an
industry funding body (51%, because they owned
the robot prototype), and four smaller partners
(8% each). While the research institute had
developed some valuable intellectual property, it
required other partners with different skills to
successfully commercialize the robot and, thus, it
played the lead role in organizing and brokering
the alliance. Its mandate was to operate ‘‘to the

<-----Page 2----->Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances

beneﬁt of New Zealand’’ which included having
the technology commercialized successfully, allowing the institute to further justify its relevance to
industry and government. Determining the shareholding in SRV proved to be the ﬁrst and a critical
challenge in forming the alliance. Interviews with
four of the partners were undertaken shortly after
the formation of the alliance, giving four organizational and 15 individual perspectives on the key
aspects of the formation process.
A full case study of the joint venture was
prepared from the interview material (Hubbard et
al., 1999). A synopsis focusing speciﬁcally on the
formation of SRV, from the perspectives of one of
the partners to the negotiation, is given below:
In 1996, a proposal was circulating in the New
Zealand meat industry looking for potential partners
to further develop a new robotics product. A public
sector research institute had initially developed the
technology and it was now seeking partners to bring
the product to market. The technology looked
promising to John Brown [name disguised], the
CEO of a small ﬁrm that could deﬁnitely contribute
componentry to the production of the robot. Brown
also knew one of the potential partners, an industry
funding body that his ﬁrm had worked with before.
Being associated with the industry funding body, and
the research institute for that matter, in such a
venture would create positive beneﬁts for the reputation of the smaller ﬁrms involved.
Through his network of contacts in other companies, Brown was able to ﬁnd out some information
about the other ﬁrms that would potentially be
involved. Most had good reputations for high quality
work in their industry both locally and, for some,
internationally. One was a recent entrepreneurial
start-up but was rapidly becoming known for some
very innovative engineering development. The potential to work more closely with one or more of these
ﬁrms on other projects also existed and had also
attracted all of the potential partners to consider SRV.
While the technology and the business opportunity
looked attractive based on the business case presented
and the information available about the other
partners suggested they were trustworthy, Brown
had a lingering concern about the relative size of the
partners. Would the larger research institute dominate
the smaller partners? Would his ﬁrm be able to have its
say in the management of the venture, its future
development as well as reap rewards fairly?
Over the next six months, Brown’s fears were
largely allayed by the efforts of the joint venture

189

manager at the institute. This manager went to
considerable lengths to facilitate interactions between
the ﬁrms, and to consult and work with each of the
potential partners on the share value that any previous
and, in Brown’s case, potential future contributions
would represent. Brown was impressed with the
process that the manager employed to make sure
that each potential partner was satisﬁed with the
proposed governance structure. As a result, Brown
now felt that he was ready to trust these people and to
sign over his share of the investment capital.

This synopsis captures many of the factors that
we believe affect trustworthiness assessments during alliance formation and, from which, our
research propositions will ﬂow.

3. Trust and trustworthiness
Trust is recognized as essential for cooperative
behavior (Chan, 1997; Kim and Mauborgne, 1998)
and the operation of network forms of organization (Creed and Miles, 1996). It is also perceived to
have a complementary and supplementary role
relative to the use of controls (Das and Teng,
1998). Numerous deﬁnitions of trust have been
proposed, with most referring to a combination of
expectation and vulnerability. The lack of consensus on a deﬁnition is reﬂected in the range of
interpretations of the concept, from the more
speciﬁc approaches, such as that taken in economics (Das and Teng, 1998), in which trust is deﬁned
as ‘‘an expectation, and it pertains to circumstances in which agents take risky actions in
environments characterized by uncertainty or
informational incompleteness’’ (James, 2002,
p. 291), to very broad deﬁnitions such as ‘‘conﬁdence in the goodwill of others’’ (Ring and Van
de Ven, 1994, p. 93). We draw on an intermediate
approach to trust as it pertains to alliances such
that it reﬂects the expectation that partners will act
competently and recognize and protect the interests of other alliance members.
Trust is an attribute of a relationship (Barney
and Hansen, 1994) between partners. Partners are
deﬁned as independent organizations that participate in cooperative alliance agreements ‘‘which are
not connected through (majority) ownership’’
(Hagedoorn, 1996, p. 615). Whilst much of the

<-----Page 3----->190

Daellenbach and Davenport

alliance literature, and the ownership criterion
given above, imply that partner organizations
come from the private sector, partners in technology alliances will frequently span several sectors
including public or not-for proﬁt organizations as
illustrated by the case study used in this paper.
Trust, however, may or may not be present at
the beginning of the relationship (Flores and
Solomon, 1998). With prior experience of relationships with a potential partner, trust may already
exist between organizations as interorganizational
trust is incrementally built as ﬁrms repeatedly
interact (Gulati, 1995; Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999)
and mutually adjust to the prior alliance’s
expectations, evolution and demands (Doz,
1996). However, without prior experience of an
unknown or untried partner, how does trust
develop? The initiation of trust begins by assessing
the trustworthiness of the potential partner (Sheppard and Sherman, 1998) during the initiation
stage of interorganizational alliances, here, referring to partner search and negotiations (Ring and
van de Ven, 1994; Spekman et al., 1998). In
contrast to trust, trustworthiness is an attribute of
individual exchange partners (Barney and Hansen,
1994) and deﬁned as the ‘‘compound virtue of
being dependable, capable, responsive and responsible’’ (Flores and Solomon, 1998, p. 209).
Trustworthiness inspires trust and trust(ing) presupposes trustworthiness.
As a result, part of the process of partner
identiﬁcation at the inception of an alliance will
involve an assessment of whether the potential
partner intends to, and will be able to, act fairly
with respect to developing and managing the
technology, sharing costs, and distributing returns.
Through such an assessment, expectations will be
created not only of the technology outcomes to be
transferred/shared but also how transfer, sharing
and management are likely to be handled and
evolve. The creation of these expectations prior to
alliance formation is likely to be critical to whether
that alliance will proceed and which potential
partners will choose to join.
Typically, the collaborative behavior that is the
subject of trust research is that which occurs
between individuals. Our interest in trust, though,
is also in the trust that forms between organizations. Whilst this usually still involves trust
between individuals—the relationships between

ﬁrms are rarely faceless and monolithic, since
they are actively handled and managed by
individual boundary spanners (Zaheer et al.,
1998)—there is the added dimension of the
organization as an entity and its behavior in the
formation of such trust. Zaheer et al. (1998)
provide evidence that interpersonal and interorganizational trust are distinct but positively related.
Their study, however, examined the evolution of,
rather than the initial formation of, interpersonal
and interorganizational trust. Furthermore, in
ﬁnding that interorganizational trust was associated with higher perceptions of supplier performance and helped to reduce conﬂict and
negotiation costs between buyers and suppliers,
whereas interpersonal trust was not associated
with such beneﬁts (Zaheer et al., 1998), there
appear to be advantages in developing interorganizational trust early in an alliance. We propose
that such trust in new alliance partners will
initially be based on each partner’s assessments
of trustworthiness of the other partners.
Previous research suggests that assessments of
trust and trustworthiness are likely to be based
initially on the personal interactions of boundary
spanning individuals (Katz and Kahn, 1978).
Boundary spanners play a crucial role because of
the frequency and depth of their social interactions
with potential partners (Friedman and Podolny,
1992). The behavior and actions of these individuals provide key signals about the organization
that they represent and, in particular, the extent to
which a trustor perceives an organization as
trustworthy. Williams (2001) proposes that assessments of trustworthiness of individuals and groups
will be formed from category-based beliefs (about
ability, integrity and benevolence) and affect for
outgroups (partners). Ability refers to the set of
skills or competencies that the partner has in a
particular area; integrity to the belief that a
partner will adhere to a set of principles that are
perceived to be acceptable; benevolence to an
other-oriented desire to do good for the partner;
and affect to feelings, affective attachments and
affective states (Williams, 2001). In the context of
alliance formation, we argue that ability will form
the primary criterion for assessing trustworthiness
during partner search, whereas it is not until
alliance negotiation that other category-based
beliefs and feelings can be assessed. These beliefs

<-----Page 4----->Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances

and feelings will depend heavily on how the
negotiation and management processes used by
the boundary spanners are perceived, as these
processes represent the ﬁrst forum in which the
potential partners interact.

4. Antecedents of trustworthiness
The gathering of information about trustworthiness during partner search and negotiations is
effectively based on a concern for fair dealing
(Ring and van de Ven, 1994). For example, Jones
and George (1998, p. 535) note that ‘‘joint creation
of a social situation involves each party trying to
understand the other party’s expectations, needs,
and goals.’’ Perceptions of fairness are created and
evolve as a result of these social experiences and,
initially, are likely to be synonymous with perceptions of justice in an interaction, relationship or
institution (Lind and Tyler, 1988). Individuals
have historically been viewed as evaluating such
social experiences by the outcomes/rewards they
received, forming perceptions of distributive justice. However, more recent research in social
psychology has focused on procedural justice,
which envisages a person, in some situations,
being more interested in issues of process rather
than outcome (e.g. Welbourne, 1998). Thus, the
form of the social interaction may be equally, and
in some cases more, important than the outcome
(Lind and Tyler, 1988).
To date, the roles of distributive and procedural
justice in interorganizational relationships have
only been inherent in most of the alliance literature
(e.g. Das and Teng, 1998), particularly observed in
explaining the demise of alliances (Doz, 1996).
Kumar and Nti (1998) raise the role of organizational justice concepts as explanatory factors for
differential learning in alliances. They argue that
perceptions of procedural justice are particularly
important in stimulating the higher order attitudes
of commitment, trust and social harmony between
partners and thus managerial psychological
attachment to the alliance. Similarly, Johnson
(1997) reports that procedural justice perceptions
impact upon partners’ evolving commitment to
joint ventures.
Procedural justice has also been found to be
particularly salient when new organizations are

191

being created. Lind and Tyler (1988) argue for the
ubiquity of the concept in that ‘‘procedural justice
phenomena appear in much the same form in a
wide variety of social settings’’ and that ‘‘many of
the same factors determine whether a procedure is
seen as fair, regardless of the context’’ (1988, p.
129). As procedural justice has been found to be a
signiﬁcant predictor of trust (Kim and Mauborgne, 1998, p. 136), it is likely that perceptions
of organizational justice will be a major determinant in any assessment of trustworthiness. Thus in
the following discussion, we focus primarily on
how expectations and perceptions of procedural
and distributive justice may result during partner
search and negotiation. Our model of the antecedent factors is given in Figure 1. In discussing
these different factors, we introduce examples
from the case study at the beginning of each
subsection as an illustration of alliance partner
concerns during alliance formation.

Antecedents of trustworthiness during partner
search
Previous studies have identiﬁed three factors
affecting assessments of trustworthiness that will
be relevant during the search for potential partners
(prior experience with the partner, the potential
partner’s reputation in networks of trusted others,
and conditional trust). The ﬁrst two of these have
been studied extensively and so are only included
here to provide a complete discussion of how
trustworthiness assessments are likely to be
formed. Our focus, though, is on how these
assessments are made when the partners have no,
or at most very limited, knowledge and experience
with each other and so we discuss the nature of
conditional trust in more detail.
Prior experience. We’d worked a bit with [one of the
smaller partners], just a bit. [ . . . ] We’re faithful to the
people who have supported us as well. (Owner, one
of the smaller shareholders)

When a ﬁrm has prior experience of collaborating
with a potential partner, procedural norms would
have already been established (Gulati, 1995) and
any trust that exists will be knowledge-based
(Shapiro et al., 1992), creating perceptions of
trustworthiness as indicated in the statement

<-----Page 5----->192

Daellenbach and Davenport

Figure 1. Factors affecting trustworthiness assessments during alliance formation.

above. Even if the previous alliance(s) did not
result in all of the expected outcomes, if procedural justice was perceived as being high due to
effective procedural norms, the ﬁrm may still have
been satisﬁed enough with the strategic alliance as
a whole and trust that similar norms would
operate in future relationships.
Reputation. I knew most of the other partners. I was
aware of, although I didn’t know [one potential
partner]. I had met him on one occasion and I was
aware of his history and what he’d done. (Owner, one
of the smaller shareholders)

When there is no direct prior experience with a
partner, perceptions about the norms and standards
of procedural and distributive justice are likely to be
ﬁrstly derived from, and endorsed by, the network
of organizations from which the organization
gathers information about the prospective partner.
In this case, a ﬁrm’s reputation for trustworthiness
acts as a proxy for shared collaborative history
(Parkhe, 1993). Under their ‘‘group value’’ model of
procedural justice, Lind and Tyler (1988) suggest
that the group will construct norms of treatment
and decision making that regulate the group’s
structure and process so that when procedures are
in accord with the fundamental values of the group,
a sense of procedural justice results. If it is assumed
that such a process also happens within a group or
network of organizations, then a prospective

partner’s history of having previously conformed
to the norms and beliefs of procedural justice may
be relayed via the network interrogation process
(e.g. Hill, 1990). Thus, within the network,
an organization’s reputation for fair (or unfair)
process will provide a key indicator of their
trustworthiness.
A secondary aspect to this is the credibility of
the source of the information on a ﬁrm’s reputation for trustworthiness. The tendency to use prior
partners as ﬁrst choice options for future alliances
(Gulati, 1999; Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999) suggests
that individuals within these ﬁrms will represent
the preferred source for information on others.
Information from trusted previous relationships,
particularly those with direct linkages to the new
potential partner, will be actively sought out and
potentially be treated in a manner similar to the
ﬁrm having had a direct linkage itself. This is less
likely when the information on reputations is
received from a source that is trusted, but not yet
unconditionally.
Conditional trust. To a large degree, we went and
approached people that we felt could contribute.
[ . . . ] What we wanted to do was to get a group of
companies together where between them you had all
the expertise and experience you were going to need
to make this thing a success. (Manager, technology
research institute)

<-----Page 6----->Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances

It was presented that it was a reasonably good sort of
business opportunity. (Owner, one of the smaller
shareholders)
[The] actual association with complementary companies was a signiﬁcant factor in my decision making
and it’s proven to be so. (Owner, one of the smaller
shareholders)

How does an initial assessment arise when neither
prior experience nor reputation provide suitable
knowledge? In such cases, Jones and George
(1998) suggest that the potential partners may
initially suspend belief about the others’ actual
trustworthiness and assume that the other ﬁrm can
be conditionally trusted. This does not imply blind
faith in the other ﬁrm to be trustworthy. Rather,
‘‘as Luhmann (1980) suggests, trusting and assuming the other shares one’s own values is often
preferred to initial distrust, since trust is the easier
option’’ (Jones and George, 1998, p. 535) due to
the costs of assuming or proving otherwise. Some
research suggests that an initial intention to trust is
not so much based on evidence, but on a lack of
contrary evidence (e.g. Gambetta, 1988; McKnight
et al., 1998).
Based on the categories of trustworthiness
assessments discussed by Williams (2001), we
suggest that during partner search assessments
are likely to primarily focus on the potential
partner’s ability. At this point of alliance formation, few details of the alliance will have been
discussed or ﬁnalized and information will be
available primarily on each partner’s capabilities
and past market or ﬁnancial performance. Some
information on the potential costs, risks and
beneﬁts of the proposed alliance and activities to
be undertaken will also have been presented. In
these circumstances, more capable partners are
likely to be perceived as more trustworthy, relying
on these ﬁrms’ professionalism and potentially
threats to reputation to initially facilitate trustworthy behavior. For example, while the research
institute initially focused on potential partner’s
skills and capabilities, the smaller partners relied
on the business case presented and the prestige of
working with the larger organizations as an
indication of whether to pursue the alliance
negotiations further. Conversely, information on
integrity and benevolence would require a ﬁrm’s
network to have knowledge about the potential

193

partner, which, if available, would eliminate the
need to start from a position of conditional trust.
Thus,
Proposition 1: During partner search, a ﬁrm will
assume a position of conditional trust with respect to
a completely unknown but capable potential partner,
that is, a favorable enough assessment for
negotiation of the potential alliance to take place.
Assumptions of conditional trust will hinge on the
partner’s ability.
Antecedents of trustworthiness during negotiations
The expanded interactions associated with negotiating the alliance contract present a key difference relative to partner search stage, allowing
initial assessments of trustworthiness based on
prior experience, reputation, and conditional trust
in particular to be updated. These interactions will
also facilitate the development of perceptions
relating to other categories of trustworthiness,
such as integrity, benevolence and affect.
Perceptions of procedural justice. There was an issue
of control of the company if you like. [ . . . ] But it
wasn’t as if it was an acrimonious negotiation. I think
the general intent of the negotiations was one of
cooperation and building a team of people. (Owner,
one of the smaller shareholders)
[ . . . ] how they handled it from the start—I think they
did it very successfully, bringing a group of people
together and sitting back and seeing how they
interacted. (Owner, one of the smaller shareholders)
I think personalities make a hell of a difference. I
mean, the dynamics of the group and their personalities has been very, very important. That was
obvious right from setup and the ﬁrst meeting.
(Owner, one of the smaller shareholders)

While it is acknowledged as a complex relationship, several studies have shown that judgments of
procedural justice play a key role in enhancing
performance-related attitudes and behavior (Lind
and Tyler, 1988; Welbourne, 1998). Korine (1998),
for example, found that procedural justice in
business unit management and team decisionmaking were shown to relate, respectively, to
customer and product measures of team performance. This result mirrors the research that has, in
general, borne out the positive relationship

<-----Page 7----->194

Daellenbach and Davenport

between perceived distributive justice and performance (Alexander and Ruderman, 1987; McFarlin
and Sweeney, 1992). Therefore, it is expected that
perceived procedural justice within technology
alliances would correlate with improved alliance
performance and outcomes. In turn, perceptions
prior to the alliance, that procedural justice will be
adhered to during the alliance, should also provide
key signals of the trustworthiness of a partner.
During alliance negotiations, such perceptions
will shift from primarily considering a partner’s
ability, to also address integrity, benevolence and
affective states. From our case study, perceptions
of procedural justice in the negotiation stage were
prominent. These included satisfaction with the
adoption of a cooperative, team-building focus
across the partnership and allowing time for
interaction and the development of shared norms.
The six months it took to negotiate the agreement
provided the possibility for extensive consultation
and meetings and also presented an opportunity
for personal ties to form. While information on
each partner’s abilities was undoubtedly being
assessed, there was a clear shift to more directly
assessing trustworthiness through considering how
the negotiation process was being handled and
how it was responding to concerns raised by the
different partners. Thus, we propose that:
Proposition 2a: Assessment of the trustworthiness
of the potential partner will be positively related to
perceptions of procedural justice during the
negotiation of the alliance. Integrity, benevolence
and affect will be the primary categories on which
procedural justice is assessed.
Perceptions of distributive justice. There’s an acceptance that, okay, [the research institute] has done that
[the R&D on the prototype] and they’ve got a bigger
chunk of the company than the rest of us. Fair
enough—but I didn’t feel comfortable with the fact
that, for example, they and perhaps one other of the
smaller partners could have outvoted the other three
smaller partners. Because, I think in terms of
commercial success, the smaller partners have probably actually got a bigger part to play in the company
than [the research institute] has. (Owner, one of the
smaller shareholders)
We would have taken whatever percentage came our
way at some level because there was an opportunity
there. (Owner, one of the smaller shareholders)

Although we have emphasized the role of procedural justice, this is not to suggest that distributive
justice expectations do not play a role in assessing
trustworthiness. A key difference, though, is that
assessments of distributive justice typically remain
as expectations until well after the formation of the
alliance, since the knowledge outcomes will require
time to develop. In contrast, the determination of
procedural norms begins during the negotiations
and there is an opportunity to assess if process
discrepancies (are likely to) arise. The initial
conditions framing an alliance play a key role in
whether it becomes successful or unsuccessful
(Doz, 1996) and so initial levels of (dis-)satisfaction with procedures may shape future interactions
between the alliance partners.
Historically, it was thought that fairness judgments resulted from expectations that particular
outcomes usually accompany particular procedures (Lind and Tyler, 1988). It was assumed
that attitudes and behavior regarding social
experiences could be explained either through the
level of outcomes relative to expectations or
relative to norms of fair distribution. This was
apparent in the SRV case with concerns surfacing
over percentage ownership, centering around the
skills and abilities that were needed to progress the
venture—that is, seeking both recognition and
rewards for the contribution that the smaller
partners would make and ensuring that they had
enough ownership to inﬂuence future decisions
and direction of the alliance. These concerns were
unlikely to have halted the formation of the
alliance completely, although, if they had not
been addressed, perceptions of procedural and
distributive injustice may have derailed the alliance
at a later stage.
As this suggests, the process used to address
these shareholder concerns was important. More
generally, higher distributive fairness judgments
are associated with perceptions of procedural
justice, that is an ‘‘enhancement of perceived
fairness of outcomes and concomitant satisfaction’’ is observed when procedures engender
perceptions of procedural justice (Lind and Tyler,
1988, p. 186). However, the distinct nature of
procedural justice has been hypothesized from
observations that process dissatisfaction could
occur even when favorable outcomes were
obtained and, in the converse situation, percep-

<-----Page 8----->Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances

tions of fair process can enhance satisfaction with
an interaction even when outcomes are not
favorable. In fact, it has been noted that ‘‘the use
of a fair procedure can increase the satisfaction of
all concerned without any increase in the real
outcomes available for distribution’’ (Lind and
Tyler, 1988, p. 29). Overall, process judgments are
likely to have an important inﬂuence on perceptions of distributive justice (Robbins et al., 2000).
Kumar and Nti (1998) also make the distinction
between procedural and distributive justice when
describing four scenarios in which favorable or
unfavorable process and outcome discrepancies
are matched with the stability of the alliance. They
proceed to argue that as an unfavorable process
discrepancy is harder to assess and may require the
partners to change behavior or to modify the
implicit contracts and norms governing the alliance relationship, then this will create more
instability in the partnership. Similarly, we argue
that the consequences of perceived procedural
injustice during the initiation stages on alliance
formation are likely to be greater than distributive
injustice in the decision to enter an alliance. In
summary,
Proposition 2b: During the negotiation of the
alliance, assessment of the trustworthiness of the
potential partner will be positively related to an
expectation of distributive justice following alliance
formation and completion. Ability will be the
primary category on which distributive justice is
assessed.
and
Proposition 2c: Perceptions of distributive justice
will also be positively related to perceptions of
procedural justice. During the negotiation of the
alliance, assessment of the trustworthiness of a
potential partner will depend more heavily on
perceived procedural justice than on an expectation
of distributive justice.
Power and organizational justice. [We], the other
smaller shareholders and myself, saw it as being
essential that three smaller shareholders couldn’t be
outvoted by [the research institute]. [ . . . ] not an
equal say because of the structure, but at least that
[the research institute] itself couldn’t have the
controlling vote above all the smaller shareholders

195

together or even with one of them. (Owner, one of the
smaller shareholders)
That process took about four months, okay. I mean
it started off as a whole lot of stuff about how it was
going to structured [ . . . ]. Essentially, from our point
of view, we only had one requirement and that was
that we had 51% of the shareholding—a controlling
interest and everybody seemed pretty relaxed about
that and it was really just a matter of working out on
what basis the company was going to operate and
that sort of stuff. And really the question was what
sort of shareholding [the research institute] was going
to have. Because it seemed that while most of the
other partners could accept [that we] should have the
majority shareholding because [we] owned the
technology, what they didn’t want to have was
another big brother—two big brothers in the same
company. So there was a lot of discussion about ‘how
many little people does it take to outvote one big
person sort of thing’? (Manager, industry funding
body)

One of the major consequences of perceptions of
procedural justice is on compliance, that is, fair
procedures lead to greater compliance with the
decision with which they are associated. Once
again, the converse situation reinforces this effect.
Unfair procedures lead to higher levels of disobedience and to more efﬁcient and clever disobedience, than do fair procedures (Lind and Tyler,
1988). Perceptions of procedural justice are,
though, further complicated by the power relationship between the partners, as the use of power
tends to be a non-cooperative activity. As a result,
the non-compliance effect of unfair procedures is
likely to be magniﬁed when those in power use
rules exploitatively.
The abuse of power with respect to procedural
justice sometimes results in a rare ‘‘frustration
effect’’ (Lind and Tyler, 1988). Lower distributive
fairness or satisfaction is observed under ostensibly fair procedures when participants perceive
that the procedure is corrupt—for example, if it
appears that the procedure is being manipulated to
mask personal gain behind a facade of procedural
justice (Lind and Tyler, 1988). Other instances of
this effect have been seen when the participants
believe that consultation (or ‘‘voice’’) procedures
are an insincere attempt to give the process the
illusion of fairness rather than a genuine effort to
solicit views. Thus, the power balance between

<-----Page 9----->196

Daellenbach and Davenport

partners may affect the perceptions and expectations of whether procedural and distributive justice
are likely to be forthcoming in the future relationship.
Interestingly, the use of power may be more
legitimate during the negotiation of an alliance. As
Das and Teng (1998, p. 504) note ‘‘equity means
that the ﬁrm contributing the most resources (both
tangible and intangible) to the alliance should get
the most from it [ . . . ] Should partners become
concerned about potential inequities in proﬁt
distribution, for instance, their conﬁdence in and
commitment to the alliance will most likely recede,
even if the alliances are about to bring about
positive results’’. This suggests that while negotiating the alliance, it will be necessary to push hard
for a good deal for one’s own organization.
Otherwise, settling for a smaller share of the
outcomes would cause expectations of distributive
justice to be lowered for that partner. Using one’s
relative power to get the right deal will probably,
at worst, have a limited effect on expectations of
distributive justice. It may even enhance it if it
leads to heightened communication, which in turn
may facilitate the generation of understanding and
shared values in the alliance.
Conversely, the use of power with respect to
determining procedures will not be seen as
legitimate. As Yan and Gray (1994) found, the
controls adopted in the joint ventures they studied
were dictated by the partner with the highest
bargaining power, and in one case (of four) where
the balance was particularly skewed, this imbalance in management controls appears to have
affected the low performance perceived by the less
powerful partner. Reardon and Spekman (1994)
also note that power needs to be used carefully in
the negotiations stage, advocating mechanisms
that facilitate communication and empower all
parties. In the robotics alliance, the process
through which the research institute conducted
the negotiations gave the smaller partners voice in
the alliance contract, providing them with some
degree of control over future decisions, and
indicating that their viewpoints would be considered. Overall, the arguments presented suggest
that:
Proposition 3a: During the negotiation of the
alliance, the use of power by a ﬁrm to determine

the alliance management and control procedures will
lead to lower perceptions and expectations of
procedural justice for the potential partners.
Proposition 3b: During the negotiation of the
alliance, the use of power by a ﬁrm to determine
the future distribution of outcomes from the alliance
will have no direct effect on expectations of
distributive justice by the potential partners.

5. Discussion
We implicitly and totally trust [the research institute]
that we deal with today. We wouldn’t even worry
about a contract with them in an important thing, we
just act on their word. I think it goes the other way. I
hope it does. (Owner, one of the smaller partners)

We have proposed that the assessment of the
trustworthiness of a potential partner evolves
during the initiation of an alliance. During the
search for partners, knowledge developed from
prior experience with that partner and its reputation for fair dealing in the ﬁrm’s network of
trusted others will be the preferred bases for
assessing the trustworthiness of a partner. Where
neither of these is available, Jones and George
(1998) suggest that ﬁrms are likely to assume an
initial conditional trust stance, which will be
revised during subsequent stages of the alliance.
Furthermore, we suggest that during partner
search, assessments of trustworthiness relating to
new or unknown partners will be based on the
known abilities of that partner, relying on the
negotiations of the alliance contract to provide
both additional signals of trustworthiness and
some security against opportunistic behavior.
For potential partners where no direct prior
relationship exists, knowledge-based trusting
(Shapiro et al., 1992) only begins to develop
during negotiations because this stage provides
the ﬁrst substantive opportunity for the ﬁrms to
interact with one another. Negotiation of the
alliance is thus a key stage, setting the platform for
both understanding and/or misunderstanding. The
interactions of negotiations also make it possible
to include assessments on additional categories of
trustworthiness—giving signals about the integrity
and benevolence of partners, and creating a forum
for social ties to develop. The negotiation stage is

<-----Page 10----->Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances

the ﬁrst time when process discrepancies may arise.
As a result, perceptions of procedural justice will
be the major determinant of assessments of
trustworthiness at this point.
Given the key role that procedural justice is
likely to play in shaping trustworthiness during
negotiations with new partners, it would seem
prudent to choose those individuals involved in the
negotiations carefully. If trust is based on expectations held in common about the terms of an
exchange relationship, as proposed by Zucker
(1986), then perceived integrity will become
increasingly important to assessments of trustworthiness. As was epitomized in the efforts of the
manager from the public sector research institute
in our case study, the negotiator has to act as an
‘‘honest broker’’, a role that has been suggested as
appropriate for governmental actors in partnership formations (Leyden and Link, 1999). However, in our case the negotiator represented one of
the potential partners that just happened to be a
governmental organization. Whether the presence
of an external negotiator, for example, one
appointed by government to act in this capacity,
would impact on the organizational justice perceptions would be an interesting question. It could be
surmised that the presence of an external negotiator, who is present solely for the formation
phase, may not encourage the development of
procedural justice bases for trust and trustworthiness assessments that would be needed to underpin
the ongoing alliance relationship.
It is likely that trust and trustworthiness
assessments during alliance formation will be
interpersonal (vs. interorganizational) in nature,
with the interactions between the respective
negotiators determining whether trusting forms
part of the initial conditions for the alliance.
Reardon and Spekman (1994) echo the call for
careful selection of negotiators. They also advocate distributing power to the advantage of all
alliance partners. Proactively taking such steps
during the early interactions of the negotiation
process could well help to set the stage for the
development of a trusting relationship that has
been cited as the key to successful knowledgesharing alliances. Conversely, without the active
development of perceptions of procedural and
distributive justice, conditional trust may well slip
into distrust.

197

In developing our propositions above, we have
assumed that a common perception of what
constitutes fair process will exist or can be created
across the potential partners, but this will not
necessarily be the case at the outset. Efforts at
creating procedural justice evoke a sense of
obligation as a precursor to trust (Sheppard and
Sherman, 1998). However, when one or more of
the partners approaches the alliance with a
different view of what constitutes appropriate
process, the likelihood of fairness being perceived,
and hence the assessment of trustworthiness, will
inevitably be affected. For example, a more
traditional transaction cost perspective on justice,
based on extensive contractual negotiation with
strong punitive sanctions, will inﬂuence the assessment of trustworthiness (Sitkin and Roth, 1993).
The transaction cost approach to justice, which is
based on the assumption of self-interested opportunism and coercive control, can be viewed as a
pessimistic approach to a relationship—for example, by shifting voluntary compliance based on
trust to compulsory compliance (Ghoshal and
Moran, 1996). In the extreme, a potential partner
could perceive such an approach as the antithesis
of trustworthy behavior based on fairness and,
therefore, it may inﬂuence their intention to enter
into or contribute to the alliance.
Similarly, as was true for the alliance in our case
study, the presence of inexperienced alliance
partners (that is, ﬁrms that have not been in any
(or many) alliances) may leave them particularly
wary of procedures that experienced ﬁrms take for
granted when establishing a new alliance. Individuals within organizations can approach alliance
situations with the view that accepted procedures
within their organizations are valid and legitimate
in the alliance as well. While these procedures may
be fair, the process of adopting them will require
care. Thus, the research institute in our case went
to extra effort and provided additional training for
some new alliance partners in order to familiarize
them with the governance procedures to be used
and their role in strategic decision-making in the
alliance. Another source of differences in perceptions of the appropriateness of procedures and
their fairness arises from substantial size differences across the partners. Overall, the potential for
perceiving processes to be unfair suggests that
organizations must pay particular attention to

<-----Page 11----->198

Daellenbach and Davenport

creating the right conditions for cooperation
(Gambetta, 1988).
The dispositional tendencies of the potential
partners (Brockner and Siegel, 1996), that is,
whether they are predisposed to more or less
trusting behavior and how this predisposition is
realized, which may be a function of prior
experiences of fair treatment or otherwise, will
also inﬂuence the assessment of trustworthiness
and the intention to trust (McKnight et al., 1998).
Disposition is argued to be particularly important
when the interaction is between unfamiliar actors
(Bigley and Pearce, 1998), such as a new alliance
with unknown partners. In such cases, institutional frameworks provide situational factors and
social mechanisms (such as procedural norms) that
foster trust and trustworthiness (Bigley and
Pearce, 1998). However, can we translate the
disposition to trust, as an inherently individual
concept, to an organizational disposition to trust?
(Hagen and Choe, 1998).
While we have indicated the importance of
prior experience in the assessment of trustworthiness, even a tried partner may not remain
trustworthy. This situation could arise when the
prior experience with the potential partner is based
on an interaction that took place some time in the
past. As a result, the inﬂuence of prior experience
on the assessment of trustworthiness may be
temporal in nature. For example, the partner
organization may ostensibly be the same, but have
evolved such that different individuals are
involved in the actual inter-organizational negotiations and interactions. There is no doubt that
the characteristics and personalities of the boundary spanners involved will inﬂuence the perception
of trustworthiness (Zaheer et al., 1998) but this
may be at odds with any lingering organizationlevel perception of organizational trustworthiness
from previous interactions. Such an imbalance
may moderate the trustworthiness assessment,
which will depend on the level of surveillance of
trustworthiness behavior between previous and
potential interactions.
When the surveillance in the interim has been
low, the organization may place more weight on
the knowledge embedded in the network of trusted
others. However, the network may not espouse a
singular view of the reputation of the potential
partner, particularly if that organization is not

central in the network, that is, when weak ties
exist. Individual network members may also have
memories of differing experiences of the trustworthiness of the potential partner. Thus, the
knowledge gained from the network will depend
on the number of trusted others that have knowledge through prior experience, and these may not
lead to a clear assessment of trustworthiness.
Surveillance of the potential partner within a
network will also depend on the status or
centrality of that organization, as well as network
density (Brass et al., 1998).
All of these examples focus attention on how
the organization weights the relative inﬂuences
when creating its assessment, and how such
implicit weightings change in different circumstances or over time. Other issues associated with
relative weightings arise when the potential alliance is not a simple dyad, that is, when there are
multiple potential partners. As in the robotics
alliance, each organization has to make an
assessment of the trustworthiness of every other
partner, and balance the inﬂuence of the different
trustworthiness assessment categories for each
partner. Does, for example, the organization focus
primarily on assessing the trustworthiness of the
powerful partners, assuming that the more powerful partners will have a greater inﬂuence on
procedural justice? Or does the fact that several
less powerful, but trusted, partners could form a
bloc to balance the perceived power of the larger
players overcome concerns about the use of
power? While we have included many of these
aspects in our model, at some point the assessment
of trustworthiness must reach some threshold, at
which time the decision is made to enter or forgo
the alliance.
We have also not delved extensively into the
nature of appropriate measures for procedural and
distributive justice. We have argued that integrity,
the adherence to a set of principles that are
perceived to be acceptable, will be a central
concern for procedural justice while abilities will
be important to the assessment of distributive
justice. Thus, previously proposed individual and
intra-organizational measures for procedural justice such as engagement (involvement in predecision consultation), explanation (of why decisions were made) and expectation clarity (understanding of ‘‘new rules of the game’’) (Kim and

<-----Page 12----->Establishing Trust during the Formation of Technology Alliances

Mauborgne, 1997, 1998) will be perceived to be
fair to the extent that they ﬁt well with the
negotiation norms accepted by the different
partner organizations. Similarly, distributive justice is likely to be perceived if the distribution of
outcomes matches the skills and competencies that
the different partners bring to the alliance and the
extent to which these reﬂect those needed for the
alliance to be deemed a success by each partner.

6. Conclusion
Trust is often accepted as a simple bipolar
attribute or fact in alliance strategy research;
either it exists or it doesn’t! Trust is certainly
acknowledged in many models of alliances and a
lack of trust is often cited as contributing to
alliance failure (Duysters et al., 1999). However,
we propose that processes surrounding the establishment of trust, the related concept of trustworthiness, and the perceptions and expectations
created in concert, warrant more detailed consideration in investigations of alliance formation.
As a ﬁrst step in this direction, we propose that
the initiation of an alliance be viewed as two
phases in which the antecedents of trustworthiness
and trust are developed and evolve. The ﬁrst
phase, that of searching for a partner, sees the
organization gathering information that will contribute to an initial assessment of the trustworthiness of that potential partner. The antecedents of
trustworthiness in this phase will be derived from a
combination of prior experience with that partner
and the reputation of the partner in a network of
trusted other organizations, when available. When
a new unknown partner is being considered, a
stance of conditional trust will initially be taken,
shaped by the available information on the
abilities and performance of the partner as well
as the likely costs, risks and beneﬁts of the alliance.
We argue that, armed with this initial assessment,
the organization will then decide to enter (or not)
the negotiation phase.
In this second phase, we propose that the initial
assessment of trustworthiness, and the likely
development of the alliance trust discussed by
other authors, will be moderated by the negotiation experience. In particular, we suggest that the
interpersonal concepts of procedural and distribu-

199

tive justice have much to offer the interorganizational domain of alliance trust formation. Our
translation of the justice literature to alliance
formation indicates that the experience of procedural justice during the negotiation phase will
create expectations that procedural and distributive justice will occur during the alliance, and
hence inﬂuence the assessment of whether or not
the potential partner is trustworthy. We also
indicate that procedural justice, and therefore
trustworthiness, perceptions will be heavily inﬂuenced by the use (or abuse) of a powerful position
during the negotiations.
While we have concentrated on the establishment of trust during the initiation of an alliance,
it is likely that consideration of interpersonal
and interorganizational distributive and procedural justice concepts would also be useful in
explaining behavior and attitudes during and
after an alliance. The partners are likely to alter
their expectations and moderate their perceptions of trustworthy behavior as the alliance
progresses. Alliance demise, for example, may
represent another decision threshold, at which
point the organization deems that an acceptable
level of justice is no longer occurring and a
point of untrustworthiness has been reached
such that the costs of exit are less than the
perceived costs of continuing to contribute to
the unfair alliance. While it was beyond the
scope of this paper, research into the role of
organizational justice concepts in alliance failure
would therefore also be worthy of further
research.
Furthermore, organizational justice concepts
are also likely to affect variables associated with
alliance performance and evolution. For example,
Alexander and Ruderman (1987) observed that
procedural fairness was a more important inﬂuence on socially mediated attitudes and behaviors
(trust in management, job satisfaction etc.)
whereas distributive fairness inﬂuenced attitudes
and behaviors that were more individual in nature
(intention to turnover). It could, therefore, be
hypothesized that procedural justice will inﬂuence
conﬂict, commitment and satisfaction measures of
an alliance, whereas distributive justice may have a
greater inﬂuence on a partner’s decision to stay or
leave an alliance. Kumar and Nti (1998) propose a
similar division in their process and outcome

<-----Page 13----->200

Daellenbach and Davenport

discrepancy model, when they argue that outcome
discrepancies, which we equate to distributive
justice, inﬂuence the ability of the partners to
achieve their (individual) economic and learning
objectives, whereas process discrepancies, which
we equate to procedural justice, relate to the
partner’s (socially mediated) satisfaction with the
pattern of interaction and feelings of psychological
attachment to the relationship.
Many of the documented studies on the
attributes of successful alliances propose similar
dependent variables. Mohr and Spekman (1994),
for example, propose a partnership success framework of three factors; attributes of the partnership
(commitment, coordination, interdependence,
trust), communication behavior (quality, information sharing, participation) and conﬂict resolution
techniques (joint problem solving, persuasion,
smoothing, domination, harsh words and arbitration). Similarly, Doz (1996) proposes learning
conditions for alliance evolution of task deﬁnition,
partners’ routines, interface structure and expectations of performance, behavior and motives. Ring
and van de Ven (1994) propose a process framework for the development of cooperative interorganizational
relationships
consisting
of
negotiation, commitment, assessment and execution stages.
The variables of these, and other frameworks
(e.g. Larson, 1992; Larsson et al., 1998; Saxton,
1997), are all slightly different either in title or
deﬁnition, but the greater majority share certain
similarities with the variables associated with
organizational justice concepts. It would, therefore, be useful to have an overarching framework
for studying and categorizing these behavioral
attributes of knowledge sharing alliances. It is our
proposal that an interorganizational version of
distributive and procedural justice may well serve
that purpose.
Overall, we see this proposal as a contribution
towards research into the processes through which
alliances form, with useful managerial implications
for forming alliances, and one that also holds
potential for considering the evolving relationships
between founding characteristics and subsequent
performance.
