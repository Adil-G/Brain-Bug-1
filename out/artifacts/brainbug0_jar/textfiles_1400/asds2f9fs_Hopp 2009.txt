Abstract Using a sample of 2,373 unique capital
contributions from 437 venture capitalists (VCs) over
subsequent rounds into 961 start-ups during the
period 1995–2005 in Germany we disentangle the
circumstances under which lead VCs engage in
syndicate relationships with partner VCs. The results
indicate that syndication is more pronounced when
VCs face higher risks that need to be diversified and
capital burdens are larger. Moreover, we document
that industry investment experience lends legitimacy
to lead VCs, allowing them to enter syndicate
relationships to enhance their network positions. In
general, greater industry experience is associated
with more syndication. Lastly, the results show that
lead VCs involve new/additional partners in subsequent financing rounds to leverage their idiosyncratic
skills and knowledge to improve deal selection and/or
provide a better quality of managerial advice.

1 Introduction
Venture capitalists (VCs) provide the required funds
and expertise to high-potential-growth companies and
strive for substantial capital gains in the medium or
sometimes long term, compensating them for the high
risk and uncertainty associated with the investment(s)
made (Sahlman 1990). VCs derive benefits from being
able to offer technological, financial, and managerial
expertise to the funded entrepreneur in order to better
screen business proposals and offer a higher quality of
advice. In venture capital (VC) financing the involvement of a partner VC is a common means to access new
financial and managerial resources. Teaming up with a
partner is referred to as syndication. Funded firms are
thus backed by more than a single VC. In moreuncertain environments (with higher asset specificity
and correspondingly greater dependence on entrepreneurial effort) VCs are more likely to encounter
unforeseen contingencies and would benefit more
from involving partner VCs and their corresponding
managerial expertise and financial endowments to
either improve selection of funded firms (Lerner 1994)
or diminish individual capital contributions, thereby
allowing participating VCs to invest smaller amounts
of capital into a larger number of funded firms to
diversify risks (Lockett and Wright 1999; Manigart
et al. 2006). The benefit of involving co-investors is
hence based on additional managerial and/or financial
resources that partner VCs can bring into the
relationship.

Using a sample of 2,373 unique capital contributions by 437 into 961 ventures we analyze the driving
forces of VC syndication and disentangle the circumstances under which VCs engage in collaboration with
partners. We start by analyzing the conditions under
which VCs tend to invest jointly with partner VCs by
focusing on the characteristics of the venture and the
involved VCs alike. The results indicate that the
likelihood for a lead VC to invest jointly with a partner
is more pronounced when the underlying venture is
younger. For firms where products are far from
commercialization the risks that investors face are
more severe and scrutiny in deal selection through
syndication and subsequent managerial advice can be
an important mechanism to align managerial effort
with the goals of the financing VCs (Lerner 1994).
Hence, VCs benefit from combining their investment
expertise when risks are more pronounced. The larger
amount of capital provided per financing rounds
impacts the likelihood of syndication positively presenting transaction-based evidence for the
questionnaire results of Manigart et al. (2006) that
VCs tend to syndicate to mitigate risks and diversify
funds. More risks and (potentially) higher capital
requirements positively affect the incentives of VCs to
involve partners.
With respect to the inherent VC characteristics, we
find that VCs with more experience in the transaction
relevant industry tend to rely more on syndication.
Enhancing one’s network position can be a vital
strategy to improve deal flow and access to new
knowledge (Hochberg et al. 2006, 2007). Hence, VCs
that are more open to syndication enjoy more
favorable network positions that enable them to
benefit from high-quality relationships. As such, the
syndication of VC investments affects the main
drivers of performance: sourcing high-quality deals
and promoting growth for the funded firms (Verwal
et al. 2008). Given the underlying uncertainty associated with asymmetric information in partner
selection, industry expertise can serve as a positive
signal and lend legitimacy to lead VCs.
Moreover, we analyze the partner selection in VC
syndicates in subsequent financing rounds. We document that a lack of industry experience drives the
involvement of new partners as a source of expertise
and knowledge. Consequently, our results show that
new partners joining an incumbent syndicate (for a
given venture) can be an important source of

123

C. Hopp

knowledge that can help to broaden the scope of
investing through an increased likelihood of obtaining new information. New partners in a syndicate can
provide different knowledge and information, despite
the uncertainty associated with selecting a new
partner.
Our results therefore stress the importance of
resource-based motives to understand the syndication
of VC investments. In fact, better resources allow
VCs to provide better advice and/or better screen
business proposals of entrepreneurs (Lerner 1994;
Brander et al. 2002). Consequently, we offer insights
into VC syndication as a quest for resources (technological, financial, managerial expertise, and
networking resources) and capabilities (the ability
to better screen business proposals and offer a higher
quality of advice to the funded entrepreneur) to close
competency gaps between the existing repository of
skills and knowledge and the potentially valuemaximizing configuration. In line with the arguments
made in Casamatta and Haritchabalet (2007) we
document that risk mitigation might bear some
relevance; it is however not the only determinant of
syndication and cannot explain widely observed
patterns of syndication and especially partner
selection.
The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical background and develops the hypotheses. Section 3
describes the dataset and the sample characteristics.
Section 4 discusses the empirical findings and
potential limitations. Section 5 concludes.

2 Theoretical background and hypotheses
2.1 Transaction characteristics
and VC syndication
VCs play a crucial role in providing growth capital to
young and innovative entrepreneurial firms. Besides
providing capital to cash-constrained entrepreneurs,
they offer additional help through managerial expertise to their funded firms. In order to mitigate the
tradeoff between specialization and diversification
the syndication of investments is a common means to
expand the investment portfolio along several dimensions. For VCs syndication can help to expand the
portfolio radius without stretching effort over too

<-----Page 2----->When do venture capitalists collaborate?

many new projects.1 In this way, effort can be
devoted to firms where the corresponding VC acts as
sole or lead investor and money can also be invested
where a partner VC spends more time and effort in
advising the funded firm.
Manigart et al. (2006) suggest that in a European
context VCs are focusing on diversification and
access to additional financing to build their portfolio(s). So instead of the risk being taken on by a
single VC it would be necessary to spread the risk
associated with an investment among a group of VCs,
thus allowing VCs to spread risk over a multitude of
firms (and industries) in order to achieve diversification benefits. Likewise each single VC involved can
invest lower amounts of capital by inviting partners
to share the capital burden.
Moreover, the combined effort of multiple VCs to
assess the quality of a venture helps them to
overcome informational asymmetries as entrepreneurs typically know more about the investment
opportunity they seek funding for and might overstate
the attractiveness of their business proposal (Sorenson and Stuart 2001). Sah and Stiglitz (1986)
conclude that the decision-making process is more
efficient and leads to better results if a project is only
financed when approved by two or more parties.
Alternatively, syndicating with a more specialized
partner can help to leverage his capabilities and
competencies to offer a better quality of managerial
advice to portfolio firms (Brander et al. 2002). The
need for such additional partner skills is anticipated
to be greater in earlier stages of an investment than in
later-stage investments. This is mainly due to the fact
that more-mature firms have an established management structure and market position and have already
built relationships with suppliers and customers
(Bygrave and Timmons 1992; Bygrave 1987; Lockett
and Wright 1999, 2001; Brander et al. 2002).
This suggests that greater risk associated with the
underlying transaction should be linked to greater
syndication in order either to reduce individual capital
contributions (to spread the capital that a VC manages
1

Syndication in its widest definition means that more than a
single VC has injected capital, regardless of the rounds. Hence,
simultaneous investments are no prerequisite for the notion of
syndication. Fluck et al. (2005) and Brander et al. (2002) also
use this definition of syndication, whereas Manigart et al.
(2006) refer to syndication only when investments are made
simultaneously.

419

over a larger number of funded firms and achieve
diversification benefits) or to involve partners to
mitigate risk through complementary expertise via
improved selection of transactions or provision of
better quality of advice. Based on these considerations
we formulate the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1 A higher risk associated with the
underlying transaction increases the benefits from
involving partner VCs and leads to more syndication.
2.2 Industry experience and VC syndication
As current and desired competencies form the basis
of value creation, strategic actions of VCs are
characterized by new opportunities and the corresponding competencies to master them. Related work
on resource dependency argues that VCs are likely to
lack (at least to some extent) potential resources
(technological or investment expertise) that are
needed to achieve long-term competitive advantages.
While proprietary VC resources are key to acquiring
and sustaining competitive advantages, the lack
thereof leads to alternative routes of generating and
accessing knowledge to prosper (Pfeffer and Salancik
1978; Barney 1991). Brander et al. (2002) put
forward the notion that syndication permits VCs to
combine complementary knowledge. Each participating VC endows a set of resources that is combined
with the partner’s resources with the expectation of
generating superior advice for the entrepreneur and/or
better screening of the proposed transaction (Lerner
1994; Sorensen 2007). Given that it might be difficult
for each VC to actually learn what the partner knows,
syndicates provide a mode of combining specialized
knowledge. In this way, VCs can gain access to
valuable resources of partners that might aid in the
management of financed transactions (Harrison et al.
2001; McEvily and Marcus 2005).
Investment experience within a transaction-relevant industry yields valuable insights into structuring
deals and advising the funded entrepreneur and
henceforth lies at the heart of understanding how
VCs can create value. Those VCs that possess
transaction-relevant investment experience do not
need to rely on partners to offer a better quality of
managerial advice to their funded ventures or to
improve deal selection and subsequent continuation/
abandonment decisions (Verwal et al. 2008). Overall,

123

<-----Page 3----->420

the investment experience within the underlying
industry of a prospective transaction should be
negatively related to the VCs’ propensity to syndicate.
Accordingly, we formulate the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2a Industry experience mitigates the
risks VCs face in a transaction and reduces the
likelihood of syndication.
Verwal et al. (2008) distinguish between the
necessity and capability to enter into syndicate
relationships with partner VCs. While smaller/inexperienced VCs would benefit more from syndication,
they may lack the legitimacy to enter such partnerships. More reputable VCs, however, are more
reasonable partners due to their status, network
resources, and scope of operations.
Hochberg et al. (2007) analyze the performance
consequences of syndicate relationships formed in the
US venture capital industry and show that funded
firms whose investors enjoy a more influential
position within the VC network perform substantially
better (as measured by the number of IPO or trade-sale
exits to the number of total investments). Given the
high returns for well-networked VCs, Hochberg et al.
(2007) suggest enhancing one’s network position as a
vital strategic consideration for a VC. Being able to
syndicate with a larger number of partners improves
the position of a VC substantially, raising the
probability of being invited to join other profitable
deals in the future. While smaller VCs would benefit
most from accessing additional expertise they would
be less likely to be able to reciprocate in the future due
to the limited deal flow. Hence, they will find it more
difficult to find appropriate ventures and actually act
as lead VCs inviting partners. Accordingly, the
capability to reciprocate in the future is more valuable
for reputable VCs with a greater number of transactions and network partners (Verwal et al. 2008).
Syndication should therefore be more pronounced
among more experienced VCs that can manage their
network resources and have an existing universe of
partners from which to select appropriate ties to
better manage a given transaction or reciprocate
existing deeds. Hence, VCs that are more open to
syndication enjoy more favourable network positions
that enable them to benefit from high-quality relationships. As such, the syndication of VC investments
affects the main drivers of performance: sourcing
high-quality deals and promoting growth for the

123

C. Hopp

funded firms through combined expertise. Moreover,
networking among incumbent VCs can help to deter
entry. Denser networks see substantially less entry
(Hochberg et al. 2007). Industry experience can
therefore signal competencies and potential future
value creation within a combined working
relationship to potential partner VCs. Accordingly,
possessing industry experience acts as a prerequisite
for being able to invite other VCs to participate in a
given transaction. Thus, we formulate the alternative
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2b Industry experience lends legitimacy to lead VCs and increases the likelihood of
syndication.
2.3 Partner selection in subsequent rounds
Over time VCs have to bridge the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency through recursive actions
and the necessity to monitor and check capabilities to
allow for timely actions to absorb environmental
changes (Gompers and Lerner 2002). Through collaboration with new/additional partners in subsequent
financing rounds lead VCs can avoid becoming stuck
in competency traps. In this vein, new partnerships
can provide new and different information than
existing ties could, despite the uncertainty associated
with the selection of a new partner. New partners in a
VC syndicate can be an important source of knowledge that can help to broaden the underlying
investment experience to improve continuation/abandonment decisions in future rounds or provide a
higher quality of managerial advice. Teaming up with
additional new partners can therefore be beneficial
for already involved VCs through an increased
likelihood of obtaining new information and increasing the diversity of information to which a lead VC is
exposed (Dimov and De Clercq 2008).
Rothaermel (2001), however, finds a general
tendency towards exploitation of complementary
assets in alliances. Accordingly, firms tend to
leverage experience from previous successful relationships and engage in recurrent alliances. Based on
past successful implementation firms can judge the
efficiency of established routines and might be
tempted to reinforce given prior favorable outcomes.
Thus, with an increase in transaction-relevant industry experiences, the value added stemming from

<-----Page 4----->When do venture capitalists collaborate?

exploring knowledge with new partners is diluted and
lead VCs should turn towards exploitive strategies to
leverage existing routines with previous partners
rather than working with new partners.
We therefore argue that, if the existing repository of
investment experience of the initial participating VC
(or among a group of VCs that participated in previous
rounds) is not sufficient to provide an edge, syndicating the investment in a subsequent financing round
with a new partner VC can be a viable strategy to
ensure future value creation. Hence, a lead VC might
be tempted to syndicate his transaction in a future
round by inviting an additional VC and expand the
scope of the syndicate if he has not been able to acquire
additional industry investment experience during the
course of successive financing rounds. A lack of
industry experience might therefore foster the necessity to rely on partner experience in subsequent rounds.
Hence, we formulate the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3 A lack of industry experience of the
incumbent financing VCs increases the likelihood of
syndication with new/additional partner VCs in
subsequent financing rounds.

3 Investment sample
3.1 Data collection and descriptive statistics
The sample consists of 2,373 venture capital transactions in Germany within the period 1995–2005.
The number of total financing events comprises
capital injections of 437 VCs that are subsequently
made over different stages (start-up, early stage, and
late stage) into 961 firms.2 The transactions were
compiled by using the Thomson Venture Economics
(TVE) database. We identified the involved parties in
each transaction and the corresponding information
on the VCs along with the funded firms. The result is
a deal survey exhibiting who funded a new company
and was joined by which partner. Moreover, we
collected information about each financing round. As
such, we identify which VC made an investment into
2

On average a funded firm has been provided with financing
2.2 times during the investigation period. This implies that
either a firm has received financing 2.2 times from the same
VC (in successive rounds) or by 2.2 VCs on average (in either
successive rounds or in the same round).

421

a target firm at which point in time. In addition we
supplemented the database with information regarding the VCs and the funded firms, along with
information specific on the actual deal. The analysis
is made on the basis of investment rounds as
indicated through TVE. A distinction between milestone and round financing cannot be observed.3
3.2 Dependent variable
As the dependent variable for the first two hypotheses
we use the dichotomous decision of whether to
syndicate (involve a partner VC) within a specific
round, as indicated by TVE. Here, we analyze the
narrow choice of syndication when two or more VCs
invest simultaneously. When the investment was
made by two or more distinct VCs the variable takes
on the value of one, and is zero when only a single
VC is involved. We will analyze the decision from
the lead VC perspective. Hence, the results allow for
inferences into the circumstances under which a lead
VC is willing to join forces with partners.
Concerning hypothesis 3, we analyze what determines the involvement of a new/additional VC in
subsequent financing rounds, once the initial investment was made. Here, we use a wider definition of
syndication (as in Brander et al. 2002 and Fluck et al.
2005) that accounts for differences among multiple
VCs injecting capital in successive rounds. Hence,
simultaneous investments are no prerequisite for the
notion of syndication in this analysis. This analysis
yield insights into the selection of partners in future
round and helps to gain a better understanding of the
driving patterns of syndication over time (e.g.,
syndicating down an investment with new partners).
Accordingly, the dependent variable will take on a
value of one when a new/additional VC (that has not
been involved in any previous round) is providing
capital in a given round and zero otherwise.
The role in managing (and monitoring) the underlying investment differs substantially between lead
and nonlead investors. Gorman and Sahlman (1989)
find that the lead investor spends about ten times

3

The sample resembles the aggregate statistics published by
the German Venture Capital and Private Equity Association
and comparable representative studies in terms of industries
and stages studied (see, among others, BVK 2005; Mayer et al.
2005; Bascha and Walz 2007).

123

<-----Page 5----->422

more effort (time) on monitoring and managing the
investment. We have included a measure of a leading
role of VCs for each transaction. Hochberg et al.
(2007) define the lead investor as the investor who
acquires the largest stake in a portfolio company.
Megginson and Weiss (1991) and Sorensen (2007)
use a similar argument. As TVE only reports the total
amount invested per round and does not distinguish
between the sum invested by each VC involved on a
stand-alone basis, we proxy for the lead investor(s)
using two criteria that have to be fulfilled simultaneously: the maximum number of rounds and the
involvement in the initial financing round. The lead
investor is defined as the VC that has participated in
the maximum number of rounds among all investing
VCs and was also involved in the first round of
financing. This approach is identical to that adopted
in Hopp (2008). Underlying this assumption is the
same argument as in Megginson and Weiss (1991) or
Sorensen (2007) that the lead investor usually has the
largest amount of money at stake and therefore an
incentive to take a more active role in managing the
syndicate and advising the portfolio company. A lead
VC is therefore the VC that has participated in the
highest number of financing rounds among all
involved VCs. There can be multiple VCs or even
no lead VC at all (in which case the venture drops
from the analysis). Accordingly, the lead VC is
assumed to invite partner VCs to take part in a
specific transaction. For all transactions with a single
VC involved the lead investor naturally is equal to the
only participating VC. The study for hypothesis 1
and 2 thus analyzes syndication from the side of the
leading VC. For hypothesis 3 information on all
previously involved VCs enter the analysis.
3.3 Independent variables
Given that we can track the investment experience
that VCs accumulated over time and in specific
industries we can infer how the existing resource
configuration (and the potential erosion) impacts the
decision of which partners to team up with and
whether resource gaps warrant network expansions to
generate reconfigurations. The VC attributes are
based on the cumulative cooperation behavior until
the end of the year prior to the given year. The
resulting structure is a cross-section of transactions
over time, with varying covariates over the years. All

123

C. Hopp

measures are either calculated as the cumulative
number until the end of the year prior to the given
year (in which the deal takes place) or by just using
the relevant information from events happening in the
year prior to the given year (t - 1 analysis). In this
way, issues of causality between the dependent and
independent variables are circumvented; for example,
the total number of transactions that a VC has made
in (or until the end of the year) 2004 is used to
explain his syndication decisions in 2005. Hence,
syndication decisions in 2005 cannot influence the
independent variables in 2004. We will measure
experience and contacts on the basis of the VC firm
level rather than for specific funds (of the same VC
firm) separately. Underlying this assumption is the
argumentation that ties and experience acquired carry
over to a VC’s next fund (Hochberg et al. 2007). The
following explanatory variables are used in the
estimation procedure:
3.3.1 Industry experience (in the previous year)
To measure the effect of industry experience on
syndication behavior, we calculated the total experience that the corresponding VC(s) acquired during
the course of the previous year in the given industry
in which a deal takes place. We used information
from TVE to identify the industry of a particular
venture and make use of the Venture Economics
Industry Classification (VEIC)—a Venture Economics
proprietary industry classification scheme. In order to
draw more distinct conclusions we further split the
industries in the sample, which results in finer
industry clusters. Namely, we divided the medical/
health classification into two separate categories.
Moreover, we split the industrial sector into industrial
products (such as chemicals and industrial equipment) and industrial services (such as transportation,
logistics, and manufacturing services). We created a
category for Internet firms to cope with the particularities of investments into ‘‘new economy’’ firms
over the period.4 Accordingly, industry experience
measures the previous number of transactions that the
corresponding VC carried out throughout the
4

Groupings have been made based on VEIC level 1 codes.
Firms that were solely focusing on the Internet to sell and
market products were included in the separate Internet/
e-commerce category.

<-----Page 6----->When do venture capitalists collaborate?

423

previous year. We do not include further industry
dummies as these would be highly correlated with the
experience of VCs in overrepresented industries, such
as biotechnology and software. For the analysis of
syndication patterns, industry experience within the
previous year allows for more variation in the
independent variables and circumvents problems of
autocorrelation. Even for larger VCs we see more
variation from year to year and hence can get more
insights into the changing syndication patterns by
using a rolling measure of industry experience.
Especially for hypothesis 3, this measure is more
appropriate to test the impact of generation and
dilution of expertise over time and the necessity to
syndicate in subsequent financing rounds.
3.3.2 Increase in industry experience
Concerning hypothesis 3 we also account for a
possible change in the level of industry experience
among the VCs involved in a previous round. We
only measure the additional industry experience that
the incumbent VCs have gained between the last time
financing was provided and the given round. Hence,
we would expect that, if incumbent VCs have only
made a few transactions (or no transaction at all) in
the meantime, the likelihood that they will invite a
new VC for a subsequent round is higher. The change

in industry experience is calculated for all incumbent
VCs that participate in a subsequent round and over
the interval between the current and the preceding
round of financing.
Table 1 gives a brief overview of the industry
distribution of VC investments during the investigation period. We can infer that biotechnology and
software are the industries with the highest number of
firms financed. They rank top, with 142 and 215
funded ventures, respectively. Additionally, there are
some 100 transactions in electronics, industrial products, and Internet. Concerning the use of syndication,
biotechnology is the industry with more pronounced
syndication. Almost 61% of all firms funded (regardless of the rounds) have more than one investor.
Among the other industries, industrial products and
service exhibit a lower level of syndication, with
slightly below 20% of the firms being backed by
more than a single investor.
3.3.3 Type of current financing round (dummy)
Additionally, TVE gives information about five
different stage categories: start-up/seed, early stage,
expansion, later stage, and other. Similar to Gompers
(1995) who labels the categories for bridge, second,
and third stage financing as ‘‘late-stage’’ financing,
we combined the TVE categories of expansion, later
stage, and other to form a new category, which we
also label ‘‘late stage’’. As there is no clear distinction
between expansion financing that almost always
occur in later phases and other financing activities,
namely bridge financing or special-purpose financing,
from the ‘‘later-stage’’ category, this combination
appears to be the most reasonable classification
scheme.
3.3.4 Funded firm age
With respect to hypothesis 1, arguing that with a
higher risk of investing VCs should rely to a larger
extent on syndication, we gathered data about the
funded firms founding date and combined that
information with the investment date to arrive at the
age of the funded firm at the date of each capital
infusion. As pointed out by Bygrave (1987) younger
firms are more likely to fail and consequently firm
age at investment can serve as a proxy for the
riskiness of a venture.

123

<-----Page 7----->424

3.3.5 Amount of financing provided
According to Lockett and Wright (1999) the size of
an investment plays an important role in the decision
to syndicate. When VCs want to avoid clustering of
risks or when the venture under consideration is
simply too large for the corresponding VCs the
chances are higher that a deal will be carried out by a
syndicate. These elaborations are supported by the
findings of Manigart et al. (2006) that mitigation of
risk is predominantly important for VCs. In order to
test for the impact of the size of an investment we
include the total amount provided for a given round
(regardless of whether a syndicate or a single
investor provided the financing) into the empirical
analysis.
3.4 Control variables
3.4.1 Type of VC investor (dummy)
As shown by Cumming (2006) the heterogeneity of
VCs plays a significantly more important role in
providing growth capital to entrepreneurial firms in
other countries than in the USA. Given the diversity
of VC types in Germany we also control for the
various affiliations of lead VCs (see, among others,
Tykvova 2004). We classify the VC as being
independent if there are no links to other firms or
banks. Secondly, we classify VCs as bank dependent
when a private bank founded them or a private bank
holds more than 50% of the shares. Thirdly, we
classify a VC as public if the shares are hold by either
the German government or one of the German public
banking associations, i.e., Sparkassen or Landesbanken.
Additionally, we classified a VC as being a corporate
VC when there were links to a large corporation or
when a larger corporation founded the corresponding
VC. Lastly, we include a dummy for cooperative VCs
if one of the German cooperative banks holds more
than 50% of the shares.
Moreover, the German VC market is characterized
by a vast number of foreign investors playing a
significant role in providing growth capital (Achleitner
and Klöckner 2005). The data also allows meaningful
conclusions to be reached on the use of syndication to
access specialized market knowledge for VCs more
unfamiliar with the market and cultural environment

123

C. Hopp

in which they are acting by controlling for the origin
of the corresponding VCs. Hence, we control for the
origin of the various VCs using a dummy variable for
foreign VCs. An investor is recorded as foreign if he
comes from a foreign origin and did not operate from
a German branch.
3.4.2 VC investment focus (dummies)
We included three different investment focus variables for the VCs to control for experience within a
focus industry, which proxies for more specific
knowledge acquired. TVE includes three different
investment domains. The respective dummies take on
the value of one if the corresponding VC invests
mainly in high technology, medical/health, and nonhigh industries or has no stated investment focus,
respectively, and zero otherwise. A distinction using
percentages is not carried out. We do, however,
include the number of total investments into the given
industry (in which the venture is active) as an
explanatory variable into the analysis to allow for a
more fine-grained analysis.
3.4.3 (Cumulative) capital and funds managed
In order to proxy for experience acquired through the
management of capital over the past years we include
a variable indicating the cumulative capital and
specific investment funds that the corresponding lead
investor has managed until the end of the previous
year. These measures are calculated using VC fund
information from Thomson Venture Economics. Due
to the high correlation among these variables, both
will enter the regressions separately. Both variables
are used as the log.
3.4.4 Previous round syndication (dummy)
In order to rule out any dependencies between the
given and the preceding rounds, we control for the
syndication behavior of VCs during the preceding
round. We would expect that, if the preceding round
has been financed by a syndicate, the chances for a
continuing joint effort are higher. Hence, we include
a dummy into our analysis for subsequent financing
rounds, controlling whether the preceding round was
carried out by a syndicate, regardless of the size.

<-----Page 8----->When do venture capitalists collaborate?

3.4.5 Days between subsequent financing rounds
To account for the time between subsequent financing
rounds we count the number of days between when the
previous financing was provided and the current round.
This should control for a possible erosion of industry
knowledge beyond the experience gathered in the
previous year and between successive financing rounds.
3.5 Empirical methodology
The empirical part of this paper consists of two
separate analyses looking at syndication patterns
within specific investment rounds and partner selection in later rounds that are used to test the impact of
VC (and funded-firm) characteristics on the propensity to syndicate and into the decision with whom to
syndicate. First of all we fit a logistic regression with
the 1/0 decision to syndicate/invest alone. Thereby
we control for year effects using yearly dummy
variables (not tabulated) and also allow for clustering
in the error terms over the VC investors, to cope with
overrepresented VCs in the sample. Secondly, we fit
another set of logit regressions with the 1/0 variable
representing the decision to involve a new VC partner
that has not invested in the previous round.

4 Analysis and results
Table 2 presents the summary statistics for the
variables used in the empirical analysis. Concerning
the stages one can infer that around 12% of the
investments are done in the start-up stage, 25% in
early-stage firms, and that the main bulk of the
investments were carried out in late-stage investments. Due to the larger number of syndication in
later stages (Table 3) the summary statistics might be
slightly misleading a first glance. Due to double
counting of investments (when more than a single VC
provided financing and when more than a single
round was provided) the actual number of firms
initially financed in either stage is around 25% for
both the start-up and the early stage. The remaining
50% of investments were made at later stages.
Apparently, all ventures that run through subsequent
stages are accounted for in the summary statistics as
often as they receive financing (depending on the
number of rounds and VCs involved).

425

With respect to the origin of the VCs one can infer
that around 23% of the capital contributions stem
from a VC with a foreign headquarter. Moreover,
independent VCs account for the main body of the
transactions and were involved in more than 60% of
the individual capital contributions. The remainder is
split among banking-dependent VCs (with 15%) and
public VCs (with 13%). Cooperative and corporate
VCs account for only 1% and 7%, respectively.
Additionally, the main body of VCs has no specific
investment focus (around 50%) whereas the other
VCs concentrate on information-technology ventures
(37%) and medical and health products (around
12%). Due to the low number of data points for some
of dummy variables (namely cooperative and corporate VCs as well as VCs focusing on non-hightechnology firms, these dummies had to be dropped
from part of the empirical part when additional
covariates were added). Noticeably, VCs managed on
average five funds and had an average capital
invested of some 40 million Euros and provided
some 1.8 million Euros in a specific round on
average. Again, these numbers are in the aggregate
skewed towards overrepresented, larger VCs in the
dataset. In fact, standard errors in the following
empirical part were adjusted for clustering on the
lead VC level to avoid a bias from overrepresented
VCs.
With respect to hypothesis 1, arguing that a higher
risk associated with the investment influences the
decision to syndicate positively, we find in specifications two to five (Table 3) that the age of the
funded firm has a significant negative effect (at the
1% and 10% level, respectively) on propensity to
syndicate. Younger and more risky companies call
for a higher level of syndication. Accordingly, when
the investment is provided to an older firm, less
partner involvement is required and lead VCs syndicate to a lesser extent. Moreover, we can see that the
amount provided in a given round is positively
associated with the likelihood of syndication (at the
1% level). The more capital that is provided, the more
the lead VC will invite partners to share the capital
burden. The required investment amount can have a
negative effect on the size of the overall portfolio and
larger companies require VCs to take a much higher
exposure when acquiring a sizeable equity stake,
leading to a higher incentive to syndicate due to the
intensified need to spread financial risks.

The table reports a logit model estimating the likelihood of lead VCs to involve partners during a specific round of investment. The
table reports the coefficient estimate in the first line along with robust standard errors in the line below for each variable. Intercepts
are not shown. Year dummies have been included in all regressions but are not tabulated. The year dummies 2004 and 2005 are
positive and significantly different from the omitted 2000 year dummy in all regression specifications. The capital and funds managed
enter the regression as the log. The variables ‘‘corporate’’ and ‘‘no focus’’ have been dropped to avoid perfect collinearity. Standard
errors are adjusted for clustering on the VC level. Missing values for coefficients indicate that the corresponding variables have been
omitted from the regression due to the low number of data points available
*, **, *** denotes significance at the 10%, 5% or 1% level, respectively

With respect to the industry experience of the lead
VCs, the results show support for hypothesis 2b,
indicating that VCs with more industry experience

syndicate to a larger extent. The coefficient associated with industry experience that lead VCs have
gained during the course of the preceding year is

123

<-----Page 11----->428

positive and significant in all five regressions (significance levels vary, however). Hence, industry
experience does not mitigate investment risks faced,
but rather acts as a certification argument for
potential new partners. Only those VCs that possess
industry experience can make use of syndication.
Accordingly, our findings stress the importance of
enhancing a VC’s network position as a vital strategy
to improve deal flow and access to new knowledge
(Hochberg et al. 2006, 2007). Moreover, the results
show that syndicate financing seems to be rather
stable over time. If a preceding round has been
financed through a syndicate the likelihood that a
future round will be financed by a group of VCs is
significantly higher. The coefficient associated with
the dummy variable indicating whether the previous
round has been subject to syndication is positive and
significant (at the 1% level). This indicates that in
general syndication for a given venture is not a onetime event. VCs investing in syndicates tend to build
upon their joint effort and rely on partner efforts in
future rounds.
Concerning the control variables, Table 3 reveals
that among the various VC types independent VCs
syndicate significantly less (when compared with the
omitted corporate VC dummy). The coefficient
associated with the dummy for independent VCs is
negative and significant in four out of five regression
specifications (at the 5% level the least). Moreover,
foreign VCs are also more likely to work with
partners when financing investments. The coefficient
associated with the foreign VC dummy is highly
significant in four out of five regression specifications
estimated. This indicates that due to the nonfamiliarity with the local market foreign VCs face a higher
risk when investing and hence benefit more from
involving co-investors to access new expertise.
With respect to stage of development, Table 3
indicates that more syndication occurs in the earlystage category. The coefficient associated with this
variable is positive and significant (when compared
with the omitted late-stage dummy). This indicates
that, when investments are made in earlier stages (and
investors face more risks), syndication is more
pronounced. However, for the start-up dummy this
effect cannot be confirmed with the dataset. The startup dummy is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Lockett and Wright (1999, 2001) point
out that the capital requirements for transactions are

123

C. Hopp

lower in the earliest stages of company development.
Accordingly, a lower capital burden in the start-up
stage might offset the generally more pronounced risk
and lower a VC’s incentive to syndicate. Consequently, lead VCs benefit more from inviting partners
in the early stage where ventures are still very risky but
capital burdens become more intense. Thus, individual
capital contributions could become more heavily
clustered into single risky ventures and/or industries.
Hence, the involvement of a partner VC might be a
valid means to limit individual investment exposure.
For hypothesis 3 we would expect VCs to rely on
previously established ties (partners already present in
the syndicate) when industry experience is sufficient
to make continuation/abandonment decisions and
provide a higher quality of managerial advice. Hence,
new partners should be invited in later rounds when
leads VCs (and the partners that were invited previously) do not have enough industry knowledge or
have not gained additional experience over the course
of successive financing rounds. From the results in
Table 4 we can infer that the industry experience of
incumbent VCs is negative and significant (at the 1%
level), indicating that those syndicates that possess
industry expertise are likely to reinforce their relationship and do not expand their partner radius. On the
contrary, these results imply that networks are likely
to be expanded when incumbents lack relevant
industry experience. Moreover, the increase in industry experience (measured between two subsequent
financing rounds) shows the same negative impact and
is also significant at the 1% level. Hence, new partners
are a valid alternative if the existing repository of
knowledge and information that different incumbents
can contribute to the management of the funded
venture are not sufficient to add value through better
continuation/abandonment decisions and/or a higher
quality of managerial advice.
Concerning the stage variables, we do not find any
evidence that the involvement of new partners differs
between subsequent stages of development. None of
the dummy variables is significant at conventional
levels. VC characteristics seem to be the main driving
force of partner selection patterns here, and characteristics of the underlying transaction do not
significantly impact the likelihood of inviting a new
partner to join a subsequent financing round. However, when a previous round has been subject to
syndication this significantly reduces the chances of a

new partner joining; the coefficient is negative and
highly significant. Accordingly, incumbent VCs generally aim at providing money in subsequent rounds
within the existing syndicate structure and only aim
at new partners/knowledge when the existing repository does not suffice to provide an edge, as indicated

by the industry experience variables. Moreover, the
amount provided positively influences the decision to
invite a new VC. The variable is highly significant.
Again, the higher the capital contributions become,
the more likely a concentration of capital towards
specific investments and industries becomes. For this

123

<-----Page 13----->430

reason, the incentives for incumbent VCs to share the
capital burden with new investors increase. Among
the different groups of VCs, independent VCs tend to
invite new partners to a lesser extent (when compared
with the omitted cooperative dummy variable). This
coefficient is negative and highly significant in all
regression specifications. Concerning the focus variables, none of the coefficients is significant at
conventional levels. None of the VCs focusing on
certain industries seems to differ in their partner
selection behavior. Lastly, the coefficient associated
with the age variable is negative and significant in
three out five regressions, but becomes insignificant
when we control for other variables measuring the
development of the firm. Hence, there is weak
evidence that lower firm risk (as measured by the
age variable) negatively affects the need to invite new
partners.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we shed light on the syndication behavior
of VCs in Germany. Using a sample of 2,373 unique
capital contributions from 437 VCs over subsequent
rounds into 961 start-ups during the period 1995–2005
in Germany we hypothesize investment behavior and
test the potential consequences against the actual
empirical outcome of the data set. We provide
evidence that, for funded firms where products are
far from commercialization, the risks that investors
face are more severe and scrutiny in deal selection
through syndication and subsequent managerial
advice can be an important mechanism to align
managerial effort with the goals of the financing VCs.
Hence, VCs benefit from combining their investment
expertise when risks are more pronounced.
We believe that situating the necessity to engage in
interfirm relationships and the partnering choices of
VCs in the dynamic environmental context by
focusing on partnering decisions over time and
rounds yields a better understanding of the importance of industry knowledge for the involvement of
partners and especially for expansion of syndication
networks to new partners. Industry experience in
general is associated with more syndication. While
we cannot distinguish between deal-flow reciprocation and management resources directly, the proxies
illustrate the overall tendency of more experienced

123

C. Hopp

VCs to enter to a larger extent into syndicate
relationships. This provides evidence for networking
motives and the legitimacy of more experienced VCs
with respect to syndicate formation. More experienced lead VCs can capitalize on their previously
acquired expertise and further expand their network
through syndication. In line with the results of
Hochberg et al. (2006, 2007) we find that syndication
appears to be a vital strategy to enhance one’s
network position.
Moreover, we find that syndication in subsequent
rounds serves as a means to combine industry
experience to better select ventures and/or offer a
higher quality of managerial advice. Hence, one can
see that VCs tend to team up with new partners if the
current network might not provide the necessary
repository of skills and investment knowledge that
might be needed to successfully finance and guide
new ventures. By tracking the VC networks over time
and industries, we open up the black box of network
expansion strategies and show how a quest for partner
resources can explain the dynamic patterns in VC
collaboration by paying attention to the combination,
generation, and dilution of investment experience.
Syndication networks will only be broadened if
potential new partners can offer additional value
beyond the current composition of incumbent syndicate members.
Our results provide initial evidence that different
forms of relationships matter for venture financing.
Nevertheless, we need to gain further insights into the
formation and closure of networks within the VC
industry in order to gauge new perspectives on how
and why firms syndicate. It might be interesting to
investigate further with whom VCs syndicate and in
which sense later-stage syndication involves more
reputable partners in order to cushion potential
transaction costs owed to more intense monitoring
among the parties. The timing of partner involvement
in certain stages and the reputation and the rank
within the VC network could therefore yield more
valuable insights into the mechanics of VC syndication. Additionally, the role of building up network
ties and the impact of reciprocity and expected deal
flow would present an interesting avenue for future
research.
As the decision of whom to invite to participate in
VC transactions lies at the heart of understanding
why syndication might add value to the funded firm it

might be worthwhile to investigate further which
partners VCs tend to team up with and under which
circumstances these relationships are established.
