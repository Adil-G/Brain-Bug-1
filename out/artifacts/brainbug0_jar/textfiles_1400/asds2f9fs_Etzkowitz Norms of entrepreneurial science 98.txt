Abstract
Universities are currently undergoing a ‘second revolution’ these days, incorporating economic and social development
as part of their mission. The first academic revolution made research an academic function in addition to teaching. Now the
emerging entrepreneurial university integrates economic development as an additional function. The ‘capitalisation of
knowledge’ takes many different forms that are discussed in this article. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Entrepreneurial activities of scientists are by no
means totally new phenomena. Such things occurred
in 17th century German pharmaceutical science. Another famous example is Justus Liebig’s fertiliser
venture in the mid 19th century ŽEtzkowitz, 1983..
However, these and other chemical spin-offs did not
affect academic research sites. The formation of
industrial consulting and scientific instrumentation
firms by scientists also took place in the late nineteenth century at Harvard and MIT but were anomalies at the time ŽShimshoni, 1970.. During the past
two decades, however, an increasing number of academic scientists have taken some or all of the steps
necessary to start a firm by writing business plans,
raising funds, leasing space, recruiting staff, etc.

these matters likely underestimate the extent of faculty involvement, especially in molecular biology.
For example, although a survey identified half the
faculty of the MIT biology department as having
industrial ties in the late 1980s, an informant could
identify only one of his colleagues as uninvolved.
Although still only a minute proportion of the total
US academic enterprise is directly involved, faculty
inventing and commercialisation has had significant
cognitive and organisational consequences.
A complex web of relationships has grown up
among academics, university originated start-ups and
larger firms. Often the same academic scientists are
involved in both types of companies, managing a
diversified portfolio of industrial interactions ŽPowell
et al., 1996.. Indeed, some early critics of such
activities have become entrepreneurial scientists
themselves. Nobelist Joshua Lederberg found the
scientific issues and financial rewards too intriguing
not to get involved. Another Nobelist, Arthur Kornberg, expressed bemused bewilderment in his autobiography ‘The Golden Helix’ that a highly focused
academic scientist such as himself had become an

advocate of industryracademic intersection, finding
it fruitful for both science and business. 1
Remarkably, even those who leave academia retain ties. Having been turned down for tenure by
Columbia University’s Computer Science Department in the mid 1980s, David Shaw applied his
computing skills to financial analysis and drew upon
former colleagues and students for his firm’s original
talent pool. The D.E. Shaw & Co., a global investment bank, currently advertises to recruit, ‘‘unusually talented and accomplished individuals with degrees in any area of the sciences or humanities . . . to
a career they may never have considered before . . . ’’
ŽAdvertisement in Political Science Quarterly, 1997..
In the face of a tight academic job market, opportunities have opened up in firms based upon academic
knowledge.
Until quite recently the commercialisation of academic research typically took place at a distance, by
former students with or without the knowledge of
their mentor. A striking comparison illustrating the
change in this respect are sociologist Robert K.
Merton and economist Robert C. Merton, father and
son. In the early 1990s the New York chapter of the
Public Opinion Research Association held a special
meeting honouring Prof. Robert K. Merton, who was
astonished to learn that a multimillion advertising
and political industry had grown out of ‘focus
groups,’ an interviewing technique that he had developed in the course of a 1940s study of interracial
housing. In contrast, press reports of Prof. Robert C.
Merton’s 1997 Nobel Prize in economics, for a
method to judge risks in options pricing, noted that
he was a principal in a Greenwich Connecticut firm
using these techniques in its business. The quite
different stances of the Mertons to the pecuniary
outcomes of their research exemplifies the generational change in attitude among academic scientists
toward involvement in commercialisation.
This article analyses the cognitive effects of the
new universityrindustry linkages on the way scientists view research, interpret the scientific role, and
interact with colleagues, companies and universities.
The growth of a commercial ethos within academia,

and the emergence of conflict lines over this development, culminates in normative change in science.
Traditionally, the most deeply held value of scientists is the extension of knowledge. To contribute to
this is the highest striving of a scientist. The incorporation of ‘extension of knowledge’ into a compatible
relationship with ‘capitalisation of knowledge’ is a
profound normative change in science. It will be
shown that the transition to entrepreneurial science is
occurring as an interplay of cognitive opportunities,
institutional rearrangements, and normative change,
and that this in turn has cognitive effects on future
research agendas. Certain cognitive changes in a
growing number of disciplines and scientific fields
open up possibilities to scientists to meet two goals
simultaneously: the pursuit of truth and profit-making. Accordingly, the norms of science which traditionally condemn profit-making motives are beginning to change to allow for such a kind of entrepreneurship; and varying institutional structures
are experimented with which fit to these new cognitive and normative patterns ŽMerton, 1973 w1942x;
Etzkowitz, 1994..

2. Method and data
The article draws for data on more than 150
in-depth interviews conducted in several waves from
the early 1980s. An initial study focused upon four
disciplines Žbiology, computer science, electrical engineering, and physics. at two research universities.
This was followed up, in the mid 1980s, by a
study of five disciplines Žadding chemistry. at eight
universities, including those with long standing and
newly emerging industrial ties, with some geographical spread around the US. The study was replicated
in the early 1990s. This paper primarily reports on
longitudinal case studies of two public universities
newly involved with industry: the University of Colorado, Boulder and the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.

3. The transition from old to new forms of linkage
1

Others, such as Jonathan King of MIT and Norton Zinder of
Rockefeller University, remain steadfast in their opposition.

From an industrial perspective, relations with universities have traditionally been viewed primarily as

<-----Page 2----->H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

a source of human capital, future employees and,
secondarily, as a source of knowledge useful to the
firm. In this view what industry wants and needs
from academic researchers is basic research knowledge; therefore, universities should focus on their
traditional missions of research and education, their
unique function. The hydraulic assumptions of
knowledge flows include reservoirs, dams and gateways that facilitate and regulate the transmission of
information between institutional spheres with distinctly different functions Že.g., academia: basic research; companies: product development.. Thus, the
academic and industrial spheres should each concentrate on their traditional functions and interact across
distinct, strongly defended, boundaries.
This classic industrial perspective of academia is
expressed in Europe by the industrial group ŽIRDAC.
in the Research Directorate of the European Union
and by the Industry–University–Government
Roundtable in the U.S. These organisations primarily
represent large multinational firms, whether of U.S.
or European origin. Such firms represent the first
sector in a typology of firm perspectives on relations
with industry. Although this is changing, in such
companies R & D was traditionally internalised within
the firm, with a window on academic research obtained through consultation and participation in liaison programs. In a second group of companies,
typically smaller and based on low and mid-level
technologies, with little or no R & D capacity, relations with academia, if any, will also be informal
through engaging an academic consultant to test
materials or trouble shoot a specific problem. More
intensive relationships occur with a third group of
firms that have grown out of university research and
are still closely connected to their original source.
More recently, given the rapid pace of innovation in
their industrial sector, some older firms have externalised some of their R & D and seek to import
technologies or engage in joint R & D programs to
develop them, thus creating a fourth group of firms
that are becoming closer in their cognitive orientation to academic start-ups.
In these latter instances, traditional forms of academic–industry relations, such as consulting and liaison programs that encourage ‘knowledge flows’
from academia to industry become less important as
an increasing number of companies look to external

825

sources for R & D or are themselves based upon
academic knowledge. As industrial sectors and universities move closer together, informal relationships
and knowledge flows are increasingly overlaid by
more intensive, formal institutional ties that arise
from centres and firms. As companies externalise
their R & D, they want more tangible inputs from
external sources such as universities. As one close
observer from the academic side of the equation put
it, ‘‘From the point of view of the company, they
tend to want a lot of bang for the buck . . . wtheyx tend
to not get involved in Affiliates programs precisely
because they can’t point to anything.’’ The growth of
centres and the formation of firms from academic
research have had unintended consequences that have
since become explicit goals: the creation of an industrial penumbra surrounding the university as well as
a growing academic ethos among older firms that
collaborate more closely with each other through
joint academic links.
The older forms of university–industry connections involved payment for services rendered,
whether it was received directly in the form of
consultation fees or indirectly as endowment gifts.
The new university–industry relationships involve
the multiplication of resources through the university’s and faculty members participation in capital
formation projects such as real estate development
and formation of firms. The capitalisation of knowledge, its transformation into equity capital by academics involving sectors of the university such as
basic science departments heretofore relatively uninvolved with industry, and the university’s emergence
as a leading participant in the economic development
of its region have shifted the direction of influence in
relationships between business and the university
from business to the university.
There are two dynamics at work in these activities: one is an extension of university research into
development, the other is an insertion into the university of industrial research goals, work practices
and development models. These activities may initially take place as isolated and separate initiatives.
At a later time, they may fold back upon each other
in spiral fashion and become integrated into each
other, for example, a centre that sets up an incubator
facility or a department that establishes its own
liaison office. The emergence of trends to commer-

<-----Page 3----->826

H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

cialise academic research is both an outcome of the
development of internal capacities to administer research services and a shift in the motivation of
faculty and administrators.

4. The capitalisation of knowledge
Max Weber, in his classic essay ‘Science as a
Vocation’ Ž1946. argued that scholars would lose
control of their means of production as the scale of
scientific instrumentation increased. Indeed, the separation of investigators from their research tools has
occurred in many laboratories as academic scientists
can more often be found in their offices than at the
laboratory bench. Although these researchers have
given up direct control of their instrumentation to
students and technicians, they have retained control
over the direction of its use. The dependence of
scientists on large scale research tools that they do
not own themselves has grown greater than in Weber’s time but the outcome is reversed: researchers
ability to capitalise knowledge has superseded the
proletarianization of scientists.
Moreover, computerisation and miniaturisation of
components is currently reducing the scale of scientific instrumentation. The recent closing of several
NSF supercomputer centres is an example of the
decreasing need for centralisation of research tools in
a few centres. Combined with the reproduction of
scientists outpacing replacement, more universities
are able to mount credible research programs in a
proliferation of niche areas. New topics have arisen
from interdisciplinary syntheses, local economic
needs and the intersection between the two, such as
the application of biotechnology or electronics to
traditional production processes.
As research decentralises to a broader range of
universities, including some that were not heretofore
known for their research strengths, competition
among universities for funds increases. Since research funding is not growing as fast as the number
of researchers seeking support, the impetus among
investigators to seek support from a broader range of
sources, including industrial firms, has thus grown
apace. The intersection of industry and academia is
also driven by the transformation of technology and
science from two largely separate enterprises, with

notable exceptional instances of crossover, into two
increasingly integrated and closely related activities.
As technological innovation becomes more closely
tied to research and vice versa, both organisationally
and cognitively, boundaries that were once sacrosanct are disregarded.
Cognitive changes are a crucial precondition of
these developments. As long as the traditional disjuncture between theory and invention is accepted,
the emergence of entrepreneurial science is an
anomaly, even a deviance from the shared normative
role model of scientific behavior. Entrepreneurial
scientists’ research is typically at the frontiers of
science and leads to theoretical and methodological
advance as well as invention of devices. These activities involve sectors of the university, such as basic
science departments, that heretofore, in principle,
limited their involvement with industry. One explanation for the emergence of entrepreneurial science
is that academic scientists, such as the founders of
biotechnology firms in the late 1970s and early
1980s, suddenly awakened to the financial opportunities emanating from their research. Implicit in this
explanation is the notion that there were recent scientific advances in molecular biology, polymers, materials science that could be quickly developed as
sources of profit. It may seem as if this cognitive
condition exists only in a small number of research
fields and scientific disciplines. But recent developments suggest that such a cognitive shape appears in
more and more scientific fields. For instance, linguistics, for a long time a purely curiosity-oriented basic
research field, suddenly became part of the emerging
transdisciplinary area of cognitive sciences which
has strong links to computer and software industry.
However, opportunities for commercial utilisation
of scientific research were often available to scientists in the past, such as the Curies, Marie and Pierre,
and Pasteur, who did not believe in crossing the
boundary between science and business themselves,
even though they evinced a strong interest in the
practical implications of their findings. What is new
in the present situation is that many academic scientists no longer believe in the necessity of an isolated
‘ivory tower’ to the working out of the logic of
scientific discovery. Heretofore, in the hiatus between scientific discovery and application, industry
was expected to have its scientists and engineers

<-----Page 4----->H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

pursue applied research and product development.
The model of separate spheres and technology transfer across strongly defined boundaries is still commonplace. However, academic scientists are often
eager and willing to marry the two activities, nominally carrying out one in their academic laboratory
and the other in a firm to which they maintain a
close relationship. A typical initial reaction of a
molecular biologist to the possibility of doing science for financial gain as well as the production of
knowledge was, ‘‘I never realised I had a trade,’’
later followed by, ‘‘I can do good science and make
money’’. In this final phase of normative change, a
significant number of persons share similar experiences and arrive at a common conclusion. This
conversion experience suggests the transmutation of
ambivalence—the opposition between two principles, one primary, the other secondary—into consonance and the reformation of ideological elements
into a consistent identity. Entrepreneurship is made
compatible with the conduct of basic research through
a legitimating theme that integrates the two activities
into a complementary relationship. For example, scientists often say that monies made from commercialising their research will be applied to furthering their
basic research interests.
Thus, technology transfer is a two-way flow from
university to industry and vice versa, with different
degrees and forms of academic involvement: Ž1. the
product originates in the university but its development is undertaken by an existing firm, Ž2. the
commercial product originates outside of the university, with academic knowledge utilised to improve
the product, or Ž3. the university is the source of the
commercial product and the academic inventor becomes directly involved in its commercialisation
through establishment of a new company.
In recent years, a non-linear recursive interaction
between theory and practice, academia and industry,
individual and group research has become an alternative academic mode. A significant number of faculty
members have adopted multiple objectives, ‘‘ . . . to
not only run a successful company . . . and start a
centre here ŽŽat the university.. that would become
internationally recognised’’ but to retain their traditional role as ‘individual investigator,’ directing a
research group. An ideal-typical entrepreneurial scientist held that the ‘‘ . . . interaction of constantly

827

going back and forth from the field, to the university
lab, to the industrial lab, has to happen all the time.’’
These relationships involve different levels of commitment Žfinancial and otherwise. by industrial sponsors, including the involvement of industrial sponsors in problem selection and research collaboration.
Conversely, the level of commitment required of a
university and its faculty in the commercialisation of
research varies in intensity according to the mechanism selected ŽMatkin, 1990..
Recognition of a congruence between basic research and invention vitiates the ideological separation of these spheres of activity. Until quite recently
most academic scientists assumed that the advancement of knowledge was synonymous with theoretical
innovation. Recent examples of research in which
theoretical advances have occurred in tandem with
the invention of devices or innovation in methodology in transistorsrsemiconductors, superconductivity and genetic engineering have called into question
the assumption of a one-way flow of knowledge
from basic to applied research to industrial innovation ŽGibbons et al., 1994.. The acceptance of dualisms such as patents vs. publication and basic vs.
applied research goals were the surface expressions
of a theory of knowledge based on an underlying
dichotomy that placed scientific advance, i.e., development of theory, in opposition to technological
advance. In an apparently growing number of scientific fields, this dualism is no longer a valid picture
of what happens.

5. Cognitive effects of entrepreneurialism on academic culture
A scientist, by choice of vocation, would heretofore have been assumed to have put aside all thoughts
of business-like activity to live a monk-like existence
as a searcher for truths about nature. The fictionalised ‘Arrowsmith’ character in the Sinclair Lewis
novel of the same name exemplified the scientific
researcher as an un-worldly, but determined, individual. Attired in a white lab coat to protect their street
clothing from chemical spills, the uniform of the
scientist also signified a certain purity of motives, an
abstraction from material concerns and a bemused
tendency toward absentmindedness in daily life

<-----Page 5----->828

H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

brought on by exclusivity of attention to science.
Researchers were expected to totally concentrate their
lives on running experiments in their laboratories
and writing up and publishing their results. They
were believed to find rewards for their discoveries
not in pecuniary advantage but in recognition from
their scientific peers through citation in the literature,
election to a national academy and the ultimate
accolade of the Nobel prize.
The term entrepreneurial scientist formerly referred solely to a teacher who attempted to secure
funds from external agencies in order to pursue
research within the university ŽVollmer, 1962.. It
was a label especially applied to those teachers who
devoted considerable effort to making applications to
granting agencies, whether successfully or unsuccessfully. It was often an ambivalent appellation.
While successful applicants were admired for their
ability to attract the attention of outside agencies and
amass funds, they were viewed by some colleagues
as less than pure academics for engaging in activities
removed from actual scholarship. Nevertheless, the
negative attributes of the term have diminished over
the years. This is especially true in the sciences,
where the ability to obtain funding to support a
laboratory and its personnel has virtually become a
prerequisite for doing science. Indeed, successfully
writing the proposals to fund ones own laboratory
has become the litmus test of having advanced along
the rite of passage from apprentice to attain the
status of a full-fledged scientist. In many departments it is a de-facto, and in some an openly recognised, requirement for a permanent appointment to
tenure.
A relatively small number of scientists, but some
of the most successful researchers, who are also the
intellectual leaders of their fields, operate at relatively high levels of funding. Professor Z. is described by colleagues as a ‘real entrepreneur,’ a man
who ‘has raised a fortune.’ Professor Z. himself
reports having raised about one million dollars in
research funds during the 1983–1984 academic year,
over half of it from corporate sources which is an
unusually high proportion for an academic scientist.
Prof. Z. said, ‘‘There are two ways of getting money
from industry that I know of. One is where they’re
just interested in your research, and they’ll give you
money to support the basic research they’re inter-

ested in return for . . . access to the lab, access to
your students, and pre-prints of the work they’re
supporting before it gets published . . . It’s not required but that’s what they like. But the biggest
money comes from industry in return for collaborative research. It’s like a contract . . . the work is generally publishable but not until they’ve gotten protection.’’ Through these arrangements, he can obtain
funding to keep his thirty-member laboratory operating. He said, ‘‘I wouldn’t let any industrial person
come to the laboratory to spend a year training or
something like that without a substantial investment
in our laboratory by the corporation.’’ At the same
time he could provide support for the university as a
whole, including US$300,000 in overhead payments
from companies. Despite this level of funding, Professor Z. found his current arrangements less than
fully satisfactory and expressed an interest in trying
new models in which he would participate in commercialising intellectual property rights rather than
passing them on to corporations in exchange for
research funds.
Professor Z. exemplifies the transition from a
kind of entrepreneurial habitus which was always
connected with academic research to the new entrepreneurialism which recently has begun to spread.
To put it in a nutshell, the new entrepreneurialism is
the old one plus the profit motive. Seeking for funds
has always been an important activity in the American research system which demands a lot of entrepreneurial energy and phantasy. Therefore, as soon
as traditional academic ambitions for the pursuit of
the truth could be combined with profit seeking, the
door was open for the new entrepreneurialism.

6. The entrepreneurial scientist
The closing gap between research and utilisation
of the fruits of research encourages faculty to look at
their research results from a dual perspective: Ž1. a
traditional research perspective in which publishable
contributions to the literature are entered into the
‘cycle of credibility’ ŽLatour and Woolgar, 1979.
and Ž2. an entrepreneurial perspective in which results are scanned for their commercial as well as
their intellectual potential. A public research university that we studied experienced a dramatic change

<-----Page 6----->H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

from a single to a dual mode of research salience. A
faculty member who lived through the change described the process, ‘‘When I first came here the
thought of a professor trying to make money was
anathema, . . . really bad form. That changed when
biotech happened.’’ Several examples of firm-formation encouraged by overtures from venture capitalists
led other faculty, at least in disciplines with similar
opportunities, to conclude that, ‘‘gosh these biochemists get to do this company thing, that’s kind of
neat, maybe its not so bad after all.’’ Once a university has established an entrepreneurial tradition, and
a number of successful companies, fellow faculty
members can offer material, in addition to moral,
support to their colleagues who are trying to establish a company of their own.
Faculty who have started their own firms also
become advisors to those newly embarking on a
venture. An aspiring faculty entrepreneur recalled
that a departmental colleague who had formed a
firm, ‘‘gave me a lot of advice . . . he was the role
model.’’ The availability of such role models makes
it more likely that other faculty members will form a
firm out of their research results, when the opportunity appears. A previous strata of university originated firms and professors who have made money
from founding their own firms creates a potential
cadre of ‘angels’ that prospective academic firm
founders can look to in raising funds to start their
firms. Early faculty firm founders at MIT were
known on campus for their willingness to supply
capital to help younger colleagues.
The success of the strategy to create a penumbra
of companies surrounding the university has given
rise to an industrial pull upon faculty members. For
example, a faculty member reported that: ‘‘The relationship with Collaborative wa biotechnology firm
that grew out of the Stony Brook incubatorx is
ongoing daily. We are always talking about what
project we are going to do next. What the priority is,
who is involved, there are probably six projects, a
dozen staff members and maybe close to a dozen
people scattered around three or four different departments on campus that are doing things with
them.’’ Geographical proximity makes a difference
in encouraging appropriate interaction. Such intensive interaction sheds new light on the question of
industrial influence on faculty research direction.

829

Thus, the ‘‘ . . . issue of investigator initiation is much
more complicated because I am bringing my investigator initiated technology to their company initiated
product. It is a partnership in which each partner
brings his own special thing. That is the only reason
they are talking. Do your thing on our stuff.’’ This is
still an intermediate case. Full integration of research
and entrepreneurship occurs wherever scientists
found their own firms to continue pursuing a particular kind of research from basic issues to concrete
products for the market. Previous conflicts based on
an assumption of a dividing line between the academic and industrial sides of a relationship are superseded as divisions disappear. A more integrated
model of academic–industry relations is emerging
along with a diversified network of transfer institutions.
Potential products are often produced as a normal
part of the research process, especially as software
becomes commonplace in collecting and analysing
data. As a faculty member commented in the mid1980s, ‘‘In universities we tend to be very good at
producing software, wwex produce it incidentally. So
there is a natural affiliation there. My guess is a lot
of what you are going to see in university–industry
interaction is going to be in the software area.’’ In
the 1990s this phenomenon has spread well beyond
the research process, with software produced in
academia outside of the laboratory, and start-ups
emerging from curriculum development and other
academic activities.
In an era when results are often embodied in
software, sharing research results takes on a dimension of complexity well beyond reproducing and
mailing a pre-print or reprint of an article. Software
must be debugged, maintained, enhanced, translated
to different platforms to be useful. These activities
require organisational and financial resources well
beyond the capacity of an academic lab and its
traditional research supporters, especially if the demand is great and the software complex. As one of
the researchers described the dilemma of success,
‘‘We had an NSF grant that supported wour researchx
and many people wanted us to convert our programs
to run on other machines. We couldn’t get support
Žon our grant. to do that and our programs were very
popular. We were sending them out to every place
that had machines available that could run them.’’

<-----Page 7----->830

H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

The demand grew beyond the ability of the academic
laboratory to meet it. Firm formation, in this instance, was driven by the norms of academic collegiality, mandating sharing of research results. When
the federal research funding system was not able or
willing to expand the capabilities of a laboratory to
meet the demand for the software that its research
support had helped create, the researchers reluctantly
turned to the private sector. They decided that,
‘‘Since we couldn’t get support, we thought perhaps
the commercial area was the best way to get the
technology that we developed here at Stanford out
into the commercial domain.’’ The researchers also
tried and failed to find an existing company to
develop and market the software. As one of the
researchers described their efforts, ‘‘We initially
looked for companies that might license it from us,
. . . none were really prompted to maintain or develop the software further.’’ Failure to identify an
existing firm to market a product is a traditional
impetus to inventors, who strongly believe in their
innovation, to form a firm themselves to bring it to
market.
Chemists involved with molecular modelling, previously a highly theoretical topic, have also had to
face the exigencies of software distribution as their
research tools increasingly became embodied in software. Since the interest in the software is not only
from academic labs but from companies who can
afford to pay large sums, the possibility opens up of
building a company around a program or group of
programs and marketing them to industry at commercial rates while distributing to academia at a
nominal cost. Academic firm founders thus learn to
balance academic and commercial values. In one
instance, as members of the Board, the academics
were able to influence the firm to find a way to make
a research tool available to the academic community
at modest cost. An academic described the initial
reaction to the idea, ‘‘The rest of the board were
venture capitalists, you can imagine how they felt!
They required we make a profit.’’ On the other hand,
‘‘It was only because we were very academically
oriented and we said, look, it doesn’t matter if this
company doesn’t grow very strongly at first. We
want to grow slow and do it right and provide the
facilities to academics.’’ The outcome was a compromise between the two sides, meeting academic

and business objectives at the same time, through the
support of a government research agency to partially
subsidise academic access to the firm’s product.
A biotech incubator company at Stony Brook kept
one eye on academia, the other on industry. The
cognitive focus in this firm is on developing techniques that could be useful in research in academic
labs and in larger companies. An academic lab might
also develop techniques but their orientation would
be more focused on the discoveries that might result
from the techniques rather than the techniques themselves. Nevertheless, other biotechnology firms operate in a dual mode interested both in marketing
techniques but also in using them for discovery
within the firm. The incubator company also operated in a dual research and production mode. One of
its scientists said, ‘‘So we have this kind of constant
production operation which is going on and takes a
little of our time, and the rest of it is research. And
everybody basically does some of both.’’

7. A typology of interaction with industry
The university, and an increasing number of its
faculty, have learned how to pursue basic research in
tandem with the capitalisation of knowledge. Support
for faculty involvement in technology transfer varied
widely from active encouragement to active discouragement. In an expression of the traditional view a
faculty member reported that his chair ‘‘ . . . regarded
the wcompany namex money as bad money, dirty
money. He was an NIH ŽNational Institute of Health.
man all the way.’’ Nevertheless, there has been a
change of attitude among many faculty members in
the sciences toward industrial funding; a shift away
from the old view of industrial money as unacceptable. Three styles of participation in technology
transfer have emerged among the Stony Brook faculty, reflecting increasing degrees of industrial involvement. These approaches can be characterised as
Ž1. hands off, leave the matter entirely to the transfer
office; Ž2. knowledgeable participant, aware of the
potential commercial value of research and willing to
play a significant role in arranging its transfer to
industry; and Ž3. seamless web, integration of campus research group and research program of a firm.
Of course, many faculty fit in the fourth cell of ‘no

<-----Page 8----->H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

interest’ or non-involvement. These researchers are
often referred to under the rubric of the federal
agency that is their primary source of support as in,
‘She is an NIH person.’
The approach of leaving it up to the technology
transfer office to find a developer and marketer for a
discovery precisely met the needs of many faculty
members, then and now, who strictly delimit their
role in putting their technology into use. A faculty
member delineated this perspective on division of
labour in technology transfer: ‘‘It would depend on
the transfer office expertise and their advice. I am
not looking to become a business person. I really am
interested in seeing if this could be brought into the
market. I think it could have an impact on people’s
lives. It is an attractive idea.’’ This attitude does not
necessarily preclude a start-up firm, but it does
exclude the possibility that the faculty member will
be the entrepreneur.
A stance of moderate involvement is becoming
more commonplace, with scientists becoming knowledgeable and comfortable operating in a business
milieu while retaining their primary interest and
identity as an academic scientist. A faculty member
exemplifying this approach expressed the view that:
‘‘In science you kind of sit down and you share
ideas . . . There tends to be a very open and very
detailed exchange. The business thing when you sit
down with somebody, the details are usually done
later and you have to be very careful about what you
say with regard to details because that is what business is about: keeping your arms around your details
so that you can sell them to somebody else, otherwise there is no point.’’ Faculty are learning to
calibrate their interaction to both scientific and business needs, giving out enough information to interest
business persons in their research but not so much so
that a business transaction to acquire the knowledge
becomes superfluous. Another researcher said, ‘‘I
am thinking about what turns me on, in terms of
scientific interest and the money is something if I
can figure out how to get it then it is important but it
is certainly not the most important thing to me.’’ The
primary objective is still scientific; business objectives are strictly secondary.
Many companies, both large established and startups, want a closer, more involved relationship with
the academic scientists that they work with. Such a

831

collaborative approach makes the old model of licensing intellectual property into an initial first step
in setting the ground rules as to how the relationship
should be structured and any profits divided. But
once the contract is signed a much higher degree of
involvement is expected of both parties. As one
faculty member described the changed situation:
‘‘More and more the company’s attitude is we want
you with your unique expertise to contribute, not to
the development of an as yet uninvented product, but
to the definition of this product which we as a
company may need . . . ’’ In this model the professor
becomes involved in helping set the strategic research direction of the company rather than merely
handing over a technology, developed as a by-product of academic research, that happens to coincide
with a corporate need.
Relations with industry have become further complicated as companies see the university as a potential competitor through its role in the creation of new
firms. Although some academics and industrialists
wish the university to return to its traditional role of
training students and publishing research findings,
many states and local governments fund centres and
programs to encourage academic institutions to generate new economic activity from the campus. Indeed, venture capitalists advise prospective academic
founders of companies that the best way to launch
their firm is to remain on campus and work with
students to develop the early stages of their technology. Although many academics would prefer to return to an era when federal support was sufficient to
meet the needs of their research enterprise, few see
this as a realistic possibility. The conflicts are no
longer about whether the university should pursue
knowledge for profit, but over the shape that organisational innovations to accommodate industry connections will take ŽEtzkowitz et al., 1998..
An interesting further development of academy–
industry relations is the concept of ‘discovery exchange’ at the University of Colorado, Boulder, invented by a departmental chairperson and a venture
capitalist. The Discovery Exchange plan drew out
the logical implications of university technology
transfer efforts and carried them to a new height. The
idea was to generate significant income by raising
venture capital funds to commercialise a much larger
proportion of academic research than even the most

<-----Page 9----->832

H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

entrepreneurial university to date. The Discovery
Exchange was based on the premise that only a small
portion of university research is patented despite
universities having the right and the obligation by
law to seek commercialisation possibilities as a condition of accepting federal research funds. Given
their financial constraints university technology
transfer offices ‘‘ . . . seek patents on only the ‘ost
promising’ ideas, as judged by industry contacts,
expert consultants, and, in some cases, by a company’s expressed willingness to license a new invention once the office patents it’’ ŽGold, 1990.. Only
the immediately available obvious candidates for
commercialisation were patented.
In contrast, the Discovery Exchange plan envisioned an aggressive and expensive strategy. Patents
would be taken out on a wide range of potentially
useful research results, irrespective of current estimates of their commercial value, on the premise that
a significant number of these patents would accrue
value that could not be entirely foreseen in advance
in the interim before their lapse. To draw upon the
research capacity of academic staff more effectively
than traditional means of encouraging faculty to
bring potential commercialisable research to the attention of a university office, the Discovery Exchange proposed to have one of its staff sit in on the
meetings of research groups to help identify potentially commercialisable knowledge. The Discovery
Exchange proposal stated that, ‘‘Providing that the
directors of a laboratory give their consent, the
churner will participate in laboratory research meetings, follow on-going experiments, and join in the
intellectual life of the laboratories.’’ ŽGold and
Butcher, 1989: 14.. Based upon the assumption that
not all academic staff were aware of potential uses
for their research the ‘churners’ would join the research group to monitor for useful results. They
would, ‘‘ . . . attend the lab meetings of the faculty
member . . . prepared to recognise the commercial
potential of discoveries’’ ŽGold and Butcher, 1989:
20.. It was also planned to hire sufficient legal staff
to allow the filing of ten times a many applications
as a typical university patent office and six times as
much as the most active.
The implantation of the Discovery Exchange
would make technology transfer an integral part of
the everyday operation of the university. The cogni-

tive effects are manifest among both supporters and
detractors. In interviews, both proponents and opponents of the Discovery Exchange professed their
faith in the ‘meandering stream’ of basic research.
Although the Discovery Exchange representative was
intended as a non-obtrusive participant in the research group, the introduction of such a presence
was argued as having the potential to influence
research direction. An opponent said, ‘‘They used a
wonderful and I think a totally self-defeating agricultural metaphor. They were going to put these cultivators in peoples laboratories, churners they were
called, interestingly enough. In a perfect business
approach to it faculty were going to be invited to be
churners so some of us could make some money out
of this thing because we would be intermediaries
between the Discovery Exchange and a particular
laboratory. So somebody has a lab and one of us,
either another scientist in that field or someone else
who has a larger perspective would go to those
meetings, sit around and help to steer the choices in
a direction that would have more payoff, potential
payoff, for patentable ideas for industrially relevant
kinds of works. These churners would be participating in the scholarly process and then they would
harvest this stuff’’ ŽJessor, 1990.. As a consequence
of such criticism, the churners, attorneys and venture
capital arm of the Exchange were replaced by a more
modest effort that would nevertheless promote the
formation of companies from faculty research and
allow the university to maintain an equity interest in
these firms. Although the leading proponent of the
Exchange was sceptical of this more modest effort
Ž‘‘The university plan is worse than nothing’’; Gold,
1993., but in principle it represented a considerable
expansion of the university’s technology transfer efforts ŽHarpel, 1993..

8. Conclusion: the industrial penumbra of the
university
Controversies such as the one about the Discovery
Exchange show that it is still a long way to a
full-blown establishment of entrepreneurial science.
Universities are undergoing a ‘second revolution’
these days, incorporating economic and social development as part of their mission ŽEtzkowitz, in press..

<-----Page 10----->H. Etzkowitzr Research Policy 27 (1998) 823–833

The first academic revolution, taking off in the
late nineteenth century in the U.S., made research an
academic function in addition to the traditional task
of teaching ŽJencks and Riesman, 1968.. This revolution is by no means finished. But in the most advanced segments of the worldwide university system,
a ‘second revolution’ takes off. The entrepreneurial
university integrates economic development into the
university as an academic function along with teaching and research. It is this ‘capitalisation of knowledge’ that is the heart of a new mission for the
university, linking universities to users of knowledge
more tightly and establishing the university as an
economic actor in its own right.
