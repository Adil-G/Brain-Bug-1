ABSTRACT
In his widely reprinted paper ‘‘On the Folly of Rewarding A, While Hoping for B,’’ Kerr
argued that vividness was one of the major reasons for distorted rewards. Using both
archival and survey data, the present paper directly tests Kerr’s proposal by investigating whether, how, and why highly visible behaviors are over-rewarded and less
visible, but similarly (or more) important behaviors are under-rewarded. The National
Basketball Association (NBA) was chosen as the domain of this study because scoring
is particularly vivid, even though both non-scoring and scoring performances are
critical for winning games. Findings from four studies demonstrated that the scoring
performance of NBA players was weighed more heavily than their non-scoring
performance. Scorers were rewarded with higher salaries and received more support
in the NBA All-Star balloting than defenders, even though they might not necessarily
make more contribution than their teammates. This pattern of ﬁndings suggests that the
vividness effect may lead to pronounced differences in people’s judgments, especially
when they face abundant real-world information with similar validity. Copyright #

INTRODUCTION
Information varies in many ways. Information is vivid when it is ‘‘emotionally interesting, concrete, and
imagery provoking; and proximate in a sensory, temporal, or spatial way’’ (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, p. 45).
Theories suggest that people inferentially and judgmentally weigh information in accordance with its
vividness (Nisbett & Ross, 1980). Thus, vividness is supposed to bias managerial judgment and decision
making (Bazerman, 2002). Kerr (1975) argued more than three decades ago that vividness was one of the
major reasons for distorted rewards in organizations. He suggested that certain behaviors are under-rewarded
simply because they are less visible rather than less important. For example, ‘‘scoring baskets and

hitting home runs are more readily observable than feeding teammates and advancing base runners’’ (Kerr,
1975, p. 780).
A more recent poll revealed that Kerr’s folly of rewarding A, while hoping for B was still widespread in
corporate America today (Kerr, 1995). Because of mixed empirical evidence on vividness effects in the
experimental literature (Taylor & Thompson, 1982; Taylor & Wood, 1983), however, Kerr’s original
arguments have not been adequately researched. Thus, this paper directly tests of Kerr’s proposal by
exploring whether, how, and why individual and organizational representatives bias reward allocations when
some tasks are more vivid than others.
In particular, the present research probes whether vividness may lead to distorted rewards in a real-world
setting, in which highly visible behaviors are over-rewarded and less visible behaviors are similarly
important, yet under-rewarded. Based on Kerr’s own example, I examined this phenomenon in the National
Basketball Association (NBA). Using both archival and survey data, I tested the effects of vividness on NBA
players’ salaries and selection as All-Stars.
Perhaps one of the most famous axioms in team sports, especially basketball, is ‘‘offense wins games,
defense wins championships.’’ If this widely accepted adage is true, defensive prowess should carry more
weight than offensive competency in NBA teams’ investments in their players. However, as a team game,
basketball also needs different contributions from different players. A team cannot win without scoring; but at
the same time it must prevent the other team from scoring more to win. Thus, defense should be at least as
important as, if not more important than offense in the NBA (Chatterjee, Campbell, & Wiseman, 1994; Hoﬂer
& Payne, 2004).
As Kerr (1975) suggested, however, scoring baskets, is more vivid than blocking shots or rebounding. The
most frequently referenced statistics of basketball concern scoring, probably because it is easily observed and
attracts more attention. Although other aspects of performance, such as assists and rebounds, are also
important, they may not be as exciting and observable as scoring. Thus, if it is vivid, NBA players’ scoring is
likely to have a greater impact on their salaries and All-Star votes than their defensive performance.
Therefore, I hypothesized that shooters will be paid more lavishly and receive more votes in the NBA All-Star
balloting program than defenders or even all-around players. I tested my hypotheses in four studies using both
archival and survey data. Study 1 showed the vividness effect of scoring on both salaries and All-Star votes
based on publicly available data of current NBA players. Study 2 replicated the ﬁndings of Study 1 using
survey data from NBA fans. It suggested that vividness might subconsciously work against one’s real beliefs.
Studies 3 and 4 used behaviorally based measures to conﬁrm the ﬁndings of the ﬁrst two studies. I then
discuss the ﬁndings in terms of their general implications for understanding vividness effects in
organizational decision making.

Vividness
Vividness has a long history in the information processing literature. Tversky and Kahneman (1973, 1974)
ﬁrst documented that people can fall prey to availability heuristics because of easier retrieval. Some
memories are easier to recall than others, and people may overestimate their chance of occurrence (Tversky
& Kahneman, 1983). Thus, vivid events carry disproportional weight in shaping attitudes and opinions
(Nisbett & Ross, 1980), especially in fuzzy or indistinct situations (Slovic, 1993) because people
interpret ambiguous or complex information based on the most accessible concepts (Higgins, Rholes, &
Jones, 1977).
When people make judgments, they ﬁrst need to recall relevant information (Schwarz, 1998). This process
depends on the nature of the content to be recalled and the ease with which it can be brought to mind (Schwarz
& Vaughn, 2002). If the content to be recalled is vivid, it is more likely to be stored; it is also likely to be
readily available, reducing the difﬁculty of recall. Vivid information may also activate greater cognitive
elaboration than other information because it is more likely to be pondered and rehearsed (Nisbett & Ross,

1980). In particular, when people’s attention is constrained, vivid information may attract more attention and
weigh more heavily than ‘‘pallid and abstract propositions of substantially greater probative and evidentiary
value’’ (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, p. 44). Thus, people are prone to overestimating unlikely but vivid events
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).
Several studies support this logic. For example, Nisbett and Borgida (1975) showed that people based their
predictions more on vivid case-based information than base rates. Stapel and Velthuijsen (1996) found that
people reported a higher likelihood of being a victim of a car accident when they had read a newspaper report
of a car accident that is vivid rather than pallid. Vivid persuasion also inﬂuences jury judgments (Bell &
Loftus, 1985): it biases perceptions of disputants (Wilson, Northcraft, & Neale, 1989) and causes observers to
judge a defendant more harshly (Reyes, Thompson, & Bower, 1980). Vividness is also a particularly effective
advertising strategy: Vivid imagery (Babin & Burns, 1997) and affect-laden photographs (Mitchell, 1986)
affect consumers’ attitudes toward an advertisement and their behavioral intentions to purchase a product.
Other studies, however, have demonstrated that vivid information does not always inﬂuence judgment
more than pallid information (Taylor & Thompson, 1982; Werner & Latane, 1976, for reviews) and that it
may even undermine persuasion (Frey & Eagly, 1993). In their comprehensive review, Taylor and Thompson
(1982) found that empirical evidence of vividness effects was actually unclear in spite of the wide acceptance
of the impact of vivid information. The effect of vividness appears to be far from simple (Nisbett & Ross,
1980), and the real-world conditions that are necessary to produce vividness effects are not always available
in the laboratory (Taylor & Thompson, 1982; Taylor & Wood, 1983).
The current research is an attempt to examine whether, how, and why vividness, an important judgment
and decision-making construct, may lead to distorted rewards in a real-world setting. The NBA offers an
interesting context for studying vividness because the scoring performance of NBA players seems to satisfy
all of the criteria of vivid information: ‘‘(1) emotionally interesting, (2) concrete and imagery provoking; (3)
proximate in a sensory, temporal or spatial way’’ (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, p. 45). First, professional basketball
activates the emotions of players, coaches, and fans. Second, scoring performance is easily observable and
excites the imagination of a team’s hopeful supporters. Finally, scoring is proximate and intense: Scoring
dominates basketball coverage, reinforcing the impact on one’s judgments and inferences. For example,
when Kobe Bryant scored 81 points in one game, sports pages and commentary were buzzing. For the same
reason, Wilt Chamberlain is always widely famous for his single-game 100-point scoring record rather than
his single-game rebound record. In fact, many ardent fans do not know that he phenomenally grabbed 55
rebounds in a single game.
Staw and Hoang’s (1995) study of the sunk cost effect of draft number on players’ survival in the NBA also
showed that scoring was a stronger predictor of playing time and survival in the league than any other
performance component, suggesting that the vividness of scoring may also overly inﬂuence coaches. This
discussion suggests that:
H1: Scoring performance is more positively related to vividness than non-scoring performance in the
NBA.

Subjective assessment and fascination with ‘‘objective’’ criterion
Vividness is important because it leads to biased decision making (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). Kerr (1975)
argued that vividness was one of the major reasons behind biased compensation. Overpayment and inequity
between pay and performance are not uncommon in professional sports. For example, Blass (1992) reported
that wages in major league baseball increased with tenure independently of productivity gains. Yet, no clear
data have shown that vividness is one of the causes.
Analyses of pay often suffer from two major assessment problems: subjective assessments and
oversimpliﬁed quantiﬁcations. Subjective assessments, based on limited data of limited validity, are prone to

23

heuristics and biases (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Yet, subjective assessments are used in compensating
both top executives and workers (Fast & Berg, 1975; Hayes & Schaefer, 2000), and have an important impact
on many incentive contracts (Gibbons, 1998, 2005).
Oversimpliﬁed objective quantiﬁcations can also distort compensation decisions. Simple and quantiﬁable
objective standards are useful when performance is predictable and easily quantiﬁable (Kerr, 1975).
However, much organizational performance is neither predictable nor quantiﬁable; hence Kerr (1975) warns
that such practices can easily backﬁre.
The vividness effect can enhance both subjective assessments and oversimpliﬁed quantiﬁcations. On the
one hand, when people rely on subjective assessments, they tend to process information according to heuristic
rules (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Highly vivid performance is more accessible and more likely to be
overweighed in subjective assessments. On the other hand, a major criticism of using quantiﬁable objective
standards is ‘‘overemphasis on highly visible behaviors’’ (Kerr, 1975, p. 780) when performance requires an
array of visible and not so visible behaviors. This may be because less visible performance usually attracts
less attention, leading to underestimates of its importance. Logically, the folly of underrewarding desired
behavior can be attributed both to overemphasis on highly visible behaviors and underestimation of less vivid
behaviors (Kerr, 1975).
Decisions about NBA players’ salaries are likely to be subject to the same biases. Scoring baskets is more
readily observable than effectively passing the ball to teammates. Thus, scoring performance is likely to be
weighted more than other types of performance in NBA teams’ salary calculations. In contrast, the relatively
lower visibility of non-scoring performance may lead it to be underweighted in spite of its important overall
contribution to team performance (Chatterjee et al., 1994; Hoﬂer & Payne, 2004). Hence:
H2a: NBA players’ salaries are more likely to be predicted by their scoring than their non-scoring
performance.
H2b: Vividness will positively mediate the relationship between NBA player’s scoring performance and
their salaries.

Vividness persuasion and all-star voting
Vividness should also be evident in decisions regarding who should play on the All-Star team because the
most vivid shooters often outshine other great players in the public and the media. As a result, the decisions of
NBA fans may also be subject to the inﬂuence of vividness.
Vividness inﬂuences persuasion via three mechanisms (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Taylor & Thompson, 1982).
First, vivid information and non-vivid information compete for people’s constrained attention (Taylor &
Thompson, 1982). Vivid information captures more emotional and cognitive attention, and therefore is likely
to be more persuasive. Second, vivid information prompts more information processing and cognitive
elaboration. Third, vivid information normally remains in memory longer, potentially activating additional
information from memory that leads to the same inferential conclusions.
These explanations suggest how the vividness of scoring can affect NBA fans’ judgments and
decisions. First, although scoring and non-scoring performances will compete for NBA fans’ attention
when they watch a game, the emotional and sensory vividness of scoring is likely to draw more of their
attention. Second, scoring performance may also activate greater cognitive elaboration, for example, via
passionate discussions, than non-scoring performance such as assisting or rebounding. Consequently,
scoring ability should be more persuasive than defensive prowess in shaping fans’ preferences for and
support of NBA players. Third, the vividness of scoring should keep it in memory longer than non-scoring
performance. Thus, the vivid information of scoring performance is more likely to be available to NBA
fans when they vote for their favorite All-Star players. It may also stimulate additional memories of

similar information and activate favorable associations, strengthening fans’ favorable judgments of
high-scoring NBA players.
H3a: NBA players’ scoring performance is more likely to positively predict their All-Star votes than their
non-scoring performance.
H3b: Vividness will positively mediate the relationship between NBA players’ scoring performance and
their All-Star votes.

STUDY 1
Study 1 used archival data to examine the vividness effect in the NBA. Publicly available data provided
unique advantages for testing my hypotheses because they not only included rich and real information about
players’ performance, salaries, and All-Star votes, but also allowed me to control for a whole set of real-world
factors such as player’s demographic information, tenure in the league. Also, to my knowledge, no previous
study has documented the vividness effect outside the laboratory. Thus, using archival data might also
provide some special value for the investigation of vividness effects in the real world.

Methods
Sample and data
The salary data1 for 304 current NBA players, whose most recent contracts were signed between 1997 and
2005, were collected from the USA Today NBA salaries database. The performance data were collected
from NBA ofﬁcial website, ESPN NBA webpage, and databasebasketball.com. Based on players’ 2004–
2005 salaries and contracts, I ﬁrst determined the years when they signed their most recent contracts. I
collected players’ performance data as of the date they signed their contracts. For example, if a player signed
his most recent contract on 1 August 2003, I collected his performance data in the 2002–2003 season.
Because rookies did not have prior NBA performance, their data were not included.
Because All-Star ballot information was only available for the top 10 players in each region, I used
All-Star voting data collected from the website of www.dfw.net for the 2003–2004 Season on 50 players.

Dependent variables
Salary and All-Star votes were the two dependent variables. Salary was based on each player’s most recent
contract. Because many players had multiple-year contracts, I averaged their salaries across the years of their
contracts. For All-Star votes, I used the number of votes received in the 2003–2004 season. Both the salary
and All-Star votes were log transformed to normalize the distributions.

Independent variables
Scoring performance. Scoring performance was measured by the number of points players scored per minute
in each season. I used the number of points players scored per minute rather than per game to make the
measure of scoring consistent with the measure of non-scoring performance. An analysis using per game
measures produced similar results.

The salary data do not contain performance bonuses because that information was not readily available (Harder, 1992).

Non-scoring performance. To reduce multicollinearity, I used a composite index, developed by the Sports
News and used by previous research (e.g., Harder, 1992), to measure non-scoring performance:
Non  scoring ¼

REB þ ASST þ BLK þ STL  ðFGA  FGMÞ  ðFTA  FTMÞ
Minutes

where REB is the number of rebounds, ASST is the number of assists, BLK is the number of blocked shots,
STL is the number of steals, FGA is the ﬁeld goals attempted, FGM is the ﬁeld goals made, FTA is the free
throws attempted, FTM is the free throws made, and minutes is the number of minutes played.
This composite index2 represents a standardized measure of non-scoring performance, and it reﬂects a
player’s overall non-scoring contribution to his team (Harder, 1992). But it may not fully represent all of the
traditional statistics of non-scoring performance. Thus, I also tested my hypotheses by comparing the effects
of each speciﬁc non-scoring performance subcategory (e.g., assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals) separately
with that of scoring. The results of these additional analyses were in strong agreement with those reported
below, which are more parsimonious.
Both scoring and non-scoring performance were standardized. As shown in Table 1, the correlation
between scoring and non-scoring performance was negative and signiﬁcant (r ¼ .47, p < .01). Although the
correlation was relatively high, the two independent variables clearly represent two different constructs.
Vividness. In the NBA, a player’s vividness is often reﬂected by regular media coverage. Thus, I measured
vividness by the number of news reports of each player’s performance in the online news archive. For the
salary hypothesis, I counted the number of online newspapers covering each player’s performance in the
season right before he signed his most recent contract. For the All-Star vote hypothesis, I selected the online
newspapers reporting each All-Star candidate’s performance in the 2003–2004 season. I tried to restrict
newspapers to those using vivid-related words to report performance to ensure that the papers reﬂected
vividness of performance.3 I only included English news to reduce possible redundancy and variations caused
by differences in languages and translation. I also log transformed the variable to normalize the distribution.
Control variables4
Like previous studies on the NBA (e.g., Harder, 1992; Kahn & Shah, 2005; Staw & Hoang, 1995), I used the
following control variables to isolate other possible effects.
Years. For salary-related hypotheses, I included eight dummy variables for each year, with year 1997 as the
reference category, to control for any time-speciﬁc variation.
Tenure. Players’ tenure in the league was another control variable. Virtually all the players included in this
study were subject to the 1999 collective bargaining agreement (NBA, January, 1999), which set speciﬁc
salary caps based on years of service and established seniority-speciﬁc minima (Kahn & Shah, 2005).
Clearly, players’ salaries are affected by their years of service under this agreement. In particular, the rookie
contracts are likely to be constrained most severely. Because I excluded rookies from my analyses, the results
2
It is worth noting that the original equation included scoring-related measures such as ﬁeld goals and free throws. To avoid any possible
conﬂations, I also analyzed the data by using a modiﬁed equation without these scoring-related measures. The test results did not
materially change. Thus, these results use the original equation.
3
The news articles devoted to each NBA player might also include other information such as popularity, marketing, salary. The numbers
reported here attempted to eliminate as many of these instances as possible.
4
In the regression analysis, I also controlled for other variables such as contract length, age, performance ranking, All-Star status (for
salary hypothesis). I tested my hypotheses with and without these additional control variables and the results did not materially change.
They were not reported in the paper for the sake of simplicity.

were unlikely to be inﬂuenced heavily by seniority-based differentiation after each player’s years of service
were controlled.
Position. I created ﬁve dummy variables (center, guard, center-forward, forward-center, and forward),5 with
guard or forward being the reference category when testing H2a and H2b about salaries. In contrast, because
of the simpler position categorization in the All-Star data, I used two dummy variables (center and forward)
to test H3a and H3b about All-Star votes, with guard being the reference category.
Playing time6. NBA players’ salaries and selection for All-Stars should also be related to their playing time.
Thus, players’ playing time in each season, in terms of minutes played, was controlled. The number of
minutes was log transformed to improve normality.
Team performance. Because team performance might also have an impact on players’ status, it was also
controlled for in the analyses of All-Star voting. It was measured by winning ratio (number of games won
divided by number of games lost). Because the contract years of NBA players vary and many players changed
teams when they signed their new contracts, team performance was not controlled for the salary analyses.

Results
Overall, the vividness predictions were supported. Scoring performance was more highly correlated with
vividness than non-scoring performance. Scoring was also more strongly related to salaries than non-scoring;
and All-Star votes followed the same pattern. Vividness mediated the effects of scoring on both salaries and
All-Star votes.
Tables 1 and 2 report the correlations among the study variables and descriptive statistics for the
salary-related and All-Star voting-related variables, respectively. Tables 3 and 4 present the regression
results.
H1 predicted that scoring performance would be more positively related to vividness than non-scoring
performance. This hypothesis was supported: vividness was positively related to scoring performance

The original dataset in USA Today categorized some of the players in more than one position. Some examples include Ben Wallace
(Forward-Center) in 2003 and Tracy McGrady (F-G) in 2005. Thus, I created the dummy variables based on these categories.
6
I originally chose to control both minutes and number of games because some bench players might not be measured clearly by one
criterion alone. However, as expected, the two variables were highly correlated with each other (r ¼ .892, p < .01). Hence, I dropped the
numbers of games, and only used the numbers of minutes each player played for the ﬁnal analyses.

(r ¼ .62, p < .01 in salary analyses, r ¼ .50, p < .01 in All-Star vote analyses); its relationship with
non-scoring performance was negative (r ¼ .26, p < .01 in salary analyses, r ¼ .09, n.s. in All-Star vote
analyses).
H2a predicted that scoring performance would have a stronger impact on players’ salaries than
non-scoring performance. This hypothesis was supported. Model 1 in Table 3 was the baseline model
including only control variables. To directly compare the variance accounted for by scoring and non-scoring
performance, Model 2 added non-scoring and scoring performances. Adding both variables greatly improved
the baseline model: compared with the baseline model, the R2 improved signiﬁcantly from 52.9 to 68.3%
( p < .001). In model 2, both scoring (bscoring ¼ .55, p < .0001) and non-scoring (bnon-scoring ¼ .24;
p < .001) were positively related to salaries. As predicted, however, scoring was more signiﬁcantly related to
salaries than non-scoring: analyzing variance accounted for was in agreement with the prediction. When I
added non-scoring performance to the equation of controls plus scoring performance predicting salaries, the
R2 change was .03 ( p < .001). When I added scoring to the equation of controls plus non-scoring performance
predicting salaries, the R2 change was .15 ( p < .001). Overall, H2 was supported: NBA players’ salaries were
more likely to be predicted by their scoring performance than their non-scoring performance.
Model 3 tests the interaction between scoring and non-scoring. Adding the interaction term did not
signiﬁcantly improve the model (R2 ¼ .001, p ¼ .49). The interaction between scoring and non-scoring
performances was also not signiﬁcant (bscoring  non-scoring ¼ .024, p ¼ .49). This suggests that being
good at both scoring and non-scoring does not necessarily enhance one’s salary.
H2b predicted that vividness would positively mediate the relationship between scoring and salaries. The
hypothesis was supported. Model 5 included vividness as another independent variable. It was signiﬁcant and
positive (b ¼ .28, p < .0001), indicating a positive relationship between vividness and salaries. Mediational
analyses supported the mediation effects of vividness. The results revealed a partial mediation effect of
vividness based on Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger’s (1998) approach. First, scoring was signiﬁcantly related to
salaries (bscoring ¼ .62, p < .0001). Second, vividness was signiﬁcantly related to salaries (bvividness ¼ .61,
p < .0001). Third, scoring was signiﬁcantly related to vividness (bvividness ¼ .62, p < .0001). Fourth, a
signiﬁcant relationship between vividness and salaries existed (bscoring ¼ .36, p < .0001) when scoring was
controlled for. Finally, the relationship between scoring and salaries was smaller, but still signiﬁcant
(bscoring ¼ .40, p < .0001) after controlling for vividness. A Sobel test conﬁrmed the positive mediation
effect of vividness on the relationship between scoring and salary (Z ¼ 6.01, p < .001). In contrast, vividness
negatively mediated the relationship between non-scoring and salary (Z ¼ 4.52, p < .001).
H3a predicted that scoring would have a larger impact on All-Star votes than non-scoring performance.
Model 1 in Table 4, the baseline model containing only the control variables, was not signiﬁcant (F (6, 42) ¼
1.63, p ¼ .16). Model 2 added non-scoring and scoring performances. Adding both variables signiﬁcantly
improved the baseline model (F change ¼ 5.34, p ¼ .009; R2 change ¼ .17, p ¼ .009). Model 2 was signiﬁcant
(F (8, 40) ¼ 2.81, p ¼ .014); both scoring (bscoring ¼ .59, p < 0.01) and non-scoring (bnon-scoring ¼ .45;
p ¼ .03) were positively and signiﬁcantly related to All-Star votes. However, it was worth noting that without
controlling for scoring performance, the relationship between non-scoring and All-Star votes is not
signiﬁcant (bnon-scoring ¼ .097, n.s.).
Analyzing the variance accounted for by scoring and non-scoring performances suggests that scoring is
related to All-Star votes more than non-scoring: the R2 change was .08 ( p ¼ .03), when adding non-scoring
performance to the equation of controls plus scoring performance predicting All-Star votes. In contrast, the
R2 change was .15 ( p < .01) when adding scoring performance to the equation of controls plus non-scoring
performance predicting All-Star votes. Overall, H3a was supported: scoring was a better predictor of All-Star
votes than non-scoring.
Model 3 tests the interaction between scoring and non-scoring. Adding the interaction term marginally
improved the model (F change ¼ 3.34; R2 ¼ .05, p ¼ .08). The interaction effect between scoring and
non-scoring was negative and marginally signiﬁcant (bscoring  non-scoring ¼ .252; p ¼ .08). This

suggests that being good at both scoring and non-scoring might actually decrease a player’s chance of being
selected as an All-Star. Scoring (bscoring ¼ .67, p < 0.01) remained positive and signiﬁcant in Model 3; so
was non-scoring (bnon-scoring ¼ .50, p ¼ 0.01).
H3b predicted that vividness would positively mediate the relationship between scoring and All-Star
votes. The hypothesis was supported. Adding vividness in Model 4 signiﬁcantly improved the model: R2
increased to 60.2%; adjusted R2 increased to 50%. Using Kenny et al.’s (1998) approach, I found that (1)
scoring was signiﬁcantly related to All-Star votes (bscoring ¼ .43; p < .0001), (2) vividness was signiﬁcantly
related to All-Star votes (bvividness ¼ .68, p < .0001), (3) scoring was signiﬁcantly related to vividness
(bscoring ¼ .50; p < .0001), and (4) the relationship between scoring and All-Star votes was no longer
signiﬁcant with vividness controlled (bscoring ¼ .12; p ¼ .32). A Sobel test conﬁrmed the full mediation by
vividness on the relationship between scoring and All-Star votes (Z ¼ 3.14; p < .001), but not that between
non-scoring and All-Star votes (Z ¼ .68; p ¼ .49).
Although the results indicated that scoring was a stronger predictor of salaries and All-Star votes than
non-scoring performance, two alternative factors might have inﬂuenced the results. First, scoring might
actually be more important than non-scoring performance, rather than just being vivid. To investigate this
possibility, I conducted an exploratory analysis using the performance data of the 50 All-Star candidate
players in the 2003–2004 season. I ran regression analyses using team performance as the dependent variable
and scoring and non-scoring performances as independent variables. The results indicated that All-Stars’
scoring performance (bscoring ¼ .047, p ¼ .771) did not enhance their teams’ performance more than their
non-scoring performance (bnon-scoring ¼ .33; p ¼ .05) (F (2, 47) ¼ 3.34; p ¼ .04). Surprisingly, the
correlation between scoring performance and their teams’ performance was negative (but not signiﬁcant
r ¼ .216, n.s.). Because All-Star candidates only compose a small portion of all NBA players, this result
might not fully capture the relationship between scoring and team performance. However, previous research
has shown that the winning percentage of NBA teams was determined by both offensive and defensive
statistics, and defensive prowess was critical for teams to win games (Chatterjee et al., 1994; Hoﬂer & Payne,
2004). Thus, the importance of scoring alone was unlikely to explain the current results.
Second, the demand for shooters may be stronger than for defenders: ‘‘Dead-eye shooters are hard to ﬁnd
in today’s NBA’’ (Stein, ESPN, 2006). Thus, it may be demand rather than vividness that drives great
shooters’ salaries. For the same reason, great shooters are likely to outshine great defenders in All-Star votes.
To test this possibility, I compared scoring and non-scoring performances using converted standardized
scores. A comparison of standardized scores between scoring and non-scoring performances, however, did
not support this argument: the shooters in the top 10 (t ¼ 1.36; p ¼ .16), 20 (t ¼ .40, p ¼ .69) and 30
percentiles (t ¼ 1.25, p ¼ .90) had equally good standardized scores as those of the top players at
non-scoring performance. Similarly, comparing the relative standing of scoring with assists, blocks,
rebounds, and steals, suggested that shooters might not be more desperately needed by the NBA teams than
other types of players. In sum, the vividness effect, rather than the importance of scoring to teams or the
demand for great shooters, seemed to be the underlying cause of the relationships reported here.

Discussion
Results in Study 1 showed that vivid scoring performance of NBA players carried more judgmental weight
than the less observable non-scoring performance in both salaries and All-Star votes. Although it appears that
NBA teams included non-scoring in their salary calculations, they overemphasized scoring. NBA fans also
focused on scoring in their evaluation of players. Scoring was the only signiﬁcant predictor of their All-Star
votes, which were cast heavily for great shooters. The interaction between scoring and non-scoring
performances was not signiﬁcant in two regression analyses (bscoring ¼ .024, p ¼ .49.;
bnon-scoring ¼ .25, p ¼ .08.), suggesting that all-around players were unlikely to be considered more
favorably in terms of both salaries and All-Star balloting.

Money and Fame: Vividness Effects

31

The media measure of vividness was signiﬁcantly related to both dependent variables and scoring
performance, but uncorrelated with non-scoring performance. The results of the mediational analyses
indicated that this vividness measure partially accounted for the effect of scoring on salary and fully
accounted for the effect of scoring on All-Star votes.
Study 1 demonstrated a clear and strong vividness effect in the real world as opposed to the lab. Yet,
vividness may correlate with multiple variables in the real life. Although I tried to eliminate as many
unrelated factors as possible, the media measure of vividness might still include unwanted noise. In addition,
archival data alone cannot explain how NBA managers make salary decisions, or how fans vote for All-Stars.
In particular, these data could not directly test whether decision makers fall victim to the inﬂuence of
vividness for the reasons identiﬁed earlier (Nisbett & Ross, 1980) or if more complex factors might be
involved (Taylor & Thompson, 1982). Thus, Study 2 used the NBA context and basketball fans’ cognitive
evaluations of salary and All-Star decisions to directly measure the effects of vividness.

STUDY 2
Study 2 used an online survey to assess basketball fans’ perceptions of NBA players’ scoring and non-scoring
performances. Study 2 primarily investigated the reliability of Study 1’s ﬁndings; it also attempted to explore
the underlying mechanisms behind the vividness effects.

Methods
Participants and procedure
Using both online and on-campus advertisements, I recruited 137 basketball fans from a major Midwestern
university and multiple online sports forums. All participants indicated that they were basketball fans and
liked to watch NBA games. On a seven-point scale, their average liking of NBA games was 5.81 (SD ¼ 1.12).
The survey contained 37 questions on basketball fans’ perceptions of scoring and non-scoring
performances. The ﬁrst set of questions gave the fans ﬁve options (scoring, assisting, rebounding, stealing,
and blocking), and asked them when they watched NBA games, (1) what they looked at ﬁrst; (2) what was
most memorable; (3) what was most eye-catching; and (4) what was most exciting about the game.
A second set of questions examined the vividness of scoring and non-scoring. Like previous research (e.g.,
Wilson et al., 1989), the fans rated eight attributes of scoring and individual facets of non-scoring
performance on seven-point Likert scales (1 ¼ not at all, 7 ¼ very much): ‘‘attention getting,’’ ‘‘interesting,’’
‘‘eye-catching,’’ ‘‘dull,’’ ‘‘exciting,’’ ‘‘boring,’’ ‘‘memorable,’’ and ‘‘impressive.’’
A third set of questions presented three categories of players: shooters, defenders, and all-around players.
The respondents rated, on seven-point Likert scales, how much attention each type of player would receive,
and how valuable each type of player was to the team. Finally, the participants indicated the likelihood that
each type of player would become an All-Star, and how each type of player would be compensated if they
were the general manager of an NBA team.

Results
The ﬁndings of the online survey were consistent with those of Study 1. Scoring was clearly more vivid than
any of the four major non-scoring performance factors in the minds of basketball fans. Table 5 documents
their considerable agreement on the vividness of scoring: 75% reported that they looked at scoring ﬁrst when
watching NBA games; 66% thought that scoring was more memorable than other performance; 47% felt that
scoring was most eye-catching; and 42% found that scoring was the most exciting aspect of performance.

A factor analysis of the eight measures of the vividness of scoring and non-scoring led to one factor
accounting for 49.19% of the variance in scoring, and 55.62% of the variance in non-scoring. The reliability
of the resulting eight items (Cronbach’s a) was 0.85 for scoring; and 0.88 for non-scoring. A paired t-test
showed that scoring (M ¼ 45.51, SD ¼ 6.68) was signiﬁcantly more vivid than non-scoring (M ¼ 41.67;
SD ¼ 8.25) (t ¼ 4.42; p < .01).
A MANOVA assessed the effect of scoring and non-scoring on salaries, using the basketball fans’
responses to the salary questions for each type of player. Results revealed signiﬁcant main effects of player
type on both pay (F (2, 396) ¼ 18.05; p < .001) and perceived contributions (F (2, 396) ¼ 5.69; p < .01).
Follow-up ANOVAS showed that the fans were likely to pay shooters (M ¼ 4.91, SD ¼ 1.21) more than
defenders (M ¼ 4.53, SD ¼ 1.33) ( p < .05) even though they believed that defenders (M ¼ 6.30; SD ¼ 0.85),
rather than shooters (M ¼ 6.01; SD ¼ 0.93), would make more contributions to their teams ( p < .01).
Although the fans would pay all-around players (M ¼ 5.50; SD ¼ 1.41) more than either shooters ( p < .0001)
or defenders ( p < .0001), all-around players were not evaluated more favorably than defenders in terms of
their perceived team contributions (M ¼ 6.36; SD ¼ 0.86) ( p ¼ .57).
The fans also believed that shooters (M ¼ 5.58; SD ¼ 1.08) were more likely to become All-Stars than
defenders (M ¼ 4.46; SD ¼ 1.44) (t ¼ 9.0; p < .001); there was no difference in their perceived likelihood of
selection for shooters and all-around players (M ¼ 5.61; SD ¼ 1.19) (t ¼ .17, p ¼ .86).
Two separate regression analyses also assessed the effects of vividness and perceived value to one’s team
on both salaries and All-Star votes. Vividness was measured by the attention that each type of player received;
perceived value was measured by how valuable each type of player was to his team. The results revealed that
both vividness (bvividness ¼ .32, p < .01), and value to one’s team (bvalue ¼ .14, p ¼ .02), were signiﬁcantly
related to salary (F (2, 336) ¼ 26.802, p < .01), and vividness accounted for more variance (R2 change ¼ .06
adding vividness to value vs. R2 change ¼ .01 adding value to vividness). Vividness had a similar effect on
All-Star votes: the relationship between vividness and All-Star votes was signiﬁcant and positive
(bvividness ¼ .66; p < .01; F (2, 334) ¼ 130.87; p < .01), and fans’ perceived value of each type of player was
not a signiﬁcant predictor of All-Star votes (b ¼ .021, p ¼ .62).

Discussion
The results of Study 2 were consistent with the results of Study 1. Basketball fans perceived scoring as more
vivid than non-scoring. Their responses suggest that scoring will affect both salaries and All-Star votes more
than non-scoring. Even though defenders were perceived as more valuable than shooters, and at least as
valuable as all-around players, these fans reported that they would pay them less and cast fewer votes for them
in All-Star balloting. Vividness was an important underlying factor, and a signiﬁcant predictor of both
salaries and All-Star votes. This suggests that fans may actually de-emphasize the players’ overall value to
the team.
The results of Study 2 were based on general opinions; they did not measure speciﬁc players’ performance.
For the sake of comparison, Study 2’s items arbitrarily categorized players as shooters, defenders, or

all-around players. This categorization may have been inﬂuenced by respondents’ deﬁnitions of the player
types. If the vividness of scoring leads to popularity, they might deem superstars as the shooters or all-around
players and treat the not-so-great players as defenders. These potential biases may have contributed to Study
2’s results. To address this limitation, Study 3 used behavior-based measures to test for vividness effects.
STUDY 3
Study 3 compared the vividness of speciﬁc scoring and non-scoring performances by manipulating the
proﬁles of different types of players. Using behavior-based measures, I tested how vividness affected salary
and All-Star vote decisions, and further investigated some of the mechanisms identiﬁed in Study 2.
Methods
Participants and procedure
Study 3 used two behavior-based online surveys: one for NBA salaries and another for All-Star votes. A total
of 177 and 94 basketball fans responded to the two surveys, respectively. The recruiting procedure and
criteria were identical to those of the second study. All the participants were avid NBA fans (on a seven-point
Likert scale, M ¼ 5.87; SD ¼ 1.19). No one responded to both surveys.
Each survey included the proﬁles of seven hypothetical NBA players who were proﬁcient in different ways
(see Table 6, which was given to participants). For example, Player A in Table 6 was created to be good only
at scoring: his points per game were 1 SD more than the NBA average; all of his other statistics were 1 SD
below the NBA average. Players B, C, D, E, and F stood out on at least two performance statistics, but not
scoring. Player G was created to be an all-around player: all of his performance statistics were around the
NBA mean. The turnovers per game and the total number of games played last season were consistent across
all seven players. The respondents also had access to the means and standard deviations of all performance

statistics in the NBA. In both surveys, the order of presentation of the seven different players was
counterbalanced.
In the salary survey, the respondents saw the following introduction:
Suppose that you are the general manager of an NBA team. Your team decides to sign several new players.
(Players’ basic information is on the following pages.) You need to determine how much your team would
be willing to pay each of them. The pay range is from $500 000 to $5 Million per season. Your total budget
is $10 Million. How will you allocate the pay among these players?
The instructions were followed by the statistics of each player. Right after the respondents entered the
amount they would pay each player, they were asked to indicate on a one to seven scale how impressive they
thought each player was and how great a contribution they expected each player to make to their team. The
participants were then asked to recall, based on the statistics they had just seen, what aspect of each player’s
performance was most important. Players were identiﬁed only by letter, for example, A, B, C. The letters
were randomized. Participants could not go back to the previous pages to review prior information or
answers. Finally, they were also asked which player they would choose if their budget only allowed them to
select one player out of the seven.
The survey about All-Star votes resembled the salary survey, using exactly the same proﬁles, but a
different scenario. The respondents rated on seven-point Likert scales how impressive each of the players was
as a candidate for this year’s All-Star game, how likely they would vote for each player to be an All-Star, and
the contribution they believed that each player would make to his team. The respondents were then asked to
recall the performance criterion that was most important for each player and which player they would support
if they could only vote for one player for the All-Star team.

Results
The results of Study 3 were consistent with the ﬁndings in the ﬁrst two studies. The proﬁle of the shooter was
more vivid to the respondents than those of the defenders. Scoring also had a stronger impact on both salaries
and All-Star votes than non-scoring prowess.
In both surveys, scoring was more vivid than non-scoring. Overall, the shooter (M ¼ 5.18, SD ¼ 1.29) was
perceived as more impressive than all of the other players. The one-way-repeated measures ANOVA tests
contrasting the shooter with each of the other types of players were all signiﬁcant at p < .05. Thus, scoring
was more vivid than non-scoring when basketball fans looked at the statistics of different types of players.
The data also support the effects of vividness on both salaries and All-Star votes. Among the seven players,
the shooter (M ¼ 14.22, SD ¼ 1.11) received the highest salary7 from the basketball fans: the
one-way-repeated measures ANOVA (F (6, 170) ¼ 74.17, p < .01) and pairwise comparisons comparing
the shooter with all other players were all signiﬁcant at p < .01. In addition, the respondents were more likely
to vote for the shooter (M ¼ 4.82, SD ¼ 1.77) than for all of the other players. The one-way-repeated measures
ANOVA tests contrasting the shooter and each other category of player were all signiﬁcant at .05. Taken
together, scoring performance had a larger impact for fans on both salaries and All-Star votes than
non-scoring performance.
The post-experiment questionnaire also revealed that the shooter was the most frequent ﬁrst choice when
respondents could only select one player (all ps  .01 for one sample x2 tests). As seen in Table 7, 40% of the
respondents8 chose the shooter over all of the other six players when they could only sign one player for their
team; 52% voted for the shooter when they could only select one candidate to be an All-Star.

Because accurate recall of the all-around players required respondents to recall more information than for the other types of players, its
accuracy was not comparable to that of other players. Thus, I did not compare all-around player with other players in my analyses.

As in Study 2, two regression analyses compared the effects of vividness and perceived contributions.
Both variables were signiﬁcantly related to salaries (F (2, 1234) ¼ 179.30; p < .0001; bvividness ¼ .30;
p < .0001; bcontribution ¼ .19; p < .0001) and All-Star votes (F (2, 647) ¼ 992.40; p < .0001;
bvividness ¼ .54; p < .0001; bcontribution ¼ .37; p < .0001). However, vividness accounted for more
variance than contributions for both salaries (R2 change ¼ .02 adding vividness to perceived contributions;
p < .01 vs. R2 change < .01 adding perceived contributions to vividness, p < .01) and All-Star votes (R2
change ¼ .10 adding vividness to perceived contributions; p < .01 vs. R2 change ¼ .05 adding perceived
contributions to vividness, p < .01).
The data also seemed to support some of the mechanisms identiﬁed in Study 2. In the salary and All-Star
surveys, 64 and 70.2% of the basketball fans, respectively, correctly recalled that points made per game were
the most important aspect of the performance of the shooter (see Table 7). No other type of performance was
recalled as accurately as the shooter’s performance (all ps  .01 for one sample x2 tests).9 In sum, the results
suggested that fans might process the information about shooters more carefully, and this information stayed
in their memories longer than the information about other types of players.

Discussion
Study 3 corroborated the ﬁndings of the ﬁrst two studies. As predicted, scoring was more vivid than
non-scoring, and it inﬂuenced both salaries and All-Star votes more than non-scoring. Unlike Study 2,
although all-around players were still evaluated more positively than most other types of players, the fans
preferred the shooters over all-around players in both their salary and All-Star decisions. This suggests that
the label of all-around players in Study 2 might also be vivid because the fans perceived them as more similar
to shooters than to defenders. However, when the fans could only look at players’ statistics, they seemed to be
most attentive to scoring, evaluating shooters more favorably than all-around players.
In Study 3, non-scoring performance contained multiple performance dimensions. This may have
accentuated the simplicity, rather than the vividness, of scoring, making shooters stand out. In addition, the
naturally large variance of scoring might also make shooters more attractive than other players. Finally,

despite their consistent results, none of the ﬁrst three studies fully analyzed the relationship among scoring,
non-scoring, winning, and return on investments. Study 4 addressed these issues.

STUDY 4
Study 4 has three major purposes: to replicate the results of Study 3 by breaking down the complexity of
non-scoring performance and minimizing the potential effect of scoring’s large variance; to manipulate the
vividness of defense to test whether manipulated vividness affects fans’ decisions; and to further explore the
opinions of basketball fans to rule out some possible alternative explanations. In particular, Study 4 attempted
to answer the following questions: (1) how would fans compensate different types of players; (2) whether fans
would pay shooters higher salaries as an institutional norm; (3) how fans interpret the relationship between
winning, scoring, and defense; and (4) how they view the relationship between enhancing team performance
and other goals such as attendance and return on investment.

Methods
Participants and procedure
A total of 115 basketball fans were recruited from online basketball forums. They randomly answered one of
two web surveys. No respondent participated in any of the previous studies. On a seven-point scale, their
average liking of NBA games was 5.34 (SD ¼ 1.33).
The ﬁrst survey was similar to Study 3’s. To reduce the potential effect of scoring’s large variance,
however, the survey provided rankings instead of real performance data for each player. The rankings were
carefully chosen to reﬂect both real individual NBA statistics and the performance data used in Study 3. To
simplify the sophistication of non-scoring performance in previous studies, I focused on comparing only
defense and scoring. Thus, I only included three players in the survey: a shooter, a defender, and an all-around
player. Table 8 presents the players and their rankings. The order and identifying letters (A, B, or C) of the
players were counterbalanced using a Latin-square design; the performance categories of each player were
also randomized.
The second survey was identical to the ﬁrst survey except that the defender10 was manipulated to be more
vivid. The manipulation repeated the defender’s rankings, presenting the data again just when fans were

The same manipulation did not seem to work for the all-around player. The overall performance of all-around players might make them
difﬁcult to highlight. But the results of salary comparisons remained the same when I manipulated the vividness of the all-around player.

making their decisions. In addition, the defender was highlighted by the following statement ‘‘Player A (B/C)
is a truly tough defender. He was ranked #45 and #58 in rebounds and blocks among 436 currently active
NBA players.’’ In contrast, the shooter and all-around player were both presented in the same way as in the
ﬁrst survey, without highlighting the players’ data or making any special note of their rankings.
After making their decisions about salary recommendations, the participants answered a series of
questions (see Appendix) on seven-point Likert scales, about their opinions on scoring, defense, player
compensation, and winning. The order of the questions was randomized. Because All-Star players are
typically very highly ranked, Study 4 only tested fans’ salary decisions in both surveys.

Results
The results continued to support the previous ﬁndings. With rankings as information, the shooter still received
higher salaries (M ¼ 14.38; SD ¼ .69) than both the defender (M ¼ 13.94; SD ¼ .78) and the all-around player
(M ¼ 13.66; SD ¼ .89) (F (2, 60) ¼ 22.85, p < .001). This suggests that the variance of shooting did not
account for the results of the previous studies.
The vivid manipulation in the second survey was effective: the fans perceived the defender as more vivid
(M ¼ 4.38, SD ¼ 1.17) with the vivid manipulation than without it (t ¼ 2.81, p < .01). As a result, they
recommended marginally higher salaries to the defender (M ¼ 14.20; SD ¼ .85) than before (t ¼ 1.68,
p < .10). In contrast, however, neither the salaries nor the perceived vividness of the shooter and the
all-around player signiﬁcantly changed (all ps not signiﬁcant). Even though the defender was highlighted, the
shooter (M ¼ 14.57; SD ¼ .73) still received signiﬁcantly more pay (F (1, 51) ¼ 14.76, p < .01). This suggests
that the natural vividness of the shooter is particularly strong. Yet, this might also suggest that shooters may
be paid highly as an institutional norm, just like quarterbacks in football. The fans, however, did not seem to
agree: 70% of them actually believed that the all-around players deserved the highest pay in the NBA, and
85% would pay the all-around players higher salaries if they were an NBA general manager. In contrast, only
3 and 10% of the fans preferred shooters in the same two questions and they did not seem to distinguish
shooters from defenders in terms of hypothetical compensations. Thus, their real salary decisions suggested
that vividness subconsciously reversed fans’ preferences and beliefs.
The fans’ general opinions further supported the vividness of scoring. A direct comparison between
scoring and defense accentuated the vividness of scoring: 82% of the fans reported that they looked at scoring
ﬁrst when watching NBA games; 78% thought that scoring was more memorable than defense; 86% felt that
scoring was more eye-catching than defense; and 86% found that scoring was more exciting than defense.
This suggested that the comprehensiveness of non-scoring performance did not necessarily account for the
vividness of scoring demonstrated earlier.
Two other alternative explanations also bear careful consideration. First, managers and fans might place
more emphasis on scoring because they believe that scoring was more critical to winning or top scorers had
the best athleticism and therefore were rare. However, fans’ responses showed that they were ﬁrm believers of
the old adage that defense was more important than scoring in winning games (t ¼ 4.76, p < .001). In
addition, 93% rated all-around players as most athletically talented and only 15% thought that the NBA was
short of top scorers, far behind both defenders and all-around players.
Second, because scoring is more exciting and entertaining, shooters might be more appealing to fans.
Thus, in paying higher salaries to shooters, NBA managers might actually weigh team performance against
other practical considerations, such as fan attendance and return on investment. Yet, the fans’ post hoc
responses suggested that their decisions rested squarely on enhancing team performance. For them, winning
games was more important to selling seats (t ¼ 3.17, p < .01) and attracting loyal fans (t ¼ 9.76, p < .001)
than scoring or being an entertainingly offensive team. Thus, fans expected that a team would earn more
money when it won games rather than simply enhancing its offensive prowess (t ¼ 6.29, p < .001) or hiring
great shooters (t ¼ 12.47, p < .001). These results suggest that fans placed considerable importance on both

Journal of Behavioral Decision Making

defense and winning. Simultaneously, however, the vividness of scoring seems to have biased their decisions.
This might also explain why the fans agreed that shooters received more attention ( p < .0001) although both
defenders (t ¼ 6.92, p < .001) and all-around shooters (t ¼ 2.75, p < .001) were rated as more valuable to their
teams than shooters.
Finally, the results of Study 4 provided mixed support for the mechanisms of vividness found before. Most
of the fans correctly recalled both the defender and shooter in the end of the survey although in a regression
analysis the reported vividness of each player right after their decision accounted for more variance in salaries
than their perceived contribution (R2 change ¼ .05 adding vividness to perceived contribution; p < .01 vs. R2
change ¼ .02 adding perceived contribution to vividness, p < .01). They also did not differ in their
preferences of different types of players when they were asked to only pick one player.

Discussion
Study 4 ruled out several alternative explanations and consistently supported the previous ﬁndings. Fans
clearly perceived scoring as more vivid than defense although they placed considerable importance on the
latter in terms of winning games. They also would pay shooters more, whether the data were presented in
terms of raw performance data or rankings. Increased vividness also increased the salary of the defender.
This suggests that vividness has an inﬂuential impact on salary decisions. In real life, however, the natural
vividness of scoring seems to be powerful and ingrained. Thus, although enhanced vividness increased the
defender’s salaries, the vividness of scoring still made the shooter the highest paid. These results also
suggest that vividness effects might subconsciously reverse preferences: although fans greatly valued
defense and winning, they actually paid more to shooters, the most vivid, but less valuable players in their
beliefs.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
Using both archival and survey data, this research documented the vividness effect in the NBA. Study 1
demonstrated that scoring was more vivid than non-scoring: scoring performance was more strongly related
to salaries than non-scoring performance and All-Star votes displayed the same pattern. Study 1 also showed
that vividness partially mediated the effect of scoring on salaries, and fully mediated the effect of scoring on
All-Star votes. Study 2’s survey of basketball fans supported the results in Study 1: the fans perceived scoring
as more vivid than non-scoring. Vividness seemed to lead them to recommend paying shooters higher salaries
than defenders even though they believed that defenders would make more contributions to their teams.
Studies 3 and 4 replicated the results of the ﬁrst two studies using behavior-based measures. The results
suggested that scoring was more likely to affect salary recommendations and All-Star votes than non-scoring
because of its vividness.

Theoretical contributions
This research enhances our understanding of vividness effects on judgments and decision making in several
ways. It presents one of the ﬁrst quantitative ﬁeld studies to support the vividness effect. The results suggest
that information competition and differential attention are important conditions for vividness effects (Nisbett
& Ross, 1980). The research also explores some of the important mechanisms of the vividness effect.
The evidence of the vividness effect in a real-world setting responds to Hogarth’s (1981, 2005) concerns
about the generalizability of lab-based decision studies (such as those investigating vividness effects) to
professional and real-world contexts. Taylor and Thompson (1982) noted that information competition and
differential attention were overlooked in the experimental research on vividness. This might be one of the

reasons why there has been a discrepancy between the real-world experience of vividness and laboratory
failures to produce a consistent vividness effect (Taylor & Thompson, 1982, for reviews). The current
research supports this view, suggesting that excessive information and selective cognitive elaboration are
important factors underlying the vividness effect. It also provides some insights into the kinds of situations in
which vividness effects may bias judgment and decision making in the real world. The context for making
judgments and decisions about NBA players’ salaries and All-Star votes is characterized by an abundance of
competing information and seemingly objective and reliable data. The vividness effect occurred in this
context where shooting behavior, though not more important to the team, was over-weighted relative to
defense in decisions about salaries and All-Star votes. This suggests that vividness may bias judgment and
decision making most when a great deal of similarly valid information is available.
Second, the current research suggests that vividness may work subconsciously against one’s expressed
beliefs. Although fans placed considerable importance on defense and winning, they actually recommended
higher salaries for shooters, who they believed to be less valuable to team performance. The inconsistency
between their beliefs and their decisions suggests that the vividness biases their decisions, cognitively and
emotionally, in an undetectable or subconscious way. Both mechanisms were discussed in the classic work on
vividness (Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Taylor & Thompson, 1982). However, the current research provided only
mixed evidence for both mechanisms. Future research might further explore the underlying mechanisms of
vividness and investigate possible ways of reducing its apparently subconscious bias.

Practical implications
The current research also has several practical implications for organizational decision makers. Overall, it
suggests that highly visible behaviors that occur in a context of abundant information are over-rewarded
whereas less visible behaviors that are similarly important are under-rewarded.
This research also provides empirical evidence for Kerr’s (1975) argument that vividness leads to distorted
rewards. More than three decades ago, Kerr noted that vividness was one of the major reasons for distorted
incentives in organizations. However, his argument was more speculative than empirical, and has been
scarcely touched by subsequent research. The current ﬁndings support Kerr’s view, suggesting that
compensation may be subject to biased judgments and inferences because of vividness. This suggests that
organizations might fall victim to the trap of overweighing vivid, but less important performance while
overlooking critical, but less salient performance (Gibbons, 2005; Kerr, 1975). As a result, some vivid, but
less important performance may become very important evaluation criteria. For example, ‘‘face time,’’ that is,
the more hours you work, the better, has been extensively used to measure employees’ performance and some
organizations have even formed a deeply ingrained culture of face time (Munck, 2001). However, it may not
necessarily lead to higher productivity or efﬁciency. Thus, evaluations using face time may be due to its
vividness rather than its importance.
The ﬁndings may also be relevant for reward–performance relationships in teams and groups.
Organizations do not always tie pay closely to performance (Lawler, 1971). The current research suggests
that some team members may be inadequately rewarded not because they are unimportant, but because their
performance is less vivid than that of their teammates. In contrast, employees with high visibility are likely to
be rewarded more than their less visible teammates even though they may not contribute as much to their
groups. This phenomenon may be particularly evident in corporate America, where individual performance is
likely to get more attention than team performance. On the one hand, employees who present themselves well
or even sometimes inﬂate their accomplishments may be over-compensated even though their real
performance may necessarily be more important than their teammates. On the other hand, employees who
work diligently and selﬂessly as team players may be less vivid and thereby take a back seat simply because
they do not visibly ‘‘show up’’ enough.

Finally, this research stimulates some provocative ideas concerning the folly of teamwork in the NBA. The
ﬁndings of this research seem to be inconsistent with common beliefs about the importance and effectiveness
of defense and team play. While most teams rely on teamwork and team chemistry to win games, individual
scoring appears to be most important in determining a player’s value. Defense may not carry as much
weight in NBA teams’ investment decisions even though it is critical for winning games. The popular saying
that a championship is won by defense is widely esteemed and preached in the NBA (Broussard, 2004;
Pippen, 2005). However, the vividness of scoring seems to create more incentives to score than to defend.
Thus, this study raises the question of whether NBA teams may also succumb to the trap of rewarding A while
hoping for B (Kerr, 1975).

Limitations and opportunities for future research
Like all research, these studies have strengths and limitations, which lead to avenues for future research.
Among the strengths and limitations are the method used for the ﬁeld data collection, the large number of
control variables, some different insights provided by each study, and the representativeness of basketball
fans as professional decision makers.
First, one of the strengths of the ﬁeld data in this research is that I more accurately linked NBA players’
contracts to their performance by collecting players’ performance data as of the date they signed their
contracts. Unlike previous studies, which used the salary and performance data from the same year (e.g.,
Harder, 1992), this method should reveal the real performance–salary relationship when teams sign players.
However, since a player’s salary can be related to a complex series of variables over the course of his career,
the current results might be reinforced by longitudinal analyses.
Second, another strength of the model is the number of control variables used to isolate other possible
effects and the preliminary work done to reduce the number of control variables that were redundant.
Multiple analyses were also conducted to make sure that controlling for variables not included in the model
would not make any signiﬁcant change in the results. However, in carrying out similar research in another
setting, serious attention needs to be paid to the choice and non-redundancy of control variables.
Third, these studies provided reasonably consistent evidence for the vividness effect. They were designed to
be complementary to each other to provide some different insights. The results of the four studies, however, were
not always consistent for all-around players. They seem to suggest different insights about how decision makers
treat complex information, such as that of all-around players, and how they process such information relative to
clearer or more vivid information, such as scoring. Thus, future studies might explore how vividness affects the
cognitive evaluations of information with multiple attributes. Furthermore, future research might also investigate
the underlying mechanisms of vividness in the context of more complex information.
Fourth, the web survey studies polled basketball fans rather than the actual decision makers of NBA teams.
The decisions of basketball fans might not reﬂect those of professional sports managers. Because the archival
evidence is consistent with the survey results, however, this suggests similar judgmental biases. The data are
also consistent with prior research on experts and amateurs (Neale & Northcraft, 1986; Northcraft & Neale,
1987), which shows that they are both prone to decision biases. However, the ﬁndings of the current research
could clearly be augmented by surveys of NBA managers or direct observations of their decision making. A
future line of research might also probe how professional decision makers justify their decisions when they
are biased by the vividness effect.
Finally, some competing interpretations of the data are also possible. For example, fan appeal for
shooters may drive up their value because they are likely to attract more loyal audiences, bringing more
economic beneﬁts to their teams. By and large, this research suggests that shooters are more popular than
other NBA players. Since NBA fans focus heavily on scoring, they may overlook defensive skills. Thus,
great shooters are more likely to become superstars than great defenders and all-around players in the eyes
of NBA fans. These superstars can have a substantially positive effect on revenues (Hausman & Leonard,

1997). However, winning games also has great appeal for NBA fans. For example, the Detroit Pistons’
home games, including playoff games, were rarely sold out from the mid-1990s to 2001. But after the team
won the 2004 championship, it not only led all of the other teams in attendance (ESPN NBA Statistics,
2006), but also developed a large fan following for road games (Detroit Pistons, at www.answers.com). A
preliminary analysis using 1-year audience attendance data also suggests that winning games was
positively related to audience attendance.11 Fans’ responses in Study 4 suggest that although NBA teams
are proﬁt driven, NBA managers and fans’ competitive drive and zeal for wins may be heightened as well.
Future researchers might investigate how NBA teams consider different factors to accommodate the needs
of their fans.
In sum, no single study can solve all the design problems that one would like to solve to fully test the
theory in the ﬁeld. The current research does, however, provide reasonably consistent evidence of vividness
in biased rewards and compensations. Its limitations also suggest several important avenues to augment and
supplement existing theory.
CONCLUSIONS
By using both archival and survey data, this research presents strong empirical evidence of vividness in a
real-world setting. It also represents an important extension to the research on vividness. The results suggest
that vividness has important inﬂuences on complex and elaborated decisions. The vividness of certain
components in natural and complex organizational settings seems likely to inﬂuence cognitive evaluations
because such attributes grab more attention and unduly affect information processing (Taylor & Thompson,
1982; Taylor & Wood, 1983). This may lead to biased rewards and compensation in organizations. In
particular, highly visible employees may be over-compensated, while less visible, but equally important
employees may be under-compensated (Kerr, 1975).
Because conditions not typically created in the lab frequently exist in the real world (Taylor & Thompson,
1982), it is hoped that this study will encourage more ﬁeld-based research exploring the cognitive biases and
alternative explanations of the undue impact of vivid information. Finally, weighing information in
proportion to its vividness may induce biased and risky decision making (Nisbett & Ross, 1980). Thus,
another venue of future research might assess how to avoid or reduce the effects of evidentially weak but
highly visible information on judgments and inferences.
