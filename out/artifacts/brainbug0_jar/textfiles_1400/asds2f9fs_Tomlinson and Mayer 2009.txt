THE ROLE OF CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION
DIMENSIONS IN TRUST REPAIR

We examine the repair of one party’s trust in another via repairing trustworthiness
(Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Based on Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory,
we posit that causal attributions (i.e., locus of causality, controllability, and stability)
for the cause of a negative outcome in a trusting relationship explain when trustworthiness is in need of repair and how trustworthiness may be repaired by the trustee’s
efforts. We also discuss the role of specific emotional reactions of the trustor in this
process.

& Taylor, 1991) can offer insights into how trust
grows, declines, and is repaired. Several studies
of trust development have indicated that trust in
another is enhanced to the extent that the other’s trustworthiness can be ascribed to factors
that are internal to the trustee, rather than situationally driven (Kruglanski, 1970; Malhotra &
Murnighan, 2002; Strickland, 1958). Furthermore,
even when managers have to deliver negative
outcomes to subordinates, those subordinates are
less likely to blame their managers (i.e., develop
internal attributions regarding those negative outcomes) when the managers enact trustworthy behavior in the form of communication and concern
(Korsgaard, Brodt, & Whitener, 2002). Other studies
have examined how trust development is affected
by attributional biases (Ferrin & Dirks, 2003), how
attributions are susceptible to self-serving biases
driven by feelings of dependence (Weber, Malhotra, & Murnighan, 2005), and how individuals may
develop sinister attributions regarding others’ motives (Kramer, 1999).
More recently, researchers have begun to apply an attributional perspective to the issue of
trust repair (e.g., Kim, Dirks, Cooper, & Ferrin,
2006; Kim et al., 2004). This research draws on the
schematic model of dispositional attribution
(Reeder & Brewer, 1979) to examine how specific
types of social accounts (e.g., apologies and denials) may be useful in repairing trust, depending on whether the violation concerned matters
of competence or integrity (cf. Mayer, Davis, &
Schoorman, 1995). Ferrin et al. (2007) have called
for more research to understand the attribu-

Since the introduction of trust as a construct of
interest in the behavioral sciences almost fifty
years ago (e.g., Deutsch, 1958), researchers have
established its pivotal role in relationships
within and between organizations (Kramer &
Tyler, 1996; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998). While trust has been widely hailed for its
central role in establishing and maintaining
close, cooperative, and productive relationships
(Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, 2000; Deutsch,
1958; Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Gambetta, 1988), damage to trust through defection and betrayal can
have devastating consequences on relationships (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Robinson, 1996).
Researchers have called for a deeper understanding of the theoretical processes that enable and
facilitate trust repair (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996), with
research only recently beginning to systematically explore this concern (e.g., Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, & Dirks, 2004; Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005;
Schweitzer, Hershey, & Bradlow, 2006). We seek to
facilitate study of this problem by considering
contributions that can be gained from examining
Weiner’s (1986) three causal attribution dimensions in the damage and repair of trust.
Consistent with other researchers (e.g., Ferrin,
Kim, Cooper, & Dirks, 2007; Lewicki & Bunker,
1996), we contend that attribution theories (Fiske

tional processes involved in other types of social
accounts, as well as more substantive actions
designed to repair trust, such as “hostage posting” (Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005).
The purpose of this paper is to further develop
an attributional perspective on trust repair using Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory as
an overarching framework. We use Weiner’s
theory for four reasons. First, Weiner (1986) presents relevant causal attribution dimensions beyond internal versus external locus of causality
that predominates in prior work connecting attribution theory with trust (e.g., Kruglanski, 1970;
Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Strickland, 1958). For
example, Weiner’s theory articulates the stability attribution, which has important effects on
expectations of future behavior and is therefore
likely to be instrumental in trust repair. Second,
Weiner’s theory is applicable to a variety of social accounts (e.g., beyond apology and denial;
Kim et al., 2004) and substantive actions designed to repair trust. Third, in addition to cognitive processes in making attributions, Weiner’s theory explicitly incorporates the role of
emotions, which are relevant in discussing trust
decline and repair (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). Finally, Weiner’s theory has received extensive
research support, including areas conceptually
similar to the current issue of trust repair (e.g.,
Carroll, 1978; Carroll & Payne, 1976, 1977; Folkes,
1984; Takaku, 2001). We will consider several
such studies later in this paper.
To that end, we start by briefly reviewing the
general process of how trust evolves in a relationship. In the second section we use Weiner’s
(1986) causal attribution theory to consider the
process through which trustors react to negative
outcomes. This provides a framework for understanding how broken trust might be repaired by
either altering causal attributions or by attenuating negative emotions after a violation. The
third section provides a specific illustration of
how social accounts relate to these processes. In
the final section we discuss the implications of
causal attribution– based insights and offer directions for future research.
TRUST EVOLUTION: THE BASIS FOR DECLINE
AND REPAIR
Several insightful models that posit how trust
develops within organizations have been proposed (e.g., Butler, 1991; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996;

January

Mayer et al., 1995; Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, &
Werner, 1998). Of these, we chose to use the
Mayer et al. model for our research for several
reasons. It has gained a great deal of acceptance in the literature, although we note that
other models have as well. Unlike some models
positing that feedback affects subsequent trust
directly (e.g., Blau, 1964; Zand, 1972; Zucker,
1986), the Mayer et al. model specifically integrates a feedback loop from outcomes of taking
risks to subsequent perceptions of the trustee.
As detailed below, this feedback loop is compatible with the sensemaking process outlined in
Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory. Mayer
et al.’s feedback loop does little, however, to
explain either the critical process through which
outcomes of taking risks affect subsequent trust or
how to repair it. Thus, this model lends itself well
to the integration of insights that can be derived
from the dimensions of causal attribution. Perhaps most important, the Mayer et al. model specifically delineates a parsimonious but fairly encompassing set of trustee characteristics that
comprise factors the trustor may perceive as causing a negative outcome. As explained below,
these trustworthiness dimensions are possible
causal ascriptions for trust outcomes that are
integral to the application of Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory. While we recognize that, like
any theory, the Mayer et al. model is not without
its critics (e.g., Tinsley, 1996; Wekselberg, 1996),
the feedback loop and the integration of the
trustworthiness factors within the model enable
us to link this model most clearly to the causal
attribution dimensions in Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory.
Mayer et al. define trust as “the willingness of
a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another
party based on the expectation that the other
will perform a particular action important to the
trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or
control that other party” (1995: 712). They propose
that in a relationship with a specific other party,
perceptions of three characteristics of the party—
ability, benevolence, and integrity—will dominate the trustor’s assessment of the party’s
trustworthiness. Perceived ability is the extent
to which the party is deemed to have skills and
competencies in the domain of interest, giving
the party the capacity to contribute to the trustor’s well-being. Perceived benevolence is the
extent to which the party is believed to desire to
do positive things for the trustor. Perceived in-

<-----Page 2----->2009

Tomlinson and Mayer

tegrity means that the party adheres to a set of
values that the trustor finds acceptable. Mayer et
al. propose that a combination of perceived ability, benevolence, and integrity will contribute to
the assessment of the party’s trustworthiness. In
turn, these three factors of trustworthiness will
lead to trust. It is important to note that trust in this
model is separate both from the perceptions of the
trustee and from trusting behaviors. Thus, as we
discuss decline and repair of perceived trustworthiness dimensions, we expect these to lead to
changes in the level of trust itself.
Mayer et al.’s model includes a feedback loop
from the outcome of risk taking back to the trustworthiness factors. These researchers propose
that, after taking a risk with the trustee, the
trustor will observe the outcomes. If the outcomes are positive, prior beliefs about trustworthiness will be reinforced, and trust will either
be maintained or incrementally strengthened. If
the outcomes are negative, some combination of
ability, benevolence, and integrity will be reevaluated and possibly scaled back, leading to
a lowered level of trust. The feedback loop thus
accounts for the evolution of trust over time.
More important for this work, it accounts for
abrupt changes in trust after salient negative
outcomes. In addition, this model suggests that
a decline in trust is preceded by some evidence
justifying a decrease in some aspect of trustworthiness. This leads us to posit that trust can be
repaired by increasing the trustworthiness dimension that declined. Thus, it is ultimately
within this feedback loop that trust repair after a
negative outcome takes place. We define trust
repair as a partial or complete restoration of the
willingness to be vulnerable to the other party
following a decline in that willingness. In the
context of the Mayer et al. model, then, trust
repair is a specific case of the development of
trust via changes in the process represented in
the feedback loop.1
While the Mayer et al. model appears to provide a solid foundation for examining changes

1
It is important to note that while much of our focus on
repair in this paper deals with the process after the trustor
has taken a risk and experienced a negative outcome, our
use of Weiner’s attribution dimensions as a means of understanding trust decline and repair also applies to effects on
the three dimensions of trustworthiness outside the Mayer
et al. feedback loop, such as from information about trustworthiness gained from a credible third party.

in trust over time (e.g., Serva, Fuller, & Mayer,
2005), there has been little explanation of how
the process of updating prior perceptions of
trustworthiness takes place. For example, do all
negative outcomes automatically damage trustworthiness? If trust is damaged, what specific
repair efforts might be effective? We contend
that Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory facilitates understanding the processes that take
place in updating perceptions of trustworthiness, thus offering new insights into how trust is
damaged and repaired. In the following section
we provide a brief overview of Weiner’s (1986)
causal attribution theory and then use it to
explain how causal attribution dimensions operate within the feedback loop following a
negative outcome.
CAUSAL ATTRIBUTION THEORY AND TRUST
REPAIR
In many areas of daily life, including relationships, individuals frequently try to make sense
of the world around them by making attributions
about the causes of events. In turn, these attributions affect the way the individuals feel, their
expectations, and their future behavior. In a theory of this attribution process formulated in an
achievement context, Weiner (1986) contends
that individuals evaluate the extent to which the
outcomes they experience are positive or negative. Similar to Weiner (1986), Mayer et al. (1995)
indicate that individuals pay attention to the
outcomes of their risk taking in a relationship to
update prior trust. Here we are concerned with
the trustor’s perception that a negative outcome
has occurred when the trustor perceives disconfirming evidence regarding his or her beliefs or
expectations.2 This may entail the trustor’s evaluating the degree to which his or her expectations failed to materialize, as well as the severity of the resulting harm he or she has suffered
(cf. Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).
In Weiner’s (1986) theory the perception of a
negative outcome leads to a general emotional
reaction of displeasure, which causes the individual to identify the outcome’s cause (Heider,
1958; Weiner, 1986; Wong & Weiner, 1981). The

scope of this paper.

<-----Page 3----->88

perceived cause is referred to in the attribution
literature as a causal ascription. Weiner suggests that, in an achievement context, typical
causal ascriptions include factors such as ability, effort, luck, and task difficulty. This knowledge is sought so the individual can come to a
deeper understanding of the world and be more
effective in making decisions in the future
(Weiner, 1985).
According to Weiner (1986), after an individual
determines an outcome’s cause (i.e., causal ascription), the individual evaluates that cause
along three primary, continuous attribution dimensions. Locus of causality makes the distinction between causes generated internally (i.e.,
by the trustee) or externally (i.e., by another actor or by the situation: Heider, 1958; Rotter, 1966),
indicating who or what is to blame for the outcome. Controllability refers to the degree of volitional control an individual (e.g., the trustee or
another actor) has over the outcome, or how
much to hold another accountable for the negative outcome. Stability is the degree to which the
cause is perceived to either fluctuate or remain
constant (Jones & Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967); stability thus indicates what to expect in the future
under similar circumstances.
These three attribution dimensions are independent (Rosenbaum, 1972; Weiner, 1986). For
example, suppose you trust a colleague to finish
an important report by a certain deadline so you
can finalize a proposal to a key client, and this
fails to happen. The causal ascription can vary
along all three attribution dimensions. You
could perceive the cause as due to (1) the colleague’s low aptitude (internal, stable, uncontrollable), (2) the colleague’s poor work habits
(internal, stable, controllable), (3) the colleague’s
being sick the day he or she was to work on the
report (internal, unstable, uncontrollable), (4) the
colleague’s not working hard on this particular
report (internal, unstable, controllable), (5) the
report critically depending on data virtually impossible to collect (external, stable, uncontrollable), (6) one source of vital information for the
report being biased against the colleague (external, stable, controllable), (7) bad luck (external, unstable, uncontrollable), or (8) coworkers’/
friends’ failure to provide the colleague vital
assistance on this occasion (external, unstable,
controllable). According to Weiner (1986), results
of this dimensional analysis lead to both future

January

expectations and specific emotional reactions,
which jointly predict subsequent behavior.
Drawing on Weiner’s (1986) theory, we develop
a more detailed analysis of the Mayer et al.
(1995) feedback loop. Specifically, a causal ascription for the negative outcome will be determined. Fortunately, the Mayer et al. model provides a parsimonious, theoretically grounded
set of causes of an individual’s trust-relevant
behavior (ability, benevolence, and integrity).
Recognizing that negative outcomes may arise
in trusting relationships through no fault of the
trustee, we also consider a separate category
(“other”) to account for those possibilities. These
ascriptions in a trusting context are comparable
to ability, effort, luck, and task difficulty that
have been used in an achievement context.
Therefore, we argue that trust declines are due
to perceived decreases in the trustee’s ability,
benevolence, or integrity— often in the wake of a
negative outcome. Accordingly, trust repair involves repairing the damaged factor of trustworthiness. A causal attribution– dimensional analysis of the perceived cause of the negative
outcome (e.g., ability, benevolence, integrity)
provides greater insight into when and how
trust is damaged and, thus, how it can be repaired. As such, the attribution process will focus on understanding the factors that caused
the negative outcome and on predicting whether
the event is likely to recur in order to decide how
much to trust the trustee in the future.
To summarize, Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory sheds light on the Mayer et al. (1995) feedback loop from a negative outcome to rescaling
the trustworthiness factors by suggesting key
trust repair implications based on the causal
attribution– dimensional properties of the various causal ascriptions and the specific emotional reactions generated by these attributions.
These relationships are represented in Figure 1.
As the figure indicates, the feedback loop (from
the Mayer et al. [1995] model of trust) from outcomes to updated evaluations of the trustworthiness factors is explicated by causal ascriptions
and attributions in the cognitive sensemaking
process. Emotional reactions affect the evaluations of trustworthiness and subsequent trust. This
process can be affected by a violator’s attempts to
repair trust, as illustrated in the model.
Below we describe how an attribution-dimensional analysis of each potential causal ascription affects the decline and repair of trustwor-

thiness (and, ultimately, trust). Adapting
Weiner’s framework to a trust context, the trustworthiness factors of ability, benevolence, and integrity are the possible causal ascriptions related
to the trustee. We also include a separate category
to account for causes unrelated to the trustee’s
ability, benevolence, and integrity. It is with this
latter category that we begin our analysis.
Causal Ascription to a Factor Unrelated to
Ability, Benevolence, or Integrity
According to Mayer et al. (1995), after a negative outcome the trustor will reevaluate and
possibly scale back the perceived ability, benevolence, and/or integrity of the trustee. Incorporating Weiner’s (1986) theory to examine
Mayer et al.’s feedback loop suggests that trust
will only decline when an individual has developed some level of trust and then perceives disconfirming evidence due to the causal attributions made for the negative outcome. Thus, not
every negative outcome will cause trust to decline. The trustor may conclude either that an-

other actor or that situational factors caused the
negative outcome. If the causal ascription for a
negative outcome is unrelated to the trustee’s
ability, benevolence, or integrity, the only critical causal attribution dimension to consider
with respect to the relationship with the trustee
is locus of causality. While Weiner’s theory indicates that a trustor will also evaluate the controllability and stability of the cause of the negative outcome, if the cause cannot be at least
partially attributed as internal to the trustee, it
will not affect the trustee’s perceived trustworthiness. Specifically, the trustor will determine
whether the negative outcome is due to internal
(i.e., the trustee) or external (i.e., another actor or
the situation) causes.
If the trustor believes the cause of the outcome
is unrelated to the trustee’s ability, benevolence,
or integrity, the trustor will deem the cause external to the trustee. An external locus indicates
that the trustee had no role in causing the outcome, which precludes any need to impugn the
trustee’s ability, benevolence, or integrity (factors internal to the trustee). Since an external

<-----Page 5----->90

Academy of Management Review

attribution means no aspect of the trustee’s
trustworthiness is called into question, there is
no need to repair trustworthiness. Lewicki and
Bunker (1996) have argued that disconfirmed expectations (i.e., negative outcomes from trust)
are not considered trust violations when situational factors are deemed to be the cause.
Causal Ascription to the Trustee’s Ability,
Benevolence, or Integrity
The trustor may conclude that the cause of the
negative outcome is due to some deficiency in
the trustee’s ability, benevolence, and/or integrity, which the Mayer et al. (1995) model explicitly ascribes to the trustee. Following Weiner
(1986), causal ascriptions to the trustee’s ability,
benevolence, or integrity lead the trustor to evaluate the cause of a negative outcome as an
internal (to the trustee) locus of causality.
Upon deciding that the cause of the negative
outcome was the trustee’s ability, benevolence,
or integrity (i.e., internal to the trustee), the trustor’s attributions regarding the controllability
and stability of the cause also become relevant
in understanding how trustworthiness factors
are updated. We first explain the controllability
and stability dimensions below and then discuss how ability, benevolence, and integrity are
likely to be evaluated along these dimensions.
We use this as a basis to consider how each
trustworthiness factor can be repaired.
The trustor determines if the negative outcome is due to controllable causes. Controllability means that although a cause may emanate
from the trustee (i.e., be internal), the trustee
may not be able to exert control over the outcome. As it becomes increasingly beyond the
trustee’s volitional capacity to alter the negative
outcome, the trustee becomes less culpable, or
blameworthy (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). With increasing trustee controllability for a negative
outcome, however, there may be increasing
damage to trustworthiness. We will elaborate
on this issue when discussing each of the trustworthiness factors.
Trustors also make attributions about the stability dimension to determine if the negative
outcome is due to unchanging circumstances or
to more temporary, unstable causes (Weiner,
1986). Weiner (1986) regards stability, compared
to locus and controllability, as the primary
driver of future expectations, because an out-

January

come due to a permanent cause leads one to
expect the same result in future situations with
similar circumstances, whereas an outcome due
to a temporary cause leads one to expect that
future outcomes may turn out differently. In the
current context of trust repair, if a negative outcome is perceived to be due to a stable cause
(i.e., some aspect of the trustee’s trustworthiness
that is relatively permanent), one may expect a
negative outcome to recur under similar circumstances. This diagnostic information justifies a
downward revision of trust. This is not evident
from an assessment of locus or controllability,
since these dimensions do not consider the permanence of the cause. Researchers have argued
that when a negative outcome is perceived as
an isolated event caused by temporary or fluctuating circumstances, the effect on trust will be
minimized (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993). But when that outcome “is attributed
to an individual’s typical context-specific behavior and there is a perception that similar
violations may recur within the same context,
trust will be disrupted” (Sitkin & Roth, 1993: 371).
One important contribution of this paper
arises from the fact that prior empirical research
on trust using attribution theory has focused
almost exclusively on locus of causality (e.g.,
Korsgaard et al., 2002; Kruglanski, 1970; Malhotra & Murnighan, 2002; Strickland, 1958). Some
prior work has implicitly suggested the importance of controllability (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996)
and stability (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993) but has not extensively explored and
developed these attribution constructs in the
context of trust repair. Weiner’s (1986) stability
attribution is likely to be especially relevant in
the context of trust repair, since it is the key
driver of future expectations in subsequent interactions with the trustee. The stability of the
cause of a negative outcome speaks to whether
the same thing will happen in the future under
similar circumstances, which can be expected to
affect the trustor’s willingness to be vulnerable
to the trustee in the future. Thus, this research
illuminates the importance of considering controllability and stability, in addition to locus, in
understanding trust decline and repair.
The lack of attention in the trust repair literature to Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory is surprising, given its support in empirical studies
conceptually similar to trust repair. These studies foreshadow the relative importance of sta-

<-----Page 6----->2009

Tomlinson and Mayer

bility attributions in this context. For example,
in a study of parole decisions by Carroll (1978)
and Carroll and Payne (1976, 1977), parole decision makers relied heavily on evidence such as
criminal history to assess the stability of the
cause of the crime. An extensively planned
crime was regarded as due to more stable
causes (e.g., a psychopathic personality),
whereas the same crime committed impulsively
and without a prior record was regarded as due
to more unstable causes (e.g., a crime of passion). Convicts were more likely to be paroled
when the cause of their crime was deemed unstable. Releasing a convicted criminal may be
regarded as an act based on trust whereby parole decision makers are being vulnerable to the
possibility of recidivism.
Similarly, consumer reactions to product failure (Folkes, 1984) are heavily influenced by stability attributions that, in turn, drive subsequent
behaviors. When product failure is attributed to
stable factors (e.g., a “bad” company), individuals develop negative future expectations in the
form of future product dissatisfaction, and they
indicate a preference for a monetary refund.
Conversely, a failure attributed to unstable
causes (an anomalous bad shipment of parts) is
associated with positive future expectancies
(product satisfaction), and consumers indicate a
preference for simply exchanging the product
for a replacement. This finding may be reframed
to suggest that consumers are reluctant to trust
a company again after a failure ascribed to stable causes but are willing to trust a company
again when a failure is due to unstable factors.
In sum, after a negative outcome, a trustor will
evaluate the perceived cause. To the extent that
the cause is deemed to be internal, controllable,
and stable, the negative outcome is more likely
to result in lower perceived trustworthiness.
This is consistent with recent work by Weiner on
social transgressions: “Responsibility judgments are particularly likely in instances in
which the cause of a transgression is perceived
to be internal and controllable” (2001: 344). Moreover, since trust is future oriented (Lewicki &
Bunker, 1996), when the cause of a negative outcome is regarded as internal to and controllable
by the trustee and as stable, this is most likely to
result in decreased trustworthiness; the negative
outcome was the trustee’s fault and is likely to
happen again under similar circumstances. Here,
the cause of the negative outcome is not likely to

91

change, so subsequent trust should be lowered or
completely withdrawn (cf. Weiner, 1986).
Having examined the relevance of each of
Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution dimensions,
we now examine how each trustworthiness factor (all of which have an internal locus of control) will likely be evaluated in terms of controllability and stability attributions after a
negative outcome. Based on this analysis, we
then consider how a damaged trustworthiness
factor can be repaired.
Ability. Some types of abilities are considered
to be aptitudes (Mayer et al., 1995) and are therefore not generally considered under volitional
control. Weiner (1986, 2001) cites general cognitive ability, coordination, and artistic aptitude
as examples. Skills and competencies, however,
are abilities that an individual can develop over
time (Mayer et al., 1995) and, therefore, are more
controllable (e.g., an accountant knowing how to
properly file a tax return; Kim et al., 2004). Relatively speaking, if the causal ascription of a
negative outcome is low ability, there may be a
larger decline in trustworthiness when the type
of ability in question is deemed controllable
than when it is not. This is because judgments of
another’s responsibility for a social transgression are deemed to be greater when the cause is
due to a factor under that person’s control (e.g.,
negligence in learning the relevant tax codes)
than to a factor the individual cannot control
(e.g., low quantitative aptitude; Weiner, 1995,
2001). Individuals can exert effort to acquire
skills in areas where they strive to be trusted. If
they choose not to do so, their failure is controllable. This may lead to less favorable assessments of integrity or benevolence.
For example, consider a situation where an
accountant does not file a tax return correctly
(Kim et al., 2004) as due to low ability. One explanation might be that the accountant is ill.
While internal to the trustee, being sick lowers
the ability to perform and is not controllable.
The person’s perceived trustworthiness will decline because he or she will be deemed not able to
perform effectively. Alternatively, the accountant
may be healthy but has not stayed abreast of tax
code changes. While the causal ascription is still
a lack of ability—the accountant does not have the
appropriate tax skills—this reason for the lack of
ability is controllable by the trustee.
In both of these cases, the accountant is
deemed not to have the ability for successful

<-----Page 7----->92

Academy of Management Review

task completion. The reason for this in the
former example is not controllable, whereas in
the latter example it is controllable. In both
cases trustworthiness will decline because of
lower perceived ability. Since in the latter case
the accountant might have chosen to stay more
current with tax code changes but did not, this
may also lead to a reevaluation either of the
accountant’s integrity or benevolence. Thus, the
decline in perceived ability will damage trustworthiness for the accountant in both cases, but
may also damage the perceived integrity (e.g.,
does not reflect expected levels of professional
conduct) or benevolence (e.g., does not care
enough about the trustor’s interests to put in
sufficient effort) of the accountant in the latter
case, causing his or her trustworthiness to drop
more than in the situation where the accountant’s lack of ability was not controllable.
The type of ability ascribed as the cause of a
negative outcome will also be evaluated along
the stability dimension. Ability can be conceptualized in terms of one’s aptitude or in terms of
expertise, skills, and competencies. In addition to
being uncontrollable, aptitude is regarded as a
stable individual difference, whereas individuals
can work to develop expertise, skills, and competencies (Heneman & Judge, 2006). Mayer et al.’s
(1995) construct of ability includes both. In contrast
to aptitude, expertise and skills can be unstable in
the long term. If the trustee gets proper training,
one can expect these types of ability to rise.
The foregoing analysis suggests how the initial causal attribution process leads to damaged
trust. That is, the initial causal ascription (ability of the trustee) and the attributions made on
that basis (degree to which the cause is deemed
to be internal, controllable, and stable) have
implications for updated (i.e., lowered) perceptions of ability and, hence, trust. It is essential to
now consider how the initial postviolation
causal attribution can be revised in a manner
that repairs trust. Initial attributions are not always final, since these can be invalidated or
modified as additional information is received
and processed (Krull, 1993). Gilbert, Pelham, and
Krull (1988) posit that, when reaching attributions, individuals go through a three-stage process where they (1) identify the actor’s behavior,
(2) infer that the actor has a disposition that
corresponds to that behavior, and (3) revise that
inference by adjusting for situational factors.
Whereas the first two processes occur spontane-

January

ously and effortlessly, the latter involves more
mental effort and is engaged in when the observer has the motivation and cognitive resources to do so (Silvera & Laufer, 2005). To the
extent that trust violations are negative, unexpected, and important, their occurrence should
produce high motivation to understand the factors that led to this event (cf. Heider, 1958; Wong
& Weiner, 1981). The response by the offender
often supplies much-wanted additional information in this regard (Bies, 1987; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996), and this information may directly relate to revised attributions (Weiner, 1995). In fact,
an excuse given by the offender (a type of social
account that is examined in more detail later in
the paper) literally connotes a revised attribution (ex ⫽ from and cuse ⫽ cause—i.e., from one
cause to another).
This causal attribution– dimensional analysis
raises several possibilities for various responses of the violator when attempting to repair a damaged assessment of his or her ability.
One possibility is for the trustee to convince the
trustor that his or her ability was not the cause
of the negative outcome and that some external
cause is to blame instead. As explained earlier,
external attributions nullify the need to repair
trustworthiness. Another possibility is for the
trustor to conclude that the specific ability in
question is uncontrollable, although this option
may not fully repair this form of trustworthiness.
For example, if a trustee has low quantitative
aptitude (uncontrollable), one would not be
likely to trust this individual with tasks such as
balancing one’s checkbook, since the cause of
the loss of trust continues. However, a third possibility is for the trustee to convince the trustor
that the form of ability in question is unstable.
Since a complete long-term lack of ability may
preclude the trustee from providing help to the
trustor under any circumstances, it is important
to vindicate perceptions of low ability by persuading the trustor that ability will improve in
the future (i.e., be unstable). In particular, if ability is malleable, this suggests that trust can be
repaired, because the perceived level of ability
that gave rise to initial trust (i.e., before the
negative outcome) is likely to be restored: the
trustee is able to increase his or her ability.
Whereas a stable form of ability like IQ provides
little opportunity for repair, an unstable form
has possibilities for improvement.

Tomlinson and Mayer

Proposition 1: Damaged perceptions of
ability can be repaired by demonstrating that the cause of the negative outcome was due to (a) an external factor,
(b) a more uncontrollable form of ability, and/or (c) a more unstable form of
ability.
Benevolence. If the causal ascription for the
negative outcome is low benevolence, this is
likely to be regarded as controllable by the
trustee. In the Mayer et al. model, benevolence
is a positive orientation of the trustee specific to
the trustor. This orientation can manifest itself
by such behaviors as taking risks or making
sacrifices for the benefit of the trustor. This is a
quality that the trustee can consciously and intentionally affect by engaging in behaviors
helpful to or protective of the trustor. Mayer et al.
contend that the trustee’s motivation to lie (Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953) is inversely related to
benevolence; lying and similar behaviors are
controllable.
Benevolence will also be evaluated in terms
of the stability dimension. Mayer and colleagues (Mayer et al., 1995; Schoorman, Mayer, &
Davis, 2007) contend that, relative to ability and
integrity, perceptions of benevolence will increase more slowly as the relationship between
the parties develops over time. Deeper, stronger
relationships may lead the trustor to a highly
stable attribution regarding the trustee’s benevolence— even to the point that the trustor refuses to believe evidence of the trustee’s malfeasance that would be sufficient to convince
objective third parties (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).
Similarly, once perceptions of the trustee’s low
benevolence are in place, they are likely to produce a very stable attribution (Kramer, 1999).
While a perception of benevolence becomes
stable as the relationship develops over time,
early in the relationship it is less so (Mayer et
al., 1995). Without a history of demonstrated benevolence from the trustee, positive or negative
interactions are likely to take on greater significance for the trustor. A given act that appears to
indicate either high or low benevolence tends to
stand alone as input, rather than being taken in
the context of everything that has happened between the parties. Thus, while benevolence is
likely to be perceived as stable in an established relationship, it is unstable early in a relationship.

93

As with ability, there is some capacity for the
quality of the relationship between the parties
to evolve. Even in an established relationship,
neglect of the other party can damage the perception of benevolence over time. In sum, then,
benevolence is internal to the trustee, is controllable, and is relatively stable in an established
relationship but is unstable in a new one.
This causal attribution– dimensional analysis
raises several possibilities for repairing trust
caused by damaged benevolence. The trustee
could convince the trustor that low benevolence
was not the outcome’s cause but, rather, that the
cause was external to the trustee. Alternatively,
the trustee could attempt to persuade the trustor
that the cause was due to a type of inability that
is less stable than benevolence at that point in
the relationship. For example, a scenario study
by Elangovan, Auer-Rizzi, and Szabo (2007) manipulated whether a trust violation was attributed to the trustee’s being either unable (i.e., low
ability) or unwilling (i.e., low benevolence) to
meet expectations. They found that trust eroded
more rapidly when trustees were seen as unwilling to honor trust. Another possibility is for
the trustor to be persuaded that this instance of
low benevolence was an isolated or obsolete
circumstance (i.e., unstable). To the extent that
the trustor sees the trustee as having a “change
of heart” and desires to do good in the future,
damage resulting in lower benevolence may be
repaired. Cold and bitter relationships can
warm and sweeten (usually over time and with
repeated work; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996).
Proposition 2: Damaged benevolence
can be repaired by demonstrating that
the cause of the negative outcome was
due to (a) an external factor, (b) a more
unstable form of ability, or (c) an incident of low benevolence that is unstable.
Integrity. If the negative outcome’s cause is
perceived to be low integrity (i.e., the trustee
does not adhere to a set of principles that the
trustor finds acceptable), this is likely to be seen
as controllable by the trustee. Weiner (1986) contends that individual characteristics such as laziness and industriousness are generally perceived as personally controllable. These
characteristics also seem to describe the extent
to which one would be considered to have integrity by the Mayer et al. (1995) definition. Along

<-----Page 9----->94

Academy of Management Review

these lines, Kim et al. (2004) used as an example
of low integrity an accountant who files an incorrect tax return intentionally. This behavior is
likely to be perceived as controllable—as chosen by the accountant. Mayer et al. cite factors
such as adherence to principles of fairness and
following through on commitments as affecting
perceptions of integrity. Indeed, trustees are often regarded as able to control the extent to
which they demonstrate integrity in these ways.
Consider, for example, theories that address
when individuals are deemed to have violated
fairness when they could have chosen to behave
fairly instead (fairness theory; Folger & Cropanzano, 2001), or failed to follow through on their
promises and commitments (behavioral integrity theory; Simons, 2002).
The trustee’s integrity is also likely to be regarded as stable, particularly when the evaluation is that integrity is low. Individuals found to
be dishonest on one occasion are more likely to
be deemed dishonest in general (Kim et al.,
2004). Trafimow, Bromgard, Finlay, and Ketelaar
(2005) describe an analysis by Kant (1991/1797) to
consider why behaviors that reflect low integrity
may carry strong signaling value about the person. Kant differentiated between perfect and imperfect duties in the moral arena. Perfect duties,
he argued, must be performed at all times and
do not allow for situational exceptions, whereas
exceptions are allowed with imperfect duties
under some circumstances. As an example,
Trafimow et al. state that telling a beggar a lie
that one has no money is a violation of a perfect
duty (one should never lie), whereas refusing to
give money to the beggar only violates an imperfect duty of charity. Kant asserted that violation of a perfect duty carries more information
about the moral status of the person as an enduring quality. Indeed, many organizations rely
heavily on paper-and-pencil integrity tests as a
selection tool for applicants, because indications of past dishonesty can predict a variety of
counterproductive work-related behaviors
(Sackett, 1994). It is well accepted that convicted
felons have difficulty securing employment, apparently owing to ascriptions of low integrity
and an associated assumption of its stability.
This analysis shows there is a distinction between integrity and the other two trustworthiness factors. While some types of ability are
stable (e.g., physical coordination, general intelligence), many ability issues can be developed

January

with training or experience. Benevolence is
likely to be perceived as stable in a welldeveloped relationship, but it is unstable in a
newer relationship and can also develop over
time. Thus, to understand trust repair, it is important to note that integrity appears to be the
most stable factor of trustworthiness. We note
that while both benevolence in a well-established relationship and integrity are relatively
stable, accumulating disconfirming evidence or
the occurrence of a “frame-breaking” event can
change one of these evaluations (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Robinson, Dirks, & Ozcelik, 2004). For
example, the perception of integrity of a previously respected CFO would be severely damaged by the discovery that the executive embezzled. Nevertheless, these assessments are seen
as generally stable in the literature.
We draw again on this causal attribution–
dimensional analysis to understand how to repair damaged trustworthiness in terms of low
integrity. Since it is likely to be the most stable,
an ascription of low integrity as the cause of a
negative outcome is likely to be most resistant
to repair. Because of its stability, a causal ascription of low integrity leads a trustor to believe that future risk taking with the trustee is
likely to lead to more negative outcomes. With
this in mind, there are few possibilities for repairing damaged integrity. Essentially, it is
likely that the best way to repair low integrity is
for the trustee to attempt to reattribute the cause
to a less damaging causal ascription, such as an
external cause, or to ability. For example, Kim et
al. (2004) found that denials were superior to
apologies in repairing damaged trust due to an
integrity violation. As we will explore later, denials attempt to shift the attribution from being
internal to external.
Proposition 3: Damaged perceptions of
integrity can be repaired by demonstrating that the cause of the negative
outcome was due to (a) an external
cause or (b) a less stable internal
cause.
Since we are concerned with trust repair in
this paper, we focus on revised causal attributions after initial causal attributions have already been reached by the trustor (i.e., initial
causal analysis has led to a decline in trust). Of
course, social accounts and other substantive
attempts to mitigate damage to trust may be

<-----Page 10----->2009

Tomlinson and Mayer

undertaken more proactively by the violator, potentially precluding the perception of a negative
outcome altogether. However, this issue does
not deal with trust repair and is therefore not a
focus of our research here.
Specific Emotional Reactions
So far, we have focused on the role of cognition in considering the dimensions of causal
attributions in the decline and repair of trust.
However, a number of researchers have argued
that emotions are also a critical consideration in
understanding how trust changes. For example,
Williams has asserted that “affective responses
(e.g., anger, disappointment, joy) influence how
people evaluate their feelings for, attachment
to, and trust in others” (2001: 379). Jones and
George have argued that “moods and emotions . . . contribute to the ongoing experience
of trust, providing people with signals concerning the changing nature of their ongoing experience of trust” (1998: 534). Dunn and Schweitzer
(2005) found that negative emotions affect trust
evaluations even when the negative emotions’
source is distinct from the evaluation target.
Furthermore, those who experience a decline
in trust in another often experience an adverse
emotional reaction resulting in a sense of violation, particularly when the offender’s actions are
perceived as freely chosen (Lewicki & Bunker,
1996). In the closely related area of psychological contracts, Morrison and Robinson (1997) distinguish a breach, or a cognition that the organization has not fulfilled its obligations, from a
violation, which is an adverse emotional reaction to the breach. It is thus necessary to examine the negative emotions that result from the
causal attributions made for a negative outcome
(cf. Lewis & Weigert, 1985; Morrison & Robinson,
1997). As described earlier, a negative outcome
elicits general emotional displeasure, which initiates a sensemaking process that yields causal
ascriptions and causal attributions. As we examine in this section, specific emotional reactions (i.e., anger, fear) arise depending on the
causal attributions made. These emotions,
along with causal attributions, affect both subsequent trust and trustworthiness. We turn now
to a more detailed consideration of this process.
How specific emotional reactions affect subsequent trust. Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory
holds that the trustor’s causal analysis along

95

locus, controllability, and stability dimensions
gives rise to specific emotional reactions, an
assertion that has been supported empirically
(Rudolph, Roesch, Greitemeyer, & Weiner, 2004;
Weiner, Amirkhan, Folkes, & Verette, 1987;
Weiner, Russell, & Lerman, 1979). Thus, if after
the negative outcome the trustor’s attribution
process concludes that the cause is internal and
controllable and/or stable, the trustor is likely to
feel violated and to experience specific negative
emotions.
In the current context, controllability attributions for a negative outcome are associated with
anger, which Lewicki and Bunker (1996) cite as a
key emotional response to a trust violation. Specifically, Weiner discusses anger toward another as arising from “an ascription of a negative, self-related outcome or event to factors
controllable by others” (1985: 562). It is worth
noting that one’s trust in another might decline
because of a factor beyond the trustee’s control
(e.g., an employee with low mathematical aptitude may not be trusted anymore on heavily
quantitative tasks), yet this would not be likely
to produce a sense of “violation” (i.e., strong
negative emotions). At the heart of the matter is
whether or not the violated party believes that
whatever loss or suffering arises from the negative outcome was somebody’s fault and might
have been averted by that party. Because anger
arises from the cognition that a trustee is to
blame for a negative outcome he or she could
have controlled but chose not to (Barclay, Skarlicki, & Pugh, 2005; Tangney & Dearing, 2002;
Tavris, 1982), it incites the injured person to undertake self-protective actions with respect to
the trustee (Weiner, 2001). Stated differently, the
trustor’s anger will lead to reduced willingness
to be vulnerable to the trustee. Based on this, we
posit that anger toward the trustee should be
negatively related to subsequent trust, and,
thus, actions that reduce such anger should contribute to repairing trust.
Mowrer (1960) describes fear as the continued
anticipation of a negative reinforcer. Stability
attributions for a negative outcome result in fear
(Mowrer, 1960; Weiner, 1986), since stability suggests that the circumstances that gave rise to
the negative outcome will occur again. Thus,
Weiner argues, “In attributional language . . . fear
should arise given failure [negative outcome]
and an attribution to a stable cause” (1986: 154).
Research has established that stability attribu-

<-----Page 11----->96

Academy of Management Review

tions for negative outcomes are also associated
with hopelessness and resignation (Weiner,
Russell, & Lerman, 1978, 1979). Given a stable
cause (e.g., the trustee is deemed a dishonest
person) for a negative event, the future is forecasted to look as bad as the past, causing one to
feel fearful regarding future interactions with
the other and to take protective action (cf.
Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998). Conversely, if
the attribution is to an unstable cause (e.g., a
single temporary episode; Lewicki & Bunker,
1996), then a future negative outcome is less
certain, and so less fear may be expected. When
evaluating how much to trust, out of selfprotection, fear will lead an individual to more
conservative estimates of the willingness to
be vulnerable to that party. Conversely, then,
reduction or elimination of fear of the trustee
should increase the willingness to be vulnerable (i.e., trust) to the trustee again.
How specific emotional reactions affect trustworthiness. In addition to affecting trust directly,
we contend that specific emotional reactions affect how a trustor processes information about a
trustee—that is, trustworthiness. Much prior work
has focused on cognitive aspects of evaluating
trustworthiness, but we note that this processing
does not occur in a sterile environment. Thus,
while causal attributions result in specific emotional reactions, those emotional reactions can be
expected to affect further cognitive processing.
Citing others in the psychology literature, Jones
and George conclude that “one’s current affective
state may color one’s experience of trust and, thus,
the way a person forms opinions and makes judgments about the trustworthiness of others” (1998:
534; emphasis added). Similarly, Williams (2001)
suggests that affect influences how people evaluate others’ trustworthiness. Thus, a sense of violation can adversely affect the cognitive process by
which one evaluates information about a trustee’s
ability, benevolence, and integrity. As Jones and
George put it, “Negative moods and emotions may
add a negative tone to interactions and may result
in an individual perceiving others as less trustworthy than they actually are” (1998: 534).
Researchers (Jones & George, 1998; Williams,
2001) have shown that emotions affect the judgment process, which suggests that, like trust,
perceptions of trustworthiness will be influenced by emotions. Since emotions affect what
information the trustor attends to and how it is
evaluated, they affect trust repair. Strong emo-

January

tions can lead to ignoring or rationalizing away
new information about ability, benevolence, or
integrity that an outside observer might view as
positive developments in these dimensions.
Summary. The literature reviewed above suggests that emotions provide a psychological
context in which judgments about trustworthiness and trust are made. This context affects the
decisions individuals make about trust (Dunn &
Schweitzer, 2005; Jones & George, 1998; Williams, 2001). Based on Weiner’s (1986) theory, we
considered two specific emotional reactions that
are generated by specific causal attributions for
a negative outcome. We reviewed how attributions give rise to these emotions. Negative emotions can inhibit or prevent the repair of trust
either through evolution or point-in-time interventions by the trustee, since they affect how
new information about the trustee is processed
in updating both trustworthiness and trust.
Based on this, we suggest that effective trust
repair may necessitate not only managing cognitions but also emotions such that reducing
anger and fear may enable higher perceived
levels of trustworthiness and trust.
In this regard, recent papers have defined forgiveness, which is not to be confused with reconciliation (Freedman, 1998; Tomlinson, Dineen, &
Lewicki, 2004), in terms of the victim’s resolving
negative emotions toward the offender after a violation (Aquino, Grover, Goldman, & Folger, 2003).
Forgiveness can be facilitated by the transgressor’s use of accounts and/or penance. Whatever
takes away the negative emotions allows for rational processing of new information. At that point
trust can be repaired, because the victim can think
about the ascriptions and attributions rationally,
without letting emotions cloud the process. Research in the area of emotions is likely to be fruitful in giving us a better understanding of what
actions by a violating party are likely to initiate
the dissolution of negative emotions.
Proposition 4: Trust and trustworthiness
will be repaired more effectively if anger and fear are reduced prior to or concurrently with the repair attempt.
Thus far, we have used Weiner’s (1986) theory
to examine when a negative outcome will lead
to a decline in trustworthiness. We reviewed
four causal ascriptions and examined the relevant causal attribution dimensions for each one.
We also considered the role of specific emotional

<-----Page 12----->2009

Tomlinson and Mayer

reactions in this process. This analysis provides
deeper insight into the initial attributions after a
negative outcome has led to a decline in trust, as
well as some general insight into how those initial
attributions might be subsequently revised by the
violator in order to repair trust. Interestingly, much
of the prior research on trust repair has examined
the efficacy of social accounts from the violator,
and we believe this offers a very fruitful foundation for illustrating the specific attributional
mechanisms involved in repairing damaged trustworthiness.
HOW SOCIAL ACCOUNTS CAN MANAGE
ATTRIBUTIONS
Given that the focus of this paper is on trust
repair, it is important to recall that initial judgments of the trustee’s trustworthiness after a
negative outcome are not always final—specific
attributions can be invalidated or modified as
additional information is received (Krull, 1993;
Weiner, 1985). Most of the prior research on the
dynamics of trust repair has examined the efficacy of certain types of social accounts from the
trustee after trust has been damaged (Kim et al.,
2004, 2006; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Schweitzer et
al., 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2004). Social accounts
are one type of reparative effort by the trustee
(Scott & Lyman, 1968; Tomlinson et al., 2004). We
contend that these accounts are effective because they revise damaged attributions after a
negative outcome.
Specifically, we draw from Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory to suggest how social accounts
might modify causal attributions to repair trust
after a negative outcome. It is important to note
here that the attributional analysis developed in
this paper is applicable beyond understanding
the effect of social accounts on trust repair. It can
be applied as well to understand and predict the
effectiveness of substantive actions, such as penance or hostage posting. Given space limitations
and the fact that social accounts have been used
in recent literature to study attempts at trust repair, we focus on them as a vehicle to demonstrate
the insights that can be gained from the current
attributional analysis.
Social psychologists have developed a vast
body of literature on how individuals attempt to
manage the impressions they make on others.
Indeed, in interpersonal relationships actors often engage in actions to “influence the defini-

97

tion of the situation which [the observer] come[s]
to have” (Goffman, 1959: 6). A significant portion
of work on this subject deals with social accounts, or the ways in which individuals attempt
to shape the perceptions of others following a
negative event (e.g., Cody & McLaughlin, 1990;
Goffman, 1971; Schlenker, 1980). When an individual has harmed another, potentially threatening responses from the violated party may
result (e.g., a damaged reputation, reduced cooperation, retaliation), thus creating a predicament for the offender. The offender can respond
with “a social account that attempts to correct
the audience’s initial perceptions of the situation” (Bies, 1987: 295; emphasis added).
The seminal work by Scott and Lyman refers
to accounts as devices that provide a context for
apparently negative behavior in an effort to
“verbally bridge the gap between action and
expectation” (1968: 46). Much work has examined
the use of accounts in the context of promoting a
sense of justice (Bies, 1987; Bobocel & Zdaniuk,
2003; Greenberg, 1990). Providing adequate and
sincere explanations for negative events is associated with more favorable reactions (e.g.,
higher fairness perceptions, lower anger and
resentment) than when events are either not explained or explained inadequately (Bies & Shapiro, 1987; Shapiro, 1991). Given that accounts
can mitigate the detrimental effects of negative
behavior, it makes sense to understand the attribution mechanisms through which they work.
This provides a basis for understanding and
predicting which type of account is likely to be
most effective in repairing trust under which
particular circumstances.
Verbal communication by the offender frames
and shapes the victim’s interpretation of the
trust violation (Goffman, 1971), assisting the victim in cognitive sensemaking (Heider, 1958) and
shaping his or her perceptions of the offender’s
intentions and relevant contextual information
(Mehlman & Snyder, 1985; Tedeschi & Riess,
1981; Weiner et al., 1987) by providing information that would otherwise be unavailable. Prior
research has established that exonerating accounts for a negative outcome tend to be those
that assert that the cause has an external locus
to the offender, is uncontrollable by the offender,
and/or is due to an unstable (i.e., unlikely to
recur) cause (Weiner et al., 1987; Weiner,
Figueroa-Muñoz, & Kakihara, 1991).

<-----Page 13----->98

Academy of Management Review

This analysis allows us to consider how various types of social accounts may affect certain
causal attributions about the cause of a negative outcome, which ultimately determine the
success of a repair attempt. Scholars (Bies, 1987;
Cody & McLaughlin, 1990; Greenberg, 1990) have
provided useful typologies of social accounts
that individuals use when they are in a social
predicament and wish to mend their spoiled identity. Weiner (1995) examined how social accounts
may affect the receiver’s causal attributions for an
event. We consider four types of social accounts—
denial, excuse, apology, and justification (Cody &
McLaughlin, 1990)—and then propose how trustworthiness and trust can be repaired based on
how the use of each of these accounts attempts to
modify specific attribution dimensions and specific emotional reactions.
Accounts and Causal Attributions
In a denial, a trustee claims to not be responsible for the negative outcome because he or she
was not the perpetrator and therefore should not
be held accountable (Bies, 1987; Cody &
McLaughlin, 1990; Tedeschi & Norman, 1985).
Through a denial, a trustee may attempt to shift
blame elsewhere (Crant & Bateman, 1993), and
may even provide proof of innocence (Cody &
McLaughlin, 1990). Denials declare that the
cause of the negative outcome is external to the
trustee (Weiner, 1986; Weiner et al., 1987; Weiner
et al., 1991). As discussed earlier, external attributions for negative outcomes do not damage
trustworthiness, since the negative outcome is
not deemed to be due to broken trust. A denial
asserts that the trustee’s ability, benevolence,
and integrity are intact and should not be impugned.
Proposition 5: Denials that reduce internal attributions will repair trustworthiness.
An excuse also attempts to minimize one’s
responsibility for negative events (Bies, 1987).
The trustee asks not to be held accountable,
claiming that mitigating circumstances attenuate his or her culpability (Cody & McLaughlin,
1990). Unlike a denial, the trustee admits a role
in the negative outcome but contends that he or
she is not fully responsible (Scott & Lyman,
1968). With respect to locus of causality, Snyder
and Higgins (1988) describe excuses as shifting

January

causal attributions for negative outcomes from
sources that are central to the person to sources
less central. Weiner et al. (1987) found that good,
exonerating excuses also communicate causes
for a negative outcome that are uncontrollable
by the excuse giver. Furthermore, Weiner et al.
(1991) concluded that exonerating excuses may
communicate unstable causes, such as “I forgot
the appointment.” Claiming a temporary lapse
in memory indicates that this is not a permanent
state of affairs, and such excuses aim to
“change the other person’s beliefs that ‘the same
thing might happen again in the future’”
(Weiner et al., 1991: 10).
An excuse thus alters attributions such that
the negative outcome’s cause is seen as more
external, uncontrollable, and/or unstable
(Weiner, 1992), which should lead to repaired
trustworthiness. As developed earlier in the paper, external attributions signal that the trustee’s ability, benevolence, and integrity are intact. Uncontrollable attributions attenuate
culpability for a negative outcome, which reduces the negative effect on trustworthiness.
Unstable attributions signal that the negative
outcome’s cause is not some permanent aspect
of trustworthiness.
Proposition 6: Excuses that reduce internal attributions, controllability attributions, and/or stability attributions
will repair trustworthiness.
Apologies attempt to reframe the account
giver (Bies, 1987; Cody & McLaughlin, 1990) after
a negative outcome. They are confessions of responsibility, normally accompanied by an expression of remorse for the harm inflicted (Tedeschi & Norman, 1985). Goffman (1971) claims that
an apology admits one is responsible for a
transgression but has learned a valuable lesson
never to repeat the offense. Accordingly, apologies explicitly acknowledge that the negative
outcome is internal and controllable but frame
the cause of that negative outcome as unstable
(i.e., unlikely to recur because the negative outcome was caused by one who has reformed and
renounced untrustworthy behavior). Several
studies have supported the efficacy of apologies
in restoring trust or cooperation after a violation
under certain circumstances (Bottom, Gibson,
Daniels, & Murnighan, 2002; Kim et al., 2004,
2006; Tomlinson et al., 2004).

<-----Page 14----->2009

Tomlinson and Mayer

A relevant application of Weiner’s (1986) theory deals with forgiveness of transgressions in
relationships (Gold & Weiner, 2000; Takaku,
2001; Takaku, Weiner, & Ohbuchi, 2001). A summary of this work indicates that remorseful
apologies attempt to convey to the victim of a
transgression that the cause of the transgression was unstable. In other words, a dispositionally “good” person did an uncharacteristically
“bad” thing that will not recur. Therefore, apologies convey that there is not enduring damage
to the trustee’s trustworthiness.
Proposition 7: Apologies that reduce
stability attributions will repair trustworthiness.
Finally, instead of lessening their responsibility, individuals may accept responsibility while
attempting to reframe their behavior as in accordance with some type of superordinate goal
or value, or by providing a more positive interpretation of the negative outcome (Cody &
McLaughlin, 1990; Tedeschi & Norman, 1985; Tedeschi & Riess, 1981). This type of account provides a justification (Cody & McLaughlin, 1990)
for behavior that is initially perceived negatively by pointing to reasons that it is legitimate
and consistent with moral values. As such, this
account “serves the purpose of making the action seem less negative (or even positive)” (Cody
& McLaughlin, 1990: 230). Interestingly, this
would likely reverse the desired attributions
such that the outcome will be viewed as internal
to the trustee, controllable, and stable. Such attributions for a (newly regarded) favorable outcome should repair trustworthiness. That is, an
outcome that becomes positive enhances trustworthiness to the extent that it is internal to and
controllable by the trustee and a stable aspect
of his or her trustworthiness.
Proposition 8: Justifications that reduce the perceived negativity of the
outcome will repair trustworthiness.
In summary, causal attributions mediate the
relationship between social accounts and trust
repair.

tions described earlier, we suggest that the
effectiveness of attempts to repair trust might be
attenuated by negative emotions that arise from
a trust violation. Thus, although much of the
focus of our attention in this paper has been on
the cognitive processing considered in attribution theory, research on how to manage the emotions that arise from a trust violation is clearly
warranted for a fuller understanding of how to
repair trust. Without it, a trustee who has damaged trust might make positive moves to repair
trust only to find his or her efforts voided by
unmanaged emotions.
If social accounts lead to revised attributions,
this should also alter the specific emotional reactions of anger and fear. For example, an excuse that the negative outcome was uncontrollable should mitigate anger (Weiner, 1986, 2001).
Extensive apologies have been shown to lower
anger (Ohbuchi, Kameda, & Agarie, 1989), but
they should also reduce fear due to lower stability attributions (Weiner, 1986). Accordingly,
Proposition 4 states that a reduction in anger
and fear will allow for more effective repair of
trustworthiness and trust.
Summary
This attributional analysis indicates that
there are several routes to trustworthiness repair through the use of social accounts. Denials
attempt to shift attributions from being internal
to the trustee to being external. Excuses attempt
to facilitate external, uncontrollable, and/or unstable attributions for the cause of the negative
outcome. Denials and excuses pointing to external/uncontrollable reasons repair trustworthiness in the sense that they render a decline in
trustworthiness inappropriate. Apologies attempt to repair trustworthiness by asserting that
the cause of the negative outcome is unstable
and, hence, unlikely to recur. Justifications attempt to repair trustworthiness by reducing the
perceived negativity of the outcome.
DISCUSSION OF THE THEORETICAL
FRAMEWORK
In this paper we seek to answer calls for work
on attribution processes explaining a broader
array of trust repair attempts with a model of
how trust is updated after a negative outcome
based on Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory. Our

<-----Page 15----->100

Academy of Management Review

framework uses Weiner’s theory to specify relevant causal attribution dimensions and specific
emotional reactions that affect subsequent trust
after a negative outcome in the Mayer et al.
(1995) model. We contend that there are several
contributions that can be gained from this analysis that build a solid foundation for effective
trust repair.
Prior work has extensively relied on locus of
causality, but the roles of Weiner’s (1986) controllability and stability dimensions in understanding trust decline and repair have not been developed. Furthermore, stability appears to be
particularly relevant and critical to trust repair,
since it is the key attributional driver of future
expectations (Weiner, 1986). In order to trust
again, the trustor’s central concern revolves
around the prediction of how likely a future similar violation will be (Tomlinson et al., 2004).
The use of Weiner’s (1986) attribution theory
also facilitates analysis of negative outcomes
beyond causes due to the trustee’s competence
and integrity (Kim et al., 2004, 2006) to a consideration of how benevolence and factors external
to the trustee come into play. This framework
can also account for other forms of social accounts beyond apology and denial, as well as
substantive reparative efforts (Ferrin et al.,
2007). For example, substantive penance (Bottom
et al., 2002) and hostage posting (Nakayachi &
Watabe, 2005) are actions (instead of accounts)
that likely convey that the cause of the negative
outcome is unstable. Penance is a tangible symbol of remorse from a reformed transgressor.
Similarly, a trustee who uses hostage posting
voluntarily agrees to sacrifice collateral if he or
she betrays trust in a future interaction. These
examples suggest that causal stability mediates the relationship between the substantive
repair efforts and repaired trustworthiness.
By developing a deeper understanding of why
different means of repair will be effective under
what conditions, our research enhances scholars’ understanding of these complexities. For
example, while Kim et al. found apologies effective for repairing trust attributed to an unstable
ability attribution (i.e., knowledge of tax codes),
this paper suggests that the same result may not
be true if the violation is attributed to a more
stable ability violation, such as a lack of sufficient intelligence to understand the task complexities. The current research provides not only

January

a deeper understanding of prior results but a
framework for insightful future research.
For example, if an outcome is unambiguously
negative and is due to the trustee’s volition, it is
unlikely that denials or justifications will be
effective. Furthermore, recent research has suggested that providing external and uncontrollable accounts is not exonerating when the transgressor is in a position of high status (Lee,
Peterson, & Tiedens, 2004; Lee & Robinson, 2000;
Lee & Tiedens, 2001). High-status individuals are
expected to be able to control outcomes, so an
account claiming an external and uncontrollable cause may violate the receiver’s role expectations and/or may not be deemed credible. In
these cases stability attributions may be the
most critical to understand, since they become
the only viable causal attribution dimension to
manage. In addition, Weiner (1985) argues that
stability attributions are the primary driver of
future expectations. Consistent with this, Tomlinson et al. (2004) found that a victim’s assessment of the probability of a future violation predicts the individual’s willingness to reconcile
with the offender. Surprisingly, prior work on
trust repair has virtually neglected the stability
construct.
Weiner’s (1986) theory also explicates specific
emotional reactions in the attribution process by
showing how causal attribution dimensions
lead to specific emotional reactions (anger and
fear) and how these emotions shape subsequent
trustworthiness and trust. Although some researchers have discussed emotions as relevant
in trust decline and repair (Lewicki & Bunker,
1996; Lewis & Weigert, 1985), the trust literature
has tended to focus on cognitive factors. This
has prompted calls for more work explaining the
role of emotions (Jones & George, 1998), as provided in this paper.
Several implications can be derived from this
framework. First, causal attribution dimensions
suggest how trust can be repaired, as indicated
by different reparative efforts working through
different dimensions of attributions. Postdecline
trust can be repaired when the trustee’s attributions regarding the outcome’s cause are altered.
Stated differently, trust can be repaired when
the past (i.e., the cause of the negative outcome
and ensuing sense of violation) is resolved. Specifically, both what was damaged and how it
was damaged imply the type of reparative effort
needed. This may explain why implicit apolo-

<-----Page 16----->2009

Tomlinson and Mayer

gies that attempt to placate the trustor or
“smooth over” the violation do not stimulate reconciliation (Tomlinson et al., 2004).
Another implication is that it is important for a
response in the wake of trust decline to be attributed to internal and controllable causes. Volitional efforts to repair trust are more likely to
be seen as genuine evidence of instability of the
cause of a negative outcome, whereas “forced”
apologies in response to media pressure are
unlikely to signal true repentance, remorse, and
reform, which are critical to the unstable attributions important to trust repair (Gold & Weiner,
2000).
While much can be gained by using Weiner’s
(1986) causal attribution theory to understand
trust decline and repair, we acknowledge several limitations of this work that should prompt
future research. First, while Weiner’s theory acknowledges various influences on causal attributions, such as the social context, prior history
of the relationship, and attribution biases, it
does not articulate these influences. To be parsimonious, we have only developed propositions on the process of how attribution dimensions relate to trust decline and repair. Based on
Weiner’s attribution theory, our model implicitly
acknowledges that an individual’s attributional
biases (e.g., fundamental attribution error) may
influence the proposed relationships in substantive ways. Future work needs to address this
limitation, since such factors are believed to
influence trust (Möllering, 2006).
One of the major purposes of our research was
to use Weiner’s attribution theory to develop an
understanding of how trustworthiness and trust
are updated after a negative outcome as a platform for determining effective repair efforts. We
considered the effect of each of Weiner’s attribution dimensions, as well as some of the interactions. For example, regardless of attributions
of controllability and stability, an attribution of
external locus of control means the cause is
unrelated to the trustee. Since this means trust
in that trustee is not damaged, trust repair is
moot. While consideration of each possible interaction among the three attribution dimensions was beyond the scope of this paper, future
research in this area may prove fruitful. Likewise, based on Weiner’s attribution theory, our
model implicitly acknowledges that an individual’s attributional biases (e.g., fundamental attribution error) may influence the proposed rela-

101

tionships in substantive ways. We believe
future research could provide valuable insights
into this matter.
We developed our analysis around social accounts, but such responses may be less than
optimal, especially if they are interpreted as an
attempt to look trustworthy instead of to be trustworthy (cf. Greenberg, 1990). Many have criticized accounts as “cheap talk”— costless to the
speaker and unverifiable (Farrell & Rabin, 1996).
Future work should continue to examine substantive means of influencing attributions in the
wake of a decline in trust (Bottom et al., 2002;
Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005), as well as how
those other techniques interact with accounts.
Finally, the notions of reconciliation and forgiveness are only beginning to be studied in the
organizational sciences (e.g., Aquino et al.,
2003). More work is needed in this area, and
important questions remain that are not directly
addressed in this research. What is the role of
time in the attributional process? Does time heal
all wounds, or does the passage of time make
injuries from negative outcomes seem less salient? Conversely, are there types of transgressions that are more likely to “fester” with time? In
what ways does the severity of the offense or magnitude of the negative outcome affect attributions
and willingness to forgive and reconcile?
In conclusion, Weiner’s (1986) causal attribution theory provides important conceptual
mechanisms (causal attributions, specific emotional reactions) that clarify the process of trust
decline and repair. Per Lewicki and Bunker’s
call, it provides a useful “blueprint for action”
(1996: 137) to stimulate a deeper understanding
of trust repair.
