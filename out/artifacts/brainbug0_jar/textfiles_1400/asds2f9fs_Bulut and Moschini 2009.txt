Consistent with the rights and incentives provided by the Bayh–Dole Act of 1980,
US universities have increased their involvement in patenting and licensing activities
through their own technology transfer oﬃces. Only a few US universities are obtaining
large returns, however, whereas others are continuing with these activities despite negligible or negative returns. We assess the US universities’ potential to generate returns
from licensing activities by modeling and estimating quantiles of the distribution of net
licensing returns conditional on some of their structural characteristics. We ﬁnd limited
prospects for public universities without a medical school everywhere in their distribution. Other groups of universities (private, and public with a medical school) can expect
better but still fairly modest returns. These ﬁndings call into question the appropriateness
of the revenue-generating motive for the aggressive rate of patenting and licensing by
US universities.

1. Introduction
Some critical policy shifts strengthening intellectual property rights (IPRs) in the United
States have taken place over the last quarter century. These include the Bayh–Dole Act
of 1980, which made it possible for universities to retain title to patents derived from
federally funded research, as well as the establishment of the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in 1982 and some critical US Supreme Court decisions. Concomitant with
these pro-IPR policy shifts, more and more US universities have became directly involved
in licensing activities. The number of universities with a technology transfer oﬃce (TTO)
increased from 25 in 1980 to 200 in 1990, and by 2000 virtually every US university had
such an oﬃce (Nelson 2001). A 15-fold increase in university patenting and a more than
5-fold increase in the number of universities granted patents were observed between 1965
and 1992 (Henderson et al. 1998). This trend in US universities’ patenting and licensing
activities has accelerated in the last decade (Sampat 2006). US patents issued to 69 US

universities that are 9-year recurrent respondents to Association of University Technology
Managers (AUTM) surveys increased 129% between 1993 and 2001. Licenses and options
executed by 55 US universities that are 11-year recurrent respondents to AUTM surveys
increased 139% between 1991 and 2001, and their gross license revenue increased 485%
between 1991 and 2001. The aggregate gross license revenue obtained by all US universities
approached $1 billion in FY 2002 (AUTM 2002).
This growth in university patenting and licensing activities has generated considerable
attention in economic research (Jaﬀe 2000; Nelson 2001; Mazzoleni and Sampat 2002;
Link et al. 2003; Mowery et al. 2004; Mazzoleni 2005; Sampat 2006). Issues considered
include whether these activities have aﬀected the traditional role of universities, typically
understood to be the advancement of science and the dissemination of knowledge; whether
Bayh–Dole was necessary to induce technology transfer and provided the right incentives
for universities; and the social welfare implications of university patenting.
The underlying presumption of Bayh–Dole is that without (exclusive) licensing arrangements, ﬁrms would not undertake the follow-up investment to bring an invention to the
marketplace as products or services. Mazzoleni (2005) showed that this presumption is
too general and its validity depends on innovation-speciﬁc conditions. If the disclosure by
universities does not prevent the downstream ﬁrms from patenting the developed product,
licensing the invention could be welfare enhancing only if ﬁrms engage in socially excessive
R&D under open access.1 Although the Act was intended for inventions that would not be
developed and commercialized without patenting and licensing, universities obviously can
exploit their rights more generally for all patentable inventions. The Cohen–Bayer recombinant DNA technique (licensed by the University of California and Stanford University)
and Richard Axel’s co-transformation process (licensed by Columbia University) are examples of university inventions for which technology transfer would certainly have occurred
absent patenting and licensing. University licensing in these cases has simply taxed industry, and ultimately consumers, for use of these technologies (Sampat 2006). Quite clearly,
when it comes to patenting and licensing, universities are likely to behave based on their
self-interest rather than the public interest. Beath et al. (2003) considered the possibility
that universities, with reduced state and federal ﬁnancial support, could provide incentives
to faculty to engage in activities that can augment inventors’ incomes. Furthermore, TTO
managers as agents may have short-term horizons and give priority to monetary returns in
their activities. In fact, based on a recent survey of 76 major US universities, the licensing
income generated is found to be the most important criterion by which TTO oﬃces measure
their success (Thursby et al. 2001).
Because increased revenue is one of the considerations motivating universities in this
context, a relevant question concerns the extent of net returns that universities are collecting from these activities. Figure 1 presents the distribution of net license returns (license
revenues received less the net legal fees paid and the operating cost of TTOs, in million
dollars) for 148 US universities, averaged over the 5-year period 1998–2002 (see the data
section for details). It is apparent that only a few universities are earning large returns.
In fact, the top 20 universities obtain 83% of the aggregate net license returns generated,
whereas most of the other universities earn negative or negligible net returns. Figure 2
presents the distribution of the net license returns as a percentage of the university’s total
research expenditures. This distribution is also highly skewed: the ratio is high for only a
few universities, whereas it is <5% for the majority of them (90%).2
The overall picture is that of a few universities generating signiﬁcant returns, whereas
the majority of universities continue licensing activities even though they appear to earn
negative net returns or just break even. Obviously, these universities are hoping to do better in

the future, an expectation perhaps predicated on the very asymmetric distribution of returns
discussed earlier. As might be suggested by Jovanovic’s (1982) theory of ‘noisy’ selection
with incomplete information (wherein new entrants in any industry are likely to be less sure
about their eﬃciencies and more likely to fail), new TTO oﬃces are perhaps discovering
their eﬃciency in generating net returns from licensing activities as they operate, and are
likely to be (and perhaps remain) unproﬁtable.
Given the examples of big winners among universities, what can others, conditional on
their characteristics, anticipate as the potential for generating economic return? This question has not been addressed in a coherent econometric study in the literature, and thus we
wish to address it directly in what follows. Related existing work includes Trune (1996),

<-----Page 4----->126

H. Bulut and G. Moschini

who analyzed the licensing activities of US universities with the purpose of developing
a ‘national criterion’ with which universities can measure their performance. Trune and
Goslin (1998) calculated the proﬁtability of technology transfer programs of universities
and found that nearly 60% of the universities are earning negative proﬁts from maintaining TTOs. Siegel et al. (2003) did a productivity analysis of TTO performance in
terms of license revenues (taken as a proxy for technology transfer activities) by using
the stochastic frontier estimation approach. Lach and Schankerman (2004) found that
universities with higher royalty shares to inventors generated signiﬁcantly higher license
revenues.

2. The modeling framework
In order to assess the potential of US universities in generating economic returns from
licensing activities given their characteristics, we model and estimate the select quantiles
as linear functions of a set of characteristics of universities. We take this route because the
conventional conditional mean analysis may not adequately convey the potential for private
returns to universities when, as is the case here, the distribution of net economic returns
of US universities is highly skewed. This skewness is apparent from the data reported
in Table 2. Fifty percent of the US university population earns less than $0.31 million,
whereas the average net return is $4.42 million.3 The standard deviation is large; 75% of
the population obtains less than half of the mean, which implies that the mean is strongly
inﬂuenced by the upper 10% of the population.
In addition, the quantile regression helps us to describe the entire conditional distribution. By taking this approach, we can look at the impacts of covariates at diﬀerent points
in the distribution. We are interested in how the marginal impacts of covariates vary with
the ranking of universities in terms of generating licensing return (in the case of the conditional mean estimation the slope coeﬃcients are forced to be the same at all quantiles).
Assuming a particular skewed distribution and parameterizing its mean does not seem to be
a promising avenue either. There is no consensus over a speciﬁc distribution governing the
innovation process per se. Based on various data on citation and value measures of patent
signiﬁcance, which includes license revenue data of Harvard University, Silverberg and
Verspagen (2004) ﬁnd that overall ﬁt of the distribution resembles log normal, whereas the
Pareto distribution ﬁts the tails better. They note the implication that the second and even
the ﬁrst moments of underlying distributions may not even exist. With quantile regression,
the existence of moments is not a concern because the focus is on quantiles, and every
distribution has quantiles.

2.1. Quantile regression
The basic quantile regression model (Koenker and Hallock 2001) assumes that the conditional quantiles are linear functions of the explanatory variables. Assume that we have
a sample of N observations from a population, that is, {(yi , xi ) : i = 1, . . . , N }, where the
subscript i indexes each observation, yi is the licensing return, and xi is the K × 1 vector of
explanatory variables (a set of characteristics), which can include the intercept term. Moreover, let τ ∈ (0, 1) deﬁne the quantile of interest; let β(τ ) be the corresponding parameter
vector for the vector of characteristics that vary with quantiles; and let Qτ (.) be the quantile
function, which is deﬁned as the inverse function of F(.), the underlying conditional (on
xi ) cumulative distribution function for yi . Then the quantile of interest is written as a linear

<-----Page 5----->Economics of Innovation and New Technology

function of a set of characteristics as
yi = xi β(τ ) + ui (τ )

(1)

xi β(τ )

(2)

Qτ (yi |xi ) =

where ui (τ ) denotes the error term, which is also a function of the quantile of interest
(Buchinsky 1998; Koenker 2005). Based on the preceding two equations, error terms must
satisfy the quantile restriction
Qτ (ui (τ )|xi ) = 0
(3)
The parameter estimates for the τ th sample quantile minimizes the weighted absolute
deviations (the errors); that is

τ |yi − xi β| +
(1 − τ )|yi − xi β|⎦
(4)
β∈RK

i∈{i:yi <xi β}

i∈{i:yi ≥xi β}

where |.| is the absolute value operator and the other notation as deﬁned before. For τ = 0.5,
one would weigh deviations equally, which is known as median regression. Weights diﬀer for
other quantiles, such as τ = 0.75; one would weight positive deviations with 0.25 whereas
one would weight negative deviations with 0.75. The rationale for the suggested weights
in Equation (4) is as follows. Recall that the τ th quantile denotes the maximum value that
yi can take with given probability τ . Then, the probability to observe a value less than the
quantile is τ , whereas the probability to observe a value beyond that quantile is (1 − τ ).
Quantile regression has emerged as a comprehensive method and found applications in
various ﬁelds of economics, including labor economics, wealth distribution, and various
disciplines such as ﬁnance, medicine, demographics, and environmental modeling (see
Fitzenberger et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2003). In particular, quantile regression has found use
in the ﬁnance literature via the notions of value at risk (VaRτ ) and conditional value at
risk (CVaRτ ) (Uryasev and Trindade 2004). Based on a given loss distribution, VaRτ is
the maximum amount one can lose at a given probability τ , i.e., the τ th quantile. CVaRτ
is deﬁned as the expected value of loss beyond a VaRτ . Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000)
show that CVaRτ has better properties as a measure of risk.
Instead of loss distribution typically used in VaRτ and CVaRτ literature, here we work
with gain distribution. Estimating a given quantile then shows the maximum amount a
university can gain at a given level of probability. In order to estimate the expected value
beyond a given quantile (CVaRτ ), we use the relations derived in Uryasev and Trindade
(2004). First, deﬁne functions [.]+ as [v]+ ≡ max{v, 0} for generic variable v ∈ R, and
denote the estimated τ th quantile (VaRτ ) with Q̂τ (y|x). Then the relation of interest is
E(y|y ≥ Q̂τ (y|x)) = Q̂τ (y|x) +

1
E([y − Q̂τ (y|x)]+ )
(1 − τ )

(5)

For a sample of N observations from a population, yi for i = 1, . . . , N , one can estimate the
expectation on the right-hand side of Equation (5) with the method-of-moments approach
as
N
1 
[yi − Q̂τ (y|x)]+
(6)
E([y − Qτ (y|x)]+ ) =
N i=1
Inserting Equation (6) into (5) yields the desired estimate.

2.2. Data
Table 1 lists the variables that we use in our analysis, along with their brief descriptions,
and Table 2 provides summary statistics. Our data pertain to 148 US universities over the
5-year period from 1998 to 2002 and are aggregated at the university level.4 We compute the
annual averages of the time-varying variables (both dependent and explanatory variables)
over the sample period. This approach is also adopted in Siegel et al. (2003).
The dependent variable of our model is the net licensing return for each university. This
is calculated as the total license revenue less the cost of patenting and licensing activities.
The cost is measured as the sum of net legal fee expenditures (legal fees expended less
legal fees reimbursed) and operating expenditures of TTOs (salary expenses plus beneﬁts
to the employees and overhead cost).5 The net licensing return variable is averaged over the
sample period 1998–2002. The source for the license revenue and legal fees reimbursed and
expended is AUTM (1998–2002) surveys. To compute the cost of operating expenditures of
TTOs, we relied on employment data from AUTM surveys and used salary data from College
and University Personnel Association (CUPA) administrative compensation surveys. CUPA
surveys provide data for the top two positions in TTOs for the period 1998–2002. Note that
the cost items considered here do not include the opportunity cost of time of faculty who
are involved in patent and licensing activities, and therefore the real cost to universities of
their patenting and licensing activities is underestimated.
The explanatory variables that we use in our model are meant to capture some basic
structural characteristic that, at least in the short run, may be considered as exogenous.
These variables are as follows:
(a) Whether a university is public or private, and whether or not it has a medical
school. These are dummy variables constructed from information provided by
AUTM surveys.
(b) Log of size of the university. Natural logarithm of size of the university, whereby
size of the university is measured by total research expenditures and averaged over
the sample period 1998–2002. The data source is AUTM (1998–2002) surveys.

Note: ‘N ’ is the number of observations; ‘net returns’ and ‘size’ are measured in million dollars.

(c) Log of quality of the faculty. Natural logarithm of quality of the faculty, whereby
we proxy quality of the faculty by the total number of citations per faculty in
technological departments.6 This is obtained from the National Survey of Graduate
Faculty completed in 1993 (National Research Council 1995). Note that this variable
is thus predetermined given the sample period we covered, which is 1998–2002.
(d) Local industrial R&D intensity. We measure this variable as the share of industryperformed R&D in private-industry output in the state of a given university.
It is the average of available years (1998 and 2000) in the period of interest, expressed as a percentage. The data are obtained from the National Science
Foundation.7
The characteristics captured by the dummy variables in Equation (a) have long been
considered of interest. Because public universities are more vulnerable to budget crises
(Link et al. 2003), they may license more aggressively. On the other hand, public universities
may be less ﬂexible culturally and bureaucratically in interacting with private companies
(Siegel et al. 2003); therefore, ceteris paribus, they may have a lower licensing rate. Lach
and Schankerman (2004) found that private universities are more eﬀective in terms of
generating licensing income compared to public universities and warranted future research
on the determinants of this observation.
Regarding the medical school eﬀect, we note that biomedical research has emerged as a
productive ﬁeld whose research output has attracted the interest of industry, and this trend
was present before the passage of the Bayh–Dole Act (Mowery et al. 2004). Hence, having
a medical school is expected to provide a signiﬁcant advantage in terms of generating
return from licensing activities. In fact, top university licenses by revenue generation are
biomedical (Eisenstein and Resnick 2001).

The variable in Equation (b) captures the quantitative side of the research potential of
a given university. The interest is on the value of additional research dollars, and how it
varies with the rank of universities in terms of licensing return, that is, across quantiles. The
variable in Equation (c) captures the qualitative side of a university’s research potential.
The quality of inventions obviously matters in assessing the inventions’ revenue-generating
potential, and the quality of inventions can be presumed to be positively associated with
the quality of faculty. Finally, the variable in Equation (d) is meant to determine if the
revenue-generating abilities of a university is aﬀected by its location – the local economic
conditions that are mostly outside of a university’s control.
Before proceeding to the econometric analysis, it is worth commenting brieﬂy on the
net returns of Table 2. The average net return from patenting and licensing – across all 148
institutions and over the 5-year period of our sample – is $4.42 million. This is certainly not
an inconspicuous amount and underscores the extent of the activities being undertaken by
TTOs in US universities. But these net returns still represent a fairly small amount when
considered within the scope of the R&D eﬀorts undertaken. Over the period considered,
the average annual total research expenditures at these universities was $183.7 million.
Thus, if one were to focus exclusively on the commercial licensing outcome, the ‘yield’
for the average US university (i.e., the average net return as a percentage of the average
research expenditures) would be a paltry 2.41%. This percent return is quite variable for
the structural groups that are identiﬁed in Table 2. For public universities it is 2.06% if
they have a medical school and 0.43% if they do not have a medical school; for private
universities the percent return is 4.25% if they have a medical school and 2.80% if they do
not have a medical school.
3. Estimation procedure
Quantile regression estimation was carried out by using the QUANTREG package in R,
an open source software project.8 A brief introductory tutorial on quantile regression with
R is provided in Koenker (2007). To estimate the standard errors, we used the xy-pair
bootstrapping technique. This technique resamples from the joint empirical distribution of
y and x. Buchinsky (1995) shows through Monte Carlo simulations that the design matrix
bootstrap technique performs well under heteroskedastic errors, for relatively small sample
sizes, and it is robust to changes in the bootstrap sample size relative to sample size. The
resampling in our study was done for 5000 repetitions to ensure stability in standard errors
(we followed a procedure similar to that of Canarella and Pollard, 2004, in setting the number
of repetitions). Finally, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of conditional mean models
is done by using SAS (SAS Institute 2003).
4. Results
Table 3 presents the OLS estimation of the conditional mean and quantile regression estimations of the 0.10th , 0.25th, 0.5th, 0.75th, 0.9th , and 0.95th quantiles. By using ANOVA
function in the QUANTREG package, we ﬁnd that the null hypothesis of equality of slope
parameters across the quantiles (an implication of conditional mean modeling) is strongly
rejected (p-value of < 0.0001) based on the Wald test statistic distributed χ -square with one
degree of freedom. The results in this table show that conditional quantile modeling does
not make much diﬀerence in terms of statistical signiﬁcance, but it does matter in terms of
the economic signiﬁcance of the variables considered. The magnitudes of estimated coefﬁcients are much higher at the upper and much lower at the lower quantiles than in the

conditional mean model. Comparing the estimated coeﬃcients of conditional median and
mean models, the latter is clearly inﬂuenced by upper quantiles and may not adequately
reﬂect the performance of a typical university in the population. The conditional mean
model also under-predicts the net returns of universities positioned in upper quantiles.
Looking at the results of the quantile regression in more detail, the intercept is statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels in all quantiles. We recall that the base group to
which the intercept applies is that of public universities without a medical school. Private
universities without a medical school and public universities with a medical school are not
statistically diﬀerent than this base group. Nevertheless, in upper quantiles of the distribution, starting with the 0.75th quantile, these two groups of universities have positive and
mostly increasing coeﬃcients; that is, their diﬀerence over the base group is much more
accentuated in the upper quantiles of the distribution. Private universities with a medical
school obtain signiﬁcantly higher returns than the base group at the 0.25th quantile and
their coeﬃcient is positive in all quantiles and monotonically increases toward the upper
end of distribution (it is nearly $15 million at the 0.95th quantile).
The signs of the other variables are positive in all quantiles, as perhaps should be
expected. The log of size variable is statistically signiﬁcant at conventional levels in all
quantiles above the 0.10th quantile. The return to an additional 1% increase in total research
expenditures (which is obtained directly from the estimated coeﬃcient of the size variable,
upon dividing by 100) is initially $1027 at the 0.1th quantile, is monotonically increasing
toward higher quantiles, and becomes $64,452 at the 0.95th quantile. Despite more than a
60-fold diﬀerence in the values of additional research expenditures between the two tails of
the distribution, the impact is still very small, even at the 0.95th quantile, when compared
with the size of research expenditures (which, as reported in Table 2, is $183.4 million for
the average university).
Similarly, the coeﬃcient of log of faculty quality, upon dividing by 100, shows the
impact of a 1% increase in faculty productivity (as proxied here by citations received to
publications in technology ﬁelds). The impact of 1% increase in the quality of faculty at
the 10th quantile of the distribution is merely $339, whereas its value at the 0.95th quantile
($9206) is nearly six times the value ($1450) at the median. Thus, the marginal value of
an increase in faculty quality is higher for those universities that are already obtaining high
net returns from licensing.
Finally, the impact of the local industrial R&D variable (industrial R&D as the share of
industry output in the state of a given university) has a positive sign everywhere and increases
with the quantiles of the distribution (except at the very upper end of the distribution). To
interpret the estimated coeﬃcient, recall that this variable is measured in percent terms and
that its sample average is 1.91%. Hence, a unit increase in this variable corresponds to more
than a 50% increase in the amount of industry R&D (holding industrial output constant).
With such a big change in the amount of industry-performed R&D, the resulting synergy
(in the form of net licensing returns) is predicted to be nearly $2.2 million for universities
positioned around the 0.9th quantile, whereas the same impact is only about $107,000 at
the median (and smaller still at lower quantiles). Therefore, local industry R&D intensity
appears to matter mostly for universities positioned at the very high end of the net returns
distribution.
Based on the estimates in Table 3, we predict select quantiles for the structural groups
of universities that we have identiﬁed (public and private, and with and without a medical
school) at the mean characteristics of each group. Table 4 presents the predicted values for
select quantiles. Based on these estimates, Figure 3 plots the underlying distributions for
the average university in each group.

Predicted quantiles (at the mean characteristics, in million dollars).

From Figure 3, we observe that the average private university with a medical school
ranks highest in terms of generating licensing return in all quantiles, whereas the average
public university without a medical school is dominated by others in all quantiles in that
regard. These structural diﬀerences are increasing with the level of quantiles. The average
private university without a medical school and the average public university with a medical
school appear to have similar distributions. This suggests that they may have close expected
values but may diﬀer in terms of dispersion of licensing returns.
The estimates of the 0.95th quantiles in Table 4 show that there is a 95% chance that
licensing returns will not exceed $32.9 million for an average private university with a
medical school, $21.19 million for an average public university with a medical school,
$18.77 million for an average private university without a medical school, and $11.59
million for an average public university without a medical school. These estimated values
for the 0.95th quantiles are 14.53%, 9.51%, 12.73%, and 10.51% of the corresponding
average sizes, respectively.

We further estimate what the average university in each group can expect beyond the
0.95th quantile, as described in Equations (5) and (6). Note that the group public universities
without a medical school does not have a single realized observation beyond the predicted
value of 0.95th quantile during the sample period covered here, which is consistent with
the limited prospects for this group that emerges from our analysis. For this reason, the
expected value beyond the 0.95th quantile for the average public university without a
medical school is not estimated. For the other groups, Table 4 reports the estimated expected
net returns beyond the 0.95th quantile, along with the overall estimated expected net returns.
Speciﬁcally, the last column of Table 4 can be interpreted as the expected value of net returns
conditional on a university being in the top 5% of earners of its group (as identiﬁed by the
characteristics of being public or private, and of whether or not the university possesses a
medical school). One way to gauge the information in the last column of Table 4 is to relate
it to the corresponding estimated 0.95th quantile. This ratio turns out to be 1.79, 2.56, and
2.5, respectively, for the average university that is private without a medical school, public
with a medical school, and private with a medical school.
In summary, there was no evidence of a fatter tail for an average public university
without a medical school. For all other groups, on the other hand, the right tail of the
distribution of returns is fatter. In particular, the gains in relative returns associated with
being in the top 5% of earners is highest for universities with a medical school. In any event,
the expected returns of the top 5% of earners remain a relatively small fraction of the total
research expenditure of the universities.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have assessed the potential of US universities in generating economic
returns from licensing activities, conditional on some of their characteristics. Recognizing
that the underlying distribution is highly skewed, we model and estimate the select quantiles
as linear functions of a set of characteristics of universities, and also provide OLS estimation
of the conditional mean model as a benchmark. Our statistical ﬁnding that the estimated
slope coeﬃcients of characteristics are not constant over the quantile points supports the
modeling of the quantiles of net licensing returns distribution.
We found that the economic impacts of explanatory variables log of size of research dollars and log of faculty quality (measured as the citations received in technology ﬁelds) and
industrial R&D (a measure of local economic conditions) are positive and monotonically
increasing in almost all quantiles. Regarding the marginal impacts of the characteristics
along the quantiles, we found that the marginal ‘rate of return’ of research funds for an
average-size university does not exceed 0.5% in any quantile we considered. Similarly,
the impact of faculty quality remains modest. Even in the hypothetical case in which the
research productivity doubles, the change in net licensing returns would not exceed 13%
of the average net licensing returns in any quantiles. The economic impact of the industrial
R&D variable indicates synergies between industry-performed R&D intensity and university net licensing returns at the state level. Nevertheless, these synergies may not spill over
uniformly and appear important only for universities that are at the very high end of the
distribution of net returns.
We also found structural diﬀerences in the licensing return distributions of groups of
universities depending on whether they are private or public and on whether or not they
have a medical school. In terms of generating licensing returns after controlling for other
factors, private universities with a medical school appear to have an institutional advantage
over other groups. Public universities with a medical school and private universities without

a medical school are close at the distributional points. Public universities without a medical
school are dominated by other groups at all quantile points.
We ﬁnd that the net returns from patenting and licensing by US universities are, on
average, quite modest. A rationalization that is sometimes proﬀered as to why universities
should continue with their patenting and licensing activities, even when they are making
negligible or negative returns, relies on the marked skewness of the returns distribution,
i.e., on the notion of ‘waiting for the big one.’ Our estimate of the expected net licensing
returns, conditional on a university being in the top 5% of earners of its group, helps to
quantify this scenario. The expected payoﬀ for being a winner is highest for universities
with a medical school and for private universities. This is in line with the argument in Lach
and Schankerman (2004) that private universities are more eﬃcient in terms of generating
licensing returns, although our results emphasize the impact of having a medical school.
Based on the estimated marginal eﬀects and the structural diﬀerences among the group
of universities, we would argue that universities should form a more realistic perspective of
the possible economic returns from patenting and licensing activities. The potential in terms
of generating returns appears particularly limited for public universities without a medical
school. The fairly modest overall expected licensing returns, especially when compared with
the investment in university research expenditures, suggest that the increased emphasis on
university patenting and licensing that has emerged in the United States in the last quarter
century should perhaps be reconsidered, especially when attempts to privatize some of
the returns of university research appear to conﬂict with the traditional public research
objectives of fostering basic research and disseminating knowledge.

On the other hand, Jensen and Thursby (2001) suggest that Bayh–Dole may have a further enabling
eﬀect because the resulting license contracts can be designed to induce collaboration between
faculty inventors and licensee ﬁrms in developing typically ‘embryonic’ university inventions.
Note also that the big earners in Figure 1 are not necessarily those with high ratios in Figure 2.
For example, the University of California System has the third-largest net license return but that
is only 2.6% of its total research budget. Moreover, Columbia University earns the highest net
license return ($109.6 million), whereas Florida State University receives the highest net return
relative to its research budget (41.6%).
To put this mean net return into perspective, we note that it is only 2.41% of the average research
budget (total research expenditures) of universities.
Pooling the observations over this time period yielded an initial sample of 173 US universities.
After adjusting for the missing observations on explanatory variables, we are left with the ﬁnal
sample of 148 observations from US universities.
Legal fees expended are the expenditures of an institution on external legal fees, which include
prosecuting, maintenance, and interference costs of patents and copyrights. They also include
minor litigation costs. Legal fees reimbursed are the legal fee expenditures reimbursed to the
institution by licensees (AUTM 2002).
We normalize the citations received at each technological department by the number of faculty in
that department and sum over these departments in order to obtain total number of citations per
faculty in technological departments in a given university. Alternative indexes for faculty quality
can be ‘scholarly quality of faculty (ratings) in technological departments’ and the ‘number of
publications per faculty in technological departments.’
