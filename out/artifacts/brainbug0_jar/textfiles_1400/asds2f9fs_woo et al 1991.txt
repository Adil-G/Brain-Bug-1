The impact of the entrepreneur on the development and subsequent success
of a new venture has been demonstrated in many studies. Indeed one of
the most important judgement calls of professionals assisting entrepreneurs
is to evaluate their strengths, limitations, management practices, and likelihood of success. Research has responded to the need for such evaluation
with dtjferent attempts to identify the relevant characteristics of the entrepreneur that may bear upon the management practices and subsequent success of new ventures.
One direction of this research has led to the identijcation of different types of entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurs within each typology share common traits but direr significantly from those of other
types. Such attempts are useful in that they identify key differences within the larger population of
entrepreneurs and do so in a way that yields holistic and meaningful portrayals. More importantly,
classtjications allow us to make better predictions, based on membership in a specific typology, about
the likely behavior, responses, and success of the entrepreneur. These offer a power&l conceptual
tool for the evaluation of entrepreneurs during the start-up or early stages of a venture before the
track record of the individual involved can be established and observed.
Research studies over the last decade appear to converge on two types of entrepreneurs,
craftsmen and opportunists. Craftsmen usually come from a blue collar background with limited
education and managerial experience. They prefer technical work to administrative tasks and are
generally motivated by needs for personal autonomy rather than the desire for organizational or
financial success. In contrast, opportunists are characterized by broader experiences and higher levels
of education. They are more likely to be motivated by$nancial gains and the opportunity for building
a successful organization. These two types have been widely accepted and have been found to differ

in regard to an array of characteristics and behavior. For example, the two types appear to engage
in deferent levels of explicit planning and information gathering in preparation for the start-up of
business. The ventures shared by the two types can also be contrasted along such dimensions as size,
capital, the presence of partners, and relatedness to prior experience. The two types also manage
differently as exhibited in the formality of administrative procedures, allocation of time to dt$Ierent
functions, spans of control, and levels of authority. Some evidence suggests that the typology even
appears to distinguish entrepreneurs in terms of attitudes toward risk, adaptiveness to change, and
cognitive processing of opportunities. Most important, the classification seems to suggest that typologies
differ in regard to growth potential and the likelihood that ventures will proceed to the next life cycle
stage. The class$cation consisting of these two types of entrepreneurs represents a critical contribution
to the extent that it possesses strong predictive power regarding a range of entrepreneurial behavior
and performance.
This study focuses upon the conceptual frameworks used and spec$ic methods applied in developing entrepreneurial typologies. It examines the extent to which different entrepreneurial typologies
are consistent. It seeks to alert us to how the methods used in developing typologies affect the results.
It suggests that typologies developed to date lack comparability and predictive power.
A close examination of previous studies disclosed major differences in the criteria used to
classify entrepreneurs. Thus, craftsmen in one study might have been identt$ied on the basis of two
characteristics, whereas another study employed as many as SO criteria. In some studies, all entrepreneurs are classtfied into typologies, whereas in others, many entrepreneurs are “in-bemeens” and
left unclassified. The same labels have often been applied to types derived through divergent methodologies, suggesting a degree of commonality that may be misleading. There is the appearance of
a body of consistent and additive knowledge about craftsmen and opportunist entrepreneurs that does
not rest upon a careful consideration of the methodologies employed.
Yet, how likely are we to obtain the same groupings of entrepreneurs from different classification
schemes as implicitly assumed in the cross-references we have accepted?This study explicitly evaluated
the impact of such differences by contrasting the groupings of entrepreneurs obtained through three
different classifications. It is, we think, theJirst empirical examination of the extent to which traditionally
defined entrepreneurial typologies are sensitive to the classification criteria used. Patterned after
demonstrated practices in the literature, this study grouped entrepreneurs using: (1) goals; (2) goals
and background (education and experience); and (3) goals, background, and management style. Within
each classification, entrepreneurs were divided into two groups using cluster analysis. The results
showed that diflerent classtfication criteria did result in dtJferent groupings. In particular, classt@ation
based solely on goal orientation demonstrated the most pronounced differences from the results of the
other classtfications. Second, we found that none of the three pairs of groups patterned closely the
craftsmanlopportunist delineation as described in the literature.
The primary conclusion that direrent groupings result from different classihcation frameworks
should not be surprising, at least from a methodological standpoint. Yet the problem has been totally
overlooked in the analysis and interpretation of entrepreneurial types. Very likely, the same labels
may have been applied to rather different entities. What then are the implications for the use of this
typology as an evaluative tool? First, we note that the dejinitions of craftsman and opportunist have
not been resolved and take on as many variations as the number of studies on the topic. Second, the
jindings of each study have not really been corroborated by jindings in other analyses. As such, the
level of generalizability and confidence attached to each must be checked. Third, the cumulative
evidence in the body of literature on entrepreneurial typologies cannot be taken as additive knowledge
about the wide range of characteristics associated with each type. Hence, the predictive power of the
craftsman-opportunist
typology cannot be taken for granted. Fourth, it remains to be demonstrated
what percentage of the population of entrepreneurs can be represented by the two types. How universal
are craftsman and opportunist entrepreneurs or can only some entrepreneurs be classified in this way?
Do other types, though yet unidentified, exist? The above reservations lead us to conclude that while
the craftsman-opportunist
classification appears to serve as a useful yardstick for measuring the
potential behavior and likely success of entrepreneurs, its applicability and scope may have been

<-----Page 2----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

exaggerated to this point. This is not to say that typologies have little value, but rather to demonstrate
the need for consistency and careful consideration of the dejinition of types before integrated and
validated portrayals of entrepreneurs can be developed. Without these, the validity of our yardstick
remains questionable.

INTRODUCTION
A central theme in entrepreneurial
research focuses on the motivations and background
characteristics of the entrepreneur. Historically, much of this research has examined how
entrepreneurs’ are similar to or different from the general population (see review by Vesper
1980). Much of the research has also centered upon how characteristics of entrepreneurs
may contribute to success and eventual development of the new venture (Cooper et al. 1987;
Van de Ven et al. 1984; Low and MacMillan 1988; Kimberley 1979; Mintzberg and Waters
1982). In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to how groups of entrepreneurs
differ from each other. Thus, there is explicit recognition that there is diversity among
entrepreneurs and that understanding can be advanced through grouping them according to
certain common characteristics (Smith 1967; Braden 1977; Filley and Aldag 1978; Dunkelberg and Cooper 1982; Smith and Miner 1983; Lorraine and Dussault 1987; Davidsson
1988; Lafuente and Salas 1989). The development of typologies represents a middle ground
between treating each entrepreneur as unique and representing diverse populations through
one set of averages.
This study focuses upon the development of entrepreneurial
typologies. We suggest
that the evolving stream of research on entrepreneurial
typologies is proceeding forward
without careful consideration
and integration of its underlying premises. Thus, although
terms such as “craftsman entrepreneur” or “opportunistic entrepreneur” are frequently encountered, there may be more consistency in the use of terms than in the underlying constructs.
These distinctions are not merely pedantic. If we are to improve our ability to advise
entrepreneurs and to appraise their prospects, then we must determine what membership in
particular typologies implies. If research on entrepreneurial studies is to make progress, then
it is important that we build upon solid ground.
In this paper we first review classification theory and consider reasons for the utilization
of typologies in many fields. We then examine the research done to date on entrepreneurial
typologies. We note that, although entrepreneurial
typologies may bear the same names,
they often reflect major differences in the underlying constructs. The paper then tests explicitly, using a large data base, whether these distinctions in the way typologies are developed make a difference. Implications for researchers and for advisors to entrepreneurs
are then developed.

CLASSIFICATION

AND THEORY DEVELOPMENT

Classification or “systematics” is the science of developing typologies or arranging phenomena into categories (McKelvey 1982; Sneath and Sokal 1973). Typologies are derived either
through empirical analysis or conceptual formulation. Typologies offer a way of organizing
diversity, so that researchers can see patterns in complex phenomena. By isolating major

regardless of whether they then manage those businesses in innovative ways.

differences, typologies reduce the influences of confounding factors so that relationships can
be more clearly detected. Relationships may be found for particular subgroups that do not
apply to larger, pooled samples (Miller 1981; Hatten et al. 1978; Pinder and Moore 1979).
Well-defined sub-groups enhance the chances for replicating results across studies through
increasing the likelihood that samples can be drawn from intended sub-populations.
The process of classifying and labeling members of a population also shapes conceptual
thinking in the following ways. Typology derivation begins with the selection of classification
dimensions. This entails an explicit assessment of the theoretical and practical significance
of the chosen dimensions. Typologies are often defined along multiple dimensions, leading
to a more comprehensive or holistic understanding of the subject. Such “gestalts” capture
interdependencies
among attributes and presumably offer richer portrayals than a series of
adhoc descriptions of single variables. Appropriately labeled, typologies facilitate easy recall
and identification.
Thus, a group of entrepreneurs labeled as “craftsman entrepreneurs”
suggests a set of characteristics. Since properly derived typologies are intended to illuminate
the essential differences or major sources of variance across subjects, the resulting types
thus serve as explanatory or contingency variables in subsequent modeling efforts. As such,
they emerge as pivotal concepts around which data interpretation can be undertaken.
Typologies have occupied a central role in the study of strategy (Hambrick 1984;
Miller and Friesen 1977; Chrisman et al. 1988), organization (McKelvey 1975; Miller 1981;
Pinto and Pinder 1972; Pugh et al. 1969; Gartner et al. 1989), and environment (Hambrick
1983; Dubini 1989; Lawrence and Lorsch 1967). In a review of taxonomies, McKelvey
(1982) noted the contribution of classifications to the advancement of such disciplines as
Physics, Chemistry, Mineralogy, Zoology, and Botany.
Against this theoretical backdrop, let us consider some of the specific typologies that
have been developed and widely utilized in the field of entrepreneurship.

ENTREPRENEURIAL

TYPOLOGIES

The study of entrepreneurs would seem to be a logical area of application for classification
theory. Those who start businesses could be described by many attributes, including goals,
background variables, and management methods. Since entrepreneurs can vary along these
dimensions, it may be possible to cluster them into particular types, each consisting of
entrepreneurs who have particular combinations of attributes in common. In the tradition of
mid-range theory building, entrepreneurial
types have been employed to explain a wide
array of factors, which include performance of the entrepreneurial venture (Filley and Aldag
1980; Lafuente and Salas 1989), managerial practices (Lorraine and Dussault 1987), structure
of the firm (Filley and Aldag 1978), degree of innovation (Davidsson 1988), venture startup process (Dunkelberg and Cooper 1982), and even the entrepreneur’s perception of opportunities (Davidsson 1988). As shown above, entrepreneurial typologies seem to play a
central role in the developing literature on venture start-up, management, and subsequent
performance.
Research on entrepreneurial typologies is relatively recent, starting with Smith’s (1967)
study of 52 organizational founders. In recent years, there has been a growing amount of
work using the concept, with at least seven studies since 1977 (Braden 1977; Filley and
Aldag 1978; Dunkelberg and Cooper 1982; Smith and Miner 1983; Lorraine and Dussault
1987; Davidsson 1988; Lafuente and Salas 1989). As will be noted later, most of the early
studies formed typologies based upon a priori conceptual formulation. Some more recent
studies have been based upon multi-attribute empirical analysis.

<-----Page 4----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

TYPOLOGIES

97

In the work done to date, two predominant entrepreneurial types have emerged, often
termed “craftsmen” and “opportunists” (Smith 1967; Smith and Miner 1983; Lorraine and
Dussault 1987; Davidsson 1988). The findings suggest that craftsmen usually come from
blue-collar backgrounds with narrow educational and managerial experience. They preferred
technical work to administrative tasks and generally had primary motivations of “making a
comfortable living” (versus “making a lot of money”). They avoided risk-taking and were
less likely to seek multiple investors or partners. Businesses led by such individuals were
less adaptive to change and experienced lower growth.
By contrast, opportunists were characterized by broader experiences and higher levels
of education. They demonstrated a proclivity for managerial challenges and were more
oriented towards the future. They seemed more willing to change and exhibited greater
confidence in their ability to respond to the environment. Their organizations grew rapidly
while drawing on outside sources of funds and pursuing strategies that were diverse and
innovative. These entrepreneurs were more likely to be motivated by financial gains and the
opportunity for building a successful organization.
Though labeled differently, Braden’s
(1977) “caretakers” and “managers” essentially parallel the craftsmen-opportunists
classifications.
A number of other studies have resulted in more than two categories. Filley and Aldag
(1978) factor-analyzed
the attributes of entrepreneurs and their organizations along three
latent dimensions. These dimensions were labeled “craft,” “promotion,” and “administrative.” Managers and organizations with high “craft” scores resembled the craftsman type as
defined in earlier studies. Those with high “promotion” scores were formed to exploit
temporary opportunities. Growing rapidly, these organizations were loosely structured and
were highly oriented towards change. Characterized by higher degrees of task differentiation
and layers of hierarchy, organizations demonstrating high “administrative”
scores consisted
of larger, complex firms led by professional managers who adopted formal planning and
control systems.
Respondents in the Dunkelberg and Cooper (1982) study were divided into “craftsmen,”
“growth-oriented”
and “independent” entrepreneurs. The first two types resembled the craftsman-opportunist
categories in other studies. “Independents”
were mostly driven by a need
for personal autonomy. Though the latter experienced the highest growth rate among the
three groups, they had the least supervisor and work experience. They also had the highest
percentage with graduate school education. In a classification of Spanish entrepreneurs,
by the nature of
Lafuente and Salas (1989) identified four types: “craftsman’‘-motivated
the work; “family” entrepreneurs who placed a high priority on family welfare and meeting
a challenge; “managerial”
entrepreneurs who sought prestige and self-development;
and
“risk” entrepreneurs who demonstrated a strong preference for risk-taking. The first two
groups resembled “craftsman” entrepreneurs in earlier studies, whereas the last two demonstrated similar characteristics as “opportunists.”
In sum, the literature on entrepreneurial typologies provides consistent support for the
two dominant types, craftsmen and opportunists. Other types may exist although the profiles
generated thus far do not converge on a clearly defined third category. See “Appendix I”
for a summary of these studies.
Despite apparent agreement across studies, we should note that the typologies reported
to date rellect the idiosyncracies
of particular studies. Differences can be found in the
definitions of entrepreneurs, sample characteristics, methodologies, and variables employed.
One difference, which may be of fundamental importance, relates to the variables used in
the classification of entrepreneurs.
None of the studies on entrepreneurial
typologies has

<-----Page 5----->98

WOO ET AL.

employed the same set of criteria. There are overlaps and similarities but not full agreement
on this important choice. Furthermore, within the entrepreneurship literature, there has been
almost no explicit examination of the implications of the choice of divergent classification
variables, either for the forming of typologies or for the subsequent interpretation of differences across classifications. Thus, an increasing body of research has utilized entrepreneurial typologies without consideration of whether the methods used are substantially affecting the results.

CLASSIFICATION

CRITERIA USED IN PRIOR STUDIES

Braden’s (1977) classification of managers and caretakers was based on the entrepreneur’s
motivations for starting a company. Respondents chose one of four statements that best
described their intentions. These were “to provide you with steady employment,”
“to let
you do the kind of work you want to do, ” “to provide a moderate income for you and your
family,” and “to make you wealthy.” (Braden 1977, p. 54)
Lafuente and Salas (1989) also focused solely on the motivations of entrepreneurs. In
this study, entrepreneurs rated the importance of 12 objectives: opportunities to prove oneself;
produce something that is perfect; build up something; pursue a challenge; have variety and
adventure; allow for improvisation; help relatives; gain security; lead; work in a prestigious
company; develop oneself; and have high earnings.
Goal statements similar to those of Braden (1977) were also used in the classification
by Dunkelberg and Cooper (1982). In addition to these four goal variables, four additional
classification variables tapped the degrees of growth and also of change in the business, the
presence of formal controls, and how comfortable the entrepreneur felt with technical versus
managerial problems. Lorraine and Dussault (1987), in contrast, employed only two attrioutes: former education and past experience.
Relative to the above, a second group of analyses incorporated a much larger set of
criteria in their classifications. Smith (1967) as well as Smith and Miner (1983) incorporated
breadth in education and experience, social orientation (reference group, degree of social
involvement, and communication ability), management style, use of formal processes, functional strategies, and nature of competitive environment. Davidsson’s (1988) test of Smith’s
typology examined 17 characteristics similar to those just mentioned. Types derived by Filley
and Aldag (1978, 1980) were built on an even broader set of 45 to 55 characteristics. These
included goals, presence of formal systems and procedures, managerial style, attitudes toward
employees, and degree of anticipated change.
These studies examined above might be thought of as falling into two groups that
represent fundamentally different approaches to classification (McKelvey 1982, pp. 15-17).
The first group falls into the family of special classi’cations,
which is based on a small
number of attributes. This type of classification is useful in circumstances in which researchers
are interested in the implications of specific factors. Examples would be primary motivations
of the entrepreneur or amount of formal education. Thus, if entrepreneurs are classified
according to primary motivation, then the research can examine how other variables, such
as management style or performance, vary by these types.
The second group, known as general classijkations, defines types on the basis of a
comprehensive set of characteristics. Such classifications would be more suited to the derivation of generic types or representative profiles of the underlying population. General
classifications provide the integrated or holistics portrayals we would think of in a gestalt.

<-----Page 6----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

TYPOLOGIES

99

These classifications incorporate interdependencies
or interactions among all relevant attributes identified in the received theory of the field.
In the process of defining types, general classifications involve the assignment of nonzero weights to all potentially relevant dimensions. The contribution of each attribute to the
classification is determined within the empirical analysis. On the other hand, special classifications assign non-zero weights only to a few dimensions. As such, special classifications
“predetermine”
the contributions
of different attributes and “force” differentiation
among
population members to take place only along a highly restricted set of characteristics. For
example, if entrepreneurs are classified according to prior education, then typologies will
differ along this dimension. As such, special classifications carry a heavier burden of conceptualization and theoretical assessment of selected and omitted dimensions.
Two related outcomes should be noted. First, when a small number of criteria are
used to define groups, within group variances of these classification dimensions tend to be
low. For instance, if entrepreneurs are classified according to primary motivation, then the
entrepreneurs within each group would show little variance along this dimension. In the
extreme but not infrequent case, when each value of a categorical variable gives rise to a
group (such as having supervisory experience or not), within-group variances of that variable
would be zero. As more variables are introduced, tight within-group variances along the
classification criteria are harder to achieve. Measured on a multivariate basis, similarity
among members of the same group can be higher on some attributes and lower on others.
Members are not likely to exhibit identical values on all dimensions. Thus, if entrepreneurs
are classified according to several measures, such as primary motivation, education, and
management style, they would demonstrate some variance along each of these dimensions
within each group. As such, special classifications produce groups with a much higher degree
of homogeneity along the classification criteria than general classifications.
Second, we note that in either type of classification, omitted variables are allowed to
vary within each group and to do so in both positive and negative directions. Thus, in special
classifications, these attributes not used in the classification procedure are allowed to take
on diverse values within each group. General classifications, in contrast, seek homogeneity
among a large set of classification variables. The tradeoff between the two types of classifications is that tight within-group variances will be achieved on a small number of variables
in special classifications,
whereas a lesser degree of homogeneity will be obtained with a
larger set of variables in general classifications.
Without dispute, each type of classification serves a legitimate purpose. A problem
arises, however, when we fail to note the distinction between groups formed using these
different approaches. Extant practices associated with the formulation and interpretation of
entrepreneurial
typologies present such a danger. While both special and general classifications have been used, authors have not explicitly recognized these differences and the
implications of utilizing these different approaches. Types obtained in different analyses
were often given the common set of “opportunist-craftsman”
labels. No recognition was
explicitly directed at the conceptual implications of variables omitted from special classifications but incorporated in general classifications.
The magnitude of problems created by such divergent definitions is unclear. Logically,
one would expect the problem to be less serious when high correlations exist among all
relevant descriptors of entrepreneurs.
For instance, if virtually all entrepreneurs classified
as craftsmen because of their motivation also tended to have relatively low levels of education,
then entrepreneurs would be grouped in about the same way, regardless of which variable
was used for classification purposes. If researchers feel intuitively that certain variables tend

<-----Page 7----->100

WOO ET AL.

always to correlate together, they may conclude that the choice of classification variables
does not make a material difference. However, entrepreneurship
is a young field of study
and correlations among all potentially relevant attributes have not been examined extensively.
Moreover, we have no means of prescribing “problematically
low” levels of correlations
nor of predicting their consequences. Considering the evolving role occupied by typologies
in the conceptual development of the field of entrepreneurship,
it would be helpful to evaluate
these differences in an explicit and systematic manner. This study provides such an assessment.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Research Question
In the current study, evaluation of divergent entrepreneurial classification approaches revolves
around the central question: How would the use of different sets of classification variables
(variables already used in the extant literature) affect the groupings of entrepreneurs? If the
grouping of entrepreneurs is robust and not sensitive to the choice of classification variables,
then we need not be concerned about the considerable differences in approaches used in
prior research. However, if the classification procedures are not robust, then statistical
differences across types would vary depending upon what variables are used for classification
purposes. The following empirical analysis (which we think is the first of its kind) will
examine the statistical behavior of entrepreneurial
groups derived under different classifications. These tests will enable us to assess the degree of comparability between different
classification attempts and the extent to which findings on the “same” entrepreneurial type
can be integrated across studies.

Sample and Variable Definition
This research is based on what we believe to be the largest and most representative samples
of small businesses studied to date. A survey focusing on new businesses was administered
in May 1985 to members of the National Federation of Independent Businesses who reported
that they had recently become owners. Of the 4,814 entrepreneurs who responded, 2,994
had become owners no earlier than 1984, that is during the preceding 17 months. These
entrepreneurs, who might be considered as new business owners, had, on the average, been
in business for 11 months at the time of the first questionnaire. The sample included a crosssection of industries, geographic areas, and types of businesses. The initial questionnaires
solicited information on the entrepreneur’s background, motivations, prior training, nature
of business, start-up process, and the nature of their environment. A follow-up questionnaire
was mailed to the entrepreneurs one year later, in 1986. A total of 1,190 responded, reporting
subsequent developments and management practices, including one dimension that may be
particularly relevant to the development of entrepreneurial typologies, i.e., how they allocated their time. All of their businesses had achieved a degree of success, in the sense that
they survived to the time of the second questionnaire,
when the average business was 23
months old.
From the above sample, only businesses from the retail and personal services sectors
will be examined. This decision follows established precedence whereby authors either
examined one sector (Lorraine and Dussault 1987) or ran separate analyses for such groups
as retail and manufacturing
firms. Prior analysis of the data in this sample showed clear

<-----Page 8----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

TYPOLOGIES

101

differences across industries in such important characteristics as start-up size and entrepreneurial background, suggesting that it would be unwise to pool across industries. Retail and
personal services are similar, in that both involve selling to consumers, both involve serving
local or regional markets, and both involve lower barriers to entry (in terms of capital
requirements or professional training) than many of the other industry categories. Statistical
tests indicated that these two sectors had similar start-up size and demonstrated similar
management practices in terms of time allocated to managing employees, record keeping,
maintenance, cash management, and planning for future growth. The pooling of personal
services and retail firms was also undertaken in an earlier study by Vozikis and Glueck
(1980). The focus is thus upon retail and personal services firms, which made up about 65%
of the initial sample. After case-wise deletion of missing values across 2 years of responses,
the sample consisted of 5 10 entrepreneurs, all of whom had responded to both the first- and
second-year questionnaires.
In selecting the variables for this analysis, we note that the primary purpose of this
research is not to develop new variables by which entrepreneurs might be classified. Rather,
it is to determine whether the choice of classification variables makes a difference. Therefore,
to the extent possible, we adhered closely to the precedents set by the prior literature in the
choice of variables and the questions employed in operationalizing
these concepts. The
literature review and “Appendix I” showed that criteria used to date in classifying entrepreneurs can be grouped into three categories: (1) goals; (2) background in terms of education
and managerial experience; and (3) management style. These will be incorporated in this
study. The specific variables, their corresponding measures, and prior literature sources are
described below and summarized in Table 1.
Goals at the time of starting the business were based upon the relative rankings of the
following four motivations: (1) to let you do the kind of work you wanted to do; (2) to
avoid having to work for others; (3) to make more money than you would have otherwise;
and (4) to build a successful organization.* Education and experience reflected the highest
level of formal education and the highest level of supervisory responsibility attained by the
entrepreneur.3 Management style was based in part upon the extent of agreement of the
following statements: (I) “In my business, operating controls and methods are in writing,”
and (2) “I am most comfortable in selling or handling technical problems rather than working
on management issues.“4 In addition, management style was based upon responses to the
question of how the entrepreneur allocated his or her time.5
As we consider the effect of moving from special classifications to more general ones,
three classifications
(A, B, C) will be performed employing a hierarchical structure of
classification dimensions as shown in the following:

Time allocation priorities were examined in studies by Farmer (1978) and Van de Ven et al. (1984).

These three schemes progress from a narrow set (special classification) to a broad
scheme with all three classes of characteristics included (general classification). This structure
parallels what we observe in the literature, which yields types defined only on the basis of
the entrepreneur’s start-up intentions in some studies (Braden 1977; Lafuente and Salas 1988)
to types that are formed from diverse characteristics in others (Smith and Miner 1983; Filley
and Aldag 1978). Excluded in this analysis are measures of the entrepreneur’s social ori-

entation, communication
ability, or propensity toward risk-taking. Though these have been
used in some prior studies, they were not as frequently employed and have not represented
critical points of departure in the definition of typologies. As such, we will examine the
impact upon classifications of the three major groups of variables to maintain some degree
of focus and keep the task of interpretation at a manageable level of complexity.

Methodology
In the development of each of the classifications, cluster analyses were performed to derive
types. Three sets of dimensions as depicted previously in Classifications A, B, and C were
used. The analysis employed the Ward method, a common hierarchical clustering algorithm.
(Anderberg 1973; Lot-r 1983) The Ward method merges two clusters, which results in the
smallest increase in the overall sum of squared within-cluster distances. The sum comprises
all distances from each case in the cluster to the centroid of the cluster. The implied distance
measure employed by this method is the squared Euclidean distance. Variables were first
standardized to eliminate the differences in scales of measurement.
Determination
of the appropriate number of groups or types is a key but arbitrary
decision in cluster analysis. Guidance is provided by the increase in within-cluster distances
as groups are merged. Relatively large increases signify the merging of less similar clusters.
Despite such indications, the decision is largely subjective in nature (Arnold 1979; Harrigan
1985). No parametric statistics are available to indicate the degree of “significant” increase.
Moreover, all increases tend to be quite large when a small number of clusters remains in
the final stages of the analyses. This decision must then be made with strong prior theoretical
assessment. In this analysis, we select the two-cluster solution as the basis of comparison
across the three classification schemes. This choice explicitly builds on the extant literature,
which has converged on two major types of entrepreneurs: craftsmen and opportunists. If
the population can indeed be classified into these two generic types, then a two-cluster
solution should generate groups that mirror the characteristics of each of these types.
Two-cluster solutions were obtained for the three separate classifications, moving from
the most “specific” classification scheme (A-based
upon goals only) to the most “general”
basis of classification (C-based
upon multiple criteria). For each pair of clusters obtained
under each classification (A, B, and C), cluster means were computed for all variables; rtests were used to compare the variable means between each pair of clusters under each of
three classifications (Table 2). Group memberships resulting from the three different classifications are also cross-tabulated in Table 3.

RESULTS
Refer to Table 2 for results on the three classifications.

Classtication

A: Classification Based on Goals

Under Classification A, the two groups (designated here as Groups 1 and 2) differed in a
statistically significant manner along the goal variables, which was the only set of criteria
used. All four goal variables were significant at the CY= 0.01 level. This is not surprising
since these variables were used as the basis for classification. The two groups did not differ
along any of the education/experience
variables. Of the 11 management-type
descriptors,
only three were significant. Based on the goal characterisitics,
Group 1 can be thought of

as “independents”
who placed a high priority on not having to work for others. In contrast,
the second group was motivated by the chance to build a successful organization.
These
“organization builders” were more likely to adopt formal controls and documentation
(opcontrl), to spend less time on direct provision of services (TA4), and to devote more time
to cash and financial management (TA7).

Classification B: Classification Based on Goals and Background
When background variables depicting education and management experience were added in
this classification, the entrepreneurs were reclassified into two new groups (designated here
as Groups 3 and 4). Statistical differences between types did not resemble results obtained
under Classification A. All four background indicators now yielded significant differences
between the two types. Only one goal variable was significant (makernon). In addition, two
management variables were also statistically different between the two groups.
The two groups in Classification B can best be distinguished by education level and
prior management experience. None of the Group 3 members reported any form of graduate
education or prior supervisory experience. Group 4 members, on the other hand, tended to
have reached a higher level of achievement on both counts. Group 3 members, however,
were more likely to have owned a prior business. They expressed a stronger preference for
technical problem-solving
over administrative work (techprob) and spent less time on planning for growth (TA8). The label “craftsman” is given to Group 3 as we consider the
education and style characteristics of these entrepreneurs. Note however that Group 3 members did not show particularly high preferences for craftsman-related goals such as autonomy
or doing the type of work they like to do. (This point will be discussed later.) Group 4
members resembled the “administrative”
type derived by Filley and Aldag (1978). Thus
Group 4 is labeled “administrative.”

Classifuxtion C: Classification Based on Goals, Background,
and Management Style
Classification C, involving multiple criteria, resulted in Groups 5 and 6. Group differences
changed only moderately as we moved from Classification B to C. All the background
variables remained significant. Directions on these differences were also consistent with the
prior classification. The two groups still differed in the likelihood of having had graduate
training, management experience, and prior ownership of another business. The group with
lower education and management background was again characterized by a stronger incli-

<-----Page 13----->106

nation towards technical problems (techprob). They also spent less time dealing with employees (TAl). Time spent on planning (TAS) was no longer significant. Groups 5 and 6
were given the same respective labels as Groups 3 and 4.

Cross-Tabulation

of Group Memberships

In developing typologies, an important question is the extent to which individuals exhibit
stable membership across different classifications.
We thus examine the membership of
individual entrepreneurs within each typology and note how that changes as we move from
special to general classifications. If the overlap between classifications is strong, then we
should observe a one-on-one mapping, i.e., entrepreneurs who cluster together under classification A would also cluster together under classification B. To illustrate, the majority of
Group 1 entrepreneurs (from Classification A) should map onto either Group 3 or Group 4
(from Classification B) but they should not be divided across both. Group 2 should then
map onto the remaining group. Similar comparisons would be made between Classifications
A and C, and B and C.
Table 3 shows that Classification A failed to show the type of one-on-one mapping
described earlier with Classifications B and C. Group 3 from Classification B became the
“home” of Groups 1 and 2 (81% and 83%). Similarly, Group 5 from Classification C
contained 90% and 93% of Groups 1 and 2 members. (Note that Groups 3 and 5 are both
very large, reflecting the fact that most of the entrepreneurs had no graduate education.)
Entrepreneurs originally classified into Groups 1 or 2 of Classification A thus showed little
tendency to cluster together in the groups formed under Classifications B or C. Classifications
B and C showed a high degree of overlap, with 100% of Group 3 members appearing in
Group 5. However, Group 4 was almost equally divided between Group 5 (53%) and Group
6 (47%).

DISCUSSION
The analysis showed that different classification criteria produced different groupings of
entrepreneurs.
Although this may not be surprising from a methodological
standpoint, it
does raise a number of basic questions about the universality and validity of entrepreneurial
types as they have been formulated in the extant literature. The concerns do not pertain to
each previous study taken singularly. Rather, they challenge the strong degree of perceived
agreement across entrepreneurial
classifications.
This, in turn, has implications for interpretation of prior research.
First, the results in Table 2 demonstrate that group differences obtained in special
classifications did not retain their statistical significance when the number of criteria was
expanded. Hence, the derivation of entrepreneurial types does not appear to be robust with
respect to the choice of typing criteria. The differences were particularly pronounced when
the goal variables were supplemented by background indicators. The addition of management
style variables to background indicators did not result in as large a difference. The results
in Table 3 show that individual entrepreneurs often shift group membership as classification
variables are added.
Note that differences observed in the current analysis would likely be amplified across
studies. Our research design retained the same sample, survey instrument, variable definitions, and methodology across classifications.
The only variation was in the choice of
clustering criteria. The latter were introduced in a hierarchical manner where A was a subset

<-----Page 14----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

TYPOLOGIES

107

of B, and B a subset of C. Across other studies, differences would exist in sample selection,
survey design, data collection, variable operationalization,
and methodology. Typing criteria
would not be monotonically nested as in the three classifications in this study. These factors
strongly raise doubt as to the likelihood of obtaining similar types across studies. Very
likely, similar labels may have been attached to divergent entities.
The analysis also yielded an unexpected outcome that pertains to the craftsmanwe did not obtain the clear-cut
opportunist distinction.
Across the three classifications,
tradeoffs in goals, which characterize opportunists and craftsmen. As described in the literature, opportunists are motivated by financial success and the chance to build a successful
enterprise. Craftsmen, in direct contrast, pursue independence and the chance to work in a
problem area of personal interest. If this characterization is correct, we should see one group
placing high rankings on success, both financial and organizational,
and low rankings on
autonomy and doing what they want to do. The reverse would be true for the other group.
This tradeoff should be most observable in Classification A, where goals were the
only classification variables. Yet, even in this context, we failed to obtain such a differentiation. (Note that individual respondents were asked to rank the relative importance of
the goals, so that they could not place equal importance on more than one goal.) Even so,
the average rankings in Group 1 were about the same for three of the four goals: “doing the
type of work you wanted,” “making more money,” and “building a successful organization.”
In Group 2, the most emphasized goals were those for “doing the type of work you wanted”
Neither group showed the clear-cut trade-offs in
and “building a successful organization.”
goals that one might have expected. This pattern was repeated under Classification B and
C. Hence, it appeared that financial and personal motivations were simultaneous rather than
mutually exclusive driving forces.
The question raised here is not one of the existence of craftsmen and opportunists
types as depicted in the received theory of the field. Rather, we query how representative
these may be in describing the population of entrepreneurs.
Do these types capture the
majority or only a small fraction of entrepreneurs? Are these the only two clusters or two
among many clusters? Do these represent perhaps the extremes or the most archtypical
groups of entrepreneurs?
Prior studies provide some clues to these questions. A number of authors selected
solutions that led to more than two clusters: Filley and Aldag (1978), Dunkelberg and Cooper
(1982), and Lafuente and Salas (1989). While only the last of these employed cluster analysis,
all three studies demonstrated the same point-that
two groups might not be sufficient for
describing their samples. Even though Davidsson (1988) supported Smith’s two types of
entrepreneurs, the author specifically pointed out that a three-group solution would be better.
Certain studies assigned points or factor scores to entrepreneurs and classified into groups
those that were at the high or low ends of the distributions (Smith 1967; Filley and Aldag
1978). Those in the middle were not labeled or included in further analysis. In these cases,
only a portion of the businesses were classified into the two groups. This study showed that,
when a two-cluster solution was used to group all entrepreneurs,
the resulting profiles of
the two groups did not match well with the two generic types (craftsmen and opportunist)
described in the literature.
It is clear that there is a great deal of diversity among entrepreneurs. Goals, background
variables, and management styles do not cluster as tightly or as consistently as we might
have expected. This means that typologies are sensitive to the classification criteria chosen
and that the often-used craftsman-opportunist
typology may only have limited applicability.
There are a number of implications for researchers:

<-----Page 15----->108

WOO ET AL.

1. Unless care has been used in the choice of classification variables, it may be that hypotheses are being generated from one set of typologies and then tested with data from
other typologies that differ in important ways. (Even though the same titles may be used,
the typologies may differ because of the classification variables chosen.)
2. Our ability to replicate other researchers’ findings may be hampered. This in turn hinders
the accumulation and cross-validation of a critical mass of knowledge.
3. Findings may be generalized in inappropriate ways. For example goal differences found
in special classifications and in smaller samples have been extended to the population at
large and presumed to represent critical universal tradeoffs.
4. As these generalizations become widely accepted, they shape the conceptual frameworks
that guide the process of hypothesis development and data collection. To the extent that
we do not anticipate any additional categories, survey instruments would not systematically allow for the identification of other types, and model specifications would not
unveil the true effects of types.
Noting these concerns,

our recommendations

to researchers

suggest the following:

1. Research focused on the derivation of typologies must offer a strong theoretical framework
for the choice of selected as well as omitted entrepreneurial characteristics. If classification
of entrepreneurs had been found to be robust, then choices of criteria would not have a
pronounced effect on the relationships being examined. A broader range would have
been available for experimentation
and idiosyncratic preferences. However, it is clear
that typologies are very sensitive to the classification criteria chosen. Given the inconsistencies underlying the derivation of types and the absence of strong theoretical priors,
we may first have to examine the impact of specific entrepreneurial
characteristics on
performance, the degrees of variation within the population of entrepreneurs,
and the
conceptual implications for classification.
This procedure lays the foundation for the
construction of typologies that may be similar to or different from those developed to
this point. In addition to explicit selection of criteria, the number of groups selected as
a solution and the observations dropped from classifications should be clearly reported
and appraised.
2. With respect to the choice of group structure, researchers would naturally seek to apply
constructs used in the past. However, we should recognize the limitations of the widely
accepted and seemingly safe two-group solution. Stronger consideration should be given
to alternative structures or additional categories even though these have not been clearly
identified or consistently supported in the past. Researchers must highlight the decision
rules they employ, the percentage of their samples not classified, and the nature of these
“middle of the road’ entrepreneurs.
3. For those who employ the entrepreneurial type as a predictor of strategy and performance
in young firms, one must pay close attention to the differences across prior studies and
how these may bear on the development of hypotheses. The positive correlations among
type, strategy, and performance reported in the past do not necessarily reveal the same
relationships.
Thus, statements about typology-performance
linkages may reflect the
relationships between goals and performance, background and performance, or management style and performance.
What are the implications for practice? Entrepreneurial typologies have seemed to be
a useful way of thinking about entrepreneurs.
Thus, entrepreneurs who engage in selfassessment and those who provide resources and advice to other entrepreneurs need to have
ways of anticipating problems and predicting performance. It would be convenient to think

<-----Page 16----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

TYPOLOGIES

109

of entrepreneurs being classified into two primary types with a predictable set of experiences,
problems, strengths, and probabilities of success. An increasing body of literature has
certainly encouraged the adoption of such generic profiles. The potential of the existing
craftsman-opportunist
framework appeared very strong in that it seemed to shed light on a
wide range of behavior. However, the work presented here suggests that the world may be
more complicated. While the craftsmanopportunist
classification appears to serve as a useful
dimension, its applicability and predictive capability may have been exaggerated to this
point. Thus, in the future, we may be able to develop useful typologies that enable us to
see patterns, to anticipate problems, and to predict performance. However, at our present
stage of understanding
it is better to recognize that there is great diversity, and that only
some entrepreneurs fit the idealized “craftsman” and “opportunist” classifications.

LIMITATIONS
This study is limited in execution and focus. While the sample is one of the largest to date,
it includes only owner-managers of new firms. In terms of methodology, this study employed
only the Ward method of clustering. While Ward is a frequently used method, it would be
helpful to examine the impact of classification criteria across other hierarchical and nonhierarchical clustering algorithms. Similarly, the distance measure could be expanded from
the squared Euclidean distance to other indicators. The clustering solution chosen was the
two-group structure and did not examine the impact of divergent classification criteria in
cluster solutions with more than two groups.
In terms of focus, this study examined only one dimension of the classification problem.
Other factors also contribute to the validity of typologies. One issue is the temporal stability
of types. Do group members retain the same characteristics over time? If they do change,
do group members evolve in the same direction? To what degree is that direction predictable
from current group membership?
While this study focuses on the influence of divergent classification criteria, it did not
provide an appraisal of the appropriateness
and relative importance of different criteria.
Should goals, background characteristics,
and management practices be used in the first
place? Another key question pertains to the degree of homogeneity within type. For typologies
to be useful, members within one group must demonstrate greater homogeneity with each
other than with members in other groups. Yet within each group, members are not completely
identical. To what degree can members vary and still be classified as one group? Hence,
even though we demonstrated the outcomes of different classification criteria, we have only
addressed one part of a much bigger challenge.
SUMMARY
We note that entrepreneurship
is a young field of study. As such, the common language
that gives rise to pattern recognition, theory building, and hypothesis testing is still developing. Typology constitutes part of this language. In this respect, this study suggests that
extreme caution must be exercised as we interpret previous findings on entrepreneurial types.
Though significant agreement appears to link different studies, divergencies may be hiding
underneath similar labels. Moreover, direct comparisons are often not possible given the
different methodologies and instruments employed across studies. Craftsmen-opportunist
classifications may be highly convenient ways of anchoring our classifications and descriptions of entrepreneurs, yet the polarity inherent in such a distinction was not supported on

<-----Page 17----->110

a large sample. This analysis does not call into question prior studies on an individual basis.
Rather, it challenges the conclusion that, in aggregate, we have succeeded in classifying
the population of entrepreneurs into two robust categories with, by and large, consistent
differences across categories. Given the central role of classification in the theoretical development of entrepreneurial behavior and performance, it is important that close examination
be given to this critical subject.
