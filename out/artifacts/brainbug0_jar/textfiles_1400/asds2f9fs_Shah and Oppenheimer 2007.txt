Easy does it: The role of fluency in cue weighting

Abstract
We propose that people weight fluent, or easy to process, information more heavily than disfluent information when
making judgments. Cue fluency was manipulated independent of objective cue validity in three studies, the findings
from which support our hypothesis. In Experiment 1, participants weighted a consumer review more heavily when it
was written in a clear font than in a less clear font. In Experiment 2, participants placed more weight on information
when it was in focus than when it was blurry. In Experiment 3, participants placed more weight on financial information
from brokerage firms with easy to pronounce names than those with hard to pronounce names. These studies demonstrate
that fluency affects cue weighting independent of objective cue validity.

Introduction

When making judgments and decisions, people have numerous pieces of information (i.e., cues) available to aid
in the decision process. When deciding whether a patient
has diabetes, a doctor might examine the patient’s symptoms, family health history, or lab results. A stockbroker
might consider companies’ profit margins, quarterly projections, and recent activity. A judge or jurist might consider testimony from several witnesses and various other
pieces of evidence. With so much information available,
how do we decide which cues to weight most heavily?
Conventional models suggest that decision-makers
should weight information based on objective cue validity. According to normative principles such as the
weighted additive (Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993),
additive difference (Tversky, 1969), and weighted averaging models (Himmelfarb, 1970), people should consider all of the available cues that might inform a particular judgment. They should then differentially weight each
cue based upon how successfully the cue predicts the outcome. However, this approach cannot perfectly explain
how naïve decision-makers, who are unaware of cue validities, might make judgments or decisions. Nor can it
explain how people’s judgments often result from overweighting less valid information (Tversky & Kahneman,

1974). Given that learning cue validities can be time consuming and inaccurate (Gluck & Bower, 1988; Goodie
& Crooks, 2004; Himmelfarb, 1970; Peterson & Pitz,
1985), we propose that people might use a cue’s fluency,
or the ease with which it is processed, as an additional
basis for weighting cues. A fluency-based account of cue
weighting does not require decision-makers to know objective cue validities. Instead, this explanation highlights
a rather simple tendency: placing more weight on information that feels easy to process.

1.1 Fluency and its Applications to Cue
Weighting
Many different factors can affect subjective feelings of
ease, or fluency. For instance, perceptual fluency refers to
the ease with which a stimulus can be perceived (Jacoby,
Woloshyn, & Kelley, 1989). Retrieval fluency refers to
the ease with which information can be brought to mind
or recalled from memory (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman,
1973). Other types of fluency include conceptual fluency
(Whittlesea, 1993), linguistic fluency (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2006; Oppenheimer, 2006; Whittlesea & Leboe,
2000), and embodied fluency (Stepper & Strack, 1993;
for a review of different processes that engender fluency,
see Alter & Oppenheimer, 2007).
Broadly speaking, fluency can affect judgment and
decision-making directly or indirectly. When fluency directly affects judgments, the ease of processing itself acts
as a piece of information that can be weighted and applied
to a judgment. A prominent example of direct fluency effects is the availability heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman,
1973, 1974), by which people judge easy-to-recall events
to be more likely to occur in the future. Jacoby and Dallas

371

<-----Page 1----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 2, No. 6, December 2007

(1981) have also shown how processing fluency might directly affect judgments, where people are more likely to
say that they have seen easy-to-read words before in the
context of a recognition task.
When fluency indirectly affects judgments, the ease of
processing might determine which cues people attend to,
and the strategies they use to weight and integrate the
information contained in those cues. That is, fluency is
not itself used as a cue for judgment, but instead manipulates which strategies or cues are used to confront
a task. These strategies and other pieces of information
in turn affect the final judgment. For example, Alter,
Oppenheimer, Epley, and Eyre (2007) found that participants who solved math and reasoning tasks were more
likely to engage in systematic processing when they experienced disfluency, and heuristic processing when they
experienced fluency. Note that the feelings of ease were
not used as pieces of information that could be used to
solve the math problems. Instead, fluency affected which
strategies were used to answer the questions and these
strategies in turn determined the final answers. This
demonstrates how fluency might indirectly affect judgment by first leading people to adopt a particular strategy.
In this paper, we aim to extend the literature on how
fluency might indirectly affect judgment. Specifically, we
demonstrate that people’s cue-weighting strategies depend on a cue’s fluency. That is, people weight fluent
cues more heavily than disfluent cues. This prediction
stems from a review of the literature on heuristics which
shows that people often heavily weight cues that are easier to access (Shah & Oppenheimer, in press). For instance, people might use audience responsiveness as a
cue for speaker/message persuasiveness (Axsom, Yates,
& Chaiken, 1987), feelings of outrage as a cue for deciding punishment (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002), brand
name as a cue for product quality (Maheswaran, Mackie,
& Chaiken, 1992), or attractiveness as a cue for familiarity (Monin, 2003). Proposed heuristics such as these
quietly converge on an underlying domain-general mechanism in which cues that are easy to process or retrieve
are weighted more heavily than other cues. However, to
date this mechanism has not been studied directly.
There are also other reasons that fluency emerges as
a strong candidate for a mechanism underlying cueweighting. Such a mechanism makes sense given limited
cognitive resources (Simon, 1955). Using cues which
are easy to access will reduce the demands placed on
decision-makers. Additionally, decision-makers might
use fluency as the basis for cue weighting because they
believe that more fluent cues are more valid. For example, Reber and Schwarz (1999) showed that more fluent
statements are judged to be truer than less fluent statements. Additionally, Unkelbach (2006, 2007) has shown
that the more strongly fluency is correlated with truth in a

Fluency and cue weighting

372

particular experimental setting, the stronger the inferred
relationship between fluency and truth. As such, fluency
could be used as a basis for cue weighting because fluency and objective validity might actually be correlated
in the real world. It may then be the case that more fluent cues are subjectively seen as more valid, allowing for
decision-makers to use fluency as a basis for cue weighting when objective validity information is absent or difficult to access.
To understand how fluency and validity might be correlated, consider a basic associative learning framework.
From this framework, we can surmise that, whenever a
decision-maker experiences an event in the presence of
a cue, there is some probability that an association between the event and the cue will be learned. Cues that are
seen more often in the presence of the event will become
more strongly associated with the event. When decisionmakers later make judgments about the event, cues will
be differentially primed based on their associations with
the event. That is, cues that are more strongly associated
with the event, will be easier to access when making judgments about the event. Since one consequence of priming is an increase in fluency (Stark & McClelland, 2000),
there will be a reliable relationship between the fluency
of a cue and the objective validity of the cue.
Although cue fluency and objective validity might be
correlated, they are separable concepts. For example,
making a stimulus easier to perceive by increasing figureground contrast need not affect how accurately this stimulus predicts an outcome. Consequently, fluency can
be manipulated separately from objective cue validity,
allowing us to identify its unique contributions to cueweighting behavior.
In the remainder of this paper we describe three studies in which fluency affects how people weight cues. In
all three studies fluency was manipulated independently
of validity. In Experiment 1, participants priced an MP3
player based on product specifications and a negative
consumer review. The consumer review was presented
in either fluent or disfluent font. Participants weighted
the consumer review more heavily if it was presented in
a more fluent font. In Experiment 2, participants rated
political lobbying firms based on brief recommendations
from reviewers. These recommendations were a part of
graphic logos that were either fluent or disfluent. As expected, participants weighted information from fluent images more than from disfluent images. In Experiment 3,
participants made ratings about stocks based on evaluations from brokerage firms that were either fluently or disfluently named. Participants weighted information from
the fluently named brokerage firms more heavily. These
three studies demonstrate that perceptual fluency and linguistic fluency both affect how people select and weight
cues when making judgments.

Experiment 1

In this study participants indicated how much they believed an MP3 player should cost based on two types of
information: product specifications and a consumer review. Holding the fluency and content of the product
specifications constant, we used easy-to-read and hardto-read fonts to manipulate the perceptual fluency of the
consumer review. We expected that participants would
weight the consumer review more heavily when it was
fluent than when it was disfluent.

2.1
2.1.1

Method
Participants

One hundred eight people participated in the study.
Twenty-eight participants completed the survey as part of
a larger packet of questionnaires and received $10 compensation. The remaining eighty participants were recruited from a train station in Princeton Junction, NJ.
2.1.2

Design, stimuli, and procedure

Participants were asked to rate how much they thought
an MP3 player should cost (between $0 and $300) based
on its specifications and a negative consumer review. The
specifications, consumer review, and rating scale were all
contained on the same page. The specifications were held
constant, while the fluency of the consumer review was
manipulated. The fluent consumer review was presented
in black 12-pt Times New Roman font, while the disfluent
consumer review was presented in grey 12-pt italicized
Monotype Corsiva font (see Appendix A for a scaled version of the survey and font types).
Our purpose behind using a negative consumer review
was twofold. First, we wanted to demonstrate that fluency was not directly affecting judgment, but that it was
instead affecting how people weighted information before making a judgment. Second, we wanted to rule
out the possibility that mood states were also influencing judgments. If fluency were directly affecting people’s
judgment, then we might expect mood states to mediate
this effect (Winkielman, Schwarz, Reber, & Fazendeiro
, 2003; Zajonc, 1968). Both direct-influence and affective accounts predict that participants in this study would
price the MP3 player lower in the disfluent condition than
in the fluent condition; either because the disfluency is
a direct cue for a lack of quality, or because disfluency
creates negative affect which in turns leads to lower evaluations. However, we predict that if fluency indirectly
affects judgment, participants will price the MP3 player
higher in the disfluent condition because they will place
less weight on the negative disfluent cue.1

are using the term “cue” rather loosely here. We define any

Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the
disfluent consumer review condition, and half were randomly assigned to the fluent consumer review condition.
The data from nine participants were excluded from the
analysis because these participants either did not answer
the question or they provided a price that was out of the
specified price range.

2.2 Results and discussion
As expected, participants who read a fluent consumer
review priced the MP3 player significantly lower (M =
$126.29, SE = 11.70) than did participants who read a disfluent consumer review (M = $162.06, SE = 11.90, t(97)
= 2.14, p = .035, Cohen’s d = .43).
The results suggest that participants weighted fluent information more heavily than disfluent information. That
is, fluency indirectly affected the judgments. This study
also enables us to rule out the possibility that mood
changes are driving these effects. If the disfluency were
leading to negative affect and this mood change were altering the judgments, then disfluent consumer reviews
should have led to lower evaluations of the MP3 player’s
price. This was not the case. Instead, participants priced
the MP3 player higher in the disfluent condition, indicating that they were not weighting the negative consumer
review as heavily. This alternative explanation therefore
appears weaker, and the findings more clearly support the
hypothesis that fluency affects how people weight cues.
This study did suffer from a few limitations, however.
First, the consumer review did not provide a concise evaluation that can be represented on a clear scale (such as
number of gigabytes or hours of battery life). Given
the length of the review, it is possible that participants
in the disfluent condition simply did not read the entire
consumer review. Additionally, fluency was manipulated
only between subjects and so it remains unclear as to
whether participants would still weight fluent cues more
heavily if they were exposed to both fluent and disfluent cues. To address these limitations, we used withinsubjects fluency manipulations in the remaining studies
and used cues containing more concise information.

3 Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, participants were given several pieces of
background information about a fictional lobbying group,
information that should be weighted in the decision as a cue. The
consumer review contains several pieces of information, each of which
might be individually referred to as cues. For instance, it contains information about the durability of the product and specific problems. We
recognize that the consumer review contains several cues, but expect
that all of them will be weighted less heavily when the review is disfluent than when it is fluent.

as well as information from two fabricated ratings indices
for evaluating lobbying groups. These ratings indices
were presented as images, and fluency was manipulated
by darkening and blurring the images. Participants predicted the quality of the lobbying groups, and weighted a
fluently presented rating more heavily than a disfluently
presented rating.

3.1
3.1.1

Method
Participants

One hundred thirty-nine Princeton University students
and staff members were recruited from the campus center.
They completed the survey as part of a packet of questionnaires and received $12 compensation.
3.1.2

Design, stimuli, and procedure

Participants were given a brief description of how some
political lobbying groups operate. They were then asked
to rate the quality of one fictional lobbying firm. Participants were given background information for the lobbying firm (location, number of employees, and the percentage of employees who once worked in Congress), which
was held constant across all conditions.
Participants were also told that the industry often relies on two rating indices when evaluating the strength of
lobbying groups — the Rose and Stone indices. The Rose
index gave numeric ratings and the Stone index gave semantic ratings. We used different modalities for ratings
so as to discourage the simple strategy of averaging the
ratings from each index. For each index, we constructed
graphical logos which contained the rating scores given
for the lobbying group. Participants were told that these
indices typically agree in their evaluations, but sometimes
disagree. The indices shown to participants disagreed;
when one index gave the lobbying firm a high rating, the
other index gave a low rating. The assignment of high
and low ratings to each index was counterbalanced across
participants.
We manipulated the fluency of the cues (i.e., rating index logos) such that in the disfluent condition the logos
were darkened and slightly blurred, while in the fluent
condition the logos were left light and focused (see Figure 1 for sample stimuli). Half of the participants saw
logos such that the fluent cue gave a high rating, and half
of the participants saw logos such that the disfluent cue
gave a high rating. The data from 11 participants were
excluded from the analysis because these participants did
not answer all of the questions.
Participants were asked to rate the quality of the lobbying groups along three dimensions. First, participants
were asked to rate how good the lobbying firm was on a

Fluency and cue weighting

374

scale of 1 (low) to 100 (high). Second, participants predicted how much money a lobbying firm would win from
Congress if it was hired to win $2 million. Third, participants rated how likely they would be to recommend
this lobbying firm on a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 6
(very likely). The z-scores for these ratings were calculated, and the three ratings proved to be internally consistent (Cronbach’s alpha = .67). As such, the z-scores were
averaged for each response to form a composite quality
rating. If fluency affects cue weighting, then we would
expect participants to rate firms as better when the fluent
cue gives a high rating, compared to when the disfluent
cue gives a high rating.

3.2 Results and discussion
When analyzing the data, we combined cases where the
fluent cue gave a high rating, regardless of whether that
cue was the Rose or Stone index.2 Similarly, we combined cases where the disfluent cue gave a high rating.
As predicted, participants who saw fluent cues give high
ratings rated the lobbying firms as significantly better (M
= .15, SE = .09) than did participants who saw disfluent
cues give high ratings (M = -.15, SE = .10, t(126) = 2.15,
p = .03, Cohen’s d = .39).
These results provide additional support for the hypothesis that fluency indirectly affects judgment, with
participants placing more weight on fluent cues compared
to disfluent cues. Moreover, this experiment replicates
the above findings with a within-subjects fluency manipulation, indicating that people will weight fluent cues more
heavily even when they are exposed to multiple pieces of
information, some of which are more fluent than others.
Additionally, given that the information presented was
extremely concise, it is unlikely that participants were
simply not reading through or retaining the information
presented.
In these two studies, we manipulated the ease with
which information could be read without manipulating
objective cue validity. Although objective validity is not
affected by fluency, participants’ subjective impressions
of validity may have been affected by cue fluency. A
quick test of this hypothesis suggests that fluency does
indeed affect subjective impressions of validity. In a separate session, seventy-five participants completed a similar
task as that described above. However, instead of rating
the lobbying group, participants rated how accurate they
thought the different rating firms were. Responding on
a four-point scale, these participants believed firms with
2 It should be noted that the Rose index always conveyed numeric
information, while the Stone index always conveyed semantic information. Numeric information was weighted somewhat more heavily than
semantic information overall. However, for each index the expected
trend is evident: fluent information is weighted more heavily than disfluent information.

fluent logos to be more accurate (M = 3.32, SE = .09)
than firms with disfluent logos (M = 2.30, SE = .14), accounting for unequal variances (t(61.83) = 5.93, p < .001,
Cohen’s d = 1.38). This provides evidence for the hypothesis that fluency may affect cue weighting by altering
subjective impressions of cue validity.
Although these studies provide strong support for our
hypothesis, they are still limited to perceptual fluency. To
make inferences about subjective feelings of ease in general, it is necessary to investigate other fluency manipulations as well. In Experiment 3, we find support for our
hypothesis from the domain of linguistic fluency, or the
ease with which words can be pronounced.

Experiment 3

In this experiment, we investigated whether linguistic fluency might also affect cue weighting (for examples of linguistic fluency manipulations, see Alter & Oppenheimer,
2006; Whittlesea & Leboe, 2000). Participants rated
stocks along several dimensions based on a series of cues.
Target cues were either easy to pronounce or difficult to
pronounce. Ultimately, easier to pronounce cues were
weighted more heavily than more difficult to pronounce
cues.

4.1
4.1.1

Method
Participants

One hundred forty-four members of the Princeton University community (median age = 21) were recruited to
complete the survey as part of an online questionnaire.

They were compensated with entry into a lottery to win
one of several gift certificates.
4.1.2 Design, stimuli, and procedure
Participants read about a fictitious stock with a series of
cues that could be used for rating the stock’s growth potential. Three of the cues were uninformative decoys (location of headquarters, date that the stock went public,
and number of employees) and were held constant. The
remaining two cues were stock evaluations from two fictional brokerage firms.
The fluency of the brokerage firms’ names was manipulated within-subjects. However, we believed that it
might be possible for participants to think that disfluent
names reflected negatively on a company if there was no
reason for the name to be disfluent. For example, participants might believe that a hard to pronounce name was
indicative of a poorly managed brokerage firm. Such confounds would make it difficult for us to isolate the effects
of fluency. To avoid this problem, we told participants
that they were rating Turkish stocks and that the brokerage firms were also Turkish. Given that these were foreign brokerage firms, participants could naturally expect
some names to be difficult to pronounce.
To manipulate the fluency of the brokerage firms’
names, we used Turkish names that were shown in a
pretest to be highly disfluent or highly fluent. In the
pretest, a separate pool of 31 participants were asked to
rate how easy it would be to pronounce different names
on a scale of 1 (very easy) to 10 (very difficult). From
175 tested names, we selected the eight most fluent (M =
2.74, SE = .03) and eight most disfluent (M = 6.87, SE =
.15), making up eight pairs of fluent/disfluent names (see
Appendix B for a list of the names used).

<-----Page 5----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 2, No. 6, December 2007

To make direct comparisons between the two cues
more difficult, the information from the cues was given in
different formats: letter grades versus linguistic descriptions. Cue fluency and information format were counterbalanced. A description of the cues was provided for
the participants. The two key cues were described as
“the [brokerage firm name] rating evaluates each stock
along a verbal scale, ranging from ‘Very Low’ (poor stock
choice) to ‘Very High’ (good stock choice)” and “the
[brokerage firm name] rating gives letter grades to each
stock, ranging from D− (poor stock choice) to A+ (good
stock choice).” The spatial position, value, and modality of the fluent and disfluent cues (i.e., brokerage firm
ratings) were fully counterbalanced.
Participants were told that the brokerage firms typically agree, although they might sometimes disagree. For
the stock the participants were asked to review, one brokerage firm gave a positive evaluation, while the other
brokerage firm gave a negative evaluation. Participants
rated each stock on three factors. First, participants were
asked to rate how well the stock would perform on a scale
of 1 (low) to 100 (high). Second, participants predicted
how much an initial investment of $1000 in shares of the
company would be worth in one year. Third, participants
rated how likely they would be to recommend this stock
to Turkish investors on a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 6
(very likely). The data from three participants were excluded from the analyses because two participants indicated that they understood Turkish (thus the names would
not be differentially fluent to them) and one participant
did not answer all of the questions.

4.2

Results and discussion

We conducted our analyses by collapsing across all
fluent-disfluent pairs of brokerage firms. Participants
who saw fluently named brokerage firms give high ratings indicated that the stocks would perform better (M
= 58.08, SE = 1.87) than did participants who saw disfluently named brokerage firms give high ratings (M =
52.27, SE = 2.13, t(139) = 2.06, p = .04, Cohen’s d = .35).
Furthermore, participants who saw fluent cues give high
ratings indicated they were more likely to recommend the
stock to Turkish investors (M = 3.49, SE = .11) than did
participants who saw disfluent cues give high ratings (M
= 2.95, SE = .12, t(139) = 3.36, p = .001, Cohen’s d = .57).
Finally, participants who saw fluent cues give high ratings
also predicted that their initial investment of $1000 would
be worth more in one year (M = $1135, SE = 58.26) than
did participants who saw disfluent cues give high ratings
(M =$1100, SE = 38.79), but not significantly so (t(139)
= .49, p = .62). The lack of a significant effect in the monetary evaluations may stem from the high variability that
resulted from using an open-ended scale.

Fluency and cue weighting

376

These data therefore suggest that people weight information from linguistically fluent sources more heavily
than information from disfluent sources when evaluating stocks based on the recommendations of brokerage
firms. Consequently, it becomes clear that a cue’s linguistic fluency, in addition to its perceptual fluency, affects how heavily the cue is weighted. That is, convergent evidence from multiple fluency manipulations suggests that fluency operates as a domain-general basis for
cue weighting.

5 General discussion
Although normative models propose that decisionmakers must weight cues by their objective validity, it has
been shown time and again that this is a difficult undertaking (Evans, Clibbens, Cattani, Harris, & Dennis, 2003,
Goodie & Crooks, 2004; Permut, 1973; Peterson & Pitz,
1985; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). In this paper, we
have proposed that people will often weight information
according to the ease with which it can be processed.
This application of fluency theory builds upon previous
fluency research, but emphasizes an indirect effect of fluency. Research on people’s experiences of fluency typically investigates how fluency itself serves as a cue. Tversky and Kahneman’s (1973, 1974) availability heuristic,
for instance, indicates how events that come easily to
mind will be judged as more likely to occur again in the
future. Although we do not dispute that fluency is often
used as a direct cue for judgment, our theory suggests
that fluency may also affect judgments indirectly. In this
sense, fluency can serve as a basis for deciding which
cues will be weighted most heavily.
We found support for this application of fluency in several domains. Experiments 1 and 2 showed how perceptual fluency can affect cue weighting in both betweensubjects and within-subjects manipulations. Experiment
3 extended these findings to the domain of linguistic fluency. We were also able to rule out the possibility that
mood changes would mediate the effect of fluency by
using within-subject manipulations (Experiments 2 and
3) and using a design in which our hypothesis diverged
from a mood-based account of fluency effects (Experiment 1). Although any individual fluency manipulation
might also alter other variables, by using convergent evidence from different fluency manipulations we can more
strongly state that it is indeed fluency that is affecting how
people are deciding to weight information.
In each of these studies, fluency was manipulated independently of objective cue validity. However, we did
find preliminary support for the idea that fluency affects
decision-makers’ subjective impressions of cue validity.
Such findings suggest that assessing the fluency of cues

<-----Page 6----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 2, No. 6, December 2007

may allow decision-makers to form impressions of cue
validity before integrating the information from the task
environment. In these studies, it might also be possible
that participants attended more to fluent information than
disfluent information, and that this attentional difference
was the source of the cue-weighting effects. Although
this account is consistent with the basic hypothesis that
fluent information will affect judgments more than disfluent information, it would be useful to further demonstrate that people pay equal attention to fluent and disfluent information, but weight fluent information more heavily. Additionally, a larger set of judgments per participant
would make it possible to obtain actual beta weights for
each cue to provide stronger evidence for the hypothesis.
On a related note, it might be possible that people
simply select accessible or fluent information until they
feel they have enough information and then disregard the
rest of the information. That is, fluency might determine
whether information is used, but not how that information
is differentially weighted.3 This noticeably differs from
our hypothesis that disfluent cues will still be weighted,
only less heavily. This is a possibility; however, it appears that participants in the studies above were weighting information from disfluent sources as well. Consider
the data from the third study — for both closed-scale responses (likelihood of recommending the stock and stock
performance), participants’ mean ratings were clustered
around the midpoint of the scales. This suggests that
both the extreme positive cue and the extreme negative
cue were affecting their judgments, but that the fluent
cue was weighed slightly more heavily. Although this
provides some post-hoc evidence for subtle cue weighting, actual regression coefficients would support the case
more strongly.
It may also be argued that if the participants had
a chance to learn cue validities then objective validity
would have also affected cue weighting. We are sympathetic to this point. We do not argue that fluency is the
sole mechanism by which people weight cues. Instead,
we argue that fluency affects cue weighting when validity information is not present and that fluency may itself
be a proxy for cue validity. However, the fact that we did
not manipulate cue validity provides questions for further
research into whether fluency will affect cue weighting
when objective validity information is known.
Some may also note similarities between the hypothesis that ease of processing affects cue weighting and the
evaluability hypothesis (Hsee, Loewenstein, Blound, &
Bazerman, 1999). The evaluability hypothesis describes
how attributes or cues can vary in how easy they are
to assess in joint- versus separate-evaluation tasks. Attributes that are easy to evaluate independently will carry

useful distinction.

377

more weight in separate evaluation. However, attributes
that are hard to evaluate independently might carry more
weight in joint evaluation (if juxtaposing two options
makes it easier to compare and evaluate the options along
this attribute). Although the fluency-based account and
the evaluability-based account of cue weighting are similar in their emphasis on ease of processing, the two theories diverge in describing how cues become easy to process. The fluency-based theory points to perceptual and
retrieval ease, while the evaluability hypothesis focuses
on the ease of mapping attribute values onto an evaluative scale. Although these theories differ, they are by no
means mutually exclusive and instead complement each
other by emphasizing ways in which decision-makers attempt to reduce cognitive effort.
Indeed, one of the original rationales for developing
a fluency-based account of cue weighting was the belief
that people may use fluent cues in order to save cognitive
effort. This leads to a prediction for future studies. If people are indeed using easier to access information because
this information provides a shortcut when confronting a
decision task, then this strategy ought to be used more
often when participants are placed under cognitive load.
Another rationale for our hypothesis was the belief that
fluency was an ecologically valid proxy for cue validity
because of associative learning. Future research should
investigate the extent to which increases in cue validity
actually lead to increases in fluency. If manipulating the
fluency of a cue can alter its perceived validity, then altering the objective validity of a cue might also alter its
fluency.
Although there is still much to be learned about how
fluency affects cue weighting, the evidence described
above opens the door to such research by demonstrating the effect of fluency on cue weighting when objective validities are unknown. These findings show how
fluency can affect numeric judgments indirectly, building
on the numerous studies where fluency affects judgment
directly. Furthermore, the idea that fluency can affect
cue weighting provides further insight into how decisionmakers often seek to reduce cognitive effort. And it ultimately appears that the extent to which we use information when making judgments may depend on a very basic
feature: how easy it is to process.

Consumer Review:
It only lasted about 3 months. For whatever reason, I couldn’t turn it on anymore.
I then had to send it back, and I got another one after about a month. The new one
has a busted directional pad that needs to be pushed in extremely hard for it to go
up. It seems like a good product if it weren’t so easy to break.
