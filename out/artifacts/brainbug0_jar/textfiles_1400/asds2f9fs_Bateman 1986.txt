ABSTRACT
Ttvo laboratory studies manipulated variables in order to observe their effect on the
escalation of individuals’ commitment to earlier investment decisions. The experimental
results indicated that escalation of commitment to a failing course of action is not a general
phenomenon. Information pertinent to the future prospects of reinvestment and to decisioii alternatives provided main effects. Neither study showed a main effect for initial success vs. failure. Decision-maker gender consistently influenced decisions in both studies
through interactions with success/failure feedback and through the communicated attributions of “powerful others” regarding the causes of previous decision outcomes. Implications for theory and research are discussed.
Subject Areas: Decision Processes and Organizational Behavior.

INTRODUCTION
Extensive research and theory in the administrativesciences has tried to understand managerial decision making. Many important decisions made by policymakers
in both the private and public sectors involve investing resources with the intention
of bringing about financial or social improvement. Such decisions often are sequential in nature. The outcome of an initial decision to commit resources to a
course of action frequently sets the stage for subsequent decisions such as whether
or not to continue pursuing the original course of action or whether to increase,
maintain, or reduce the initial level of support. Research conducted by Staw and
others [24] [27] [28] [13] [5] has begun to isolate some of the factors that influence
an individual’s escalation of commitment to a previously chosen course of action.
Staw [26] recently described the existing research into decisions made incrementally over time. Most studies have assumed that a decision maker who chooses a
course of action and subsequently learns that the decision produces negative consequences “throws good money after bad,” that is, commits new resources to a
losing course of action. The need to self-justify [33] or to prove the rationality of
an earlier decision can interfere with economic rationality. In other words, the maximization of future utility, assumed by traditional subjective expected-utility models,
often is overridden by the psychological influence of previous expenditures. The
result often is a poor and costly decision.
In this paper we describe the results of two studies. These studies investigated
situational and personal moderators of the effect of success or failure of previous

decisions on the subsequent commitment of additional resources. The four manipulated variables were: (1) incoming information regarding the probability of success of further investment in the same course of action, (2) information regarding
alternative courses of action, (3) gender of the decision maker, and (4) attributions
of “powerful others” regarding causes of the initial decision’s outcome.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND
Staw [24] developed a simulated business case in which participants played
the role of a corporate financial officer asked to allocate research and development (R&D) funds to one of two operating divisions of the company. Subjects were
given the results of their initial decision (either positive or negative) and then asked
to make a further allocation of funds. Staw [24] found main effects for: (1) more
additional funds allocated after failure than after success and (2) more additional
funds allocated when the subject had been responsible for the decision personally
(is., the subject had made the initial decision) than if the earlier decision had been
made by another financial officer.
?ko subsequent studies that used the same type of decision situation [27] [28]
concluded that the motivation to justify an earlier bad decision does not necessarily
interfere with rational economic decision making. In the Staw and Fox (271 study,
a consultant’s report which indicated a high probability of payoff for additional
investment led to subsequently higher commitment of funds than a less optimistic
report. Staw and Ross [28] found that subjects allocated more funds when the indicated cause of the initial setback was identified as exogenous (outside the system,
could not have been predicted, and unlikely to be present in the future) than when
the cause was identified as endogenous (part of the system and likely to continue).
The subjects also apparently were more sensitive and responsive to this type of information (regarding the cause of setbacks) after failure than after success.
In these studies, then, economic rationality was not preempted by the need
to demonstrate retrospective rationality [26] created by failure feedback on a prior
decision. In fact, Staw and Fox’s [27] results suggest that failure may heighten economic rationality in subsequent decisions. This is in contrast to the idea that failure
feedback necessarily leads to a poor decision marked by escalation of commitment.
The inappropriate use of (or failure to use) information pertinent to an upcoming decision may be evidence of a biased, poorly conceived resource-allocation
decision caused by failure feedback and a psychological commitment to selfjustification. However, as Northcraft and Wolf [21] pointed out recently, most of
the experimental decision contexts used have not provided sufficient information
to determine the economic advisability (or inadvisability) of additional commitment of funds. Hence, “only through examining decisions in situations in which
further resource commitment is demonstrably irrational can the psychologist hope
to add to the explanatory power of economic accounts of resource allocation decision making” [21, p. 2271.
The fundamentalindicator of a person’s prospective rationality (or lack thereof)
is how information regarding the probabilities of future outcomes, including

<-----Page 2----->19861

information pertaining to decision alternatives, is used. It is important to determine the conditions under which pertinent incoming information is used effectively
or is overridden by the motivation to justify past behavior. W o studies noted earlier
[27] [28] touched on these issues by incorporating variables that contained information about future outcomes. However, neither study compared the interaction
of success and failure with a pure manipulation of information (in the form of
future probabilities of successful reinvestment). In addition, neither study provided
information regarding decision alternatives. The subjects typically faced decisions
that involved a common alternative to the reinvestment of additional funds-for
example, any monies (of a fixed available amount) not reinvested in the original
division would be “reserved for other uses.”
This ambiguity about the nature of the decision alternative-held constant
across experimental conditions-is not inappropriate when the effects of other situational variables on the decision criterion are of interest. However, varying the characteristics of decision alternatives makes it possible to explore other likely contextual effects on the decision to escalate (or de-escalate) commitment to a previously
chosen course of action. Indeed, psycholgists increasingly emphasize the need to
consider the consequences of alternative responses available in a given situation
I141 and the conditions that produce changes in behavior from one activity to
another [l].
A fuller understanding of the factors that influence escalating commitment
in sequential decision making can be reached by discovering not only the pertinent
characteristics of the past decision and its present outlook [26] but also by considering the constraints and opportunities presented by the available alternatives. For
instance, like the initially chosen course of action, an important characteristic of
the alternative would be its probability of future success. It might be predicted that
the greater the probability is of successful investment in the decision alternative,
the lower the level of reinvestment in the original course of action.
We also might predict a main effect due to the future probabilities of success
in the original alternative (as in Staw and Fox [27]). More important, an interaction effect also is likely if Staw and Ross’s [28] conclusions generalize to the present studies. Staw and Ross explained the interaction between success/failure and
exogenous/endogenous cause by suggesting that failure sensitized subjects to incoming information regarding cause. If this explanation is valid, then subjects who
fail can be predicted to be influenced more strongly by incoming information regarding the probabilities of future success than subjects who succeed. Such an interaction would overshadow the importance of any main effects.
The research of Staw and others has been based on the belief that failure feedback from an initial decision will trigger escalating commitment to the original
course of action. Some qualifications have been indicated, but Staw’s [26] model
and other perspectivesindicate the need to investigateother moderators of the escalation phenomenon. Study 1, reported below, manipulated the success or failure of
an initial decision, the effects of incoming information regarding the probability
of successful reinvestment in the original course of action, and the information
available about the future prospects of an alternativeinvestment. A complex finding

<-----Page 3----->36

[Vol. 17

from Study 1 was confirmed in Study 2, which investigated the interaction of gender
differences with the success or failure of the initial decision and the communicated
attributions of “powerful others” regarding the causes for these initial outcomes.

STUDY 1

Method
Subjects. The subjects in Study 1 were 99 undergraduate students at a large
state university. Their participation in the study represented partial fulfillment of
a course requirement for an upper-division management course in which they were
enrolled. Cell sizes were 12 or 13. Roughly equal proportions of males (n=5 1) and
females (n=48) were assigned to the experimental cells. Assignment of the subjects was random within this constraint.
As in most of the previous studies, the subjects were asked to work on Staw’s
[24] “Adams and Smith Financial Decision Case.” Since the subjects were students
at a business school, they were experienced in working on written cases and in recommending courses of managerial action. They also displayed a generally high level
of interest and involvement in the case.
Decision Task. The Adams and Smith case places each subject in the role of
financial vice president. Information regarding the financial history of the company indicates a recent decline in profitability, primarily due to shortcomings in
the company’s R&D program. The company’s board of directors has determined
that $10 million in additional funds should be allocated to one of the company’s
two largest operating divisions. Each division is described. The subject is asked
to decide which of the two divisions should receive the additional R&D investment.
In fact, neither division represents a better or more likely choice than the other.
After making this initial decision, each subject was exposed to the conditions
of one of eight experimental cells. These cells were created by independently manipulating three variables.
Success/FailureManipulation. After making their initial decision, half the subjects were placed in the success condition. In this condition, feedback in the form
of financial data indicated a steady improvement in the company’s earnings and
a return to profitability in the five years since the chosen division received the extra
$10 million. Subjects in the failure condition received financial data indicating a
continued decline in the company’s earnings and increasing financial losses.
Futue Probabilities Manipulations. More feedback (in the form of a memorandum from the president) concerned a report from a consulting team that had “performed admirably for us many times in the past.” The team had provided an “accurate. . .appraisal of our current status” and had drawn conclusions about the
probabilities of profitability of additional R&D investment in the two operating
divisions. The use of a consulting report was similar to Staw and Fox’s [27] manipulation of efficacy of resources except that probability estimates were provided for
investment in the previously rejected division as well as for the previously selected
division. For each division, either a 30 percent or a 70 percent probability of success was indicated, resulting in four possible probability combinations.

<-----Page 4----->19861

Dependent Variable. Each subject had an additional $20 million to be allocated
between the two divisions. The amount of funds reinvested in the original choice
served as the dependent variable of behavioral commitment. ?\No other possible
dependent variables-the amount of funds invested in the other division and the
difference between the two investments-were not used because they would measure
the identical activity.
Manipulation Checks. In order to check the effectiveness of the experimental
manipulations an 1 1-item questionnaire was developed and administeredto all subjects. Three of the items on the questionnaire addressed perceived success and failure.
An example is, “In objective terms (that is, on the ‘bottom line‘), my original decision was the correct one.” The manipulation of probabilities of future success for
the two divisions were tested with four items each. For each probability, one item
was phrased in terms of explicit percentages and checked to see that the subject
was aware of the content of the consultants’ report (i.e., “What was the probability
that additional investment would reach an acceptable level of profitability?”). The
other three items did not contain explicit percentages and therefore more truly represented psychological states (i.e., perceptions of the general chances for success).
For example, subjects were asked the extent of their agreement with the statement,
“It was fairly certain that reinvesting more money into the same division had a
high probability of paying off.’’
Experimental Design. The experiment thus employed a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial
design. It manipulated success vs. failure, the probabilities of future success of investment in the previously chosen division, and the probabilities of success of investment in the other division. The effects of gender difference also were tested
because of their wide-ranging implications for achievement, performance, response
to feedback, and other behaviors [6] [7]. The dependent variable was the amount
of additional money committed to the previously chosen division.
Results

Manipulation Checks. The three manipulation checks had acceptably high internal reliabilities (coefficient alphas ranged from .80 to .90) and indicated that
the experimental variables had had their intended effects. The success/failure manipulation was significant at t(97)= 6.34, p < .001; the probability manipulations
for the initially chosen division and the other division were significant at t(97)=5.33,
pc.001 and at t(97)=3.43,p<.OOl.
Effects of Experimental Manipulations. Although significant interaction effects lessened their importance, two of the three main effects of the manipulated
variables were significant. Results of the analysis of variance are summarized in
Table 1 . Subjects invested more money when the probability of success for the
original division was 70 percent (F(1,83)=8.20,p=.005) than when it was 30 percent (2=$12.56 million, SD=4.13 vs. 2=$10.10 million, SD=4.90). They also invested more money in the initially chosen division when the probability of successful investment in the other division was 30 percent (F(1,83)=9.37,p=.OO3, explaining 7 percent of the variance) than when it was 70 percent (F=$12.67 million,

SD=3.73 vs. X=$10.02 million, SD=4.98). No main effect was shown for succedfailure (F(1,83)=.01, p=.933; X=$11.35 million, SD=4.42 vs. X=$11.32
million, SD =4.80).
Success and failure did affect decisions through interaction with the probability
of future success for the initially chosen division (F(1,83)= 5.13, p =.026, 3 percent of the variance explained). This effect is shown in Figure 1. The highest levels
of additional resources were invested when failure on the first decision was followed by a high probability of subsequent success; failure followed by a lower probability of future success resulted in the lowest investment levels. In short, the information about future probabilities had greater impact after failure than after success.
Gender Effects. In addition to the above findings, a 3-way interaction effect
was found among gender of the decision maker, success/failure, and the probability of success with the initially selected division (F(1,83)=5.98, p=.O17). This interaction effect, which explained 4 percent of the variance, is depicted in Figures
2A and 2B. Females invested more money when the odds were higher, regardless
of the outcome of their initial decisions (Figure 2A). Males, on the other hand,
revealed an investment pattern that differed according to the results of their prior
decisions. After failure, males (like females) invested more money when the odds
of success were higher. However, initial success led males to invest less money when
the odds of future sucess were 70 percent than when the odds were 30 percent (Figure
2B).

Discussion
llvo main effects showed that subjects generally made appropriate use of independently provided information concerning the future probabilities of success.
The experience of success or failure and the gender of the decision maker also contributed, through interaction effects, to the level of investment in this decision task.
Main effects in factorial designs often are considered secondary in importance
to interactive effects. However, it should be noted at least briefly that both main
effects in Study 1 indicated a degree of economic rationality. The impact of the
probability of success with the second division illustrates the importance of incorporating decision alternative characteristics in the analysis of sequential decision
making. The relative attractivenessof decision alternatives can be assessed and acted
on [ l l ] [31], just as other behavioral contexts can provide alternatives that differ
in attractiveness [I] [ 141. The differing characteristics of alternatives also may provide a tactful reason for withdrawing from a previously selected course of action
or may aid the decision maker in justifying the decision made [25].
The contributions of success and failure, via interaction effects, show the importance of past decisions to present decisions 1261. The relative lack of information use after success (when compared to failure) was consistent with the findings
of Staw and Ross [28] who manipulated information regarding the predictability

and persistence of the (negative) outcome‘s cause. The present finding adds generality
to their results and supports their interpretation that prior failure sensitizes subjects to those aspects of incoming information which are pertinent to economic
rationality.
The 2-way interaction indicated a generally greater responsiveness to probability information after failure than after success, but this pattern did not hold
for all subjects. Females were unaffected by the results of their prior decisions and
consistently committed more funds when there was a higher probability of success. On the other hand, males who succeeded were not only unresponsive to information about future probabilities; their decisions were contrary to those which
should have been suggested by the prospective odds. Males who received success
feedback reinvested more money when the odds of future success were 30 percent
than when the odds were 70 percent. This clear departure from prospective rationality (as suggested by the independently provided probability statements) differed
from the decisions of female subjects and those male subjects who had failed in
their initial decisions.
The higher investment by males when success was followed by a threat of failure
(in the form of a low chance of future success) suggests a reactance effect [3]. Staw
and Ross I281 also used reactance theory to interpret their results. Reactance is a
state of motivational arousal caused by a threat to an individual’s behavioral freedom
or a barrier to his or her desired outcomes [34]. Individuals faced with such a threat
restore their personal freedom by attempting to perform the forbidden behavior
or to attain the desired outcome. Thus subjects who initially perform well on a
decision task but who then are presented with the possibility that continuing in
that course of action will result in failure may attempt tG reaffirm their personal
control by pursuing that action further.
Unlike the male subjects, female subjects did not exhibit reactance. This may
be explained by referring to Staw and Ross’s [28] belief that reactance is the arousal
of a competence motive (321 and the further belief that males are distinguished
from females by a cluster of competence-relatedtraits [6]. Other research, including
that looking at attribution theory and learned helplessness [lo], also has noted
gender differences in response to performance feedback. These differences are elaborated and confirmed in our second study, reported below.
STUDY 2
While reactance theory can be used to account for the interactive gender effects noted in Study 1, it was felt that a second study, different in design but predicting a priori gender effects similar to those found in Study 1, would provide
additional support for conclusions regarding how males and females respond differently to feedback during sequential decision making.
Attribution theory [15] provides a useful perspective from which to study gender
differences in the escalation of commitment. It may be used to provide Study 2
with predictions for female and male behavior based on reactance theory and the
results of Study 1.

<-----Page 9----->42

Decision Sciences

[Vol. 17

One part of attribution theory literature has focused on the behavior people
exhibit in response to what they themselves see as the causes of their own behavior
or performance [81. Surprisingly little is known, however, about how individuals
respond to attributions regarding the causes of their performance made by others.
Munson and Kiesler [19] showed that a person’s attitudes can be affected by the
attitudes attributed and communicated by others. The effects of communicated
performance attribution, however, have gone relatively unstudied in adults.
Research with children has demonstrated that females are more likely than
males to show decreased persistence or impaired performance after failure [lo].
Girls are more likely to attribute their failures to lack of ability, which in turn leads
to learned helplessness (the belief that failure is unavoidable). Moreover, girls are
more likely to exhibit learned helplessness when the feedback on their task performance is presented as an important measure of their personal ability [20], especially
when the evaluative feedback comes from adults [9]. Thus, the attributions communicated by an evaluator when delivering performance feedback affects girls more
than boys [lo]. Dweck and her colleagues [lo] further suggested that these differences may become stabilized and generalized later in life.
Learned helplessness and reactance allow us to predict a three-way interaction
among the decision maker’s gender, decision feedback, and the causal attributions
of others regarding decision outcomes. Learned helplessness suggests that female
subjects will withdraw support from a decision that fails, especially when powerful others blame them for the failure. On the other hand, males-who are relatively unaffected by personal attributions of failure or by learned helplessness-might
be expected to display patterns of reactance similar to those shown in Study 1 .
The reactance that occurred among males in Study 1 after success feedback was
followed by a threat of failure also could be expected in Study 2 when success feedback is followed by attributions by others to external causes for the success. Here,
where the threat is the refusal of powerful others to give the decision maker credit
for the success of a decision, reactance (as it did in Study 1) might take the form
of male subjects asserting their behavioral freedom by continuing in the same course
of action.

Method

Subjects. The subjects in this experiment were 80 undergraduate students at
the same large state university used in Study 1 . All were enrolled in upper-division
management courses. The subjects took part in the study on a voluntary basis and,
unlike the subjects in Study 1, were paid $5 for approximately one hour of participation. Each cell contained 10 subjects. Roughly equal proportions of males (n=44)
and females ( n= 36) were assigned to the experimental conditions.
Decision Esk. As in Study 1 (and most of the other previous studies), subjects were asked to work on Staw’s [24] “Adams and Smith Financial Decision Case”
The case again generated a high level of interest among the students.
Experimental Manipulations. All subjects, after making their initial choice of
division, received financial feedback regarding the outcomes of their decisions. This

<-----Page 10----->19861

43

feedback was the same as that used in Study 1. Subjects in the success condition
were given financial data that indicated a steady improvement and return to profitability in the five years since the division chosen received the extra $10 million
in investment money. In the failure condition, subjects received financial data indicating a continued decline in earnings and an increase in financial losses.
Subjects also received a memorandum from the president of the company which
referred to the outcome of their previous decision. This made the success or failure
of that decision more explicit. The memorandum also described the subject’s role
in the upcoming funding decision.
Manipulation of Attributions Made by Powerful Others. All subjects next
received another memorandum from the president of the company. In this memorandum, the president referred to discussions with members of the board of directors
and described their attributions for the causes of the initial investment decision’s
outcome. The directors either held the subject personally responsible for the outcome (attributions of internal causation) or felt that the results were due to causes
beyond the subject’s control (attributions of external causation). Specifically, subjects who received success feedback were informed either that the board was pleased
with the outcome and felt that the success of their decision reflected well on the
subjects personally or that the board felt the division (and not the decision maker)
should get the credit (for using the funds so effectively). Those subjects who received
failure feedback were informed either that the board blamed them personally for
the failure or that the board felt that the continued earnings decline occurred for
reasons that were unpredictable and beyond the subjects’ control. In all cases, these
attributes were reinforced with a statement that the subject’s upcoming performance
evaluation would (in the case of internal attributions) or would not (in the case
of external attributions) be affected.
Manipulation of IIZformation about the Probabilities of Future Success. A final
memorandum from the president concerned a report from a consulting team described in Study 1. The team provided their conclusions regarding the probability
that additional investment of funds into the same division would pay off. Either
a 50 percent or 80 percent probability of profitable outcome was indicated in the
report. These probabilities were used to convey ambiguously moderate versus clearly
strong probabilities of success.
Dependent Variable. The dependent variable again was a measure of the subject’s commitment to the previously selected investment alternative. After receiving the above information, each subject was given an additional $20 million to invest. All, none, or any part of this money could be allocated to the same division
chosen earlier. The remainder would be reserved for other uses. The amount of
funds invested in the initial division served as the dependent measure of behavioral
commitment.
Manipulation Checks. The effectiveness of the manipulations was tested with
a postexperimental questionnaire. Three items (identical to those used in Study 1)
addressed perceived success and failure. Three other items (such as, “The Board
of Directors believed that my decision had the results it did because of influences
outside my control”) assessed the subjects’ perceptions of the board of directors’

<-----Page 11----->[Vol. 17

44

attribution of causes for the decision outcomes. The manipulation of the probability
of future success in the original division was tested with three items that measured
the subjects’ perceptions of general chances of success (e.g., high or low) and one
item that contained explicit percentages. These items checked the subjects’ awareness
of the content of the consultants’ report.
Experimental Design. The experiment thus employed a 2 x 2x 2 x 2 factorial
design. It varied the decision maker’s gender, success vs. failure outcomes, attributions of decision performance by powerful others to internal or external causes,
and the probability of future investment success with the initially selected division.
The dependent variable was the amount of additional money committed to the
previously chosen division.
Results

Manipulation Checks. Tests of the three manipulation checks revealed acceptably high internal reliabilities (coefficient alphas ranged from .77 to .85). The
tests also showed that all three experimental manipulations had had their intended
effects. The success/failure manipulation was significant at t(78) =4.96, p <.001;
the manipulation of future probabilities was significant at t(78)=4.96, p <.001
Effects of Experimental Manipulations. The results of the analysis of variance
are summarized in nble 2. The dependent variable (the amount of additional funds
invested in the division initially chosen) wa s tested with a 4-way analysis of variance.

Of particular interest in conjunction with the interactive gender effects seen in Study
1 were the interactions of .the experimental manipulations with gender differences.
One main effect (overridden in importance by an interaction effect) was significant (F(1,64)=4.82, p=.O31): subjects whose decision outcomes were attributed
(by powerful others) to external causes out of their control committed more additional funds to the original project (F=$12.99 million, SD=3.79) than those subjects whose decision outcomes were attributed to internal causes (E= $10.81 million,
SD=4.82). These attributions explained 5 percent of the variance in reinvestment.
The other main effects, and the interactions among the three manipulated variables,
were insignificant.
Gender Effects. The major research question in Study 2 concerned gender differences in response to the experimental conditions. A significant 3-way interaction effect (F(1,64) =5.13, p = .027) was found explaining 5 percent of the variance
in the dependent variable. The nature of this interaction is shown in Figures 3A
and 3B. Any differential impact on the attributions made by others was shown in
the success condition for males (Figure 3B); it was shown in the failure condition
for females (Figure 3A). Male subjects who received success feedback allocated
the most additional money when their success was attributed to causes beyond their
control. They allocated the least additional money when their success was attributed
to internal causes. Female subjects who were successful, on the other hand, were
relatively unaffected by whether their success was attributed to internal or to external causes. In the failure conditions, the responses of male subjects did not vary
in response to the attributions of powerful others. However, the responses of female
subjects did vary; females whose failures were attributed to internal causes invested
the least additional resources, while failure attributed to external causes produced
the highest level of additional investment.

Discussion

As in Study 1, male and female subjects seemed to respond to different experimental conditions using different mechanisms. Under failure conditions, the
behavior of female subjects was consistent with the predictions of reinforcement
theory and learned helplessness [lo]. Attributions of personal blame for failure,
and the accompanyingthreat of punishment, produced much lower subsequent commitments of resources than when no such blame was attributed.
Under success conditions, male subjects exhibited behavior consistent with
Brehm’s [3] theory of psychological reactance. Males who were informed that their
success had been attributed to external causes beyond their control invested the
largest amounts of money. The attribution of success to internal causes, accompanied by praise, produced low levels of additional investment (contrary to the
predictions of reinforcement theory). Again, that males but not females would respond with psychological reactance is consistent with Staw and Ross’s [28] belief
that reactance may be seen as the arousal of a competence motive [32] and that
males are distinguished from females by a cluster of traits reflecting competence [61.

relevant to (1) the effect of information regarding the future prospects of reinvestment in a previously selected course of action, (2) the effect of decision alternative
characteristics, and (3) the effect of gender in interaction with success/failure feedback and the communicated attributions of cause by powerful others.
Neither study found a main effect indicating more commitment after failure
than after success. Thus, there was no indication that the escalation of commitment to a failing course of action is a general phenomenon. Either other variables
in the two studies had direct effects on commitment or, when success/failure did
have an effect, it was in interaction with situational and/or individual difference
moderators.
As with all laboratory research, the question of how general the results are
remains. At least two studies provide evidence for the external validity of this type
of decision research. Both studies [2] [29] found no difference between the decision behavior of actual managers and undergraduate business students in similar
investment commitment tasks presented in a laboratory setting. Other studies discuss
the utility of laboratory research in general and of laboratory decision research
in particular [4] [ 121 [ 131. Still, other samples and methods should be used to extend our understanding of the effects reported in these studies (e.g., how women
and men change their respective approaches to decision making as they gain
experience).
We offer several observations in conclusion. First, in Study 2 the subjects’ behavior was unaffected by incoming information useful for analyzing future investment prospects. Perhaps the communicated attributions of others regarding previous
outcome success or failure interacted with the decision maker’s gender to override
the impact of this incoming information. Future research should continue to explore the factors affecting the use (or lack of use) of such pertinent information
in sequential decision making.
Second, the communicated attributions of powerful others regarding the success or failure of the decision outcome affected decision behavior. This aspect of
work relationships has far-reaching implications for the study of organizational
behavior and should not be neglected in future studies of attribution and motivation. While recent research has examined the behavioral response of supervisors
to their own attributions of cause for subordinates’ behavior [18], the responses
of subordinates to the communicated attributions of cause (in decision or in other
performance contexts) has been explored only with children and their teachers [lo].
While the manipulation used in Study 2 may not h.ave created a truly realistic powerful other for the undergraduate sample in that laboratory context (and may therefore
have created a demand characteristicor experimenter effect), nevertheless its potential importance seems clear. That the experimenter was a powerful other in this
evaluative context and that theory-based gender differences arose in reaction to
that manipulation argue for the continued exploration of this construct in other
investigative areas.
Third, consider that the female subjects in Study 2 invested the largest amount
of additional resources after their failure was attributed to an external cause, whereas
the male subjects committed lower levels of funds after their success was attributed
to an internal cause. Future research should concentrate not only on conditions

<-----Page 15----->48

[Vol. 17

that increase commitment to a losing course of action, but also should consider
the causes of decisions characterized by a retreat from a winning course of action.
Fourth, similar gender differences were found in both studies. The study of
gender as an individual difference variable has shifted from attempts to identify
differentiating characteristics (i.e., main effects) to attempts to analyze the interactions between gender differences and situational characteristics[6]. This shift reflects
a more general movement in psychological research as a whole [I61 and is particularly relevant to organizational behavior [23] [30]. The interactions shown in the
present studies are examples of such person-situation interactions.
By themselves, gender differences are not interesting from a theoretical standpoint. They do not explain why behavior differs. While a reactance effect among
males but not females may explain the results of the present studies, further confirmation that this is the correct explanation is necessary. But regardless of the underlying mechanism, a comparison of the validity, reliability, and accessibility of
the gender-difference variable with those of other individual difference measures
makes this variable’s practical utility readily apparent.
Finally, the differential impact of gender demonstrates that different theoretical
mechanisms are activated for different types of individuals under different types
of circumstances. This is consistent with the implications of a number of authors.
Mayes [I71 called attention to the need for delimiting some of the boundary conditions of different motivation theories. Pinder and Moore [22] described the development of middle-range organizational theories which could be developed similarly for individual behavior. Staw and Ross [28] emphasized the need to uncover
conditions that moderate or heighten various theoretical mechanisms during decision making. Conceptual and empirical work should continue to explore and identify
factors that arouse, limit, and moderate the effects of reactance, learned helplessness, and other psychological mechanisms on escalating commitment in sequential decision making. [Received October 15, 1984. Accepted: May 20, 1985.1
