ubstantial gains can be made by individuals and organizations adept at detecting new opportunities. But how do
business leaders do that concretely? Organization research shows that managers are more inclined to identify threats
than opportunities, but it is still not clear why this is the case. Likewise, research points to several factors that may facilitate
the recognition of opportunities. Yet empirical observations have been limited by retrospective biases and other conceptual
challenges. As a result, key questions remain not only about what factors facilitate the recognition of opportunities, but also
about why these factors play such a role. To further understanding of these issues, we study the reasoning strategies that
individuals mobilize for recognizing opportunities. We develop a model of opportunity recognition as a cognitive process
of structural alignment, and analyze the think-aloud verbalizations of executive entrepreneurs as they try to recognize
opportunities for new technologies. In contrast to prior research, the qualitative and quantitative data do not provide evidence
that individuals use prototypes to recognize opportunities. Instead, we ﬁnd that different kinds of mental connections play
different roles in the process of recognizing opportunities, with different consequences. We also document why and how
prior knowledge may facilitate this process. By drawing attention to the cognitive underpinnings of opportunity recognition,
we cast light on why it constitutes such a challenging task for individuals and organizations. In turn, this provides a useful
basis for exploring the factors that explain why some individuals/organizations are able to recognize opportunities that
others simply fail to see.

known about the factors that inﬂuence managers’ perception of signals in their organizations’ environments
(Dutton 1993, Kaplan 2008, Ocasio 1997), a great deal
remains to be learned about opportunity recognition. For
instance, organization research has found that managers
are more inclined to identify threats than opportunities, yet explanations for this “threat bias” have focused
on threats, and in particular on understanding why the
identiﬁcation of threats is more prevalent than that of
opportunities (Jackson and Dutton 1988, Schneider and
De Meyer 1991). Comparatively less attention has been
directed at the process(es) by which one recognizes
opportunities. Baron (2006, p. 104) proposed that the
identiﬁcation of opportunities involves pattern recognition, or the ability to “ ‘connect the dots’ between
changes in technology, demographics, markets, government policies, and other factors.” Along this line, Baron
and Ensley (2006) showed that the opportunity prototypes of experts are more complex than those of novices.
These studies represent signiﬁcant steps toward understanding opportunity recognition. Yet a number of conceptual issues and empirical challenges continue to

Organizations operate in complex and dynamic environments that are increasingly characterized by rapid,
substantial, and discontinuous change (Brown and Eisenhardt 1997, Hitt 2000). To sustain a competitive advantage, managers must respond strategically to these
changes (Ireland and Hitt 1999, Pérez-Nordtvedt et al.
2008). Indeed, signiﬁcant gains in proﬁt, growth, and/or
competitive positioning can be made by those individuals and organizations adept at exploiting the opportunities that arise in such changing environments (Eisenhardt
1989, Eisenhardt and Martin 2000, Sirmon et al. 2007).
From the perspective of individual actors, however,
uncertainty about the origin, extent, and consequences
of environmental changes makes the task of recognizing
opportunities as challenging as it is relevant.
Past studies have shown that the perception of
inconsistencies between environmental signals and prior
assumptions acts as a “trigger” that focuses attention
upon interpreting the signal—and ultimately motivates
the formulation and implementation of an organizational response (Corner et al. 1994, Dutton and Duncan
1987, Dutton and Jackson 1987). Though much may be

impede research in this area. For instance, several studies ask about opportunities that were recognized in some
distant past and are thus limited by retrospective and
success biases (Golden 1992, Huber and Power 1985).
As a result, it remains difﬁcult to determine exactly how
opportunity recognition is fostered by the attention allocated toward environmental signals (Ocasio 1997, Shepherd et al. 2007), the perceived characteristics of those
signals (Jackson and Dutton 1988, Julian and OforiDankwa 2008), abilities to process information (Kuvaas
2002, Milliken 1990), the unique resources, organizational slack, or strategy of a ﬁrm (Chattopadhyay
et al. 2001, Thomas and McDaniel 1990), or the use of
prior knowledge (Dimov 2007b, Shane 2000, Shepherd
and DeTienne 2005) and other individual or organizational resources and abilities (Barnett 2008, Cattani and
Ferriani 2008). In short, key questions remain not only
about what factors facilitate the recognition of opportunities, but also about why these factors play such a
fundamental role.
To further our understanding of these issues, we
study the reasoning strategies that individuals mobilize for recognizing opportunities. More concretely, we
explore two hitherto unanswered questions: What cognitive processes supports individual efforts to recognize opportunities? What is the speciﬁc role of prior
knowledge in this processes? To investigate these questions, we develop a model of opportunity recognition
as a cognitive process of structural alignment (Gentner
1983, 1989). We then conduct a series of exercises with
executive entrepreneurs to record their think-aloud verbalizations as they try to recognize opportunities for new
technologies. By analyzing these verbalizations, we document the extent to which executive entrepreneurs use
structural alignment processes in their efforts to recognize opportunities for new technologies. We also investigate the role of prior knowledge in this process.
Although our theoretical model, research design, and
empirical results focus on individual processes, our
study has wider implications for organizational research.
As Crossan et al. (1999) showed with respect to organizational learning, recognizing opportunities involves
dynamics that take shape at the interindividual, group,
organization, and society levels (Davidsson 2003, Dimov
2007a); but at the root of this multilevel phenomenon,
there remain individual processes that are poorly understood. Furthermore, opportunity recognition is a necessary precursor to individual and organizational efforts to
evaluate opportunities, and to pursue them (McMullen
and Shepherd 2006, Thomas et al. 1993). Seen in this
light, individual processes for recognizing opportunities
are not only important for the birth of new ﬁrms, they are
important for organizational strategy, adaptation, learning, and renewal (Crossan and Berdrow 2003, Gavetti
2005, Mosakowski 1998, Zott and Amit 2007).

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

By investigating the cognitive processes of opportunity recognition, we make three primary contributions
to the literature. First, our paper is among the ﬁrst to
develop and test a model that speciﬁes the cognitive processes involved in recognizing opportunities. In contrast
to the suggestions of prior research (Baron 2006, Baron
and Ensley 2006), the executives in our research did not
use opportunity prototypes and their attributes. We ﬁnd
instead that entrepreneurs’ efforts to recognize opportunities rested on their cognitive alignment of new technologies and markets. By showing that different kinds of
“mental connections” play different roles, with different
consequences, we contribute a better understanding of
the cognitive mechanics that underpin the process of recognizing opportunities. Second, we further understanding of the speciﬁc role that prior knowledge plays in this
process. Numerous studies have linked prior knowledge
to opportunity recognition (Corbett 2005, Dimov 2007b,
Fiet 1996, Shane 2000, Shepherd and DeTienne 2005),
but few have explored the mechanism by which this
occurs. By focusing on this mechanism, we help explain
why, when, and how prior knowledge may facilitate—
or hinder—efforts to recognize opportunities. Third, our
ﬁndings provide new insights into equivocal ﬁndings
regarding opportunity recognition in organizations. Prior
research has identiﬁed a “threat bias” in managers: they
are quick to identify issues as potential threats, but are
less likely to identify opportunities (Jackson and Dutton
1988, Schneider and De Meyer 1991). By focusing on
the cognitive process(es) supporting opportunity recognition, our research offers new avenues for explaining
potential differences between how threats and opportunities are recognized in organizations.

Deﬁning Opportunity Recognition

There is an ongoing debate about the ontological nature
of opportunities: do opportunities arise as objective
artifacts waiting to be “discovered” by predisposed
individuals, or do they arise out of the subjective interpretations and creative actions of these individuals?
The debate has generated considerable attention (cf.
Davidsson 2003, Gartner et al. 2003, McMullen et al.
2007). Yet we believe that in its current articulation, it
leads to an impasse that hinders research on the phenomena most directly relevant for organization scholars:
the process(es) by which individuals and organizations
recognize opportunities.
We take the position that instead of emphasizing
the objective or subjective nature of opportunities, it
is useful to articulate our research on the notion that
opportunities arise from changes—whether the development of new knowledge by individuals and organizations, changes in the behavior of relevant actors
in the economy (e.g., competitors, consumers, suppliers, institutions, etc.), or wide-ranging changes in the

<-----Page 2----->Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

macroenvironment (e.g., market saturation, deregulation,
business cycles, etc.). But though these changes may
make current practices suboptimal, they do not form
opportunities in and of themselves. For example, an
inventor who comes up with a new technology may
introduce an objectively identiﬁable change to the environment, but he or she does not yet “have” an opportunity, no more than the new technology itself represents
the opportunity. Opportunities are courses of action that
seek to derive beneﬁts from these changes. In the case
of entrepreneurship, for instance, opportunities for a new
technology would thus lie in applying the technology
in a particular market (cf. Venkatarman and Sarasvathy
2001, p. 652; but see also Drucker 1985, Eckhardt and
Shane 2003).
However, because of the asymmetric diffusion of
knowledge (Hayek 1945) and limits to individual rationality (Simon 1957), the appropriateness of applying a
new technology to a particular market is uncertain ex
ante (Knight 1921, McMullen and Shepherd 2006); it
may only be determined post hoc. It follows that the process of recognizing opportunities involves both objective
and subjective dimensions: the objective reality of one’s
context and the subjective interpretations that one makes
of this context and of one’s position in it—before the
facts can be objectively known.
Accordingly, recent theorizing on entrepreneurial
action has emphasized the distinction between two
nested phases of entrepreneurial action (McMullen and
Shepherd 2006). The ﬁrst phase concerns the formation of subjective beliefs that an opportunity exists for
those with the relevant abilities and means to exploit it
(2006, p. 137). The second concerns the evaluation of
the opportunity for oneself (or for one’s organization),
that is, whether one has the means and motivations to
act on the opportunity. To date, most studies of opportunity recognition have either not made the distinction
between the two phases of opportunity processes (e.g.,
Baron and Ensley 2006), or have focused on the evaluation phase (e.g., Chattopadhyay et al. 2001, Krueger and
Brazeal 1994, Sarasvathy 2001, Thomas and McDaniel
1990). To further knowledge on the dynamics that lead
to individual and organizational efforts to pursue opportunities, our paper focuses speciﬁcally on the ﬁrst phase:
the process of recognizing opportunities.
Building on these considerations, we deﬁne the process of recognizing opportunities as efforts to make
sense of signals of change (e.g., new information about
new conditions) to form beliefs regarding whether or
not enacting a course of action to address this change
could lead to net beneﬁts (for instance, in terms of profits, growth, competitive jockeying, and/or other forms
of individual or organizational gains). The outcome of
this process lies in those subjective ex ante beliefs that
an opportunity exists—or not—for the willing and able
(Shepherd et al. 2007). Thus, it is possible to complete

415

the process of recognizing opportunity and still come to
believe that enacting a course of action to address this
change does not constitute an opportunity for yourself
or your ﬁrm.

Structural Alignment and the Recognition
of Opportunities

Baron (2006, p. 109) proposed that “individuals notice
various events in the external world  and then utilize
cognitive frameworks they have developed through experience to determine whether these events are related in
any way—whether, in short, they form a discernible
pattern.” Along this line, Baron and Ensley (2006,
p. 1339) showed that the opportunity prototypes of
expert entrepreneurs are richer than those of novices and
place greater emphasis on desirable attributes, such as
“solving a customer’s problems, the ability to generate
positive cash ﬂow, the speed of revenue generation, manageable risk, and (the presence of) others in their network with whom to develop the venture” the ability to
generate positive cash ﬂow, manageable risk, superiority
of the product/service, potential to change the industry, a
favorable ﬁnancial model, positive assessments or advice
from others, the existence of a large untapped market,
and intuition or gut feeling. But this raises an interesting conundrum. Given the retrospective nature of their
study, it is still not clear whether novices and experts
alike effectively use these desirable attributes in their
efforts to recognize opportunities.
We advance that a key to this conundrum lies in considering the cognitive processes by which individuals
make sense of new information, and more speciﬁcally, of
information that is new to them. It is commonly accepted
that people will mentally compare this new information
with what they already know. This is how we make sense
of new information. Seen in this light, the “discernment” of opportunity-relevant patterns involves cognitive
efforts to consider the “resemblance” between events in
the outside world (including signals of potential changes
in this environment) and mental models of situations
and contexts that are relevant not only for making sense
of the new information, but, in the case of recognizing opportunities, for identifying a course of action to
potentially proﬁt from these changes.
But how is this done concretely? What are the cognitive processes by which individuals assess resemblance
between new information and what they already know?
The question of “resemblance” has been at the center of
cognitive research on the perception of similarity, and
on the use and consequences of similarity considerations in a wide range of reasoning tasks (cf. Holyoak
and Thagard 1995). This literature highlights that perceptions of similarity between two or more objects of
interest rest on the cognitive alignment of the mental
representations that individuals make of these objects

<-----Page 3----->416

Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition

(Day and Gentner 2007, Keane et al. 1994, Markman
and Gentner 1993). Building on this literature, we propose that the cognitive process of structural alignment
(Gentner 1983, 1989) provides a useful basis to investigate the process of recognizing of opportunities. At its
most fundamental level, structural alignment is a cognitive tool that people use to compare things—and to
draw implications from the comparison. For instance,
when people encounter a new object, their ﬁrst instinct
is to ask whether anything in this new object resembles
anything they have seen before. In turn, people build
on the similarities they observe to better understand the
new object. Cognitive scientists have shown that similarity comparisons and the underlying mechanism of structural alignment play an important role in how people
make sense of new information, learn new concepts, and
develop categories (cf. Holland et al. 1986, Vosniadou
and Ortony 1989). More importantly, the same preocesses of structural alignment were shown to inﬂuence
the performance of activities that demand high levels
of abstract reasoning such as in scientiﬁc innovation,
new product ideation, and other creative endeavors (cf.
Dahl and Moreau 2002, Dunbar 1993, Ward 1995)—
and including strategy making (Gavetti and Rivkin 2005,
2007).
One of the primary ﬁndings of this research is that
alignment proceeds at two distinct levels: one centered
on the superﬁcial features and the other on structural
relationships (Gentner 1983, 1989). Superﬁcial features
relate to the basic “parts” of a mental representation,
along with their attributes and characteristics (Gentner
et al. 1995, p. 271). By contrast, structural relationships refer to the links that unite different superﬁcial
features within a mental representation. Research distinguishes two types of structural relationships: ﬁrst-order
and higher-order structural relationships. The former
consists of one-to-one functional relationships between
superﬁcial features (e.g., action verbs, direct effects).
Higher-order relationships include more abstract “relationships between relationships,” such as causal chains,
goal statements, and conditional rules (cf. Gentner 1989,
Gentner et al. 1993, Holyoak 1985).
We use the example of a new technology developed at
MIT—the 3DP™ documented in Shane (2000)—to illustrate the distinctions between superﬁcial features and
structural relationships. Examples of superﬁcial features
of the technology include who developed the technology (mechanical engineers at MIT), the components of
the technology (mechanical arm, print head), the material it uses (ceramic powders), and what the technology
produced in the lab (e.g., ceramic ﬁlters, casting molds,
etc.). Examples of ﬁrst-order structural relationships
include how the technology operates (e.g., [mechanical arm (moves) print head]; [print head (deposits)
powder]). Higher-order structural relationships include
more abstract capabilities of the technology (e.g., [how

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

the technology operates] causes [fabrication of tridimensional objects with high level of automation and
precision]).
Structural alignment processes play an important role
in efforts to make sense of new information: faced with
a new target stimulus, individuals consider the alignment of its features and relationships with that of a relevant “source” (Gentner 1989, Holland et al. 1986). This
“source” can be a relevant object, a more abstract framework (such as a category or a theoretical model), or more
generally, a mental representation of a situation that is
relevant to understanding the new information target. By
comparing the new information with a relevant object,
model, or situation—that is, by considering whether or
not the superﬁcial features and structural relationships
of target and source are aligned—people are able to perceive meaningful patterns and draw relevant conclusions.
This leads to the following guiding proposition:
Proposition 1. In their efforts to recognize opportunities, individuals will mentally compare the superﬁcial
features and structural relationships of signals from their
environment with the features and relationships of contexts where this information could be meaningful.
Preponderant Role of Aligning
Structural Relationships
Research on structural alignment indicates that the processing of superﬁcial features and of structural relationships involves different sets of cognitive structures and
dynamics (Gentner 1989, Gentner et al. 1993, Keane
et al. 1994). As a result, the two are likely to play different roles in efforts to recognize opportunities. On the
one hand, research has shown that superﬁcial features
inﬂuence the search and retrieval of information from
memory (Gentner 1989, Gentner et al. 1993). Accordingly, the superﬁcial features of a new stimulus (say,
the features of a new technology such as the material it
works with) may lead one to recall corresponding features of a relevant source from memory (in this case,
a market associated with this material). The source that
is recalled from memory is often inﬂuenced by one’s
prior experiences or familiarity with particular features,
or by one’s context or situation (for instance, a feature
that is made salient because of particular events). This
may narrow the range of superﬁcially related domains
that are spontaneously accessed (Keane et al. 1994) and
where one scans for relevant bases for alignment. On
the other hand, structural relationships are more directly
involved in higher-order reasoning processes (Holland
et al. 1986, Keane et al. 1994). For instance, the processing and alignment of structural relationships inﬂuence
category formation (Namy and Gentner 2002), learning
(Loewenstein and Gentner 2005), and problem solving
(Catrambone and Holyoak 1989, 1990).
Both superﬁcial features and structural relationships
can inﬂuence interpretation. Yet, research has shown

<-----Page 4----->Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

that structural relationships are particularly important
when making inferences about a new and/or ambiguous
stimulus (Day and Gentner 2007, Gentner 1989). Accordingly, we postulate that efforts to recognize opportunities will emphasize the consideration and alignment of
structural relationships. Two further reasons motivate this
emphasis. First, reasoning based on structural relationships is fostered when stimuli are encoded in a rich
and deep manner, such as in cognitively demanding
tasks or when facing an emotionally important challenge (cf. Blanchette and Dunbar 2001, Catrambone
and Holyoak 1989). These conditions characterize most
efforts to recognize opportunities. The relevant information for such tasks is often complex and ambiguous,
making its interpretation challenging. Likewise, these
tasks are emotionally engaging, in large part because of
the potential consequences they have for individuals and
their ﬁrm (cf. Cardon et al. 2009, Ireland et al. 2003).
Second, research has shown that from a neurocognitive standpoint, noticing the alignment of structural relationships generates more “brain activation” than does
noticing the alignment of superﬁcial features (Holland
et al. 1986, Keane et al. 1994). This preference for
structural matches allows for comparing and recognizing meaningful patterns that may not include superﬁcial
similarities. Indeed, the use of structurally based “mental
leaps” (Holyoak and Thagard 1995) has been observed
in several ﬁelds, and notably in scientiﬁc and creative
thinking (e.g., Dahl and Moreau 2002, Dunbar 1993,
Ward 1995). In strategic decision making for instance,
Gavetti and Rivkin (2005) showed that former Intel CEO
Andrew Grove ﬁgured out the danger of abandoning the
low-end microprocessor segment not by thinking about
the situation in computer or electronic products, but by
comparing Intel’s situation with what had happened in
the steel industry with the advent of Nucor and the minimills. Microprocessors and reinforcing bars have few
features in common, but Nucor’s entry and growth in the
steel industry was highly similar to the Advanced Micro
Devices, Inc. (AMD) entry and growth in the microprocessor industry. Knowing what happened to large U.S.
steel foundries, Grove devised a strategy to avoid a similar fate. The above considerations suggest that in their
efforts to recognize opportunities, individuals will pay
particular attention to the alignment of structural relationships, relative to their alignment of superﬁcial features. Thus, the following applies.
Hypothesis 1. The process of recognizing opportunities will involve greater cognitive effort (attention) to
align structural relationships than to align superﬁcial
features.
Role of Prior Knowledge
Extant research has shown that because the distribution
of knowledge in society is not uniform, prior knowledge helps to explain why some individuals are able

417

to recognize particular opportunities that others simply
fail to see (e.g., Corbett 2005, Dimov 2007b, Fiet 1996,
Shane 2000, Shepherd and DeTienne 2005). In general, these studies infer that prior knowledge provides a
basis from which to interpret—and use—new information. However, because of the indirect and retrospective
nature of the empirical evidence (cf. Davidsson 2006,
Dimov 2007b), most of these studies do not specify the
cognitive mechanism by which prior knowledge effectively inﬂuences efforts to recognize opportunities.
Cognitive research indicates that prior knowledge fosters the consideration of structural relationships. For
example, experts in a domain ﬁnd it naturally easier
to reason in terms of structural relationships, in large
part because they have richer mental representations
with which to work (Chi et al. 1981). Knowledgeable
experts are more readily able to solve problems with
low superﬁcial similarity but high structural similarity (Gick and Holyoak 1983, Keane 1988). In parallel, research on insight has shown that one’s failure to
solve a particular problem often leaves “failure indices”
in long-term memory. According to the “opportunisticassimilation hypothesis” of Seifert et al. (1995), such
indices lay dormant until a chance encounter with a
stimulus relevant to solving the problem, at which time
these indices “serve as signposts that guide subsequent
retrieval processes back to stored aspects of the problematic situation” (Seifert et al. 1995, p. 87). In other
words, prior exposure to a problem can increase alertness to solution-relevant stimuli (Dimov 2004). The
implications of the “richer mental representations” and
“opportunistic-assimilation” perspectives are that prior
knowledge facilitates the noticing of structural parallels
between new information and a relevant context, even in
the absence of superﬁcial correspondence between the
two. Thus, the following applies.
Hypothesis 2. In the process of recognizing opportunities, reliance on higher levels of prior knowledge will
be associated with greater cognitive effort (attention) to
align structural relationships than to align superﬁcial
features.

Research Methodology

In developing the model and hypotheses above, our
purpose is not to document the particular sequence of
thoughts that one follows to recognize opportunities, but
rather to test whether the process of recognizing opportunities involves discrete forms of reasoning. To this
aim, we conduct a verbal protocol study (Ericsson and
Simon 1993). Speciﬁcally, we met with senior executives that had new-venture founding experience, presented them with short descriptions of new technologies,
and asked them to “think out loud” as they considered
what possible opportunities could be pursued with these
new technologies (if any). Participants completed two

<-----Page 5----->418

Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition

exercises, using two different technologies. In turn, we
content analyzed the transcriptions of participants’ verbalized thoughts for evidence that in their efforts to recognize opportunities they used cognitive processes of
alignment.
Verbal protocol analysis allows one to observe the
thought processes of executives in real time while they
attempt to recognize opportunities, as opposed to relying on retrospective recollections of such efforts. In
organization research, the technique has been used to
study the reasoning strategies of managers and corporate
ofﬁcers (e.g., Isenberg 1986, Melone 1994), the decision processes of investors (e.g., Hall and Hofer 1993,
Sarasvathy et al. 1998), the thinking that supports new
product ideation (e.g., Dahl and Moreau 2002), and the
decision modes of entrepreneurs (e.g., Sarasvathy 2001).
Research Material
We derived the research material from publicly available
descriptions of two new technologies already exploited
in niche markets. The ﬁrst stimulus was based on
NASA’s Extended Attention Span Training (EAST™ )
(NASA 2003). The second was based on MIT’s threedimensional printing (3DP™ ), the same technology studied in Shane (2000). We present the research material in
the appendix.
We acknowledge that opportunities for new technologies are only a subset of the types of opportunities
that individuals and organizations may pursue. We chose
to anchor our research on the well-documented context of technology transfer (Mowery et al. 2004; Shane
2001a, b) to control for dynamics that may be associated
with different forms of opportunity in different situations and contexts. We designed the study to be consistent with prior accounts of technology transfer—where
entrepreneurs learn of technologies that are offered for
licensing and subsequently identify opportunities for
these (Shane 2000). Furthermore, our design makes use
of real-life technologies for which opportunities were
already exploited, thereby augmenting the external validity of our task and material.
Sample
We conducted the study with senior executives with
new-venture founding and managing experience in two
industries: life-science technologies and marketing services. We chose executives with new-venture experience
because the task of recognizing opportunities is one with
which they are familiar. Consistent with Ericsson and
Simon (1993), this ensures that participants’ verbalizations will not be affected by their need to cope with a
new or incongruous task. In addition, the selection of
participants from two distinct groups with markedly different backgrounds allowed us to broaden the generalizability of our ﬁndings.

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

Because our research exercise drew from authentic
cases of technology transfer, however, it was important
to select participants who were unlikely to have prior
knowledge of the current exploitation of these technologies. To minimize this possibility, we focused on executives who do not operate technology-related businesses
and who are unlikely to have engineering backgrounds.
As a post-experimental control, we asked participants
to report the prior knowledge they had of the speciﬁc
technologies we presented them, as well as the scientiﬁc
principles underpinning these techonologies.
To identify potential participants, we consulted a list
of 152 entrepreneurs operating businesses in a U.S.
mountain state, and who had professional relationships
with a university’s entrepreneurship center. We identiﬁed ﬁve executives with experience in marketing services, and one with experience in life sciences. A second
executive with experience in life sciences was identiﬁed
from a personal contact and that person suggested three
additional names. All 10 executives were contacted via
e-mail with a detailed message explaining the study’s
purpose and procedures. Nine agreed to take part. The
one who refused (female, 35–44 years old) cited “lack
of time to meet for such an extensive procedure.”
Participants include two males and two females heading marketing services ﬁrms, and four males and one
female executives from life-science businesses. All had
decades of work experience, including several years as
an entrepreneur (mean = 18.6 years): all had founded
and managed at least one new venture. All but two were
the founders (and lead executive) of the current ﬁrm in
which they work. The exceptions had previous founding experience and were members of their current ﬁrm’s
executive team (vice president and chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer
(CFO)). By and large, participants stated that they had
low levels of prior knowledge for the technologies we
presented (mean of 2.39 and 1.50 for the two technologies (EAST™ and 3DP™ ), respectively, on a nine-point
scale anchored 1 = “minimal knowledge,” with standard
deviations of 1.9 and 0.8). By contrast, they expressed
having more knowledge of the markets they discussed
(mean = 5.03; std. dev. = 2.7).
Given the demanding nature of the procedures, verbal protocol studies tend to trade large sample sizes
that would warrant statistical validity for methodological strategies that emphasize the internal, construct, and
external validity of the observations. In this regard, our
sample size of nine executives is directly comparable
to that of other verbal protocol studies in management
research, including Isenberg’s (1986) sample of 12 general managers from six corporations, Melone’s (1994)
sample of eight corporate development VPs and CFOs
(ﬁve and three, respectively), and Sarasvathy et al.’s
(1998) sample of eight entrepreneurs and bankers (four
and four, respectively). All participants completed two
exercises for two different technology stimuli, generating a total of 18 analyzable protocols.

Data Collection and Research Procedures
Each executive in our study completed the exercises at a
scheduled meeting, which lasted 40 to 50 minutes. Our
research procedures follow those set forth in Ericsson
and Simon (1993). We ﬁrst presented the participants
with two practice problems. We then asked whether
they were comfortable with the procedures, including the
recording of their think-aloud verbalizations. After conﬁrmation, we presented them the written description of
a ﬁrst technology (randomly assigned). Participants read
the description out loud and proceeded with the exercise.
Although some participants voiced comments as they
were reading the description, others read the description in its entirety without pausing. All participants then
described what possible opportunity(ies) could be pursued with the new technology (if any). At any time, they
could ask questions or interrupt the study. Participant’s
verbalizations (including reading the stimulus) ranged
from two and a half to 10 minutes. Once they had ﬁnished describing their thoughts, they were asked to indicate on one to nine scale the extent to which they had
prior knowledge of the technology presented, of the market(s) they discussed, and of the problems affecting individuals in those market(s). We then asked participants
whether they could do a second exercise. All agreed.
After completing the two exercises, participants completed a questionnaire that asked for information about
themselves and their current ﬁrm. The ﬁrst author transcribed each recording in the days following each interview, and sent a veriﬁcation copy to each respondent.
Data Analysis and Coding Schemes
We analyzed participants’ verbalization using content analysis techniques (Krippendorff 2004, Neuendorf
2002). In line with Crutcher (1994) and Ericsson and
Simon (1993), the coding schemes we introduce below
focus on the occurrence of discrete forms of reasoning
across participants’ verbalizations, and not on idiosyncratic variations that would be speciﬁc to the particular
thoughts of each participant. Consistent with other prior
verbal protocol studies (e.g., Isenberg 1986, Melone
1994, Sarasvathy 2001, Sarasvathy et al. 1998), evidence
for our hypotheses comes from the number, length, and
relative proportion of participants’ verbalizations that
reﬂect their use of alignment processes and prior knowledge. We use logistic regression techniques to assess the
predominance of structural alignment reasoning and the
role of prior knowledge in supporting this process.
Following Ericsson and Simon (1993, p. 205), our unit
of analysis consists of meaningful blocks of texts, generally a sentence or groups of related clauses that “ﬂowed”
together in participants’ verbalizations and that were separated from other statements by short pauses. We identiﬁed these statements as we transcribed the audio recordings, and veriﬁed them after all protocols had been transcribed. The 18 protocols generated 396 statements, each
averaging 12.65 seconds (std. dev. = 9.7s).

419

We coded the verbal protocols on three dimensions:
(1) the attention focus (i.e., the “topic” of each
statement); (2) the level of structural reasoning (i.e.,
superﬁcial versus structural); and (3) the level of
prior knowledge anchoring different statements. Table 1
describes how we operationalized each dimension. We
used subdimensions to translate the analytical categories
into concrete terms.
The ﬁrst dimension identiﬁes the particular aspect
of the problem space that captured participants’ attention. Because we focus on the process(es) of recognizing opportunities for new technologies, the relevant
problem space consists of information about the speciﬁc technologies we present participants, and whatever
objects, models, situations, or contexts participants use
to “make sense” of these technologies. We coded each
statement according to whether it referred to something
about the technology (the supply side), about the market
(the demand side), about both, or about neither (something else). Evidence of cognitive alignment comes from
statements that attend to features/relationships of both
technology and market. Yet we note that our research
design does not ask participants to align technology and
markets: whether they do so is an empirical question,
one that we investigate in this paper.
The second dimension of our coding scheme captures the level of reasoning expressed in each statement.
More speciﬁcally, we coded each statement according
to whether it made an explicit reference to superﬁcial
features or to one of two types of structural relationships: ﬁrst or high order. Please note that we combine
the two forms of structural relationships for the quantitative analyses.1
The third dimension captures the level of prior knowledge that anchors the thoughts and reasoning strategies
evidenced in each statement. We distinguished between
three levels of prior knowledge: high, medium, and low.
Because participants were unlikely to have extensive
knowledge of the technologies but were free to use any
other knowledge base in their efforts to recognize opportunities, the high levels of prior knowledge we observed
were mostly concerned with prior knowledge of markets.
For control purposes, we also noted the point in time
within each protocol before which participants were
“searching” for an application of the new technology,
and after which they had “identiﬁed” a speciﬁc opportunity for that technology. This allows us to assess the relative distribution of content categories before and after
participants explicitly identiﬁed an opportunity.
Dependent Measures
To document the absolute and relative occurrence of
structural alignment processes in participants’ efforts to
recognize opportunities, we calculated three dependent
measures consistent with prior use of verbal protocols in
management research (cf. Isenberg 1986, Melone 1994,

protocol to report the number of participants who made
at least one statement corresponding to our coding categories. We also report the number of participants who
made two statements or more. Similar in spirit to the
Borda-count method used by Sarasvathy (2001), this
approach allowed us to assess whether the importance
given to each category is generalized across our participants. The second measure focuses on the total length of
time (in seconds) devoted to different categories of statements within each protocol. The third measure captures
the relative importance of each category of statements
over the duration of the “average” protocol. To construct
this measure, we ﬁrst calculated the relative importance
of each category of statement with respect to the length
of each participant’s protocols (in percentage of total
time). We then calculated the weighted average of these
measures controlling for the length of individual protocols. This measure provides a conservative estimate of
the importance that particular forms of reasoning have
within participants’ verbalizations, net of whether some
individuals were more or less loquacious.

space limitations prevent us from reporting the results
here, participants’ retrospective verbalizations were
highly convergent with what they had said in the thinkaloud protocols. This observation supports the internal
validity of the protocols (Ericsson and Simon 1993,
Chapter 3).
Consistent with the standards of verbal protocol
and content analysis (cf. Krippendorff 2004, Neuendorf
2002), two coders independently coded the raw data: the
ﬁrst author and a graduate student who was blind to both
the theoretical rationales and particular hypotheses of
the study. The coders began by coding a single protocol
together and discussed every aspect of the coding procedure. They then coded two protocols independently, and
met back to discuss the objectivity and meaning of each
coding category. Having agreed, the two coded all 396
statements independently.
We calculated two indices of interrater reliability for
all coding dimensions: percentage of agreement and
Cohen’s . We reached the following levels of reliability: 95.9% agreement ( = 0935) for the attention focus
dimension, 83.4% agreement ( = 0801) for the level
of structural reasoning dimension, and 92.5% agreement
( = 0816) for the prior knowledge dimension. These
results indicate acceptable levels of interrater reliability
(cf. Lombard et al. 2002, Neuendorf 2002). The coders
discussed discrepancies and reached agreement on all
statements before conducting the ﬁnal analyses.

Results

The 18 protocols reveal a wide diversity in the sequence
of thoughts and reasoning strategies mobilized by participating executives in their efforts to recognize opportunities. Some had an idea right away and proceeded
to expand upon it. Some spent time considering various possibilities before they settled on a particular one.
Still others voiced hypotheses that they continued to
develop until they found an opportunity they felt conﬁdent to defend. And three participants did not identify an
opportunity for the 3DP™ technology—an observation
to which we will return.
Several participants indicated that although they would
need more information to assess whether they should try
exploiting the opportunity(ies) they had described, they
were conﬁdent that they had identiﬁed an opportunity
that could work.
Now I would have to do a lot of due diligence to convince
myself, as I would go forward in that analysis of whether
[the opportunity I described above] would work, but I am
prepared to say: “all right, let’s go to the next step, let’s
assume it works, now let’s ﬁgure out what commercial
opportunity that could be associated with this.” (M45bio
EAST™ )2

This indicates that the participant made an explicit distinction between efforts to recognize an opportunity and
the decision whether to exploit an opportunity. Interestingly, some of the applications they discussed proved
very similar to opportunities that are actually being pursued. Yet, participants discussed other applications that
appeared just as plausible.
The apparent diversity in reasoning strategies across
executives masks a number of regularities that are important for understanding the cognitive processes that are
used for recognizing opportunity. Table 1 reports the
results of our content analysis of the verbal protocols.
An initial look at this data points to several observations
that are consistent with structural alignment processes.
First, we observe that participants spent less time talking about the presented technologies than they spent
describing markets for these technologies. For the average protocol regarding NASA’s EAST™ technology, verbalizations for the technology alone accounted for 9.1%
(2.8% for superﬁcial and 6.3% for structural) of the total
time, whereas verbalizations about markets accounted
for 29.1% (7.6% for superﬁcial and 21.5% for structural). Similarly, for the average protocol regarding
MIT’s 3DP™ technology, verbalizations for the technology alone accounted for 9.5% (2.3% for superﬁcial and
7.2% for structural) of the total time, whereas verbalizations about markets accounted for 43.7% (4.0% for
superﬁcial and 39.7% for structural). We note that for
both technology-alone and market-alone statements, in
both sets of protocols, verbalizations about structural
relationships systematically accounted for larger proportions of the average protocol than verbalizations about

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

superﬁcial features (see Figure 1). Interestingly, larger
proportions of verbalizations focusing on superﬁcial features were made before a speciﬁc opportunity was recognized than for verbalizations focusing on structural
relationships. This suggests that the consideration of
superﬁcial features may be an initial reaction that triggers the search for technology–market combinations on
which to focus greater structural attention.
Second, we observe that though we never asked them
to do so, all participants spontaneously made statements
where the focus of attention is on both technology and
market—that is, statements whose meaning rest on the
parallels and similarities between a technology that was
presented and one or more market(s) in which to apply
this technology. For example:
And, so, for me to pursue a technology like this, and
try to understand if there is an opportunity (would be)
to apply the technology to create a new way to give athletes or weekend athletes, or weekend warriors, or people
who just care about physical activity, feedback on their
level of concentration and (whether) it correlated to their
performance so that they can see that when they were
concentrating and focused, what their performance did
and give them feedback on that. (F45mkt, EAST™ )
In manufacturing, you have people building things, and
if you can go from computer digital design straight to
3D objects, with the use of a robotic type machine, then
you’ve just eliminated a lot of labor involved in having to
do that through some manual means. (M45mkt, 3DP™ )

Third, we observe that although most participants
made statements denoting the alignment of superﬁcial
features (ﬁve of nine executives in the ﬁrst case, ﬁve
of six in the second), superﬁcial alignment accounted
for only a moderate proportion of the average protocol
length (11.2% for the EAST™ technology and 4.2% for
the 3DP™ technology).
Fourth, and by contrast, we observe that all executives made statements denoting the alignment of technologies and markets in terms of structural relationships
(nine of nine and six of six for the two technologies,
respectively). Figure 1 indicates that the alignment of
structural relationships accounted for 35.4% and 33.2%
of the average protocol length for the two technologies,
respectively. These ﬁndings indicate that in the process
of recognizing opportunities for new technologies, individuals pay attention to the structural alignment of technology and markets.
Consistent with the theory of structural alignment,
qualitative analyses revealed that participants’ alignment of structural relationships involved two kinds of
relationships: ﬁrst order and higher order. Participants’
alignment of ﬁrst-order relationships focused on how a
technology operates, and how/why people in a market
would use it.

A business-to-consumer, I can see it very much in the
gaming worlds, but not even electronic gaming, like I can
see it for people that are concentrating in world poker
tournament, and who are really trying to get focused on
that piece. (F35mkt EAST™ )
Like for instance, in a watch, there are little gears: well
that gear had to be made by somebody, cutting it out of a
piece of metal, and shaping it, and so I guess, this could
be used for making stuff like that, if it were the right
component. (M45mkt 3DP™ )

Finer-grained analyses indicate that the alignment of
ﬁrst-order relationships accounted for 13.5% and 19.6%
of the average protocol length for the EAST™ and 3DP™
technologies, respectively. For the two sets of protocols,
this corresponds to 38% and 59% of the time spent on
aligning structural relationships, respectively.
By contrast, participants’ alignment of higher-order
relationships was articulated in terms of the beneﬁts/capabilities of a technology, and the needs and problems of individuals in a given market.
Clearly, in technical surgical procedures, either done
directly by a surgeon or increasingly used by robotics,
which has a strong similarity to games, because they
can be done remote, not just remotely within an operating suite but remotely in terms of big geographical
differences, this whole sort of thing can be certainly
utilized, and therefore, any company that’s investing in

imaging, or surgical technology would have an interest
in utilizing an approach like this, to enhance the reproducibility, the predictability and the skills of the operator.
(M55bio1 EAST™ )
And in terms of architectural design and ﬁlling it with
space, I think that a lot of people don’t have an idea
of what that ﬁnished product is gonna look like, and
whether, it’s something you want to buy, and so, I think
that for most high-end commercial construction projects,
this would be deﬁnitely a big plus. It would also free you
from sticks and pieces of paper that models are made of
now. (F45bio 3DP™ )

The alignment of higher-order relationships counted for
21.9% and 13.6% of the average protocol length for
the EAST™ and 3DP™ technologies, respectively. This
corresponds to 62% and 41% of the total time devoted
to aligning structural relationships in the two sets of
protocols.
Taken together, these results indicate that in their
efforts to recognize opportunities for new technologies, individuals pay attention to aligning both types
of structural relationships, that is, ﬁrst-order relationships focused on the functional operation of technology
and markets, and high-order relationships focused on the
causal dynamics that underpin the beneﬁts and capabilities of new technologies, and the needs and problems of
individuals in a given market.

Hypotheses Testing
The columns in Figure 1 indicate that for both sets of
protocols, the average participant devoted more time to
align technology and market in terms of their ﬁrst- and
high-order structural relationships than in terms of their
superﬁcial features. Across protocols and technologies,
participants spent on average 108.7 seconds aligning
structural relationships compared to 25.7 seconds aligning superﬁcial features (t114 ; p < 0001). These ﬁndings
provide preliminary evidence for Hypothesis 1.
We used logistic regression to formally assess the relative attention devoted to aligning structural relationships
over superﬁcial features (Hypothesis 1) and the role of
prior knowledge in this process (Hypothesis 2). The tests
measure the odds that a randomly selected verbalization
from an average protocol focused on aligning structural
relationships as opposed to superﬁcial features. In all of
these tests, we controlled for differences between participants (eight dummy variables), between the two technologies scenarios (−05 for NASA’s EAST™ and 0.5
for MIT’s 3DP™ ), and for whether a statement was made
before or after a ﬁrst potential opportunity was identiﬁed
within an exercise (−05 for before; 0.5 for after).
The results reported in Table 2 provide support for
both Hypotheses 1 and 2. The results for Model 1 show
that in their efforts to recognize opportunities, executive entrepreneurs are more likely to make verbalizations
focusing on the alignment of structural relationships than
on the alignment of superﬁcial features (Model 1 intercept: likelihood coefﬁcient 	0 = 2249; p = 0033). In
other words, the odds that an average participant made a
statement aligning structural relationships are more than
nine times greater than the odds that she made a statement aligning superﬁcial features (Exp	0  = 9483).

Model 2 builds on these ﬁndings to assess the role
of prior knowledge in participants’ alignment of technology and market. Controlling for differences between
individuals, technology, and whether a statement was
made before or after a speciﬁc opportunity was identiﬁed, we ﬁnd that the greater likelihood of aligning
structural relationships as opposed to superﬁcial features
(Model 2: 	0 = 2940; p = 0008) augments signiﬁcantly
with linear increases in prior knowledge (	klin = 2105;
p = 0007). These results imply that, all else being equal,
the odds of aligning structural relationships (Exp	0  =
18918) are further augmented when participants rely
on high levels of prior knowledge (Exp	klin  = 8204).
These ﬁndings suggest that in the process of recognizing
opportunities, reliance on higher levels of prior knowledge is associated with greater cognitive effort (attention) to align structural relationships than to align superﬁcial features. These results support Hypothesis 2.
Additional Observations
Three executives in our study did not identify an
opportunity for the 3DP™ technology. Although our
research was not meant to explain why some individuals may fail to recognize opportunities, examination of
these participants’ verbalizations suggests that the sole
reliance on superﬁcial features may impede efforts to
recognize opportunities (one participant). Likewise, time
constraints (one participant) or prior experiences with
superﬁcially similar technologies (in this case prior difﬁculties one participant had in obtaining intellectual property protection for a superﬁcially similar technology)
may prevent one from attending to structural relationships (such as the structurally relevant reasons why the
capabilities of a new technology are unique and/or different from older ones). Although limited, these observations point to promising avenues of future research on
when and why the process of recognizing opportunities
may prove particularly challenging. We return to these
questions below.

Discussion

Through this study, we sought to develop a better understanding of the cognitive process(es) that individuals use
in their efforts to recognize opportunities. The results
from analyzing 18 verbal protocols from nine executive
entrepreneurs as they sought to recognize opportunities
for two different technological innovations provide evidence that recognizing opportunities involves cognitive
processes of structural alignment. We also demonstrate
that drawing on prior knowledge facilitates these processes. Prior to discussing these results, it is important to
emphasize that the signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings lies not in
observing that executive entrepreneurs ﬁnd opportunities
by matching technology with market, but rather that their
matching of technology and market involves their aligning the superﬁcial features and structural relationships

<-----Page 12----->Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition
Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

of technology and market to one another. Furthermore,
we ﬁnd evidence that aligning superﬁcial features plays
a different role in the process of recognizing opportunities than aligning structural relationships, with different
consequences.
Cognitive Processes of Recognizing Opportunities
Prior research has argued that the identiﬁcation of
opportunities involves pattern recognition (Baron 2006,
Baron and Ensley 2006). Although these studies have
made important advances, the particular processes used
in recognizing opportunities have not been sufﬁciently
developed theoretically, nor have they been directly
investigated empirically. Our study is among the ﬁrst
to develop and test a model that focuses speciﬁcally
on the cognitive processes involved in recognizing
opportunities.
Our results contribute direct evidence about the kind
of mental connections that are involved in the process of recognizing opportunities. More speciﬁcally, the
pattern of qualitative and quantitative ﬁndings from
our study is consistent with a structural alignment
model of opportunity recognition and suggests that these
cognitive processes are critical to recognizing opportunity. In general terms, we found that when executive
entrepreneurs encountered information about a new technology, they considered the “similarities” between this
information and context(s) where this information might
be meaningful. Furthermore, different types of similarities were involved in the process, each with different consequences. Some similarity comparisons concern
the superﬁcial features of markets and technologies.
Consistent with research in cognitive psychology (cf.
Gentner 1989, Keane et al. 1994), our results suggest
that these features serve to guide initial efforts to search
for domains and situations that provide relevant bases
for evaluating the meaning of the stimulus (in this case,
ﬁnding market domains that could be aligned with the
technology). In this regard, however, and still consistent
with psychology research, our results indicate that the
bulk of efforts to make sense of new information and
interpret whether a technology–market match constitutes
a potential opportunity relied predominantly on the consideration and alignment of structural relationships. In
other words, we found that in their efforts to recognize opportunities, participants considered the alignment
between how a technology operates and the cause–effect
principles explaining the beneﬁts and advantages of a
technology, with what individuals in a market do, why
they do it, and the cause–effect relationships accounting
for the unsatisﬁed needs and problems in that market.
Most importantly, we found that noticing parallels
between higher-order relationships appears to be a critical step in the process of recognizing opportunities.
Three lines of evidence support this observation. First,

we observed that if participants made some verbalizations emphasizing the parallels between the superﬁcial
features of markets and technologies, they devoted considerably more cognitive attention to aligning the structural relationships between markets and technologies,
and particularly the aligning of high-order structural
relationships. Second, we found that, in several cases,
executives thought of opportunities where the markets
and technologies shared high levels of structural relationships but low levels of superﬁcial features. In other
words, executives’ reliance on the alignment of structural relationships allowed them to “transfer” the technologies “across domains” and think of opportunities
that were not “superﬁcially obvious.” Third, we observed
that when more emphasis was placed on the superﬁcial elements of a stimulus than on its structural relationships, it became more difﬁcult to think of potential
opportunities. The same difﬁculties arose when other
matters interfered with the consideration of these structurally relevant capabilities (such as when a participant focused on evaluating the feasibility of intellectual property protection for the technology and when
another became concerned with time constraints). Taken
together, these lines of evidence converge on the notion
that, although superﬁcial elements may guide initial
reasoning about new information, reasoning about the
alignment of structural relationships plays a critical role
in efforts to recognize opportunities.
Our results regarding the importance of higher-order
structural similarities provides a cognitive explanation for why the detection of opportunity-relevant patterns has been found to be a challenging task (cf.
Chattopadhyay et al. 2001, Dutton 1993, Julian and
Ofori-Dankwa 2008). Research has documented that the
processing of structurally relevant information is cognitively more demanding than the processing of superﬁcial
features (Keane et al. 1994). To begin with, one needs
to attend to a variety of potentially relevant signals from
the environment (Ocasio 1997). But more critically, one
needs to have the necessary energy to encode and process these signals at the deeper level of structural relationships. At the same time, the complexity of the task,
particularly in dynamic industries, may make it quite
challenging for managers to ﬁnd the cognitive energy to
process relevant signals at a deeper level. By drawing
attention to the underlying mechanisms that underpin the
recognition of opportunities, we contribute a framework
for investigating the factors that facilitate (or inhibit) the
process.
Our results also contribute a better speciﬁcation of
the cognitive processes involved in efforts to recognize
opportunities. It has been advanced that entrepreneurs
use prototypes and exemplars of “ideal” opportunities to
detect relevant patterns between seemingly unconnected
changes (Baron 2006). Contrary to the suggestions of
prototype-based models, however, it is telling that the

<-----Page 13----->426

Grégoire, Barr, and Shepherd: Cognitive Processes of Opportunity Recognition

executives in our study did not refer to other opportunities they knew about. Likewise, their verbalizations only
refer to one desirable attributes of opportunity prototypes
(cf. Baron and Ensley 2006, pp. 1337–8).3 To explain
this difference in ﬁndings, we advance that the attributes
highlighted in Baron and Ensley (2006) may be more
directly involved in the evaluation of whether a recognized opportunity is personally worth acting on, rather
than on the antecedent process of recognizing opportunities. We also observe that this explanation is methodologically more in line with the design of Baron and
Ensley’s (2006) study, which asked novice and experienced entrepreneurs to describe opportunities they have
recognized in the past.
Recognition of Opportunities and Prior Knowledge
Our results also provide important insights into the role
of prior knowledge in opportunity recognition. In line
with past research, we observe that the executives in our
study used their prior knowledge of markets to search
for and think of opportunities for new technologies. But
most importantly, our results document that this prior
knowledge is systematically associated with executives’
considerations and alignment of structural relationships.
As they drew on their prior knowledge of particular markets, the executives in our study came to emphasize not
the superﬁcial features of those markets, but the difﬁculties and challenges that these markets face. In doing so,
they made statements highlighting the causes and effects
of these difﬁculties, and then drew parallels between
these and the advantages and beneﬁts of the new technologies. In other words, they used their prior knowledge
of markets to “connect the dots” and draw meaningful
parallels between the causes and effects of the problems
they knew in some markets and the structurally relevant
capabilities of new technologies.
By providing direct evidence for the role of prior
knowledge in efforts to recognize opportunities, we contribute a conceptual explanation and empirical evidence
for why prior knowledge is so important. Not only is it a
relevant resource that provides one person with idiosyncratic advantages over other individuals (Fiet 1996),
prior knowledge is a cognitive resource that enables
individuals to focus on key structural parallels and to
think of opportunities in markets that share few superﬁcial features with the original context where the technology was originally developed. In other words, our
results show how and why prior knowledge enables some
entrepreneurs and managers to transcend the nonobviousness that may characterize some opportunities (Shane
2000). This complements recent research on the imprinting effect of founder knowledge (functional experience)
on organizational structure (Beckman and Burton 2008)
by focusing on a preceding step in the entrepreneurial
process.

Organization Science 21(2), pp. 413–431, © 2010 INFORMS

One highly relevant implication of this ﬁnding is to
provide cognitive grounds to explore when and why it
is important to have deep technical knowledge in certain areas—a question that is not only relevant for managers and entrepreneurs, but also for any investor or
executive who sponsors the pursuit of new opportunities.
For instance, nonexperts might come to overvalue some
opportunities because the strong superﬁcial similarities
that they perceive may not prove all that important. Likewise, they might undervalue less obvious opportunities
because they do not perceive strong superﬁcial connections between a new technology and its application. By
contrast, experts with deep technical knowledge are better placed to think of opportunities that call for making
strong structural connections in the absence of superﬁcial similarities—such as the transfer of new technologies across superﬁcially distant domains.
Recognition of Opportunities in Organizations
Although we conducted our tests at the individual level
of analysis and focused exclusively on the recognition of
entrepreneurial opportunities for new technologies, our
study has two important implications for future research
on the recognition of opportunities in organizations.
First, we contribute a cognitive explanation for the
equivocal ﬁndings of prior research on the categorization
of ambiguous signals as threats or opportunities. The
issue categorization literature has found convergent evidence that links the characteristics of negative valence,
potential for loss, and uncontrollability to an automatic
diagnosis of threat (Jackson and Dutton 1988). However, the same level of convergence has not been found
for the diagnosis of opportunities (Julian and OforiDankwa 2008). Building on our results, we speculate
that opportunity diagnosis involves more complex—and
less automatic—cognitive processes than research on
threat diagnosis may imply. Opportunity diagnosis may
require one to engage in the more demanding processes
of encoding issues at a structural level, and of seeking to align the structural relationships of that issue
with those of a relevant context. Faced with information
about a shift in a competitor’s behavior, for example,
managers may need to align the structural relationships
of this event with the structural relationships embedded
in the mental representation they have of their ﬁrm’s
resources and capabilities. To the extent that there is
sufﬁcient alignment, managers can recognize whether
this alignment points to a beneﬁcial course of action for
their ﬁrm. By contrast, the diagnosis of threats may rely
more directly on considerations of superﬁcial features,
the processing of which is, by deﬁnition, less demanding
and more automatic. The structural alignment perspective thus suggests that the diverging evidence regarding
threat and opportunity diagnosis results from the different kinds of cognitive processes involved in the two
activities.

Second, our emphasis on the cognitive processes used
in efforts to recognize opportunities points to promising avenues to extend our work from the level of individual managers to the level of the organizations. As
Dutton (1993, p. 351) pointed out, organizational routines and conditions may contribute to “put decisionmakers on automatic in their interpretation of strategic
issues.” Organization routines, systems, and policies
often focus the attention of organizational actors on discrete segments of the information environment (Gavetti
and Rivkin 2007, Ocasio 1997). But are there organizational routines, systems, and policies that encourage (or inhibit) the encoding of information stimuli at
the deeper level of structural relationships? What is
the nature of these routines and how do they differ
across organizations? And what are the consequences of
these routines on the process of recognizing opportunities? Do they allow for the detection of opportunityrelevant patterns across superﬁcially different contexts?
Are more and better opportunities identiﬁed faster, with
more certainty?
Like we did with the role of prior knowledge, we
advance that the cognitive framework we develop in
this research might be proﬁtably leveraged to investigate the moderating roles of organizational factors for
recognizing opportunities. For instance, it would be relevant to study whether organizational attributes like ﬁrmlevel knowledge, structural ﬂexibility, and/or dynamic
capabilities (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000, Gavetti 2005)
facilitate managers’ efforts to consider and align structural relationships in their efforts to recognize opportunities. By the same token, it would be relevant to
explore whether organizational abilities to process information (Kuvaas 2002, Milliken 1990), or the unique
resources, organizational slack, or strategy of a ﬁrm
(Chattopadhyay et al. 2001, Chen 2008, Thomas and
McDaniel 1990), have similar effects on managers’ reasoning about opportunity-relevant signals. In both cases,
we propose that interesting advances could be gained by
not only looking at the direct effects of organizational
factors on opportunity identiﬁcation, but also by considering the extent to which these factors facilitate or hinder
the cognitive process of recognizing opportunities.

one could investigate whether managers use structural
alignment processes when interpreting ambiguous issues
such as changes in their industry environment.
By its very design, our study focused managers’ attention on the presented stimuli, and encouraged them to
think creatively about potential opportunities. In practice, however, entrepreneurs and managers alike are
bombarded with information signals—only a few of
which they can reasonably attend to. Beyond the issue
of whether a particular signal is attended to, the cognitive load of the task may inﬂuence the extent to which
a manager uses structural alignment processes in his
or her efforts for recognizing opportunities. Indeed, our
study offered some evidence that when a manager was
stressed (time pressure) or otherwise preoccupied, structural alignment processes were not activated, and the
manager had a more difﬁcult time thinking of opportunities. Experiments that manipulate time pressure or the
number of competing tasks may be able to increase our
understanding of these factors.
Last, our design was meant to investigate common
patterns of thinking across executive entrepreneurs that
were familiar with the task of recognizing opportunities for new technologies and for which the task was
relevant. In this regard, it would be interesting to investigate whether individuals, teams, and/or organizations
with different levels of entrepreneurial experience use
different cognitive processes in their efforts to recognize
opportunities, and with what consequences.
Successful efforts to recognize opportunities may lead
to important beneﬁts for individuals, organizations, and
society. This study furthers our understanding of the cognitive processes used for recognizing opportunities. We
show that efforts to connect the dots between new technologies and markets involve similarity comparison and
structural alignment, and illustrate the role of knowledge in supporting these processes. By unpacking the
cognitive processes that lead to the detection of relevant patterns and the formation of opportunity beliefs,
we provide a basis to encourage further research on the
factors that foster (and impede) this important activity
for entrepreneurs and managers alike.

Limitations, Avenues for Future Research, and
Conclusion
Though we took great care to conduct our analyses with
rigor, important avenues for future research remain in
exploring the boundary conditions of our model and in
studying the factors that may facilitate (or limit) efforts
to recognize opportunities. To expand the ecological
validity of the ﬁndings, for instance, it would be relevant
to test the model with different types of opportunity signals than the technologies used here, such as information
about new market trends, or about new means of supply that are less “technological” in nature. By extension,

Appendix. Research Material
NASA develops new training tool for improving
people’s concentration skills

MIT develops a method for the rapid
fabrication of 3D objects

NASA has just announced the development of a new
technology that could revolutionize the way all sorts
of people could improve their attention and
concentration skills.

MIT has just announced the development of a new
technology that could revolutionize the way all sorts of
three-dimensional objects can be made rapidly,
directly from a CAD drawing.

The SMART® (Self-Mastery and Regulation Training) works
by making any computer game/simulation respond to
changes in the player’s pattern of brain activity.
Electroencephalogram neurofeedback sensors are attached
to the player’s body and brain. These sensors monitor
the player’s neurophysiological activity and send these
signals to a signal processing unit, which in turn is
connected to the computer game controller.

The 3DP™ works by building parts in layers, and out of
any material that can be obtained in powder (e.g.,
ceramics, metal, plasters, starch, some kinds of plastics,
etc.). Working from a computer drawing of the desired
object, a “slicing software” generates detailed
information regarding the structure of each layer. The
computer sends this information to the actual 3DP™
machine: the fabrication of the object takes place within
an enclosed chamber where the building ﬂoor is supported
on a piston, so that it can be moved up and down.

“In the program we designed,” says NASA Computer
Engineer Monica Rotner, “the simulation game becomes
easier to control when the player’s pattern of brain activity
indicates that he/she is focused. But if the player gets
bored, distracted, or unfocused, the computer makes the
game much harder to play. Interestingly, our tests show
that within weeks of repeated practice, this neurofeedback
technology can signiﬁcantly improve the player’s
concentration and attention skills.”
Initial tests have also shown that the SMART® technology
was compatible with a number of off-the-shelf computer
games and simulations.
Building on these successful results, NASA’s Technology
Transfer Center is actively seeking partnerships and
collaborations to commercialize its SMART®
neurofeedback training system.
The question is:
What business opportunity ies could you pursue with
this technology?

The process begins by spreading and compressing a
measured quantity of powder material at the surface of
the building ﬂoor. Using a technology similar to ink-jet
printing, a mechanical arm moves over the loose powder
and deposits a binder material at speciﬁc points,
effectively “gluing” the powder at the precise location
where the object is to be formed. Once a layer is formed,
the ﬂoor supporting the object is lowered a short
distance, so that a new layer of powder can be spread,
compressed, and glued. This layer-by-layer process
repeats until the part is completed; unbound powder is
then removed, thus revealing the ﬁnished object.
Comparison with other technologies has shown that the
3DP™ process is relatively faster, quieter, cheaper to
operate, and can allow for the fabrication of objects with
complex internal shapes, as long as there is a hole for the
powder to escape.
Building on these initial results, MIT’s Technological Transfer
Ofﬁce is actively seeking partnerships and collaborations
to commercialize its 3DP™ technology.
The question is:
What business opportunity ies could you pursue with
this technology?

To heighten the rigor of our analysis, we also distinguished
between explicit and implicit references, such as when a pronoun is used in lieu of a more complete description of this
or that aspect of the technology or market. Taken in isolation,
pronouns cannot indicate whether a statement expresses superﬁcial or structural concerns. To the extent that a pronoun is
used in the context of a larger statement, however, one can
infer the kind of alignment that mobilizes attention. Results
showed that the distribution of statements across explicit and
implicit categories of alignment was similar, giving us a basis
to combine the two in the results we provide below.

Please note that we follow each direct quotation from our
protocols with a label indicating the participant’s gender (male

(M)/female (F)), age range (35–44; 45–54; 55–64), sector
(marketing services (mkt)/life sciences (bio)), and the particular exercise that the quote is taken from (given the technology
stimulus: EAST™ /3DP™ ).

As a completely separate post hoc analysis, we content analyzed the verbal protocols in light of the attributes listed in
Baron and Ensley (2006, pp. 1337–1338). Results indicate that
participants used only one of the attribute categories associated with opportunity prototypes: solving customer problems.
Verbalizations for this category counted for 49.8% and 41.4%
of the average length of the two sets of protocols, respectively.
By comparison, verbalizations for other attributes counted for
2.6% of the protocol length, on average. This importance of
market considerations relative to other attributes of ideal pro-

totypes is consistent with our ﬁndings that participants’ efforts
to recognize opportunities rested on their structural alignment
of the presented technologies with markets where it would be
meaningful to use these technologies. A full description of the
method, analysis, and results for these post hoc analyses is
available from the ﬁrst author.
