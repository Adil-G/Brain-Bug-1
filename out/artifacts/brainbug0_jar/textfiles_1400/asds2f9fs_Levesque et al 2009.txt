Entrepreneurs’
Decisions on Timing of
Entry: Learning From
Participation and
From the Experiences
of Others
Moren Lévesque

Depending on the type of industry, an entrepreneur’s decision of when to enter an industry
may be a crucial one. The longer entrepreneurs wait, the more they learn from others.
However, by waiting, they reduce their ability to learn directly and the possibility of locking
in competitive advantages. We suggest that the optimal time of entry depends on the
hostility of the learning environment since the latter has an impact on dimensions of
performance, such as profit potential and mortality risk. The environment for entrepreneurial
learning is less hostile when the information to be learned is abundant and when learning
from others is relatively more effective at increasing performance than learning from participation. Our results suggest that delaying entry is desirable when the environment is less
hostile. Entrepreneurs, however, cannot wait forever. We show that, under some general
conditions, an optimal time of entry can be determined, and discuss the specific situations
in which, instead, multiple equilibria may arise.

Introduction
Existing literature suggests that firms gather information through direct participation
in the industry and/or vicariously from the experiences of others (Huber, 1991; Levitt &
March, 1988). Most existing works focus on how learning influences the decision to enter
the industry (Klepper, 1996; Nelson & Winter, 1982). To complement these works, we
study how the possibility of learning from participation or from others influences the
timing of entry given that a positive decision to enter has been made.
The distinction between learning from participation and from the experiences of
others is important. While some entry strategy studies have found learning to be positively
related to entry performance (Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard, 1990), there has not been

vicariously—and their trade-off—vary from industry to industry, and from entrepreneur to
entrepreneur depending on their relative learning speed. For example, some industries
may offer a steep experience curve where the amount of information learned from
participation early on is high but rapidly diminishes with industry maturity, whereas
others may have a flatter experience curve where later entry still provides ample opportunity to learn from participation. Such differences are likely to influence the timing of
entry decision and, therefore, not only the performance of individual entrepreneurs but
also the competitive structure of industries.
Although learning scholars (e.g., Cohen & Levinthal, 1989, 1990) have made a
significant contribution by showing that some environments enhance a firm’s ability to
learn while others diminish it, most studies have focused on either learning from participation or learning from the experiences of others. We contribute to this literature by
investigating the relative role of both sources of learning. Our work complements Gavetti
and Levinthal (2000) who use simulations to examine the role and interrelationship
between search processes that are based on individuals’ cognitive maps of action and
those that are experience based. Gavetti and Levinthal show that, although approximate,
these representations of learning still act as a powerful guide to initial search efforts and
usefully constrain the direction of subsequent search. Particularly in volatile, newer, or
highly dynamic industries, entrepreneurs operate under uncertainty and rely significantly
on environmental clues when making decisions (Aldrich, 1999). Thus, useful insights
about performance can be gained by investigating the learning captured by an entrepreneur before entry and after entry relative to the learning of later entrants.
To characterize the relative contribution of both forms of learning, we define and
identify the hostility of the learning environment and relate it to timing of entry decisions.
The environment for entrepreneurial learning is less hostile when the information to be
learned is abundant and when learning vicariously becomes relatively more effective at
increasing performance than learning from participation. The distinction between learning
from participation and learning from the experiences of others forms the basis of our
decision-theoretic model of entry timing. We show that, under certain conditions, comparing the information acquired by an entrepreneur before entry relative to the information
available to later entrants allows the identification of a unique optimal time of industry
entry which maximizes the entrepreneur’s expected performance as a function of profit
potential and mortality risk. A unique optimal time of entry, however, cannot always be
univocally determined, and two alternative scenarios are possible. In fact, although
increases in learning correspond to higher profit potential, mortality risk can be lower or
higher.
In scenario 1, delaying industry entry has an impact on learning and the higher the
learning (from participation or vicariously) the greater the profit potential and the lower
the mortality (bankruptcy) risk, both of which increase performance. Delaying industry
entry increases the amount of information that can be learned vicariously which, in turn,
increases profit potential and lowers mortality risk. The amount of information learned
from participation, however, is reduced, which decreases profit potential and increases
mortality risk. Thus, in scenario 1 there is a clear trade-off between what the entrepreneur
gains from the two types of learning, even though the two measures of performance (profit
potential and mortality risk) both improve as either type of learning increases. That is, an
increase in the amount of learning of either type increases profit potential and reduces
mortality risk. Under these circumstances, a unique optimal time of entry can be determined. The conditions under which that optimal time exists allow us to derive insights on
when entry should be delayed and when it should be expedited.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->There are situations, however, when mortality risk may increase with previous learning as a greater stock of existing information may channel new thinking down known
paths (e.g., Nystrom & Starbuck, 1984). Scenario 2 describes a situation in which a larger
stock of existing information increase the opportunity costs of innovation, reduces flexibility and, as a result, increase profit potential but also mortality risk. Under these
circumstances, a unique optimal time of entry cannot always be determined. Delaying
industry entry increases the amount of information that can be learned vicariously, which
increases both profit potential and mortality risk. The amount of information learned from
participation, however, is reduced, which, in this case, decreases both profit potential and
mortality risk.1 As a result, multiple equilibria may arise and entrepreneurs may find
themselves facing a significantly more complex entry decision.
Our study fills a gap in the literature by contributing to our understanding of how
different learning environments may influence the entry behavior of entrepreneurs. Specifically, our findings change the way we think about industry entry timing and entrepreneurial learning by considering simultaneously the fact that learning varies from
individual to individual and from industry to industry. In addition, our study provides new
insights for policy makers with respect to the type of behavior they can expect from
potential entrepreneurs in different industries.

Entrepreneurial Learning and Timing of Entry
Regardless of firm size, entry is an inherently entrepreneurial action. Lumpkin and
Dess (1996) write: “The essential act of entrepreneurship is new entry. New entry can be
accomplished by entering new or established markets with new or existing goods or
services. New entry is the act of launching a new venture, either by a start-up firm, through
an existing firm, or via internal corporate venturing” (p. 136). Kirzner (1979) defines
entrepreneurial knowledge as “a rarefied, abstract type of knowledge—the knowledge of
where to obtain information (or other resources) and of how to deploy it” (p. 8). Thus,
entrepreneurs’ information is molded by their subjective circumstances while their interests determine which elements of this information are relevant to their purposes. Clearly,
entrepreneurs are not independent from one another, and what they know is the outcome
of a process involving reciprocal observation, repetition, and experimentation that
increase their confidence in certain actions and improve their ability to make decisions.
Also, information is cumulative. What is learned in one period by someone builds upon
what was learned in an earlier period by someone else (Minniti, 2005).
There is a relatively large amount of literature on entrepreneurial learning and on how
entrepreneurs learn. Parker (2006) argues that there are several aspects to entrepreneurial
learning, namely, what entrepreneurs learn, why entrepreneurs learn, and how entrepreneurs learn. Minniti and Bygrave (2001) argue that what entrepreneurs learn relates to
conditions and opportunities in specific industries, and to how to be entrepreneurial in
general. Arrighetti and Vivarelli (1999) contend that the reason why entrepreneurs learn is
to increase the value of their ventures. Minniti and Bygrave also suggest that entrepreneurs learn through an ongoing adjustment process of their original plans and beliefs,
possibly by trial and error. This adjustment process is also supported by McGrath and
MacMillan (1995) who offer a practical tool converting (often wrong) assumptions made
1. This is consistent, e.g., with standard portfolio analysis in which systematic risk and expected profit are
negatively correlated but nonsystematic risk cannot be eliminated.

<-----Page 3----->by entrepreneurs about the unknown. Several other authors have argued that learning is
central to the entrepreneurial process (Harrison & Leitch, 2005). Among others, Cope
(2005) looked at the temporal phases of entrepreneurial learning, Lumpkin and Lichtenstein (2005) discussed the roles of behavioral, cognitive, and action learning in the
opportunity recognition process. Politis (2005) considered the role played by the entrepreneur’s experience. To our knowledge, no one has yet focused on our learning
dichotomy and the entry timing decision. Thus, we complement these works by suggesting that the learning process is also important for the timing of entry.
With respect to entry timing, most research on market entry indicates that timing is a
key factor for success. Numerous measures of performance have been used in entry timing
research, thus providing some guidance on what may influence the entry decision. These
measures include profitability (e.g., Abell & Hammond, 1979; Rothaermel, 2001), survival (e.g., Aaker & Day, 1986; Agarwal & Gort, 1996; Mitchell, 1989; Robinson & Min,
2002; Wernerfelt & Karnani, 1987), market share (e.g., Robinson, 1988; Robinson &
Fornell, 1985; Szymanski, Troy, & Bharadwaj, 1995; Urban, Carter, Gaskin, & Mucha,
1986), and multiple measures (e.g., Lambkin, 1988; Mitchell, 1991). In this article, we
conceptualize performance in terms of the combination of two dimensions: profitability
and exposure to mortality risk.
In addition, an impressive body of empirical regularities has emerged from the study
of firm-size distribution and the relation between firm growth rates and firm size. Klepper
and Graddy (1990), for example, present a model of how chance events and exogenous
factors influence the number of potential entrants in an industry, the growth rate of
incumbents, and the ease of imitation of industry leaders that influence the ultimate
number and size distribution of firms in the industry. Klepper (1996), instead, presents a
model emphasizing differences in firm innovative capabilities and the importance of firm
size in appropriating the returns from innovation. The model also explains regularities
regarding the relationship within industries between firm size and firm innovative effort,
innovative productivity, cost, and profitability, and predicts that, over time, firms devote
more effort to process innovation but the number of firms and the rate and diversity of
product innovation eventually wither. Unlike our work, the overall focus of Klepper’s
work is on industry structure and firms’ interdependence rather than on any individual
firm.
Also with a focus on industry structure and firms’ interdependence, Nelson and
Winter (1982) propose an evolutionary economics approach (an alternative to a neoclassical economics approach) for the study of economic growth. Because of their focus on the
evolutionary aspects of industry dynamics, Nelson and Winter stress the importance of the
time dimension and use various Markov processes to describe sequences of actions and
reactions. They generate results on the impact of entry timing on expected profitability as
a function of learning-by-doing (research and development and scale) and vicarious
learning (spillovers). However, their focus is not on the entrepreneurial decision and, as
such, they do not explicitly measure the effects of different types of learning on (mortality)
risk and the trade-off between risk and return. While Nelson and Winter study primarily
industry dynamics, our study focuses on the irreversible entry decision of a single
entrepreneur given the information available to her at a specific time and the hostility of
the learning environment.
Nelson and Winter (1982) take a neo-Schumpeterian view and argue that evolutionary
ideas provide a workable approach to the problem of elaborating industry dynamics as an
engine of progressive change. Their work allows researchers to address questions, such as
why is the state of knowledge what it is? How does it change over time? Is it the same for
all firms at the same time? These are question that standard decision theory cannot answer.
550

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->Decision theory, however, is very well suited to study a firm’s production set and decisions
for any given amount of information available. The decision when to enter the industry
falls within this group. Thus, we complement their work by studying with a different
method (decision theory) the details of a specific decision of the entrepreneur (when to
enter) at a given point in time.
The important point in our study of the effects of learning is that, unlike other
entrepreneurial choices that can be updated and emended, the decision to enter is a
one-shot action that cannot be repeated or improved upon. Thus, the effect of learning
on timing of entry contributes to an irreversible decision that does not have the characteristic of an updating process. When making decisions about when to enter the
industry, entrepreneurs take into account the advantage they may acquire upon their
competitors through learning from participation. This type of information requires the
explorations of a new course of action. In this first case, entrepreneurs learn by entering
the industry and by creating new, and possibly private, information. However, they also
consider the information they may acquire from observing others. In this second case,
entrepreneurs learn vicariously thereby exploiting preexisting and common knowledge.
The relative amounts and importance of personal and public information, however, as
well as the rate at which they become available are likely to differ from industry to
industry.
Importantly, our distinction between two venues of learning allows us to emphasize
the important distinction between “knowledge” and “information.” Knowledge is context
specific and is constantly changing while information is fixed (Boettke, 2002). Knowledge
emerges from the specific context in which individuals act and cannot be communicated
or observed. Information is a stock while knowledge is a flow, and the two concepts are
fundamentally different. This is an important point because entrepreneurs cannot possibly
know the knowledge they will learn outside the very process of learning. At any point in
time, however, the amount of information represents a state of the system. In our model,
entrepreneurs who postpone entry can learn from observing other entrepreneurs who are
already in the industry. In other words, they can learn from the stock of information
created by others. In an alternative, they can contribute to that stock of information by
entering the industry.
Finally, our distinction between learning from participation and learning vicariously
may be related to the distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge. In fact, learning
from participation is more likely to contribute to the accumulation of tacit knowledge,
whereas learning vicariously is more likely to be a way of acquiring explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge, as originally characterized by Polanyi (1966), is constructed from
individuals’ own experience in the world. Along similar lines, Nonaka and Kanno (1998)
have argued that tacit knowledge represents knowledge that people possess, while explicit
knowledge represents knowledge that can be codified in tangible forms. The vast body of
work related to these concepts is a testament of just how important they have become. The
unfortunate consequence of all this activity, however, is that the words have grown to
mean different things to different people, thus giving rise to some confusion and to strong
discrepancy between many of the ideas being proposed and Polanyi’s original concept.
Overall, our main concern is to view learning as occupying a central place in the
development of competitive advantages which, in turn, may influence performance. Thus
the exact definition of what learning from participation includes versus what learning
vicariously includes is beyond the scope of our paper. The focus of our paper is not to
identify what is included in the information set available to the entrepreneur at any point
in time, but on variations in the relative role played by different learning venues on the
decision about when to enter the industry.

<-----Page 5----->Analytical Framework
Learning From Participation and Vicariously
Let t represents the time when the entrepreneur is to enter, as measured by industry
age. Let Pt (>0) be the amount of information that can be accumulated from participating
in the industry from t (the time of entry) to some point F in the future at which the
entrepreneur will wish to (or will have to) evaluate the performance of her business.2 The
amount of learning the entrepreneur can accumulate from participating in the industry
decreases as entry is delayed because, by participating in the industry longer, early
entrants have more time to learn about the industry than later entrants (Burt, 1992; Feeser
& Willard, 1990). In addition, the rate at which learning from participation accumulates
increases at a decreasing rate (i.e., a decreasing concave relationship exists between Pt and
t) since, as it matures, the industry becomes more stable and predictable and there is less
new information to be learned.
Analytically, we express the information learned from participation as Pt = C - ctn,
n ⱖ 1, C > cFn. We select an exponent function because by varying the value of the
exponent n it is possible to “swipe” an infinite set of possible curves, making it easier to
transform our theoretical model into an empirically testable framework. c (>0) is the rate
at which the amount of information learned from participation decreases as entry is
delayed. C corresponds to the maximum amount of information that can be learned from
participating in the industry up until some point F in the future, when performance will be
evaluated. That is, C corresponds to the amount of information that can be obtained by the
industry’s pioneering entrepreneur who enters at t = 0. The lower bound condition on this
parameter insures that learning from participation stays nonnegative.3
An entrepreneur delaying entry does not learn from participation, but she does learn
vicariously from the experiences of others (Minniti, 2005). The information available in
the industry is a form of collective learning both within and outside the industry (Miner
& Haunschild, 1995). Let Vt (>0) be the total amount of information that can be learned
vicariously if the entrepreneur chooses to enter the industry at t. The amount of information that can be learned vicariously increases the longer entry is delayed, and can be
expressed as Vt = B + btm, m ⱕ 1, where we again select an exponent function because of
its flexibility. b (>0) is the rate at which the accumulation of information takes place and
B (ⱖ0) is the amount of information that can be learned vicariously by the industry’s
pioneering entrepreneur.4 The rate at which information accumulates as entry is delayed
increases at a decreasing rate (i.e., an increasing concave relationship between Vt and t)
since, as argued earlier, industries tend to become more stable and predictable as they
mature.5
2. F is likely to be larger for, e.g., a biotech innovation as compared to software development. Model
parameters such as F can be scaled accordingly to better capture the window of opportunity.
3. The amount of information gained from participation can be measured by the number of lessons learned
from the experience of being in the industry, and/or past production output (Epple, Argote, & Murphy, 1996).
4. Although learning vicariously may continue after entry, our focus is on how acquired information influences the irreversible commitments associated with entering the industry.
5. The amount of information learned from others’ experiences is challenging to measure. Scholars have used
the aggregate cumulative production output across all relevant organizational units (Argote, Beckman, &
Epple, 1990; Darr, Argote, & Epple, 1995). Vicarious learning could also be operationalized by: (1) the degree
to which entrepreneurs imitate products, services, and processes that have been successful in the past; (2) the
level and use of intellectual property protection, e.g., in some industries sharing information is more important
than keeping it proprietary; and/or (3) a survey of the industry’s pioneers or experts capturing how much a new
entrant can learn from their experiences.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Profit Potential and Timing of Entry
The profit potential of an entrepreneur is the discounted expected total return to her
business at some point F in the future when the performance of the venture is evaluated.
Early entrants can often achieve higher profit potential than later entrants because with
less competition they find it easier to gain customers (Karakaya & Kobu, 1994; Robinson,
1988) and because their industry share gains are worth more given their association with
increasing sales and lower competition (Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989; Golder & Tellis,
1993). Entrepreneurs who can learn (from participation or vicariously) faster are also
likely to achieve higher profits potential because of their ability to process available
information better and to incorporate it into their actions (Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard,
1990).
Thus, we express the profit potential of the entrepreneur if industry entry occurs at t
(the industry age) as pt = p0 - rt + f (pt,Vt). p0 is the profit potential of the pioneering
entrepreneur (not attributed to learning but to first mover advantage), r (>0) the direct
marginal loss of profit potential due to delayed industry entry and competition, and f a
nonnegative function measuring the influences of both types of learning on profit potential

accumulated learning (both vicariously and from participation), profit potential decreases
over time due to the direct effect of industry aging. However, as time passes, the levels of
accumulated learning also change. Specifically, as time passes, vicarious learning
increases and influences profit potential positively, learning from participation, on the
other hand, decreases and influences profit potential negatively. As a result, the two types
of learning cause a trade-off on profit potential and we cannot conclude that overall pt
decreases (or increases) as the time of entry t is delayed. Finally, the nonincreasing rate at
which pt increases with the amount of information accumulated from both types of
learning reflects diminishing marginal returns.
As argued earlier, exponent functions are promising because they make empirical
validation more feasible. We thus express the contribution of both types of learning to
profit potential as f ( Pt , Vt ) = μ [ Pt n1 + ν Vt n2 ] , where m > 0, n > 0, 0 < ni ⱕ 1, i = 1 or 2.
m is the marginal profit potential from total learning, whereas the parameter n determines
the contribution of learning from participation relative to learning from others’ to profit
potential. Specifically, an increase in n implies that the information learned vicariously
becomes more effective at increasing profit potential relative to the information learned
from participation. In other words, when the importance of vicarious learning increases
relative to that of learning from participation, profit potential increases and entrepreneurial
performance may improve as entry is delayed.

Mortality Risk and Timing of Entry
Mortality risk refers to the probability that the new business will not be profitable and
become insolvent and that, as a result, the entrepreneur will cease operations either by
entering bankruptcy or by ceasing operations to preempt bankruptcy.6 Similarly to profit

6. Mortality risk can be measured by an assessment of the likelihood of bankruptcy by an expert such as a
venture capitalist (e.g., Shepherd, 1999) and/or the mortality rate of entrepreneurs within the industry or a
similar industry (e.g., population ecology studies, such as Carroll & Delacroix, 1982).

<-----Page 7----->potential, for any given level of accumulated learning (both vicariously and from participation), mortality risk decreases over time due to the direct effect of industry aging
(Mitchell, 1991). Although changes in survival chances are unlikely to be smooth because
of, for example, environmental jolts (Venkataraman & Van de Ven, 1998), their behavior
may be reasonably approximated by an exponential function. Also, as time passes the
levels of accumulated learning change and, when considering mortality risk, two alternative scenarios are possible.7 In scenario 1, entrepreneurs who learn faster may be able to
reduce their mortality risk more quickly by being able to assess more accurately the
external environment and adapt accordingly their actions. In scenario 2, instead, past
learning creates inertia that channels thinking down known paths. Entrepreneurs finding
themselves in such a situation may be unable to adapt and reduce mortality risk and,
instead, see it increase.
Given the description above, we express mortality risk when the entrepreneur enters
the industry at t as rt = ge-ht + g(Pt,Vt). g (>0) measures the effect of industry age on
mortality risk, h (>0) is the exponential rate at which that mortality risk directly decreases

scenario 1 the entrepreneur’s mortality risk when she enters the industry at t decreases at
a nonincreasing rate (in absolute value) with the amount of information accumulated from
both types of learning, reflecting the fact that mortality risk decreases as either type of
learning increases. In scenario 2, instead, mortality risk increases at a nondecreasing rate
with the amount of previous learning (reflecting a sort of “competence trap”). Note also
that delaying entry has a direct effect on mortality risk (reduced because of increased
industry maturity), but also has indirect effects due to (1) an increase in the amount of
information learned vicariously; and (2) lost opportunities to learn from participation. In
other words, we cannot conclude in either scenario that overall rt decreases (or increases)
as entry is delayed.
As in the case of profit potential, we utilize exponent functions and express the
contribution of both types of learning to mortality risk as g ( Pt , Vt ) = G − τ S1 [ Pt n3 + θ S1Vt n4 ]
for scenario 1 and g ( Pt , Vt ) = τ S2 [ Pt n3 + θ S2Vt n4 ] for scenario 2, where tS1 > 0, tS2 > 0,
qS1 > 0, qS2 > 0, G > τ S1 [ P0n3 + θ S2VFn4 ], 0 < ni ⱕ 1, i = 3 or 4. tS1 is the marginal reduction
in mortality risk from total learning in scenario 1, whereas tS2 is the marginal risk from
total learning in scenario 2. A decrease in qS1 in scenario 1 or an increase in qS2 in scenario
2 implies that the information learned from participation is more effective at reducing
mortality risk than the information learned from others’. This also means that a
decrease in qS1 or an increase in qS2 in their respective scenarios causes a reduction in the
beneficial effect of both type of learning on performance. In other words, when the
importance of vicarious learning increases relative to that of learning from participation,
mortality risk decreases and entrepreneurial performance improves as entry is delayed.

7. Using a model of the entry decision based on the uncertain evolution over time of environmental volatility and competition, Lévesque and Shepherd (2002) have characterized the performance-maximizing
time to enter an industry and have shown how this entry time is affected by changes in the business
scenario.

<-----Page 8----->The reverse is true, however, when the opportunity costs of adapting reduces the entrepreneur’s flexibility.

Entrepreneurial Performance
Our framework allows us to investigate the potential trade-off between two measures
of performance, namely profit potential and exposure to mortality risk, as the entrepreneur
considers when to enter an industry. Investigating the decision between paying dividends
and retaining earnings, Radner and Shepp (1996) suggest that firms should aim at maximizing a linear combination of profit and the probability of bankruptcy. Similarly, Schoemaker and Amit (1994) indicate that firms’ strategic actions constitute a trade-off between
profitability and risk. Such a trade-off can be captured when maximizing entrepreneurial
performance is equivalent to maximizing the potential return from the new venture
discounted to take into consideration the risk associated with the venture. Within this
context, and consistent with the standard economic idea of a negative relationship between
risk and returns, the entrepreneur’s objective is to enter the industry and to maximize her
expected total performance, which is a linear combination of profit potential and exposure
to mortality risk.
The entrepreneur’s objective function is thus given by
(1)

Max{ pt − ε rt } = Max {[ p0 − ρ t + f ( Pt , Vt )] − ε [γ e − ηt + g ( Pt , Vt )]} ,
t ≥0

t ≥0

where e is a conversion factor that transfers each risk unit into a dollar value (this
parameter can also be scaled to ensure that mortality risk stays between 0 and 1). Notice
that both types of learning contribute to performance (to profit potential via the function
f and to mortality risk via g) in an independent manner, that is, with no interaction effects.
This separability assumption has some empirical supports from studies in which the
relationship between vicarious learning and performance has been shown to be affected by
the presence or absence of learning from participation, but not by its level (Argote et al.,
1990; Baum & Ingram, 1998; Ingram & Baum, 1997). In addition, the mathematical
properties and tractability of this framework make it particularly useful and attractive.
Table 1 provides a summary of our notation.
Among others, Forlani and Mullins (2000) have shown that individuals exhibit different propensities toward risk. Along similar lines, Simon, Houghton, and Aquino (2000)
have suggested that perceived risk influences individuals’ willingness to start a business.
Accordingly, equation 1 can also be interpreted as an individual’s utility function in
which, consistent with existing literature (Iyigun & Owen, 1998; Kihlstrom & Laffont,
1979), we assume individuals to be risk averse. In fact, the weight associated with
(mortality) risk, e, shows a disutility and is a proxy for an individual’s propensity toward
risk. Without loss of generality, the weight associated with the return (potential profit) is
1. We will show that our results are robust even when the linearity assumption on the
utility function is relaxed.
Noticeably, our framework holds even if the entrepreneur’s objective is to maximize
profit potential or to minimize mortality risk, but not a combination of both. This is the
case because for each of these two measures of performance there is a trade-off between
the amounts of information that can be accumulated from the two types of learning as time
passes. Delaying entry means that more can be learned vicariously but less from participation. As these two types of learning affect each measure of performance in an opposite
way (in both scenarios), there is always a trade-off present (this also holds true when the

complete by integrating into the entrepreneur’s utility function a measure of return and a
measure of risk.8

Sensitivity of the Optimal Timing of Entry
Up to this point, our framework suggests that, when deciding when to enter the
industry, the entrepreneur wishes to select a time of entry that maximizes her expected
performance. The longer she waits the more she learns from others (which improves her
returns but may also increase her mortality risk) but the less she learns from direct
participation (which reduces her returns but may also reduce her mortality risk). Our
framework also suggests that how long she should wait to enter depends on the “hostility”
of the learning environment. That is, on how much the entrepreneur can learn to begin

8. Most literature on learning and entry (among others, Klepper, 1996; Klepper & Graddy, 1990; Nelson &
Winter, 1982) analyzes the impact of entry timing on expected profitability as a function of learning-by-doing
(R&D and scale) and vicarious learning (spillovers). However, this literature does not explicitly measure the
effects of both types of learning on (mortality) risk and the trade-off between risk and returns.

information directly and from others (as captured by the rates c and b), and on whether the
value to her performance of information provided by others increases relatively to that
provided by information she can gain by participating (as captured by qS1 or qS2 and n).9
Changes in any or all of these parameters influence her decision. Our framework allows
us to prove that, under pretty general circumstances, a unique optimal time of entry exists.
In other words, that an entry-timing decision that maximizes performance and is superior
to all others is possible.
Local, as opposed to global, optima would suffice for the results presented herein
to hold true (at least generically). Consequently, the optimality conditions we articulate
are tighter than needed. Moreover, specifying conditions for local optima would not add
qualitative insights. We therefore choose to keep the analysis simpler by focusing on
global optima. To establish how changes in key model parameters affect the timing of
entry, we conduct a comparative static analysis on such parameters and derive entry timing
propositions. All necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are provided by the
first and second order derivatives of the performance function in equation 1 with respect
to t and are presented in the Appendix. Sufficient conditions for uniqueness are also
derived.

Conditions for Optimality and Uniqueness
In scenario 1, the performance function is shaped as an inverted U (i.e., concave) and
a unique optimal entry time exists. The necessary condition for this optimal entry time
occurs when the marginal gain from delaying entry equals its marginal cost. The marginal
gain from delaying entry is generated by a decrease in mortality risk directly due to
industry maturity (age) and an increase in the information learned vicariously, whereas the
marginal cost arises from a decrease in profit potential caused by delaying entry and from
the forgone opportunity to learn from participation. We characterize sufficient conditions
for a unique optimal timing of entry also for scenario 2, but these conditions are tighter
than those for scenario 1. Specifically, (1) the same power functions for the contribution
of learning from participation and vicariously to profit and mortality risk must be utilized
for mathematical tractability (captured in C1 below); and (2) in relative terms, the benefit
from increased profit potential has a higher impact on performance than the loss associated with mortality risk (captured in C2 and C3 below).10 These conditions are derived in
the Appendix and expressed as

n1 = n3 and n2 = n4 ( C1) , ε <

Given our model, we are now able to derive entry propositions that hold for scenario
1, and for scenario 2 under conditions C1–C3. The results for scenario 1 and for scenario
2 (under conditions C1–C3) are identical. As mentioned earlier, when C1–C3 do not hold,
we can no longer guarantee that the optimal time of entry is unique.
9. The latter condition compares the effectiveness at increasing profit potential and decreasing mortality risk
from learning vicariously relative to learning from participation.
10. In other words, the conversion factor that transfers each risk unit into a dollar value must be relatively low
implying that entrepreneurs need to attach a relatively low opportunity cost to mortality risk. As a result, the
fact that learning increases mortality risk in scenario 2 does not change the results.

<-----Page 11----->Industry Participation and Timing of Entry
Proposition 111: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the rate
of decline in the amount of information learned from participation increases (i.e., c is
increased) while entry is delayed.
If the marginal amount of information learned from participation decreases at an
increasing rate while the entrepreneur delays entry, it means that the benefits to be gained
from participation accrue more quickly than those from vicarious learning; in other words,
that it is possible to create and retain competitive advantages from early entry. In those
cases, participation is beneficial if the entrepreneur enters in the early stages of the industry.
While some entry strategy studies have found learning from participation to be positively
related to performance (Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard, 1990), there has not been sufficient
recognition that the amount of information learned from participation varies across industries. These variations have a very important effect on the timing of entry decision. For
example, early entry in some industries may produce a lock-in effect or network externalities that later entrants may find hard or impossible to penetrate (Arthur, 1989). In other
cases, instead, most of the risks are faced in the early stages of the industry while later stages
still provide ample opportunity to learn from participation. Also, capturing the relationship
between a maturing industry and learning from participation has the potential to add further
insight into contingency theories of entry strategy and the environment.
Proposition 2: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the
amount of information from participation at t = 0 is lower (i.e., C is low).
This proposition refers to situations in which the entrepreneur needs to participate
longer in order to accumulate learning from participation. In other words, if the amount of
learning from participation to be realized by an entrepreneur at the beginning of the
industry’s life cycle is low, then that entrepreneur should enter early in order to build up
her information set compared with other entrepreneurs with higher initial learning abilities. It is important to recall that C (as many of the parameters in our model) is individual
specific and contributes to describing the entrepreneur’s learning abilities. As mentioned
in the introduction, the amount of information learned from participation and vicariously
varies not only across industries, but also among entrepreneurs depending on their relative
learning speed. Although some entry strategy studies have looked at the relationship
between learning from participation and performance (i.e., Burt, 1992; Feeser & Willard,
1990), to our knowledge there has been no sufficient recognition that the amount of
information learned from participation varies and that these variations are likely to
influence the timing of entry decision and, as a result, not only individuals’ performance
but also the competitive structure of industries.

Vicarious Learning and Timing of Entry
Proposition 3: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the rate
at which information learned vicariously (before entry) accumulates decreases (i.e., b
is decreased).
A decrease in the marginal accumulation of information learned vicariously means
that entrepreneurs will learn less quickly from the experience of others relative to
11. Proofs of all propositions are provided in the Appendix.

558

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->participation. This, in turn, encourages them to expedite entry. Heterogeneity in the rate of
learning vicariously might be captured by industry velocity. In high-velocity industries,
competitive advantage arises from rapidly creating and deploying new knowledge (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). A high-velocity industry may
indicate an environment where the opportunity to learn vicariously before entry is relatively low and therefore it is unlikely that an entrepreneur can benefit from delaying entry
to learn vicariously and use that information to improve performance.
We further note that the rate b at which information learned vicariously (before entry)
accumulates captures (in an aggregated manner) the fact that others can learn from the
entrepreneur. That is, competitive forces are implicit and aggregated in our framework. As
per proposition 3, if, ceteris paribus, others can learn from the entrepreneur faster (a
relative diminution in b), then entry should be expedited in order to take advantage of first
mover advantages (including higher profit potential).
Proposition 4: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the
amount of information learned vicariously at t = 0 is higher (i.e., B is high).
This proposition refers to situations in which the entrepreneur is able to acquire
vicarious learning rapidly. If the entrepreneur accumulates upfront a good amount of
information from the experience of others, she benefits from being an early participant in
the industry. That is, when the amount of vicarious learning to be realized by the
entrepreneur at the beginning of the industry life cycle is high, she should expedite entry
in order to take advantage of her learning ability. It is important to recall that B (as is many
of the parameters in our model) is individual specific and contributes to describing the
entrepreneur’s learning abilities. The discussion presented following proposition 2 applies
to proposition 4 as well.

Hostility of the Learning Environment and Timing of Entry
Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990) found that a firm’s ability to learn information
depends on characteristics of the environment, which include the complexity of the
information to be learned and the degree to which outside information is relevant to the
needs and concerns of each specific firm. We expand their conceptualization to entrepreneurial learning and argue that the novelty component of entrepreneurial decisions
elevates significantly the importance of the trade-off between learning directly or from
others. Entrepreneurs operate under uncertainty and, when making decisions, rely significantly on environmental clues (Aldrich, 1999). This is particularly true in volatile, newer,
or highly dynamic industries. Thus, useful insights about performance can be gained by
investigating the learning captured by an entrepreneur before entry and after entry relative
to the learning of later entrants. We argue that less “hostile” environments for entrepreneurial learning exist when (1) more information can be learned vicariously and from
participation (and hence these environments yield a higher increment in entrepreneurial
performance); and (2) when the information learned from the experiences of others is
relatively more effective at increasing performance than is the information learned from
participation.12

12. Our argument is consistent with Cohen and Levinthal (1989) who argue that learning-by-doing is more
effective in more hostile learning environments.

<-----Page 13----->Propositions 1–4 allow us to identify condition (1) above. The entrepreneur learns
more when the amount of learning from participation to be obtained at t = 0 is augmented
(i.e., C is increased), and/or its rate of decline (as entry is delayed) is diminished (i.e., c
is decreased), and/or when the rate of accumulation of vicarious learning increases while
she is waiting to enter (i.e., b is increased). These results from propositions 2, 1, and 3,
respectively, suggest that increased learning produces incentives toward delaying entry.
However, the entrepreneur also learns more when the amount of vicarious learning to be
obtained at t = 0 is augmented (i.e., B is increased). The latter result from proposition 4
suggests that increased learning produces incentives toward expediting entry. Thus, in
order to complete our analysis of timing of entry decisions (and identify condition (2)
above), it is necessary to determine the relative contribution to performance provided by
changes in learning from experience and by changes in learning from the experiences of
others.
To this purpose, we synthesize changes in the model’s parameters by assessing how
difficult it is to learn in the entrepreneur’s environment (i.e., satisfy (2) above). Specifically, we rely on n, the effectiveness of participation in increasing profit, as well as on qS1
and qS2, the effectiveness of participation in decreasing mortality risk for scenario 1 and
scenario 2, respectively.
Proposition 5: Ceteris paribus, the entrepreneur should expedite entry when the
effectiveness of learning from participation for both increasing profit and decreasing
mortality risk increases (i.e., n and qS1 are decreased for scenario 1, whereas n is
decreased but qS2 is increased for scenario 2).
We utilize propositions 1–5 to infer how the timing of industry entry in a more
“hostile” environment for learning compares to that of a less “hostile” one. Table 2
provides a summary of our prescriptions (and thus of propositions 1–5).
If the learning environment is more hostile via a small n and a small qS1, or via a small
n but a large qS2, then participation rather than vicarious learning provides relatively
greater profit potential and reduction in mortality risk (although in more hostile environments both learning vicariously and from participation are diminished via a decrease in b,
B, C and an increase in c). Expedited entry is then associated with an increased profit
potential and a decreased risk from information learned that more than outweighs the
direct costs of time on risk. However, if the learning environment is less hostile (both n
and qS1 are large, and both learning vicariously and from participation are augmented via
an increase in b, B, C and a decrease in c) then learning vicariously is relatively more
important than via participation. Delayed entry increases the amount of information
learned vicariously and therefore increases potential profit and decreases risk. This
increase in the profit potential and the reduction in risk (from both delaying entry and
increasing learning) outweighs the loss in profit potential resulting directly from delaying
entry. Therefore, based on the results of the proposition stated above (and as illustrated in
Table 2, second and third column) entry should be expedited in more hostile learning
environments and delayed in less hostile learning environments.13
When conditions C2 and C3 for scenario 2 are violated, the conversion factor (e) that
transfers each risk unit into a dollar value is relatively large, and the entrepreneur
13. Noticeably, in our model, heterogeneous individuals (as well as different industries) can be easily
characterized by altering the magnitude of the parameters. For example, everything else being the same, an
individual who learns quickly from participation (e.g., C is large and/or c is small) but slowly vicariously (e.g.,
B and/or b is small) should delay entry in either scenario 1 or 2 (respectively, second and third columns in
Table 2) compared with an individual able to accumulate information equally from both types of learning.

there exists a unique optimal entry timing, expediting entry in a hostile environment may
no longer be the dominating strategy. Indeed, changes in the parameters as described in
Table 2 (fourth column) then suggest an expedited industry entry for only half of these
parameters. Changes as described in Table 2 for the other half of the parameters suggest,
instead, a delayed industry entry.
Although the timing of entry is sensitive to changes in the profit potential p0 of the
pioneering entrepreneur, the effect g of industry age on mortality risk, and the exponential
rate h at which that risk decreases, our qualitative results are not and, in fact, the
assumption that potential profit declines at a fixed rate and the assumption that mortality
risk declines at an exponential rate can both be relaxed. Also, the direct marginal loss of
profit potential r due to delayed entry can be used to capture the per-period cost of
learning vicariously. If this cost increases with the hostility of the learning environment,
which makes good intuitive sense, then our results are robust and entry should be
expedited in more hostile environments for learning. Learning from participation,
however, does not have a cost in our baseline framework. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to verify that, if each period of participation involves a cost, our results hold if that
cost increases with the hostility of the learning environment but does not exceed the
per-period cost r of learning vicariously (which makes intuitive sense since otherwise it
would not pay for the entrepreneur to be in the industry).
Finally, as formally shown in the Appendix, our results are robust even when performance is represented by a multiplicative function of profit and risk and equation 1
becomes Max { pt [1 − rt ]}, which functional form also captures the trade-off between risk
t ≥0
and return highlighted by Schoemaker and Amit (1994).14 This functional form is appealing because it is based on the computation of an expectation where potential profit is zero
if the venture does not survive. In scenario 1, whereby increases in learning correspond to
higher profit potential and lower mortality risk, reasonable conditions are sufficient for all
of our propositions to hold true. These conditions are: (1) profit potential p0 of the
pioneering entrepreneur (not attributed to learning) is sufficiently large (which also keeps
profit potential nonnegative and entry attractive); and (2) at the optimal entry time, the
∂r ∂t
ratio of change in mortality risk to survival risk (i.e., t
) is below a threshold. We
1 − rt t = t *
then still recommend that entry be expedited in more hostile environments for learning, as
summarized in Table 2 (fifth column). However, in scenario 2, where increases in learning
correspond to higher profit potential but also higher mortality risk, we find that all but one
of our sensitivity results are violated under conditions (1) and (2). As a result, changes in
the parameters as described in Table 2 (sixth column) suggest an expedited entry for only
two out of six of these parameters.

Conclusion
Learning scholars, such as Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990), have made a significant
contribution to our knowledge of the relationship between learning and the environment,
14. We demonstrate in the Appendix that concavity is preserved is scenario 1, but in scenario 2 it requires that
the effect of industry age on mortality risk (g) be sufficiently large or, equivalently, that the marginal reduction
in mortality risk from total learning (tS2) be sufficiently small.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->i.e., that some environments enhance a firm’s ability to learn while others diminish it.
Given the novelty involved in entrepreneurial activity, we argue that learning from participation and learning from the experiences of others are particularly important factors in
such entry decisions, especially in certain types of industries. The longer the entrepreneur
waits the more she learns from others but by doing so she reduces her ability to learn
directly and, therefore, to appropriate a comparative (possibly first mover) advantage.
Thus, to help her decision, the entrepreneur considers whether she can improve her
performance more by learning what others are doing and delaying entry or if, instead, she
is better off by entering. We show that how long the entrepreneur should wait to enter the
industry depends on the hostility of the environment. That is, on how much there is to
learn to begin with (captured by propositions 2 and 4), on the speed at which she can learn
new information directly and from others (captured by propositions 1 and 3), and on
whether the information created by others is relatively more valuable for her performance
than the information she can gain by entering (captured by proposition 5).
Overall, our results prove that delaying entry is more sensible the less hostile is the
environment. Yet, the entrepreneur cannot wait forever. Our model shows that, under some
pretty general conditions, it is possible to identify a unique optimal time of entry, and
allows us to discuss specific situations in which multiple equilibria arise and a unique
optimal time cannot be determined.15 Our learning approach to the investigation of entry
timing presents a number of relevant features. First, both sources of learning, and their
trade-offs, are taken into consideration in making the timing of entry decision. Second, the
role of the environment on the optimal time to enter an industry is investigated in terms of
its impact on learning from participation and/or vicariously. Third, entry performance is
determined by a combination of profitability and risk.
This study contributes to our understanding of how entrepreneurs learn and of the fact
that learning varies from individual to individual and from industry to industry, which in
turn suggests a strong tendency for earlier industry entry when one faces a more hostile
environment for learning. It also contributes to the industrial economics literature (Cohen
& Levinthal, 1989, 1990) by extending the concept of the hostility of an environment for
learning. To complement this literature, we use a decision-theoretic approach to characterize the optimal timing of entry for an entrepreneur, and to assess how this entry time
is influenced by changes in key model parameters, including those that characterize
the hostility of the learning environment. We extend this concept of the hostility of an
environment for learning to include the marginal accumulation of information learned
from participation, the information learned from participation at the time of entry for the
pioneering entrepreneur, the marginal accumulation of information learned vicariously,
the information learned vicariously at the time of entry for the pioneering entrepreneur,
and the effect on profit potential and risk of vicarious learning relative to learning from
participation.
From a practical point of view, our model points out that one’s level of industry
expertise is significant when evaluating the hostility of the learning environment. For
example, given a specific industry, let us compare an entrepreneur with many years of
work experience in the industry—referred to as the “expert”—to one with a few years
of work experience in that same industry—referred to as the “novice.” Let us assume
that both entrepreneurs have gone through similar education and, as a result, there is no
15. The actual specification of how long to wait and when to enter is beyond the scope of this paper and it
requires the calculation of numerical values for all model parameters. Most of these parameters are specific
to the entrepreneur while two of them (g and h) are specific to her industry since they characterize the direct
effect from delaying market entry on mortality risk (which declines with industry maturity).

<-----Page 17----->obvious reason to believe that they would exhibit differences in the speed at which they
can learn new information directly and from others. The novice would likely face a more
hostile environment than the expert because, relative to the expert, the novice would have
more to learn to begin with and the information created by others would be relatively less
valuable for her performance. Thus, our model would suggest that the novice entrepreneur
should be an early entrant as the gains from learning from participating in the industry
would overcome the gains from learning from others.
Our investigation of entrepreneurial learning before entry provides a relatively simple
model of the timing of entry decision. Although frameworks dealing with this type of issue
are very difficult to operationalize, empirical testing could be addressed with the development of an economic experiment. Indeed, our decision-theoretic framework could be
used to develop an experiment testing how long the entrepreneur would wait before
entering. The experiment output could then be compared with what entrepreneurs actually
do. By providing multiple decision scenarios, this experiment could also be used to test
the behavior of decision makers with respect to the qualitative prescriptions in propositions 1–5. Of course, testing propositions from analytical models with real world data is
often a challenge. Nevertheless, our model lends itself well to be tested empirically. For
example, when considering proposition 2, data should be obtained that would allow proxy
measures of (1) the date at which the industry started; (2) the date at which the entrepreneur entered the chosen industry; and (3) the amount of learning from participation to be
realized by an entrepreneur at the beginning of the industry’s life cycle. Market size and
first sales could be used for (1) and (2), respectively. Consistent with existing literature on
learning, the more complex learning potential of the entrepreneur, instead, could be
approximated as a weighted average of the entrepreneur’s experience in the chosen
industry and her education as well as that industry’s requirement for specialized expertise.
Far from closing the debate on this area of research, our study and model lend
themselves to several other research extensions. For example, it should be pointed out that
it is not clear how purposeful entrepreneurs might be about assessing their learning. Our
model is perfectly compatible with this issue as it relies entirely on relative comparisons:
The type of information necessary includes only whether or not entrepreneur X learns new
information faster than entrepreneur Y; whether or not entrepreneur X learns faster from
others than entrepreneur Y; whether or not entrepreneur X has to learn more (because e.g.,
she is a novice in the industry) than entrepreneur Y; and whether or not relative performance associated with the information created by others as compared with that gained by
participating in the industry is (relatively) less valuable to entrepreneur X than to entrepreneur Y. Entrepreneurs, like all human beings, compare themselves to peers (and
perhaps even to role models) and make assessments about their position with respect to
others. Whether these comparisons are indeed implicit or explicit could be the subject of
an interesting test for our model to be developed in a follow-up paper.
Finally, our framework of entrepreneurial learning and entry timing could be extended
to allow for the explicit consideration of competitive forces and the resulting effect on
industry structure. In this case, a simulation balancing real-world complexity with mathematical tractability could be used. A simulation model could be also used to study
industry evolution. This would require modeling rivalry and reaction times, assuming
some randomness, and alternative degrees of rationality and information (Nelson &
Winter, 1982). Unlike our current framework, which focuses on individual decisions, such
a model would be useful in studying industry structure and how the timing of entry of
various participants influences the industry’s convergence toward any particular type
of equilibrium. Indeed, an appropriately modified version of our model could be used
to study issues related to organization rather than individual learning along lines identified
564

<-----Page 18----->by Huber (1991) and Levitt and March (1988). Finally, the model can be used to analyze
the possibility of competency traps in organizations. In other words, our model could be
extended to study issues related to strategic entry timing in highly dynamic industries or
unstable industry situations. This has clear policy implications since it could be applied to
post-war and post-disaster economies, as well as high-tech industries.
