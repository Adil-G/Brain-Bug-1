Abstract
Previous research on university start-ups has examined conditions that
favor the formation of such start-ups, yet less attention has been paid to
the commercial outcomes of technologies developed by these firms. In this
paper we ask whether start-ups are more or less successful than established
firms in bringing inventions to market. We find the time to commercialization for inventions licensed by start-up firms to be comparable to that of
established firms when controlling for technology area. Inventions licensed
by start-ups produce higher royalties for the university on average, however. We also find that successful commercialization of new technologies by
start-ups in our sample almost always follows acquisition by an established
firm. This finding suggests a "division of labor" between start-ups and
established firms, where start-ups develop certain types of technologies and
established firms provide complementary assets.

Academics characterize entrepreneurs as a peculiar group of individuals. Economic models have focused on risk tolerance as a critical characteristic of entrepreneurs (Kihlstrom and Laﬀont 1979). Others have argued that observed
risk tolerance merely represents a cognitive bias in which entrepreneurs tend to
overvalue opportunities they are faced with (Kahneman and Lovallo 1993). As
Kahneman and Lovallo (1993) argue, individuals may be subject to "Bold Forecasts," when entrepreneurs apply an "inside view" by focusing narrowly on the
unique details of a specific asset or project rather than evaluating the potential
of the project given its observable characteristics and the success rates of other
projects with similar characteristics (Kahneman and Lovallo 1993). As evidence,
Cooper, Woo and Dunkelberg (1988) found that entrepreneurs’ assessments of
their potential were uncorrelated with typical independent, or outside, predictors
of success.
To the extent that biased perceptions of success is more pronounced among
start-up founders than managers of established firms, start-up firms should have
a lower average likelihood of success than established firms. This theory suggests
a simple empirical question: do entrepreneurial ventures suﬀer from "Bold Forecasts"? In this paper, we examine whether a specific segment of entrepreneurs,
university researchers who found firms to develop their inventions, overvalue their
opportunities to start a firm. We study success rates of inventor-founded start-ups
relative to other firms in commercializing inventions discovered at the University
of California (UC) over a 20 year period, 1980-1999.
Entrepreneurial success can be measured in several ways, and we find surprisingly mixed results. Entrepreneurs and established firms illustrate the same
rate of success in development and commercialization (measured by first sale of a
product). However, entrepreneurs tend to hold on to development projects years
after established firms discontinue development. We also find that conditional on
achieving first sale, start-ups generate greater returns to the university, although
the vast majority of successful start-ups were acquired by an established firm
before the first sale occurred. This finding suggests that the university start-up
may serve as an intermediate organizational form for technological development.
Commercialization may critically depend on linkages with established firms that
own critical specialized or co-specialized complementary assets (Teece 1986).
Lastly, we oﬀer one methodological finding for the literature on university
technology transfer. Previous empirical examinations of university start-up firm’s
2

<-----Page 2----->success were limited to patented inventions rather than all licensed inventions.
The latter population includes licensed inventions that did not have patents issued during the license. We find that limiting analysis to patented inventions
introduces a bias favoring established firms in comparing their success rates of
commercialization to that of start-up firms.
University start-ups provide an attractive sample to examine this research
question for a number of reasons. First, university inventors arguably represent
the epitome of an economic agent that fits Kahneman and Lovallo’s notion of
individuals susceptible to Bold Forecasts. University faculty have a narrow, deep
knowledge of their research projects, but often lack industrial experience or knowledge to compare the commercial potential of similar projects in the marketplace.
Other university licensees, such as established firms and start-ups founded by an
outside party—rather than the inventor— begin with greater market knowledge and
utilize an "outside view" in the language of Kahneman and Lovallo (1993). This
set up provides an opportunity to compare whether the Inside View bias, or Bold
Forecasts, are a significant factor in university licensing.
Second, university start-ups have attracted considerable attention for their
technology management and public policy implications. While established firms
account for a majority of licensees, start-up firms have emerged as a viable and
important vehicle for bringing university technologies to market and have been
successful. In the biotechnology industry for example, Chiron and Genentech are
two notable firms founded to commercialize inventions originating in the university
research lab. Google, Akamai Technologies, Lycos, and Inktomi are just a few of
the internet pioneers whose technical roots began at a university.
University start-ups carry an important public policy perspective, particularly
since universities often devote their own resources, many of which are publicly
funded, to encourage start-up activity. Universities have increasingly been willing to take equity positions in lieu of royalty payments for intellectual property
licenses. In a 2000 survey, Feldman, et. al. found that 40% of research universities surveyed held equity investments in new firms licensing their technology
(Feldman, Feller, Bercovitz and Burton 2002). These equity positions have sometimes been profitable. For example, the University of California received $1.9
million from its equity in software firm Inktomi (UC Technology Transfer Annual
Report 2000 2001) and Carnegie Mellon University held considerable equity in and
a board seat at search engine company Lycos, both which issued IPO’s during the
boom of the late-1990’s.
In the next section we briefly review existing studies of university technology
3

<-----Page 3----->licensing by start-up firms. Section 3 describes the data and our methodology,
and Section 4 discusses the results of the our empirical analysis. We discuss the
implications of our findings and conclude the paper in Section 5.

2. Recent Literature on University Start-ups
The entrepreneurial firm has long played a significant role in the commercialization
of university inventions, often pursuing product development after existing firms
failed to introduce a product. For example, in 1945 MIT licensed the rights to
its Van deGraﬀ patent to High Voltage, Inc., a start-up originated specifically to
develop commercial applications for the MIT technology. High Voltage obtained
its license only after General Electric Company had earlier licensed this patent
and subsequently failed to commercialize this technology (Etzkowitz 2002). More
recently, Calimetrics, a start-up founded by a University of California inventor,
was formed to commercialize an optical storage technology originally licensed by a
company supplying laboratory equipment to the UC inventors (Lowe 2001). These
examples suggest that start-up firms are a viable option for commercialization,
despite these firms’ limited access to financial capital and complementary assets,
factors critical to successful development and introduction of a new technology
(Teece 1986).
A number of recent studies have examined the incidence of university of technology licensing to entrepreneurial firms. Analyzing licensing activity at MIT,
Shane has examined several factors that encourage new firm formation, including opportunity recognition by entrepreneurs (Shane 2000a), the eﬀectiveness of
patents and complementary assets (Shane 2000b), and the existence of technological opportunities (Shane 2001). DiGregorio and Shane found that not all
universities seem equally capable in identifying new firms as potential licensees
(DiGregorio and Shane 2003). They also found that campuses with strong research reputations and universities with favorable policies towards inventor reimbursement and equity investment encouraged greater new firm formation. Lowe
found that inventors may form new firms to commercialize new technologies due
to diﬃculties in contracting in the presence of tacit knowledge (Lowe 2003).
Other studies have examined the performance of university-based start-ups.
Shane and Stuart found start-up firms’ ability to attract venture capital, achieve
an initial public oﬀering (IPO), and even survive depends heavily on founders’ network of pre-existing ties to financiers, such as angel investors or venture capitalists
(Shane and Stuart 2002). In a paper more closely related to our study, Shane
4

<-----Page 4----->compared conditions under which MIT inventions were licensed to both startups and established firms and assessed the subsequent outcomes of these licenses
(Shane 2002). The eﬀectiveness of patent protection in the technological field
of the licensed invention influenced whether a start-up or established firm would
be the licensee. Shane (2002) proposes that among inventions for which patents
served as an eﬀective mechanism for appropriating economic returns, transaction problems such as adverse selection, moral hazard, and hold-up were reduced,
facilitating the licensing of inventions to established firms. When patents were ineﬀective in mitigating these "failures" in markets for technology, contracting with
an established firm was more diﬃcult. In these instances, licensing to an inventor
founded start-up was more likely because the inventor had intimate knowledge of
the licensed technology and was not subject to these transaction and information
problems.
Shane (2002) argues that licensing to an inventor-founded start-up is a "secondbest" solution since such firms were more likely to lack assets necessary to successfully bring a product to market, such as market knowledge, contacts with customers, or manufacturing capabilities. We would therefore expect that inventions
licensed to start-ups to perform more poorly than those licensed to established
firms with respect to commercialization. Indeed, Shane found that in those technology fields where patent eﬀectiveness was weak, inventor-founded licensees were
more likely to terminate a license and less likely to introduce a new product based
on the licensed technology than an established licensee.

3. Data and Methodology
3.1. Sample construction
The university licensing process provides a detailed paper trail related to each invention provides a rare detailed view of the history of an invention from disclosure
through development. However, the detailed paper trail comes with some cost;
the complexity of diﬀerent licensing types, patenting practices, revenues received,
and other factors requires careful construction and coding of the data to ensure
data integrity and minimize potential bias. In this section, we devote considerable space to describing the data construction in detail, in large part because our
results appear to conflict with previous research in this area which may to some
degree reflect diﬀerences in how the data is constructed.
We analyze 734 inventions at the University of California disclosed to and
5

<-----Page 5----->exclusively licensed by the university. We define a start-up as a firm founded
specifically to license and commercialize a technology within our sample. We contacted licensees directly and utilized secondary sources to verify whether or not
each firm in our sample was a start-up as part of a broader project at UC.
Our unit of analysis is an invention and is based on a disclosure by a faculty member to the university.1 Faculty are obligated to disclose inventions for
which they believe there is commercial value based a combination of federal legislation and their employment contract with the University of California. Thirty-six
percent of the inventions in our sample were licensed by start-up firms with established firms licensing the remainder. Start-up licensees can be placed in two
categories of interest. Some start-ups were founded or co-founded by the university inventor, while other start-ups did not include the involvement of the inventor. Among only those inventions licensed to all start-ups, 72% were licensed by
inventor-founded firms (or 27% of the overall sample of licensed inventions).
Many studies of university technology transfer (including some of our own
work) consider only patented inventions. Patent data are attractive in studies
of innovation partly because they are readily available and can be easily used
to construct variables based on technology class, citations counts, and the like.
Sampling only on patented inventions introduces several potential biases, however. First, technology areas or industries in which patents are perceived as less
important for successful technology transfer, product development, or commercialization may be underrepresented. Second, considering the patent as the unit
of analysis introduces possible "double-counting" because many inventions are
associated with more than one U.S. patent (biomedical inventions in particular).
Finally, sampling only on patented inventions overstates the rate of successful
commercialization since a license may be terminated prior to patent issue, which
we assume represents a failure to commercialize. This sampling process, as we
will show later in the paper, overstates the rate of success of established firms
in commercialization eﬀorts since, compared to start-ups in our data, established
firms are significantly more likely to cancel unsuccessful commercialization eﬀorts
earlier in the process (in many cases before the patent has issued). In order to mitigate these potential biases, we include both patented and unpatented inventions
in our analysis2 .
1

More precisely, the unit of analysis is a license-invention pair since in a few cases inventions
are licensed at diﬀerent times by diﬀerent firms. For example, Firm B may license invention i
after Firm A terminated a prior license of the same invention.
2
Virtually all inventions in our sample are associated with a patent application, however.

6

<-----Page 6----->Our primary interest in this paper is to compare whether start-ups are more or
less "successful" than established firms at commercializing university inventions.
A license to an invention in this regard represents an eﬀort by a company to
develop and ultimately commercialize the invention. For our examination, we
then categorize the outcome of a license for an invention as an event, in the sense
of an event-history or duration model. Each outcome event is then categorized
into one of three mutually exclusive "States":
1. "Commercialized" (licensed with commercial sales, n=188; 25.6%)
2. "Terminated" (licensed but contract was subsequently cancelled or ended
prior to sales, n=290; 39.5%)
3. "Censored" (licensed but no commercial sales nor license termination, n=256;
34.9%)
Table 1 reports the distribution of inventions by whether the licensee is an
established firm or a start-up, and the latter is divided into those firms founded
by an inventor and those start-ups for which the inventor had no involvement
("other start-ups"). We identify inventions within State 1 as those for which the
firm has paid royalties to the university based on product sales. State 2 includes
inventions for which the license was cancelled, thus signalling that the licensee has
discontinued development and commercialization of the technology.3 We treat
State 3 observations as censored. Inventions in this state include active (nonterminated) licenses that have not reported commercial sales. Therefore, neither
a commercialization nor license termination event had occurred by the last time
period in our analysis for these inventions.
In some of the regression models, we use payments to the university, such as
fees and royalties, as proxies for economic return on or invention value. A challenging aspect to coding university royalty data is how to treat minimum royalty
payments that do not necessarily reflect product sales. Most contracts specify that
Since the patenting process is costly, the university often shops the invention to prospective
licensees to gauge commercial interest prior to incurring patent application fees and expenses.
While the University of California and many other universities incur patent application costs
initially, some if not all costs are typically reimbursed by the licensee. Firms usually do not
license inventions when a patent either does not exist, nor when there are no future plans to
apply for a patent. In our sample, a patent was either applied for, or in a few cases, approved
to be filed but the application had not yet been submitted.
3
An alternative possibility for state 2 inventions is discussed in the next section.

7

<-----Page 7----->the licensee pay the minimum of either a fixed dollar amount (minimum royalty)
or a percentage of total sales (earned royalty). If sales are below a particular level,
the licensee pays the minimum amount. In some cases, the total dollar sales to
date are zero, and the licensee paid the minimum royalty in anticipation that the
product would still be commercialized (since the firm did not cancel or renegotiate
the license terms we assume that it anticipates forthcoming sales). The challenge
therefore is to correctly categorize licensed inventions that received minimum royalties. We cannot observe whether a minimum royalty payment represents the
case of sales under the minimum amount (but commercialization has occurred) or
simply no sales and hence the invention has yet to be commercialized.
This data challenge applies to a minority of inventions, but is non-trivial.
Overall, 17.5% of the inventions generated a minimum royalty but no additional
earned royalty. We seek to be conservative in our approach while still trying
to best utilize the information we have on the current State of each invention.
Licensed inventions for which a minimum royalty was paid but the license was
subsequently terminated are coded as terminated on the date of termination. Inventions generating a minimum royalty and a subsequent earned royalty are coded
as commercialized on the earliest date of minimum royalty. Finally, inventions
generating only minimum royalties, but not terminated, are coded as commercialized on the date of minimum royalty.
A second consideration is that data integrity relies on the timeliness and accuracy of licensees reporting sales to the university for the purpose of determining
royalty payments. Unfortunately, we are not able to observe instances where
the licensee terminates an agreement (and therefore discontinues payments to the
university) but continues development and commercialization activity.4 University licensing is a repeated game to the extent that multiple relationships between
inventors, the university, and outside companies that should mitigate such behavior. Continued commercialization after license termination would invite both
legal action if discovered and preclude future licensing with the university. Hence,
while there is a punishment mechanism, monitoring is presumably costly and
this relationship oﬀers no guarantee against firms appropriating technologies from
universities.
4

Shane (2002) also suggests this possibility. He points out that established firms may
license an invention to learn about the technology or obtain related knowledge, but subsequently
terminate the license without intent to commercialize. We agree that such cases may exist. Our
concern with this bias is limited to the eﬀect that active commercial eﬀorts have towards license
termination.

8

<-----Page 8----->Inventor founded start-ups (a large portion of our start-up population) may
be more likely to be forthcoming in reporting product sales since the inventor has
an economic incentive to monitor the licensee (i.e., her company) as the inventor
receives a share of the royalties. In addition, start-ups may delay reporting product
sales to preserve cash that would otherwise go towards royalty payments, believing
they are less likely to be sued for contract violation by the university if the inventor
is also a university employee.
3.2. Measures of "Success"
We measure start-up licensee success in several ways. First, we examine the probability of particular events that indicate success, such as first product sales or
termination of the project by the licensee. We first construct the unconditional
(non-parametric) survival functions of licensed inventions for start-up firms and
established firms for two types of outcomes, (a) first product sale which we characterize as successful commercialization, and (b) termination of a license before
commercial sales which we characterize as a failed eﬀort. We then compare these
functions by firm type. Extending this analysis, we then turn to parametric survival analysis, allowing us to control for a number of factors not included in a
graphical examination of survivor functions.
A third analysis examines the overall returns to the university based on the
university’s economic return related to inventions. Because we are not able to
observe commercial sales for each product since many of the firms in the sample are private companies and do not report product-line sales, following Sampat
and Ziedonis we use royalty income to the university as a proxy for overall sales
(Sampat and Ziedonis 2003). This analysis provides insight into the level of commercial success of inventions licensed by start-ups and generates an estimate of
the economic value of licensed inventions within the sample.
Lastly, we focus on only those inventions licensed by start-up firms to examine the relationship between ownership status (whether the start-up continues to
operate independently or was acquired by an established firm) and commercialization status (whether commercial sales had occurred). This analysis provides
additional insight into the development and commercialization processes of university inventions by start-ups.

9

<-----Page 9----->4. Analysis and Discussion
4.1. Non-parametric survival analysis
We begin analysis with an examination the hazards of commercialized and terminated inventions using Kaplan and Meier’s (1958) non-parametric product limit
estimation. The Kaplan-Meier method provides a descriptive view of the overall
survival functions, and allows us to unconditionally compare start-up and established firm licensees over time. The value of reviewing unconditional survival is
primarily as a summary statistic of sorts— to better understand the data at a high
level before applying more fine-grained analysis.
We calculate the probability of occurrence of an event (e.g., commercialization) on a given day based on the number of events occurring, E, and the number
of observations at-risk, R, at time tl . An observation is removed from the at-risk
pool if the observation is censored or removed due to the occurrence of another
event (e.g., termination). Spells begin on the date of patent filing for the first
patent related to an invention, and we track first sale events or termination events
through December 2002. For all survival analyses each spell begins on the patent
application date and ends on the date a royalty payment was received (commercialized), the license was terminated, or the end of the sample period was reached
(censored).
The University of California historically followed a practice of initiating a
patent filing only after apparent, if not committed, commercial interest by potential licensees. This date most closely reflects the commencement of the commercialization process, therefore. As we note above, not every invention is associated
with an issued patent since a license may be terminated prior to the issuance of
a patent. Each licensed invention is associated with a patent application (or
an approval to file a patent) however, since firms are unwilling to pay licensing
fees without the assurance of exclusive rights to develop and market the licensed
invention.
The Kaplan-Meier procedure generates a step-function estimate of daily survival and is particularly useful for these data since over one-third of the observab
tions are censored. This estimator, H(t),
is expressed as:5
5

For constructing confidence intervals in the analysis, standard errors of the survival function are calculated by applying Greenwood’s suggested method (Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995):

The maximum survival time in the data is 7585 days (almost 21 years). Inventions experiencing a non-censoring event that removes them from the risk pool
R are coded as censored at the maximum spell in the data. For example, in the
estimation of the hazard of commercialization, inventions that were terminated
are coded as censored at 7585 days. The intuition behind this coding scheme
is as follows: our analysis estimates the probability that an invention i will be
successfully commercialized by firm j in time t (and vice versa for the hazard of
termination analysis). A termination is an event that signifies invention i will
never be commercialized by firm j during any period. By keeping these terminated observations in the risk set throughout the process, we more precisely
estimate the probability of commercialization. The alternative scheme, coding
terminated licenses as censored on the date of termination, would understate the
pool of inventions that could have otherwise been commercialized, thus biasing
the estimation upwards6 .
Following Dechenaux, et al. (2002), we count inventions for which royalties
were paid but the invention was subsequently terminated as commercialized inventions since in this analysis we are primarily interested in whether an invention
is initially commercialized.
Figure 1 plots the estimated commercial sale survival functions for start-ups
and established firms. The survival rate for commercialization for start-up firms
is below the corresponding rate for established firms throughout the time series,
indicating that start-up firms are more likely to achieve a first sale on a licensed
invention than are more established licensees. We report the results of a test
that the two hazard functions are equal at time t where each observation is given
equal weight (Tarone and Ware 1977). We can reject that the survival functions
for commercialization of technologies for start-ups and established firm licensees
are identical (P > χ2 = 0.013).7
6

One last technical consideration is the treatment of, in the hazard of termination models,
inventions for which a minimum royalty was paid, but no other information on first sale or
license termination exists. As discussed earlier, we code these inventions as commercialized
on the date of minimum royalty payment in the hazard of commercialization analysis. In the
hazard of termination models however, we consider observations with only minimum royalties
reported as censored on the last date of the sample frame, December 31, 2002, rather than at
7585 days since we have no information for these observations beyond that date.
7
We found similar results when employing diﬀerent weighting of events over time using the

11

<-----Page 11----->Figure 2 plots the corresponding survival rates for termination of the license.
The survival rate for start-up firms exceed the rate for established firms throughout the period, indicating that start-up firms are less likely to terminate a license
than are established licensees. The Tarone-Ware test statistic indicates that these
survival functions are significantly diﬀerent (P > χ2 = 0.018).
Overall, the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation indicates that for our sample, at any given time t, start-ups are more likely to achieve a first sale for a licensed
invention than are established firms, while being less likely to abandon commercialization eﬀorts and terminate the license. Although we have not controlled for
factors that may influence these survival functions, these estimates suggest that,
contrary to some earlier hypotheses, start-up firms may be at least as eﬀective in
commercializing technologies arising from university research as established firms.
We explore this possibility further in the next section.
4.2. Parametric survival analysis
The Kaplan-Meier estimation, while informative, does not enable us to examine
some of the factors that may account for the diﬀerences in commercialization
outcomes between start-ups and established firms. In this section, we undertake
a parametric analysis that controls for time, campus, and technology eﬀects that
may underpin the above findings.
We specify a survival estimation with a Gompertz distribution. The estimation
is based on the following hazard function for time t (Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995):
H(ti ) = exi β+γti . γ is an estimate of the overall hazard function over time based
on the data. In each of our regressions γ is positive, indicating that hazard rates
are monotonically increasing with time.
We condition the analysis on three classes of control variables. First, we include a dummy variable for each inventor’s campus to capture any campus-specific
or geographic eﬀects.8 We recognize inventions made by multiple inventors at
diﬀerent campuses. We also include dummies for the year of invention disclosure
to capture time-varying eﬀects.
Lastly, we control for technology field. We depart from the previous literature
on university start-ups since we are examining a broader class of inventions than
only those for which a patent was issued. Previous studies of university start-ups
log-rank and Wilcoxon statistics (not reported).
8
Because no start-up firms licensed technologies from UC Santa Cruz, we omit this campus
from our analysis.

12

<-----Page 12----->utilized either international patent classes (Lowe 2003) or broad technology areas
aggregating U.S. patent classifications into five technology classes (Shane 2002) to
control for technology field. In this paper we identify the academic departments
of primary appointment for each inventor to control for technology field eﬀects.
A dummy variable = 1 signifies each inventor’s academic department aﬃliation
(e.g., mechanical engineering, physics, or oncology).9
Table 2 reports the results of Gompertz regressions for the competing risks of
commercialization and termination of inventions licensed by start-ups and established firms. Models 1a and 1b include only a dummy variable for start-ups as
a covariate. The hazard rate for commercialization is greater than one (1.400)
at a five percent level of significance Consistent with our earlier Kaplan-Meier
analysis, this coeﬃcient indicates that start-up firms are more likely to achieve
a first-sale from a licensed technology than are established firms. Similarly, the
hazard rate for termination is 0.697 (and significantly less than one), indicating
that start-up firms are less likely to terminate a license than are established firms.
Models 2a and 2b control for the academic department of the inventor and
the location of the inventing campus. For clarity, we do not report coeﬃcients
for the department covariates. When we control for campus and department,
the diﬀerence in hazard rates for commercialization by start-ups and established
firms becomes non-significant (0.940), although the hazard rate for termination
by start-ups remains below that of established firms (significant to the 1% level).
These results are qualitatively similar when we introduce year dummy variables
in models 3a and 3b.10
Even when we control for campus and time eﬀects, start-up firms are less
likely to terminate a license than are established firms. This may reflect entrepreneurial persistence (Cooper, Woo and Dunkelberg 1988), that new firms are
more likely to be single-product firms, or the need by start-ups to demonstrate to
9

Comparable departments at diﬀerent campuses may have similar but not identical names,
such as "Electrical and Computer Engineering" and "Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences." We characterized such departments as equivalent across campuses.
10
Interestingly, coeﬃcients for the dummies for the Los Angeles (UCLA), San Diego (UCSD),
and San Francisco (UCSF) campuses in models 2 and 3 are significantly below one, indicating
that inventions licensed from those locations are more likely to be achieve an initial sale than
inventions licensed from the other UC campuses. This may reflect the composition of the
pool of inventions available from licensing at these three campuses - all three include major
medical research facilities, and we suspect that a high proportion of inventions generated at these
campuses are biomedical in nature. Of the top five income earning inventions licensed from
the University of California, Stanford, and Columbia universities, most have been biomedical
inventions (Mowery, Nelson, Sampat and Ziedonis 2001).

13

<-----Page 13----->outside financiers such as venture capitalists that the start-up is actively pursuing commercialization. In any event, the commercialization results suggest that
established firms enjoy little advantage compared to start-ups in achieving a first
sale with university technology.
So far, we have not diﬀerentiated among start-ups founded by inventors for the
purpose of commercializing their own inventions and other start-up firms. The
formation of start-up firms by inventors has been found to be correlated with diﬃculties in contracting with established organizations in the presence of information
problems (Shane 2002) and specifically tacit knowledge (Lowe 2003). Because
inventor-founded firms would not encounter these diﬃculties, both Shane (2002a)
and Lowe (2003a) argue that such firms are more likely to be the licensee in the
presence of such failures in the market for technology. Non-inventor start-up
firms, therefore, should be similar to more established firms in this regard. Potential adverse selection, moral hazard, hold-up, and diﬃculties in the transfer
of tacit knowledge should aﬄict any firm in which the inventor does not have a
founding or otherwise intimate role. To examine commercial outcomes associated
with only those start-ups founded by inventors, we conducted regressions comparing these firms with all other firms. Results for this analysis is reported in Table
3.
Models 4a and 4b in Table 3 estimate the hazard rates for commercialization
and termination for inventor-founded start-ups and all other firms, respectively,
again reporting log odds ratios. Inventor-founded start-ups are slightly more likely
to achieve a first sale (significant at the 10% level) than are established firms.
Moreover, they are significantly less likely to terminate a license than an existing
firm (0.674, significant at the 5% level). When we introduce campus, department
and time eﬀects however (models 5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b), inventor founded start-ups
perform similarly to established firms. For example, in model 5a, the coeﬃcients
on startups are not significantly diﬀerent from one (0.973), and the corresponding
coeﬃcient for all start-up firms is 0.940 (model 2a, Table 2). Similarly for termination, model 5b reports that like start-ups in the aggregate, inventor founded
start-ups are significantly less likely to terminate a license (0.594, 1% significance
(model 5b) vs. 0.657, 1% significance, model 2b, Table 2). These similar results
with respect to termination indicate that the factors that discourage termination
by start-ups suggest above operate on both inventor and non-inventor startups.
More surprisingly however, is that we see little diﬀerence between inventor founder
start-ups and all start-ups compared to established firms in the hazard rate for
commercialization. We return to this issue below.
14

<-----Page 14----->4.3. Economic Returns on Invention
The above analyses show that start-ups appear to be no more (and no less) likely to
achieve a first-sale event than are established firms, but are less likely to terminate
licenses over time. Overall, these findings are inconclusive whether start-ups are
more or less able to commercialize university inventions than are established firms.
These results are indeed surprising. Specifically, we are intrigued to the extent
that we appear to be witnesses a strong eﬀect favoring either the "Bold Forecasts"
argument articulated by Kahneman and Lovallo (1993) nor an adverse selection
hypothesis to the extent that inventors might keep the inventions most likely or
most feasible to be developed.
We now focus on only those technologies that are commercialized, excluding
terminated and censored observations, to examine whether inventions commercialized by start-ups generate greater or lesser revenues than do those commercialized
by established licensees. To address this question, we employ a tobit analysis of
total royalties and fees paid to the university related to a commercialized invention. We follow Shane (2002) by specifying the log of payments as our dependent
variable, since the distribution of royalties is necessarily truncated on the left at
zero and because a few inventions have extreme positive values ("home runs").
Our sample diﬀers from Shane (2002) since he only examines returns to established firm licensees, rather than comparing royalties generated by start-ups and
established firms. Results for all start-ups are reported in Table 4 and results for
inventor founded start-ups are reported in Table 5.
All the models in Tables 4 and 5 control for time eﬀects (although we do not
report coeﬃcient for year dummies). Turning first to Table 4, tobit regressions for
all start-ups, we find that in the base model (model 7) start ups are more likely to
generate greater earnings on licensed technologies than are existing firms (weakly
significant at the 10% level). When we also control for inventor department
(coeﬃcients not reported), the statistical significance on the start-up coeﬃcient
increases to the one percent level, however (model 8). Model 9 adds campus
dummies - here we see similar results. The coeﬃcient for start-ups is 1.04 and is
significantly diﬀerent from zero at the one percent level. These findings suggest
that measured by revenue generation, start-ups perform better than do established
firms.
Models 10 - 12 in Table 5 report the results of tobit regressions of license
earnings for inventor founded start-ups compared to established firms. The baseline model (model 10) reports that inventor-founded start-ups and established
firms generate similar levels of earnings from licensed technologies. When control
15

<-----Page 15----->variables are introduced (models 11 and 12), inventor founded firms generate a
significantly higher level of earnings, however (at the 10% level when only department dummies are included, but at the 5% level when campus dummies are
added). Overall, these results provide some evidence that start-ups may be more
eﬀective in generating earnings than are established firms.
Finally, model 13 compares earnings generation by inventor-founded start-ups
with other start-ups, excluding established firms. The variable of interest in this
model is Startup_inventor. We find that inventor founded start-ups generate
significantly lower levels of earnings than do non-inventor-founded start-ups (the
coeﬃcient for Startup_inventor is -2.956, significant at the 1% level). It appears
that inventor founded start-ups, despite the advantage of inventor participation,
are less successful in earnings generation than are other start-ups.
This comparison of inventor-founded firms and other start-ups is quite interesting. We may be tempted to cite this as support of Kahneman and Lovallo
(1993). However, we are guarded in making any claims at this point since the success of these other start-ups may be very tied to an advantage in initial resources.
Our interviews and qualitative analysis of inventor-founded firms support the notion that on average UC inventors often had few resources immediately at their
disposal when founding their firms; financial resources were often a combination
of government funding programs and bootstrapping. To the extent that the other
start-ups are often venture capitalists and industry veterans, their initial resource
endowment may be greater, which is a diﬀerent argument than the theory that
behavior is driven by biases related to how an inventor values a given market
opportunity. Clearly, this is an issue that demands further exploration.
4.4. The Process of Development and Commercialization
Perhaps most striking suggestion from the above findings is the apparent lack
of diﬀerence in success rates between start-ups and established firms. Overall,
we found the probability of successful commercialization over time by start-ups
and established firms to be similar. While inventions licensed by all start-ups
generate significantly greater economic returns to the university than inventions
licensed by established firms, this eﬀect is greatly diminished when only examining
inventor-founded start-ups. Thus far, however, our analyses oﬀer little insight on
the development-commercialization process. We now turn to a more qualitative
examination of this process.
Our goal in this paper is to gain insight into the success of start-ups, relative

16

<-----Page 16----->to established firms, in developing and commercializing university inventions. A
related issue is the role that each of these two types of firms play in industrial
organization. The academic literature has debated this question since the work
of Joseph Schumpeter and Frank Knight. Abernathy and Utterback (Abernathy
and Utterback 1978), Christensen (Christensen 1997), and Henderson and Clark
(Henderson and Clark 1990) have each emphasized the often tenuous and competitive relationship between industry entrants, many of which are often start-ups,
and established firms, whereby start-ups may replace established firms entrenched
in the current industry status, for example.
We mentioned earlier the potential importance of complementary assets which
are in short supply at university start-ups, in particular. As argued by Teece,
the act of innovation is only one means by which firms earn economic rents from
new technologies (Teece 1986). Established firms with valuable complementary
assets can extract much of the economic rents related to the introduction of a new
technology. To explore this issue further, we constructed ten year "commercialization histories" of the inventor-founded start-ups in the sample. Table 6 reports
all inventions between 1986 and 1995 licensed to inventor-founded start-ups and
includes the start-ups’ operating status as of June 2002 (operating independently,
defunct, or acquired by an established firm).
Several interesting patterns are consistent with our earlier analysis. First,
virtually all start-ups that commercialized an invention were acquired, and all but
two of these firms were acquired prior to commercialization. Most unacquired
firms remain in product development with no significant sales. Note that the
greatest return to the University of California among the independent start-ups
was through the proceeds of an initial public oﬀering, not from royalties based on
commercial sales.
The results reported in Table 6 indicate that start-ups and established firms
may operate as complementary, rather than substitute vehicles for commercialization of some technologies in university licensing. These findings are suggestive,
rather than conclusive, however, and we plan to pursue this issue further in future
research.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we explored commercialization outcomes of university technologies
licensed by start-up firms, measured by the time to first sale, time to termination,
and level of earnings. Utilizing a novel data set of almost two decades of licens17

<-----Page 17----->ing activity at the University of California, we have compared these start-ups’
performance with those of established firms licensing similar technologies.
Two striking findings arise from this initial analysis. First, start-up firms in
general reach first sale, on average, more quickly than do existing firms, however
this result appears to be produced by technology field eﬀects - that is, the technology areas where start-ups are likely to occur. Conversely, start-up firms are more
likely to exhibit persistence in the commercialization eﬀort than their established
counterparts - taking longer to terminate a license on average for those that are
terminated. Start-up also firms appear to generate higher levels of earnings than
our comparable established firms.
Overall, our findings suggest that, contrary to the finding in Shane (2002),
inventor-founded start-up firms appear to perform as well, and by some measures,
at a higher level than the established firms in our sample. Second, start-up
firms generate greater economic returns on average than established firms, though
other start-ups perform better than inventor-founded start-ups. This data rejects
the Bold Forecast theory that university inventors overvalue commercialization
opportunities ex ante in the decision to found a firm. At best, there may be
some evidence for an ex post version of the theory: inventors appear to hold on
to technologies without commercial success longer than do established firms.
This observation is also easily explained by previous findings that university
inventors license inventions which are on average more tacit and require greater
inventor eﬀort (and presumably time) to develop (Lowe 2003, Shane 2002). Several
alternative explanations may account for this diﬀerence; established firms may
have more opportunities to use development resources than start-ups and thus
impose a higher threshold for continuing development projects, or entrepreneurs
may be less willing to admit failure or abandon technological pursuit, for example.
Another explanation could arise from the source of funding: commercialization
for many university inventions occurs through government grants which impose
little monitoring on commercialization outcomes, allowing start-ups to endure on
projects with little commercial prospects. Documenting the diﬀerence in time-totermination in greater detail may shed greater light on the process of development
and commercialization.
What might explain the empirical diﬀerences between our regression results
and those of Shane (2002)? One possible explanation is diﬀerences in sampling we examine inventions licensed from the University of California system and Shane
studies inventions from MIT. The policies of these two universities are not the
same - UC is more likely seek patenting for an invention only after it has identified
18

<-----Page 18----->a potential licensee willing to reimburse patenting costs. In contrast, our discussions with licensing oﬃcers and inventors suggest that MIT was more aggressive in
seeking patent protection for its inventions compared to UC, more often incurring
costs before a licensee has been identified. This policy diﬀerence may bias the
results toward better expected performance for UC patents in general relative to
the MIT sample (since the UC inventions have been selected by industrial firms
for commercial potential). It is also possible that established firms are better
able to "understand" the market and have superior marketing and manufacturing capabilities than entrepreneurs, and thus select more promising inventions for
commercialization. On the other hand, inventor-founders may have a deeper
technical understanding of technologies they select for licensing. Since many university technologies are licensed at early stages (Jensen and Thursby 2001), this
understanding may be a significant advantage for the inventor. We have little
reason to believe, therefore, that these diﬀerences would generate a systematic
diﬀerence in the "quality" of inventions sought to be licensed by start-ups and
established firms11 .
This leads to our second significant finding: when our inventor founded startup firms do achieve commercialization, they do so virtually always only after being
acquired by an established firm. This result supports another reinterpretation of
the Shane (2002) findings. As Shane (2002) points out, established firms have a
competitive advantage in commercializing inventions. Conversely, inventors often have a comparative advantage in development when the knowledge necessary
to further develop the invention is largely tacit (Lowe 2003). We propose that
considering the commercial outcomes such as time to first sale or termination
of licenses without a more detailed examination of the mode of commercialization reveals only part of the entrepreneurial story. This discussion illustrates the
delicate balance between established firms’ comparative advantage in commercialization, through superior access to complementary assets, resources, and market
knowledge, and inventors’ comparative advantage in technology development for
particular types of technologies.
11

Another explanation is the diﬀerence in how results are interpreted in their respective analyses. Shane interprets from his findings that inventor-founded start-up firms are less likely to
achieve commercialization and more likely to terminate a license than are established firms. This
conclusion is based on negative coeﬃcients for interaction terms of start-up firms and measures
of patent eﬀectiveness. In the same regression models, however, the "main eﬀect"— that is, the
coeﬃcient on the start-up firm variable alone— was significant and in the same direction as our
coeﬃcients for both the commercialization and termination regressions (see Tables 5 and 6 of
Shane 2002).

19

<-----Page 19----->Entrepreneurs function within a "market for ideas" and may choose a strategy
of "competition" or "cooperation" with established firms (Gans and Stern 2000;
Gans, Hsu, and Stern 2002). Once they have licensed a university technology,
entrepreneurs are not "locked-in" over time to pursuing commercialization on
their own, but may later choose to "cooperate," via joint venture, acquisition,
or other linkages with established firms. Without the entrepreneurial role of
the inventor-founder however, some technologies would be left to languish, or
licensed by established firms then unsuccessfully commercialized, as illustrated by
our introductory examples. Thus, inventor-founded firms may serve a transitional
organization form in the market for technology commercialization and this division
of labor — development in start-ups, commercialization in established firms. This
appears to be particularly descriptive of inventor-founded start-ups.
As mentioned above, Lowe (2003) shows that for early stage technologies characterized by a significant tacit knowledge component, it is diﬃcult to transfer the
requisite knowledge necessary for successful commercialization. These diﬃculties
suggest that in order to capture a large part of the economic value of the nascent
technology, the inventor must lead the development eﬀort herself. Once suﬃcient
development has occurred and been signalled to the marketplace, then acquisition
may be an eﬀective vehicle for joining the deep understanding of the technology
by the inventor with the market-related complementary assets possessed by the
incumbent.
The outcomes reported in Table 6 support this. In a future version of this
paper, we plan to explore this hypothesis in greater detail by examining the timing
of such acquisitions relative to technology development. More specifically, we will
examine the relationships between ownership changes and the timing and total
economic return on the inventions in this dataset. We also plan to expand the
data to include more recent years.
Our findings at this point are suggestive rather than conclusive. As such, they
are not without significant limitations. Nevertheless, our preliminary findings offer insight into the commercialization process of licensed university technologies.
Entrepreneurs appear to "hold their own" relative to more established firms, particularly in the commercialization of early stage inventions requiring substantial
technological development. Because a stated goal of most university technology
transfer professionals is the development and introduction to the market products
based on university research, our evidence suggests that the active pursuit of startup licensing is worthwhile. Moreover, the relationship between established firms
and start-ups in high tech industries appears to be a complicated process and may
20

<-----Page 20----->function as a "division of labor," one that would be coordinated by market forces.
This conception may provide a better link between theories of entrepreneurship
and the larger industrial organization and technology management literatures.
