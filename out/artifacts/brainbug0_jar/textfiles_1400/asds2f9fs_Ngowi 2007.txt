Abstract
The ensuing globalization of the construction industry as well as the highly fragmented and divisive nature of the industry are among
the forces that are inﬂuencing it to seek management approaches such as strategic alliances that could leverage the capabilities of the
various participants. This paper reports on a study that investigated the factors considered by ﬁrms when selecting alliance partners, and
the inﬂuence of trustworthiness in deciding the governance structures of the alliances. A study of key partners in existing and potential
construction alliances in Botswana that was carried out using a postal questionnaire and structured interviews determined that ﬁrms
consider complementarity, similar status, indirect prior alliance experience and reputation before they make a selection of an alliance
partner. The study also determined that partner trustworthiness eliminates the need of contractual clauses in the operation of the
alliances. The paper concludes that trustworthiness of a partner is an inﬂuencing factor in all stages of the alliance development.

1. Introduction
Partnering between a client and a contractor is one form
of alliance between parties that are not in direct competition with one another. Several studies suggest that such an
approach leads to more successful procurement of projects
than other traditional management approaches [1–3]. As a
way of enhancing construction project delivery and
improving their construction supply chains, many countries are encouraging their construction industries to
embrace partnering [4–6]. Some construction projects, such
as facilities for oil or natural gas extraction in the middle of
a sea are so large and sophisticated that no one ﬁrm can
undertake them alone. Similarly, construction ﬁrms in
most developing countries are too small to carry out large
construction projects alone. Thus, besides partnering
between a client and a contractor, there is an incentive
for forming alliances between contractors so that the

emerging entities can handle large and sophisticated
projects that they cannot do individually.
However, alliance between ﬁrms that are engaged in
similar activities has both cooperative and competitive
aspects. While the former enables the ﬁrms to leverage their
complementary capabilities for common beneﬁts, the latter
tend to push the allied ﬁrms to engage in competitive racing
in learning the capability of the partner(s) for private
beneﬁts [7]. Often, when the learning is complete the
incentive to continue the alliance ceases and this may lead
to its break up [8].
The purpose of this paper is to report on a study
that was carried out in Botswana to determine the
factors that ﬁrms use to select alliance partners, and
establish the role of trustworthiness in deciding the
governance structure of the alliances. The paper begins
by describing alliances in the construction industry. It
then deﬁnes trust and related concepts of trustworthiness
and opportunism. Next it describes the role of trust in
alliances, after which a study in Botswana is reported and
discussed.

2. Alliances in the construction industry
The globalization of the construction industry is rendering the familiar model of a single company doing all things
in-house outdated. The technological, political, ﬁnancial
and competitive capabilities that are required to operate in
the global construction market means that companies need
to establish alliances with other participants in order to
survive. Alliances are deﬁned as voluntary arrangements
between ﬁrms involving exchange, sharing or co-development of products, technologies or services [9]. They
can occur as a result of a wide range of motives and goals,
take a variety of forms and occur across vertical and
horizontal boundaries. There is a distinction among
alliance structures in terms of the degree of hierarchical
elements they embody and the extent to which they
replicate the control and coordination features associated
with organizations, which are considered to be the
hierarchical end of the spectrum [10,11]. At one end are
joint ventures, which involve partners creating new entity
in which they share equity and which most closely replicate
the hierarchical control features of organizations. At the
other end are alliances such as partnering with no
sharing of equity and having few hierarchical controls
built in them [11].
In the construction industry, joint ventures are employed
when parties that are involved in similar activities, such as
contractors joining forces to leverage their complimentary
capabilities to carry out work. This occurs in situations
where risks are too high for subcontracting to be viable.
However, joint ventures are simultaneously cooperative
and competitive enterprises. The cooperative aspect arises
from the fact that each ﬁrm needs access to the other ﬁrm’s
know-how and that the ﬁrms can collectively use their
knowledge to produce something that is beneﬁcial to them
all (common beneﬁts). The competitive aspect is a
consequence of each ﬁrm’s attempt to also use its partner’s
know-how for private gains, and of the possibility that
signiﬁcantly greater beneﬁts might accrue to the ﬁrm that
ﬁnishes learning from its partner before the latter can do
the same [7]. As a result of this, the choice of a partner is
carried out carefully and as stated by various scholars (e.g.
[12–14]) partners will consider the following factors in
determining how to establish the alliances: complementarity, status similarity and social capital.
Partnering on the other hand, is essentially the establishment of an informal group among construction partners
such as a client and a contractor to create ‘‘permanent’’
relationship. It has been increasingly applied in the North
American construction industry [1], and has also been
widely adopted in other places [15]. The construction
literature contains numerous deﬁnitions of partnering (e.g.
[16–19]). Crowley and Karim [20] deﬁne partnering as
‘‘yan organization that implements a cooperative strategy
modifying and supplementing the traditional boundaries
that separate companies in a competitive climate. In this
way, partnering wraps the major project participants into

1829

an alliance that creates a cohesive atmosphere for the
project team members to openly interact and perform’’.
The literature distinguishes two types of partnering: project
partnering (relationship established for a single project)
and strategic partnering (a long-term commitment beyond
a discrete project). Strategic partnering can secure longterm beneﬁts whereas project partnering ﬁts for a single
project. Whether it is project or strategic partnering,
Saad and Hancher [21] view partnering as an effective
management tool to navigate the project management
process from the planning phase to the commissioning/
start-up phase, via the design, procurement and construction phases since it can be incorporated into each of the ﬁve
phases.
During the life of alliances, the internal and external
circumstances may change, often in unexpected ways (in
the construction industry circumstances continuously
change). How partners adapt to these changing circumstances determines whether an alliance prospers or
ﬂounders [22]. Successful adaptation of these changes calls
for a delicate balance between the twin virtues of reliability
and ﬂexibility. Flexibility is necessary for partners to have a
viable relationship in the face of changing circumstances,
yet unlimited ﬂexibility affords companies the opportunity
and incentive to cheat, reducing the reliance partners can
place on each other [23]. There are thus two types of
uncertainties in alliances: uncertainty regarding unknown
future events, and uncertainty regarding partner’s response
to those future events. It is in this environment of double
uncertainty that trust emerges as a central organizing
principle in alliances [24].
2.1. Trust defined
Coleman [13] deﬁnes trust as ‘‘committing to an
exchange before you know how the other person will
reciprocate’’. Sabel [25] puts it more succinctly ‘‘trust is the
mutual conﬁdence that no party to an exchange will exploit
another’s vulnerabilities’’. Parties to an exchange can be
vulnerable when they ﬁnd it very costly to evaluate
accurately the quality of the resources or assets others
assert they will bring to an exchange [26], or to evaluate
accurately the quality of resources or assets others are
actually offering in exchange [27]. Also when parties to an
exchange make large asymmetric transaction, they are
subject to hold-up vulnerabilities [28]. To put in other
words, trust has the following main attributes:
(i) it inherently involves uncertainty about the future;
(ii) it implies vulnerability, that is, the risk of losing
something of value. The magnitude of this potential
loss from untrustworthy behaviour is typically much
greater than the anticipated gains from trustworthy
behaviour; and
(iii) it is placed in another whose behaviour is not under
one’s control, so each partner exercises duly partial
inﬂuence over alliance outcomes.

The literature on trust contains various insight regarding
cooperative relationships and the role of trust (e.g.
[29–32]). Some researchers (e.g. [33–37]) have observed
that, while trust is the mutual conﬁdence that one’s
vulnerabilities will not be exploited in an exchange,
different types of trust can exist in different economic
exchanges. Accordingly, three types of trust can be
identiﬁed: weak form trust, semi-strong trust, and strong
trust. Weak form trust emerges because there are limited
opportunities for opportunism. Semi-strong form trust
depends on governance devices such as a market for
reputation and contracts to safeguard against threat of
opportunism. Strong form trust emerges in response to a
set of internalized norms and principles that guide the
behaviour of exchange partners, and is independent of
whether or not speciﬁc governance mechanism exists.
Trust also hinges on expectation held by an agent that its
exchange partner will behave in a mutually acceptable
manner (including an expectation that neither party will
exploit the other’s vulnerabilities). This expectation narrows the set of possible actions, thus reducing the
uncertainty surrounding the partner’s actions. Sako [36]
categorized reasons for predictability in behaviour to
distinguish between three types of trust: contractual trust
(will the other party carry out its contractual agreements?);
competence trust (is the other party capable of doing what
it says it will do?); and goodwill trust (will the other party
make an open-ended commitment to take initiatives for
mutual beneﬁt while refraining from unfair advantage
taking?).

3. Trust in alliances
As cooperation and competition coexist between alliance
partners, cooperative relationship evolves over time as
partners learn more about each other’s motives, capabilities and attitudes toward control, conﬂict, cooperation
and competition. During this period, and the entire life of
the alliance the partners are vulnerable in the various ways
mentioned earlier. Thus, in successful alliances, trust is
often touted as a prerequisite, a necessity, an absolute must
[38]. The converse is also true: a major contributor to failed
alliances is lack of trust [39].
Trust is central for strategic alliances for three main
reasons: Firstly, no contract or agreement, no matter how
complete or detailed, can account for every issue or every
contingency that might arise. Formal contracts, for
instance, can never anticipate and identify all the events
and changes that occur over the lifetime of the strategic
alliance. Secondly, the alliance of two or more creates a
strong potential for dysfunctional conﬂict and mistrust as
the partners differ in organizational cultures and management philosophies, among others. Thirdly, learning that is
often cited as one of the major beneﬁts and motivations for
strategic alliances may suffer if the partners do not trust
each other.

4. A study in Botswana
4.1. Background
With a total area of 582,000 km2 and a population of 1.7
million people [40], Botswana has experienced rapid
growth since the time of independence in 1966. The
construction industry has constituted 7.5–10 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and during the current
ﬁve-year development plan (NDP9) spanning between
2003–2009 Botswana will invest a total of P 25 billion
(US$5.5 billion) in infrastructure development.
Construction ﬁrms that intend to undertake public works
are required to register with the Public Procurement and
Asset Disposal Board (PPADB) that was established in 2002
to take over the functions of the former Central Tender
Board. The PPADB has six categories of building and civil
engineering contractors as shown on Table 1. Categories
OC, A and B are reserved for citizen contractors while in
categories C, D, and E foreign ﬁrms are allowed to register.
Over the years, the Government of Botswana has
realized that to maintain the pace envisioned for her
economic and infrastructure development, the active
involvement of foreign capital, technology and management know-how should be encouraged. To ensure that
foreign contractors that operate in the local construction
market participate in raising the capabilities of local
contractors, the government has encouraged formation of
joint ventures and has provided preferential schemes where
there is equity majority by local partners.
At the same time, the government has encouraged local
construction ﬁrms that are small compared to their foreign
counterparts to form alliances among themselves so that
the emerging entities can handle large and sophisticated
projects. As a response to this encouragement, a number of
strategic alliances have been established beginning from
early 1980s [41].
4.2. Objectives of the study
The objectives of the study were:

To assess the factors that are used in selecting alliance
partners; and



To establish the role of trustworthiness in deciding the
governance structure of the alliances.

A two-part study involving ﬁrms that have formed or
were contemplating to form construction alliances was
carried out in Gaborone, the capital city of Botswana.
Part 1 of the study involved a questionnaire survey. The
survey asked respondents to evaluate the factors that
inﬂuenced them to select their partners. The respondents
were identiﬁed at an earlier seminar that was organized by
the Ministry of Works and Transport to discuss the
implementation of Public and Private Partnership (PPP) in
Botswana. At this seminar, which was attended by 97
people, the details of the participants who have formed or
were in the process of forming construction alliances in
response to government encouragement were taken. A
total of 21 participants were identiﬁed and their particulars
were conﬁrmed at the PPADB registration department,
where additional 7 ﬁrms were found to have registered as
being in the process of forming alliances. Out of these
ﬁrms, 6 have existing alliances and the remaining 22 have
initiated the process of forming alliances having identiﬁed
potential partners. Two (2) of the ﬁrms are registered in
category A, 16 in category B and 10 in category C.
Questionnaires were sent to all 28 ﬁrms.
The addressees were reminded about the return of the
questionnaires by telephone and the researcher offered to
collect the ones that had not been returned by the set
deadline. This ensured a 100% return rate. The factors that
are considered in selecting an alliance partner are shown in
Table 2.
The factor of complementarity was operationalized by
the statement ‘‘We create excess value by pooling our
resources relative to their value before pooling’’. There was
strong agreement with this statement: agree strongly (94%)
and agree (3%); and this concurs with observation by
many researchers (e.g. [10,42]) that by pooling their
resources and capabilities with those of their partners,
ﬁrms can initiate projects that they could not have
successfully done alone. For a ﬁrm attempting such a
project, the consideration of the resource complementarity
becomes an important issue [10,42]. Similarly, Doz [43]

1831

observes that the complementarity of strengths and assets
between ﬁrms is often clear even prior to negotiations on
the terms of alliances because it is what brings the partners
together in the ﬁrst place.
The factor of similar status was operationalized by the
statement ‘‘Our similar status will promote social interaction’’. There was a strong agreement to the statement:
strongly agree (36%) and agree (50%) and this is consistent
with observation by researchers (e.g. [44–46]). Often, ﬁrms
considering alliances assess both the complementary
capabilities and the status of their potential partners.
Firms of similar status are likely to ally with each other for
three possible reasons: Firstly, as is the case with
individuals ﬁrms of similar status are more likely to
collaborate with each other because of the signaling role
of social interaction [44]; Secondly, the process of
competitive isomorphism is likely to result in ﬁrms of
similar status having similar or compatible operating
systems and practices [45]. When ﬁrms compete with each
other on the basis of their status, ﬁrms of similar status will
be in a similar competitive environment. Therefore,
competitive isomorphism will lead ﬁrms of similar status
to have similar or compatible operating systems and
practices, which is a catalyst in helping partner ﬁrms to
cooperate more effectively with each other [46]; Thirdly, a
ﬁrm also tends to seek a partner of similar status because
doing so makes it more likely that both parties will exhibit
increased levels of fairness and commitment to sharing
both the costs and beneﬁts of an alliance.
The factor of direct prior alliance experience was
operationalized by the statement ‘‘We prefer to deal with
a partner with whom we have prior experience’’. The
responses indicate a disagreement: strongly disagree (18%),
disagree (57%) and not sure (14%). This is contrary to
observations by researchers (e.g. [34]) that in forming
strategic alliances, a natural solution for a ﬁrm is to ﬁrst
consider previous partners with which it has direct prior
alliance experiences. Moreover, in establishing a long-time
relationship each partner has to invest a substantial
amount of time and energy [47] and this investment is a
ﬁxed or sunk cost, which is impossible to recover when
switching transaction partners. The explanation for these

contradicting responses is that construction ﬁrms in
Botswana have often interacted with one another in such
ways as subcontracting or plant/material supplying in
response to government encouragement. Most of these
interactions have ended bitterly, through arbitration or
other legal recourses. Either the respondents have been
victims in these conﬂicts or they know ﬁrms that have been
victims.
The factor of indirect prior alliance experience was
operationalized by the statement ‘‘We can rely on a referee
to prevent our partner from taking unfair advantage of our
ﬁrm’’. The responses to this factor are in agreement with
the statement: strongly agree (21%) and agree (50%).
Indirect ties between two ﬁrms through a third party may
enhance the chances that the two ﬁrms will form a strategic
alliance because the indirect ties can function as an
information conduit and because a common actor can
play the role of a reference and become a mechanism for
deterring opportunistic behaviours. According to Uzzi [48]
when a common actor has built a trustworthy relationship
with two other actors, it will refer each party favourably to
the other party in need of alliance partners. Social relations
make information transferred through those relations
credible and interpretable because the identity of actors
and the intensity of their social ties are important as the
information itself.
The factor of reputation was operationalized by the
statement ‘‘We prefer to deal with a partner whose
reputation is above board’’. The responses are in agreement with the statement: agree strongly (21%), agree
(71%) and not sure (8%). This should be expected given
the number of complaints that have been lodged by various
parties in Botswana that most contractors have poor
credibility. It, therefore, follows that before any ﬁrm
decides to deal with another, it has to seek information
regarding the reputation of the potential partner. Gaining a
reputation as a trustworthy exchange partner occurs over
time as the exchange partner confronts situations where
opportunistic behaviour is possible, but chooses not to
engage in opportunistic activities. There is no opportunity
cost associated with a trustworthy ﬁrm not behaving
opportunistically, since such behaviour is not in this kind
of exchange partner’s opportunity set. On the other hand, a

non-trustworthy exchange partner will have to absorb
opportunity costs each time they decide not to behave in an
opportunistic way.
Part 2 of the study involved structured interviews with
the CEOs of the 6 ﬁrms that have existing alliances. Face to
face interviews based on how much trust they could place
on their partners were held with each CEO in their ofﬁces
for 45 min. The questions were based on the three-way
categorization of trust developed by Sako [36]. The
characteristics of these alliances are shown in Table 3.
Note that the ﬁrms are coded for reasons of anonymity,
which was their precondition for participating in the study.
The following are the interview questions, summary of
responses and discussions.
What type of governance structures are employed in your
alliance?
The responses to this question determined that the two
sustained alliances, i.e. A and B have employed different
types of governance structures at different times. At the
inception of the alliances it was felt necessary that all the
contractual clauses should be clariﬁed and written down.
However, after successfully carrying out more than two
projects, the partners got to know each other better and
hence the need for strict contractual procedures was found
unnecessary. The use of contractual clauses indicates that
the partners were maintaining contractual trust at the
inception of the alliances and as soon as they found out
that the other party would carry out its contractual
agreements, the trust level started to shift. The partners
in alliance C had known and worked with each other prior
to the formation of the alliance and they responded by
saying that they did not need any contractual clauses to
work together. However, during the formation of alliance
C a contract of operational procedures was signed by the
two partners. On a follow-up question on how long the
partners maintain contractual trust before it shifts to
another type, all respondents stated that the speed of
moving from contractual to goodwill trust depends on the
length of interaction, which is often determined by the
number of projects the alliance has successfully carried out.
This concurs with observation by Sako [36] that a move
from contractual trust to goodwill trust involves a gradual
expansion in the congruence in beliefs about what is

acceptable behaviour. This can only happen when partners
in an alliance get opportunity to interact with each other.
Do you always follow the advice given by your partner?
This question intended to establish whether the partners
in the alliance trusted that the counterpart was capable of
doing what it says it will do. Although there was a
unanimous response that the advice was always followed,
the respondents indicated that at the formation of the
alliances each partner was cautious about such advice. It
was only after working together on a number of projects
and observing that the other party was conducting itself
professionally, and was conversant with the relevant
technical and managerial standards that the partners were
convinced that the other party was capable of delivering
what it promised. Once this stage was reached, each party
in the alliance allowed the other to make decisions without
prior consultations. The responses are consistent with
observations by Sako [36] that competence trust requires a
shared understanding of professional conduct and relevant
standards.
Have you ever made investments into the alliance that are
not stipulated in the agreement?
This question intended to establish whether the partners
in the alliances trust each other enough to make unilateral
investments without fear of loss due to opportunistic action
of the counterpart. All respondents indicated that they
have made unilateral investments in favour of the alliances,
which were not stipulated in the agreements. For instance,
the CEO of ﬁrm b2 indicated that he let his land on the
outskirts of Gaborone to be used as plant and material

1833

storage yard instead of hiring the same from the market.
He also paid to join a consortium that developed a quarry
pit with associated crusher plant so that the alliance could
get easy access to ﬁne and course aggregates. The other
CEOs gave similar examples, but they varied in type and
value. These responses are consistent with ﬁndings by
researchers (e.g. [36,37]). According to Sako [36] goodwill
trust is reached when partners in an alliance make an openended commitment to take initiative for mutual beneﬁt
while refraining from unfair advantage taking. Similarly,
Barney and Hansen [37] observe that strong form trust
emerges in response to a set of internalized norms and
principles that guide the behaviour of exchange partners,
and is independent of whether or not speciﬁc governance
mechanisms exist.
Given the chance, do you think your partner may take an
unfair advantage on your business?
This question intended to determine whether the
partners had any suspicions that the other party might
act opportunistically. The notion of trust implies that the
partner has freedom of choice to take alternative courses of
action. Thus, predictability in behaviour arises not because
of constraints that force the other side to stick to a single
possible course of action. All respondents indicated that
they do not think that the other party would act
opportunistically given the opportunity. The CEOs of
ﬁrms in alliance A (i.e. a1and a2), for instance, indicated
situations that the other party could have taken advantage,
but did not. As it was observed earlier, gaining a reputation
as a trustworthy partner occurs over time, and once it is

gained the ﬁrm would not like to lose it through
opportunistic activities.
Looking at the framework for establishing and maintaining trust in construction alliances, how far does the process
apply to your alliance?
The respondents were shown the framework for building
and maintaining trust in construction alliances (Table 4)
and taken through the three stages.
The responses indicated that they were in agreement with
the three stages and that their alliances went through them.
However, they indicated that the trustworthiness of the
partner plays a role in all three states. In the formation
stage (stage 1), for instance, the respondents in alliances A
and B indicated that they carefully studied signals of
trustworthiness on their potential partners before they
decided to form alliances with each other. They indicated
that they carefully checked the reputation, compliance with
taxation regime and construction related investments of the
potential partner. As partners in alliance C had known
each other for a long time, they were aware of each other’s
trustworthiness.
At the operation stage (stage 2) all respondents indicated
that they judged trustworthiness of their partners through
their openness to outside auditing of their activities. Firm
a1, for instance, indicated that it asked the partner a2 to
provide an auditor for their operations, while it provided
an accountant to ensure that their operations were always
above board. This may appear contradictory to the spirit
of trust, but willingness to be open to outside auditing was
said to reinforce trustworthiness.
At the growth stage (stage 3) all respondents indicated
that they judged the trustworthiness of their partners
through the unilateral transaction-speciﬁc investments they
made in the partnership beyond what was prescribed in
their agreements.
5. Conclusions
Strategic alliances can be formed by ﬁrms that are not in
direct competition with one another or by ﬁrms that are
engaged in similar activities, hence in direct competition.
This study intended to determine the factors that ﬁrms use
in selecting partners when forming alliances, and the
inﬂuence of trustworthiness of alliance partners in deciding
governance structures of the alliances.
Literature review established that various forms of
strategic alliances exist in a spectrum ranging from joint
ventures to partnering. As there exists uncertainties
regarding unknown future events on the one hand, and
regarding partner’s response to those events on the other
hand, trust has emerged as a central organizing principle in
alliances.
This study established that in Botswana potential
alliance partners consider complementarity, similar status,
indirect prior alliance experience and reputation when
selecting a counterpart. Within the limitations of the
available data, the study established that alliance partners

start with contractual trust, which develops to goodwill
trust based on the number of projects executed by the
alliance. The study also determined that partners’ trustworthiness inﬂuence the conduct of the partners in all
stages of alliance development.
The study veriﬁed that the three stages of the framework
for building and maintaining trust in construction alliances
[49] are valid for the existing alliances, and they could be a
valuable lesson for the ﬁrms that are in the process of
forming alliances.
As this study was based on only three known alliances
and 22 ﬁrms that are in the process of forming alliances, it
is recommended to monitor the development of the
alliances that are currently at the formation stage with
the aim of passing on to them the experiences learned by
the three existing alliances. It is also recommended to
extend the study to a wider market, such as South African
Development Community (SADC) to determine whether
there are ﬁndings that can improve the alliances based in
Botswana and vice versa.
