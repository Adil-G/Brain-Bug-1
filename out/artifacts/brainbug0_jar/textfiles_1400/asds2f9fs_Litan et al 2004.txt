Abstract
With the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, the federal government explicitly
endorsed the transfer of exclusive control over government-funded inventions to
universities and businesses operating with federal contracts. While this
legislation was intended to accelerate further development and
commercialization of the ideas and inventions developed under federal contracts,
the government did not provide any strategy, process, tools, or resources to
shepherd innovations from the halls of academia into the commercial market.
And more than twenty-five years later, it is clear that few universities have
established an overall strategy to foster innovation, commercialization, and
spillovers. Multiple pathways for university innovation exist and can be codified
to provide broader access to innovation, allow a greater volume of deal flow,
support standardization, and decrease the redundancy of innovation and the
cycle time for commercialization. Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) were
envisioned as gateways to facilitate the flow of innovation but have instead
become gatekeepers that in many cases constrain the flow of inventions and
frustrate faculty, entrepreneurs, and industry. The proposed changes focus on
creating incentives that will maximize social benefit from the existing investments
being made in R&D and commercialization on university campuses.

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 2

<-----Page 2----->I. Introduction
Today we take for granted the rapid pace of technological progress that has
carried many national economies forward for the past 200 years. Continued
innovation that has diffused through the marketplace has made this progress
possible. In turn, entrepreneurs have been instrumental in commercializing
innovations, especially the radical or breakthrough innovations—such as the
automobile, airplane, air conditioner, personal computer, among others—that
have transformed economies and societies in fundamental ways that the more
typical incremental innovations associated with large corporate enterprises have
not (Baumol 2002).
As technologies have grown more sophisticated and emerging industries have
become more high-tech, universities have become more important players in the
processes of invention, innovation, and commercialization. We have written this
paper largely because we anticipate universities playing an even more important
role in the innovation process in the future.
To be sure, bringing innovations to market has not been the main historical role
of university-based researchers. Instead, university researchers quite
appropriately concentrate on basic science. But the ultimate aim of scientific
research, after all, is to improve the human condition and so aiding the transfer
and commercialization of discoveries serves the interests of the inventor and
society. “Since the Industrial Revolution, the growth of economies around the
world has been driven largely by the pursuit of scientific understanding, the
application of engineering solutions, and continual technological innovation”
(National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering 2006).
Ideally, university structures should support all aspects of this process, from
invention to innovation, as well as commercialization.
In theory, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was supposed to make commercialization
easier by clearing the way for universities to claim legal rights to innovations
developed by their faculty using federal funding. This clearly was a constructive
step forward. But with new rights came new layers of administration and often
bureaucracies. Rather than implementing broad innovation/commercialization
strategies that recognized different and appropriate pathways of
commercialization, as well as multiple programs and initiatives to support each
path, many universities focused on the creation of one centralized Technology
Transfer Office (or TTO). Often this office was expected to be the gatekeeper or
protector of university Intellectual Property (IP) or the maximizer of revenue
streams rather than the grease in the gears that allowed the system to flourish.
Thus, while many of the university TTOs met their narrow mandate by channeling
university-generated inventions into generating revenue for the university, the
broader and more fundamental goal of the original Bayh-Dole Act remains

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 3

<-----Page 3----->elusive—to maximize the potential for university-based inventions to result in
commercialized new products and innovations.
What can be done to better achieve this essential objective? What should be
done? Our central purpose here is to answer these questions. We begin with a
brief background of university research, move on to discuss the emergence of
technology transfer as a university goal, and then describe how technology
transfer exists on most campuses today. We believe the current process is suboptimal, however, and thus offer universities several alternative pathways to
enhance and accelerate commercialization and spillover activities. These
alternatives all are predicated on the view that society is likely to benefit more if
universities seek to maximize the volume and speed of their commercialization
activities rather than pursue the conventional objective of maximizing licensing
revenue.

II. Financing of University Research: A Brief Background
For several decades after World War II, most research and development (R&D)
in the United States was financed by the federal government, specifically through
the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the
Department of Defense. By 1979, industry R&D expenditures passed
government spending, growing more than three-fold after controlling for inflation
between 1975 and 2000. By comparison, while government funded R&D rose
quickly after the war, since 1975 it has inched up about 75 percent (National
Science Foundation 2006). Government funded R&D has focused,
appropriately, more on basic than applied research, while the priorities of private
R&D spending have been reversed.
Insert Figures 1, 2 and 3 about here.
As Figure 2 shows, industry performance of government funded R&D rose
quickly from 1955 to the early 1960s, but has since fluctuated significantly.
Conversely, universities and colleges have shown a steady acceleration in their
R&D performance, particularly with basic research. Today, more than half of
basic research is conducted in universities (Figure 3). And while much less is
spent on basic science than on applied science, the absolute dollars of funding
going into basic science are a misleading indicator of its importance, since basic
science stands at the base of our economic “pyramid.” It is breakthroughs in
basic science, after all, that have created new industries.
U.S. institutions of higher learning and their research output appear to be in good
shape, remaining atop the standard global rankings. But there are several
disturbing signs beneath the surface:

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 4

<-----Page 4----->

The United States has experienced stagnant to declining levels of
industrial R&D investments, decreasing industry-university coauthorships, and decreasing citations of U.S. science and engineering
articles by industry (Rapoport 2006).



There is some indication that foreign-sourced R&D is being driven by
access to foreign universities and that the type of research being
performed in developing countries is increasingly innovative in nature
(Thursby and Thursby 2006).



Industry investments in U.S. university-based R&D have stagnated.
Insert Figures 4 and 5 about here.
Insert Table 1 about here.

For forty years, funding from industry to universities steadily rose and now for
four consecutive years, universities have seen stagnation in industry support at
the aggregate and micro level. It is too early to know whether this is a long-term
trend, let alone the reasons for it, but there is reason for concern.
Anecdotally, it appears that relative to some foreign universities, U.S. universities
are becoming less friendly to collaborations and commercialization. In particular,
U.S. universities historically have benefited significantly from an inflow of R&D
capital from U.S. affiliates of foreign companies (particularly European
companies). These benefits are threatened, however, by a growth in bureaucracy
and an increasing (and short-sighted) emphasis on the part of U.S. universities
on securing intellectual property rights to inventions by their faculty. If these two
trends continue, the flow of R&D funding from these U.S. affiliates is likely to
slow, if not reverse.
Insert Figure 6 and Figure 7 about here.
In short, if the U.S. economy is to continue its rapid pace of economic growth, it
will be necessary not only to adopt innovations from other parts of the world but
also to make investments in basic research in a setting that supports
commercialization, spillovers, and general interactions between academic
researchers and industry. In the discussion that follows, we will briefly discuss
the ways in which universities and industry currently interact, paying particular
attention to Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) that are now found on many
campuses. Outside the TTO setting, universities and industry also engage with
each other in a host of ways that can be better understood and nurtured for the
health of both parties. We will discuss the important role that culture appears to
play on university campuses at the departmental level, and how universities must
consider more than just their policies toward TTOs if they want to encourage and
support invention and entrepreneurship.

<-----Page 5----->III. The Rise of University Technology Transfer
When Harry Steenbock demonstrated a means of fortifying Vitamin D in food and
drugs through a process called irradiation, he became concerned with how the
technology would be implemented. Specifically, Steenbock recognized that
unqualified individuals or organizations could use his invention, and possibly do
harm, unless he brought it to market with legal protection – that is, a patent. The
University of Wisconsin, where Steenbock worked at the time, declined his offer
of patent ownership. Working with alumni, Steenbock instead created WARF, a
separate entity that was university-affiliated and could accept patents, license
them out, and disperse revenues back to the inventor and the university without
exposing the university to potential financial and political liability. And thus, in
1924 the nation’s oldest TTO was conceived (Sampat 2006).
It took another fifty years for the confluence of changing federal law, patterns of
R&D investment, knowledge-intensive emerging industries, shifting focus in
regional economic development, a growing knowledge of commercialization
success stories, and declining levels of public support for universities to rapidly
accelerate the practice that Steenbock helped to establish.
Insert Figure 8 about here.
By the 1960s and 1970s, formal endorsement of technology transfer from
federally-funded research was bubbling up on the federal policy agenda. The
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; the National Institutes of Health;
and the Department of Defense began to grant to selected universities the rights
to patent inventions resulting from their funded research. But these rights were
often negotiated and the seeming bureaucracy that this created frustrated many,
including then Senator Robert Dole who commented “rarely have we witnessed a
more hideous example of over management by the bureaucracy.”
Congress enacted the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 largely to address this problem,
and to accelerate the commercialization of federally-funded research at
universities that yielded promising new technologies When it came into law,
Bayh-Dole had the practical effect of standardizing patenting rules for universities
and small businesses, something that previous conflicting laws had not done.
The federal government was off the hook and the universities were given the
opportunity and obligation to commercialize innovations resulting from federal
funding. Policy makers had endorsed technology transfer activities and the last
remaining campuses without explicit technology transfer functions began to
change. Up to that point, universities had seen public engagement in technology
transfer as politically and economically risky, and in most cases, irrelevant to
their core missions. It was not clear that the public supported closer ties between
universities and industry. While the debate on the polluting of science norms, a
common concern with anti-commercialization critics, was well established and
would continue, Bayh-Dole seemingly gave universities no choice but to engage

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 6

<-----Page 6----->in the transfer of inventions to the market (Sampat 2006; Rogers, Yin, and
Hoffmann 2000).
Other trends or forces that were prevalent or emerging around and after the
passage of Bayh-Dole helped establish technology transfer as a primary part of
many university missions (Mowery et al. 2001), at a time when public support for
universities began to decline (Feller 2004). It is understandable, therefore, that
many universities began to look to technology transfer – and the offices that were
in charge of it, the TTOs – as new potential sources of revenue. Indeed,
championing commercialization came to be viewed almost as a core university
activity on some campuses.
It should be clear, however, that the development and growing importance of
TTOs that followed Bayh-Dole were not the stated goals of the legislation. TTOs
instead were the product of that legislation—more than likely the unintended
consequence of the act.

IV. Today’s Technology Transfer “System”
While there is evidence that some investments made in basic research at
universities have been successfully commercialized through the technology
transfer process, there is a plausible if not convincing case to be made that the
results could be better. Commercialization of university research (whether judged
by numbers of patents, licensing of revenue, or new companies formed), remains
differentially successful and largely concentrated in just a handful of universities
(Rogers, Yin, and Hoffmann 2000). This is not an outcome one would expect
from a nation rich in scientific talent at many universities.
Insert Figure 9 about here.
Ironically, this outcome nonetheless is one product of the prevailing model of
commercialization activities that took root in the 1980s. Many universities have
used the TTO to centralize all their invention and commercialization activities,
requiring all university faculty members to work through these offices. In addition,
many university administrations often have rewarded TTO offices and their
personnel based on the revenues they generate rather than on the volume of the
inventions the universities commercialize. We label this current system the
revenue maximization model of technology transfer, even though there is some
evidence to suggest that universities structure their TTO operations only to
maximize revenues in the short term. 1

In considering longer-term financial returns to universities from licensing for cash vs. other forms
of equity arrangements, at lease one group of researchers has shown equity to outpace cash
arrangements Michael J. Bray and James N. Lee, "University Revenues from Technology
Transfer: Licensing Fees Vs. Equity Positions," Journal of Business Venturing 15, no. 5-6 (2000).
Full consideration of the short- vs. long-term theoretical effects of different university technology

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 7

<-----Page 7----->We believe that there are several flaws in the revenue maximization model of
university technology transfer. For one thing, the current reward structure and the
centralization that accompanies it have turned TTOs into monopoly gatekeepers.
Like any monopoly, this means that TTOs do not have incentives to maximize
“output” – or the actual numbers of commercialized innovations – but instead to
maximize only revenues earned by the university. This, in turn, leads to a “home
run” mentality, whereby TTO officers focus their limited time and resources on
the technologies that appear to promise the biggest, fastest payback.
Technologies that might have longer-term potential—or that might be highly
useful for society as a whole, even if they return little or nothing in the way of
licensing fees (such as many “research tools” used mainly by other
researchers)—tend to pile up in the queue, get short shrift, or be overlooked
entirely.
How predominant is the revenue maximization model among TTOs? Markman et
al. found that the principle mechanism favored by most TTOs was licensing for
cash (72 percent), with licensing for an equity stake and sponsored research less
popular at 17 percent and 11 percent, respectively. These interview-based
findings were confirmed by the researchers in a review of TTO mission
statements which showed a heavy focus on licensing and protection of the
university’s intellectual property (Markman et al. 2005b) and are consistent with
other research in this area (Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby 2001).
Insert Table 2 about here.
With revenue maximization as a central goal, it also is not surprising that most
depictions of technology transfer activities are portrayed as very linear processes
in which research is performed, inventions are disclosed, technology licenses are
executed, income is received, and wealth is generated (Siegel et al. 2004).
Insert Figure 10 about here.
But the process of technology transfer actually is much more complex. Patenting
and licensing of research are not the only means—or even the most important
means —of “transferring” new knowledge from universities to the market.
Universities have a range of outputs including information, materials, equipment
and instruments, human capital, networks, and prototypes (Siegel et al. 2004).
The means by which these outputs are diffused, especially to industry, vary
across universities (Sampat 2006). The Carnegie Mellon Survey of Industrial
R&D found that the most commonly reported mechanisms for diffusion of public
research to industry were publications, conferences, and informal exchanges.
Patents ranked low in most industries except for pharmaceuticals (Cohen,
Nelson, and Walsh 2002). Measuring university success in spawning innovation
transfer mechanisms remains an area open for future research, particularly when societal
measures for benefit are taken into consideration in terms of diffusion of innovation within the
marketplace and other similar issues.

Page 8

<-----Page 8----->solely by licensing or patenting activities, therefore, almost certainly masks the
importance of these other means of knowledge diffusion.
There are other means by which universities diffuse their technologies to the
market: through non-patent innovations, start-up companies launched by
university faculty or related parties, and consulting engagements between
industry and faculty. One recent study, for example, indicated that approximately
29 percent of patents with public university faculty inventors were assigned to
firms rather than the university (Thursby and Thursby 2005a), which indicates a
significant degree of faculty-industry engagement, whether formally through
TTOs or informally through other pathways (Siegel et al. 2004).
Meanwhile, university faculty members are learning ways to maximize their own
self-interest within a general environment that impels TTOs to maximize revenue.
In particular, and not surprisingly, faculty engaged in commercialization activities
are becoming more competent in the field. One measure of this is the significant
increase in disclosure rates over time by faculty, perhaps the best indicator of
university-based technology transfer at the faculty level (Thursby and Thursby
2003).
Insert Figure 11 about here.
Still, university commercialization activity remains highly concentrated within the
university itself—seemingly obeying the widely accepted “80/20” rule, with
somewhat less than 20 percent of university faculty ever having engaged in
patent disclosure of any kind (Thursby and Thursby 2003). Further, there is a
trend toward greater university ownership of research and commercialization,
reflected in the significant increases in university patenting (Coupe 2003),
increased contributions to R&D spending, 2 and the proliferation of university
spin-offs and research parks (Mowery et al. 2004). University spin-offs, in this
context, are defined as “firms founded on a contractual agreement, such as an
option of a license, regarding intellectual property for which the university
maintains title” (Lowe 2002). Some spin-offs reside in incubators near campuses
but this is not always the case.
Spin-offs pursue paths and opportunities that larger, more established
companies shun or ignore. Of the inventions licensed in the previous five years,
TTOs reported that 45 percent were at the proof of concept stage, 37 percent
were lab scale prototypes, 15 percent were manufacturing-ready technologies,
and 12 percent were market-ready inventions (Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby
2001). Another survey of 62 universities found that new and small companies
tend to license early stage technologies that are passed over by large firms
(Thursby, Jensen, and Thursby 2001). With venture capital firms moving toward
2

In 2000, 19 percent of the R&D performed on university campuses was university funded, up
from 10 percent in 1960 (National Science Foundation 2006).

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 9

<-----Page 9----->later stage investments (PricewaterhouseCoopers and National Venture Capital
Association 2007), the role of universities in nurturing early stage start-ups may
be increasing in importance.
While spin-offs from universities are few in number, they are disproportionately
high performing companies, and often serve as a mechanism to bridge the
development gap between university technology and existing private sector
products and services. A quick look at the data confirms this point. Although only
3,376 academic spin-off companies were created in the United States from 1980
to 2000, fully 68 percent of these companies remained operational in 2001
(Association of University Technology Managers 2002). One study has estimated
that 8 percent of all university spin-offs had gone public, 114 times the “going
public rate” for U.S. enterprises generally (Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003). As
impressive as these figures are, they understate the extent of university-based
entrepreneurship since they do not include start-up companies represented in
business plan competitions, back-door entrepreneurial activities emerging out of
faculty consulting, and general spillovers from graduate students creating
companies tied to outcomes of university research.
One other important measure of technology transfer is the time between
discovery and commercialization. Accelerating the pace of commercialization
provides more benefit to both the university (quicker return to R&D) and the
commercializing agent (more flexibility with time in terms of testing or bringing to
market) (Markman et al. 2005a). In reviewing the commercialization time of
patented protected inventions in 91 universities, Markman et al (2005a) found
that speed had a positive effect on licensing income or start-up creation
(Markman et al. 2005a). Still, even in this study, the average commercialization
speed – from discovery to licensing or spin-off – was just over four years.
We believe there must be a better way of commercializing university inventions.
Commercialization policies can and must be structured to realize the social
benefits of a wider number of innovations. The question is how, and it is to this
subject that we next turn.

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 10

<-----Page 10----->V. Proposed Models of University Commercialization
Universities commercialize the innovations developed by their faculty largely by
licensing the intellectual property in these breakthroughs (typically patents) to
entrepreneurs, to the faculty members themselves, or to established companies.
Historically, university faculty and students have generated a range of
innovations that have found their way into the market and have helped launch
new companies. The Internet browser (Netscape), Internet search engine
(Google), and various biotechnologies (Genentech) are just a few examples
(Association of American Universities 1998). There are, however, strong
reasons to believe that the objectives of Bayh-Dole could be met even more
effectively.
During the 1980s and 1990s, most universities had little experience negotiating
with industry and considering commercialization activities. With time and
experience, however, universities and, more importantly, faculty have gained
expertise in the invention and innovation processes. As individual university
cultures and disciplinary practices have evolved, some universities have begun
to recognize that commercialization and innovation activities are larger than what
can run through a single office and require cross-university programmatic
initiatives in the classroom and the laboratory. Examples of universities that
have moved in this direction include MIT, the University of Arizona, and the
University of California, Berkeley. As these new forms emerge, or more
accurately, as TTOs become just one component of the innovation and
commercialization ecosystem, technology transfer will increase in efficiency,
volume, and quality on most college campuses.
In his classic work, Diffusion of Innovations, Rogers delineates two models of
technology diffusion systems: “Centralized diffusion systems are based on a
more linear, one-way model of communication. Decentralized diffusion systems
more closely follow a convergence model of communication, in which participants
create and share information with one another in order to reach mutual
understanding” (Rogers 2003). If this distinction is right, and we believe it is,
then a change in the practice of innovation and commercialization will not be
achieved simply by creating a single, central office. Instead, technology will be
best diffused by recognizing and taking advantage of the decentralized nature of
innovation and university faculty who participate in this process.
It is also important to take account of the importance of work environment and
culture on entrepreneurial activity among faculty. The shrinking gap in disclosure
and other entrepreneurial activities by women, for example, is evidence that
incremental changes in culture and practice can have important effects (Thursby
and Thursby 2005b). Bercovitz and Feldman also found strong evidence for the
impact of the micro-level work environment on faculty patterns of invention
disclosure in a study of a group of matched faculty at two prominent medical

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 11

<-----Page 11----->schools. In this study, disclosure increased when a faculty member was at an
institution with a tradition of disclosure, observed others in a department
disclosing, and worked in a department with a chair who actively disclosed. The
authors also found evidence that the institutional norms where academics
completed their training influenced future technology transfer proclivity, but they
determined that individuals ultimately were most likely to alter their activities to
conform to local norms (Bercovitz and Feldman 2006).
Not only do research faculty members appear to have a profound influence on
the innovation and commercialization of other academic researchers at their
universities, but also these individuals are the key agents of knowledge transfer
(Markman et al. 2005a). Many technologies licensed from universities are
nascent in their development and much of the value in the innovation lies in the
tacit knowledge of their inventors (Jensen and Thursby 2001). Faculty members
also tend to become more attuned to the potential for application and
commercialization of their research over time. Experience with invention and
commercialization, as well as consulting, advisory board service, industrysponsored research, and formal commercialization activities, allow faculty
members to become more familiar with the process and affect the direction of
their future research (Mansfield 1995).
Given the importance of faculty researchers to innovation and commercialization,
a university culture that is accepting of entrepreneurial activities is best built from
the ground up by researchers who promote and connect other colleagues both
inside and outside of academe. But how can universities promote the
development of entrepreneurial capabilities in their faculty? The answer does not
lie, in our view, in expanding the role for TTOs. Many research faculty members
are likely to have better opportunity recognition skills – both scientific and
entrepreneurial – than TTO professionals. After all, academic researchers have
spent years working in their fields, and they have incentives within their
disciplines to recognize avenues for scientific advances and breakthroughs.
Furthermore, researchers’ “social capital” – their professional relationships with
their peers inside and outside the academy – give them a greater ability to link
scientific opportunity recognition to entrepreneurial opportunity recognition.
To be sure, these opportunity recognition skills – particularly for commercial
opportunities – take time to develop. One does not expect to achieve cultural
transformation overnight. Many university campuses have experienced a
gradual cultural change since the passage of Bayh-Dole, and they now face the
challenge of defining multiple pathways to support university innovation and
commercialization and redefining the role of TTOs.
It has been suggested that TTOs should reorganize in ways that would reduce
the potentially significant “transactions costs” involved in moving scientific
discoveries more rapidly into the marketplace. These costs include tangible and
intangible expenses related to the identification, protection, and modification of

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 12

<-----Page 12----->innovation and commercialization, as well as the administrative expenses and
the opportunity costs for the time that would be required by researchers. To
reduce these costs, it has been suggested that TTOs adopt something like a
“value chain” model (Phan and Siegel 2006) that encourages universities to
disaggregate their functions, slicing and dicing a range of what are considered to
be technology transfer functions and assigning them to specialists, while
leveraging outside organizations and other partners in the process.
We build on this basic concept, recognizing both the comparative advantage of
faculty in opportunity recognition and the limited budgets of university
administration. In particular, we believe universities must recognize that
patenting is only one of many pathways from innovation to marketplace. We
argue, therefore, for a change in the objective of technology commercialization
and in the “model” of the commercialization process. Specifically, we suggest a
move from a “licensing model” that seeks to maximize patent licensing income to
a “volume model” that emphasizes the number of university innovations and the
speed with which they are moved into the marketplace.
In fact, there are multiple volume models, but they share several features:


They provide rewards for moving innovations into the marketplace, rather
than simply counting the revenue they may return;



They focus on faculty as the key agents of innovation and
commercialization; and



They emphasize further standardization in the interactions of campuses
with their faculty and with industry.

Below we consider four variations of the “volume” model and discuss their
advantages and drawbacks.
Free Agency: The first volume model is “free agency,” a term we borrow from
the sports world. Under this approach, faculty members are given the power to
choose a third party (or themselves) to negotiate license arrangements for
entrepreneurial activities, provided that they return some portion of their profits to
the university. The TTOs can be one of the third parties offering services, but
other parties can also compete on a range of services and experience offered.
The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) is an exemplar of such a
model. WARF is independent of the university, and Wisconsin faculty are under
no obligation to use it except in the case of federal funding. As a practical
matter, however, nearly all of them use WARF because the organization has
acquired expertise over time that is viewed to be valuable.

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

Page 13

<-----Page 13----->Free agency introduces a strong dose of competition to the university TTO, while
giving academic researchers the freedom to seek out the best arrangement on
the speediest terms to commercialize their innovation. This model is best suited
for innovations in which faculty members have deep commercial expertise and
social networks to facilitate commercialization.
One drawback to free agency, however, is that university faculty members often
lack the resources to pay for patent searches and applications, functions now
performed by the TTO. This problem might be overcome through profit sharing
arrangements between researchers and their lawyers or third-party
commercialization agents.
Faculty members also could license their inventions to third parties who, as part
of the agreement, would bear the patent-related costs. This free-agent model
requires further consideration in order to determine if it is consistent with existing
legislation and to evaluate the degree to which regulation to overcome
information barriers would be necessary.
Regional Alliances: A second possible model provides more technology
transfer activities via regional alliances, provided those alliances operate in ways
to maximize volume rather than licensing income. Under this approach, multiple
universities form consortia that develop their mechanisms for commercialization.
Economies of scale allow for lower costs of the commercialization functions
overall, and the universities are able to share these costs among the multiple
participants.
This model may prove particularly attractive for smaller research universities
which may not have the volume to support a seasoned and highly able licensing
and commercialization staff independently. WARF, through the WiSys
Technology Foundation, is experimenting with more of a regional approach to
technology transfer and has had positive results so far. This type of hub-andspoke model is effective when supported by experienced staff and dedicated
local resources.
There are two principal concerns with the regional alliances model, however.
First, a regional TTO with insufficient resources may try to behave like a “super
TTO,” seeking to maximize licensing revenue for the consortium as a whole
rather than the number of commercialization opportunities and the speed with
which they are moved out the door.
Additionally, regional models may face coordination challenges or disputes over
attribution of inventiveness, with one or more universities pitted against others
when a commercial opportunity is realized through the joint work of several
researchers at different universities. The probability of disputes is likely related to
the amount of money at stake.

Page 14

<-----Page 14----->Internet-based Approaches: Closely related to the regional alliance model,
Internet-based approaches use the web to facilitate commercialization. Given
their structure, internet “matchmaking” approaches – which seek to match those
who have ideas and those who want to implement them – are inherently built to
maximize volume rather than licensing income.
An example of an Internet-based approach is www.ibridgenetwork.com, a Webbased platform launched in January 2007 and operated by the Kauffman
Innovation Network, Inc. and funded by the Kauffman Foundation. Universities
joining the iBridgeSM Network are able to post information about their innovations
directly to the site, which provides an alternative pathway to research tools,
materials, and non-exclusive licensed technologies that should accelerate
university innovation and lower transaction costs. Its success remains to be
seen, but initial Web traffic suggests that the program has had an auspicious
start.
Faculty Loyalty: The last – and perhaps the most radical – model for many
universities to consider is for universities to give up their intellectual property
rights, anticipating instead that loyal faculty will donate some of the fruits of their
success back to the university. While surrendering rights to faculty may seem
drastic, this strategy offers the ultimate incentive for the external agents of
commercialization to engage in the process.
In fact, the United States has a great tradition of philanthropy, and this model
allows university administration to focus on the core activities of a university while
securing additional university operational dollars through the virtuous cycle of
giving. There is a history of successful faculty members donating some of their
profits back to the university. Jan T. Vilcek, for example, pledged $105 million to
the New York University School of Medicine in 2005, largely as the result of
royalties earned from Remicade®, a drug invented by Dr. Vilcek and a colleague
while working at the school’s Department of Microbiology (New York University
Medical Center 2005). Other examples abound including George Hatsopoulos
and MIT (MIT 2005) or Jim Clark and Stanford (Stanford University 1999).
The obvious downside to the “loyalty” model is the inherent – and significant –
risk. There is always the possibility that successful academic entrepreneurs will
not voluntarily share their success with their employers. This risk is even greater
for universities that have difficult relationships with their faculty.
We believe, however, that this risk is worth taking for most universities.
Academics pursue their work in large part because they have a thirst for
knowledge and discovery. While they may also be motivated by money, most
faculty members are determined to move commercially viable innovations to the
market. And as monetarily successful professors give back to their universities,
they set positive examples for their colleagues to follow. Furthermore, the
“loyalty” model avoids the haggles associated with Intellectual Property (IP) rights

inventions than either of the other two models. And it should entail very low risks
for well-run universities that promote collegiality.

VI. Discussion and Conclusion
“When you ask ‘Where are tomorrow's ideas?’ they are things you and I would
look at and say, ‘That's not going anywhere. That's worthless.’ ”
- William R. Brody, president of Johns Hopkins University
(in Holstein 2006)
U.S. universities today are not only competing with other U.S. institutions for
collaborative relationships with industry, they are both collaborating and
competing within a global economy. Our institutions must continue to be leaders
in research, the advancement of innovation, and the commercialization of our
ideas in order to remain competitive.
The majority of university-industry agreements relate to technologies that are
many years away from being commercialized (Jensen and Thursby 2001), and
universities cannot take on the burden of forecasting uncertain commercial
returns. This function is best performed by the private sector. In the end, society
will be best served by a knowledge transfer system that encourages interactions
between universities and industry but also inspires each party to capitalize on its
relative advantage – with universities focusing on discovery and entrepreneurs
devoting their efforts to commercialization.
This discussion of how innovations are transferred from universities to industry is
an important part of the national conversation about U.S. economic
competitiveness. We are now at a critical time in which the incentives of some
universities (or specific officials within the universities) may lead to the
codification of a system that would inhibit rather than promote commercialization
of technological breakthroughs. We have argued that the most important way to
avoid this outcome is to refocus university administration away from the historic
“patent-licensing big hit” model to one or more “volume models” that concentrate
on the number of and the speed with which university innovations are sent out
the door and into the marketplace. These models will include open source
collaborations, copyright, non-exclusive licensing, and a focus on developing the
social networks for graduate students and faculty to commercialize all types of
innovations.
The federal government, as the funding source for university-based research, is
in an ideal position to encourage experimentation with these—and other—
alternative arrangements. At a minimum, the government can help educate
universities regarding the importance of providing a more fluid environment that
will allow for more rapid commercialization of ideas developed by students and

Commercializing Innovations: A Better Way

<-----Page 16----->faculty. More ambitiously, agencies of the federal government can condition their
research grants on university demonstrations that they are experimenting with
and using multiple pathways to provide competition or to advance innovations
into the commercial market.
