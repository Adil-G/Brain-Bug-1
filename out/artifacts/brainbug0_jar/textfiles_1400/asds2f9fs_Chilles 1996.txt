INTEGRATING VARIABLE RISK PREFERENCES, 

TRUST, AND TRANSACTION COST ECONOMICS 

TODD H. CHILES 


JOHN F. MCMACKIN 

University of Oregon 

Transaction cost economics (TCE) relies on three behavioral assumptions in predicting how firms choose governance structuresbounded rationality. opportunism, and risk neutrality. We explore the
implications of the neglected behavioral assumption of risk neutrality. offer an integrative appraisal of the three behavioral assumptions
using trust a s a unifying perspective. and explicate subjective costs
and risks. We illustrate the relative ease with which previous empirical shortcomings can be addressed by incorporating risk and trust in
TCE models.

Why do firms decide to integrate vertically or to contract in the market? Do the integration decisions of firms have any bearing on whether
they survive a n d prosper? Transaction cost economics (TCE)h a s made a n
important contribution to management researchers' understanding of
these central questions of the economics of the firm. Despite the importance of its contributions, some fundamental questions about TCE as a
theory remain unanswered. Does TCE merely describe firm behaviors, or
does it prescribe what managers should do to ensure survival andlor
prosperity? What time frame does the theory address? Is it concerned
mostly with individual firm behaviors, or does the theory predict market
behaviors? What is the role of risk a n d trust in the model? And does
empirical evidence, which shows that two firms faced with similar transaction costs choose different levels of integration, challenge the validity
of the theory? This article addresses all of these questions.
TCE, which h a s experienced a revitalization during the past 20 years,
most notably in the work of Williamson (1975, 1985), is a synthesis of
economics, law, a n d organizational theory. In essence, Williamson proposed that if theorists can ascertain the level of asset specificity for a
transaction, the frequency of interaction between the parties to it a n d the
degree of uncertainty surrounding it, they can predict the governance

structure that will be adopted by the parties to the transaction. Underlying this rationale is the central premise that the chosen governance structure will be the one that minimizes transaction costs. Of the three attributes of the transaction, asset specificity h a s occupied center stage. Asset
specificity refers to the extent to which assets (e.g., physical, human, or
locational) a r e specialized to a specific transaction a n d can be used only
a t lower value in alternative applications. An example of physical asset
specificity is the significant investment made by a n automobile parts
supplier (e.g., Fisher Body in the 1920s)in stamping equipment a n d molds
for automobile bodies that are specialized to the needs of a particular
auto manufacturer (e.g., GM in the 1920s)a n d that have little or no value
to other firms (Klein, Crawford, & Alchian, 1978). TCE's contribution lies in
the ability its user h a s to predict the governance structure (market, hybrid,
or hierarchy) as a function of the attributes of the transaction. As a n
example of governance structure, a n automobile manufacturer that is
building a new assembly plant must decide whether to purchase the parts
it needs in the marketplace (market), to manufacture them in house (hierarchy), or to enter into some intermediate form of relationship with
suppliers (hybrid); Williamson (1991) described as hybrid those intermediate forms that lie on the continuum between market a n d hierarchy. In
sum, TCE focuses attention on the attributes of the transaction, with economizing on transaction costs viewed as the main purpose of economic
institutions. The theory also relies on three behavioral assumptions in
predicting how firms choose governance structures-opportunism,
bounded rationality a n d risk neutrality (Williamson, 1985).
The predictive validity of the theory has, however, been somewhat
undermined by empirical evidence that firms can coexist for extended
periods with structures that a r e apparently "anomalous" (Robins, 1987:
81). A good example of such a n anomaly can be found in the 1982 study by
Monteverde a n d Teece, who measured asset specificity as the degree of
"specialized, non-patentable know-how" (1982: 206) in the production of
parts in the U.S. automobile industry. Their finding that GM a n d Ford a r e
more likely to vertically integrate a t higher levels of asset specificity h a s
been widely acclaimed as providing empirical support for the TCE paradigm.' Less satisfactory, from this new institutional economics perspective, i s the failure of the theory to predict the significant difference in the
level of integration between GM a n d Ford in the same study. To date,
transaction cost theorists have been notably silent in the face of such
anomalies; others, however, have been more forthcoming. For instance,

'

We focus on vertical integration because, a s Williamson put it: "Vertical integration is
not only an important condition in its own right but equally because the transaction cost
treatment of the decision to integrate is paradigmatic" (1985: 13). We suggest. however, that
the arguments offered here also may extend to other issues in the TCE literature, such a s
employment relations and corporate governance.

Robins (1987) used such findings to support his argument that TCE h a s
much more limited scope as a theoretical framework than its proponents
would advocate. Thus, such empirical shortcomings, if they remain unexplained, may have far-reaching consequences for TCE.
As the primary contribution of this article, we propose that these
apparent limitations of the theory a r e partly a result of the neglect of the
third behavioral assumption of TCE, that of risk neutrality (Williamson,
1985). Although the other behavioral assumptions in the modelopportunism a n d bounded rationality-have been closely scrutinized,
the assumption of risk neutrality h a s gone virtually unnoticed. The adoption of this assumption h a s focused the attention of TCE scholars away
from the variable risk preferences of transactors. In this article, we use
Williamson's (1991) framework to illustrate that incorporating a range of
risk preferences (from risk aversion, through risk neutrality, to risk seeking) into the model can help resolve, within the TCE paradigm, many of
the apparent contradictions encountered in earlier empirical research.
Furthermore, we propose that isolated treatment of the individual
behavioral assumptions of TCE is rendered futile by the interactive nature of bounded rationality, opportunism, a n d risk neutrality. The important links among these three variables have not been comprehensively
appraised. We also undertake what we believe is the first comprehensive
a n d integrative appraisal of these three assumptions. We propose that
the social context variable of trust provides a unifying perspective with
which to undertake this task.
Finally, we render explicit the important issue of the treatment of
economic costs in TCE. We argue that much of the logic of mainstream
TCE, including the work of Williamson, ultimately relies on a n important
but unstated view of economic costs as subjective, a perspective generally associated with the Austrian school of economics. We explore the
implications of this subjectivist interpretation of costs a n d compare a n d
contrast this work with another stream of research within the TCE paradigm in which costs a r e viewed as objective. In general, we propose that
not only can previous inconsistencies in TCE begin to be reconciled when
assumptions about costs a r e rendered explicit, but that different, complementary research streams can readily coexist within the TCE paradigm.
In sum, we examine the implications of relaxing the assumptions of
risk neutrality, opportunism, a n d bounded rationality in the TCE model.
Such a relaxation is in keeping with a deductive theorizing approach, in
which assumptions that a r e initially less realistic are relaxed over time,
in order to bring greater realism to the model (Camerer, 1985). In essence,
we take two commonsense ideas that have been supported by empirical
research-that managers have variable risk preferences a n d that trust
a n d risk a r e mutually interdependent-and show how they can be incorporated in the TCE model in a way that enhances the predictive validity
of the theory. We hope not only to improve the theory but also to move TCE
a step closer to being directly useful to managers.

THE TREATMENT OF COSTS IN TRANSACTION COST ECONOMICS
Since its revitalization by Williamson, there h a s been some debate
over the place of TCE in the body of economic theory (e.g., Hill, 1990;
Robins, 1987). We propose that there are, in fact, two separate streams of
research within TCE, in which research agendas are driven by contrasting views of what i s meant by economic costs. These alternative perspectives on costs have led researchers to address different levels of analysis,
time frames, a n d dependent variables. For purposes of this discussion,
we label the two streams as economic natural selection, which h a s been
adopted by evolutionary theorists, a n d managerial choice, which h a s
been adopted by decision theorists.
The economic natural-selection approach of the evolutionary theorists adopts the population of organizations as the level of analysis, the
environment as the primary selection mechanism that utilizes some selection criteria (e.g., transaction cost economizing), the long run as the
appropriate time frame, a n d a n ex post objective view of costs. The economic natural selection approach h a s been adopted by Alchian (1950)a n d
Nelson a n d Winter (19821, generally, a n d by Ulrich a n d Barney (1984)a n d
Hi11 (1990) with respect to TCE. Ulrich a n d Barney (1984) argued that population ecology could be treated as a meta-theory, in which transaction
cost efficiency represented one possible first-order selection mechanism.
From a TCE perspective, Hill argued that "in the long-run, the invisible
hand selects actors whose behaviors a r e biased toward cooperation"
(1990: 501). In this framework, organizations that have adopted governance structures that economize on transaction costs are selected by the
invisible hand of the market a n d survive in the long run, regardless of
whether the choice of such governance structures w a s based on transaction-cost-economizing decisions, resource-dependence decisions, imitation of other firms, luck, or any variety of other reasons; those that have
not chosen efficient governance structures a r e deselected a n d fail. Thus,
TCE is a theory about what governance structures we would observe
among a population of organizations at the end of a lengthy evolutionary
process, in which the economic system reaches the competitive equilibrium. From this perspective, the "anomalous" coexistence of firms that
adopt differing governance structures is consistent with TCE because in
the short run, disequilibrium prevails, a n d both efficient a n d inefficient
forms will be observed to c o e x i ~ t . ~
The second major body of theory a n d research in TCE can be described as the managerial-choice approach. This approach to TCE h a s
been adopted by Williamson (1975, 1985) a n d Walker a n d Weber (1984),
who assumed that managers utilize a transaction-cost-economizing calculus in making contracting decisions. In this view, TCE is a theory about

the choice of governance structures made by managers faced with given
levels of asset specificity, uncertainty, a n d frequency of interaction. In
this article, w e seek to build on this body of work. Our arguments provide
support for TCE as a theory of managerial decision making by showing
that when risk a n d trust a r e included in the model, TCE offers a viable
explanation for previously confounding empirical evidence.
We propose that the important differences between the evolutionary
theorists a n d the decision theorists a r e rooted in different assumptions
about economic costs.3 The managerial-choice approach to TCE relies on
a n implicit view of costs as subjective. The concept of subjective costs
comes from the Austrian school of economics (e.g., Kirzner, 1986; Pasour,
1991; Vaughn, 1980)-a branch of economics concerned with individualchoice a n d disequilibrium-market processes. Economic costs a r e inherently subjective, because different decision makers sacrifice different alternatives at the moment of choice based on different perceptions of a n d
preferences for the alternative opportunities in a world of uncertainty.
Pasour provided a n illustrative example of the subjective nature of
costs: "Consider the cost to be imputed to (say) land in producing corn.
The cost of land in corn is the value of opportunities foregone by using
land for corn instead of using land in its best alternative use. Cost by its
very nature, however, involves choice, a n d choice cannot be predetermined a n d still remain choice. The cost of similar land in corn may well
be quite different for Jones a n d Smith. Jones, for example, may anticipate
a return to land of $30 per acre when using the land for soybeans (the best
alternative use). Smith, on the other hand, being more optimistic about
future soybean yields or prices, may anticipate a return of $50 per acre for
Jones a n d $50 per acre for Smith, even though Jones a n d Smith pay the
same rental price for land" (1991: 283). In this case, the cost of land as it
influences entrepreneurial choice is inherently subjective. One can now
begin to understand why Jones may choose to plant corn (or GM to build
parts in house) a n d Smith soybeans (or Ford to subcontract parts), even
though conventional accounting records might show the same objective
cost for each farmer (or automobile firm).
By contrast with the subjective view of costs implicit in the managerial-choice approach, we suggest that the natural-selection approach to
TCE relies on a n assumption of costs as objective. Thus, in the managerial-choice view, the relevant costs a r e those that influence choice,
whereas in the natural-selection approach the relevant costs a r e those
that result from choice. In the managerial-choice approach, costs involve
a n ex ante evaluation of future outcomes, whereas, in the economicnatural-selection approach, costs involve a n ex post evaluation of past
In particular, economic costs a r e defined a s opportunity costs or the costs of sacrificed
alternatives by the decision maker. "This particular concept of costs would seem to be the
only one which is of use in the solution of business problems, since it concentrates attention
on the alternative courses of action which a r e open to the businessman" (Coase, 1973: 108).

outcomes. It is only in general equilibrium that subjective costs will
equate directly to objective costs, measured using accounting records
(Vaughn, 1980).
These differing views of cost provide insight on a n d reveal the complementarity of the two streams of research in TCE. For example, a governance structure chosen under the uncertainty of disequilibrium to economize on subjective transaction costs at the moment of choice may be
judged in error, as having failed to economize on objective transaction
costs, when assessed ex post by a n outside observer. Hence, from the
distant, ex-post equilibrium perspective of a n outside observer, such failures to economize on transaction costs result not in a n "optimal level of
integration" as TCE would predict, but rather in a "preferred level of
integration." However, from a n up-close, ex ante disequilibrium perspective of a n actual decision maker, this choice of governance structure may
have, in fact, been based on a transaction-cost-economizing rationalethe best transaction-cost-economizing decision that could be made, given
the uncertainty of the moment, hence, resulting in a n optimal level of
integration as understood a t the moment of choice.
In general, the evolutionary theorists view costs as objective a n d
focus their attention on a different research domain from the decision
theorists. Evolutionary theorists consider a long-run time frame, in which
the market, or population of organizations, is the level of analysis. Because it is the relative economic performance of firms that determines
their selection for survival or death, the dependent variable of interest is
economic performance. The evolutionary approach is not the primary focus of TCE, according to Williamson, although he acknowledged that "the
argument relies in a general, background way on the efficacy of competition to perform a sort between more a n d less efficient modes a n d to shift
resources in favor of the former . . . The intuition would nevertheless
benefit from a more fully developed theory of the selection process" (1985:
22-23).
TCE's decision theorists consider a world in which managers choose
governance structures in accordance with a subjective interpretation of
transaction costs. As such, the level of analysis is the individual firm, the
time frame is relatively short run, a n d the empirical research focuses on
the behaviors of a single firm or a few firms (Monteverde & Teece, 1982;
Walker & Weber, 1984). The managerial-choice approach to TCE is, we
would suggest, the primary focus of the theory. This is reflected throughout the work of Williamson a n d is also consistent with the work of Coase,
who stated, "There is no one decision which can be considered to maximize profits independently of the attitude of risk-taking of the businessman. A further point is that the correctness of the decision cannot be
determined by subsequent events" (1973: 104-105). The importance of understanding managerial decisions is also explicitly recognized by the
evolutionary theorists, as reflected in Alchian: "The precise role a n d na-

<-----Page 7----->1996

ture of purposive behavior in the presence of uncertainty a n d incomplete
information have not been clearly understood or analyzed" (1950: 221).
In sum, this article fits solidly into a stream of literature whose authors have viewed costs as subjective a n d TCE as a theory of managerial
choice. We provide a strong rationale for our interpretation, which is
grounded in the mainstream TCE literature of Williamson (1975, 1985) a n d
Walker a n d Weber (1984) as well as the work of Coase. Furthermore, we
argue that development of the TCE paradigm will be enhanced by more
explicit recognition of the differing views of costs that underlie the evolutionary- a n d decision-theoretic applications of the theory. Although our
analysis reflects our belief that the subjective view of costs h a s greater
validity, we recognize that parallel research based on the objective view
of costs is to a large extent complementary a n d entirely consistent with
the foundations of the theory.

THE TREATMENT OF RISK IN TRANSACTION COST ECONOMICS
The behavioral assumption of risk neutrality h a s received but sparse
attention in the TCE literature to date. Williamson defended his own
cursory treatment of the issue (which is relegated to the concluding section of his 1985 book) on the grounds that the focus of TCE is "on the
attributes of transactions rather than the risk attitudes of transactors"
(1985: 389).4 By adopting the simplifying assumption that all transactors
a r e neutral in their attitudes to risk, Williamson argued, attention is
firmly focused on the transaction as the unit of analysis. A striking contrast can be observed in the TCE literature between the limited attention
afforded the assumption of risk neutrality a n d the more direct focus on the
behavioral assumptions of bounded rationality a n d opportunism (Hill,
1990; Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992; Williamson, 1985). We suggest that there
a r e three important reasons why a closer examination of risk neutrality is
called for. First, it differs from the risk-aversion assumption of neoclassical economics. Given that "transaction cost analysis relies on a n implicit analogy to neoclassical economics" (Robins, 1987: 70), a n explicit
Two other defenses for adopting the assumption of risk neutrality a r e offered by
Williamson (1985: 389-390). First, he suggested that a n assumption of risk neutrality approximates reality and is acceptable when the theory is applied to intermediate product
markets wherein owners (not managers) make the governance-structure decisions of their
firms. We argue that not only does this impose severe, and ultimately unnecessary, limitations on the application of the theory, but that it is at odds with empirical research in
agency theory on the role played by owners in firms' decision-making processes (Eisenhardt,
1989). The third defense, described by Williamson a s the "most compelling" (1985: 389). is
that a risk-neutrality assumption focuses attention on "core efficiency features" (Williamson, 1985: 389) of organizations that a r e obscured when behavioral assumptions are relaxed.
We illustrate in this article that the important insights offered by TCE on these efficiency
features can b e illuminated by relaxing the behavioral assumption of risk neutrality.

<-----Page 8----->80

treatment of the differences in the behavioral assumptions of the two
models is a prerequisite for any comparison between them. Second, as
discussed next, psychological studies of risk taking in organizational contexts suggest that the assumption of a single risk attitude for a firm may
be inadequate a n d that risk preferences for a single firm vary in a systematic fashion on a spectrum from risk aversion through risk neutrality
to risk seeking, influenced by a variety of contextual variables (March &
Shapira, 1987). Finally, the governance structure predicted by the TCE
model will vary with the risk preference of the firm.
Defining Risk

The task of defining risk has long been fraught with controversy a n d
confusion (Fischoff, Watson, & Hope, 1990). Although classical decision
theory suggests that risk is "the variance of the probability distribution of
possible g a i n s a n d losses associated with a particular alternative"
(March & Shapira, 1987: 14041, organizational researchers suggest that
this is a poor description of how managers view risk (MacCrimmon &
Wehrung, 1986; March & Shapira, 1987). Following MacCrimmon a n d
Wehrung (19861 a n d Yates a n d Stone (19921, we treat risk a s "the possibility of loss" (1992: 41, a definition that more closely reflects the perspectives
of managers in organizations. Importantly, risk is understood as "an inherently subjective construct" (Yates & Stone, 1992: 5), a view also explicitly adopted by MacCrimmon a n d Wehrung (1986). The definition of risk
adopted here is therefore pertinent not only to our treatment of TCE as a
theory of organizational decision making, but also it is consistent with our
view of costs as subjective.
The difference between risk a n d uncertainty is important. As Orbell
put it: "A decision maker confronts risk when he or s h e can attach probabilities to alternative states of the world with confidence; from a fair
pack of playing cards, for example, a gambler can be confident that there
is a 1 in 52 chance of drawing the ace of hearts. A decision maker confronts uncertainty, however, when there is a n unknown number of cards
a n d (or) a n unknown number of aces of hearts in the deck. Under uncertainty, not only can one still lose but one does not know the odds" (1993:
130). For our purposes, this definition distinguishes between risk (the
subjective possibility of loss as perceived by the decision maker) a n d the
notion of uncertainty in TCE, which Williamson described as attributable
to exogenous "disturbances" (1985: 581, the origins of which may be behavioral or environmental.
Defining Risk Preferences

What is the difference between a n assumption of risk aversion a n d a n
assumption of risk neutrality or risk seeking? Because no definition of risk
neutrality is offered in the TCE literature, we assume that the term is

<-----Page 9----->1996

Chiles and McMackin

81

intended to be interpreted as it is defined in the neoclassical economics
literature.
An assumption of risk neutrality suggests that a risk-neutral party is
"indifferent between a prospect of uncertain profits a n d a certain profit,
provided that the expected average of the prospective fluctuating profits
is equal to the certain profit" (Aoki, 1984: 15). These parties therefore have
a linear utility function (Townsend, 1982), which is characterized by constant marginal utility. This assumption can be contrasted with the riskaversion assumption of neoclassical economics that suggests that a party
which is risk averse will always prefer a certain profit to the prospect of
fluctuating profits, provided the expected value of the certain profit is not
less than the expected average of the prospective profits by more than
some positive value. The utility function for risk-averse parties is, therefore, "strictly concave, strictly increasing a n d continuously differentiable" (Townsend, 1982: 1170). The concept of risk aversion is based on
diminishing marginal utility, which "supposes" that the marginal utility
of a n extra dollar in payoffs declines as more dollars are won. In essence,
risk-averse parties will always prefer a certain profit to the prospect of
fluctuating profits, whereas risk-neutral parties will be indifferent between the two, provided that their expected values a r e equal. It should be
noted that Williamson's (1985) discussion of risk neutrality compares it
with a single alternative assumption of risk aversion. In a more complete
conceptualization of the range of possible risk preferences, one must also
consider risk seeking, as suggested by prospect theory (Bromiley, 1991;
Fiegenbaum & Thomas, 1988; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). A party that is
risk seeking will always prefer a fluctuating profit to the prospect of
certain profits, provided the expected average of the fluctuating profit is
greater than the expected value of the certain profit. The utility function
for risk-seeking parties is therefore convex (i.e., concave-up), increasing,
a n d continuously differentiable-properties that are consistent with increasing marginal utility.
Determinants of Risk Preferences

There is a substantial theoretical a n d empirical literature on risky
behavior that provides insight on what determines risk preferences. Risk
preferences a r e driven by a combination of influences, which have been
described as situational a n d constant factors (Sitkin & Pablo, 1992). In
general, situational factors, such as problem framing (e.g., Kahneman &
Tversky, 19791, reference points (e.g., Lopes, 1987; March, 1988), levels of
organizational slack (Cyert & March, 1963), a n d escalation of commitment
(Brockner, 1992), have been found to influence risk perceptions. More constant factors, such as individual dispositions (Laughunn, Payne, & Crum,
1980). national culture (Hofstede, 1980). a n d organizational culture (Morgan, 19861, combine to determine managerial risk preferences. Therefore,
a manager's risk preference may vary on a spectrum from risk aversion
through risk neutrality to risk seeking, depending on a combination of

<-----Page 10----->82

influences. In their study, March a n d Shapira summarized the important findings of this research stream: "[Firms] . . . can show unstable
risk-taking behavior in the neighborhood of death, relatively high levels
of risk taking when slack resources a r e large, risk seeking in the neighborhood of a target, a tendency to change risk preference over time with
the same resources, a n d a tendency to underestimate risks as a result of
favorable experience with them" (1992: 181).

Governance Structure Implications of Variable Risk Preferences
Although users of TCE acknowledge that the risk attitudes of managers "for some purposes can be of utmost importance" (Williamson, 1985:
389), the adoption of the assumption of risk neutrality h a s effectively suppressed these issues in TCE. We suggest that the efficacy of the theory
can be enhanced only by a n examination of the implications of variable
risk preferences for the governance structure predictions of the model.
The essence of the TCE perspective on governance structures is captured
in a heuristic model by Williamson, which, in a "reduced form analysis"
(1991: 282), explores the relationship between governance costs a n d asset
specificity.5 The model presented in Figure 1 is based directly on Williamson's model.
In essence, the model offered by Williamson suggests that there is a
single level of asset specificity (K,, in Figure l), which represents the
"switchover" point at which firms a r e indifferent between market a n d
hierarchy as forms of governance. For levels of asset specificity that a r e
below this switchover level, the argument goes, firms will choose market
procurement, a n d for levels above, internal organization will be preferred. As illustrated in Figure 1, the switchover level is determined by the
intersection between the transaction-cost curve for market governance
a n d the transaction-cost curve for hierarchy. We argue that the switchover level of asset specificity will vary as a function of the risk preference
of the firm. The risk, or possible loss associated with the transaction, will
vary with the level of asset specificity of the transaction. As discussed
previously, the utility associated with a given level of risk is determined
by the s h a p e of the utility function of the firm. Therefore, the shape of the
transaction-cost curve for market governance6 will vary with the risk preference of the firm. Because the switchover level of asset specificity is
determined by the intersection between the transaction-cost curves for
market a n d hierarchy, it will vary with the risk preference of the firm.
Thus, the level of asset specificity (K,, in Figure 1) a t which a risk-averse
firm will prefer hierarchy to market will be lower than that of a riskIn his 1991 article, Williamson included hybrid forms of governance in the model.
Because inclusion of such forms would unnecessarily complicate the essential argument
m a d e here, they a r e excluded from the illustrations in Figures 1 a n d 2 in the interests of
clarity. Their exclusion does not imply they a r e irrelevant; w e show later that they a r e
relevant, especially for transactions infused with trust. Thus, references to market in this
article a r e not limited to spot-market contracts involving little or no asset specificity a n d
anonymous actors. Such references also include long-term contracts across a market interface, which embody elements of hierarchy (Stinchcombe, 1990; Williamson, 1985)a n d higher
levels of asset specificity (Williamson, 1985)-the so-called hybrid form.
The variance of transaction costs across levels of asset specificity i s much greater for
costs of market governance than for costs of hierarchy (Williamson, 1985, 1991). Although it
could b e argued that costs of hierarchy also vary with risk preferences, the effects would b e
in the s a m e direction but less pronounced. Therefore, w e have represented them with a
single curve, in order to simplify the model.

neutral firm, (K,,), which, in turn, will be lower than the switchover level
for a risk-seeking firm (K,,). The choice of governance structure will vary
with the risk preference of the firm. Therefore, we propose
Proposition 1: Risk-seeking firms will continue to transact in the market at higher levels of asset specificity
than either risk-neutral or risk-averse firms.
Proposition 2: Risk-averse firms will vertically integrate
transactions at lower levels of asset specificity than either risk-neutral or risk-seeking firms.
The failure of authors to define the meaning of risk in TCE h a s led to
some ambiguity in subsequent discussions. For instance, one of three
defenses offered by Williamson to justify the use of this assumption is that
"if the penalties for incapacity to bear risk a r e great, parties have strong
incentives to craft structures with superior risk-bearing properties" (1985:
389). However, if risk is a subjective phenomenon, these penalties do not
apply to risk-neutral actors. Faced with two transactions of unequal returns, a risk-neutral actor will choose the higher return, irrespective of
risk, thus avoiding any penalties. The defense offered by Williamson
seems to imply a view of risk as a n objective feature of the exogenous
environment. Following this interpretation, Ring a n d Van d e Ven proposed that "consistent with Williamson . . . the greater the risks in a
transaction, the more complex the governance structure, ceteris paribus"
(1992: 488). This proposition is consistent with Williamson's work, but it is
only consistent with a n assumption of risk neutrality if risk is a n objective
phenomenon. The subjective definition of risk adopted in this article is
grounded in research on how managers view risk (MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986; March & Shapira, 19871, and, therefore, we argue, it is more
realistic than the interpretation implied in Williamson's work. We further
suggest that a subjective view of risk is more consistent with the subjective view of costs that we have already argued is implicit in mainstream
TCE research.
In essence, the assumption of risk neutrality h a s relegated variable
risk preferences to the status of a n omitted variable in empirical TCE
research to date, thereby reducing the predictive efficacy of the theory.
Our examination of risk neutrality in the TCE model suggests that a more
realistic assumption-that of variable risk preferences-can be adopted
with relative e a s e a n d with little threat to parsimony. We have illustrated
that when variable risk preferences a r e incorporated in the model, the
switchover level from market to hierarchy for a transaction of a given
level of asset specificity, uncertainty, a n d frequency of interaction will
vary, according to those risk preferences.

INTEGRATING THE BEHAVIORAL ASSUMPTIONS OF TCE 

USING TRUST 

We believe that progress in theory development h a s been impeded by
a tendency to treat the behavioral assumptions of TCE as separate a n d

<-----Page 13----->1996

distinct. This tendency underlies the neglect of risk neutrality and also
explains the dearth of attention to the interactive nature of these assumptions. In this section, we use the social-context variable of trust to unify
TCE's three behavioral assumptions and illustrate how risk and trust
interact to influence the governance-structure predictions of the theory.
Trust is chosen for this task because in the literature it is related to each
of the behavioral assumptions. The relationship between trust and opportunism h a s been widely established Ie.g., Bradach & Eccles, 1989;
Granovetter, 1985; Larson, 1992); the relationship between trust a n d
bounded rationality h a s received slight attention (Lincoln, 1990; Powell,
1990); a n d the relationship between trust and risk has just begun to be
explored (Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992).
Additional justification for incorporating trust into the TCE model
comes from calls by proponents within the TCE paradigm for its inclusion.
Williamson acknowledged that although transaction-cost economizing is
the primary focus of TCE, "the costs need to be located in the larger
context of which they are a part . . . [including] the social context in which
the transactions are embedded" (1985: 22). In this regard, he acknowledged that "trust is important and businessmen rely on it much more
extensively than is commonly realized" (Williamson, 1975: 108). Although
trust is given passing recognition as a n important social context variable,
it is not incorporated into the mainstream model of TCE. Williamson (1985:
406) acknowledged both that the difficulties in operationalizing and "unpacking" trust were more the domain of the organization theorist than the
economist and that attention to behavioral and governance features that
transcend the mainstream model of TCE may be needed. In this section,
we attempt to "unpack" trust and incorporate it into the TCE model. By
doing so, we begin to relax the assumptions of opportunism and bounded
rationality in keeping with a deductive approach to theory building.
A Structured View of Trust

Trust can be defined as increasing one's vulnerability to the risk of
opportunistic behavior of one's transaction partner, whose behavior is not
under one's control in a situation in which the costs of violating the trust
are greater than the benefits of upholding the trust (Zand, 1972). Without
vulnerability to the risk of opportunism, there is no need to trust. Some
degree of risk must be present so that there is a test of trust (Dasgupta,
1988). Trust also may be defined as the expectation that a n exchange
partner will not engage in opportunistic behavior, even in the face of
countervailing short-term incentives (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Frank, 1993;
Orbell, Dawes, & Schwartz-Shea, 1994) and uncertainty about long-term
benefits. Both definitions address risk either explicitly or implicitly; thus,
trust requires risk. However, what would cause economic actors to increase their vulnerability or to have such expectations? Why would parties to a n economic exchange refrain from opportunistic behavior? These
questions may be addressed by viewing the conditions that generate trust

<-----Page 14----->86

through three interpretive lenses-two sociological a n d one economic in
nature (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Husted, 1989).
First, the conditions that generate trust may be viewed through the
interpretive lens of social norms. In this case, "global trust in generalized
others" (Butler, 1991: 643) is generated as a result of social norms, such as
norms of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960),norms of obligation a n d cooperation
(Bradach & Eccles, 1989), a n d norms of fairness (Kahneman, Knetsch, &
Thaler, 1986). Such social norms generate shared expectations among
people a t various societal levels, including the larger society (Gouldner,
1960),regional a n d local culture, ethnic or religious sectors, industry sectors by way of standard business practices a n d trade associations, a n d
professional a n d occupational sectors (Husted, 1989; Zucker, 1986). This
view w a s also expressed by Durkheim, who believed that economic exchange relations were enforced a n d regulated by "an obligation imposed
by society as a whole . . . or . . . by a n occupational group of professional
practitioners" (cited in Dore, 1983: 471). Thus, it is the honoring of moral
obligations inherent in these social norms that generates trust, which, in
turn, constrains opportunistic behavior.
Second, the conditions that generate trust may be viewed through the
interpretive lens of social embeddedness. In this case, "situational trust
in specific others" (Butler, 1991: 643) is generated as a result of personal
relations that arise in the course of economic transactions. Macauley
(1963) discussed U.S. managers' concern that detailed attention to contracts may have the undesirable consequences of signaling a lack of trust
a n d the damaging of a friendship. Likewise, Granovetter (1985)viewed a n
economic actor's purposeful behavior as embedded in concrete personal
relations a n d networks of personal relations that generate trust a n d discourage malfeasance. similarly, Dore argued that it is a "sense of duty
. . . a particular sense of diffuse obligation to the individual trading partner" (1983: 470-471) that generates trust a n d constrains opportunistic behavior in Japanese relational contracting. Thus, it is the honoring of personal obligations inherent in socially embedded economic transactions
that generates trust, which, in turn, constrains opportunistic behavior.
Third, the conditions that generate trust may be viewed through the
interpretive lens of rational economics. In this case, "trust-like behavior"
(Husted, 1989: 32; Frank, 1993) is generated in a multiperiod prisoners'
dilemma game as a result of self-interest-seeking, utility-maximizing individuals making net-present-value calculations, the results of which indicate net benefits to refraining from short-term opportunistic behavior.
Game theory h a s been widely enlisted as a means of explaining such
behavior (Axelrod, 1984; Frank, 1993; Heide & Miner, 1992; Hill, 1990;
Parkhe, 1993). In a multiperiod prisoners' dilemma, both parties act with
the expectation that they may engage each other again. This expectation
of future economic relations, known as the "shadow of the future" (Axelrod, 1984: 126),constrains the actors' opportunistic behavior in the current
period. Thus, it is a purely economic calculus employed by self-interest-

<-----Page 15----->1996

seeking actors devoid of social norms or social embeddedness that generates this type of trust, which, in turn, constrains opportunistic behavior.
Up to this point, we have employed both attitudinal a n d behavioral
conceptions of trust by using such terms as trust a n d trust-like behavior,
respectively. This distinction between trust a n d trusting behavior deserves further comment. Zand (1972) described a spiral reinforcement process, in which one's inner state of trust (mistrust) becomes transformed
into behavior that is trusting (mistrusting). In this case, there is a bidirectional link between trust a n d trusting behavior, in which each reinforces the other, such that they become isomorphic. Following Zand, w e
take the position that trust a n d trusting behavior a r e inseparable.
We have thus far argued (a)that the conditions that generate trust
can b e viewed through three interpretive lenses a n d (b) that trust constrains opportunistic behavior. In addition to this direct link between trust
a n d the constraining of opportunistic behavior, this relationship can be
mediated by reputation. Reputation is a multidimensional construct. A
firm's reputation can be construed as a reputation for reliability (Weigelt
& Camerer, 19881, predation (Kreps & Wilson, 1982; Milgrom & Roberts,
1982), quality (Weigelt & Camerer, 1988), tit-for-tat behavior (Buckley &
Casson, 1988), honesty (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992), or trustworthiness (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992; Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992). A reputation for trustworthiness is a n asset in which firms invest by engaging in trustworthy
behavior. This asset can be a signal to other actors-both those that have
interacted with the party in the past a n d those that have not-of a party's
trustworthiness based on its prior history of trustworthy behavior. Parties
possessing such reputational assets would be willing to forego desirable
short-term outcomes obtainable through opportunistic behavior in order
to protect their valued reputation a n d the long-term benefits it provides,
such as decreased costs of finding a n d contracting with future exchange
partners. Thus, trust can lead to the constraining of opportunistic behavior by way of reputation. As a final note, the link between trust (and,
hence, trusting behavior) a n d reputation for trustworthiness also can be
bidirectional a n d subject to spiral reinforcement processes as described
above.
In sum, we have sketched a structured view of trust by using multiple
interpretive lenses a n d shown how reputation effects enter into such a
framework. Building on this foundation, we turn next to investigate how
trust can serve to integrate all the behavioral assumptions of TCE.
Trust, Opportunism, and Transaction Cost Economics

The behavioral assumption of opportunism holds that individuals a r e
"self-interest seeking with guile" (Williamson, 1985: 47). Importantly, not
all actors a r e assumed to behave opportunistically, but rather some probability exists that any given actor will do so some of the time. The traditional TCE paradigm assumes this probability to increase as investments
in specific assets by the other party increase (Hill, 1990).The party making

<-----Page 16----->88

significant investments in transaction-specific assets is placed at risk of
exploitation by the other party as a consequence of the latter's opportunistic behavior. Accordingly, the transaction costs incurred in establishing safeguards for such market transactions can exceed the bureaucratic
costs of internal organization, thus occasioning a change in governance
structure from market to hierarchy, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Many scholars have critically addressed the assumption of opportunism (Granovetter, 1985; Heide & John, 1992; Hill, 1990; Larson, 1992; Maitland, Bryson, & Van d e Ven, 1985) as less than realistic for a wide range
of economic exchange relationships, instead viewing such relations as
infused with trust rather than opportunism. We concur a n d argue that
trust's role in constraining opportunistic behavior allows parties to adopt
less elaborate safeguards, thereby economizing on transaction costs and,
in turn, altering the choice of governance structure. In other words, the
introduction of trust in the TCE model can alter the efficient boundaries of
the firm.
In the face of opportunism, contracts have to be laden with safeguards that a r e designed to protect each party from the opportunistic
behavior of the other. Such safeguards a r e costly a n d include costs associated with negotiating, drafting, a n d monitoring contracts. For contractual relations infused with trust, the risk of opportunism is attenua t e d , thus reducing the e l a b o r a t e n e s s a n d costs associated with
contractual safeguards. Trust decreases negotiating costs by fostering a
game-type approach to negotiations in which actors are cooperative a n d
quick to come to a resolution rather than a tactical-type approach in
which actors a r e cautious a n d slow to come to a resolution (R. M. March,
1988). Trust decreases drafting costs by allowing contracts to be specified
more loosely with the expectation that any ex ante gaps in the contract
will be dealt with ex post in a fair manner. Trust decreases monitoring
costs as a result of each party's confidence in the other's performance,
even though short-term incentives may favor opportunism. Trust also decreases the costs associated with more complex safeguards such as bonding, a n d as noted previously, a party's reputation for trustworthiness decreases the costs of finding a n exchange partner. Because the costs
associated with contractual safeguards a n d search are, in fact, transaction costs, trust economizes on transaction costs.
The introduction of trust in the TCE model can shift the comparative
costs of governance (as illustrated in Figure 2 by the rightward shift in the
family of market governance cost curves) a n d can alter the choice of
governance structures (as noted by the resulting increase in the level of
asset specificity a t which market governance is preferred relative to bureaucratic governance). As such, inclusion of the social-context variable
of trust in the TCE framework will yield a model with greater predictive
power.
Transactions involving sufficiently large investments in transactionspecific assets that would conventionally be assigned to a hierarchical

<-----Page 17----->1996

89

governance structure in the absence of trust may be assigned to a hybrid
governance structure in the presence of trust. Hybrid structures entail
recurrent, long-term relations between autonomous economic actors
where nontrivial specific assets a r e involved. Ring and Van d e Ven explicated recurrent a n d relational contracting as structures where "trust is
the principle mode of social control" (1992: 491)-both are types of hybrid
governance structures. Similarly, Helper emphasized "governance by
trust" (1990: 153) in contractual relations of a long-term, bilateral naturealso a type of hybrid governance structure. Finally, Granovetter (1985)
viewed virtually all economic transactions as embedded in a structure of
personal relations. Accordingly, he argued that the neoclassical anonymous market was virtually nonexistent and that a wide range of complex
economic transactions could occur across the market interface without
resorting to hierarchical governance. For transactions involving longterm relations and social embeddedness, he argued that hybrid governance structures could even be superior to hierarchical governance structures in generating trust and discouraging opportunism.
Trust, Bounded Rationality, and Transaction Cost Economics

TCE utilizes the behavioral assumption of bounded rationality where
"human behavior is intendedly rational, but only limitedly so" (Simon,
1961: xxiv). Hence, the cognitive limitations of human actors a r e acknowledged. As a result, economic actors do not possess the wits necessary to
write comprehensive contracts that account for all possible contingencies. Thus, incomplete contracting occurs.
Furthermore, it is instructive to observe the pairing that exists between bounded rationality a n d uncertaintylcomplexity (Williamson,
1975). In t h e a b s e n c e of bounded rationality andlor uncertainty1
complexity, complete contracting is obtained, and no interesting choices
are left to be made regarding governance structures (Williamson, 1975).
Bounded rationality is, however, not absent-people a r e all encumbered
by cognitive limits rooted in the human physiological makeup. Importantly, bounds on rationality have salience "only to the extent that the
limits of rationality a r e reached-which is to say, under conditions of
uncertainty and/or complexity" (Williamson, 1975: 22). It is bounded rationality relative to the uncertainty/complexity of the contracting world that
is important with regard to specifying contracts and assessing alternative
governance structures (Williamson, 1975). Thus, if one can reduce the
level of uncertaintylcomplexity, then it is said that one has economized on
bounded rationality.
We argue that a relationship exists between trust and bounded rationality a n d that the relationship is mediated by information, influence,
and control-a group of variables identified by Zand (1972). Specifically,
the existence of trust in a contractual relationship may lead to (a)information exchange that is more accurate, comprehensive, and timely; (b)
greater receptivity to influence by others; and (c) relaxation of controls on

<-----Page 18----->90

others, which, in turn, reduces behavioral uncertainty/complexity (i.e.,
each party will have greater certainty as to the behavior of the other)
(Zand, 1972), which, in turn, "economizes" on bounded rationality. In sum,
trust in contractual relations may reduce behavioral uncertainty1
complexity, thus rendering bounded rationality less harmful a n d less
salient. Lincoln (1990) a n d Powell (1990) made similar arguments, though
they did not explicate the critical links of information, influence, a n d
control. Lincoln noted that the "rich integration of relations of trust a n d
obligation with business transactions 'economizes' on bounded rationality a n d uncertainty" (1990: 281). Likewise, Powell proposed that "trust reduces complex realities far more quickly a n d economically than prediction, authority, or bargaining" (1990: 305).
Williamson (1985) noted that bounded rationality concerns not only
decision processes as we have dealt with above, but it also concerns
governance structures. In particular, Williamson (1975, 1985) noted the
importance of devising governance structures that economize on bounded
rationality, that is to say, the relative disfavoring of governance structures that "make large demands against cognitive competence" (Williamson, 1985: 46). By rendering bounded rationality less harmful or less salient, trust c a n c a u s e c h a n g e s in the comparative efficacy among
governance structures. Thus, the introduction of trust in the TCE model
can shift the comparative costs of governance (as illustrated in Figure 2 by
the rightward shift in the family of market governance cost curves) a n d
can alter the choice of governance structures (as noted by the resulting
increase in the level of asset specificity at which market governance is
preferred relative to bureaucratic governance).
Trust, Risk, and Transaction Cost Economics

Although a relationship between trust a n d risk h a s been established
(Ring & Van d e Ven, 1992), the complex a n d interactive nature of this
relationship renders causal links difficult to establish. Both trust a n d risk
are, as we have illustrated, subjective concepts embedded in a web of
social relationships. As such, the relationship between them is suffused
with "the complexities of parallel processing, bidirectional causality a n d
reverberating feedback that characterize both cognitive a n d social organizations" (McGuire, 1973: 448).
Consider, for instance, how information permeates the relationship
among trust, risk, a n d transaction costs. Risk in this context is the perceived risk that a partner to a transaction that involves asset-specific
investments will behave opportunistically, consistent with our definition
of risk as the subjective possibility of loss as perceived by the decision
maker. First, trust can indirectly affect transaction costs via the need (or
lack thereof) to exchange information. If I trust you, I will let you make
choices that take my perspective into account; because there is less need
for verification of your behavior, information exchange is reduced, leading to lower transaction costs. Conversely, if I do not trust you, I will want

vant, comprehensive, accurate, timely (Zand, 1972)' or proprietary (Ring &
Van d e Ven, 1992) information to you and, hence, less need to have elaborate contracts to safeguard my interests and, thus, lower transaction
costs. Conversely, if I do not trust you, then I perceive greater risk in
divulging such information to you, a n d I will desire more elaborate contracts to safeguard my interests and, thus, higher transaction costs.
If one considers the multidimensional nature of trust as outlined, a n d
inasmuch as information is but one of three components of risk as seen by
managers-the others being time a n d control (MacCrimmon & Wehrung,
1986)-our discussion reveals something of the complexity of the relationship among trust, risk, a n d TCE. A complete analysis of this complex
relationship is beyond our scope. We can, however, clearly recognize that
the subjective risk of any transaction will be influenced by both the risk
appetite of the firm's managers a n d the degree to which the parties trust
each other. In other words, the perceived risk of opportunistic behavior by
a counterparty to a transaction that involves asset-specific investments
will b e influenced by the risk preferences of a firm's managers a n d the
level of trust in the relationship.
In concluding this section, we present a model of how risk preferences a n d trust can be jointly integrated into the mainstream TCE framework. We propose that there a r e several different levels of asset specificity a t which firms will change their preferred governance structure from
market to hierarchy, depending on the joint effects of risk a n d trust. First,
as previously illustrated, the utility associated with market governance in
a particular firm i s a function of the risk preference of the firm. We have
already proposed that a risk-averse firm will switch from market to hierarchy a t a lower level of asset specificity (K,, in Figure 1) than a riskneutral firm (K,, in Figure 1) a n d that the switchover level of asset specificity for a risk-neutral firm will, in turn, b e lower than that of a riskseeking firm (K,, in Figure 1). Second, recognition that transactions a r e
embedded in a social context, in which the level of trust between transacting parties is a critical determinant of the perceived risk of opportunism, leads to the realization that the switchover level of asset specificity
will be greater for transactions between parties who trust each other than
between opportunistic parties, as illustrated in Figure 2.
Finally, the incorporating of the spectrum of risk preferences into the
model a n d the recognizing of the importance of trust yields a range of
predicted governance structures as a function of the risk preferences of
the transactors a n d the social context in which the transaction takes
place. The switchover level of asset specificity predicted in the model
presented by Williamson (1991) is therefore only one of a number of possible outcomes, representing the relatively narrow case in which firms
are risk neutral a n d behave opportunistically. The switchover level of
asset specificity will be determined in part by the risk preference of the
firm a n d the level of trust in the relationship with the counterparty. Figure
2 illustrates a n integrated model of trust a n d risk that shows how they

<-----Page 21----->1996

jointly affect the assignment of governance structures. We suggest that
the expanded model presented here is more complete a n d offers ample
scope within the TCE framework to help explain anomalies such as those
identified by Robins (1987) a n d Monteverde a n d Teece (1982). In short,
incorporating risk a n d trust into the TCE paradigm enhances the explanatory a n d predictive power of the theory with relatively little loss of parsimony. The following is therefore proposed:
Proposition 3: The switchover level of asset specificity at
which firms will choose to structure transactions within
the firm rather than in the market will be greater for a
risk-averse (risk-neutral, risk-seeking) firm engaged in
transactions infused with higher levels of trust than for
a n equally risk-averse (risk-neutral, risk-seeking) firm
engaged in a transaction infused with lower levels of
trust.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
We have offered a number of propositions from which testable hypotheses can be derived. Moving from the theoretical propositions offered
here to empirical research will require researchers to confront a variety of
conceptual a n d measurement issues not yet addressed in this article. The
first major empirical issue will concern measurement of both risk a n d
trust. We concur with Eisenhardt, who suggested that "studying risk preferences is particularly opportune because of recent advances in measuring risk preferences" (1989: 70). The works of MacCrimmon a n d Wehrung
(1986) a n d March a n d Shapira (1987) provide a base for researchers in this
area. Progress also h a s been made regarding the measurement of trust.
Butler (1991), in a review of measurements of trust a n d conditions of trust,
offered the conditions of trust inventory (CTI) as a n instrument. Butler's
work a n d that which h e reviews should prove valuable to researchers
seeking to test the propositions advanced in this article. Some measurement issues posed by our propositions are, however, too complex to be
resolved in such a straightforward manner. The risk instruments just described essentially measure managerial attitudes. TCE, in contrast, purports to predict firm behaviors. The further question of the links between
these attitudes a n d firm behaviors also must be addressed.
Variables that moderate the relationship between managerial risk
preferences a n d a firm's risk behaviors must be considered. Three directions a r e suggested as potentially rewarding. First, agency theorists have
identified a number of variables that influence the relationship between
the risk preferences of owners a n d managers (Eisenhardt, 1989). Our proposal that agency theory can be a source of variables for inclusion in TCE
models is consistent with Williamson's (1988)view that these theories a r e
complementary. Second, although TCE focuses our attention on choice of
governance structure, a firm's risk preferences may manifest themselves

<-----Page 22----->94

Academy of Management Review

in a variety of other ways. For instance, a firm can choose a highly leveraged financial structure, or it can pursue a more risky strategy as its
modus operandi (Miles & Snow, 1978; Williamson, 1988); in employment
relationships, spot-market contracting carries risks (for the employer) of
opportunistic behavior by employees with idiosyncratic knowledge a n d
skills (Williamson, Wachter, & Harris, 19751, which can be eliminated
most effectively by structuring the relationship within the firm. Thus,
even managers who a r e "risk seeking" by disposition may behave in a
"risk-averse" manner with respect to choice of governance structures, if
they are pursuing risky strategies in financial or other areas. Further
research is needed on the role of functional perspective in determining
risk preferences (Melone, 1994).
Applying TCE as a theory of managerial decision making relies, we
argue, on the treatment of economic costs as subjective costs. This idea
also h a s important research implications. Subjective costs cannot be
measured post hoc using accounting data. In a subjective interpretation,
the costs that a r e relevant to the decision a r e those that are considered in
the decision calculus of the decision maker at the moment of decision. In
order to measure these subjective transaction costs, researchers must
therefore gather d a t a via direct contact with decision makers (Parkhe,
1993). A number of methods can be adopted. The use of mail a n d telephone questionnaires a n d face-to-face interviews a r e well-established
research techniques in the social sciences (Judd, Smith, & Kidder, 1991).
All of these techniques could be applied to measure subjective costs, but
they a r e vulnerable to the heuristics a n d biases that distort memory of
even important events in people's lives (e.g., Dawes, 1988). We suggest
that the use of verbal protocols can more accurately measure subjective
transaction costs. Verbal protocols are the taped thought processes of
decision makers who think aloud while making a decision. Decisions in
verbal protocol studies usually a r e not "real," but they a r e scenarios created by the researcher, a n d they vary on the dimensions of interest. For
example, Melone (1994) gathered verbal protocols from a sample of CFOs
a n d VPs of corporations in the food services industry to examine the influence that roles a n d experience have on the decision processes of corporate executives. Although verbal protocols have some obvious shortcomings as a research technique (e.g., the artificiality of the decision
scenario a n d whether the protocols reflect the true thought processes of
the decision maker), they do yield unique insights into the decision calculus used by managers when making decisions. As such, they are eminently suitable for the study of TCE.
A limitation of TCE research to date, both empirical a n d theoretical,
h a s been the dearth of practical advice for managers that it h a s produced.
We believe that our treatment of the model enhances the realism of the
theory because it incorporates realistic assumptions about risk a n d trust,
based on studies of how managers actually treat these issues (e.g., MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986). The research methods suggested previously

also can yield useful information for managers. First, we must identify
the extent to which a transaction-cost calculus is applied in decision
making by managers of different functional backgrounds in a variety of
situations (Walker & Weber, 1984). Next, we can examine the outcomes of
decisions to determine whether, or in what circumstances, use of a transaction-cost-economizing calculus leads to more economically efficient decisions. Once such information h a s been gathered, researchers can assess the need for, a n d potential benefits of, training managers in the
conscious use of transaction cost analysis.
Finally, w e acknowledge two important limitations of this article.
First, TCE, with efficiency analysis a t its core, h a s a n important place in
the multiparadigm world of organization theory, but to claim that it is the
only paradigm would be foolhardy. "[Tlhere is more to organization theory
than economizing on transaction costs . . . [but] efficiency analysis is
important to the study of all forms of organizations a n d is absolutely
crucial to the study of commercial organizations" (Williamson & Ouchi,
1981: 367-368). Some alternative explanations for the empirical anomalies
described previously include power a n d resource dependency (Pfeffer &
Salancik, 1978; Williamson & Ouchi, 1981), strategy (Eccles, 1987; Williamson, 1991), differential organizational size (Kimberly, 1976), a n d disequilibrium effects. Referring to these alternatives, Williamson (1985, 1991)
a n d Williamson a n d Ouchi (1981) invoked the larger context of economic
natural selection a n d argued that such considerations, although sometimes worth acknowledging in the short run, usually give way to efficiency considerations in the long run, especially for profit-making enterprises. Ultimately, the question of which paradigm or alternative
explanation is capable of explaining the most variance in governance
structures is a n empirical one.
Second, we refer to the temporal aspects of both trust a n d risk.
Though we do not address the stability of the trusting relationship, Slovic
(1993) argued that trust is fragile, is created slowly, a n d is destroyed
easily. "Thus, once trust is lost, it may take a long time to rebuild it to its
former state. In some instances lost trust may never be regained" (Slovic,
1993: 8). The stability over time of economic relations infused with trust
may provide a fruitful avenue for future research. A similar argument can
be made for risk, as a substantial body of empirical research h a s demonstrated (e.g., March & Shapira, 1992). The decision-making literature
offers important insights on the relationship between time a n d risk, the
implications of which a r e not fully explored in this article.

CONCLUSIONS 

We have argued that many of the perceived shortcomings of the TCE
paradigm a r e in part attributable to the inadequate treatment of risk a n d
trust in earlier empirical a n d theoretical work. Williamson's adoption of
the behavioral assumption of risk neutrality h a s had the effect of render-

ing TCE silent on one of the fundamental determinants of economic behavior. The social-context variable of trust interacts with all three behavioral assumptions of the TCE model a n d therefore must be addressed in
future treatments. Using Williamson's framework, we have illustrated the
relative e a s e with which risk a n d trust can be incorporated into the
theoretical model. We also uncovered the heretofore implicit assumption
in much TCE research that transaction costs are subjective. Finally, we
proposed a direction for research in TCE that can yield more practical
advice for managers.
