Abstract
Relationships are an important solution to information problems in finance. This
study addresses relational financing for a class of investors who face particularly
severe information problems—venture capitalists (VCs). Using a hand-collected
dataset of 637 serial founders, I examine how often and why a serial founder receives
financing for his new company from a VC who also was an investor in his previous
company. Such repeated relationships are surprisingly uncommon. Only one in ten
VC investments leads to a repeated relationship and only one in three serial founders
enters into a repeated relationship with any previous VC. VCs with more information
about a founder are significantly more likely to engage in relational financing, but the
likelihood of repeated relationships is lower when the new company is in a
geographically distant location. Relationship VCs are more involved in the founder’s
new company.

<-----Page 1----->The existence and importance of relationship ties between lending banks and borrowing
companies have been studied extensively in finance. Studies have shown that relational bank lending
is driven to a large extent by the value of preserving information. Banks, acting as active financial
intermediaries, collect proprietary information about a borrower (Diamond, 1984), and this
information can be reused in future interactions between the bank and borrower to minimize adverse
selection problems and lower the cost of monitoring (Black, 1975; Fama, 1985, Greenbaum &
Thakor, 1995). Empirical studies have shown that relational bank financing is indeed beneficial—
companies with stronger bank relationships have better access to credit (Petersen & Rajan, 1994;
Cole, 1998) and pay lower borrowing costs (Hellman, Lindsey & Puri, 2007; Berger & Udell, 1995;
Bharath et al, 2007b, Ivashina & Kovner, 2007).
This paper presents an empirical study of relational financing in a setting in which
information problems are likely to be more significant than they are in a typical bank lending
situation—the financing of entrepreneurial companies by venture capitalists (VCs). Compared with
mature companies with assets in place, startup companies have greater information problems and
cannot mitigate these by pledging collateral. I analyze how often and why a serial founder receives
financing for his new company from a VC that also was an investor in the same founder’s previous
company, thereby engaging in a repeated VC relationship. As a brief preview of my findings, such
relational financing arrangements are surprisingly uncommon: Only one in ten VC involvements leads
to a repeated relationship with a serial founder. Relational financing reflects a tradeoff between
capitalizing on information about a founder and obtaining a good match between the characteristics of
the founder’s new company and the VC’s investment preferences. Repeated relationships are found to
be significantly more common among VCs that have shown strong involvement in a serial founder’s
previous company and for a serial founder whose companies are located geographically near one
another or are in the same industry. Overall, my analysis demonstrates that VCs in some financing
situations behave like informed investors who engage in relational financing and at other times like
uninformed arms-length investors.

<-----Page 2----->While this paper is the first to study relational financing between serial founders and VCs, the
choice of continuing or ending financing relationships on the part of banks has previously been
studied by Ongena and Smith (2001), Bharath et al (2007a), and Radhakrishnan, Udell and Yerramill
(2007). My study examines not only relational financing for different types of important financial
intermediaries but also focuses on repeated financing relationships between companies an not on
relationships within a particular company. This difference is important because follow-up financing
events within a company, although interesting to explore, are potentially affected by the need of
existing investors to maintain control and cross-subsidize earlier investments. By researching
relational financing between separate companies I am able to remove the effects of such motivations.
Also, I am able to isolate effects related to the founder from those related to intangible or tangible
company assets.
A further benefit of studying relational financing between venture-backed companies is that I
can identify the causal link between investor involvement and the propensity to engage in a repeated
relationship. This causality is hard to prove for banking relationships because banks are likely to make
early investments in a company with the expectation that they can leverage information by building a
long-term lending relationship (Sharpe, 1990; Rajan, 1992). VCs are very unlikely to make the
strategic choice of investing in a founder based on the expectation that the founder will many years
later start a new company and thereby potentially have a repeated relationship with his previous VC
investors. Because only about 10% of all founders become serial founders and only 10% of all VC
involvements lead to a repeated relationship for a serial founder, the joint probability of a VC
investment leading to a repeated relationship is so low that it is very unlikely that VCs let the
possibility of a repeated relationship affect investment decisions.
The sample is a hand-collected dataset comprising 637 serial founders of U.S. venture-backed
companies. The founders collectively receive financing from 1,608 unique VC firms. The first step in
my empirical analysis is to examine the average frequency of repeated VC relationships for serial
founders. It is reasonable to expect that relational financing should be empirically at least as important
for VCs as it has shown to be for banks. This expectation could be motivated in three ways. Firstly,
3

<-----Page 3----->VC markets are generally more local and opaque. Secondly, VCs use financial securities that are more
equity-like than bank debt and thereby more sensitive to information. Thirdly, because VCs finance
primarly early-stage companies in non-traditional industries for which information and agency
problems are significant, they are on the whole more active investors than banks. VCs do thorough
due diligence and screening of potential investment targets (Kaplan & Strömberg, 2004; Bengtsson et
al 2005), and engage in active post-investment monitoring via boards of directors and meetings with a
company’s founders and management teams (Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; Hellmann & Puri, 2002;
Wongsunwai, 2007). These activities give a VC that invests in a company significant information that
could be reused in future interactions with the founder. Indirect evidence that information about the
founder is valuable for a VC is found in Gompers et al (2007a), who show that founder talent is
transferable between companies and is important for the success of a startup company.
The logic above suggests that relational financing might be commonplace in the VC industry.
I find evidence that the opposite is true. The overall frequency of repeated relationships between VCs
and serial founders is surprisingly low. Only one out of ten VC involvements leads to a repeated
relationship and only one in three founders has a repeated relationship with any previous VC investor.
From a theoretical perspective my results are puzzling as they show that relational financing is often
forgone in a financing situation where information problems are severe and where previous investors
are likely to possess valuable information. As an illustration, the probability of a VC’s engaging in
relational financing between companies started by a serial founder is considerably lower than the
42%-52% probability than a lead bank engages in relational lending with a company (Radhakrishnan,
Udell & Yerramill, 2007, Bharath et al, 2007a and 2007b).
The second step in my analysis partially resolves the puzzle that relational VC financing is
relatively uncommon. I test the role of information and VC investment preferences by studying why
serial founders and VCs choose to repeat or not to repeat a relationship. Building directly on insights
from the literature on relational bank lending, I argue that an active investor that finances companies
with significant information problems will face a tradeoff when choosing whether to repeat a
relationship. The first part of this tradeoff is that relational financing is beneficial because valuable
4

<-----Page 4----->information about a founder could be reused by the investor, which lowers both pre- and postinvestment information costs. The second part of the tradeoff is that relational financing is costly
because VCs are specialized and a serial founder needs to find a VC with a good match with his new
company.
Consistent with the hypothesis that relationships are repeated to capitalize on private
information, I find that VCs that have more proprietary information about the founder are also more
likely to engage in relational financing. The magnitudes are large—a VC that holds a board seat in the
founder’s previous company is twice as likely to also be an investor in the same founder’s new
company. Similarly, the most-involved VCs are more than six times more likely than the leastinvolved VCs (26% versus 4%) to have a repeated relationship. I find further evidence that
information is an important factor in determining the choice to engage in relational VC financing. The
probability of a repeated relationship decreases with the relevance of the information, which is
measured by the number of years between the founder’s previous and new companies. Moreover, if a
founder has many VC investors in his previous company and such VCs have common information
about the founder, then we would expect that each individual VC should be less likely to form a
repeated relationship if the total number of possible repeated relationships is greater. I find supportive
evidence for this hypothesis.
The other side of the tradeoff for relational financing is investor specialization. There is
substantial empirical evidence that VCs specialize by industry and geographical area to facilitate due
diligence and monitoring, and to add value to portfolio companies. Such specialization follows from
the need for active involvement. (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992; Norton & Tenenbaum, 1993; Stuart &
Sorensen, 2001; Hochberg, Ljungqvist & Lu, 2006). Because a serial founder could start companies
with disparate characteristics, investor specialization implies that VCs frequently forgo relational
financing due to suboptimal matching with a founder’s new company.
I test the hypothesis that VC industry specialization leads to discontinued relationships, but
find empirical support only for the subset of VCs that held a board seat in a founder’s previous
company. As a contrast, I find that VC geographical specialization leads to discontinued relationships
5

<-----Page 5----->regardless of the VC held a board seat or not. Increased geographical distance between a serial
founder’s previous and new companies significantly reduces the probability of a repeated relationship.
As an illustration, the probability of a repeated VC relationship is about 12% for a serial founder
whose previous and new companies are located in the same U.S. state as compared with 7% for a
serial founder whose companies are in different U.S. states. Also, this effect is significantly stronger
for a VC that is located close to the founder’s previous company.
The final step of my analysis is to study the involvement of different VCs in a serial founder’s
new company. If the capitalization of information is one of the major motivations behind repeated VC
relationships, then VCs with more information, i.e., relational VCs, should also pursue strong
involvement in a founder’s new company. I test this hypothesis and find that three in four of all
relational VCs invest in the first financing round as compared with less than half of new VCs. A
relational VC is also significantly more likely to hold a board seat in the new company. I find
evidence of “board seat persistence”, i.e. that a relational VC that held a board seat in the founder’s
previous company invests earlier and is more likely to hold a board seat in the new company, as
compared with a relational VC that did not hold a board seat in the founder’s previous company.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews the literature on
relational bank lending and develops a set of hypothesis on the basis of which I test how often and
why financing relationships are repeated. Section III describes how the data is collected and presents
summary statistics. Section IV discusses empirical results related to the average fraction of repeated
relationships, and section V discusses results related to understanding why VCs and serial founders
form repeated relationships. Section VI reviews results related to VC involvement in the founder’s
new company. The paper ends with a brief concluding discussion, in which I consider various other
reasons why relational VC financing is rare in spite of its apparent advantages.

II. Prior Literature and Hypothesis Development
Relational financing has been shown to play an important role in bank lending. Empirical
studies of relationships between banks and small borrowers find that relational lending increases the
6

<-----Page 6----->availability of credit, lowers borrowing costs, and reduces the need for collateral (Berger & Udell,
1995; Petersen & Rajan, 1994, Cole, 1998). Studying relationships between banks and venture-backed
companies, Hellman, Lindsey and Puri (2007) find evidence that relationships are beneficial to
borrowers by lowering loan pricing. Large public companies also benefit from relational lending by
paying lower borrowing costs (Bharath et al, 2007b) and similar results are found for buyout firms
who borrow repeatedly from the same banks (Ivashina & Kovner, 2007). Indirect evidence of the
benefits of banking relationships are found by James (1987) and Lummer and McConnell (1989), who
show that the renewal of bank lending relationships is followed by a positive stock market reaction.
This evidence that relational ties are important in bank lending is not surprising, given that
banks are active intermediaries that specialize in information collection, by means of both preinvestment evaluation and post-investment monitoring (Diamond, 1984, 1991). Because most
company characteristics do not change over time, the information collected by a bank about a
borrower based on past transactions remains relevant to future transactions (Black, 1975; Fama,
1985).
The argument that relational financing is valuable hinges formally on three assumptions. First,
the investor must collect some information about a company in which it is considering making an
investment that is not publicly available (or prohibitively costly to obtain). Second, this information
must be “reusable,” i.e., it must reduce the costs of future transactions between the investor and the
company seeking financing. Third, the benefit of preserving information must be higher than any
costs associated with relational financing. Although VCs are in many important ways functionally
different from banks, the first two assumptions are likely to hold true in venture financing of
entrepreneurial companies.
As investors in early-stage high-growth companies that typically operate in undeveloped
industries, VCs are forced to spend considerable time and resources performing due diligence with
respect to potential investment targets. One important part of this pre-investment screening is
evaluating the quality of a company’s founders (Kaplan & Strömberg, 2004; Bengtsson et al 2005).
VCs also seek information about company founder.s from active post-investment monitoring of
7

<-----Page 7----->portfolio companies—VC executives sit on boards of directors and meet regularly with company
founders and their management teams (Gorman & Sahlman, 1989; Hellmann & Puri, 2002;
Wongsunwai, 2007). These activities provide VCs with significant information about a company and
its founders—VCs therefore clearly satisfy the first assumption needed for relational financing to be
important.
The second assumption needed is that the information that VCs collect about a founder
remains relevant when this founder starts a new company. For this to hold true, the general talent of
founders—not their company-specific skillsets—must be important to the success of a venture-backed
company. VCs typically rank founders as the most important input, and statements like “We would
rather invest in an A-level management team with a B-level idea than in a B-level management team
with an A-level idea” are commonplace in the VC industry. Hsu (2007) shows that previous
experience on the part of a founder is important in the VC valuation of a company. The most direct
evidence that founder quality matters is found in Gompers et al (2007a). Companies started by serial
founders whose previous companies were successful are significantly more likely to become
successful than companies started by other founders. Given the importance of founders, then, it is
likely that a VC’s proprietary information about a founder remains valuable when this founder starts a
new company as well.
From the preceding discussion it follows that, if information is one of the main drivers behind
repeated relationships between VCs and serial founders, then we would expect such relationships to
be more common when a VC has collected more information about a founder. Active involvement on
the part of VCs generates proprietary information that increases the value of relational financing.
Thus, repeated relationships should be more common among VCs that have been more actively
involved in a founder’s previous company.
Hypothesis 1. A repeated relationship between a VC and a serial founder is more likely to occur the
stronger is the involvement the VC has had with the founder’s previous company.
The information that VCs collect about founders is more relevant and thereby more reusable
if a shorter amount of time has elapsed before the founder starts a new company. There are two
8

<-----Page 8----->reasons for the time decay of information value. First, executives in a VC firm are more likely to
remember information acquired in more recent meetings and other exchanges with a founder. Second,
if a founder’s talent improves or deteriorates over time (due to new work or life experiences) then
information about the founder becomes less accurate over time.
Hypothesis 2. A repeated relationship between a VC and a serial founder is more likely to occur the
more recent is the VC’s involvement with the founder.
A typical founder is likely to have many VC investors investing in his company; most
venture-backed companies receive more than one investment round and a large fraction of investment
rounds are syndicated. While each VC could collect some specific information about the founder, the
information held collectively by all the VCs that invest in a company is likely to overlap significantly.
Such information overlap implies that the marginal reusability value of information declines with the
number of repeated transactions. This argument suggests that a serial founder with fewer possible
relationships should be more likely to repeat a particular VC relationship. Importantly, this prediction
has been empirically validated for banks—Ongena and Smith (2001) find that firms that maintain
multiple-bank relationships are more likely to end a bank relationship than single-bank firms are.
Hypothesis 3. A repeated relationship between a VC and a serial founder is more likely to occur the
fewer investors the founder has had.
The third assumption on which the claim that relational financing is valuable is based is that
the associated costs have to be lower than the value of preserving information. My study has an
advantage in focusing on relational financing between companies and not within a company, namely
that this strategy limits the number of possible types of costs involved. For example, repeated
relationships of the types studied in this paper are not likely to end because a VC would want to
diversify its portfolio by minimizing its risk exposure in any given company or because of conflicts
between different VC investors within a company. Similarly, relationships are not likely to continue
because VCs want to salvage previous investment rounds or maintain a controlling stake in a
company.

9

<-----Page 9----->Investing in a serial founder on the part of the same VC does however come at a clear
potential cost—suboptimal matching between a VC and the serial founder’s new company. A VC
must do careful due diligence and engage in post-investment monitoring, and must therefore have a
good understanding of the industry in which a portfolio company operates. As a result, most VCs
restrict their investments to one industry segment (Sorensen & Stuart, 2001), and such specialization
improves the probability of successful company outcomes (Gompers et al, 2007b). When a founder
starts his previous company he chooses VC investors that specialize in that company’s industry
segment. When that same founder subsequently launches a new company in a different industry
segment, the previous VC investors are unlikely to find a similarly optimal match with the founder’s
new company. Thus suboptimal industry matching represents a potential cost of a repeated
relationship between the VC and the serial founder.
Hypothesis 4a. A repeated relationship between a VC and a serial founder is more likely to occur if
both companies founded by the founder are in the same industry segment.
The above argument could be extended to geography; VCs typically focus their investments
in geographical areas (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992; Norton & Tenenbaum, 1993; Sorensen & Stuart,
2001; and Hochberg, Ljungqvist & Lu, 2006). When a founder starts his previous company he
chooses VC investors that specialize in that company’s location. When that same founder
subsequently launches a new company in a different location, the previous VC investors are again
unlikely to have an optimal match with the founder’s new company. Thus suboptimal geography
matching represents a potential cost of a repeated relationship between the VC and the serial founder.1
Hypothesis 4b. A repeated relationship between a VC and a serial founder is more likely to occur if
both companies founded by the founder are geographically close to one another.
The hypotheses I have offered so far make predictions about when a VC should be more
likely to engage in relational financing. The following two hypotheses relate to the financing of the
founder’s new company. If repeated VC relationships are motivated by the value of preserving and

1

Hypotheses 4a and 4b could also be motivated on the grounds that the VC’s information about a serial founder
is more valuable if his new company has similar characteristics as his previous company.
10

<-----Page 10----->capitalizing on information about a founder, then the financing of the founder’s new company should
be structured so that as much information as possible can be reused. This could be achieved by
choosing a relationship VC (i.e. a VC that also invested in the founder’s previous company) that is
more involved in the founder’s new company as compared with other VCs, which are by comparison
more uninformed. Put differently, if a relationship VC takes the role of a passive investor in the new
company then less information is reused because the VC is not actively screening, monitoring, and in
other ways interacting with the founder.
Hypothesis 5. A VC in a repeated relationship with a serial founder should be more involved in the
founder’s new company as compared with other VCs.
The argument that VC investments should be structured so that information about a founder
can be capitalized on implies persistence in VC involvement with the founder’s companies. A VC that
was more involved in the founder’s previous company has more valuable information about the
founder. As such, a VC that was more involved should not only be more likely to have a repeated
relationship, as stated by Hypothesis 1, but also should be more involved in the founder’s new
company.
Hypothesis 6. A VC that was more involved in a serial founder’s previous company should be more
involved in the founder’s new company as compared with a VC that was less involved in the founder’s
previous company.

III. The Data
A. Serial Founders and Company Pairs
While a number of database providers collect information about VC firms, portfolio
companies, and investment rounds, there exists no comprehensive publicly available dataset on
founders. The sample of serial founders used in this paper is hand-collected, as follows. First, I extract
a list of all individuals who are listed as founders of U.S. venture-backed companies in either VentureEconomics (also called VentureXpert) or CapitalIQ, both of which are databases with extensive

11

<-----Page 11----->coverage of venture-backed companies.2 As shown in Table 1, Panel A, this initial sample consists of
9,385 founders. Second, I run an extensive search for the vitae of each of these 9,385 founders, using
CapitalIQ, Zoominfo, Lexis-Nexis, company Web pages, and press releases. Based on the information
in the vitae I eliminate any founder who is either an employee or an entrepreneur-in-residence of a VC
firm. Third, I eliminate all founders who, according to their vitae, are one-time founders, which I
define as individuals who have founded only one venture-backed company.3 To be counted as a
venture-backed company in my sample, the company must be located in the U.S. and be operating at
an early or expansion stage at the time of its first VC investment round (this restriction eliminates
mezzanine and buyout deals). I exclude companies for which neither company nor VC variables are
available in VentureEconomics. At least one of a company’s first round VC investors must be
identified by name. The elimination of serial founders for whom VentureEconomics lacks relevant
data at the time is likely to affect the sample randomly and should not bias my empirical results.
Finally, I eliminate any serial founder whose two companies were founded more than 10 years apart
because repeated relationships are likely to be less relevant over such long intervals of time.4
<< INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE >>
Gompers et al (2007a) also use a hand-collected sample of one-time and serial founders to
study whether entrepreneurial talent matters to the success of startup companies. My sample differs
from theirs in two ways. I extract my founder data from VentureEconomics and CapitalIQ, whereas
Gompers et al use data from VentureSource. My sample also includes founders whose companies
were founded after 2001.
Table 1, Panel B summarizes the sample. The final sample includes 637 individuals, a
majority of which (81%) have founded exactly two companies. The main unit of observation
throughout this paper is a company pair for a serial founder, with each pair consisting of two

2

An earlier and substantially different version of this paper, “Repeated Relationships between Venture
Capitalists and Entrepreneurs,” relied on a different sample from VentureEconomics that also included nonfounding entrepreneurs.
3
Some one-time founders may have founded more than one non-venture-backed company but they are excluded
from my sample because they cannot have repeated VC relationships.
4
All empirical results still hold if I eliminate this restriction.
12

<-----Page 12----->companies that were sequentially started by the same founder. A founder of exactly two companies
has one company pair. A founder of exactly three companies has two company pairs, with the first
company pair including the founder’s first and second companies and the second company pair
including the founder’s second and third companies. For each company pair I denote the founder’s
first company as the “previous company” and the founder’s second company as the “new company.”
My sample combines all company pairs and I include the sequential order of each member of a
company pair as a control variable in empirical tests. The total number of company pairs is 776.
As shown in Table 1, Panel C, the majority of all companies are in life-science-related
industries with headquarters in California.5 Figure 1 shows the distribution of company pairs by the
year of the first VC investment round. Most previous companies are confined to the pre-2001 period,
suggesting a potentially significant overlap between my sample and that of Gompers et al (2007a).
Figure 2 shows the distribution of company pairs by the difference in years between the first and new
companies. A serial founder waits, on average, 4.4 years between the first financing round of his
previous company and that of his new company, but as seen in Figure 2 there is in this respect
significant variation among founders.
<< INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE >>
<< INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE >>

B. VC Investments
For each company pair, I extract data from VentureEconomics data on all VCs that invested
in either the founder’s previous company or his new company. I restrict the sample to VCs that are
identified by name. Also, for the previous company I include only VCs that invested prior to the first
round of the founder’s new company. By imposing this restriction I limit my study to relationships
that repeat from the previous to the new company. VC firms that invest in many rounds for the same
company are included as one observation with VC variables reflecting the VC’s first investment in the
company.

5

Life sciences include biotechnology and the medical/health industries.
13

<-----Page 13----->My final sample includes 3,540 VC investments in the founder’s new company and 3,790 VC
investments in the founder’s previous company. One trivial reason that sometimes explains why serial
founders do not have repeated relationships with a particular VC is that the VC did not actively invest
at the time of the first round of the founder’s new company. I define the VC as an inactive investor if
it made no investment during or after the first round of the founder’s new company. The majority of
VCs (3,356 or 89%) are still active investors in the old company when the founder starts his new
company. Because an inactive VC cannot by definition have a repeated relationship, I exclude such
VC investments from the sample used in empirical tests.

C. Summary Statistics Company Level
Summary statistics are shown in Table 2. Panel A reports company variables with one
observation being one company pair. The figure indicating VC investors in all investment rounds
(“Number of VC Investors”) for the average previous company is almost 5 unique investors, of which
about 2 are investors in the first round (“Number of First Round VC Investors”). The figures
pertaining to the new company are of similar magnitude.
<< INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE >>
One key dimension of a VC investment is the industry in which the new company operates.
The new company of a serial founder could be in either the same industry or the same geographical
area as his previous company. I use the VentureEconomics 9-level industry segment classification and
also construct a 3-level industry segment classification, with “Biotechnology” and ”Medical/Health”
labeled as “Life Science”; ”Computer Hardware,” ”Computer Software,” ”Internet Specific,” and
”Semiconductors/Other” labeled as “High-Tech”; and “Other Products,” “Industrial/Energy,”
“Consumer Related,” and “Communications and Media” labeled as “Other.” I find that 72% of all
company pairs are in the same 3-level industry segments.6 Another key dimension of VC investment
is geography. I use zip-code data to locate the headquarters of each company and then compare the
6

Only 42% of founder involvements are in the same industry if the VentureEconomics 9-level segment
classification is used. This result suggests that the 9-level segment classification is too narrow to define an actual
industry segment in which most founders operate. I therefore use the 3-level segment classification in most of
my empirical tests.
14

<-----Page 14----->locations of a founder’s previous company and that of his new company. I find that 76% of all
company pairs are in the same U.S. state and 25% are in the same city. From zip-code data I calculate
the actual distance between the two companies, which on average is 641 kilometers (398 English
miles).

D. Summary Statistics VC Level
Variables describing VC characteristics are reported in Panel B on the “VC Involvement”
level, where one observation equals one VC investor in a company pair. Typically one or a few VCs
in a financing round take the role of lead investors and become the most involved investors in the
company. VentureEconomics does not identify whether a VC is a lead investor but has data on which
VCs hold board seats. For each VC and company I let the dummy “Board Seat” capture whether a VC
also sits in a board seat. In the founder’s previous company, 12% of VCs are reported to hold a board
seat while this number is 46% for the founder’s new company. The difference in board fractions
between previous and new companies reflects the improved sample coverage in VentureEconomics
for later sample years. All regressions control for this sample coverage effect by including year-fixed
effects (and also state- and industry-fixed effects).

IV. Empirical Results on the Average Fraction of Repeated Relationships
I examine how common, on average, are repeated financing relationships between VCs and
serial founders. I create a set of dummy variables for each company pair that captures whether the
same VC invests in both the founder’s previous and new companies. A venture-backed company
typically conducts many investment rounds, and a repeated relationship could be established either
between first-round VCs or between VCs that invested in any round. Table 3 reports for each panel
three different statistics for repeated relationships: (i) any round VC – any round VC, (ii) any round
VC – first round VC, and (iii) first round VC – first round VC.
<< INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE >>

15

<-----Page 15----->A. VC Level
I first calculate the probability that a particular VC has a repeated relationship. As shown in
Panel A, I find that 9% of VCs investing in any round in a founder’s previous company are also
investors in any round in the new company, and 7% are investors in the first round in the new
company. Restricting the sample to VCs that were investors in the first round (and possibly also in
later rounds), repeated relationships are only slightly more common, as 11% of all VCs are also
investors in the first round in the new company. Panel B reports the same probabilities but excludes
VCs that were not active investors at the time of the financing of the new company. Because 89% of
all VCs are active, the average fractions reported in Panel B are similar to those reported in Panel A—
around 11% of any-round VCs engage in a repeated relationship as well as 8% of first-round VCs.
From this I conclude that repeated relationships are uncommon even for VCs that, by virtue of still
being active investors, could have invested in the founder’s new company.
Panel C reports the probability that a particular VC that invests in a serial founder’s new
company was also an investor in the same founder’s previous company. Of all the VCs that invest in
any round in the founder’s new company, only 10% are repeated-relationship VCs. The fraction is
larger for first-round investors in the new company, of which 18% engage in a repeated relationship.

B. Company Pair Level
A company could have multiple VCs as investors, either because a first round is syndicated or
because new VCs join in subsequent rounds. Panel D reports the probability that any VC in a given
company pair has a repeated relationship with a serial founder. Because each company could have
many VCs (the average is 4.9 for the previous company), this probability will be higher,
mechanically, than the probability that a particular VC engages in a repeated relationship. I find that
33% of all company pairs engage in a repeated relationship with any VC. The probability that any
previous-involvement VC is also a first-round investor in the new company is 27%. Studying only
first-round VCs, I find that 18% of all founder involvements have the same VC investing in the first
round of both company involvements. Some companies have more than one serial founder. Panel E

16

<-----Page 16----->reports the probabilities that any founder will engage in a repeated relationship with any VC. I find
that, for the average company, 37% of all VCs engage in a repeated relationship (any round – any
round) and 20% of all first-round VCs are also investors in the first round in the new company.

C. Comparison to Relational Bank Lending
While it is hard to make an exact comparison when different financing situations are involved,
the calculated probabilities for VC relational financing is clearly lower than what other studies have
found for relational lending on the part of lead banks. Radhakrishnan, Udell, and Yerramill (2007)
report that 42% of all loans to CompuStat firms originate from a lead bank that has previously
financed the same company. Similar results are found in two papers by Bharath et al (2007a,
2007b)—a bank with a previous relational tie has a 42% probability of being chosen to provide a new
loan, and 52% of all loans include a lead bank with a relational tie. It is worth noting that these three
papers construct measures of bank relationships only within the DealScan database. Because many
loans are not reported in DealScan, the reported fractions of repeated bank lending, as acknowledged
by the authors, are therefore understated.
In the next section I explore whether the tradeoff between preserving information and
achieving an optimal matching could explain why relational VC financing is so uncommon. The
concluding discussion (section VII) covers other potential explanations.

V. Empirical Results on the Cross-Section of Repeated Relationships
In this section I discuss results related to Hypotheses 1-4, all of which make predictions about
when a particular VC that invests in a founder’s previous company should be more likely also to
invest in the founder’s new company. In Table 4 I compare the probability of a repeated VC
relationship for different subsamples, with Panel A showing the results for my broadest empirical
measure of repeated relationship, “any round VC – any round VC”, and Panel B the results for my
most narrow measure, “any round VC – first round VC.”
<< INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE >>

17

<-----Page 17----->While a univariate comparison is illustrative, it does not separate out the marginal effect of
each variable. To do this I run a series of multivariate probit regressions using the sample of 3,356
previous company investments by VCs that are still active at the time of the first round of the
founder’s new company. All models adjust standard errors for cross-correlation by clustering
residuals by previous-involvement company, and the coefficient estimates are adjusted to reflect the
marginal effects.7
<< INSERT TABLE 5A ABOUT HERE >>
<< INSERT TABLE 5B ABOUT HERE >>
Table 5A shows the results for regressions in which the dependent variable is a dummy that
takes the value 1 if any previous-involvement VC also invests in any round of the new involvement
(“any round VC – any round VC”). This is my primary measure of relational financing. Table 5B is
identical to Table 5A except that the dependent variable is a dummy capturing whether any previousinvolvement VC also invests in the first round of the new involvement (“any round VC – first round
VC”). Because the results shown in Table 5A and Table 5B are qualitatively very similar, I focus
most of my discussion on the results found in Table 5A, which uses my broadest measure of repeated
relationships.
In order to control for specific market conditions I include year, industry (3-level segment),
and state controls in all regression models. When I explore the unreported coefficents on these control
variables I find that repeated relationships are significantly more common in later sample years and
when the founder’s previous company is located in California. Also, I find that repeated relationships
are less common when the founder’s previous company had an IPO before the founder started his
new company.8 Finally, I also find weak statistical evidence that serial founders who have started

7

The clustering solves the problem that my empirical tests duplicate company-level observations by counting
each company-VC pair as a separate observation. To validate the correct estimation of standard errors, I have, in
unreported regressions, re-estimated company-level coefficients using one company pair as a separate
observation. All reported significant coefficients remain significant in these specifications.
8
An earlier and substantially different version of this paper studied a sample that was collected only from
VentureEconomics and, critically, also included non-founding entrepreneurs. The result that VC relationships
are less common when the previous company had an IPO is significantly stronger for non-founding
entrepreneurs than for founders.
18

<-----Page 18----->more than two companies, i.e., whose company pair sequence is above one, are more likely to have a
repeated VC relationship.

A. Involvement Strength
According to Hypothesis 1, a repeated relationship should be more likely if the VC has a
stronger involvement with the founder’s previous company. I am unable to precisely measure the
involvement by a VC, and VentureEconomics does not identify the lead investor of an investment
round. Instead I use four empirical proxies for involvement strength. One advantage of this indirect
approach is that the proxies are functionally unrelated to each other, and thereby capture different
dimensions of involvement strength.
The first, and probably most convincing, proxy for VC involvement is whether the VC held a
board seat or not. A VC that holds a board seat monitors and interacts with company founders more
frequently than a VC with no board seat. As shown in regression models 5A.I – 5A.V, “VC has Board
Seat” increases the probability of a repeated relationship by 4-5 percentage points, which corresponds
to almost half the unconditional probability of a repeated relationship.
The second proxy is whether the VC is located geographically close to the company’s
headquarters, measured by the dummy variable “VC and Company in Same State.” As shown by
Coval and Moskowitz (2001) and Degryse and Ongena (2005), monitoring and information collection
is likely to decrease with geographical distance. Regression models 5A.I – 5A.V provide evidence that
repeated relationships are more frequent for VCs located close to the company. The coefficient on
“VC and Company in Same State” is statistically significant and its magnitude is similar to that of
“VC has Board Seat.”
The third proxy is the variable “Invested in Early Stage,” which measures whether a VC was
an early-stage investor in the company. The need for monitoring is great when the company is at an
early stage and has yet to realize revenues or profits (or even to create a working product). Early stage
investors can collect more founder information because founder involvement declines over the
company’s lifecycle (Hellman & Puri, 2002; Kaplan, Sensoy & Strömberg, 2007). Models 5A.I –

19

<-----Page 19----->5A.V show supportive, although weakly significant, evidence that VCs that are early-stage investors
are also more likely to have a repeated relationship. In Model 5A.V I use “Round Number of First
Investment” as a different measure of whether the VC was an early investor in the company and find
no significant result.
The fourth proxy for involvement strength factors in the characteristics of the VC. Bottazzi,
Da Rin, and Hellman (2007) show that not all types of VCs are equally involved in a portfolio
company. Compared with a financial, corporate, or government-backed VC, an independent privatepartnership VC is more likely to have frequent interactions with the company, sit on the board of
directors, assist in recruiting external board members and executives, and assist the company with
fundraising. As shown in Models 5A.I – 5A.V, relational financing is more common for privatepartnership VCs—the coefficient on “VC Private Partnership” represents about one-quarter (3
percentage points) of the unconditional probability of a repeated relationship.
I also include “VC Number of Investments Total” in the regression models as a measure of
VC experience. More experienced VCs have been shown to make moresuccessful investments partly
because they add more value to portfolio companies (Sorensen, 2007; Chemmanur, Krishnan &
Nandy, 2007). The process of adding value naturally gives the VC information about the company and
the founders. The estimated coefficients on “VC Number of Investments Total” are positive but small
and not statistically significant. 9
Taken together, the empirical evidence strongly supports Hypothesis 1. The involvement
strength of a VC strongly affects the probability of relational financing. As shown in the univariate
comparison of Table 4, a VC with the maximum involvement, i.e., a private-partnership VC located in
the same state as the company that holds a board seat and is an early-stage investor in the company,
has a 26% probability of a repeated relationship. This is 21 percentage points higher than for a VC
with the minimum involvement, i.e., a non-private-partnership VC located in a different state from
that of the company that does not hold a board seat and is not an early-stage investor in the company.

9

One competing explanation is that partnership VCs and more experienced VCs on average target broader
investment segments and are thereby are more likely to find a good match with the founder’s new company.
20

<-----Page 20----->A VC with minimum involvement has only a 4% probability of being an investor in the founder’s new
company.
My findings show a link between VC involvement strength and repeated relationships.
Because I study relational VC financing between separate venture-backed companies, I can further
interpret my results as evidence of a causal link, where VC involvement strength leads to relational
financing. While I cannot formally prove that no VC chooses to become more involved in a founder’s
previous company as a way to increase the probability of also being selected as an investor in the
same founder’s new company, such a reverse-causality relationship is unlikely. Gompers et al (2007a)
reports that only about 10% of all first-time founders become serial founders (I find a similar fraction
in my sample). The low probability that a founder becomes a serial founder, in combination with the
high volatility surrounding early-stage companies in undeveloped industries, makes it hard for a VC to
predict whether a particular founder will start a new company.10 Furthermore, as shown in this paper,
the probability of a repeated relationship between VCs and a serial founder is about 10%. Taken
together, this means that the joint probability that a founder will be a serial founder and have a
repeated VC relationship is for the average VC approximately about 1%. It is therefore very unlikely
that a VC’s decision to become more involved in a startup company is motivated by an increased
possibility of a future repeated relationship with the same founder. This view is further supported in
interviews with VC executives. In conclusion, the causality of my empirical findings is such that
involvement strength in the founder’s previous company predicts repeated relationship.

B. Recent Involvement
Hypothesis 2 states that a repeated relationship should be more likely if the VC has had a
more recent involvement with the founder. The variable “Years Between Companies” measures the
time between the first round of the founder’s previous company and the new company, respectively.
As shown in regression models 5A.I – 5A.VI, each year between the founding of the companies
10

While one result in Gompers et al (2007a) is that experienced VCs are better at identifying first time founders
who will become serial founders, this finding is probably better explained by a positive matching between
experienced VCs and higher-quality founders who, due to their higher quality, are more likely to start a new
company.
21

<-----Page 21----->decreases the probability of a repeated relationship by 1 percentage point, which is about one-tenth of
the unconditional probability. Importantly, Table 5 includes only VCs that are still active investors
during or after the founder’s new company. In an unreported regression, I also include the square of
“Years between Companies” to test for non-linearity but find no significant results. Notably, as shown
in regression models 5B.I – 5B.V, the coefficient on “Years between Companies” is smaller and not
significant when “any round VC – first round VC” is used as a measure of repeated VC relationships.

C. Number of VCs in Company
As per Hypothesis 3, a particular VC should be more likely to have a repeated relationship
when a founder has had fewer VC investors. In Models 5A.I – 5A.VI, I show that the probability of a
repeated relationship increases by 0.6 percentage points for each VC investor in the founder’s
previous company. This result mimics the findings of Ongena and Smith (2001) that relational
financing for banks is less likely for companies with multiple bank relationships. Even if a serial
founder with a larger number of VC investors has a lower probability of entering into a repeated
relationship with a particular VC, I find in an unreported regression that such a founder also has a
higher probability of entering into a repeated relationship with any VC.

D. Industry Movement
The fact that VCs have some degree of industry specialization could help to explain why
some VC relationships with a serial founder are discontinued. According to Hypothesis 4a, the
probability of a repeated relationship should be lower for a serial founder whose companies are in
different industry segments. As shown in Models 5A.I and 5A.II, the coefficients on either “Same
Industry 3-level” or “Same Industry 9-level” are not significantly different from zero. Thus I do not
find empirical support for Hypothesis 4 when the sample includes all VCs that invested in the
founder’s previous company.

22

<-----Page 22----->E. Geographical Movement
Hypothesis 4b states that the probability of a repeated relationship should be lower for a serial
founder whose companies are geographically separated. As shown in 5A.II, if both of a serial
founder’s companies are headquartered in the same U.S. state (“Same State”), then the probability of
a repeated relationship is about 4 percentage points higher. This corresponds to about half of the
unconditional probability of a repeated relationship. As reported in 5A.IV, if the two companies are in
the “Same City,” then a serial founder is more likely to enter into any repeated relationship by a
margin of 7 percentage points. Similarly, Model 5A.III shows that a doubling of the “Distance in
Kilometers” between a founder’s previous and new companies lowers the probability of a repeated
relationship by 1.3 percentage points. These results are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, which calculate
the average frequency of repeated relationships for different deciles of geographical distance. In
summary, as a contrast to the industry results I find strong evidence that a founder whose first and
new companies are in the same geographical area is significantly more likely to enter into a repeated
relationship.
<< INSERT FIGURES 3 AND 4 ABOUT HERE >>
Hypothesis 4b makes a prediction about the empirical link between relational VC financing
and the geographical distance between a founder’s two companies. This link could be motivated
either by a geographical specialization of the VC that invested in the founder’s previous company, or
alternatively by a geographical specialization of the VC that invested in the founder’s new company.
A serial founder who wants to receive financing from a new VC that is located far from the
headquarters of the founder’s previous company may choose to locate his new company closer to that
VC. While these two explanations at some level different, they both follow from the geographical
specialization of VCs. This means that the interpretation of my results is the same even if the location
of a founder’s new company is endogenously determined.

23

<-----Page 23----->F. Interactions with Geographical Movement
Table 6 expands on the regression models of Table 5 to include interaction variables with
“Same State.” Models 6.I – 6.III show results where “any round VC – any round VC” is the
dependent variable and results where “any round VC – first round VC” is the dependent variable are
reported in models 6.IV – 6.VI. Model 6.I includes an interaction between “Same State” and “Same
Industry 3-level,” which is estimated with an insignificant coefficient. Thus a founder whose two
companies are in different U.S. states and different industries is not less likely to enter into a repeated
VC relationship than a founder whose two companies are in different U.S. states and the same
industry.
<< INSERT TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE >>
In Model 6.II, I interact “VC and Company in Same State” and “Same State” and obtain a
large negative significant coefficient (8 percentage points). Notably, when this interaction variable is
included, the coefficient on “VC and Company in Same State” becomes insignificant. I interpret this
result as follows. A serial founder is overall more likely to receive financing from a VC that is
geographically close to his previous company. If, however, the founder’s new company is located in a
different location from that of his new company, then the proximity between the VC and the new
company is irrelevant to the propensity for there being a repeated relationship.
Finally, I interact “Same State” with “VC Board Seat” to test whether the geographical
distance between a founder’s companies is more important for a VC that is more involved in the
founder’s previous company. As shown in model 6.III, I find no such evidence.

G. VCs with Board Seat
The above tests include the full sample of VCs that invested in the founder’s previous
company, i.e., both the VCs that were actively involved in the company and the more inactive VCs.
Table 7 reports regression models similar to those in Table 5, but with the sample limited to VCs that
held a board seat. Models 7.I – 7.III show results where “any round VC – any round VC” is the

24

<-----Page 24----->dependent variable and the effects of “any round VC – first round VC” are reported in Models 7.IV –
7.VI.
<< INSERT TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE >>
When comparing VCs that held a board seat, the other proxies for the strength of the VC’s
involvement—“VC Private Partnership,” “Invested in Early Stage,” and “VC and Company in Same
State”—are no longer significant. Thus stronger VC involvement, as measured by these proxies,
matters only for VCs that do not hold a board seat. The estimated coefficient on “Years Between
Companies” is large and significant for VCs with a board seat, which supports Hypothesis 2 that the
value of a VC’s information about a founder decays over time. I do not find that repeated
relationships are less likely for companies that received financing from a larger number of investors.
Thus, Hypothesis 3 does not hold for VCs that hold board seats.
Increased geographical distance between the founder’s companies lowers the probability of a
repeated relationship for VCs that hold board seats. The estimated coefficients on “Same State” and
“Distance in Kilometers” are significant and have similar magnitude, relative to the unconditional
probability, as for the full sample of VCs. Interestingly, while the coefficient on “Same Industry 3level” remains insignificant, the coefficient on “Same Industry 9-level” is significant and
economically large (12 percentage points, which is about two-thirds of the unconditional probability).
Hence, a founder whose companies are in different industries is not less likely to receive financing
from a VC that invested in the founder’s previous company, unless that VC held a board seat.

G. Summary of Results
I find strong empirical support for Hypotheses 1 – 3 and 4b. Hypothesis 4a, which states that
industry specialization predicts relational VC financing, is supported only for VCs that hold a board
seat in the founder’s previous company. Overall, the results support the theory that relational
financing by VCs of serial founders is driven by a tradeoff between the preservation of founder
information and optimizing the VC-company matching outcome.

25

<-----Page 25----->The economic importance of information is considerable, which could be illustrated by a
comparison between VC investors with the largest difference in involvement. As presented in Table
4A, the probability of a repeated relationship is 26% for the 152 sample VCs that have the strongest
involvement (a private-partnership VC that holds a board seat, invests in an early stage, and is located
in the same state as the company) and 4% for the 507 sample VCs that have the weakest involvement
(a non-private-partnership VC that does not hold a board seat, invests in later stage, and is located in a
different state as the company). Interestingly, these magnitudes are quantitatively similar to the results
on bank relationships found in Bharath et al (2007a). A bank with a relational tie with the company
has a probability of 42% of providing a new loan to the company, as compared with 3% for a nonrelational bank. Thus, the probabilities of relational financing is about the same for a non-relationship
bank that could provide a follow-up loan to a company than for a non-informed VC that could
financing to a serial founder’s new company.
When also considering the importance of other information aspects and matching between VC
and the founder’s new company, the difference in probabilities of relational VC financing is further
enhanced. The probability of repeated relationship is 67% for the nine sample VCs that have the
strongest involvement (as defined in the above paragraph), that invested in a founder whose previous
company is located in geographical proximity (the bottom quartile of sample distance), is in the same
industry group (9-level), received first-round financing less than four years before his new company,
and had less than seven VCs. The corresponding probability is zero for the 51 sample VCs that had
the weakest involvement and invested in a founder whose previous company is located at a
geographical distance (top quartile), is in a different industry group, received first-round financing
more than three years before his new company, and had more than six VCs.
Although the differences between the above extreme cases is considerable, the lack of
valuable private information and bad matching are unlikely to be the sole reason why 9 out of 10
potential repeated relationships between VCs and serial founders are never formed. Regressions in
Tables 5A and 5B have relatively low pseudo R-squared (between 0.14 and 0.16), which indicates that
other motivations could be important.
26

<-----Page 26----->VI. Empirical Results on VC Involvement in the New Company
The empirical validation of Hypotheses 1 – 3 shows that relational VC financing is motivated
by the value of preserving and capitalizing on information about a founder. From this follows the
empirical expectation that VCs with more information should take a more active role in the founder’s
new company, so they can best capitalize on the information. The final step in my empirical analysis
is to test Hypotheses 5 and 6, which both make predictions about how repeated relationships affect
VC involvement in a founder’s new company. I study two different dimensions of a VC’s
involvement—the stage of the company at which the VC makes its first investment and whether the
VC holds a board seat.

A. VC Investment Stage
Table 8 shows the results of a univariate comparison of VC involvement. Panel A compares
the investment stage for VCs that also invested in the founder’s previous company (“Repeated VCs”)
and other VCs (“New VCs”). I find differences of great magnitude. While 76% of all investments by
repeated VCs are in the company’s first financing round, the same fraction for new VCs is only 43%.
Panel B compares the investment stage for repeated VCs that hold a board seat in the previous
company with repeated VCs that do not hold a board seat in the previous company. Fully 94% of
repeated VCs with a previous board seat invest in the first financing round of the new company, as
compared with 76% of repeated VCs with no previous board seat. This pattern is also found in the
multivariate regressions that are reported in Table 9. Controlling for VC and company characteristics,
regression Models 9.I – 9.VI validate the findings of the univariate comparisons.
<< INSERT TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE >>
<< INSERT TABLE 9 ABOUT HERE >>

B. Board Seat
Panels C and D report results of a univariate comparison of the fraction of VCs that hold a
board seat in the founder’s new company. As shown in Panel C, repeated VCs are more likely than
new VCs to hold a board seat in the founder’s new company. Panel D compares this fraction between
27

<-----Page 27----->repeated VCs with a board seat in the founder’s new company with other repeated VCs. I find strong
evidence of “board seat persistence” for repeated VCs—a board seat in the new company is more than
twice as common (70% versus 31%) for VCs that also had a board seat in the previous company. The
univariate results are verified in multivariate regressions that are reported in Table 10. Controlling for
VC and company characteristics, board seats are more common for repeated VCs and particularly for
repeated VCs with a board seat in the founder’s previous company.
<< INSERT TABLE 10 ABOUT HERE >>

C. Summary of Results
The results reported in Tables 8 – 10 provide overall support for Hypothesis 5, which states
that a VC that has a repeated relationship should be more involved in the founder’s new company as
compared with other VCs. Repeated VCs invest earlier than other VCs and are more likely to hold a
board seat in the founder’s new company. I also find empirical support for Hypothesis 6, which states
that a VC that is more involved in a serial founder’s previous company should be more involved in the
founder’s new company as compared with a VC that is less involved in the founder’s previous
company. Repeated VCs that hold a board seat in the founder’s previous company are found to invest
earlier and be more likely to hold a board seat, as compared with repeated VCs that do not hold a
board seat.
Overall, the empirical validation of Hypotheses 5 and 6 adds further support to the assertion
that the value of preserving and capitalizing on information is a major motivation explaining why VCs
engage in relational financing with serial founders.

VII. Concluding Discussion
The findings of this paper reveal that VCs, despite being very active investors, frequently
discontinue relationships with serial founders. I test and find supportive evidence for two motivations
to explain why a founder or a VC chooses not to engage in relational financing. The first motivation
is that the VC’s involvement in a founder’s previous company was not very strong and thereby did

28

<-----Page 28----->not give the VC any valuable proprietary information about the founder. The second motivation is
related to the geographical, and to some extent industry, specialization of VCs—a founder who
moves to a new geographical area or industry is likely to have a suboptimal match with his previous
investors. While information preservation and matching are found to have strong predictive power
with respect to repeated relationships, these two motivations are unlikely to be the sole reasons why
so many VC relationships are not continued.
Another possible motivation is that a serial founder “moves up the ladder” by choosing new
VCs that are more reputable or experienced than the VCs that invested in his previous company. This
motivation has been empirically shown to be an important explanation why borrowers end
relationships with banks (Radhakrishnan, Udell & Yerramilli, 2007) and why companies end
relationships with underwriters (Krigman, Shaw & Womack, 2001). A serial founder may also end
VC relationships because increased exposure in the marketplace has allowed him to expand his
network and make contact with a large number of new VC investors. Indirect evidence for this
motivation is found by Hsu (2007), who shows that a serial founder is more likely to raise financing
from a VC with whom the founder has a personal connection. Another possibility is that relationships
end because VCs, many of which operate only one or two funds at a given time, do not have available
capital when the founder seeks financing for his company.
Finally, there are possible behavioral reasons why serial founders choose not to receive
financing from their previous VC investors. Interviewed VC executives have explained to me that VC
investments frequently lead to frictions or “bad blood” with founders (VCs are sometimes referred to
as “vulture capitalists”). Founders often feel strong emotional attachment to their ideas and products,
and dislike the way VCs demand strong control rights in return for their capital. VCs sometimes force
a founder to step down as CEO (Hellman & Puri, 2000; Kaplan, Sensoy & Strömberg, 2007). Recent
empirical evidence also suggests that, while VCs appear to be patient investors during the initial years
of a company’s operations, the failure rate after five years is higher for venture-backed companies
than for non-venture-backed companies (Puri & Zarutskie, 2007).

<-----Page 32----->Table 1 - Sample Overview
Sample is individuals who are listed in either CapitalIQ or VentureXpert as founder of a U.S. VC-backed
company. I exclude any founder who is affiliated with a VC firm, either as a firm employee or as entrepreneurin-residence. Serial founders are founders who have founded at least two VC-backed US companies that are
included in the VentureXpert database. A company pair for a serial founder is defined as a pair of the founder's
previous and new companies. Thus a founder of 3 companies has two company pairs, the first pair capturing the
1st and 2nd companies and the second pair capturing the 2nd and 3rd companies. I exclude company pairs that
occur with more than 10 years apart. The industry segments are based on the VentureXpert classification with
"Biotechnology" and "Medical/Health" labelled as Life Science, and "Computer Hardware", "Computer
Software", "Internet Specific" and "Semiconductors/Other" labelled as "High-Tech" and "Other Products",
"Industrial/Energy", "Consumer Related" and "Communications and Media" labelled as Other. The state refers
to the location of the company's headquarters.

<-----Page 34----->Table 2 - Summary Statistics on Company and VC Characteristics
See Table 1 for sample description. Company and VC characteristics data from VentureXpert. In "Company Pair Level" one observation is one company-founder pair
(i.e. some companies are counted multiple times if having more than one serial founder, and some founders are counted multiple times if having founded more than 2
companies). Company Outcome (IPO/merger) and Number of VC Investors for previous involvement refers to outcome prior to the first round of the new company
involvement. Early Stage is a dummy equal to 1 if company was at early stage at time of first VC round, and 0 otherwise. Years Between Companies is the difference
between the years of the first VC round for the founder's previous and new company. In "VC Involvement Level" one observation is one VC that invested in a serial
founder's previous and new company involvements respectively (i.e. some VCs are counted multiple times if involved in different companies). The experience variables
Age and Number of Investments reflect the VC experience prior to the VC's involvement in the company. Active Investor is a dummy equal to 1 if the VC was an active
investor at the new company involvement, and 0 otherwise.

See Table 1 for sample description. In Panels A and B one observation is one VC that invested in a serial founder's
previous company. These panels captures the probability that a particular previous VC has a repeated relationship
with a serial founder. In Panel C one observation is one VC that invested in a serial founder's new company. This
panel captures the probability that a particular new VC comes from a repeated relationship with a serial founder. In
Panel D one observation is one company involvement of a serial founder. This panel captures the probability that a
serial founder has a repeated relationship with any previous VC. In Panel E, all founder data is aggregated to
company-level and one observation is one company. This panel captures the probability that any VC that invested in
the company has a repeated relationship with any founder.

See Table 1 for sample description. One observation is one VC involvement in a serial founder's previous company. Panel
A captures the probability that a particular previous VC has a repeated relationship with a serial founder in any round of
the founder's new company. Panel B captures the probability that a particular previous VC has a repeated relationship
with a serial founder in the first round of the founder's new company. Sample for Max Involvement=Yes is private
partnership VCs that hold a board seat, are located in the same state as the company and invested in an early stage.
Sample for Max Involvement=No is non-private partnership VCs that do not hold a board seat, are located in a different
state as the company and did not invest in an early stage. Short distance is when the distance between company and VC is
in the lowest sample quartile. Statistical significance for Chi-squared test marked with * at 10%; ** at 5% and *** at 1%.

See Table 1 for sample description. One observation is one VC involvement in serial founder's new company. Panel A tests
whether a repeated VC vs. a new VC invests earlier in a founder's new company. Panel B tests whether a repeated VC with a
board seat in the founder's previous company vs. a repeated VC without a board seat in the founder's previous company
invest earlier in a founder's new company. Panel C tests whether a repeated VC vs. new VCs is more likely to have a board
seat in the founder's new company. Panel D tests whether a repeated VC with a board seat in the founder's previous
company vs. a repeated VC without a board seat in the founder's previous company is more likely to have a board seat in the
founder's new company. Statistical significance for Chi-squared (Chi2) test and Kruska-Waillis test (K-W) marked with * at
