Universities have been considered to be more adept at development of technology
rather than moving it into commercial applications. However, during the last two
decades, universities across North America (US and Canada in this context) have
exhibited tremendous success in licensing their research results for commercial
application. An increasing number of universities are defining their institutional
objectives in terms of identifying, creating and commercializing intellectual property
(IP) being created on their campuses. Fuelled by the notion that smooth interactions
between universities and industry are important for the success of innovation
activities and ultimate economic growth, university industry linkages (UIL) have
become a central concern for government policy across the globe. Universities
have attempted to formalize university industry technology transfer (UITT) by
establishing technology transfer offices (TTOs). Traditionally, TTOs have facilitated
university technology commercialization (UTC) through the licensing to industry
of inventions or IP resulting from university research and (more recently) by
supporting the creation of university spin offs (USOs). Creation of a TTO within
the university is often viewed as instrumental to secure a sufficient level of autonomy
for developing relations with industry. A higher degree of financial and managerial
independence further facilitates relations with third parties, such as venture
capitalists, investment bankers and patent attorneys. A dedicated TTO also allows
for specialization in supporting services, most notably management of IP and
business development. In this paper, we take a look at the established UTC process,
the benefits of UTC, the role of TTOs in UTC and the state of research on UTC in
North America. A debate about the role of the TTOs is also initiated. Through a
case study of the Carleton University Foundry program, this paper discusses the
model for a non traditional university technology transfer program developed in
Carleton University and highlights how this program, through its unique structure
and its support for innovation has been highly successful in stimulating the transfer
of research and technologies from Carleton University into commercial applications.

INTRODUCTION

U

niversities as engines of economic growth, via the commer
cialization of university generated intellectual property (IP) have
captured the attention of University administrators and
policymakers all over the world (Bozeman, 2000; Crow & Nath, 1992;

<-----Page 1----->110 Role of University Technology
Lederman, 1994; Licht & Narlinger, 1998; Poyago-Theotoky et al., 2002).
Accordingly, the generation and exploitation of IP has become a central
issue not only for the universities but it is also a major driver for government
policy, especially in North America (Bertha, 1996; Bozeman, 2000;
Papakadis, 1992; Rahm, 1992). It is being increasingly accepted that the
successful creation and commercialization of university originated
technology can lead to gains that stretch beyond the immediate financial
gains for the university (DeVol, 1999; Fisher, 1998; Jaffe, 1989; Jaffe et
al., 1993; Shane & Stuart, 2002; Slaughter & Leslie, 1997; Zucker et al.,
1998). The emergence of the knowledge based economy, an economy in
which production, use and distribution of information and knowledge have
become central to economic development, has given a further impetus to
this trend. As captured by David (1997: 4), “the universities are not just a
creator of knowledge, a trainer of young minds and a transmitter of culture,
but also a major agent for economic growth: the knowledge factory, as it
were at the center of knowledge economy”.
Post World War II North America saw a dramatic expansion in the
higher education sector as well as in public research funding allocations
to the institutions in this sector. This generated substantial increases in
the scientific and research output coming out of the universities. The
massive investments in basic research were driven by the vision of
long term economic and social benefits and, to achieve this, the
universities were given a lot of autonomy in the conduct of their research
activities. The underlying expectation was that while the basic research
on the university campuses will be conducted without any
commercialization agendas, the discoveries coming out the university
research would create possibilities of potential applications, to be
pursued by industry through applied research, development, design,
production and marketing. This rudimentary interaction between the
universities and the industry, initially through the postwar US
government science policy, was the basis for the initial university
industry linkages (UIL) which in turn helped spawn the modern day
field of university industry technology transfer (UITT) (Brooks, 1996;
Stokes, 1997).
The last two decades have seen increased demands on the
universities across North America to supplement their basic research
with more applied research so that there is a greater translation of
university based research into commercializable results. This shift is
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 2----->111 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
attributed to a number of factors such as; i) increase in interdisciplinary
research, ii) a shift in the government funding from basic to more applied
research, iii) the linking of the government funding for academic research
and economic policy, iv) the development of strategic long term relationships
between industry and university researchers, v) the increasing direct
participation of universities in commercializing research (Etzkowitz &
Webster, 1998; Poyago-Theotoky et al., 2002). As a result, universities
across North America are proactively pursuing university technology
commercialization (UTC) agendas by setting up their own technology
transfer offices (TTOs), a move that has been widely supported by
government through legislation as well as policy development (Bertha,
1996; Bozeman, 2000; Poyago-Theotoky et al., 2002). UTC, in the context
of this paper, refers to the ‘process whereby inventions or IP from academic
research is licensed or conveyed through use of rights to a for profit entity
and eventually commercialized’ (Friedman & Silberman, 2003) while a
TTO refers to ‘a unit within the university, not a corporation or an entity
separated from the university created specifically for the purpose of
technology commercialization’ (Carlsson & Fridh, 2002).
Of all the initiatives credited with the rapid ascent of UTC and its
recognition as a major North American innovation policy directive,
none has received more attention than the Bayh-Dole Act, enacted by
the U.S. government in July 1980 (Mowery et al., 2001). The underlying
motive behind this legislation was to unify 26 separate statutes that
governed the ownership of patents arising out of government sponsored
research. The act transferred the rights to IP generated under federal
funding from the funding agencies to the universities, thus providing
the latter with the opportunities to commercialize their research. The
Bayh-Dole act resulted in a significant decrease in the difficulties faced
by universities and small businesses seeking to retain the ownership of
the technology developed with federal research money. The BayhDole act is often credited with the significant increase in the university
patenting and licensing activity 1 during the last two decades as it
essentially clarified the nature of the processes that need to be in place
to bring university technology into the marketplace (Sandelin, 1994).
The sudden surge in the creation of TTOs2, during the last two decades,
to market and manage the patentable inventions coming out of the
universities across North America is also attributed to the successful
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 3----->112 Role of University Technology
enactment of the Bayh-Dole act (Allan, 2001; Hsu & Bernstein, 1997;
Rogers et al., 2000).
Not all researchers completely agree with these observations, for
example, Henderson et al. (1998) suggest that while the Bayh-Dole
act may have influenced the propensity to patent, it has not resulted in
any fundamental shifts in the underlying generation of commercially
significant inventions in the universities. Colyvas et al. (2002) also
insist that the dramatic increase in patenting post Bayh-Dole act can
not be simply attributed to the passing of the act alone, since other
factors such as the maturing of new research areas like molecular
biology, microelectronics also contributed to this significant shift. On
a different note, Mowery & Sampat (2005) say that Bayh-Dole act
may actually have had a negative influence on the academic researchers
commitment to open science by making them hold back their results.
However, there does seem to be a general consensus on the fact that
Bayh-Dole act may have provided a further impetus to the UTC which
according to a majority of researchers already existed in some form or
another. The disagreements about its impact notwithstanding, the BayhDole act is widely considered as one of the most successful pieces of
economic development and job creation legislation in recent human
history. The extent of its influence on UTC is reflected in the fact that
while the enactment of the act took place in the US, it has formed a
basis for similar policy development across the whole world and is
widely treated as the defacto technology transfer legislation in the UTC
literature (Jamison, 1999; Mowery & Sampat, 2005).
University Industry Technology Transfer, University Technology
Commercialization and the Role of Technology Transfer Offices
Universities have always been at the forefront of new technology
development (Barker, 1985; Jaffe, 1989; Hall et al., 2003). More recent
developments such as an increasing number of strategic partnerships/
relationships with industry (Link, 1996; Siegel et al., 2003b), significant
increase in the technology licensing arrangements (Thursby & Thursby,
2002), a marked rise in the number of university spin-offs (USOs) (Di
Gregorio & Shane, 2003), the emergence of technology clusters and
science parks around universities (Felsenstein, 1994; Wolfe, 2002) and
the emergence of highly successful economic zones, such as the Silicon

<-----Page 4----->113 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
Valley, RTP in North Carolina and Route 128, around prominent universities
(Fisher, 1998; Gibbons, 2000; Roberts & Malone, 1996; Saxenian, 1996;
Shane & Stuart, 2002) have firmly positioned the universities at the center
of commercial technology development3.
UITT can occur in many different forms (Upstill & Symington,
2002), for example, through the publication of research results in
scientific journals, books and articles, through industry sponsored
research, through strategic research partnerships between universities
and industries etc. As highlighted by a number of authors (such as
Parker & Zilberman, 1993; Parker et al., 1998; Thursby et al., 2001),
the transfer of technology from a university setting to industry is not a
discreet event but comprises of a number of distinct stages. Even as
the policies and procedures governing the UITT differ from one
university to another, the basic processes seem to be quite similar
(Friedman & Silberman, 2003; Graff et al., 2002; Rogers et al., 2000).
Upstill & Symington (2002) have identified three principal modes of
technology transfer from public research agencies, namely; non
commercial transfer (mode I), commercial transfer (mode II) and the
new company generation (mode III). The same model, with very little
modification, can be used to show the different modes/mechanisms of
UITT (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Different modes of University Industry Technology Transfer

Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 5----->114 Role of University Technology
Mode I UITT, i.e. the non commercial transfer is non contractual and is
primarily through the dissemination of IP/knowledge through academic
routes such as seminars, conferences, research publications etc. UITT
in mode II, i.e. the commercial transfer has formal commercial
agreements and can take place through different routes such as
collaborative university industry research, contractual research,
patenting and licensing arrangements. In mode III UITT, technology
transfer takes place through the creation of USOs, where we define a
USO as a ‘new firm created to exploit commercially some knowledge,
technology or research results developed within a university’ (Pirnay
et al., 2003). Since the mode I UITT does not satisfy our definition of
UTC, only mode II UITT and mode III UITT are seen as contributing
towards UTC. Friedman & Silberman (2003) have given a simple
representation for how a traditional UTC process comprising of mode
II and mode III UITT is typically structured (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Traditional University Technology Commercialization
In this process, TTOs solicit invention reports from faculty inventors,
and once an invention disclosure is made the technology is evaluated.
If the assessment is favorable, attempts are made to identify potential
licensees. As evident, the role of the TTOs in this process has traditionally
been limited to assisting in the administrative processing of faculty
invention disclosures and the protection of the university ownership
rights of such disclosures. The development of the IP is often left to the
inventor or the industrial licensee, and hence the lack of a business

<-----Page 6----->115 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
development stage in this process (Markham, 2002). In managing this
process, TTOs usually adopt the case management style (Allan, 2001).
Each case coming into the TTO is handled in its entirety by one person,
who is associated with the case through the different stages of the UTC
process, and sometimes beyond. This approach finds acceptance in
most of the large TTOs and it has its advantages in terms of the
centralization of the developments in the case and the ease of
coordination with all major players involved with that particular case.
It also has its advantages in managing a particular IP. However, this
style requires that the talents of very skilled staff who should be able to
manage all the processes from the opportunity scouting all the way to
successful commercialization. This can be a fairly big problem for
smaller TTOs with limited resources, especially those affiliated with
smaller universities. Also, the nature of the process leaves little scope
for activities such as opportunity promotion (Allan, 2001), marketing
of the TTO portfolio (Harmon et al., 1997; Markham, 2002; Rosenberg
& Nelson, 1994), solicitation of ideas from the university researchers
(Thursby & Kemp, 2002), all of which find mention in the UTC literature
as the ‘to be addressed UTC issues’. The wide acceptability of this
model notwithstanding, the available research provides little evidence
for whether this particular model and its specific activities (such as
hiring people with only specific skill sets and training the TTO staff in
patenting and licensing activities), increases the efficiency of the UTC
process or enhances the measurable outcome of the TTOs (Allan, 2001).
Benefits of University Technology Commercialization
According to Carlsson & Fridh (2002), the primary purpose of UTC is to
enable the university researchers to disseminate research results for the
public good. The large and growing body of research in the field of technology transfer lists numerous benefits of UTC notable exception being
Campbell, (1997), Poyago-Theotoky et al. (2002) and Sandelin (1994)
who have looked at its deleterious effects of UTC on basic research, both
for the university as well as in terms of its contribution towards the local,
regional and national economic development.
For the universities, there are major benefits in the form of revenues4,
especially in the current economic environment of reduced university
support, generated by moving the technology into marketplace in the
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 7----->116 Role of University Technology
form of direct industry support, royalties, licensing etc. (Allan, 2001;
Friedman & Silberman, 2003, Hsu & Bernstein; 1997)5. Other benefits
are in the form of financial benefits for the faculty and students, diversity
in the research portfolio of the university, more funds to support
research, new challenges/opportunities for the university researchers,
broadening and enrichment of the intellectual life in the university,
potent marketing tool to attract eminent faculty, students and external
research funding, positive effects on the curriculum etc (Campbell,
1997; Rogers et al., 2000; Stephan, 2001). By properly investing into
their UTC process, universities also creates a rich academic experience
for their students, replete with educational and career opportunities
(Friedman & Silberman, 2003; Stephan, 2001). All of these aspects
come together to help create a stimulating, exciting and self directed
environment which feeds and supports creative and innovative research,
a driver for successful technology commercialization.
Martin & Trudeau (1998) and Martin (1998) found that university
R&D in Canada is a strong driver for economic development, leading
to measurable increase in both GDP and employment. Badlwin &
DaPont (1996) found that the university labs are one of the most
frequently used external source for development of technologies in
Canada. The role of the universities in the growth of high tech industry
is well documented (Upstill & Symington, 2002; Wolfe, 2002). A
number of researchers (Fisher 1998, Gibbons, 2000; Roberts & Malone,
1996) point out how Stanford university has played a prominent role in the
growth of the present day Silicon Valley while others (Saxenian, 1996;
Shane & Stuart, 2002) attribute the development of the, ever quoted, Route
128 to the presence of MIT. In these examples, the universities are treated
as the ‘engines of innovation’, the ‘fertile grounds’ for new ideas which
spurred the creations of commercial products, applications and such highly
successful companies such as Google, Lycos, Cirrus Logic etc. The benefits
in terms of economic and community development, through job creation
(Kramer et al., 1997), development of local businesses (Chrisman et al.,
1998), development of local communities (Parker & Zilberman, 1993),
start of new companies (Harmon et al., 1997; Di Gregorio & Shane, 2003;
Vohora et al., 2003) etc are all well researched and well accepted6.

State of University Technology Commercialization (UTC) in North
America: A Brief Literature Review
Traditionally, the universities have looked at UTC as essentially a licensing
activity and the standard practice of TTOs in North America has been to
define their mandate in terms of licensing university technology to existing
companies (Siegel et al., 2003a, Siegel et al., 2003b; Thursby & Kemp,
2002; Trune, 1996). The recognition being given to USOs as vehicles of
UTC is a more recent phenomenon (Di Gregorio & Shane, 2003). Besides
the benefits of the UTC, other aspects of UTC such as the role and structure
of TTOs, effect of university policies, measures of success and determinants
of success have been widely researched and discussed in the academic
literature (Table 1)

<-----Page 9----->118 Role of University Technology
The literature strongly suggests that the academics have prominent
disagreements with how the UTC is handled in the traditional model of the
TTOs. A number of researchers have discussed the importance of financial
resources or assistance in securing access to sources of funding (Goldhor
& Lund, 1983; Samsom & Gurdon, 1993; Shane & Stuart, 2002; Souder et
al., 1990). The literature however suggests that the universities very rarely
provide funds to the researchers to develop and commercialize their
technology (Etzkowitz, 1998; Lee, 1996; Matkin, 1990). Prior research in
this area also highlights a gap in terms of services provided by the TTOs
and points towards the need for the universities to provide business
development and human resource assistance to their researchers for
successful technology commercialization (Markham, 2002). The literature
suggests that with their focus primarily on licensing arrangements, TTOs
do not necessarily see this as a part of their defined mandate (Graff et al.,
2002). Thursby et al. (2001) in their survey of 62 TTO directors from major
US universities reported that there is a lot of heterogeneity in the objectives
of individual TTOs. This is a very interesting insight, especially since most
of the academics and researchers tend to look at the UTC as a fairly
homogeneous process. This leads us to believe that there would be enormous
benefits in researching why the individual TTOs structure their operations
in a particular way, especially since there is a fair bit of agreement on the
broader objectives (and hence the mandates) of the TTOs. Some important
questions with regard to the two common UTC modes are also unanswered.
While the literature does capture the factors that are conducive to successful
UTC, such as the development of receptor capacity, government support,
the presence or absence of a commercialization champion, presence or
lack of funds and risk management, there is very little insight into what
motivates a researcher to choose between either of the two modes. Further
there is no conclusive evidence on how the TTOs, with their processes in
place to support mode II technology transfer, i.e. licensing arrangements,
encourage and support the creation of USOs. Chapple et al. (2004) disagree
with the traditional TTO model and mention how the UTC may be best
served by smaller offices, more specialized and in a position to learn from
their experiences. They say that the background of the TTO staff may
actually influence the performance of the UTC and insist that there is a
need for populating TTOs with individuals from varied backgrounds rather
than have the university administrators run the whole show. There is also
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 10----->119 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
very little evidence of the mechanisms the TTOs, in their pursuit of finding
the ‘ground breaking money making’ technologies, have in place to choose
the projects with the maximum commercial value.
There are significant differences among the researchers on the
performance measures used to evaluate the success of TTOs. The UTC
effectiveness studies (Carlsson & Fridh, 2002; Foltz et al., 2000; Roger
et al., 2000; Siegel et al., 2003b; Thursby & Kemp, 2002; Thursby et
al., 2001) have tended to focus on the parameters such as the number
of invention disclosures received, the number of patent applications
filed, the number of licenses executed, the gross license income etc.
Performance of the TTO is in general equated to the monetary value of
university owned IP (Muir, 1993). However, Lowe & Quick (2004)
suggest that a TTO should not be managed simply to maximize income,
but the goals of the TTO should be broader and in agreement with the
mission of the university. Accordingly, the creation of wealth, new
jobs and new solutions to the problems in the society should be the
underlying objective of every TTO. Carlsson & Fridh (2002) also insist
that the success of TTOs can’t be captured by merely looking at the
income generated by such undertakings for the university, but their
implications have to be understood in a broader context with due regard
given to their influence on the economic development of the
surrounding communities as well. In his article, Blumenstyk (2004:
A27) quotes the head of the TTO from University of Washington,
Seattle, as “The traditional approach, by focusing on the exclusive
agreements, results in fewer research relationships between academics
and industry and lengthens the time it takes to get the technology
deployed. It also creates political liabilities, fuelling the impression
that universities are more concerned with making money from their
inventions than seeing them used, and false expectations that licensing
revenues can be a significant source of revenue for a university budget.”
Significant differences also exist on the determinants of successful
UTC. Di Gregorio & Shane (2003) reported that they did not find any
conclusive support to justify the argument that industry funding of
university research has a significant effect on the success of UTC. They
also suggest that they found no evidence to the fact that USO activity
is influenced by capital market constraint or the availability of local
venture capital (VC) funding. Infact, they argue that VCs are at best late
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 11----->120 Role of University Technology
stage investors in university technology and it is the angel investors,
government agencies and the universities themselves who have a more
important role to play in the early stages of UTC and hence universities
may be the primary catalysts for the USO development and the resulting
economic development. In this study they also found that university
affiliated incubators and university venture capital funds are
insignificant as far as their influence on the UTC process is concerned.
In their analyses of the success of Stanford University in technology
commercialization, Fisher (1998), points out that success in UTC is
not solely dependent upon the availability of funds or the university
policies and strategies, but also on the university’s surrounding
community’s entrepreneurial climate and its own inherent fertility.
Focus and Organization of the Case Study
The documented differences in the history, organization and performance
of the TTOs as well as our intent to present a non traditional technology
transfer program were a major motivation for this case study. The issues
raised by the UTC literature about the traditional role of the TTOs and the
UTC mechanism in place, leaves us wondering about our understanding of
the UTC process. Certain very important questions remain unanswered.
What exactly is the role of the TTOs, especially in terms of their fit with the
role and mission of the universities? Why has the standardization of the
UTC process not produced similar results across the whole spectrum of
TTOs? What are the values and norms that should dictate the operations of
a TTO? Are their certain practices that the TTOs need to develop to tackle
the issues identified in the UTC literature? How can the TTOs disadvantaged
by a lack of resources best rise up the challenges of successful UTC? If all
of the disclosures do not hold the same promise, then how should the TTOs
allocate development efforts especially if the bottom-line is the maximization
of profits? How should TTOs make their staffing decision? Even as the rest
of the world has accepted the advantages of diversity and multidisciplinary
teams, why are TTOs still working with an old age model of hiring very
skilled staff specialized in certain operations? Are there any benefits, above
and beyond the documented benefits, to the UTC process? Can there be a
model for an ideal TTO, which can then be easily replicated? What do the
TTOs need to do to address the needs of a knowledge economy; for example,
are there any benefits for TTOs to start investigating international
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 12----->121 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
opportunities? Is the success of a TTO influenced by the presence of a
champion? These are the questions that need to be answered for us to
develop a better understanding of the UTC and how can best manage it.
The authors also believe that it is time for us to understand the role of the
TTOs in the broader context of UTC. Are TTOs simply service providers,
providing cutting edge service to the university researchers? Is their role
only limited to dealing with the movement of technology from a university
setting to an industry setting, or should the TTOs play a more prominent
role in moulding themselves as innovation agents to help stimulate a culture
of innovation on the university campuses. It is our firm belief that the
TTOs will continue to play an important role in UTC. But, at the same time
its is important for the TTOs to recognize and accept the fact that they
could impact the UTC in more profound manner if apart from the services
that they provide in their traditional roles, they were to see their role in
nurturing an innovation centric entrepreneurial culture on the university
campus. The following case study captures the experience of Carleton
University Foundry Program, a non traditional technology transfer program,
in how it is trying to address some of the issues raised here.
CASE STUDY: CARLETON UNIVERSITY FOUNDRY PROGRAM
The Carleton university Foundry program (the ‘Foundry’ henceforth) was
launched in 2002 to assist Carleton University (‘Carleton’ henceforth),
located in Canada’s capital, Ottawa, in its technology transfer agenda. The
Foundry was conceptualized as a program that will help the serve the
commercialization aspirations of the Carleton researchers from areas as
diverse as sensor technology to photonics to biomedical and health. The
program is managed by the Technology and Research Development Office
(TRDO), under the stewardship of a director who reports directly to the VP
of Research. While the TRDO takes care of all of the UITT aspects, such
as IP management and industry liaison, the Foundry was created specifically
as a University technology commercialization program to take care of
UTC on the Carleton campus.

About the Carleton University Foundry Program
The need for a Foundry-type program was first conceived in 1998. The
original focus of the ‘early’ Foundry was primarily on the funding of proofof-concept and prototype development projects deemed to have potential
commercial applications. At the time, it appeared that funding was the
most pressing issue facing researchers motivated in moving their ideas
from lab to market. Other critical factors such as providing business
development strategies and other value-added services were not considered
as part of the original program, which was modelled on traditional
technology transfer programs. The original name of the program, the
‘Carleton Technology Advancement Fund’ indeed reflected its narrow
scope. Soon following the original program’s implementation, it became
apparent that the needs of researchers interested in commercialising their
discoveries would be better addressed through a more comprehensive
program. Important new program components were thus added such as the
development of sound business cases for qualified projects and linkages
with professionals outside of the university community. An unintended but
welcomed effect was also observed at this time. The program seemed to
generate much interest and enthusiasm on the part of university researchers
to act on their ideas. In essence, the program was helping to stimulate a
significant culture change on campus. The program changed its name
accordingly reflecting the symbolism of the ‘Foundry Processes’ where
new value-added components are created from raw materials. In the case
of the re-named Foundry, the raw materials were in fact the ideas and
discoveries made by university researchers.
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 14----->123 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
The Foundry is a lean, low cost innovation development and
commercialisation program based on a philosophy focused on the
importance of building and nurturing an innovation culture (i.e. a culture
which supports innovation by encouraging the researchers to act on
their ideas) on the Carleton campus while providing the optimal level
of value added services to those accepted into the program. The
motivation behind the Foundry was to put in place a 21st century model
technology transfer program, one that would aggressively redefine the
mandate of a TTO to include ‘nurturing of innovation’ as a core
mandate, exhibit and encourage entrepreneurial behaviour, nurture a
culture that would reward risk taking, partner with like-minded
institutions/organizations/agencies locally, regionally and globally and
champion these directions in its day to day working and its internal
values and norms. Specifically the program defines its mandate as:
1. It is the primary source of assistance for Carleton university researchers
(including faculty, students and staff) for innovation development and
commercialization of their technology.
2. It serves as an institutional enabler by helping create and sustain a
culture which engages the creative and innovative spirits of the
university researchers.
3. It supports mechanism to facilitate partnerships and linkages which
stimulate economic development.
4. It puts in place mechanism to attract young people to
commercialization and serve as a virtual incubator for the next
generation of entrepreneurs, business leaders and UTC managers.
Though most TTOs define a general mission statement for their operations,
The Foundry goes beyond a simple mission statement and has adopted a
working philosophy supported by core values. The Foundry’s mission is
‘to cultivate and sustain an innovation culture on campus through the
provision of meaningful support to Carleton researchers motivated to move
their discoveries in a commercial direction’. The core values of the Foundry
underpin the delivery of the Program, that is, respect for its clientele,
always giving a benefit of doubt to researchers, no unbending prejudgements of a technology’s potential and a constant endeavour to create
a positive experience all those engaged with the program. It is clear that
this mission statement and core values of the Program distinguish the
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 15----->124 Role of University Technology
Foundry from those defined by most other TTOs. In particular, the Foundry
eschews the recent inclination of TTOs in primarily selecting ‘investment
grade’ IP with the greatest potential for financial return to the university.
Current UTC practices spend an inordinate amount of time assessing such
opportunities with a VC-like objective of picking potential ‘winners’. In
the end, the TTOs often limit their support to a few projects that might
represent the biggest possible financial return to the university. The risk in
adopting this UTC approach is the potential of discouraging the formation
of successful small and medium-size enterprises that create the bulk of
jobs in communities. The Foundry, instead, seeks to adopt an approach
that is more logically aligned with both the academic goals of the university
(i.e., education/teaching, research and innovation, community service, etc.)
and the technology driven regional economic development (i.e., job creation
and wealth generation).
The approach of the program is to work with people motivated to take
their ideas forward and support them in achieving their goals. The program
has developed a model, referred to as the ‘IPO model’ (Table 3), to establish
a right fit between the incoming projects and the Foundry goals. In order to
differentiate projects more appropriately suited for traditional research
funding (and hence eligible for support from other sources such as public
research agencies), the projects are pre-screened and applicants who meet
the IPO standards are then invited to formally apply to the Foundry.

The IPO model serves as a useful method to ‘qualify’ projects that can
clearly benefit from Foundry support. The model is implemented in such
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 16----->125 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
a way that prospective applicants know precisely how their projects are
evaluated thereby providing a transparency in the process typically not
found in other university-based prototype development programs. Using
the IPO model, projects are scrutinized at each stage of the Foundry process (Figure 3) at increasing levels of analysis and the results communicated to the applicants. A proposal that successfully passes these stages
results in a solid and well-written business case. Applicants whose proposals fail to meet the IPO tests nonetheless receive valuable feedback from
the Program and are encouraged either to re-apply in the future or directed
to other programs that are better suited for their needs. For those applicants who still feel that there is value in continuing assistance from the
Foundry, possibilities exist for assistance with commercialization issues
such as market and opportunity analysis and competitor analysis, through
the student internship component of the program. In the past, proposals
that pass the IPO test, as they move through the different stages of the
Foundry process, are given final approval in 90% of the cases.

Figure 3: The Foundry Process
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 17----->126 Role of University Technology
The Foundry process is a simple straight forward stage gate process in
which the IPO model is used to determine whether a project moves from
one stage to or is phased out. Typically, on an average, it can take a project
anywhere between four to ten weeks to move through the entire process,
which draws on all three components of the program. Like most other
TTOs the projects coming into the Foundry can take any one of the following three routes:
1. Potential for a spin off company.
2. Technology that may fit external company’s needs and can be
transferred via a licensing arrangement.
3. Potential for new research partnerships with private or public sector.
The commercialization process in place is not very different from that
followed by the traditional TTOs, the difference being in how the process
is managed. The use of the IPO model basically creates exit gates in
the process, which allow for a project to be screened out at any of
these gates for specific reasons. For example, in the course of preparing
a business case for a project it may be discovered that important
assumptions about the commercialization of a technology were ignored
or simply never considered by the applicants. Weaknesses that are
determined to be sufficiently critical are discussed with the applicants
following the submission of a proposal to the Foundry and a decision
is made whether the proposal moves on to the next stages in the process.
A number of projects that initially ‘qualify’ for the Foundry are
sometimes screened out upon more diligent analysis of market, technical
and commercialization issues. The philosophy of the Foundry towards
creating positive outcomes plays an important role in cases where
projects are screened out. For example, projects that do not qualify for
later stages in the Foundry are actively directed to other appropriate
programs or resources that can provide ongoing support to the
researchers or in some cases may even qualify for continuing support
to re-enter the program at a later stage. In every case, the goal is to
provide all applicants (including those unsuccessful ones) with a positive
experience in the Foundry.
Components of Foundry
From a delivery standpoint, the program comprises of three main
components; a grant-based innovation award, a student internship
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 18----->127 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
component and a volunteer community. By properly leveraging these three
components, the Foundry has been very successful in generating interest
in UTC on the Carleton campus as well as in the local community.

Figure 4: The Three Components of the Foundry Program
1) Grant based innovation awards: Grant based innovation awards,
of up to CDN $15K, are appropriate at this stage of innovation
development resulting from academic research. Though the level
of funding seems inconsequential, the reality is that such funding
can be particularly useful for concept level projects of relatively
short duration (under twelve months). In other words, the funding
serves not only as a catalyst but fuels critical momentum at the
earliest stages of innovation development without the unnecessary
burden of requiring strings be attached such as equity and licensing
terms.
2) Student Internship: The Foundry espouses the importance of
training students in the field of technology commercialization. This
is consistent with the university academic goals of teaching/training
and the development of future talent. At the same time, the program
recognizes that the university students are a very valuable resource
for the program itself. Student interns are drawn from science,
engineering and business programs to create multidisciplinary teams
that work on selected projects and provide very useful services
(such as technology validation, market and competitive analysis
and patent search). The program also recognizes the advantage of having
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 19----->128 Role of University Technology
international students in these intern teams, since the global economy
more than often dictates that some of the pertinent issues (such as
market segments, strategies for entry into global markets, cultural issues
and international trade laws) may be of an international nature.
3) Volunteer Community: Local economies are often blessed with a deep
and experienced pool of talent familiar with the challenges of
commercializing new technology. The Foundry believes that this
is a resource which should be leveraged in a productive and
intelligent way. A growing base of sixty external volunteers from
the local community is now actively involved with the Foundry.
These volunteers not only review and comment on the proposals
submitted to the program, they also offer unparalleled access to
the networks of local professionals and advisors. In addition, this
arrangement keeps the local business community informed about
the commercialization activity taking place on the Carleton
university campus.
The main components of the Foundry listed above represent a streamlined
‘low-overhead’ approach to supporting innovation on campus. The
essential theme inherent in this approach is efficiently leveraging scarce
and talented resources for the benefit of all Foundry participants. The
efficient use and leveraging of limited capital (financial and human) is
an underlying factor in successful innovation and equally applies to how
the Foundry itself is implemented. Furthermore, the Foundry is delivered
in such a manner to enhance the university experience of students hired
as interns. As the Foundry is very much an internal program within an
academic institution, it must reflect the values and mission of the parent
organization. The objectives of the Foundry are also not very different
from the traditional TTO objectives, except for the fact that besides UTC,
Foundry also has a defined agenda to encourage and support innovation,
and has put in mechanisms like the grant-based award and the internship
component for the pursuit of the same.
Present Status and Future Plans
Over the last two years, the program has made some significant progress
(Table 4) in the pursuit of an agenda that is in stark contrast to the
agendas pursued by similar technology transfer programs.

Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 20----->129 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
Table 4: Achievements of the Foundry
1) 15 projects supported by the Foundry representing a
CDN $ 200,000 investment
2) 13 start-ups (including 10 USOs) supported or directly
started by the Foundry
3) Close to $4 million leveraged from other sources in
support of projects
4) Direct jobs created: 30
5) Over 30 high qualified student interns
6) At least 60 (and growing) external volunteers

In its present form, the program is markedly different from the traditional
commercialization and prototype development offered by TTOs (Table
5). A defining feature of the Foundry is its high degree of inclusiveness.
As highlighted before, the program enlists the support of bright students
(interns) responsible for assisting researchers prepare proposals,
volunteers drawn from the external community who can provide
feedback to researchers and finally, the eligibility of applicants being
any individual (faculty, staff, student, adjunct research professor and
visiting scientist) on the Carleton campus engaged in some form of
innovation and R&D activity. Another important defining characteristic
of the Foundry is the inherent flexibility of the program in terms of
types of projects supported, use of funds and post-funding support.

Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 21----->130 Role of University Technology
Much of the current and expected future focus of the Foundry is the
enrichment of the student experience as interns. Internships in the Foundry
are primarily designed to train and give students experience in the
management of innovation as opposed to training licensing and technology
transfer specialists. The reality is that most graduates of the Foundry
will most likely enter careers where they will either manage or take part
(in some capacity) in the development of new and innovative products
and services. A limited number of new interns in the future may be
oriented towards developing more specialized skills associated with the
practice of technology transfer.
Another critical component of the Foundry’s success is the
intelligent leveraging of local community assets. The Foundry will
continuously seek those individuals and organizations that share the
same goals of stimulating regional economic development and
innovation support. For example, with the technology downturn of
the past few years, many highly qualified, but unemployed technology
workers, are seeking new career opportunities. The Foundry is
working closely with several employee support groups to develop
innovative ways of leveraging this talent to support the UTC activities
in general and the Foundry in particular. There are also untapped
opportunities associated with helping universities in less developed
countries to implement programs that will stimulate economic and
social development by nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship.
Internationalization of the Foundry may also help to establish external
market beachheads for USOs supported by the Foundry. The Foundry
firmly believes that the low associated cost and the simple structure
of the program will make it very attractive to universities in these
countries as well as for smaller universities and research institutions
in North America. Also, sharing the best practises with all those
involved in the UTC agenda if a fundamental philosophy of the
program. This, however, is not to say that the established TTO
operations cannot benefit from a Foundry like model. For example,
the opportunities inherent of the internship component and the external
volunteer community are limitless and can be replicated easily by
any TTO to get immediate access to a highly qualified and motivated
mass of technology transfer professionals.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Our focus in this study was restricted to an analysis of how the Carleton
University Foundry program manages the UTC process on the Carleton
university campus. The small size of the program, as well as its recent
origin, precludes us from drawing any quantitative conclusions or from
claiming generality for the insights we draw from this analysis. The
intention of this study is not to present a quantitative analysis of the
success or failure of the Carleton university UTC process, but rather to
discuss how a young innovative UTC program, with a fresh outlook
and a unique approach is redefining the TTOs approach towards UTC.
The authors recognize, and accept, that the Foundry program may only
handle a small portion of the research coming out of Carleton University,
but it is our firm belief that our selection of the Foundry program is a
suitable first cut into the study of how a fresh approach towards UTC
can generate a UTC practice, which can itself be innovative and effective
while remaining relevant to a university’s core mission.
In understanding the true impact of UTC, we have to understand
(and accept) that universities are no longer walled compounds on the
top of hills but are institutions that thrive on a free flow of ideas among
the academics, the government and the business community. Innovation
sustained by this free flow of ideas has always been (and will continue
to be) the driver for commercializable ideas coming out of the university.
It also has to be remembered that they usually form an integral and
vital part of the communities in which they are located. It should be a
logical choice for us to make the enormous pool of scientific and
engineering talent, discovery and application existing in the universities
to the business community. This, however, cannot be achieved if the
universities, and the TTOs in particular, keep on devising their agendas
along the historical lines of treating themselves as licensing agents.
The analysis of the UTC literature firmly establishes the fact that UTC
needs to be understood in its broader context. It cannot be simply
dictated by a pursuit of maximization of the university profits, instead
the universities (through their TTOs) need to come up with innovative
solutions. In keeping with the broader objective of the UTC, success
would have to be a measure of parameters such as the influence on the
local and regional economy, transfer of best practices regionally,
nationally as well as internationally, the number of jobs created,
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 23----->132 Role of University Technology
development and sustenance of an entrepreneurial culture and the
involvement of the local business community. In order to achieve this,
efforts will be needed in creating a receptive business community,
generating linkages with other agencies and not for profit organizations
and putting in place a university culture that supports and rewards
commercialization. This, however, will have to be done in such a way
that a proper balance between the basic objectives of the university,
i.e. excellence in teaching and research, and the broader objective of
dissemination of university research for the good of the wider
community is maintained.
While the role of the government policy like the Bayh-Dole act
cannot be discounted, the authors believe that it is the individual TTOs
that have to come up with innovative solutions and take a leading role
in helping support the knowledge-economy dictated needs of their
researchers and institutions. This essentially means that the traditional
mandate of the TTOs which primarily revolved around the early
identification and encouragement of the ‘best’ ideas to help create
‘winners’ has to be re-evaluated. Efforts aimed at the development,
recognition and rewarding of entrepreneurial skills need to be built
into the processes that support UTC. Through the case study of the
Foundry Program, we have attempted to answer some of the questions
raised earlier, such as, how should the role of the TTOs be established,
what kind of norms and values should dictate the operations of a TTO,
how can the TTOs leverage resources on the university campus as well
as in the local community to create a low cost effective operation, how
can the TTOs (using something on lines of the IPO model) transparently
allocate development efforts to the incoming disclosures and what
should be some of the performance metrics used to evaluate our UTC
efforts. It is the authors opinion that while archival patenting and
licensing data is a wonderful source to conduct objective quantitative
analysis, it precludes us from gaining a complete understanding of
UTC. Basic research into the mechanisms and characteristics of
individual TTOs would definitely give us a better insight into some of
the unexplored aspects of UTC (as well as some of our unanswered
questions). Further work on models such as the one adopted by the
Foundry program would definitely be an interesting contribution to
this field. The Foundry experience has beyond any doubt validated
Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 24----->133 Sharma, Kumar, Lalande
that special attention should be given to developing innovative UTC
components on the lines of the volunteer community and the student
internship to gain access to a readily available wealth of experience
and to help prepare the next generation of managers, highly educated
and motivated young entrepreneurs and business leaders familiar with
the challenges of innovation.
In conclusion, the authors firmly believe that TTOs should practice
what they preach about making innovation happen. However, in saying
that, it is not our intent to imply that the Carleton University Foundry
program is the only program looking differently at the UTC. The need
of the hour, however, is for all such UTC programs/TTO operations to
come together and help foster a new TTO culture that besides
addressing the UTC needs of the universities also treats nurturing of
innovation and entrepreneurship as its core value. It is the authors firm
belief that only through an arrangement like this can we truly deliver
on the full potential of UTC.

UTC is University Technology Commercialisation.
TTO is a Technology Transfer Organisation.

1. According to AUTM (1999) data, the number of patents issued to US
universities and colleges doubled between 1979 and 1984 (from 177 to
408, doubled again between 1984 and 1989 (to 1008) and then doubled
again in the first half of 1990 (Allan, 2001; Hsu & Bernstein, 1997;
Mowery et al., 1998).
2. According to AUTM (1999) data, the number of TTOs in US
universities increased from around 20 in 1980 to almost 220 in the
1990 and presently every major research university in US has a
TTO.
3. Di Gregorio & Shane (2003) point out that USOs are fast becoming
an important medium for research commercialization. They account
for roughly 12% of the transfer of the university assigned inventions
to the industry, and are highly successful in it, with roughly 70% of
them surviving beyond a year of their creation.

Journal of Services Research, Volume 6, Special Issue (July, 2006)

<-----Page 25----->134 Role of University Technology
4. The idea that UTC can create significant revenue for the universities is
driven by the success stories of ‘big winner’ technologies such as the
USD $160 million earnings of Michigan State University from two
cancer related patents, University of Florida’s USD $37 million earnings
from the energy drink Gatorade, Iowa State University’s USD $27
million earnings from its fa algorithm and Stanford University’s USD
$143 million earnings from its recombinant DNA gene splicing patent
(Rogers et al., 2000).
5. Allan (2001), using the AUTM data from 1999 points out that
Columbia University generated US $ 89.1 million through its UTC
activities in the year 1999. However, there is not much empirical
data to suggest that similar success has been achieved in most other
universities.
6. Working with the TTO data from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT), Shane & Stuart (2002) found that roughly 20%
of USOs coming out of MIT experience an initial public offering
hence leading to significant wealth creating for the university
researchers. In 1999, commercialization of academic research in
US resulted in more than $40 billion in economic activity and helped
create (and support) more than 270,000 jobs while business activity
associated with the sales of products arising out of academic
research was estimated to have generated $5.0 billion in tax
revenues for the US government. During the same period, 340
new USOs were created, with 82% of them operating in the same
state as the academic institution (Allan, 2001; reporting on AUTM
1999 data)
