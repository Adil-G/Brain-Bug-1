Abstract
The current study uses theory from the resource-based view of strategy to hypothesize that VCs use non-additive
decision policies when making their investment decision. A policy capturing experiment finds that VCs do indeed use
non-additive decision policies. Specifically, we find that interactions between leadership experience and other internal
resources, and between leadership experience and environmental munificence, affect venture capitalists! decisionmaking. Although venture capitalists always prefer greater general experience in leadership, they value it more highly in
large markets, when there are many competitors, and when the competitors are relatively weak. Previous start-up
experience of the venture!s management team may substitute for leadership experience. Building on these results, we
tested a main-effects-only decision-aid and a decision-aid that included interaction terms (non-additive) and found that
both outperformed VCs! own decisions.

1. Introduction
Venture capital (VC) is an important source of
equity for those new ventures that revitalize the
economy. In a study of all firms that received VC
between 1970 and 2000, it was found that VCbacked firms created one out of every nine jobs and
these firms also accounted for over 11% of the

country!s GDP (NVCA, 2002). It is well worth
asking then, what factors affect VCs! decisions (Sapienza and Korsgaard, 1996). VCs choose to invest
in those firms that they believe have the potential to
generate high returns. Resource-based view (RBV)
suggests that new ventures possess specific resource
endowments that may lead to superior performance
(Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991). In
short, firm resources can provide the basis for
competitive advantage that enables firms to earn
rents. As such, VCs can evaluate a venture!s potential by examining its resource assets.
Fundamental to the resource-based perspective
is the belief that those resources and capabilities

that are valuable, rare, costly to imitate, and nonsubstitutable become core competencies and serve
as a source of the firm!s competitive advantage over
its rivals (Barney, 1991). Resources and capabilities
lead to a competitive advantage, however, only
when a strategy is chosen and implemented that
allows the firm to best exploit its core competencies
in the external environment (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993). Therefore, the strategic leadership of
the top management team (the ability to anticipate,
envision, maintain flexibility, and empower others
to create strategic change) is important to achieving above average returns (Ireland and Hitt, 1999).
For example, the team may be able to leverage
proprietary technology to establish a longer leadtime over potential entrants thereby earning higher
rents (Shepherd and Shanley, 1998). Or, the team
that has greater market experience should be able
to best position the company to take advantage of
the opportunity. The basic premise is that entrepreneurship is as much about opportunity recognition as exploiting the opportunity. Thus, we ask
whether strategic leadership is equally critical to
VCs! investment assessments in all situations and if
not, whether a decision-aid that includes nonadditive relationships can help improve a VC firm!s
investment decision.
This paper examines how VCs evaluate entrepreneurs! leadership experience, a firm resource
that can lead to a competitive advantage, in conjunction with other important criteria for predicting new venture success. We then construct a
decision-aid and test its performance. In doing so,
we shed light on the managerial decision of
investing a VC firm!s resources and offer a decisionaid to guide this complex investment process. 2 By
constructing decision-aids the managers of VC
firms have the opportunity ‘‘to enhance the degree
of conformity and coherence between the evolution
of the decision-making process and the value systems and objectives of those involved in the process’’ (Roy, 1990, p. 324) and those values and
objectives most desirable for the firm. This aim is

2

These objectives are consistent with those of OR-DA:
‘‘seeking essentially to give scientific authority to decisions of a
purely managerial nature’’ (Roy, 1993).

achieved when a firm!s decision-aids can help its
VCs make better decisions ‘‘in the presence of
ambiguity, uncertainty, and an abundance of
bifurcations’’ (Roy, 1990, p. 324).
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2
develops hypotheses based upon the RBV of the
firm. Specifically, we propose that VCs place
considerable weight on the entrepreneur!s leadership experience, but place more weight on leadership when it complements other firm resources and
when the market is munificent. Section 3 discusses
the ‘‘policy capturing’’ research method used in
this study, the sample, and the survey instrument.
We develop a refined decision-aid that leads to
improved performance over and above VCs! own
assessments. Section 4 reviews the results in light
of the strategy literature and our understanding of
VCs! decision-making. Concluding comments are
given in Section 5.

2. Conceptual framework
How do people acquire strategic leadership
abilities? While the process is complicated, we do
know that the amount of experience people have
affects the strategic choices they make and the
models they use to make those decisions (Hitt and
Tyler, 1991). The cognitive science literature suggests that experience is a good proxy for expertise
(Choo and Trotman, 1991; Simon, 1985), meaning
that experienced decision makers in a given task
may indeed employ better decision processes than
do less experienced ones (Nosofsky, 1987). Simon
(1985) argues that it takes 10 years to achieve
‘‘50,000 chunks of knowledge,’’ which often add
up to superior decision performance. Furthermore, as individuals become more experienced
with respect to a particular task, they learn to focus attention primarily on the key dimensions
(Choo and Trotman, 1991) and create categories
of information based on a deep structure that involves more, stronger, and richer links between
concepts (Frederick, 1991).
Complementary resources may increase the
value of leadership experience, such that this
bundle of leadership and resources are more
valuable, durable, scarce, and difficult to imitate

<-----Page 2----->A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

than each resource by itself. Bundling the resources creates a ‘‘strategic asset’’ which may lead
to sustainable economic rents assuming it matches
the needs/desires of the market (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993). Amit and Schoemaker (1993) assert
that the creation of strategic assets is a boundedly
rational process. Entrepreneurs bring together resources in unique combinations based upon their
interpretation of the environment. The bundle is
durable to the extent that it is a function of the
firm!s unique resource pool and to the extent that
the market continues to value the bundle. Firm
specificity increases scarcity––it is difficult to
recreate a competitive advantage. We assert that
leadership experience is more beneficial to the firm
in the presence of these resources.
Just as complementary resources increase total
value, resources that are substitutable for each other
decrease total value (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993).
Firms accumulating complementary assets may
develop economies of scope (Dierickx and Cool,
1989). In essence, the cost of adding complementary
resources becomes progressively less on a per resource basis, but if the resources are substitutes, the
firm incurs the full cost of resource acquisition. The
VC decision-making literature suggests that valuable new venture resources include leadership
experience, proprietary technology, market familiarity and previous start-up experience (MacMillan
et al., 1985; Muzyka et al., 1996), but does not
consider whether these resources are complementary or substitutable. Most of the previous VC
decision-making literature views the criteria independently––as main effects (e.g., MacMillan et al.,
1985; Muzyka et al., 1996; Zacharakis and Meyer,
2000). It appears that environmental conditions
also significantly influence the effectiveness of
leadership (Pettigrew, 1987); but again the VC
decision-making literature does not sufficiently
consider whether environmental conditions provide
the context for leadership and may serve as a
moderator of the effects of experience on decisions.
2.1. Proprietary technology and leadership experience
The resource-based model proposes that proprietary technology can lead to a competitive

675

advantage when it helps a company neutralize
threats and/or exploit opportunities (is valuable);
is not possessed by others (is rare); is difficult and
costly to imitate; and has no strategic equivalents
(is non-substitutable) (Mata et al., 1995). But
ownership of proprietary technology is not sufficient. It is often difficult to protect a product!s
proprietary nature as competitors can hire away
key individuals, reverse engineer the technology
and so forth. Leaders must enable their organizations to exploit the technology in the market
(Ireland and Hitt, 1999; Mata et al., 1995). The
opportunity to exploit proprietary technology increases the firm!s options, or strategic degrees of
freedom. It is when strategic degrees of freedom
are high that choosing the ‘‘best’’ course of action
has the greatest impact on new venture success
(Porter, 1980; Quinn, 1980). Thus, strong leadership and proprietary technology are complementary resources:
Hypothesis 1. VCs value general leadership experience more when the technology is more proprietary.
2.2. Market familiarity and leadership experience
Intangible resources such as knowledge are
considered valuable and a potential source of
competitive advantage. In particular, knowledge
generated from market familiarity provides a good
indication of the entrepreneur!s ability to cope
with changing market circumstances (Roure and
Madique, 1986). The more deeply entrepreneurs
understand the market, the better they are at
anticipating converging trends and opportunities,
as well as competitor moves and threats. Combining market familiarity with leadership experience enables the new venture to develop and
execute an effective strategy. Leadership experience and market familiarity are complementary;
together they increase the value of the resource
bundle by making it more rare and more difficult
to imitate (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993).
Hypothesis 2. VCs value general leadership experience more when the team!s market familiarity is
high.

2.3. Start-up experience and leadership experience
VCs also value previous experience with startups (MacMillan et al., 1985). Serial entrepreneurs
better understand how to organize start-ups
(Wright et al., 1997). By their nature, new organizations experience conflict and confusion in
recognizing the tasks that need to be performed
and allocating people to those tasks. Entrepreneurs with start-up experience understand these
issues and have likely developed strategies to resolve them. Stuart and Abetti (1990) found that
managerial experience in previous ventures had the
most significant positive influence on subsequent
start-ups. Wright et al. (1997) found that 75% of
55 UK VCs preferred to invest in serial entrepreneurs because of their wider management experience, demonstrated motivation, and proven track
record.
However, other research calls into question the
value of past start-up experience. Birley and
Westhead (1994) investigated 408 new businesses
and found no evidence to suggest that new businesses established by ‘‘habitual’’ founders with
prior experience in business venturing are particularly advantaged compared to inexperienced
entrepreneurs. In addition, Wright et al. (1997)
find that VCs did not report serial entrepreneurs as
performing any better than first time entrepreneurs
did. Why this apparent discrepancy between
studies? There are a number of possible explanations. First, ‘‘experienced entrepreneurs. . . may
attempt to repeat actions that were successful in an
earlier venture in new circumstances that are quite
different (Westhead and Wright, 1998). Second, an
entrepreneur!s motivation to succeed may lessen,
particularly if their previous venture was successful
(Starr and Bygrave, 1992). Third, serial entrepreneurs may not recognize their own limitations
(Wright et al., 1997). Thus, as a main effect, startup experience is ambiguous. However, general
leadership experience may enhance the power of
previous start-up experience making it scarcer,
more durable, and more difficult to imitate than
either factor separately. Thus, we argue that startup experience complements general leadership
experience.

Hypothesis 3. VCs value leadership experience
more when the team also has previous start-up
experience.
2.4. Environmental conditions and leadership experience
Some environments are complementary to
leadership experience, while others act as substitutes. An environment that can support sustained
growth by a particular organization is described as
‘‘munificent’’ (Castrogiovanni, 1991; Goll and
Rasheed, 1997). Castrogiovanni (1991) distinguishes among three kinds of munificence: (1)
capacity, or market size (Child, 1972), (2) rate of
market growth (Dess and Beard, 1984), and (3)
opportunity, or resource availability in excess of
industry usage (Castrogiovanni, 1991). Highly
competitive environments indicate low levels of
resource availability beyond industry usage and
therefore low munificence (Castrogiovanni, 1991).
For example, population ecologists argue that
populations have a carrying capacity that is fully
utilized where there are not enough resources to
support the entry of new competitors and still
support those already in the industry (e.g., Brittain
and Freeman, 1980; Lambkin and Day, 1989). The
VC decision-making literature is consistent with
the munificence construct in that VCs view market size, growth, and competition as key attributes to consider in making their investment
decision (MacMillan et al., 1985; Muzyka et al.,
1996).
Hrebiniak and Joyce (1985) assert that the
external resource dependence and other environmental influences, together with leadership!s role
in competitive positioning and organizational design, jointly affect organizational performance. In
a situation where munificence (benign environment with low external threats [Hrebiniak and
Joyce, 1985]) is low and, consequently, competitive
forces are high, the firm is highly dependent upon
the environment, and therefore a leader!s strategic
choices are severely limited (Hrebiniak and Joyce,
1985; Lawless and Finch, 1989). However, where
munificence is high and competitive forces are low,
there are multiple means of achieving desired
outcomes (Hrebiniak and Joyce, 1985), and

<-----Page 4----->A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

therefore a strong leader has more opportunity to
influence a company!s ultimate success (Goll and
Rasheed, 1997).
We would therefore expect that VCs would
place greater importance on leadership experience
in environments that are more munificent. We
propose that the environment is more munificent
when the target market is large and its projected
growth rate is high. Large markets likely have
longer operating history. Hence, the problems
ventures are likely to face are understood and
easier to identify. In such a market, strong entrepreneurial leaders can use this information to
make decisions that lead to superior performance.
Less accomplished leaders may not interpret the
industry as effectively. Growing markets, on the
other hand, are forgiving. One or two bad decisions can be learning points. Thus, effective leaders
can have a greater impact in munificent environments. If a new venture can capture 5% of a large
market, it can derive significant sales often without
incurring the ire of other market participants. And
if the market is growing, new entrants typically go
after new customers rather than those of their
competitors. In a small market, venture growth is
constrained not only by market size but also by
competitor awareness. Thus, a leader!s decision
effectiveness is similarly constrained. 3 Thus,
Hypothesis 4. VCs value general leadership experience more for markets that are (a) larger, and (b)
faster growing.
Hypothesis 5. VCs value leadership experience
more when competitors are (a) fewer and (b) relatively weaker.
2.5. A non-additive decision-aid for venture capitalists
VCs often rely on ‘‘gut feel’’ when making the
investment decision (Khan, 1987), which may
make the decision prone to biases (Shepherd et al.,

3

A possible alternate explanation is that the room for error
is less in slower growing markets and therefore leadership
experience would be more valued.

677

2003; Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000). Biases and
heuristics inhibit optimal decisions (e.g., Hogarth
and Makridakis, 1981). The availability bias, for
example, may encourage decision makers to recall
past successes rather than failures (Dawes et al.,
1989). Therefore, a VC is apt to assess the success
of a current venture prospect by how similar the
current prospect is to a past success. If the venture
under consideration uses the same technology, or
has the same lead entrepreneur, such available
information may bias the VC to overlook other
information that suggests the current venture is
likely to fail. Likewise, a VC utilizing a satisfying
heuristic might reject new venture proposals when
the minimum requirement for any one criterion is
not met, even if all other remaining factors are
substantially higher than the minimum requirements. As such, the VC may eliminate potentially
profitable investments from further consideration
because of a heuristic rule (s)he is using to keep the
task manageable.
A decision-aid that decomposes the decision
into its component parts helps the VC focus on a
series of smaller decisions, thereby minimizing the
gestalt process of the ‘‘gut decision.’’ Zacharakis
and Meyer (2000) found that a main effects decision-aid outperformed VCs in making the screening decision. The current paper extends previous
work into VC decision-aids by asking whether a
non-additive decision-aid might further improve a
VC!s decision. Some decision-making scholars
have argued that main-effect models capture the
majority of the variance (e.g., Louviere, 1988;
Slovic and Lichtenstein, 1971). However, since
VCs focus on identifying high potential ventures
(those ventures that can generate returns in excess
of 50%) we argue that even a marginal improvement in explained variance may have a dramatic
improvement on the VC!s success in ‘‘picking
winners’’ and therefore the VC firm!s return on
investment. We now explore the use of models as
decision-aids and then compare the performance
of these decision-aids to the performance of the
VCs from which it was created.
A common type of decision-aid uses expert input to define important criteria; such models are
called bootstrap models (Dawes and Corrigan,
1974; Fischhoff, 1988; Slovic, 1972). Bootstrap

<-----Page 5----->678

A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

models aim to capture the expert!s cognitive system, including both the criteria and relative
weights actually used by VCs in past decisions.
Equal weighting models are a simplified version of
bootstrap models and aim to capture the criteria
used by VCs but assume that each criterion is of
equal importance to the judgment being made. A
number of studies across a variety of decision
contexts have found that each of these statistical
models outperforms actual decision-makers (Camerer, 1981; Dawes, 1971; Osherson et al., 1997;
Lyness and Cornelius, 1982; Libby and Libby,
1989). For example, Einhorn (1974) found that a
bootstrap model outperformed expert pathologists
in predicting a patient!s survival from cancer based
on nine histological cues.
We propose that bootstrap models have the
potential to increase a VC firm!s return on
investment by improving a VC!s decision accuracy.
Bootstrap models do this because they are consistent, they are not biased by a non-random
sample, they optimally weight information factors,
and they reduce the decision-maker!s cognitive
load (Camerer, 1981). Zacharakis and Meyer
(2000) developed an equal weighted model as a
decision-aid for evaluating VC proposals. Their
model outperformed VCs in differentiating between those proposals that would generate returns
and those that would fail. We argue that if VCs use
the non-additive relationships proposed above,
then the performance of a decision-aid can be
improved by constructing a decision-aid that
incorporates these non-additive relationships.
Thus,
Hypothesis 6. (a) The main-effects-only decisionaid will outperform VCs! own assessments. (b) The
non-additive decision-aid will outperform VCs!
own assessments.

judgments based on a set of attributes from
which the underlying structure of their decisions can be decomposed by means of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). This method allows
the researcher to examine how the respondent
processes non-additive relationships (Hitt and
Barr, 1989), without relying on the respondent!s
(generally inaccurate) introspection (Fischhoff,
1988).
3.2. Research instrument and experimental design
To identify the pertinent attributes, we asked
VCs outside the sample of the study (primarily
VCs based in Chicago and New York) to provide
actual investment decision scenarios, complete
with business plans. From these plans, the lead
researcher extracted information factors of interest, providing the entire list, with a description of
each factor, to a colleague unfamiliar with the
business plans. Both judges then independently
coded all appropriate attributes. Value ranges
given to each attribute allowed it to be compared
across profiles (Stewart, 1988). For attributes of
the new venture!s management team (general
leadership experience, market familiarity, and
experience with start-ups), values are defined as
averages for the whole management team. When
possible, we used concrete values (e.g., market
size), but representative distributions are appropriate for subjective attributes (Stewart, 1988). For
the two subjective information factors (proprietary
technology and competitor strength), we used a
five-point scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).
Overall, inter-judge reliability was 87.5%. Based
on Berelson!s (1952) report that inter-judge reliability typically ranges from 66% to 95%, we deem
our coding reliable.
3.3. Sampling plan, survey method, and sample

3. Research method
3.1. Policy capturing
This study uses policy capturing, a technique
that requires respondents to make a series of

The sample for this experiment was 41 practicing VCs from three entrepreneurial ‘‘hotbeds,’’ (1)
the Colorado Front Range (primarily the Denver/
Boulder metro area), (2) the Silicon Valley in
California, and (3) Boston. The Colorado and
California data was collected in 1995 and the

<-----Page 6----->A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

Boston data was collected in 1998 using the same
instrument. 4 The typical VC in the sample was
male (90%), 42 years old (range 29 to 72;
s.d. ¼ 11.7), had a master!s degree (most likely in
business), and had been a VC for 9 years (s.d. 6.6).
The typical firm for which the VC worked had
$215 million under management (range $2 million
to $5 billion; s.d. ¼ $323 million), employed 14
investment professional (range 1–65; s.d ¼ 16.6),
focused primarily on early stage ventures, had
been in business for 13.3 years (range 1–32;
s.d. ¼ 7.8), and invested $4.1 million per venture
(s.d. ¼ 3.9). This sample is relatively representative
of the US VC community as a whole, although
slightly biased towards the more successful, wellknown firms. For example, 7 of the 10 top VC
firms that invest in early stage deals, as rated on 10
metrics, are represented in the sample (Aragon,
2001) and the sample firms tend to be larger
($215M versus $155M for population [Venture
Economics, 2000]).
3.4. Independent variables, levels, and dependent
variable
The experimental design required each VC to
assess 50 randomized ventures on eight attributes
(see Appendix A for a sample profile). To supplement the 20 actual venture scenarios, we used a
random case generator from Policy PC software
package (Executive Decision Services, 1991),
which creates a manageable number of statistically
derived cases. MANOVA verifies that the statistical cases are from the same population as the actual cases. The independent variables have equal
variance between real and generated cases and the
multi-variate means are equivalent. Furthermore,
a consulting expert VC identified those cases that
were not feasible (i.e., combination of cue values
that rarely occurs in reality). Infeasible scenarios

4
We conducted a post hoc test that included a dummy
variable for the collection dates (0 for 1995 and 1 for 1998) and
found that the results did not differ substantially from those
reported below. This suggests that the decision policies of the
VCs who participated in 1995 did not differ substantially from
those that participated in 1998.

679

were dropped from the sample of potential candidates.
Five of the original profiles were replicated to
allow a test–retest measure of reliability. The
independent variables (attributes assigned to the
venture scenarios) were derived from previous
studies (e.g., Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; MacMillan
et al., 1985). The eight attributes were leadership
experience (average number of years of experience
the management team has in leadership positions),
proprietary technology (on a five-point scale
ranging from no protection to extremely high
proprietary protection), market familiarity (mean
number of years experience team has in market),
start-up record (mean number of past start-up
experiences for team members), market size (total
revenues for most recent year), market growth
(percentage growth in revenues over last five
years), number of competitors (number of direct
competitors), and competitor strength (relative
concentration of market on a five-point scale
ranging from a few dominant competitors to an
emerging market). The instructions specified that
all attributes not included in the experiment were
to be presumed constant across all venture profiles.
Rate of return is an appropriate dependent
variable for VCs! decisions (Roure and Keeley,
1990). Therefore, the dependent variable for this
experiment is the VC!s assessment of how likely
the venture is to succeed, as measured on a sevenpoint Likert Scale anchored by ‘‘10· or more on
investment’’ and ‘‘complete loss of investment.’’
The more assessments each participant completes, the higher the reliability and stability of the
results yet too many profiles may tire the judge and
limit participation. A rule of thumb is to have a
minimum of five profiles for every attribute being
tested (Executive Decision Services, 1991). Five
cases times eight attributes equals 40 cases. In
addition, we had five repeated cases to assess response reliability. We rounded the number to 50
profiles. Fatigue is unlikely to be of concern in this
experiment. First, the number of attributes in each
treatment was relatively low (Hitt et al. (2000) had
30 profiles with 14 attributes), and the mean time
taken to complete the experiment was less than 30
minutes. Second, the order of the profiles was

<-----Page 7----->680

A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

randomized for each experiment, and the results
were consistent across individuals. Third, individuals were relatively consistent in their responses
(test–retest reliability of 72% is comparable with
Shepherd!s (1999) 69%).
3.5. Building a non-additive decision-aid
To test Hypothesis 6 we need to construct a
main-effects-only decision-aid and a non-additive
decision-aid. First, a main-effects-only aid uses the
eight identified attributes and the aggregate standardized coefficients derived from our sample of
VCs.
Y ¼ b1 ðleadÞ þ b2 ðfamÞ þ b3 ðstart-upÞ þ b4 ðpropÞ
þ b5 ðsizeÞ þ b6 ðgrowÞ þ b7 ðcompÞ
þ b8 ðstrengthÞ;

where lead is the leadership experience, fam,
market familiarity, start-up, start-up record, prop,
proprietary technology, size, market size, grow,
market growth, comp, number of competitors,
strength, competitor strength.
The second decision-aid is based on a nonadditive model using all eight attributes and leadership!s interaction with each other attribute.
Y ¼ b1 ðleadÞ þ b2 ðfamÞ þ b3 ðstart-upÞ þ b4 ðpropÞ
þ b5 ðsizeÞ þ b6 ðgrowÞ þ b7 ðcompÞ

þ b8 ðstrengthÞ þ b9 ðlead % famÞ
þ b10 ðlead % start-upÞ þ b11 ðlead % propÞ

þ b12 ðlead % sizeÞ þ b13 ðlead % growÞ
þ b14 ðlead % compÞ þ b15 ðlead % strengthÞ:
The models are tested on those 20 cases (out of
50) that were based on actual ventures and that
received funding and had a measurable outcome.
Seventy percent of the actual cases were successful
(achieving a realized return on investment [ROI] of
15% or greater [Dean and Giglierano, 1990]), 30%
of the ventures resulted in an ROI of less than 15%
or complete loss of investment. Considering that
the 70/30 ratio veers from the norm of most VC
portfolios where approximately 40–60% provide a
favorable return (Timmons, 1999), we also tested
the models against a distribution of actual cases
that included 50% success and 50% failure leaving

us with 12 actual cases. We excluded those cases
with the highest ROI (retaining the six success
cases closest to the 15% success breakpoint) because this represents a more conservative test for
discriminating success from failures. 5 Failures
were dummy coded 0 and successes dummy coded
1.
The models! predictions coincided with the seven-point Likert scale used as the dependent variable. If the model!s prediction ranged from 4.5 to
7, it was coded as a success. Failure predictions
ranged from 1 to 3.49 and neither success or failure
ranged from 3.5 to 4.49. Predictions of success
were dummy coded 1, predictions of failure were
dummy coded 0, and predictions of neither success
nor failure were not included in subsequent analyses.
To determine decision accuracy, the VC!s predictions were compared to the actual outcome,
either a success or a failure. VCs! predictions were
recoded from a seven-point scale to success, failure, or neither success nor failure. Predictions of
success were operationalized by scores of 5, 6, and
7, predictions of failure by scores of 1, 2, and 3,
predictions of neither success nor failure by a score
of 4. Each prediction was scored a 1 if it matched
the actual outcome and 0 if it did not. We calculated the accuracy rate as a ratio of total predictions correct to the total number of predictions.
This procedure was repeated for each VC and for
each model.
We then compared the accuracy rate for the
main-effect model with the accuracy rate of each
VC. If the main-effect model!s accuracy rate was
higher than a particular VC then we recorded a 1
and if it was lower then we recorded a 0. The
number of ties were recorded but not used in
subsequent analyses. A chi-squared test was used
to test whether the main-effect model more often
outperformed the VCs. The same procedure and
test was used for comparing the accuracy of the
non-additive model with all VCs.

5
Using only 12 cases did not change the accuracy of the
non-additive model (60%). The main-effects model improved by
5% (45–50%) and the mean for the VCs actual decisions
improved by less than 1%.

4. Results
Table 1 provides an intercorrelation matrix and
specifies the mean and standard deviations for
each variable. The experiment provides 50 observations per VC and therefore 1900 observations
for the sample. While this means that there are a
large number of degrees of freedom for the subsequent analysis, there may be autocorrelation
because the assessments on these 50 observations
are nested within individuals. HLM accounts for
variance among individuals such that the 1900
observations can be considered independent––this
technique is well suited for analyzing nested data.
We generated both a main-effects-only model and
a non-additive model, the results of which are
displayed in Table 2. 6,7
Presented in the top section of Table 2 are the
coefficients (from HLM of standardized values),
and corresponding standard error, t-ratio and
levels of significance for the main-effects-only

6

We also ran regression analysis for each individual using
mean centered variables. We found an aggregated mean R2 of
0.62 and that multi-collinearity was unlikely to have impacted
the regression results (all VIFs were under 3 which is well below
10––the rule of thumb for acceptable VIFs).
7
We tested for differences in decision policies among the
sample of VCs. Age and VC experience were a priori the
demographic variables mostly likely to distinguish between
decision policies. We included these two level two variables in a
HLM analysis to determine if those that are older or more
experienced had a significantly different decision policy than
those that were younger or less experienced. We did not find
any significant differences.

and weaker (coefficient ¼ )0.30; p < 0:01) competitors. It appears that VCs do not significantly
use start-up experience (coefficient ¼ 0.02; p >

The coefficients, and corresponding standard
error, t-ratio and level of significance for the nonadditive model are presented in the lower section
of Table 2. In the non-additive model, the significant variables are leadership (coefficient ¼ 0.41;
p < 0:01), proprietary technology (coefficient ¼
0.17; p < 0:01), market familiarity (coefficient ¼
0.29; p < 0:01), market growth (coefficient ¼ 0.30;
p < 0:01), and number of competitors (coefficient
¼ )0.49; p < 0:01), and the interactions between
leadership experience and start-up experience
(coefficient ¼ )0.22; p < 0:01), leadership experience and market size (coefficient ¼ 0.27; p < 0:01),
leadership and number of competitors (coefficient ¼ 0.24; p < 0:05), and leadership and competitor strength (coefficient ¼ )0.30; p < 0:01).
For internal resources, the interaction between
leadership and start-up experience was significant
(coefficient ¼ 0.20; p < 0:01). Start-up experience
moderates the relationship between leadership
experience and the VC!s assessment of success. The
form of this interaction is plotted in Fig. 1 and
indicates that while VCs always prefer more leadership experience, that preference is greater when
start-up experience is low. It appears that start-up
experience is a substitute for general leadership
experience rather than a complement as proposed
in Hypothesis 3. Hypotheses 1 and 2, which posited leadership!s interaction with proprietary technology (coefficient ¼ 0.01; p > 0:05), and market
familiarity (coefficient ¼ )0.13; p > 0:05), were not
supported.
Leadership experience interacts with market
size (coefficient ¼ 0.27; p < 0:01), number of competitors (coefficient ¼ 0.24; p < 0:05), and competitor strength (coefficient ¼ )0.30; p < 0:01). The
nature of the interactions is plotted in Figs. 2–4. In
all cases, VCs prefer greater leadership experience.

The accuracy of VCs and the main-effect model
are close to what we would expect simply by
chance. To determine if the non-additive model is
accurate more often than chance we conducted a
post hoc test. We used a random generator to
produce 456 values with a value of either 0 or 1
and a probability of 0.50. These values were used
as replacements for the predictions of each VC
(i.e., the first 12 randomly generated values represented the predictions of the first VC, the second
12 the second VC, and so on). We then compared
the accuracy of the non-additive model to each of
the VCs, as above. We found that the non-additive
model outperformed predictions at random 76%
of the time, under-performed VCs 21% of the time,
and was equal with VCs 3% of time. The nonadditive is more accurate than chance predictions
(chi-squared ¼ 11.92; p ¼ 0:001).

Decision-aids appear to improve decision performance. The main-effect model had an accuracy

5. Discussion
The two major contributions of the study are
that VCs! decision policies are indeed non-additive
and a non-additive decision-aid improves decision
accuracy over and above the VCs! actual decisions.
Moreover, the paper illustrates the power of using
theory, RBV, to generate the key attributes and
predict and explain interaction effects not only in
capturing VCs! decision policies but also in
building powerful decision-aids.
5.1. Non-additive decision policies
We find that VCs use non-additive decision
policies; the more munificent the environment
(large market and weaker competitors), the more
importance the VC attaches to general experience

<-----Page 11----->684

A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

in leadership. Somewhat surprisingly, it appears
that start-up experience is a substitute for general
leadership experience. The greater the entrepreneur!s previous start-up experience, the less
important is his/her general leadership experience.
Considering that start-up experience isn!t significant in the main-effects model, it is possible that
VCs look at leadership experience first; if it is
weak, they may consider start-up experience as
compensating for weaker leadership experience.
The finding that start-up experience substitutes for
leadership experience adds to our understanding
of VCs! decision policies over and above those
studies that find for the main-effect-only use of
these attributes and may explain the contradictory
findings in previous studies.
The interaction between leadership and number
of competitors was opposite of what we hypothesized (see Fig. 3). VCs place greater emphasis on
leadership experience in environments that have a
greater number of competitors. A possible explanation is that an increasing number of competitors
(holding other attributes of environmental munificence constant) increases the VC!s reliance on a
leader to act and react to the many possible, and a
priori unforeseeable, competitive interactions, i.e.,
rely on the leader!s tactical ability. Moreover, VCs
may like to see other competitors as it validates the
opportunity!s existence.
We know that decision makers typically rely
more on main-effect relationships and less on nonadditive relationships (Louviere, 1988). While this
appears to be the case in this study we argue that
these two-way interactions are likely to be important in an absolute sense owing to the significant
cost (in both outlay and opportunity) of an
incorrect assessment. That is, considering nonadditive relationships may critically affect the
ultimate financial performance of the VC!s portfolio and leads to this paper!s second contribution.
5.2. Decision-aids with non-additive relationships
VC is an industry predicated on hitting
‘‘homeruns;’’ investments that can generate 10
times the investment or more. In a typical portfolio of companies, a VC expects to hit only one or
two homeruns out of 10 investments. Even mar-

ginal improvements in investment decisions can
have a dramatic impact on portfolio performance.
In this article, we found evidence that decision-aids
constructed from bootstrap models have the potential to improve VCs! decision accuracy and
thereby increase a VC firm!s return on investment.
Specifically, a non-additive decision-aid, a decision-aid based on a bootstrap model that incorporated interaction terms for leadership with all
other attributes, had a higher hit rate in accurately
‘‘picking winners’’ from a sample of 12 ventures
than did the VCs! actual decisions. The improvement in decision accuracy from using a decision-aid
occurs because bootstrap models are consistent,
they are not biased by a non-random sample,
they optimally weight information factors, and
they reduce the decision-maker!s cognitive load
(Camerer, 1981).
Although we only used a sample of 12 cases
with known outcomes, our findings provide some
evidence that decision-aids could be a useful
technique to help VCs with their investment decision and possibly improve a VC firm!s return on
investment. The decision-aid we have developed
relies on theory and past decisions of practicing
VCs. This generic model demonstrates the power
of VC decision-aids, but to achieve a competitive
advantage, VC firms may benefit from fully specifying a firm specific decision-aid based upon the
accumulated knowledge and expertise of its VC
professionals.
Shepherd and Zacharakis (2002) argued that
decision-aids also allow VCs to acquire expertise
faster than do current educational and training
methods––decision-aids can provide cognitive
feedback, which is some measure of the person!s
cognitive processes used in the decision. Cognitive
feedback helps people come to terms with their
decision environment and has been found to be
markedly superior to outcome feedback. While
outcome feedback is often an effective learning
mechanism, in the venture investment decision
outcome feedback is delayed detracting from the
learning experience; it takes many years for VCs to
earn a return on their investment. Furthermore,
outcome feedback can be costly. The VC may
learn because a portfolio company has burned
through the investment and failed. Cognitive

<-----Page 12----->A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

feedback has the potential to minimize these costs
because the learning takes place before investments are made.
Although we have demonstrated the potential of
decision-aids to improve a VC!s decision accuracy
and others have suggested that it can be used as a
learning tool, decision-aids have not been widely
adopted by VCs. In our sample, only 20% of the
VCs used some sort of multi-attribute decision-aid.
Often, these decision-aids were used ex post as a
mechanism to keep the history of decisions made.
The culture within the industry is to use expert
intuition (Khan, 1987). There is an underlying
distrust of ‘‘machine’’ that inhibits adoption of
such techniques across a wider array of fields (Holt,
1986). A common explanation of this reluctance is
that decision models remove responsibility for the
decision (Hastie, 1994). Although a decision-aid
might be able to predict psychosis, is the psychologist willing to take responsibility if the model is
wrong? Or would the psychologist feel better if
(s)he made that final decision even if there is potential for more mistakes? In today!s litigious
society, one has to wonder if malpractice insurance
would cover the misdiagnosis of a decision-aid
built from a bootstrap model. Such questions pose
an interesting quandary that may explain the low
usage of such models and the tendency to identify
‘‘broken legs’’ or exceptions that invalidate the
model (Goldberg, 1968).
Recognizing the reluctance to use such models, it
seems that the most appropriate place within the
VC decision process to begin would be at the initial
screening stage. The decision-aid proposed here
quickly focuses attention on the critical issues
thereby saving the VCs time and reducing the possibility that ‘‘high potential’’ plans are prematurely
discarded and that ‘‘low potential’’ plans are needlessly passed on to the next level of analysis. Such
use of the decision-aid also does not remove the
VC!s control or responsibility over the decision. The
decision-aid is to assist VCs, not replace them. In
fact, there is evidence to suggest that a combination
of human judgment and decision models results in
more accurate decisions than either method alone
(Whitecotton et al., 1998; Blattberg and Hoch,
1990; Donihue, 1993). While the research in this
article takes an important step towards highlighting

685

the importance of decision-aids for VCs, more research is required into the development of decisionaids and their use within VC firms.
5.3. Future research
This study uses the RBV of strategy to
hypothesize leadership!s interaction with other
venture and environmental characteristics. However, we are not proposing that the RBV is the
only perspective that can provide insight into VCs!
decision policies, in fact we encourage the investigation of VCs! decisions from a number of different theoretical perspectives. The Industrial
Organization (IO) perspective of strategy, for
example, could provide additional insight into the
relationships between important industry characteristics (some of which are represented in this
study). Not only may the use of different theories
provide a deeper understanding of VCs! decision
policies but these different theories could also
provide avenues for VCs to improve the accuracy
of their assessments. For example, a different theoretical perspective may suggest other non-additive relationships that will increase the explained
variance of VCs! assessments. Similarly, using
theoretical frameworks to study the decision policies of expert VCs might provide important feedback to current theories suggesting the need for
theory modifications and/or new theories.
While this study provides evidence that decisionaids have the potential to improve decision accuracy and VC firm performance, there is also an
opportunity to improve the decision-aid proposed
here by representing other interactions and even
curvilinear relationships. For example, maybe there
is a U-shaped relationship between the number of
competitors and VCs! assessment of success, i.e., a
small number of competitors could be interpreted
by VCs as a negative because the industry lacks
legitimacy although too much competition might be
seen as a negative because it drives down prices and
profitability. Do VCs! use non-linear decision policies? Can these non-linear decision policies be
incorporated into a decision-aid to significantly
increase a VC!s decision accuracy?
This study focuses on VCs! assessment on new
ventures, i.e., investment proposals seeking seed to

<-----Page 13----->686

A. Zacharakis, D.A. Shepherd / European Journal of Operational Research 162 (2005) 673–689

development capital. An interesting question then
becomes––do VCs weight criteria differently in
their assessments of businesses in different stages
of development (e.g., mezzanine financing or leveraged buyouts)? Also, while the environmental
factors in this study likely capture industry differences, there is the opportunity to create a sample
of VCs that are experts in a particular industry and
model their decisions based on the scenarios specific to that industry. Whether for a different stage
of venture development or for specific industries,
there is the opportunity to create more narrowly
focused decision-aids in attempt to further improve decision accuracy.
Scholars face a number of challenges. First,
these decision-aids can only improve VC firm
performance if they are used. Why are only 20% of
VCs (based on our sample) using some form of
multi-attribute decision-aid? What are the obstacles for its use? What are effective means to overcome these obstacles? Second, it is difficult to
measure the decision accuracy of a VCs! assessment of a venture!s future success. Reflecting these
difficulties decision-aid scholars have used process
measures of decision quality, such as, reliability
(Ashton, 1983), consensus (Einhorn, 1974), and
performance relative to a bootstrap standard
(Camerer, 1981). We argue that both process and
outcome measures can be used to measure the
quality of decisions but researchers should also
investigate the inter-relationship between the two.
5.4. Possible limitations
Policy capturing, as with all techniques, has
limitations, although throughout the design and
administration of this study, attempts were made
to minimize these limitations. Nonetheless, a few
of the drawbacks should be addressed. As with any
experiment, the issue of reductionism must be
considered. Although the scenarios are based on
actual firms that received venture backing, the
subjects are exposed to a decision situation that
does not perfectly mirror the ‘‘real life’’ decision.
Such ‘‘paper tests’’ affect the external validity of
many lens model experiments (Brehmer and
Brehmer, 1988). But ‘‘professional judgment
may . . . involve some abstract coding of the cues,

similar to that provided by policy capturing tasks’’
(Brehmer and Brehmer, 1988, p. 89). Moreover,
since the VC screening decision has a large
‘‘paper’’ component in the real world (i.e., much of
the VC!s information comes from business plans),
correlation between the experimental task and the
‘‘real world’’ decision should be even higher.
The experiment also forces VCs to make decisions based upon the presented cues. In reality,
VCs would (1) have access to a multitude of possible information cues and (2) use interactive due
diligence and other methods to clarify and assess
reliability of chosen cues. A common theme in the
follow up interviews is that VCs like to reserve
final judgment until they have a chance to meet
with the lead entrepreneur. There is also the possibility that respondents could attach importance
to attributes merely because they are presented in
the experiment; this limitation is more likely with
novice decision makers than with the experienced
venture capitalists sampled here. Therefore, while
the information within the decision exercise does
not perfectly mirror the more complex ‘‘real life’’
decision, policy capturing experiments are still a
valid method for deriving what information decision-makers actually use (Hitt et al., 2000; Hitt
and Middlemist, 1979). While these criticisms of
policy capturing have merit and do represent limitations of the technique, our approach is consistent with that of other policy capturing studies
(e.g., Hitt and Tyler, 1991) and the construction of
bootstrap models.
It is also important to point out that after the
decision is made the outcome is normally delayed
for a number of years (Timmons, 1999). There is a
history effect as the entrepreneur adjusts the original plan. Moreover, Gupta and Sapienza (1992)
point out that VCs not only provide financial resources, but also non-financial resources such as
advice, network contacts to suppliers, customers
and so forth. These services are typically offered
after the investment has been made and before the
VC realizes any return from their investment. 8
Furthermore, environments are in constant flux

The fact that the cases were all VC-backed somewhat
controls for the history effect.

and change from the point of the original investment. In spite of the history effects, our decisionaid achieved a hit rate of 60%. In sum, we believe
this is a good first test of the power of non-additive
decision-aids in the VC context.

687

finding of non-additive decision policies and the
improvements in decision performance from nonadditive decision-aids encourages decision-aid
scholars to consider incorporating interaction
terms in their models and encourages VC firms to
consider the possibilities that decision-aids offer.

5.5. Conclusion
The current study makes two important contributions to the literature on VC decision-making.
First, it uses theory to hypothesize and support the
contention that VCs use interaction terms in
making their decisions. Second, the paper builds a
non-additive decision-aid that better predicts outcome than VCs actual predictions. The implications are clear. VC firms may improve portfolio
return and create a competitive advantage by
developing a non-additive decision-aid based upon
the expertise of its senior VCs. We hope that the
