<-----Page 0----->Interpersonal Trust, Trustworthiness,
and Gullibility
JULIAN B. ROTTER

ABSTRACT: This article reviews the positive and
potential negative consequences of being high or low
in interpersonal trust in current social life, particularly
in interacting with ordinary people. A summary and
analysis of many investigations lead to the following
conclusions applicable to the population studied:
People who trust more are less likely to lie and are
possibly less likely to cheat or steal. They are more
likely to give others a second chance and to respect
the rights of others. The high truster is less likely to
be unhappy, conflicted, or maladjusted, and is liked
more and sought out as a friend more often, both by
low-trusting and high-trusting others. When gullibility
is defined as naivete or foolishness and trust is defined
as believing others in the absence of clear-cut reasons
to disbelieve, then it can be shown over a series of
studies that high trusters are not more gullible than
low trusters.

A recent New York Times editorial referred to
the present time as "the age of suspicion." Focusing on the political costs of excessive distrust,
the editors expressed the hope that Americans
might return to a more trusting attitude toward
their government and themselves. An equally
forceful plea might be made in terms of the enormous personal costs of excessive distrust. Common sense tells us that interpersonal trust is an
important variable affecting human relationships
at all levels: relationships between governments,
between minorities and majorities, buyers and
sellers, patients and therapists, parents and children, and so on. As distrust increases, the social
fabric disintegrates. Unwarranted distrust can result in serious negative'consequences, but "foolish
trust," or gullibility, can also lead to serious consequences. We need to ask two questions: What
is unwarranted distrust? And what are the costs of
trusting too much?" Although psychologists cannot be expected to provide definitive answers to
such complex questions, we can address ourselves
to aspects of the problem.

About 14 years ago at the University of Connecticut, a program of research dealing with interpersonal trust was begun. The present report
deals with some of this research involving the personal consequences of being high or low in interpersonal trust. Most psychologists have to answer
the question of how trusting they should be, not
only in making decisions about their personal lives
but also in deciding about their roles as teachers,
therapists, and parents. How trusting we are is
important to others as well as to ourselves, since
some of our research strongly suggests that modeling and direct teaching are the most potent forces
in developing high- or low-trusting beliefs in children (Into, 1969; Katz & Rotter, 1969).
In the context of social learning theory, interpersonal trust has been denned as a generalized
expectancy held by an individual that the word,
promise, oral or written statement of another individual or group can be relied on (Rotter, 1967).
This definition differs from that of other psychologists who define trust as a belief in the goodness
of others or in the benign nature of the world.
If expectancies that others' communications can
be relied on are generalized from one social agent
to another, then the individual will build up a
generalized expectancy for trust of others that
might be viewed as a relatively stable personality
characteristic. In our original research we attempted to determine whether such generalized,
relatively stable expectancies for trusting others
exist and can be reliably measured, and we have
found considerable support for the utility of such

is necessary at this point to describe what is meant
by a generalized expectancy and its place in social
learning theory (Rotter, 1954; Rotter, Chance, &
Phares, 1972).
In social learning theory expectancies in each
situation are determined not only by specific experiences in that situation but also, to some varying degree, by experiences in other situations that
the individual perceives as similar. One of the determinants of the relative importance of generalized expectancies, as opposed to specific expectancies, in a given situation is the amount of experience one has had in that particular situation.
These points are emphasized because, for some
people, the idea of a generalized expectancy means
an assumption that there is no situational specificity. Of course there is both situational specificity and cross-situational generality determining
behavior, and the relative importance of each depends on the amount of previous experience with
the particular situation being considered. , It also
follows that if one is trying to get a good measure
of a generalized expectancy, one should avoid
stimuli with which the individual has had a great
deal of previous, specific experience, such as father,
mother, lover, and friend, and one should try
instead to -sample widely from a large number of
social agents. So it is the trust of a generalized
other—a person or group with whom one has not
had a (great deal of personal experience—in which
we are most interested.
In order to measure such a generalized expectancy, we developed a questionnaire that has
shown construct validity in predicting attitudinal,
sociometric, behavioral, and unobtrusive criteria
in a variety of situations (Rotter, 1967, 1971);
that is, consistent, with theoretical expectations,
a moderate portion of the variance was predicted
by this test for these criteria. Most correlations
have been in the .30s and .40s. In the great
majority of these studies, the Interpersonal Trust
Scale was administered by someone other than the
experimenter and was separated in time from the
criterion situation by periods ranging from one to
four months. This temporal separation of test administration and experimental criterion situation
was maintained in all the investigations discussed
below, with a few specified exceptions.
Below, I first examine the positive relationships
or consequences of being a high truster, and later
I deal with the question of the negative relation2 • JANUARY 1980 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST

ships or consequences, particularly the issue of
gullibility.

Trust and Prasocial Behavior
Previously reported research (Rotter, 1971) has
documented the strong relationship between high
trust and trustworthiness. Whether the criterion
is a self-report questionnaire or behavior in a controlled experiment, people who act more trusting
or say they are more trusting are themselves less
likely to lie.
In addition to lying, other behavioral indicators
of trustworthiness and lack of trustworthiness have
been studied. For example, it is reasonable to
expect that some people are more likely than
others to behave in an untrustworthy fashion in
situations in which the perceived risk of being
caught in the act is minimal.
In an experiment whose primary focus was the
investigation of sex guilt, Boroto (1970) obtained
the interesting incidental finding that subjects who
did not invade the privacy of the experimenter
when they did not think they were being observed
were very high on interpersonal trust.
Steinke (1975) tested subjects on a task in
which it was possible for the experimenter to
detect cheating without directly observing the
subjects. Subjects .were tested in groups of four
and were told that they were competing with one
another and with other subjects in the experiment
for a monetary prize to be awarded when the experiment was completed. When the Peer subscale
of the Interpersonal Trust Scale was used to divide
subjects into high and low trusters, it was found
that low trusters had cheated significantly more
often than had high trusters.
In another study, subjects' belief that they were
being observed was experimentally manipulated.
Hochreich (Note 1) asked subjects to practice on
a series of boring and repetitive arithmetic problems for 10 minutes as preparation for a related
test. In one condition, each subject was told that
the experimenter would be in an adjacent room,
behind an observation window, while the subject
worked on the practice problems. In a second
condition, the observation window was present but
the subject was told the experimenter would wait
down the hall. In the third condition, there was
no observation window in the room and the subject was told the experimenter would wait down
the hall. Among females, high trusters worked as
hard, that is, completed the same number of

<-----Page 2----->problems, regardless of whether they believed that
the experimenter was watching them. Low trusters, on the other hand, worked significantly less
hard when they believed they were not being observed than when they believed the experimenter
was. behind the one-way mirror. In the surveillance condition, they worked as hard as hightrusting females; in the no-surveillance conditions,
they worked less hard than did high trustees. No
such pattern of differences was obtained for males
for reasons that are not clear but are probably
related to different attitudes of males and females
toward the arithmetic task.
Wright and Kirmani (1977) surveyed a large
number of high school students and had them
complete an anonymous questionnaire, as well as
the Interpersonal Trust Scale and items dealing
with a number of social attitudes. They also included self-reports of shoplifting.
Although,
overall, females admitted to less shoplifting than
did males, female low trusters reported significantly more shoplifting than did female high
trusters. Wright and Kirmani also asked whether
the subjects felt that people in the two surrounding communities distrusted students. The low
trusters of both sexes showed significantly greater
feelings of being distrusted, and this item was
significantly related to frequency of shoplifting.
Of course, the relationship between low trust
and untrustworthy behavior seems readily explainable. If low trusters truly feel that other people
cannot be trusted, there is less moral pressure on
them to tell the truth, and under some circumstances they may feel that lying, cheating, and
similar behaviors are necessary for defensive reasons—because everybody else is doing it to them.
Most of the work reported above has been done
with college students, and the generalizability of
these findings to other populations is not known.
It may seem that the interpretation of these studies is leading to good guy —bad guy stereotypes,
but that may be due to the nature of the variable
we have been investigating and to the logical criteria that variable predicts. We do have some
data which suggest that high trusters may be more
conventional and more moralistic than low trusters.
These attributes, at least, are not necessarily positive ones.
In addition to trustworthiness and moral behavior, there are other concomitants or consequences of trust that may be of interest, namely,
personal adjustment and likability. In six of the

studies we have done with college students, scores
on the Incomplete Sentences Blank, a semistructured test of college student adjustment or conflict, were available. In all six studies, higher
trust was significantly related to better adjustment
for the total sample of the study. The correlations
ranged from .20 to .44. These findings are in general agreement with those of Collins and Wrightsman (1926), who found a similar relationship between trust and adjustment with 12-IS-year-old
boys, using other measures of trust and adjustment.
Before describing the investigations of gullibility, I should mention one other recently completed study, which dealt with the positive consequences of being more trusting. Hochreich (Note
2) asked a large number of subjects, male and
female, high and low trusters, simply to read a test
protocol of the Interpersonal Trust Scale, presumably filled out by a real subject. The name
at the top of the protocol indicated that the person who had taken the scale was either a male
or a female, and the scale was answered either in
a trusting or, a distrusting direction. After reading
the protocol, subjects were asked to rate the target person on a number of characteristics. Hochreich's results were surprising. Byrne (1971) and
his colleagues have repeatedly demonstrated that
there is a strong tendency for people to like others
who are similar to themselves in attitudes, opinions, and personality' characteristics, but Hochreich found that in general, everyone likes a high
truster. More specifically, regardless of the sex
of either the subject or the target person, thehigh truster was seen as being happier, more
ethical, and more attractive to the opposite sex, as
having had a happier childhood, and as more desirable as a close friend than the low-trust target.
There was strong agreement among all subjects
on many of these ratings, but some of the other
findings indicated that subjects were not responding in a simpleminded, nondiscriminating fashion.
For example, all subjects believed that the lowtrust target was more likely than the high-trust
target to have had varied and unusual experiences. Overall, too, the low-trust target was seen
as having more common sense than the high-trust
target, though this difference was significant only
for subjects who were themselves low in trust.
There was no overall effect for ratings of academic
ability, .although female high trusters did rate the
high-trust target as significantly higher on this
variable.

<-----Page 3----->Trust and Gullibility
So much for the positive concomitants, or consequences of being a high truster. What can be
said about the possible negative consequences of
being taken in too much, of being gullible?
Before considering the relationship of gullibility
to interpersonal trust, some refinement of the concept of trust has to be made. If trust is simply
believing communications, then high trust must be
equated with gullibility. However, if we redefine
trust as believing communications in the absence
of clear or strong reasons for not believing (i.e., in
ambiguous situations) and gullibility as believing
when most people of the same social group would
consider belief naive and foolish, then trust can
be independent of gullibility. In fact, anecdotal
evidence suggests that it is the low truster who is
taken in by the disarming dishonesty of the con
artist and is the frequent victim of con games.
It may also be true that the belief of the high
truster is more a belief in the moral Tightness of
trust of the stranger than it is an expectancy of
less risk in trusting others. The studies already
reviewed clearly suggest that the high truster is
more likely than the low truster to act morally.
Gullibility has been denned as naivete or foolishness. To translate that into experimental criteria is not always easy. In the studies how to
be reviewed, gullibility was defined as believing
another person when there was some clear-cut
evidence that the person should not be believed.
Either the other person had already lied to the
subject one or more times, or most people would
consider that person's statement to be implausible
on other grounds. To trust a stranger who has
not lied to you before would not be gullibility;
to believe a politician who has lied to you many
times before is gullibility.
In several of our earlier investigations no evidence was found that high trusters behaved in a
way that can be called, somewhat arbitrarily perhaps, more gullible than low trusters. Of course,
there are problems in trying to prove the null
hypothesis. However, in reviewing these studies
and some others to be described, there are considerations that at any rate increase the plausibility of the idea that, overall, high trusters are
no more gullible than-low trusters.
It appears to me that there are four criteria
that can be applied in estimating the probability
that the null hypothesis can be accepted. First,
is the criterion behavior measured reliably? Sec4 • JANUARY 1980 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST

ond, is the criterion behavior valid? That'is, is
there evidence that it can be predicted by or
related to other variables in a logical way? Third,
are there a number of investigations with different
subjects and different operations that have produced similar results? And fourth, are the statistically nonsignificant differences in various studies
not all in the same direction?
In other words, if one can show in a series of investigations in which two groups did not differ
significantly that the criterion behaviors were reliably measured, the criterion behaviors could be
logically predicted by other variables, the subject
populations were varied as were the criteria, and
the nonsignificant differences were not always in
the same direction, then one can assert that one
has produced evidence increasing the probability
that the null hypothesis can be accepted.
For example, we can apply these criteria to
Rotter's (1967) sociometric study. In this study
of college fraternity and sorority members who
had lived with each other for at least six months,
the Interpersonal Trust Scale did correlate .38
with the sociometric ratings of interpersonal trust;
in this case the two measures were given in the
same experimental session. However, there was
no significant relationship between the Interpersonal Trust Scale or the sociometric rating of
trust and the sociometric ratings of gullibility,
where gullibility was defined as being "naive and
, easily fooled." Ratings for sociometric variables
were highly reliable, and the sociometric ratings
of dependency were highly related to gullibility.
The latter relationship was significantly higher
than that between gullibility and any other
variable.
A study by Geller (1966) involved a faulty
apparatus that had ostensibly just delivered a
strong shock to the experimenter. Following his
shock the experimenter took a few seconds to
"fix" the apparatus and then told the subject it
was all right. Geller had three conditions. In
the first condition, subjects had no prior reason
to be suspicious. In the second, involving a mildly
suspicious group, the subjects had previously gone
through an Asch conformity situation with the
same experimenter. In the third condition, subjects had been told by a confederate that they had
been deceived by the experimenter in the Asch
situation.
The three groups differed as expected in the
behavioral trust shown toward the apparatus.

<-----Page 4----->Trusting behavior was reliably rated by two observers behind a one-way vision screen. Hightrust subjects were significantly more trusting than
low-trust subjects in the first condition but were
no more trusting behaviorally in the third, deception-revealed condition. In other words, the
criterion behavior could be shown to be a reliable
and valid measure of trust, but high-trust subjects Were no more gullible than low-trust subjects, once the former had a strong reason to distrust the experimenter.
Two studies involving game behavior, by Wright
(1972) and Hamsher (1968), are also relevant to
the study of trust and gullibility. Both of these
involved passing notes to another player; the
notes were intercepted by the experimenter, who
substituted his own. After being deceived once
before and with no apology, high and low trusters
did not differ significantly in their subsequent trust
of the other subject. Both of these studies also
met the criteria proposed above for a valid test of
the null hypothesis. In the four studies referred
to above, two of the nonsignificant differences in
gullibility between high and low trusters favored
high trusters, and two favored low trusters.
There are some additional data that bear, perhaps less directly, on the gullibility of high
trusters. Some people, obviously low trusters, believe that high trusters are just plain dumb. We
do not have individual intelligence tests on our
subjects, but we do have college aptitude scores
and in one study a range of educational attainment. In several of our studies, we have correlated scholastic aptitude scores with trust scores
and have in each case found a nonsignificant relationship. Rotter and Stein (1971) investigated
subjects' trust of a number of occupational groups,
using a variety of different populations. There
were no differences in the average trust assigned
to the various occupations as a function of the
subjects' educational attainment. Educationally,
the subjects ranged from high school graduates
through holders of a master's degree.
Wright and Shea (Note 3) examined the acceptance of personality interpretations in a study
in which all subjects were given the same stereotyped, positive, high-base-rate statements as feedback a week after taking two personality questionnaires that were not relevant to the actual statements made about them. The students rated the
accuracy of the statements. As in our other
studies, the Interpersonal Trust Scale had been

administered earlier in the semester, along with the
Internal-External Locus of Control Scale. Here
again, high trusters and low trusters did not differ
in their degree of acceptance of these stereotyped
personality analyses, but internal subjects accepted
these interpretations significantly less than did external subjects, indicating again that the criterion
was reliable and meaningful.
Rotter and Zuroff (Note 4) asked subjects to
determine the guilt or innocence of a defendant by
reading a typescript of a courtroom scene. The
conditions that were varied were the flamboyance
and sex of the defendant. There were a number
of interactions involving sex of subjects, sex of
defendant, style, and, trust. However, most of
the subjects saw the defendant as guilty, and high
trusters did not differ from low trusters in the
percentage who regarded the defendant as guilty.
Since the overwhelming majority of the subjects
regarded the defendant's explanations as weak and
illogical, this research has some relevance to a
discussion of gullibility. High trusters were not
any more likely to be taken in than low trusters.
Finally, Lajoy (1975) investigated the effects of
arrogance and expertise on subjects' trust of physicians and automobile mechanics. Lajoy used eight
videotapes. In the first, a professional actor portrayed a physician giving a diagnosis to a patient
and answering his questions arrogantly. In the
second, the same actor gave the same diagnosis
and advice, but nonarrogantly, and in the third
and fourth tapes, the same actor, designated as
a physician, gave advice to an acquaintance on a
zoning referendum (a topic presumably outside
his area of expertise), arrogantly and nonarrogantly. The other four videotapes, in which the
actor portrayed an automobile mechanic, paralleled
the first set in the way arrogance and expertise were varied. Different groups of subjects
observed each tape, and all the subjects had been
tested with the Interpersonal Trust Scale some
months earlier. In addition to ratings of the trustworthiness of the central character, ratings were
also made of his competence, his altruism, and
whether or not the subject would take the advice
given if he or she were the other person portrayed
in the videotape.
Although it is not central to the purposes of
this article, let me say that arrogance lowered the
ratings of trustworthiness of both physicians and
mechanics, and this effect was even stronger when
the physician was not speaking in an area of his
AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST • JANUARY 1980 • 5

<-----Page 5----->expertise. It is interesting that the ratings of competence did not suffer as much, but that is of little
consequence because the subjects indicated they
would be less likely to follow the advice of the
more arrogant person.
In this study high and low trusters did not
differ overall on their ratings of the trustworthiness
of the main characters of the tape. However,
there was a strong interaction as a function of
trust of subject and arrogance of character. High
trusters gave significantly lower ratings on trustworthiness to arrogant speakers than they did to
nonarrpgant speakers. Low trusters did not significantly differentiate the arrogant from the nonarrogant speaker, although both high trusters and
low trusters tended to rate the arrogant spea'ker,
as less trustworthy. Although these results do
not apparently have any direct bearing on the
gullibility of high trusters, they do indicate that
high trusters are differentiating whom to trust
and whom not to trust on the basis of specific
cues. We have no evidence that they differentiate
any better or worse than do low trusters, but these
results suggest that high trusters and low trusters
may be using different cues in making their
decisions.
To summarize the research regarding the gullibility of high and low trusters, it can be said,
most conservatively, that we have failed to establish that high trusters are any more likely to be
fooled than are low trusters. This conclusion
seems warranted, since we have examined the issue
in a wide variety of studies involving many different kinds of criteria, and the criteria themselves
were reliable and could be significantly related
logically to variables other than the level of generalized trust of the subject. It seems that high
trusters can read the cues as well or as poorly as
low trusters. They differ, however, in their willingness to trust the stranger where there are no
clear-cut data. The high truster says to himself
or herself, I will trust the person until I have
clear evidence that he Or she can't be trusted.
The low truster says, I will not trust the person
until there is clear evidence that he or she can be
trusted. Whether what we have called high trust
is a difference in the expectancy of risk or in the
importance to the subject for acting trusting and
verbalizing trust, or both, still needs to be determined.
Before attempting to draw conclusions from
these studies, it should be noted that none of
6 • JANUARY 1980 • AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST

them dealt with deprived populations or groups
that are subject to strong prejudice. We simply
do not know whether or not these findings would
hold in such populations. The notion of risk, or
in. social learning theory terms, the reinforcement
value of the consequences of trust, has not been
systematically considered in these studies. Deutsch
(1960) regarded risk as an important aspect of
his definition of trusting behavior. Several of the
studies reported here do involve a low level of
risk, such as the game situations and the apparatus
that might deliver a strong shock, and others perhaps involve moderate risk, for example, the investigations of cheating and shoplifting. However, the data are insufficient to generalize our results easily to conditions of very high risk.

Summary and Conclusion
It is not difficult to summarize these studies, keeping in mind the limitations previously mentioned.
The results are not surprising- they may not go
much beyond common sense, but neither are they
trivial.
First, a strong statement can be made about
the consequences to the society of people being
more trusting. People who trust more are less
likely to lie and are possibly less likely to cheat
or steal. They are more likely to give others a
second chance and to respect the rights of others.
Second, the personal consequences for the high
truster also seem beneficial. The high truster is
less likely to be unhappy, conflicted, or maladjusted; he or she is liked more and is sought out
as a friend more often, both by low-trusting and
by high-trusting others.
Third, the high truster is no less capable of
determining who should be trusted and who should
not be trusted, although in novel situations he or
she may be more likely to trust others than is
the low truster. It may be true that the high
truster is fooled more often by crooks, but the low
truster is probably fooled equally often by distrusting honest people, thereby forfeiting the benefits that trusting others might bring.
Finally, what does this mean for us as teachers,
parents, educators, psychologists? We cannot
control the forces at work in society by ourselves,
but within our own smaller circles of influence, we
can model and encourage a little more trust. The
consequences can be beneficial, the risks do not
seem to be too great, and a younger generation
may be a little more ready for a better world—
just in case there is one coming.
