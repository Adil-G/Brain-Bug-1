This article disc usses how the performance of famil y firms and nonfamily firms might differ
as a result of the different priorities flowing from family Influence, even when the two types
of firm s possess comparable levels of resou rce stocks. Using hierarchical regression to
analyze data from a national study of the Small Business Development Center program, we
find that family influence has both a positive and a negatlve moderating effect on the
relationships between diffe rent categories of resource stocks and performance. Specifically,
family firm s benefit more from reso urce stocks based on external relationships while
nonfamil y firms benefit more from reso urce stocks based on functional skltls .

Introduction
Recent eviden ce suggests that family firms outperform nonfami ly fi nns (e.g.. Anderson & Reeb, 2003; McConaughy, Matthew s, & Fialko, 200 1; Miller & Le Breton-M iller.
2005); however, the exact mec han isms and processes that lead to these performance
differences remain to be studied in detail. T hus, there is a growing recognition that a better
understandi ng of how family involvement infl uences performance is essential for progress
in the fi eld of family business (Habbershon, Williams, & MacM illan. 2003).
Of the theoretical frameworks available to ex plain the d ifferences between the perfonnan ce of family and no nfamil y firms, the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm as
co nceptualized by Die rickx and Cool (1 989), Barney (1991), and ot hers hold particular
prom ise (Chrisman, Chua, & Sharma, 2005; Habbershon & Williams, 1999; Habbershon
et al. , 2003). RBV pred icts that a finn ' s perfor mance will be affected not only by the level
and nature of its resource stocks but also by how the resources are de ployed and explo ited.
Based on this, researchers (e.g., Arregle, Hitt. Sirtnon, & Very, 2007 ; Sharma & Man ikutty, 2005 ; Sirmon & Hilt, 2003) have conce ptualized how famil y involvement may
produce differences between family and nonfamily fi rms in terms of the level and nature

studies have provided empirical evi de nce about these di fferences and how they imp act
performance.
To add ress this gap in the literature. we utilize Miller and Le Breton-Mi ller' s (2005.
2006) 4-C fram ework to develop hypotheses about how the priorit ies o f family fi rms lead
to d ifferences in the configuration of resource stocks that affect their perform ance vis-isvis nonfami ly firms. We use data extracted from a su rvey conducted by the Small Business
Developmen t Center (SBDC) program in the United States in 2002 to test the hypotheses.
Our study contributes to the fami ly busin ess literature by providing a theory-based
res ponse to a call for investigat ions about how diffe rences between fami ly and no nfam ily
fi rms affect their relative performance (e.g.. C hrisman er nl.. 2005: Shar ma. Chrisma n. &
C hua. 1997). We contribute to the development of a theory of the family firm by conceptualiz ing and testing how famil y fi rm priorit ies affect the relationship between resou rce
stoc ks and firm performance.
In the remainder of this article. we review the literature and discuss its application to
famil y businesses. Th en we deve lop ou r model and hypotheses. Fo llowing that. we present
o ur research methodology and results. In the fi nal sec tion. we d iscuss our findi ngs and
their implica tions for theory and future research.

Priorities and Resource Stocks
That family firms may embrace d ifferen t priorities is we ll accepted by researchers
(Gcrsick. Davis. Hampton. & Lansberg. 1997: Shar ma et al.. 1997). Priorities are important because they affect the types and levels o f investme nts a fam il y fi nn makes in
developi ng and acquiring resources over ti me. In tum . these "resource flows" from the
investmen ts made will lead to the acc umulation of "resource stoc ks" (Dierickx & Cool.
1989 : Ke llerman ns. 2003: Kellermanns & Floyd. 2005) that a finn can deploy stnuegically. Resource stoc ks incl ude both tangi ble assets such as fac ilities. eq uipment. and
money. as we ll as intangi ble assets such as reputation. social networks. intellectual
propeny. and the skills and knowled ge of employees and managers. These influence a
firm' s ability to achieve competitive parity. deve lop a temporary co mpetitive ad van tage .
or acq uire a sustainable competitive advantage. depend ing on the exten t to which the
resource stoc ks are valuable, rure, inimitable. and nonsubstitutable ( Barney. 199 1).
Recen tly. a co mpact framework- the 4·C model- was proposed by Mill er and Le
Breton-M iller (2005) as a way (0 characterize high ly successful family fi rms in terms of
{heir priorities. Th e fou r priorities are: ( I) continuity. the firm's pursuance of long-term
objec tives: (2) command. the freedom and ability to make ada ptive decisions: (3) connection . the fi rm ' s relationship with outside partn ers: and (4) co mmunity. th e priority
g ive n to buildin g a group of co mmitted and motivated peo ple (Miller & Le Breton-M iller.
p. 34). Althou gh Miller and Le Breton-Miller discuss these concept's separately. it is clear
that they do not consider them to be indepe nden t. Indeed , those au thors argue that it is the
combi nation of the four priorities thatmake so me fami ly businesses great.
Prio rities conce rning co ntinuity. command . comm unity, and connectio n are not exclusi ve to family fi rms: but the priorities of fam ily fi rms may be different from those of
nonfami ly fi rms in intensi ty, natu re. and the manner in which they are applied because
family involvemen t endows famil y firms with d ifferen t characteristic attributes and leads
to the pursuit of different goals (C hrisman er al.. 2005: Klein. Astrachan . & Smyrnios.
2005: M iller & Le Breton-M iller. 2005 ). The un ique au n butes. goals. and resu lting
priori ties o f family fi rms ca n produce the following important consequences.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->First, if the pri orities of family and nonfamily firm s d iffer, the resulting resource
stocks accumulated from investments made according to these priori ties sho uld also be of
a d ifferent type, eve n if not of a d ifferent category (e.g., a paternalistic rather than a
professional relationship between owners. manage rs. and employees). Second, owing to
path dependencies and interconnected ness in the development and accumu lation of
resou rces (Barney. 1991; Dierickx & Cool , 1989), it will be d iffi cult for non family fi rms
to duplicate the resou rce stocks of family fi rms (e.g., switching from a performanceoriented cultu re based on professional relationships to a people-oriented culture based on
paternalistic relationshi ps). Th ird, because family firms have d ifferent priorities based on
d ifferent goal s. they are also li kely to diverge from nonfamily fi rms in the manne r in which
they utilize their resource stocks (e.g., using paternalism to build long-term employee
com mitment and stewardship rather than professional performance-based criteria to
red uce opport unism). Finally, diffe rences in the types and application of resource stoc ks
between family and nonfam ily firms could lead 10 variatio ns in the ir relative performance.
In summary, even if family and nc nfamil y fi rms invest in resources that are generically similar, they may make their investme nts in different ways, in different amoun ts. and
for different purposes (Miller & Le Breton-Mil ler, 2005). When they do so, family and
nonfamily firms may exhibit substa ntial performa nce variations even tho ugh the reso urce
stocks they possess may be similar in both category and amount.

Hypothesis Development and Model
In this section. we first discuss what the literature ind icates are the typical relatio nships between particular categories of resource stocks and performan ce. We then extend
the literature by developing hypotheses about the moderating infl uence of famil y fi rm
priorities in terms of continuity, command, connection. and community. The model and
hypo theses are intended to explain why fami ly firm s, with similar levels of resource stocks
of a particular category will achieve higher performance than nonfamily firm s. ' The
hypotheses are consistent wi th Carney' s (2005) discussion o f perso nali sm and particu larism as so urces of family fi rms' competitive advantages and Le Breton-Mille r and Miller' s
(2006) emphasis on continuity and co mmand priorities. Fina lly. we present ou r model to
summarize our arguments and hypotheses.
We focus on three broad categories of resource stoc ks that firms accumulate based on
their prio ri ties of continuity. command. connection, and community. The first is external
relationships. defined as resou rce stoc ks e mbedded in the soc ial capital a finn secures over
time through its dealings with constituencies outside the organization. We measure these
in terms of supplier relations, loyal customers. banking relationships, and reputat ion.
Sec ond, internal relationships are de fi ned as resource stocks developed by investing in
rela tionshi ps with intra-organizational stakeholde rs. In this study. these include committed managers. owner-manage r trust, dedicated employees. and an active board o f
directors/advi sors. Finally. junctional skills repre sent the category of resource stocks
d irectly concerned wi th the design. production. and sale of prod ucts and services. Efficient

I. Unfortunately. in this study we nrc only able to test the implications of our assertions reg ardi ng priorities
rather than the asse rtions themse lves . We test the impli cations by investigati ng the moderating effec t of family
infl uence On the relationship between resou rce stocks and performance . Although our inability to directl y test
assert ions regardi ng the influence of priorities is a limitati on that future research needs to address. ou r
investi gation o r the im plicat ions of our theoretical model does suggest that such tests are likely to be
wo rthwhile.

<-----Page 3----->operations, marketing. innovations. and the products and/or services offered represent
functio nal resou rce stocks in this study.
Although we recognize that the generic and speci fic categories o f resources we study
are only a partial list of all possible reso urces. they do appear to be representative of both
the primary resources discussed in the literature (Chrisman. Bauerschmidr. & Hofer.
1998) and the ones family firms are particu larly suited to deploy (Carney. 2005: Habbersho n & Williams. 1999: Sirmo n & Hill. 2003). As suggested in the literature and described
below. we expect resource srocks and firm perfonnance 10 be positively related (Barric k
& Mount 199 1: Chandler & Hanks. 1994).
External resource stocks are import ant. Organizations must know who controls cri tical resou rces and how to interact with those external stakeholders in order to maxim ize
tra nsactio n effic iency and e ffectiveness. External relationships between an organization
and its suppliers. customers. and other constituencies ca n also be thought of as a functio n
of the strength of its social networks. which are needed to gain legitimacy and access to
reso urces (G ranovener. 1985). Many studies suggest that stro ng external social networks
are positively related to perfor mance (e .g.• Karra . Tracey, & Phill ips. 2006: McE vily &
Zaheer. 1999).
Internal resource stocks in the form o f strong re lationships among internal stakeholders can fac ilitate communication. intra-firm learning, and entrepreneurial behavior (Ad ler
& Kwon . 2002: Sirmon & Hi u. 2003). Relationships that result in internal social capital
will in tum positive ly influence the creation of human capital (Co leman. 1988), and as
soc ial capital is based on trust. the risk of opportunistic behavior wil l be reduced (Bradacb
& Everett. 1989). For exa mple, researc h on fa mi ly fi rms sugges ts that not only ca n good
relationships betw ee n fami ly owners and family managers improve performance
(Eddlesto n & Kellerrnanns. 2(07). bur also good re lationships between family managers
and employees can foster initiative and commitment (Miller & Lc Breton-Miller. 2(05).
Functional skills are fundamental to fi nn performa nce. Not su rprising ly. a positive
relat ionship between a finn ' s performance and its functional resource stocks has bee n
frequently discussed and demonstrated in the literature (e.g.. Porter. 1985: Roberts. 1999).

Hypotheses on the Mode rating Influence of Family Firm Priorities
Prio r li terature argues that fam ily fi nns and nonfami ly finn s are inherently di ffe rent
(Chrisman cr al.. 2005). Fo r examp le. accord ing to Miller and Le Breton-Miller (2005).
fami ly fi rms are likely [Q place a higher priority on continuity than nontamily fi rms. an
interpretation that is in line with other stud ies that stress both the long time hori zo n of
famil y fi r ms (Donnelley, 1964 ; Hnbbershon & Williams. 1999) and their desire fo r
cross-generational sustainability and management succession (Chua. Chrisman, &
Sharma. 1999). In addition, Miller and Le Breton-Miller suggest that connections with
external stakeholders are given higher priori ty in fami ly firms owing both to their desire
for continuity (Le Breton-Mi ller & Miller. 2006) and their intimate identifi catio n with the
business. As such. it is reasonable to argue that the priorities in fam il y fi rms will cause
family influence to moderate the relationship between resource stocks and performance .
owing to di ffe rences in the nature of the resource stocks acc umulated and how those
stocks are utilized.
In terms of external relationshi ps. the continuity priori ty sugges ts that family firms are
more likely to establish long-term external relationships. For exampl e. the dependencies
fostered by family ties and the imperative of transgenerationa l sustainability may permit
unique opportunities to tra nsfe r external social capital from one fami ly manager to another
(Steier, 2001 a. 200 lb). Th us. due to their continuity prio rity and ability. combined with

742

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->their priorities in establishing connections, fami ly firms appear more like ly to establi sh
long-term stable re lationships that depend upon collabo ratio n than nonfamily fi rms
(Carney, 2(05).
Nonfamily fi rms, on the other hand, owing to their narrower and shorter-term foc us on
revenues and costs, are li kely to es tablish external re lationships that are more formal,
co mpe titive, and transitory in nature. Research from the agency literature ind icates that
eve n short-term perform ance ca n suffer if re lationships are purely market-oriented. Th is
would be es pecially true for sm aller firms (such as the ones we are studying) that may
suffer fro m a lack o f market power vis-a-vis their exchange partners.
Family ow ners and man agers are, almost by definition, in terested in transgenerational
sustainability (Chua et at.. 1999). They identify with the business. which may use the
family name, tend to be embedded in a g iven community, and are mo re likely to be
co ncerned with and succeed in developing strong social networks based on trust (Bopaia h,
1998; Granovetter. 1985; Sirmon & Hitt, 2003; Steier, 200 1a, 200 Ib). Inter-organizational
trust may make it less cos tly to maintain networks of relationshi ps. In fact , family firms
are normally highly regarded for the way they man age external relationships with stakeholders (Bopaiah: Cabrera-Suarez, Sea-Perez. & Almeida, 200 1: Gudm undson, Tower, &
Hartman, 2003: Lyman . 1991 ). Put differently, the command and continuity priorities of
fam ily fi rms provide a credible signal to exchange partners that the connectio ns established will be mutually beneficial. This would again crea te a difference in the nature of
family fi rms' external resources.
In terms of uti li zation, the command priority. accruing as a con sequence of the desire
to keep control o f firm decisions within the family, should provide family managers in
family fi rms with greater auth ori ty and discretion in terms o f selecting. fashi on ing, and
util izing the ir soc ial networks in order to minimize costs, obtain information, and exploit
opportunities (Carney, 2(05). For example, greater fl exib ility in transaction governance
suggests that when change is necessary or whe n new external re lationshi ps are contemplate d. fam ily firms will be freer to choose between market-based contracts o r strategic
alliances with suppliers in attempts to lower costs or increase quality (Carney).
In summary. we argue that compared to nonfamily fi r ms. the confluence of continuity,
co mmand, and connec tion priorities of fam ily firms cause them to develop different kinds
o f relation ships with external stakeho lders and utilize these relationships di fferently.
Th ese d ifferences should have a positive moderating influence on the re lationship between
external resource stocks and performa nce.
Hypothesis I : As a result of the moderating infl uence o f family priorities, the
relation ship between externa l resource stocks and performance will be stronger for
fam ily firms than nonfamily firms.
Resource stocks related to internal relationships are also likely to take on a somewhat
different configuration and are li kely to be leveraged differently in family firms owi ng
primarily to their continuity. command, and community priorities. Managers of fami ly
firm s with residual cl aims to ownership should have a greater interest in transgenerarional
sustainability, longer investment hori zons, and more discretio n to ac t on those interests than
managers in nonfami ly fi rms. Accord ingly, family fi rms have bot h the motivation and the
latitude to create internal relationships based on trust and a sense of comm uni ty. since
higher levels of internal social capital facilitate the tran sition of the family fi rm across
generations (Sirmon & Hitt, 2(03) and positively affects family fi rm performance (Arregle
et al., 2007 ; Pearson , Carr, & Shaw, 2008). ln fact, family members tend to be more
committed and loyal to the orga nization and have higher career satisfaction than people
working in nonfamily fi rms (Beehr, Drexler, & Fau lkner. 1997). Furthermore. the resid ual

<-----Page 5----->claims 10 ow nership of family members and the potential for reciproc al altruis m suggest
that eve n though family firms ma y have nonzero agen cy cos ts whe n altruism is asy mme tric
(Schulze, Lubatki n. Dino. & Buch holtz. 200 1). the re lationships amo ng family mem be rs in
a business ca n result in lower agency costs fo r family firms (C hrisman. C hua, & Litz. 2(04).
This is not to say that fami ly firms are not faced with di ffic ulties ma nag ing internal
relationships with family and non family mem bers. Indeed. command priorities can result
in dysfuncti onal confl icts that can red uce fami ly com mitment and trust ( Kellerm anns &
Eddles ton. 20(4) with concomitant effec ts on performance. Furthe rmore. justice perceptions of nonfamily mem be rs working in a fami ly firm arc also sensitive to the man ner in
which command priorities shape the rela tions hips wit h a firm' s internal stakeholder
community (Barnett & Kellerman ns. 2006). However. if both j us tice perceptions and
conflicts are ma naged we ll. pe rformance should be posi tive ly a ffected (Barnett & Kellermanns: Eddleston & Kellermanns. 2007).
Famil y firms are able to leverage their inte rnal resources differently from nonfamily
firms more because the relationships be tween employees and fam ily ow ners and managers
can be used to create no neco nomic value for both groups. Th is is possible pa rtly because
fam ily firms are more likely to have both economic and nonecon omic goals than non famil y firms. Forexample. fam ily fi rms may provide non pecun iary bene fi ts not avail able in
nonFamily firms to nonfamily members wor king in fami ly fi rms (e.g.. Beeh r et al.. 1997).
Research suggests that famil y fi rms arc, in gene ral. more likel y to develop o rgani zations based o n trust and a sense o f community (Jo nes. Johnson. Butler, & Main. 1983:
Ward & Handy. 1988). Su ch trust and sense of community s hould also mak e fam ily firms
more able to utilize fami ly resources in ve nturing efforts ( Rogoff & Heck. 2003) and
enha nce g rowth. In addition. a motivated. loyal wo rkforce combined with man agerial
commit ment to the goals o f the finn should reduce moni toring costs (Steier. 200 la.
200lb). cnabling whatever resou rces are available to be utili zed more effectively.
In s ummary, we posit that. owi ng to the fami ly fi rm ' s con tinuity. command . and
communi ty priori ties. internal relations hips in fami ly firms will be based more on trust
and a sense o f commu nity than those in non family fi rms. which arc more likel y to be
based on professional standa rds. Family fi rms will also di ffer from no nfami ly fi rms in how
they leverage these relationships through the use of noneconomic incentives and the
enha nced ability to utilize firm resources in venturing efforts . These differences should
boost the contributions of inte rna l reso urces to fi rm perfor mance in comparison to nonfamily firms with similar levels of intern al resources. T hus:
Hypothesis 2: As a result o f the moderating infl uence o f family priorities, the
re lati onshi p between internal resou rce stoc ks and pe rformance will be stronge r for
fami ly fir ms than nonfamily firms.
Functional resource stoc ks are likel y to be utilized d ifferently in fam il y firms tha n
nonfamily fi rms ow ing to di ffere nces in continuity and comm an d priorities (Mi ll er & Le
Breton- Miller. 2005). First. the continuity priority of family fi rms requires that fam ily
members retain, over time. a greate r stake in ownership and ma nagement than is the case
in nonfamily firms. Because family members are investing the ir own money, they will tend
to be more mindful of efficienc ies in the acq uisition and utilizatio n of assets (Carney.
2005). A study by McCo naughy et al. (200 1) indicates that large fami ly firms have more
efficient operations.
Second. the command prio rity of family fi r ms mean s fami ly fi nn leade rs have greater
authority and discret ion in how they use the fi rm' s fi nancial resources an d s hould therefore be more at liberty to innovate and otherwise alte r their resou rce stoc ks than nonfamily
firms (Carney. 2005). This suggests that family firms are able to act more aggressi vely

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->when entering new markets or developing new resource stocks (Carney ; Miller & Le
Breton-Miller. 2005). Family firms' command and continuity priorities al so suggest that
they wi ll be more consistent in investi ng to develop functional skills over time (Le
Breton-Miller & Mi ller. 2006).
On the other hand. these command and continu ity priorities could make fam ily fi rms
more reluctant to divest outdated resource stocks in a timely manner than nonfamil y fi rms
(Sharma & Manikutty. 2005). As a result . aside from utili zat ion, the nature of the
functional resource stocks developed by fa mily fi rms may be markedl y different from
those deve loped by nonfamil y fi rms where resource investment s are influenced by procedure and short-term shareholder wealth maximizati on (cf. Gerlach. 1992).
To summarize. we argue that differences in command and continuity priori ties will
make family firms more mindful of efficiencies in the acquisition and utilization of
fu nctional skills. more aggressive in developing fu nctional resource stocks, more consistent in the development of these resou rce stocks over time. and more aggressive in
entering new markets. Furthermore, the fu nctional resource stocks developed by family
firms may differ from those developed by nonfamily firm s. As a result, family firms should
have an advantage over nonfam ily fi rms in leveraging the fun ctional resource stocks that
are available. Accordingly. we hypothesize:
Hypot hesis 3: As a result of the moderating influence of famil y priorities. the
relationshi p between functional resource stocks and performance will be stronger fo r
family firms than ncnfamil y firm s.

Model
The hypotheses and arguments made above are summarized in the research model

<-----Page 7----->Methodology
This study utilizes data from a larger project pertaining to the SBDC program in the
United States." In the spri ng and summer of 2002. question naires were sent to the entire
popu lation of 28,996 SBOC clients who operated an estab lished business and received
fi ve or more hours of counseling assistance from these SBOCs in 2000. The main purpose
of the survey was to assess the performance of the SBDC' s clients 1 year after they
received assistance. For the purpose of this study. the SBDe permitted us to add a li mited
number of questions to differentiate fa mily and nonfumily businesses as well as the
resource stock levels of the partic ipating firms.
Two mailings of the questionnaire were conducted to increase the response rates and
to permit more comprehensive testi ng of the representativeness of the respondents. A total
of 5.55 1 existing business clients responded. resulting in a response rate of 19.1 %.
However, we used only those responding firm s wit h between 10 and 100 employees to
ensure comparability between the firm s studied and to exclude very small or single-person
firm s that are likely to rely more on individual abilities than on the development of
organizational resource stocks. Due to the size restriction and missing data, our fi nal
sample size totaled 505 fi rms. The small proportion of fi rms of reasonable size in our
database is a common problem in studies using SBDC data (c.g.. Chri sman et al., 2004)
and indeed in studies of fami ly fi rms in general, most of which rely on convenience
sampli ng from organization or client li sts (e.g.. Schulze er aI. , 200 1).
In order to test for potenti al nc nresponse bi ases, respondents were div ided into early
and late respondents, depending on the time the questionnaire was returned. There were
no statistically significant differences between the fi rst and second mailing in rerm s of our
dependent or independent variables or size. Since late respondents could be expected to be
more similar to nonrespondents (Kanuk & Berenson. 1975; Oppenheim, 1966), these tests
suggest that there is no reason to suspect bias along any of the key variables analyzed in
this study in com parison to the population of SBDC clients (cf. Hawes & Crittenden.
1984).

Ind epend ent Var iables
Resource Stocks. Based on Miller and Le Bre ton-Miller (2005). we attempted to capture
potentia l resource stocks that were likely 10 be influ enced by the aforementio ned priorities
of family fi rms. Since our study encompassed both fa mil y and nonfamily firm s. we
attempted to measure resource stocks that would be relevant to both types of fi rms. In order
to measure the fi rms' resource Slack levels. respondents were asked to "rate the extent you
believe your fi rm has a competitive advantage or disadvantage in the following areas'' on a
Scpoiru Likert scale. where scores of " 1" indicated a large di sadvantage and scores of "5"
indicated a large advantage. We summed the item ratings of dedicated employees. committed man agers. owner- manager trust. and active board of directors/advisors 10 measure
internal relationship resource stocks. External relationship resource stocks were measured
by the sum of the ratings for supplier relations, loyal customers. reputation. and banking
relationships. Functional skill resource stocks were measured by the Slim of the ratings for
efficient operations, marketing, developing innovat ions. and products and/or services. As

<-----Page 8----->shown in the Appendix . Cronbach's alpha coeff icier us equaled .77 for internal resource
stocks..68 for external resource stocks. and .77 for fun ctional resource stocks. A confi rmatory factor analysis supported our three-factor structure. The three-factor solution
showed good fi t (e.g.. CFI =.915. GFI =.935), thus mitigating potential validi ty concerns
(Hu & Bentler. 1995: Kline. 1998; Mulaik et al.. 1989).

Family Infl uence. Our hypotheses are based on expected moderating influence of the
continuity. command. connection, and community priori ties of fami ly and nonfa mily
fi rms. Since we do not have direct measures of the 4 C's, the infl uence of the differences
in priorities that occur because of the involvement of a family in a finn is measured by a
single categorical variable called family influence thai indicates whether the finn is a
famil y firm .
To differentiate the two types of fi rms. we follow Chua et al. (1999. p. 25 ) by defi ning
a fami ly fi nn as "a business governed and/or managed with the intention to shape and
pursue the vision of the business held by a dominant coalition controlled by members of
the same family or a small number of families in a manner that is potentially sustainable
across generations of the fami ly or families: ' Abiding by the way this has been operationalized in prior studies (e.g., Chrisman er at.. 20(4). we measured the ( I) percentage of
the business owned by family members. (2) number of fam ily managers. and (3) expectation that the future successor as president of the business will be a family member. The
fi rst two measures were cardinal numbers while the third variable was measured by a
categorical yes- no response.
Various researchers (e.g., Klein et al., 2(05) suggest that fam ily influence should be
measured as a continuous variable rather than a categorical variable. For our purpose here,

management. and succession intention. Us ing the three components in the analysis would
measure the indi vidual infl uences of the components and not capture the combined
moderating effect of fami ly influence: by contrast separating the sample firms into two
dichotomous groups based on the three components would do so directly. Thus. in keeping
with the theoretical definition proposed by Chua er at. (1999), our measure emphasizes
distinctions between fa mily and nonfamily fi rms in general rather than simply the
amounts of attributes different fi rms possess. Furthermore. this approach is consistent
wi th the majority of the comparative studies conducted to date (cf. Chrisman er al.. 2005;
Sharma et al.. 1997).
To disti nguish family and nonfami ly firms. we followed Chrisman et al. (2004) and
used the quick cluster program in SPSS. Two clusters were obtained. The IWO groups
diITer significantly on all dimensions with fami Iy firms having much higher proportions of
famil y ownership. twice as many family managers. and a substantiall y greater desire for
succession (see Table I). Famil y fi rms were coded as ''1'' (n = 385) and nonfami ly fi rms
as "0" (n = 120). The proportion of fa mily fi rms in the sample is similar to other studies
(Chrisman et al.).'

Depend ent Va riable
Sales growth between the ca lendar years of 2000 and 200 I served as the dependent
variable. Sa les growth has been used as a dependent variable in other studies o f family
(e.g.. Schulze et al.. 2001 ) and nonfarn ily businesses (e.g.. Collins & Sm ith. 2006) and
has the advantage of bei ng more reliable (He & Wong. 2004) and free from distortion
through rent appropriation by a finn ' s stakeholders (Coff. 1999). Prior research has
called for fu rther studies using sales growth as an ou tcome variab le (e.g.. Hart &
Banbury. 1994).
We would have preferred a grow th measure that encompassed a longe r period of time
and co nsider the short-ter m measure to be the principal limitation of our study. Unfortunarcly. we were constrained by the SBDC s research requireme nts. which precl uded
add itional questio ns beyond those used to measure our independent variables. In spite of
this limitation. however. we were able to obta in some interesting fi nding s that wi ll
hopefully inspire addi tional research in the subject area. Furthermore. the fact thai most of
the firms in o ur sample were relatively matu re . and therefore less prone to wide swings
in sales growth from year 10 year partia lly mitigates the li mitations of o ur sho rt-term
measure.
Since snles revenues for the two calendar years exhibited positive skewness . we used
logarithms to minimize the skewness. Thus. the sales grow th variable was measured by the
d ifference in the logarithm of total sales revenue in 200 1 and 2000: this is arithmeticall y
equivalent to the logarithm o f the ratio of 200 I calendar year sales to 2000 calendar year
sales.

Control Variables
Prior research suggests that firm resources may vary across differe nt geog raphic
regions (Chrisman. 1999). Thus. we create du mm y variables for the four regio ns of the
United States (North/Midwest, South, East. and West) based on a cod ing scheme used by
Chrisma n. To avoid over-specifying the regression equation, three of the region s were
used in the analysis.
We also included proxies for industry in our analysis. Previous research has shown
that experiences are often shared among industry participants and that such experiences
forge common perceptions (Huff. 1982). In addition. the industry might have a d irect
effect on our dependent variable. especially considering that the period 200<>-200 1

<-----Page 10----->involved an econom ic slowdown that would have affected various industri es differently.
Two du mmy vari ables were used to measure ind ustry. The first designated firm s in
retail. service, or wholesale indu stries: 44.7% of family fi rms and 35.8% of nonfarnily
firms competed in these industries. The second designated manufa cturing fi rms. This
included 28 .3% of the famil y firms and 30.0% of the non fami ly firms. The remaining
firms (27,0% o f fami ly firms and 34.2% of nonfam ily fi rms) co mpeted in other
indu stries.
Since size can affect performance (e.g., Cockbu rn. Henderson, & Stem, 2000), we
used the number o f employees as a control variable. Mean size was 24.2 employees
(standard deviation [SOJ = 17.1 ). For family fi rms, mean size was 23.6 e mployees
(S O = 16.5) and for non fami ly firm s, the mean was 26.0 employees (SO = 18.8). We used
the logarithm of employees to minimize skewness.
Finally. we control for age to rule out the effects of the liability of newness (Stichco mbe, 1965) as well as the ri giditi es that might develop as a venture ages. both o f which
mi ght negatively affect performance (Durand & Coeurderoy, 200 I). The organizations in
ou r study ranged in age from 3 to 163 years with a mean of 20,9 (S O = 23 .0). The mean
age for famil y firm s was 22,1 (S O = 22 .9) and was 17.2 for nonfarnily fi rms (SO = 22.8).
Again. the logarithm of the age variable was used to minim ize skewness.

Analysis
We tested our hypothesis using a hierarchical ordinary least sq uares mult iple regression model. Regression mode ls are recommended for analyzing moderation effects
(Agui nis. 2004: Cohen & Cohen. 1993). Since data were obta ined from a single survey,
we tested for common method variance (Podsakoff & Organ , (986), A method factor did
not e merge. Thus, we concluded that co mmon method variance is not a signific ant
probl em,
Since we observed co rrelatio n coeffi cients as high as .59, we checked the data for
multi -co llinearity. After standard izing the main effect variables, the conditio n index d id
not exhibit values higher than 19.55 and the variance inflation factor never exceeded
values of 7.79 for any given variable. Thus, we co ncluded that multi -collinearity is not a
concern.

Results
Variable means, SOs. and zero-order correlations are shown in Table 2 and the results
of the hierarchical regression analysis in Table 3. As shown in Table 3. Mod el I includes
only the control variable s. Mod el 2 adds the resource stock and family influence variables,
and Model 3 adds the interaction terms used to test our hypotheses. The regress ion models
are all signifi cant at the .00 1 leve l and the R 2 changes for Mod els 2 and 3 are signifi cant
at rheD I and ,as levels. respectively. O verall. the fu ll regression model explains a modest
amount of the variance in ou r dependent variable, sales growth (R2 = , 144. adjusted
R' = .1 19).
Model I shows that the only co ntrol variable with a signifi cant influence on sales
growth was age and thai re lationshi p was negative. In Model 2, the result s show that
functional resource stock levels have a signifi cant positive relationship with sales growth
(p < .01 ), The other two main effects were not signifi cant. Thus, sales growth was not
related to the leve ls of resource stocks based on external or intern al relationships.

Although OUf hypotheses are concerned only with the moderati ng influences of famil y
invo lveme nt. we incl uded the fami ly influence variable in this model for completeness
because family influence may directly affect performance (Anderson & Reeb. 2003;
McConaughy er aI., 2(0 1). However, the coeffi cient for the fami ly influence variable was
not signifi cant, ind icating that sales growth was not signifi cantly different for the family
and nonfamily finn s in our sample.
Hypothesis I argues that external resource stocks have a more positi ve performance
effect for family fi r ms. As shown in Model 3, that hypothesis was supported (p < .05).
However. Hypothesis 2 was not supported; there was no signifi cant interaction effect
between internal resource stocks and fam ily infl uence. Finally, the test for hypothesis 3
shows a signifi cant interaction between functional resource stoc ks and family infl uence
(p < .05). However. the relationship was negative. contrary to [he d irection expected.
These results are exam ined in more depth below.

Discussion and Conclusions
In this study, we argued that the configurations and deployment of resource stocks

tend to support these conten tions even tho ugh o ur hypotheses received only mixed

Th us. alth ough we observed no signific ant effects on sales growth from the interacti on

resource stocks. To in terpret the result s, the two interaction s are plotted in Figures 2 and

A.s discu ssed previously, regres sion Model 3 suggests that the interaction between
famil y influence and ex ternal resource stoc ks produces a net positive effect on short-term
performance. Figure 2 shows that the sales growth o f famil y firms increases only slightly
as their ex ternal resource stoc ks increased . while the sales growth of nonfami ly firms
decreases d rastically. Thi s suggests that the externa l connections of family fi rms are

FunctIonal Skill Reso urce Stocks

relationship displayed in Figure 2 is somewhat counterintuitive since we would have
expected positi ve slopes for the performance of both types of fi r ms, albeit Sleeper ones for
family firm s.
One interpretation of the gentle slope for the famil y firm line is that external relationships in family firms yield social capital but thi s social capital has a relatively modest
short-term impact. Another is that fami ly firm s have generally strong external relationships. and thu s. the difference between strong and very strong external relationships is
not considerable. On the other hand, the pattern di splayed fo r nonfamily fi rms-a steep
downward slope in performance as external resource stocks increase-suggests that the
external relationships established by nonfamily firm s affected their sales growth negatively and are dysfunctional in some way. The negative impact could be expla ined if strong
external relati onships increase the exposure of nonfamily firm s to opportunistic behavior
on the pan of suppliers. customers. or lenders. For example. if relationships are hand led
contractuall y. then stronger relationships may place relatively small nonfamily fi rms at a
disadvantage if their partners possess greater market power. Unfo rtunately. because we
were only able to measure the strength rather than the types of relationships famil y and
non famil y fi rms establish with external stakeholders. these are just conjectures that future
research will need to take up.
Our second significant interaction shows that functional resource stocks are positively
related to performance for both fami ly and non famil y firm s (Figure 3). However. whil e the
in itial benefits for famil y firms are higher. nonfarnily firms appear to obtain disproportionate benefits from iruprovernent s in fu nctio nal capabilities. This finding (along with the
Ma y, 2009

753

<-----Page 15----->fi nding pertaining to hypothesis I) supportS the idea that. exce pt perhaps in the face of
unusual opportunities. continuity and command priorit ies make family firms a more stable
organizational form. It also suggests thai nonfamily firm prioriti es may make them more
likely to be decentrali zed along functional lines, and consequently, better suited to ca pita lize 011 higher levels o f Functional resource stoc ks than Family firm s. atleast in the sho rt
term.

Contributions and Limitations
Our study contributes to the literature in the fo llowing ways. First, study ing resource
stocks in the context of fi rm priorit ies cont ributes to the RBV by showing that the
configuration and deployment of a part icular category of resource stocks may be as
important as the level or strength of the stocks possessed. As such, ou r study confi rms
recent research ind icati ng that the sheer abundance of resources may be secondary to the
leveraging o f the resou rce stoc k (Mishina. Pol loc k, & Porac. 2004). Second, we applied
Miller and Le Breton-Miller' s (2005) 4-C framework to help explain why the performance
of famil y and non famil y firm s di ffers, Finall y. showing by implication that the priorities
of family and nonfamily firm s differ materi ally, our study is among the first to demonstrate
empi rica lly that the influ ence of a family in a firm can lead to distinct ive resources
(Habbersbon & Williams. 1999: Habbershcn et al.. 2(03).
Our study also has several limitations. First. the sample is drawn from a crosssectio nal study. Th us, the causal inferences drawn here are based on theoretical considerations rather than empirical causality. Second. the amount of variance (adj usted R 2) in
sa les growth explained by the regression model was moderate. T his may be partly d ue to
the coarse nature of our measures. But because our objec tive was to show associations and
not to find predictive relation ships, and since our sample size pro vided suffi cien t degrees
of freedom for the observed effects. this should not be a serious concern. Furt hermo re.
although the interactio n terms only explained 1.4% of additional variance, the magnitude
o f the increase is worth laking seriously, Indeed. for practical and statistical purposes. 1%
is considered the threshold (Aguinis . 2004).
Third, the use o f S BDC data created additional limitations. For example. S BDC
clients may n OI be re presentative of all fi rms in the U.S. economy. In addition, the need to
fu lfi ll obligations to the S BDC program req uired trade-o ff's . such as our use of short-term
sa les growth as a performance measure. However, we believe that the use of sales growth
is j ustifi ed. Sustainable competitive advantages are less likely in smaller o rgan izati ons (cr.
Hart & Ban bury. 1994 ). In addition. sales growth has been round to be an exce llent
predictor of long-te rm pro fi tability (Henderson. 1999 ; Ti mmo ns. 1999). a more common
dependent variable in RBV
Fourth. sales growth was measured betw een the calendar years 2000 and 2001. In
200 1, a major external shock to the economy, the tragedy of 9/ 11. occurred. While this
catastrophe must have had a negative effect o n sales growth. we believe that the conclusions we have drawn are still valid; the external shoc k could onl y have affected fourth
qu arter growth and our industry controls would likely have accounted for variatio ns in the
effects o f this catastrophe.
Fifth, we again note that although a post hoc test d id not indicate common method
bias was a pro blem. obtaining so me variables fro m secondary so urces would have been
preferable .
Sixth, we were only able to infer rather than test the importance of the priorities
identifi ed by Miller and Le Breton-Mil ler (2005) because we did not have direct measures
of the priorities. In addition. we conce ntrated on the business side of the family-business

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->dyad . Future studies may bene fi t from more explicit attention to family issues as these
may directly and indirectl y affect priori ties. resou rce stocks, and fi rm performance (Olson
et al., 2003; Rogoff & Heck. 2003; Sharma. 2008: Stafford, Duncan, Danes. & Winter.

1999).

Implications, Future Research, and Conclusions
By providing evidence thnt differences in pri orities may alter the config uration and
deployment of resource stocks and that such differences might lead to performance
variations between famil y and nonfumily firms, our study provides an ample basis to
guide future research. Aside from overcoming the lirnitarions of this study, fu ture
research should attempt to open the black box. by further examini ng the differences in
the nature of the priori ties between family and nonfamily firms, how those pricrirics
affect the nature of resource stocks developed. and how strategies are fo rmulated around
those distinctive resource stocks. Doing so will lead to a bet ter understanding of how
famil y and nonfamily firms confi gure and leverage their resources (Sirmon & Hitt.
2003). Furthermore, given thet the priori ties and resource stoc ks of fami ly firms may be
a function of stage of development (Gersick er al., 1997), opport un istic impulses
(Morek & Yeung. 2(03). and goals (Chrisman, Chua, & Litz, 2003). research on how
famil y attributes influence the resources and performance of different types of family
fi rms is also needed.
Our results suggest that having more resources does not automatically lead to competitive advantages and/or superior performance (Baron. 199 1). As researchers observe.
some resources are simply necessary as a threshold just to operate an organization (Long
& Vickcrs-Kock, 1995). Future studies are therefore needed to identify what these threshold resource stocks are in both fami ly and ncnfarnily organizations. Fu rthermore. our
measurement of resource stocks included broad indicators that tried to capture a wide
range of resources in a particular category. Although the alpha levels for the constructs
used are acceptable, it is clear that the firms varied somewhat in the composition of their
resource stocks. Therefore, futu re research should try to develop more detai led measures
of the resource stocks that fami ly and nonfamil y fi rms accumulate.
In addi tion, the goals of family fi rms may be di fferent from those of nonfamily firms;
growth and wealth creation may not necessarily be the only goals of family firms (Lee &
Rogoff. 1996; Sharma et al.. 1997). Indeed. our conceptu alizat ion of the differences
between famil y and nonfarnily fi rms relies upon the assumption that divergent goals are
man ifested in diffe rent priorities. wh ich cause variations in the resource stocks ultimately
developed. Research needs to investigate more full y the extent to which resource stocks
are accumulated for other noneconomic purposes, and if and how th is spills over to affect
the economic performance of family fi rms. In additi on. fu ture research needs to lake into
account that not all fa mily fi rms are similar (Klein et al.. 2005; Sharma. 2003; Westheard
& Cowl ing. 1998). We operationalized fami ly infl uence as a dichotomous variable to
facil itate comparisons with nonfamily fi rms. However. we know full well that this is an
oversimplification. Our knowledge would increase if future research would take a more
fi ne-grained approach to classifying different types of family fi rms.
In conclusion. this study provides in it ial support for the argument that differences in
the continuity. command, connection, and community priori ties of family and nonfa rnily
firms affect the configuration and deployment of their resource stocks, and that the
result ing variations help explain the relative short-term performance of these two types of
organi zational forms. We hope that th is study wi IIstimulate others to take the investi gation
further.
