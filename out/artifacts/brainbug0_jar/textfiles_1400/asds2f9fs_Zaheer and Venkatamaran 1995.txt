We develop a model of relational governance as a specific form of inter organizational
strategy that is distinct from the traditional modes of markets and hierarchies. We
conceptualize this form of strategy in terms of structural and processual dimensions and
derive a model of its determinants through arguments drawn from transaction cost economics
and the sociological exchange literature. Hierarchical regression modeling is employed to
test the theoretical model on data collected from a sample of 329 independent insurance
agencies. We include the relational variahle of trust and demonstrate that the combined
model explains relational governance better than a model with the traditional determinants
of governance form alone. Further, we obser\-e that governance structure and process are
related and discuss implications of the dynamic link between them. Directions for extensions
are developed for strategic management research and practice.

A current research thrust in organizational
economics and strategic management is focused
on 'intermediate' modes of governance, distinct
from the traditional modes of market and
hierarchy (Williamson. 1975. 1991). Intermediate
modes of governance may serve as alternative
governance structures to vertical financial ownership (Mahoney. 1992; Ring and Van de Ven,
1992). These take several forms such as joint
ventures (Harrigan. 1985a; Kogut, 1988). strategic
partnerships between suppliers and buyers (Heide
and John, 1990), technology licensing (Koh and
Venkatraman, 1991) and alliances (James, 1985;

Lewis, 1990). Such governance modes have been
variously termed as hybrids (Williamson, 1991)
or networks (e.g.. Eccles and Crane, 1987), and
are not only widespread in the contemporary
business environment, but are increasing greatly
in number (Harrigan, 1988). Further, their
strategic importance is growing (Thorelli, 1986;
Powell, 1987, 1990); for example, networks are
said to enhance the competitive positioning of
firms (Jarillo, 1988). Research into intermediate
governance modes has significant implications
for strategie management as it explores critical
choices relating to the scope of the firm and to
firm boundaries.
This paper builds on transaction cost reasoning
(Williamson, 1975, 1985) and evaluates an emerging view that noneconomic factors, primarily

in order to distinguish them from more traditional
transaction cost determinants—are complementary to economic ones in the governance of
exchange relationships (Dore, 1983. 1987; Granovetter, 1985; Lazerson, 1988; Ring and Van de
Ven, 1992). In other words, we are interested in
understanding the determinants—both economic
and sociological—of relational governance
(Macneil, 1980; Williamson. 1985; Dwyer. Schurr,
and Oh, 1987). Further, the paper views relational
governance as embodied in both the structure
and the process of an interorganizational
relationship—specifically, one involving exchange.
Thus, we draw on research streams on transaction
cost economics and sociological exchange perspectives to develop a research model which is

1979).
More generally, our paper responds to Hill's
(1990) call for a greater research focus on the
nature and effects of the 'long-term cooperative
relationships' between economic actors. Further,
this work is in line with Hansen and Wernerfelt
(1989), who integrated economic and behavioralsociological factors to explain firm performance
and stressed the need for research attention to
multidisciplinary approaches in explaining firmlevel phenomena.
RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESES
Relational governance: A conceptualization

The transaction cost perspective argues that the
transaction costs of exchange are the most
significant determinants of the governance form.
Transaction costs are largely determined by the
extent to which the assets of the parties to the
relationship are specialized to the transaction
that occurs between them (Klein, Crawford, and
Alchian, 1978; Williamson, 1985). In order to
protect transaction-specific assets from opportunistic appropriation, firms will choose to internalize
the transaction or otherwise arrange to increase
the extent of hierarchical control over the other
party to the relationship.
While traditionally the choice of governance
has been cast in terms of the two polar extremes,

market or hierarchy (Coase. 1937; Williamson,
1975). this paper is focused on intermediate
governance modes—specifically on relational
governance. It builds on the assertion articulated
by Macneil (1978, 1980), Dore (1987), and
others, that contracting is never completely
discrete (i.e.. anonymous, characterized by limited
communication, as assumed by neoclassical
theories) but that even the most fundamental
model of discrete exchange includes some
relational elements.' Use of the term 'relational
governance' in this paper suggests interfirm
exchange which includes significant relationshipspecific assets, combined with a high level of
interorganizational trust. This is consistent with
Ring and Van de Ven (1992).
The relational nature of contracting owes its
origins to Macneil (1978, 1980). who views a
contract as reflecting 'the relations among parties
to the process of projecting exchange into the
future' (1980: 4). Central to Macneil's argument
is the proposition that relational exchange is
based on a social component, largely represented
by trust. Specifically, the parties involved in
relational exchange derive 'non-economic satisfactions and engage in social exchange as well as
. . . economic exchange' (Macneil, 1980: 13;
emphasis added). Further '. . . modem relations
. . . just like primitive relations, require solidarity
and hence a degree of trust, or faith in others,
to work successfully' (1980: 21; emphasis added).
This line of reasoning is consistent with the
work of sociologists such as Powell (1990) and
Granovetter (1985), who develop the notion of
emheddedness. Specifically, these scholars have
argued for recognizing the role played by socially
embedded personal relationships in economic
exchange. Economic exchange relations thus
depart from 'pure economic motives' and 'become
overlaid with social content that carries strong
expectations of trust and abstention from opportunism' (Granovetter, 1985: 490). The significant
social component in economic action is generally
ignored in economic explanations of exchange
activity, and is frequently consigned to the error
term or to 'noise' (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).
However, economists such as Arrow (1973: 24)
have also recognized that 'there is an element of
trust in every transaction'.
' As a reviewer rightly points out. nor is exchange ever
completely hierarchical, as long as exit is an optioa.

<-----Page 2----->Relational Governance
In a similar vein, Dore (1987) invokes examples
from the Japanese textile industry to argue
for the significance of sociological elements in
exchange. Specifically, he discusses the role that
continuity, mutual dependence, trust, and social
norms play in the maintenance of exchange
relationships between supplier and buyer firms.
He argues that similar considerations intervene
to a greater extent than is generally believed in
Western business contexts as well (see also
Macauley, 1963). Hill (1990) argues that contrary
to the classic transaction cost view that opportunism generally characterizes exchange, it is
relationships based on cooperation and trust that
are more likely to survive in the marketplace.
His rationale is that 'opportunism, the safeguards
needed to check opportunism, and internalization
as a response to opportunism dissipate the
composite quasi rent' (1990: 511). and actors
who do not cooperate and trust each other will
therefore tend to be less efficient than those who
do. Competitive pressures will tend to select out
inefficient relationships and firms that enter into
them, leaving behind the more efficient, trustbased ones. Thus, empirically, the assumption
that opportunism characterizes exchange should
be reconsidered in favor of one that suggests
that trust does.
Transaction cost theorists such as Williamson
(1985) have recognized the abundance of intermediate governance forms and suggest that,
under certain conditions, these 'relational' forms
are maintained by economic weapons such as
hostages and credible commitments to keep
opportunistic behavior at bay. However, this
view of relational governance is somewhat at
variance from that articulated by Macneil (1980)
and Dore (1987). who conceive of relational
exchange as supported by non-economic factors
such as trust. It is possible that over time,
relational forms evolve from using economic
safeguards to protect specific assets to employing
trust in this way (Ring and Van de Ven, 1992).
Dimensionalizing governance as structure and
process
We view relational governance as comprised of
two basic underlying dimensions: (a) the structure
of the relationship—conceptualized in terms of
the degree of vertical quasi-integration (Blois,
1972) reflecting the degree of market or hier-

375

archical structuring of the transaction; and (b)
the process underlying the relationship—conceptualized in terms of the degree of joint action
(Heide and John. 1990) in the exchange relationship. More broadly, the governance structure in
this discussion is viewed as the interunit or
interfirm framework within which exchange takes
place. The use of the term 'structure' here refers
to 'governance' structure, which we emphasize
is quite distinct from organizational structure.
The latter concept is most frequently used to
describe the administrative relationships within
an organization. Governance process refers to
the interunit or interfirm activities that accompany
exchange within the framework of the governance
structure.
We argue that viewing relational governance
in terms of both structure and process is important
since a combination of structural and processual
dimensions more completely describes the complexity of such intermediate relationships than
either the structure or the process dimension
alone. Of course, structure and process are
closely related, as we discuss in more detail later.
The choice of the form of governance, specifically
the determination of the appropriate governance
structure and process, is broadly defined as the
interorganizational strategy of the firm. More
specifically, since we develop our theoretical and
empirical arguments in the contexts of a vertical
exchange relationship, we can refer to this type
of interorganizational strategy as a vertical control
strategy. In this paper, we use the two terms
interchangeably.-^
Quasi-integration as a structural dimension
We define vertical quasi-integration as a 'close
relationship which is based primarily upon the
[firm's] dependence for a significant proportion
of its total business upon a particular [firm]'
(Blois, 1972: 267). Blois asserts that a relationship
of this type involves an interdependence between
the two firms such that it 'can be considered as
a type of vertical integration without the legal
form' (1972: 268). We argue that this is a
structural dimension of governance, since it

more precise view is offered by Mahoney (1992) thai vertical

captures the transactional form of the dyad in
terms of the extent of market or hierarchical
mediation of transactions. The rationale for
conceptualizing quasi-integration as governance

single buyer. Although such a situation does not
automatically imply a hierarchical relationship.
for exchange could conceivably be based entirely
on price, in practical terms it is rare to find pure
price-based contracts in these contexts. Such a
relationship in fact would be tantamount to a
hierarchical one if exchange occurred repeatedly.
As Macneil (1978: 898) notes, '[a]s contractual
relations expand, those relations take on more
and more the characteristics of mini societies
and mini states.' Eccics (1981) calls stable,
long-term relationships between contractors and
subcontractors "quasi-firms' for the same reason.
We argue that higher degrees of quasiintegration imply a stable, long-term relationship
between buyer and supplier. This form of
relationship is distinct from a spot market,
occasional transaction, for it implies continuing
transactions between buyer and seller. When
quasi-integration is high, the expectation is that
the volume of such transactions account for a
significant proportion of the seller's output over
multiple periods of time. Our use of vertical
quasi-integration as a manifestation of governance
is consistent with previous empirical research,
such as John and Weitz (1988), testing transaction
cost explanations for vertical integration.
We further suggest that the higher the level
of quasi-integration, the greater the costs of
terminating the relationship for the exchange
partners (Kay, 1992). This proposition follows
from our previous argument that higher quasiintegration generally implies a larger component
of nonprice, or 'hierarchical' elements in the
relationship. The existence of such nonprice
elements in an exchange relationship suggests a
relational contract, and we argue that terminating
a relational contract is costlier than terminating
a discrete contract.
Joint action as a process dimension
Joint action reflects a move toward closer
relationships which 'involves the parties carrying
out the focal activities in a cooperative or
coordinated way' (Heide and John, 1990: 25).

Joint action serves as a safeguard for transactionspecific investments since firms that invest in
relationships with other firms would like to
reduce the risks of opportunistic appropriation
by getting involved in joint activities (Leenders
and Blenkhom, 1988). Joint action is viewed as
governance process since it comprises a set of
decision process mechanisms that determine the
terms of exchange between the members of the
dyad (Achrol, Reve, and Stern. 1983) and due
to its focus on future exchange and implications
of a cooperative endeavor. The rationale is that
the joint responsibility for the activities of the
dyad will serve to protect the party with specific
assets from their appropriation. From a macroorganization perspective, joint action provides
an appropriate mechanism for planning and
forecasting, in addition to the coopting of
environmental elements, and thus would appear
to serve as a process counter to organizational
dependence by reducing the uncertainty caused
for the organization by environmental elements
(Thompson, 1967; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978).
Determinants of governance Trom the
transaction cost perspective
We consider three key determinants of transaction
costs—(a) the degree of transaction-specific assets
(or asset specificity); (b) the level of uncertainty;
and (c) the extent of reciprocal investments—in
this section. Asset specificity, by creating a small
numbers exchange condition, has been argued
to be a key source of transaction costs. Similarly,
uncertainty has been a prominent factor in
previous empirical studies of vertical integration
using the transaction cost approach (e.g., Anderson and Schmittlein, 1984). Reciprocal investments (or reciprocal asset specificity) refer to
transaction-specific investments by the other
party to the exchange and are akin to being a
mirror image of asset specificity. Reciprocal
assets may tend to moderate opportunism by
serving as 'hostages' in an exchange (Williamson,
1985).
Asset specificity as a determinant of transaction
costs
Asset specificity has been extensively employed in
empirical research (see, for instance, Monteverde
and Teece, 1982; Walker and Weber, 1984;

<-----Page 6----->Relational Governance
the 'cognitive' dimension of trust is close to
'calculative' trust, while the 'affective' trust dimension probably includes the altruistic type of trust.
However, the 'behavioral' dimension of trust does
not fit neatly within a calculative- altruistic
dichotomy, but could include elements of both.
Williamson (1993) suggests that the term 'trust'
should be reserved for the personal, altruistic
version alone, and commercial relations cannot
include trust defined in this manner. We modify
this conception of trust in three important ways:
first, we believe that trust is a complex notion, and
that calculativeness, or a cognitive component, is
one element of trust. However, trust is a
'"leap" beyond the expectations that reason and
experience alone would warrant—they simply
serve as the platform from which the leap is
made' (Lewis and Weigert, 1985: 970). Thus.
both the rational calculation and the 'leap of
faith' comprise trust. Second, we allow for a
sizable sociological component of trust, captured
by the 'mutuality' intrinsic in the notion of
interorganizational trust. Thus, trust begets trust,
and a situation develops where 'I trust because
you trust' (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). Third, we
believe that such a form of trust is common in
business relationships, even in the West.
Considerable evidence exists to support the
idea that dyadic business relationships often have
a strong non-economic flavor. In this regard,
the social embeddedness of economic actions
(Granovetter, 1985) is noteworthy, as is the
tendency for commercial relationships to be
closely interwoven with personal ones, which has
been documented both in the West and in Japan
(Macauley, 1%3; Dore, 1983, 1987). Thus, our
focus in this research is on trust as a property
of the interorganizational dyad, and is primarily
sociological in nature, although we believe that
trust is a multidimensional concept, significantly
developed on affective, behavioral and cognitive
bases as well.
The rationale for the key role of trust is
straightforward: in the extreme case, it does away
with formal contracts, which are costly to write,
monitor and enforce (Bromiley and Cummings,
1991). Thus, trust acts to reduce transaction costs
by reducing or eliminating both ex ante and ex
post opportunism. Arguing from a pure transaction
cost viewpoint, therefore, the presence of trust
should be associated with a lower level of
hierarchical governance since trust serves as a

379

substitute for hierarchical control. These arguments
are formalized in the hypothesis below:
Hypothesis 4a: Trust is negatively and significantly associated with greater degrees of quasiintegration.
However, the above reasoning assumes that
increased trust levels precede the observed
governance form. Put another way, an argument
that asserts that interorganizational trust is in
place before safeguards are established makes
assumptions about the temporal structure of the
model, which we are not in a position to test
conclusively since ours is a cross-sectional rather
than a longitudinal study. If on the other hand
we argue that it is the increased levels of quasiintegration or the extent of recurrent exchange
that gave rise to the observed level of trust, then
it would imply a hypothesis with the signs
reversed, or that closer interorganizational ties
will be associated with higher levels of trust. From
a sociological perspective the latter hypothesis,
which we term the alternate hypothesis, appears
to have greater force validity. The corresponding
hypothesis relating governance structure to the
levels of trust in the relationship is as follows:
Hypothesis 4b: Trust is positively and significantly associated with greater degrees of quasiintegration.
The complementary role of the two perspectives
We argue that the inclusion of the sociological
perspective, expressed as trust, will add significantly to the explanatory power to the models
of transaction cost explanations of the structure
of governance, for the reasons discussed in earlier
sections. We test this assertion through the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5: A model of quasi-integration
that includes variables from both the economic
and sociological perspectives will have significantly increased explanatory power than a
model that includes only the economic variables.

the insurance agencies in the sample supports
our contention of the validity of reliance on a
single, senior-level informant.

Details of the constructs and the ope rationalizations are provided in Table 1 and are discussed
below.

Overview
We collected the required data during spring
1991 by means of questionnaires mailed to a
stratified random sample of 1000 independent
agencies who are members of the National
Association of Professional Insurance Agents
(PIA). Stratification was done on the basis of
agency size (in terms of premium volume) and
product mix (ratio of personal to commercial lines
business), in order to improve representativeness
from the sample frame. Responses were received
from 329 agencies representing an effective
response rate of 33 percent. Assessment of
nonresponse bias indicated no serious concerns
across the waves of responses.^ Within this
sample, the mean agency size in terms of annual
commercial premiums was $4 million.

Measurements

Asset specificity
We measured asset specificity in terms of six
indicators capturing both the procedural and the
human aspects of asset specificity in our research
context. The former was operationalized as a set
of three indicators that captured the extent to
which the focal carrier workflows and routines
were customized. Human asset specificity measured in terms of the extent to which the skill
levels of our employees working on the focal
carrier's business are specifically customized. All
the indicators were measured on a seven-point
scale from 'significantly customized' to 'relatively
similar to other carriers'. The Cronbach a
measure of reliability for this construct is 0.86.

Informant

Uncertainty

With the objective of minimizing key-informant
bias (Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982). we sought to
identify knowledgeable informant(s) as well as
assess the feasibility and benefits of multiple
informants during the initial round of interviews.
As most agencies are owner-managed, we chose
the owner as our only informant since no other
person has the vantage point for providing the
data relevant for this study. This approach is
consistent with the general recommendation to
use the most knowledgeable informant (Huber
and Power, 1985; Venkatraman and Grant, 1986)
and the research practice of relying on a single
senior-level informant in studies involving small
organizational units (see, for instance. Daft
and Bradshaw, 1980). The small number of
commercial personnel (mean: less than four) of

Behavioral uncertainty was operationalized with
two indicators regarding the uncertainty the
agency perceives due to the pricing and the new
product introduction actions of the focal carder.
The Cronbach a reliability for this construct was
marginal, but acceptable, at 0.61.'*

* There were no statistically significant differences between

Reciprocal investments
Reciprocal investments in our research take
the form of the extent of transaction-specific
resources invested by the insurance carrier in the
development of the relationship with the agency.
Specifically, these resources include support such
as consultation regarding business processes, and
the individual effort given to developing personal
relationships at the agency by the field and office

model of relational governance with its determinants and its outcomes—in terms of its structural

Analysis
We employed hierarchical regression analysis
(Cohen and Cohen, 1975) to test Hypotheses
1 through 7. This procedure allows us not only
to estimate the statistical significance of the
coefficients corresponding to our set of hypotheses but also to assess changes in the proportion
of variance explained {R^) and the statistical
significance of the changes with the introduction
of each new block of variables. We began by
regressing quasi-integration on the variables
that explain governance from the transaction
cost perspective—asset specificity, uncertainty,
and reciprocal investments—and added the
construct representing the sociological component of exchange: trust. We then assessed the
statistical significance of the change in R^ when
the new block was added. Next, we regressed
joint action, the process outcome of governance,
on quasi'integration, and added the trust
construct, assessing the significance of the
change R~ as before. Conceptually, the stages
in the analysis can be represented by the
following equations:

Consistent with our conceptualization of quasiintegration as the degree of the independent
agent's dedication to its focal carrier, we measure
this construct in terms of the percentage of
business (commercial premiums) directed to the
focal carrier. This indicator is consistent with
John and Weitz (1988), who view forward
integration as 'percentage of direct sales to endusers'. In the analysis, we use a transformed
version of this variable, consistent with Caves
and Bradburd (1988). Quasi-integration can serve
as a safeguard for specific assets by increasing
the carrier's costs of termination since, in this
market, carriers with larger agency shares also
have business with lower loss ratios.' Thus,

DISCUSSION
Asset specificity
Our empirical tests found support for the classic
transaction cost variable of asset specificity,
consistent with previous empirical research. In
accordance with transaction cost reasoning, asset
specificity was positively and significantly related
to the structural dimension of governance. One
distinctive aspect of this research relates to our
operationalization of asset specificity in terms of
both human and procedural asset specificity.
where the latter is analogous to organization
routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982). Such routines
embody a powerful form of transaction-specific
assets in service firms with strong vertical
linkages.
Uncertainty
The coefficient for uncertainty was not statistically
significant in the model. In order to be consistent
with previous empirical research on transaction
costs (e.g., Anderson, 1985), an alternative
specification of the model was tested, with an
interaction term between uncertainty and asset
specificity. The coefficient was again found to
be non-significant.
In fact, the construct of uncertainty has proved
controversial due to contradictory empirical
findings. For instance, counter to the classic
transaction cost arguments, Harrigan (1985b)
found that uncertainty was negatively related to
vertical integration, as did Baiakrishnan and
Wernerfelt (1986). The latter authors argued that
this empirical finding was due to their having
operationalized uncertainty as technological
uncertainty of high specificity, which would
decrease the likelihood of investment in such
technology. However, others (e.g., Monteverde
and Teece, 1982) have demonstrated that when
the form of technological uncertainty stems
from the requirements of coordinating complex
technical systems, a positive relationship between
uncertainty and internalization is observed. Our
operationalization of this construct is consistent
with Williamson (1985), who views uncertainty

387

in terms of uncertainty about the actions of
the exchange partner. Despite ope rationalizing
uncertainty as behavioral uncertainty, the construct emerged non-significant. Further, it was
negatively signed, which was contradictory to
transaction cost predictions.
Alternatively, it is possible that the nature of
this statistical relationship is nonlinear, and one
may speculate that when increased hierarchical
coordination leads to an ambiguous change
in control over uncertainty, organizations in
intermediate governance modes will reduce rather
than increase their degree of hierarchical coordination when uncertainty is high, if total integration is not a possibility. Of course (as a
reviewer pionts out), our operationalization of
hierarchy as quasi-integration is not identical to
the class transaction cost conception, which could
account for the construct of uncertainty being
non-significant with respect to governance choice.
Also, in terms of measurement, the uncertainty
construct itself was weaker than we would have
liked. However, our results are consistent with
a temporal explanation that closer ties reduce
behavioral uncertainty.
Reciprocal investments
We introduced and operationalized the concept
of reciprocal investments in a model of relational
governance, and found that this variable was a
not significant explanatory factor of structural
governance outcomes. However, we note that
the correlation between reciprocal investments
and joint action is strong and significant,
r = 0.378 (Table 2). This result suggests that
reciprocal investments may play a salient role in
joint action, although we did not specify such a
relationship ex ante.
On the other hand, if reciprocal investments
in the relationship are viewed once again from
a sociological perspective as reciprocity, possibly
including a dynamic component, then the strong
observed correlation between reciprocal investments and joint action becomes both theoretically
and intuitively plausible. Thus, for example,
norms of reciprocity and reciprocal action theory
(Gouldner, I960) imply that each partner in the
exchange relationship responds to the actions
taken by the other in a reciprocal fashion.
Exchange theory (Homans, 1%1) and equity
norms (Blau. 1964) are similar expressions of

<-----Page 15----->388

A. Zaheer and N. Venkatraman

conditions supporting stable exchange relationships. Reciprocal action serves as the basis for
mutual commitment (Dwyer et al.., 1987) and
symmetric levels of commitment favor longevity
and stability in relationships. The recognition in
the game-theoretic literature of infinite horizon
games and the empirical demonstration that a
tit-for-tat strategy is most optimal under those
circumstances (Axelrod, 1984) provides further
evidence for the role of reciprocity in long-term
relational exchange. We suggest that as attention
to interorganizational strategy increases, consideration should be given to reciprocal investments and reciprocity in research on governance.
Trust
The role of trust, although consistent with
an alternative hypothesis based on sociological
explanations, was found to be the opposite of
what was hypothesized from a pure transaction
cost viewpoint. In order to further investigate
the phenomenon of trust as it relates to governance, we tested the moderating role of trust as
well. We introduced an interaction term of trust
and asset specificity in a mode! of quasiintegration which included the main effects terms,
and found the coefficient of the interaction term
moderately significant (p < 0.1). The coefficient
was again positively signed, suggesting that higher
levels of trust interact with asset specificity to
increase the extent of hierarchical governance.
However, from a sociological perspective, the
results are supportive of extant work and
intuition; simply that higher levels of trust are
found in closer relationships.
The role of trust is more salient in the process
manifestation of governance, for the addition of
a relational factor is instrumental in increasing
the extent of variance explained in joint action.
The presence of trust as an explanatory factor
for the structural manifestation of governance,
quasi-integration, may therefore be due to
reputation and other effects that may be present
at the time of the formation of the relationship.
While temporal effects may partly explain the
positive relationship of trust with both the process
and structural aspects of governance, further
research is needed to explicate the particular role
of this construct in transaction cost explanations of
interfirm relationships. The influence of trust
deriving from embedded personal relationships

in interfirm dyads also merits closer research
attention.
Governance structure and process
Our research makes a modest contribution
to the organizational economics literature by
offering operationalizations of both a structural
view (quasi-integration) and a process view
(joint action) of governance, and in empirically
investigating, however preliminarily, the phenomenon of relational governance and the role of
trust in interfirm exchange. Our contention is
that conceptualizations of governance, especially
pertaining to interfirm relationships, should
extend beyond the traditional structural aspects
to begin including the processual elements, often
key to understanding such relationships and
indeed, a good deal of organizational and
interorganizational behavior (Marrett, 1971).
Our results suggest that merely adopting an
appropriate govemance structure may not lead to
the required process outcomes of governance, for
the govemance structure explained only a small
amount of variance in govemance process. A
dynamic view of the role of trust in relational
governance asserts that recurrent transactions may
provide a context for the development of trust over
time (Ring and Van de Ven. 1992), contributing to
the observed strong relationship between trust and
govemance process. In turn, this may stimulate the
development of process safeguards for transactionspecific assets, such as standard operating procedures and other mechanisms that favor stable,
long-term, relational govemance relationships. In
this vein, Heide and Miner (1992) demonstrated
the value of process elements in interorganizational
relationships and called for research using multiple
theories. However, they do not specifically demonstrate results from botii structural and process
theories.
Multiple perspectives in interorganizational
research
This research has been motivated by a desire to
integrate economic and noneconomic perspectives
to understand a hybrid form of interorganizational
strategy, namely relational governance. This
integration is important as the two sets of
theoretical arguments may together provide
complementary insights into this theoretically

<-----Page 16----->Relational Governance
and empircally important phenomenon. Support
for the structural manifestation of govemance
from both transaction cost and sociological
viewpoints suggests that the economic determinants of govemance do not by themselves provide
a complete understanding of the phenomenon.
Rather, as we demonstrate empirically, the
combination of variables from independent theoretical perspectives, economics and sociology,
contributes to an understanding of the Interorganizational phenomenon.
The use of diverse but complementary perspectives in the examination of a phenomenon such
as interorganizational exchange has a number of
successful precedents in the strategic management
and organization literature. In addition to Hansen
and Wemerfelt (1989). who combined behavioral
and economic approaches empirically, a number
of research streams have been developed by
theoretical interdisciplinary contributions. Nelson
and Winter's (1982) addition of organizational
phenomena such as routines to economic aspects
of firms, itself following in a tradition of March
and Simon (1958) and Cyert and March (1963),
generates useful insights into firm behavior. More
recently, Milgrom and Roberts (1992) have added
formalized behavioral components, in the form
of influence costs and bargaining costs, to the
transaction costs framework, which had already
appended behavioral dimensions—the assumptions of bounded rationality and opportunism—
to the economic ones of uncertainty and small
numbers (Williamson, 1975).

389

We have taken some license in this paper to
speculate on causal and temporal linkages, while
operating within the confines of a cross-sectional
study. Clearly, a longitudinal study to capture
the dynamics of the development of relational
governance would be highly appropriate to test
the assertions made herein. Further, from a
theoretical point of view, it would be useful to
develop a richer set of constructs beyond the
four developed here to capture the determinants
of relational govemance.
Finally, investigating the performance implications of forms of relational govemance is
another important lacuna in current research
(Heide and John. 1988, is an exception). Whereas
the transaction cost literature, due to its economic
antecedents, has been less concemed with performance than with demonstrating that theoretically predicted forms exist, this approach is based
on some fairly stringent assumptions. Thus, it is
generally assumed that efficient forms will exist
and that inefficient forms will tend toward
efficiency or be forced to exit. When we factor
in organizational inertia (Hannan and Freeman,
1984), disequilibrium (Robins. 1987), and something less than complete knowledge of costs
of governance (Dow, 1987), the performance
implications of alternative govemance mechanisms become considerably more relevant. One
approach would be to demonstrate that deviations
from theoretically predicted forms are associated
with inferior performance.

Directions for future research

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Several future research directions seem promising. From the perspective of research design, a
useful advance would be to obtain information
on interorganizational constructs from both sides
of the interfirm dyad. This will enable crossvalidation of inherently relationship-oriented constructs like trust, and permit more valid measures
of constructs which relate to the other party,
such as reciprocal investments. Further, obtaining
data from both sides of the dyad would also
permit the modeling of differing perceptions on
the same phenomena. Other design possibilities
include the use of multiple respondents to
improve the validity of organization-level constructs, particularly if larger firms are included
in the sample (Bagozzi and Phillips. 1982).

This paper integrated economic and sociological
perspectives to explain the determinants of
relational governance. Our empirical results
support the assertions by Macnei! (1980), Granovetter (1985) and others that there exists a
significant social component in exchange relationships which may be masked or missed in economic
explanations of exchange. The two combined
perspectives explained a significantly greater
proportion of the variance in the structural
manifestation of intermediate forms of interorganizational relationships. Further, the structural dimension by itself was inadequate in
explaining the processual aspects of relational
governance. The addition of the sociological
perspective, captured in the tmst construct.
