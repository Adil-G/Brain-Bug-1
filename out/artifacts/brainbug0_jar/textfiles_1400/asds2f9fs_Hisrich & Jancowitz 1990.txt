Even though the formal venture capital industry is a major source ofjnancing, particularly second- and third-stagefinancing,
some of the aspects of
the investment decision have been little researched. One aspect in particular
is the nature and extent of intuitive, “personal chemistry” or “gutfeel” decisions involved; these arefrequently mentionedas important by venture capitalists themselves, but have been little researched by workers in thejeld.
In order to develop an understanding of intuition, this study employed a unique technique-the
repertory grid-drawnfrom
personal construct psychology. Using this technique, the ways in which venture capitalists construe (think about or ascribe personal meaning to) investment proposals were identi$ed
in a series of in-depth interviews.
The results indicate that investment decision constructs can be grouped into three areas-management, unique opportunity, and appropriate return, thefirst two areas involving the largest number of
constructs rejecting such concerns as the experience of theprincipal, the personality and background of
the principal, the characteristics of the management team, the “interpersonal chemistry” involved, and
a preference for a pragmatic rather than creative entrepreneur. Principal component analyses indicate
the relationships between these concerns and reveal relatively low cognitive complexity: essentially, just
one or two major areas of emphasis predominate in each venture capitalist’s thinking.
Notwithstanding these general trendsacross the venturecapitalistsstudied,
cluster analysis showed
that each venture capitalist had his own way of structuring the institutions involved in an investment
decision. TheseJindings suggest that individuals seeking venture capital might need to adjust their approach to different venture capitalists, recognizing the divers@ involved.

and research in the field before 1981. Given the importance of venture capital financing in
economic development, it is not surprising that the area has emerged as a topic of intense
interest and research activity. Work since 1981 has focused on six primary topics: portfolio
of venture capital firms, investment decision, operations, strategy, impact on the entrepreneur, and public policy. The academic contributions on each topic from 1981 through 1987
have been reviewed in a recent article (Fried and Hisrich 1988).
One of these topics of critical importance to government officials, entrepreneurs, and
the financial community concerns the nature of the investment decision-making
process.
Investment decisions are rarely self-evident in the sense that a standard operating algorithm
or decision-making procedure is sufficient. The venture capital decision can be distinguished
from asset-based investment decisions by the value of the assets involved and by the extent
to which information, policies, and personal beliefs and values are combined into a final
judgment by a subjective process on the part of the venture capitalist. While the information
used by the capitalist is highly quantified (comprising balance sheets, pro forma statement,
market information, asset evaluations, and the like), subjective qualitative evaluations about
the information lie at the heart of the decision to be made.
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) found that venture capital firms in high-tech areas evaluate
proposals in light of their product-market attractiveness, product differentiation, management
capability, resistance to environmental threat, and cash-out potential. Another study focusing
on the relationship between investment criteria and performance indicated that management
staying power and familiarity with the market were judged to be the most important characteristics of a successful venture (MacMillan et al. 1987). Moreover, these management
characteristics dominated the investment decisions across the sample, even though there was
variation in the specific, quantitative investment criteria among the different venture capitalists surveyed.
Much remains unanswered.
What particular subjective factors underlie the overall
evaluation? Given the intuitive aspects of the process, how can existing investment criteria
be improved? How does an individual evaluate the importance of factors such as familiarity
with the market, management staying power, and potential risk? How are these specifics
structured (interrelated) in the mind of the venture capitalist prior to being translated into
the terms of the particular deal, given the return desired?
The answers to these questions as well as an initial understanding of the investment
decision process of the individual venture capitalist requires an understanding of “gut feeling”
or intuition. Defined as a “felt awareness for a situation as a whole” (Bastick 1982), intuition
involves an integration of disparate information, some of which is not necessarily related
to the issue at hand (whether to invest in a particular proposal). Once formed, the intuition,
though based on diverse items, can lead to generalizations and conclusions about the overall
proposal which probably would not have occurred from separate consideration of each item
of information involved.

METHODOLOGY
A series of lengthy in-depth interviews with five venture capitalists was used to obtain
information about the particular constructs each respondent uses in thinking about investment
proposals, the objective being to obtain systematic information on the content and structure
of intuitions prior to the development of a questionnaire to be issued to a larger sample of
respondents.
The interviews were structured by means of the repertory grid technique, a methodology

<-----Page 2----->INTUITION IN VENTURE CAPITAL DECISIONS

based on the rationale that people ascribe significance to all phenomena (including investment
proposals!) by means of their construct system (Kelly 1955). The system consists of interrelated constructs, bipolar attributes applied by the individual to the phenomena in question.
In other words, each individual ascribes meaning to events in terms of such terms as “pleasant
_ unpleasant, ” “happy - sad,” or in the case of venture capital decisions, “good management
skills - poor management skills, ” “experienced principal - inexperienced principal,” and so
forth. The purpose of a repertory grid interview is to identify the constructs a respondent
typically uses, since it is by means of these constructs that the respondent construes (ascribes
meaning and significance to) his or her world. Constructs are also predictions about how
events are likely to develop (a proposal construed as coming from a principal who lacks
experience in the particular market aimed at is likely to be less successful than a proposal
based on extensive product-market experience). If one views the investment decision as a
prediction of success of the venture in question, then the repertory grid technique appears
to offer a highly relevant framework and methodology for identifying the content and structure
of venture capitalists’ intuitions about the proposals put before them (Stewart and Stewart
1982).
The grid interview proceeded as follows. Each venture capitalist was asked to recall
six proposals made during the previous 18 months, referring to filed proposal documents as
necessary. Two proposals had to be “big hits,” two were average or marginal performances,
and two were not, in the event, funded. These became the elements under examination.
Each respondent was asked to express these outcomes on a simple “Overall Less
Satisfactory - Overall More Satisfactory” five-point rating scale. This was the only scale
supplied by the interviewer: repertory grid technique proceeds by eliciting all further constructs from the respondent by means of a series of successive comparisons between elements.
That is, each respondent was asked to indicate “what aspects of the proposals contribute
to this Overall Assessment: what intuitions or gut feelings lead you to make this assessment?”
following a standard elicitation procedure. This consists of offering three elements at a time
and asking the respondent to state in what way two of the three are alike, and thereby
different from the third, “in terms of how good a case is made for investment.” The response
is a construct: a pair of phrases of opposite meaning, one part expressing what the two
elements have in common, the other part expressing the way in which the third element
differs from the pair. For example, if two of the proposals are perceived to involve vulnerability to competition in the early years, in contrast to the third, which is perceived as
resistant to any competition that might occur, then this contrast would be written down as
“Vulnerable to Competition - Resistant to Competition” and be regarded as a construct.
Since the construct posits a contrast, it can be recorded in the form of a bipolar rating
scale and used by the respondent to rate all six proposals. Further combinations of three
elements are then offered repeatedly, until no new constructs emerge. Figure 1 provides an
example of a completed repertory grid.
Subsequent to this procedure, the ratings of all elements on all constructs were analyzed;
cluster analysis and principal components analysis were used to show the relationship between
each construct and the overall assessment of the proposals making up the element set and
to reveal the particular way in which the respondent in question structured all the constructs
involved.
The repertory grid is procedurally simple, but requires skillful and sensitive depthinterviewing technique. The standard procedural manual is Stewart and Stewart (1982).
Jankowicz (1987) can be referred to for examples of a completed repertory grid, and Jankowicz (in press), for a detailed review of applications in business research and consultancy

(what they actually say about the proposals used), how these embody their intuitions about
the typical proposal, and, secondly, on how these intuitions are structured.

Most venture capitalists prefer that the important issues in an investment decision are
found in three areas: Management, Unique Opportunity, and Appropriate Return. The most
numerous constructs concerned the first of these issues, Management: respondents construed
funding proposals in terms of the experience of the principal (five constructs), the personality
and background of the principal (six constructs), and the characteristics of the management
team supporting the principal (four constructs).
The positively evaluated pole of all these constructs was easy to discern. Management
experience at a strategic level (perhaps as head of a corporate division), a track record of
success in companies with which there was a previous association, and relevant experience
in the same industry were highly valued. Additionally, principals who were highly technically
educated, had a clear goal orientation, and personnel management skills were clearly preferred.
Two issues (while represented by a single construct each) were expressed with such
strength of conviction that they are also worthy of separate mention. One venture capitalist
looked for a principal with whom he could be personally comfortable-a
matter of interpersonal “chemistry” rather than a characteristic solely attributable to the proposer. Another
respondent stressed that he explicitly avoided the creative principal, construing “creativity”
as the opposite of “pragmatism,”
and preferring the latter. He looked for a systematic
implementer who would dot all the “i’s” and cross all the “t’s.” One wonders how idiosyncratic such constructs might be. However, if the relationship between the two people, venture
capitalist and principal, did not “feel right” to the venture capitalist, the proposal would
probably not be taken further, regardless of its other merits. Also, the proposer had to be
supported by a team with financial, production, and, particularly, marketing skills.
While the continuity of the company (seven constructs) was seen as particularly important, a simple preference was not expressed. Lack of an established resource base for a
product involving a business startup was negatively evaluated in the case of some proposals
but not in others. Similarly, a plan to utilize significant proportions of the capital provided
for the further development of the new product was negatively evaluated in some proposals
but not in others. In other words, intuitions concerning the continuity of the company making
the proposal depended on other factors, primarily the experience of the principal and his
supporting team.
Unique Opportunity represented the largest single category of constructs, with nine
distinct mentions. Several of the respondents construed the issue as a contrast between

<-----Page 5----->54

finding a specific market niche and selling a commodity that was seen by some as a “metoo” product. The unique product, which created a new niche for itself and might easily be
developed and tailored into related spinoffs, was clearly preferred. However, this uniqueness
was not necessarily dependent on technological innovation, since only two constructs dealt
with this issue. In neither of these two cases was the sheer “sexiness” or excitement of the
product straightforwardly associated with a positive or negative evaluation.
Appropriate Return was mentioned relatively rarely. The need for an adequate return
was directly mentioned once and indirectly once. This latter construct viewed the principal’s
knowledge of what involvement with a venture capitalist would cost in terms of profit sharing
and shared equity, as an indicator of the sophistication and hence acceptability of the proposal
in question.

Structure of Venture Capitalists’ Intuitions
The ratings in each completed grid were cluster-analyzed
to identify ways in which the
individual venture capitalists structured their thinking about investment applications (Jankowicz and Thomas 1982, 1983), using software based on Thomas’s “Focus” algorithm,
which uses a nearest-neighbor distance metric. (This computes summed differences between
pairs of ratings in each grid, calculating first by columns and then by rows. The most
similarly rated constructs are then reordered to lie side by side in the cluster-analyzed
grid
shown in Figure 2.)
The result is a graphic representation of the implicational connections made by each
respondent: the personal theory that each venture capitalist employs in making a funding
decision.
Respondent 1 shows one main construct cluster (Figure 2a), with “Market Understandand “Value Added” clustering closely with
ing, ” “Stronger People, ” “Equity Involvement,”

product (“Niche” as opposed to “Commodity,”
the form of ownership (“Constant” versus
“Leverage Buyout”), and the nature of the company (“Startup” versus “Established”) are
somewhat less closely related to the other constructs and constitute issues to which he gives
separate and distinct consideration.
Respondent 2 shows a looser structure. In other words, the various constructs are
applied as somewhat separate ways of evaluating a proposal. One subcluster associates the
technical education of the principal with technically developed products aimed at market
niches, another group’s management skill, experience, and existence of a good support team.
The size of supporting assets is associated most closely with the Overall Assessment of the
proposal, and the nature of the company (“Startup” as opposed to “Existing”) forms a separate
concern.
Respondent 3 shows one distinct cluster and a second set of somewhat less interrelated
constructs. The former is most interesting, as the constructs are highly matched (over 90%)
with the Overall Assessment. In effect, the summary judgment of a proposal by this venture
capitalist is dominated by his impression of personal quality of the proposer (which was
described in terms of experience, education, and flair-see
the appendix) and of the match
between his own personality and that of the proposer. In other words, the “chemistry” has
to be right. The remaining constructs, which concern the nature of the product and the nature
of the proposal team, form a separate group to be considered, with the nature of the company
(“Established” versus “Startup”) being unrelated to the main structure.

FIGURE 2 How venture capitalists structure their thinking about investment proposals. Constructs
used by each respondent are listed below. The “tree-diagram” at the right shows connections in the
respondent’s thinking. Constructs joined along adjacent “branches” are closer together in the respondent’s mind than those joined along non-adjacent branches. The scale shows the percentage similarity
of constructs, calculated from the respondent’s original ratings (Fig. 1): follow any pair of adjacent
branches to the right until they meet; read up from that point onto the scale. For example, there’s a
93% match between “Cost Understanding” and “Performance” in the first respondent’s thinking (lines
in bold). Whenever he says “Successful Performance” he also says “Good Understanding of Costs,”
and vice-versa.

Respondent 4 shows one very tight cluster in which the Overall Assessment of a
proposal is characterized by Pragmatism of the principal, good Team Support, the existence
of a good Business Plan, and effective Operating Management in the company, each having
an important but slightly diminishing bearing on the Overall Assessment. The remaining
constructs (“Product Excitement,” “Structure of the Deal,” “Type of Market,” and “Management Training”) form separate issues.
Respondent 5 shows one tight cluster: “Commodity” products are vulnerable to “Early
Competition,” while in contrast, products that find a unique “Market Niche” can “Hold off
Competition.” This venture capitalist also has two somewhat loose clusters concerned with

Overall, these structural descriptions showed some degree of diversity with the Overall
Assessment clustering with rather different constructs in each case; in other words, while
venture capitalists draw on a fairly common set of constructs they relate them together
differently and form their Overall Impression of a proposal (and hence make a decision to
invest) by focusing on different groupings of the constructs.

Themes Underlying the Venture Capitalists’ Thinking
The structural relationships outlined above are relative rather than absolute. They focus on
idiographic descriptions within individual repertory grids and may represent a substantial
uniformity of view across the individuals themselves. Table 2 addresses this issue and
summarizes the results of separate principal component analyses of each individual grid.
Differences in the ways in which people construe issues can be summarized in terms
of cognitive complexity-the
extent to which an individual takes into account markedly
different aspects of an issue in thinking about it (high complexity), as opposed to viewing
it in terms of one or two preponderant themes which dominate his thinking. A useful rule
of thumb in repertory grid work is to regard a situation in which 60% or more of variance
is accounted for by the first principal component as an indication of low cognitive complexity
(Smith and Stewart 1977; Smith 1980). As can be seen from Table 2, all respondents show
relatively low complexity with just one or two themes dominating their thinking.
Two principal component solutions are provided in Figure 3: the loose construct
structure characteristic of high cognitive complexity and the tight structure characteristic of

low complexity. The second example shows, in the latter case, that “everything relates to
everything else”-the
constructs are plotted close together to the first (horizontal) principal
component. An inspection of the principal component labels given in Table 2 shows that
the preponderant themes involved in all five grids relate to the adequacy of management
associated with the proposal, either in the case of how the principal alone is construed or,
more frequently, how the management team as a whole is seen. Almost all of the remaining
constructs serve to amplify and qualify this predominant concern.

DISCUSSION
In addition to illustrating the use of a new technique-the
repertory grid-in
providing an
understanding of complex business decisions, the results of this preliminary study provide
some insights into the venture capital decision process. There was a predominant management
component in the investment decision with relatively few constructs dealing with the issue
of an adequate return on investment. This can be explained quite simply.
The focus of the repertory grid interviews was presented to respondents as involving
their intuitions about issues distinct from the more straightforward technical, production,
financial, and numeric projections on which the merits of a proposal might be judged, and
from which matters of startup/retooling
costs, risk, exposure, and appropriate return are
usually measured nonintuitively.
In effect, the venture capitalists were led to take Adequate
Return for granted, and volunteered relatively few constructs on this issue.
In this respect, the venture capitalists differ from bank commercial loan officers, a
source of funds that has been studied following identical assumptions and using the same
repertory grid technique. Jankowicz and Hisrich (1987) studied 20 loan officers making
small-business loan decisions in the $25,000 to $100,000 range and found that, with identical
instructions to focus more on the intuitive issues, nevertheless some 23% of constructs dealt
with profitability, collateral, and risk. As with the venture capitalists, however, constructs
dealing with the adequacy of management and the nature of the market predominated.
One way in which the venture capitalists differ from the bankers is in their low cognitive
complexity: a remarkably high proportion of the construct variance relates to a single theme,
that of adequacy of management, as remarked above. The difference between venture capitalists and bankers may arise from the way in which venture capital firms are structured.
The individual making the investment decision is frequently the chief executive, or a close
colleague with substantial equity exposure in what is a small organization; the loan officer
is someone relatively junior in his organization.
As Isenberg has found, the thinking of senior managers differs from their more junior
counterparts in its breadth of scope. Isenberg (1984: 84) reports that senior managers “were
preoccupied with a very limited number of quite general issues, each of which subsumed a
larger number of specific issues . . . regardless of its substance, the overriding concern
weaves its way in and out of all the manager’s daily activities, at times achieving the
dimensions of an all-consuming passion.” This word, “passion,” characterizes very well the
venture capitalist’s almost-obsessive concern with the managerial adequacy of the investment
proposal.
The matter of seniority of role may explain the existence of an overriding concern;
why this should be a concern for the adequacy of management, rather than any other factor,
is explained well by Gorman and Sahlman (1986). The venture capitalist is frequently the
lead investor in a new venture and spends substantial time dealing with issues of strategy,
face-to-face with the senior managers of the proposing company: capitalist and manager are

partnership roles with shared interests. When things go well, the interests coincide; when
things go poorly, however, these interests diverge, the partnership dissolves, and the venture
capitalist’s concern becomes focused on the adequacy of the senior managers with whom
he has been dealing. Clearly, once generated, this concern is not limited to existing investments, but is used to guide the capitalist’s thinking and intuitions regarding new proposals.
This similarity in basic orientation should not be allowed to obscure the differences
between venture capitalists in the ways in which this orientation is expressed and is used to
structure the constructs the capitalist uses, however. Further work is planned to explore these
issues with a larger sample and to identify the extent to which the findings relate to differences
in the philosophy, style, objectives, and industry specialty of the particular venture capital
corporation studied.
