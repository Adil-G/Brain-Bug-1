Abstract

Where do firms’ heterogeneous resources come from? Our qualitative, inductive study of nascent
firms over seven years revealed that founders’ use of emotion regulation behaviors can explain
differential resource creation at the firm level. These behaviors deal with three emotion-laden tensions that firm founders faced: (1) self versus other-orientation, (2) economic versus emotional

and facilitate resource creation for their ventures. We therefore call these emotion regulation behaviors “emotional reconciling.” Emotional reconciling could be construed as a dynamic capability that helps young firms establish a resource base. Our study contributes to the strategy literature by being the first to establish empirically the link between specific emotion regulation behaviors of founders and the emergence of resource heterogeneity at the firm level.

<-----Page 3----->INTRODUCTION
This study explores how founders of young firms regulate their own emotions and how
their emotion regulation influences differences among firms’ resource creation. By bringing in
affect, this study enriches a mainly cognition-focused understanding of the origins of firms’ resource heterogeneity. Understanding the various causes of firms’ resource heterogeneity has been
of great interest to scholars who seek to understand the firms’ competitive advantage through a
resource-based lens, because resource heterogeneity is linked to differential value creation and
firm rents (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993). As Peteraf and Barney
(2003: 311) noted, “Without differentiable resources, resource-based theory makes no contribution of its own and ceases to be a theory discrete from other analytical tools.” The causes of resource heterogeneity are also tied to the debate about why firms differ and how that matters (e.g.,
Nelson, 1991; Rumelt, Schendel and Teece, 1994).
Although resource heterogeneity is a key tenet (according to Peteraf (1993), a “cornerstone”) of resource-based theory, the various conditions under which it can arise have so far been
given relatively little attention, perhaps because they were originally thought to lie outside the
scope of the early resource-based theory research. Our knowledge about the origins of resource
heterogeneity is partly based on theoretical speculation about exogenous factors (some of which
Nelson (1991:65) calls “rather superficial” explanations) such as chance events or environmental
influences, path dependence, governmental largess and unevenly distributed property rights
(Barney, 1986; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Nelson, 1991; Foss and Foss, 2005; Peteraf and Barney,
2003). However, firm heterogeneity can also be an endogenous creation of economic actors (Mahoney and Pandian, 1992). These endogenous factors have largely been linked to managers’ cognitive processes such as managers’ bounded rationality in search, decision-making, and learning
(Castanias and Helfat, 2001; Nelson, 1991; Williams, 1994), cognitive development paths (Helfat

3

<-----Page 4----->and Peteraf, 2009), heuristics (Busenitz and Barney, 1997) and framing (Alvarez and Busenitz,
2001). As a result of these different cognitive processes, managers “choose somewhat different
strategies … [which] in turn will lead to firms having different structures and different core capabilities” (Nelson, 1991: 69). Although scholars generally recognize that “firms are different because of the actions of managers” (Williams, 1994: 244), actions that are shaped by cognition as
well as affect, we know relatively little about how affect influences the endogenous creation of
resources and the emergence of resource heterogeneity among firms. Specifically, the strategy
literature has yet to develop a fine-grained understanding of various kinds of affect-related managerial actions that produce resource heterogeneity.
To advance our knowledge in this domain, we follow prior suggestion that exploring the
intersection of the strategy and entrepreneurship fields of research could provide rich insights
(Hitt and Ireland, 2000). In particular, studying firm founders’ behaviors could shed further light
on the creation of resources and capabilities in firms (Alvarez and Barney, 2007; Alvarez and
Busenitz, 2001; Barney, Wright and Ketchen, 2001). Founders usually face obstacles in providing
and securing resources for their unproven organizations and thus experience emotionally intense
moments, for example, when faced with investors’ reluctance to fund the development of their
business models, customers’ skepticism about the viability of their offerings and organizations
(Hargadon and Douglas, 2001), or conflicts among key members of the new firm. Strong emotions can also be elicited by the high uncertainty related to the eventual success of their venture
(Baron, 2008) or the personal economic or social-emotional performance below aspiration levels
that founders often experience in their entrepreneurial pursuits (Gimeno et al., 1997). Negative
emotional episodes can be interspersed with moments of positive emotions when entrepreneurs
recognize breakthrough opportunities or achieve meaningful product or market development.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior empirical study has investigated systematically the

4

<-----Page 5----->various ways in which founders deal with their emotions– called emotion regulation (e.g., Gross,
1998; Gross and John, 2003)–and whether and how these behaviors contribute to resource creation. It might appear non-obvious that emotion regulation performed by founders could have important consequences for firm-level resources (e.g., financial support), especially when these resources are provided by constituencies other than the founders themselves. To show this link empirically and to illuminate its mechanisms are therefore the main objectives of this study. We ask
the following research question: What specific emotion regulation behaviours do founders use,
and how and why do these behaviours differentially affect resource creation in nascent firms?
To investigate this question, we adopted an inductive theory-building research design
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1994) because there are many possible kinds of emotion regulation behaviors that entrepreneurs could use and it is not clear which ones they actually practice (if any at
all). More importantly, the links between specific emotion regulation behaviors and organizational resource creation outcomes are neither well understood nor established empirically. We
therefore conducted a longitudinal study of six new ventures where founders exhibited varying
levels of emotion regulation.
Our analysis of the data revealed that founders’ differential use of emotion regulation behaviors at the personal level can explain differential resource creation (resource heterogeneity) at
the firm level. Specifically, we show that founders of new firms can foster resource creation by
enacting distinct modes (i.e., how certain actions are performed) and types (i.e., what actions are
performed) of emotion regulation. Interestingly, we found that these behaviors cluster around
three fundamental tensions for founders, which characterize the building of an organization: (1)
self versus other-orientation, (2) economic versus emotional rewards, and (3) short-term versus
long-term focus. We propose theoretically that emotion regulation helps founders reconcile the
seeming contradictions that are embedded in these tensions), and thereby facilitates resource crea-

5

<-----Page 6----->tion for their ventures. For example, by considering other people’s concerns, needs and preferences while performing (self-) emotion regulation, founders could reconcile the tension between
self and other. We will elaborate this and other tensions later. We capture this theoretical insight
by calling the process whereby founders enact the various emotion regulation behaviors to deal
with tensions “emotional reconciling.” We theorize that emotional reconciling could be a valuable
dynamic capability that helps young firms create a resource base.
Our study contributes to the strategy literature both empirically and theoretically. We
show empirically that the emergence of resource heterogeneity within a pool of young firms can
have “affective roots.” Indeed, our study may be the first to establish an empirical link between
specific affect-related personal behaviors of entrepreneurs and associated resource creation outcomes at the firm level. Furthermore, following Barney’s (2001) conjecture that “resource-based
models of strategic advantage may need to be augmented by theories of the creative and entrepreneurial process” (p. 53), our study provides two important theoretical insights. First, we illuminate the “front end” part of resource-based theory as articulated by Peteraf and Barney (2003).
Our empirically grounded model shows how resource heterogeneity is not just a starting point of
resource-based theorizing, but can result endogenously from founders’ affect-related actions.
Founders’ emotions as well as the actions with which they regulate them are not given ex-ante.
Since our model is predictive and offers clearly defined, operationalizable constructs, it could
enhance the predictive power and definitional clarity of resource-based theory.
Second, by taking managers’ (emotion regulation) actions as independent variables, and
deriving from them firms’ endowments with heterogeneous resources, we increase the distance
between the main assumptions and outcomes of resource-based theory, thereby reducing concerns
about potential tautology (e.g., resource characteristics defined in terms of their performance outcomes). Our conceptualization of resource creation as discretionary support and persistence pro-

6

<-----Page 7----->vided by founders, and as support from other stakeholders, aids in this respect because these services may produce (but are not perfectly associated with) a positive effect on the costs or benefits
of a firm’s outputs as determined in product markets. Our theory thus suggests a potential way by
which resource-based scholars can avoid the risk of circular reasoning (e.g., “valuable resources
lead to value”) that was noted by Priem and Butler (2001).
THE LINKS BETWEEN EMOTION REGULATION AND RESOURCE CREATION
A review of the emotion regulation literature gives us some understanding how it may be
important to founders’ ability to create resources for their nascent organizations. Resources are
the “specific physical (e.g., specialized equipment, geographic location), human (e.g., expertise in
chemistry), and organizational (e.g., superior sales force) assets that can be used to implement
value-creating strategies” (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000: 1107). But as Edith Penrose noted: “It is
never resources themselves that are the ‘inputs’ in the production process…only the services that
the resources can render” (1959:25). Building on this insight, we use the term “resource creation”
in this paper to denote the creation of services from resources. Accordingly, resource heterogeneity refers to the differential services that are obtained from the resources (e.g., managers working
harder and with greater loyalty or commitment in one firm than in another, or investors being
more likely to invest more money in one firm than in another). This is consistent with Peteraf’s
(1993:180) definition of resource heterogeneity as productive factors having intrinsically different
levels of ‘efficiency’ and enabling firms “to produce more economically and/or better satisfy customer wants.” At the same time, it also allows for a more dynamic treatment of the phenomenon
along the lines suggested by Feldman (2004:307), who views resources (or more precisely, in the
context of this paper, the services that they render) as dynamic, “created and recreated through
action.” A similar dynamic view is espoused by Foss and Foss (2005) who conceive of resources
as the outcomes of property-rights driven processes.

7

<-----Page 8----->Whether and how entrepreneurs regulate their varied emotional experiences could potentially differentially affect their ability to create resources, from themselves (e.g., regarding their
own effort and persistence in venture-building) as well as from others (e.g., regarding diverse
constituencies’ support and loyalty). Indeed, linking resource-based theory with emotion regulation is potentially fruitful because both perspectives share a concern with “economizing,” i.e.,
improving the efficiency of resources in terms of the services that they can render (Williamson,
1991) and with effective adaptation (Peteraf and Barney, 2003: 312).
Emotion regulation actions are behaviors that deliberately maintain or modify self emotional experiences to achieve specific goals (Gross and John, 2003; Côté, 2005). Emotion regulation includes all of the conscious and unconscious efforts to increase, maintain, or decrease one or
more components of an emotion (Gross, 1999). Emotions refer to bio-psychological systems that
mobilize various components including cognitive appraisal of specific situations in relation to
one’s goals and concerns, distinctive physiological reactions, action tendencies, and subjective
experience including affect (Frijda, 1986). Emotions typically begin with appraisals or evaluations of events along such dimensions as causation (i.e., “is the event caused by other people or
circumstances?”) or degree of control (i.e., “how much control do I have over the situation?”)
(Lazarus, 1991). For example, events appraised as unpleasant and harmful to self and over which
one feels having little control cause anxiety or fear (Roseman, 1991). Emotions are important to
study in a firm creation context because they serve as motivators of behaviour as well as have
important social functions, such as informing others of one’s internal states and intentions, evoking responses in others, and providing incentives for others (Keltner et al., 2003).
Emerging research on emotion regulation that explores the links between emotion regulation and organizational outcomes has remained largely theoretical, and this research has focused
very little on matters of concern to strategic management or entrepreneurship. What we know is

8

<-----Page 9----->that individuals differ in their ability to regulate their emotions, some choosing more successful
strategies than others, which allow them to attain desired emotional states and outcomes that are
beneficial to their social adaptation and long term well being (Mayer and Salovey, 1997). Emotion regulation represents a key attribute of emotional intelligence (Gross and John, 2003; Salovey et al., 2003). Research has shown the ways in which people regulate their emotions have
both intrapersonal (e.g., subjective well-being and stress) and interpersonal effects (pro-social
behaviour and closer social relationships with others) (e.g., Côté, 2005; Eisenberg, 2000; Lopes,
et al., 2005). Intrapersonal effects could be associated with resource creation from self (founder),
whereas interpersonal effects could facilitate resource creation from others (venture stakeholders
other than founders). But this literature has empirically investigated mainly mundane social interpersonal contexts (e.g., students in schools) and has not specifically explored a rich variety of
emotion regulation actions that are related to the complex context of building new organizations.
As a result, we do not know empirically the specific emotion regulation actions that can help or
hurt founders’ success in creating resources from themselves or from other people.
To the best of our knowledge, empirical research has under-explored 1) the variey of actions that founders perform to regulate their diverse positive and negative emotions, which are
elicited by the challenging process of building new firms, and 2) how and why differences in
emotion regulation influence founders’ success in creating a variety of resources that are necessary to build new firms. This is what we propose to do with our longitudinal field research.
We note, moreover, that founders’ emotion regulation can also involve influencing other people’s
emotions. However, this form of regulation could entail a variety of different actions and social
interaction mechanisms the treatment of which exceeds the scope and space of a single paper.
METHODS
Sample Selection and Data Collection

9

<-----Page 10----->Formulating precise hypotheses about the extent to which founders perform emotion
regulation (ER), the kinds of ER they practice, and associated outcomes seemed premature. We
conducted, therefore, a longitudinal and inductive theory-building field study of several nascent
companies based in the UK, following a case comparison methodology that has been elaborated
by qualitative research scholars including Eisenhardt and Graebner (2007).
To identify entrepreneurs who had recently launched new firms or were in the process of
creating them, we searched a UK business school’s database of alumni who had become involved
in entrepreneurial ventures after graduation. The resulting list contained 230 people, whom we
contacted by e-mail to explain the purpose of our research. We asked for entrepreneurs who (1)
had launched a company within the past 18 months or were planning to do so in the next six
months; (2) had their headquarters in the Greater London area; and (3) were willing to participate
in a research project that might involve a substantial time commitment. An initial screening process of the ventures that displayed receptivity to our research requests produced 26 ventures.
We recorded entrepreneurial behavior (in real time and retrospectively) mainly by interviewing the founders. Most had graduated from the same top-tier business school, had high
GMAT test scores (around 700), had an average of about five years of professional experience
before enrolling in the MBA program, and could access the school’s vast and high-powered
alumni network. Beginning in February 2002, we conducted face-to-face interviews, mostly at
work sites, with all 26 entrepreneurs. We established a personal rapport with them individually.
Each interview in the first round lasted between one and two hours. The second round of interviews took place between October and December 2002, the third in October–November 2003, the
fourth in January–February 2005, and the fifth in June-July 2009. We asked open-ended questions
and prompted respondents to provide concrete examples. Typical questions on emotion regulation
were: Can you tell us about some emotionally high and low moments in the last period? How did

10

<-----Page 11----->you deal with them? What consequences, if any, did this have on your own thinking and actions,
and those of people you interacted with?
On the basis of the data analysis discussed below, we identified six cases that featured
noticeably high and low levels of emotion regulation (ER). We decided to look more closely at
various ER behaviors and how they influenced organization-level outcomes. We thus followed
Eisenhardt’s (1989: 537) recommendation for a theoretical sampling approach that involves between four and ten cases in which the phenomenon of interest is “transparently observable”. Using a finite number of cases enables qualitative researchers to find a balance between generating a
reasonably textured theory and having to cope with large amounts of data (Brown and Eisenhardt,
1997; Huy, 2002). Table 1 presents short descriptions of these six focal cases (names of the companies and respondents are disguised to ensure confidentiality).
[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]
Data Analysis
We used the case-replication method, in which cases serve as independent experiments
that either confirm or reject emerging insights (Eisenhardt, 1989). We analyzed our data in three
broad steps. First, we noticed the prevalence of emotional experiences in the context of building
new companies. This first analytical step helped us focus our attention on the initial six extreme
cases described in Table 1 with noticeably rich or terse accounts of emotions. Second, we examined more closely accounts by the founders of these six ventures and coded those passages in
which they clearly expressed emotions that they had experienced in themselves or witnessed in
others. Next, we focused on those passages that clearly involved efforts to regulate (i.e., elicit or
modify) the founders’ own emotions. We examined in more detail various ER behaviors and
grouped them into various ER categories. In doing so, we made an effort to anchor these categories in our data (and not in any pre-conceived notions of possible ER behaviors), and to create

11

<-----Page 12----->categories that were exhaustive and conceptually distinct. Third, we identified potential outcomes
of these diverse ER behaviors that were relevant at the firm level. This sparked our insight that
ER of founders could be associated with resource creation for young firms (and not just with the
personal emotional well-being of the founder), and that differential use of ER could be associated
with differential resource creation, in other words, with the emergence of heterogeneous resources. As already mentioned, we coded and labeled ER action categories and outcomes closely
to the meaning of the data. In this way we were finally able to discern eight categories of ER, and
various entrepreneurial outcomes linked to ER, which we present below.
FINDINGS ON EMOTION REGULATION AND RESOURCE CREATION
The founders we studied differed both in terms of what ER actions they enacted (ER action types) and how they performed them (ER action modes). For example, some of them paid
increasing attention to the needs, perspectives and preferences of other firm stakeholders when
regulating their own emotions (e.g., by taking other people’s feedback into account while emotionally dealing with a commercial setback). Our research revealed, moreover, that these individual-level behaviors were often (though not always) associated with important firm-level outcomes,
which we conceptualize as resource creation for the venture. We also discovered that our key
findings cluster around distinct tensions for firm founders. A tension refers to people’s experiencing or dealing with two seeming opposing constructs like self versus other, or economic versus
emotional reward, or present versus future. Dealing with tensions can elicit emotions such as
anxiety, frustration, or even excitement. We found that founders in our study regulated their own
emotions to deal with the tensions that they experienced during the organization-building process:
(1) Consideration of self- versus others, (2) economic versus emotional rewards, and (3) shortterm versus long-term focus. We organize the presentation of our findings around these tensions.
Self Versus Others: Self- And Other-Orientation In Emotion Regulation (ER)

12

<-----Page 13----->How do founders at any given point in time balance their own needs, perceptions, preferences, and desires with those of other people involved in the business-building process? All of the
founders we studied performed some form of ER. We found an interesting pattern in our data,
however, concerning the ways in which founders performed ER actions (i.e., how they performed
these actions), to which we refer as ER action modes. Specifically, our data suggest that some
founders enacted more other-oriented emotion regulation over time. This means that in regulating
their own emotions they paid increasing attention to the needs, goals, and feelings (e.g., desires)
of other people they interacted with in juxtaposition to their own. Put differently, they integrated
others’ needs and feelings in performing their own emotion regulation (Agarwal et al, 2007). Listen, for example, to how Kathy described her way of dealing with an acute cash crisis:
It’s very, very tough [to deal with cash crises]. It’s like chicken. You don’t blink. You
keep driving. And it’s very tempting not to, and if I don’t, everybody else will kind of sit
down and get depressed. You just drive, drive, drive, drive very hard and push more to
continue to get the business to develop. Personally it’s quite grueling. (Founder, DRINK)
Kathy dealt with the extreme shortage of cash and the impending bankruptcy of her
young business – a potentially “depressing” situation – by mobilizing all her energy (“drive, drive,
drive”) and professional effort in order to deal with the business problem in a constructive way
(“continue to get the business to develop”). Kathy did not allow herself to be paralyzed by anxiety
or depression. Her stamina, discipline, and will-power could be considered remarkable in and of
themselves. But what is noteworthy here is that in dealing with her own intense emotions (depression, pain,fear) caused by the difficult economic situation, Kathy anticipated other people’s emotions (“everyone else…will get depressed”). Kathy’s emotion regulation actions ensured, amongst
other things, that others would not feel depressed by the economic crisis, and that the young firm
would acquire adequate economic resources to ensure the well-being of its members.
As this example shows, we coded emotion regulation actions as “other-oriented” when
founders explicitly referred to others when they described their own emotion regulation actions.

13

<-----Page 14----->We also coded emotion regulation actions as “other-oriented” when the founders told us they had
listened to other people’s feedback as part of their own emotion regulation response. For example,
when CONSULT experienced a period of slow growth, the founder of the company, Sam, listened carefully to his investors, which helped him temper his frustration.
I think [the slow growth] is a bit frustrating. But then I also have a reality check. I do
talk to investors, for example, and say things like how do you think we’re doing? Most of
them say you know, [Sam,] I know you’re a bit disappointed with how it’s going, but
I’m glad you’re still there, and boy, you should see some of my other investments—and
that makes me feel good again. So I just remind myself that we are all ambitious people,
we want this thing to grow really quickly, but we’ve got to be sensible about it. There’s
no point forcing growth for growth’s sake. (Founder, CONSULT)
As a result of his proactive advice seeking and integrating other people’s perspectives in
his own emotion regulation, Sam not only managed to reduce his frustration and disappointment.
It also helped him increase his patience with the venture-building process, and focus on achieving
long-term prosperity. This represented an important benefit for the young firm compared with
ventures in which discouraged or frustrated founders lost interest, got distracted with other things,
or reduced their contribution to the firm in terms of their time and effort.
Our analysis of founders’ self- versus other-oriented emotion regulation behaviors is
summarized in Table 2. The table displays time trends in the use of self- and other-oriented ER.
[INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Table 2 shows that the founders of DRINK and CONSULT, in particular, shifted to
other-orientation in emotion regulation relatively early in the development of their firms. The
downward sloping arrows (from “self” to “other”) in Table 2 for the two ventures from the first to
the second interview indicate these early trends. As for BUDGET, although it seems like a case in
which self-oriented emotion regulation actions dominated across all four interviews, the proportion of self- versus other-oriented ER actions declined consistently (from 8:2 to 3:1 to 3:2 to 2:2).
More informative perhaps, the qualitative evidence suggests that the founder of BUDGET under-

14

<-----Page 15----->went a process of shifting from self- to other-orientation, triggered by the acquisition of a number
of hotels with a large number of staff. This exogenous shock could have easily derailed the fledging young organization. The founder’s overall behaviors (not just his ER actions) show that at this
very juncture he made a transition toward other-orientation. For example, together with his business partner, he began to meet regularly with the general managers of the acquired hotels, and
showed concern for their personal well-being, not just their own firm’s business performance.
Within INCUBATE and TECH, we found that self-oriented ER of the founder dominated
other-oriented ER, particularly in the later stages of venture development, when the founders
were confronted with continued business-building challenges. We depict this focus on selforientation through an upward pointing arrow. (Note that this arrow does not suggest a transition
from other- to self-oriented ER, because the qualitative evidence in these cases does not allow us
to conclude that the founders of INCUBATE and TECH were originally other-oriented.) As for
INVEST, there were simply too few discernible ER actions to infer a dynamic pattern.
Firm-Level Benefits Of Other-Oriented ER: Resource Creation From Others
Our data suggest that as a direct result of the founders’ ER actions, other venture stakeholders could provide, through their discretionary acts, emotional, cognitive, and material support
to the venture, individually or collectively. Such support might include the direct provision of
financial capital (e.g., equity from investors or revenues from customers), or of human capital
(e.g., skilled employees joining the venture), or it might simply involve increasing the likelihood
that the venture will eventually receive these vital resources. For example, when a prospective
investor, according to the founder of DRINK, “was desperately keen to be involved” following
the founders’ ER behavior, we considered this increased willingness to support the venture as
“resource creation from others” even though the investor had not yet signed a formal contract (nor
had the entrepreneur accepted his investment.)

15

<-----Page 16----->In Table 3 we present our grounded definition of resource creation from others as well as
further supporting quotes, which are excerpts from interview passages in which they could be
clearly identified as outcomes of founders’ ER actions.
[INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]
Economic Versus Emotional Rewards: ER Actions Affecting Founders’ Emotional Rewards
Besides the mode (“how”) of ER, we also analyzed the types of (“what”) ER actions
founders enacted. As described in the Methods section, we distilled eight ER action categories (or
types) from our data, which are all listed in Table 4. We discovered that three of these action
types – which we call “emotional expanding,” “emphasizing emotional benefits,” and “eliciting
pleasant emotions in venture building” – cluster around the nature of rewards (emotional versus
economic) the founders get from their venturing activity. Specifically, these three types of ER
actions are associated with highlighting founders’ emotional rewards.
To illustrate the notion of emotional rewards, consider how Steve, the founder of CONSULT, commented on what it was like to build and operate a new firm:
I absolutely love it. I enjoy running a company, I enjoy making the decisions. I enjoy
having the opportunity to be entrepreneurial when I want to be entrepreneurial, so if I
have a good idea or my business partner has a good idea, we can sit down, we can have a
coffee and in ten minutes we can decide we’re going to spend some money and try something else. In a big company, that would take a year. So I love that. I like the variety. I
like being operations one day, I like being sales the next, I like doing some marketing the
following day. I like to be able to choose my own hours. (Founder CONSULT)
This emphasis on emotional rewards can be contrasted with a focus on economic payoffs
from venturing. For example, the main reason why Luke, the founder of INCUBATE, was engaged in business-building was the prospect of becoming personally wealthy. He explained:
At a long-term level, you are hoping to build value…if you multiply probability by best
outcome, versus multiplying probabilities by average outcomes, there’s more of a chance
to really make it big being an entrepreneur than being in professional services. (Founder
INCUBATE)

16

<-----Page 17----->Founders need to balance the goal of creating economic wealth with the need for socioemotional payoffs from the firm-building experience. This may not always be easy and produces
internal tensions, for example, when things are not going well for the venture and an increase in
business performance can only be potentially obtained at the cost of sustained personal hardship
and suffering (e.g., through long hours spent at work). The reverse could also happen, that is, an
increase in personal well-being (e.g., through taking more time off from work) could negatively
affect business performance. The three types of ER behaviors mentioned in this section not only
help the founders regulate their own emotions during business-building, but they also influence
the founders’ subjective balance between emotional and economic rewards. Jeremy, the founder
of BUDGET, a former venture capitalist and an exceptionally strong analytical thinker, described
his own psychological balance as follows:
Let’s be honest. If I was going to make no money out of it, I wouldn’t do it. One of the
prime motivations in setting up a business to me is to make enough money that you end
up financially secure. I’d love to repeat this exercise, because I think it’s a fantastically
exciting performance. But the other driver is actually being able to create something, being able to say, see that hotel there? That’s our hotel. We built it, we run it. This is our
business. (Founder BUDGET)
Because of space constraints, we describe the three types of ER actions that influence
founders’ emotional rewards in Table 4.
[INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]
Firm-level benefits: Resource creation from self (founder discretionary support).
Thanks to the type of ER action described above (i.e., ER actions influencing the nature of founders’ rewards), founders provide their firms with strong support and effort that facilitate venture
development. Such founder support can involve making available their own psychological resources – e.g., energy – for the venture (e.g. “I gave the venture development one hundred per
cent of my energy”). It can include devoting their cognitive resources – e.g., decision-making
skills and sustained attention– to address challenges regarding the development of the venture

17

<-----Page 18----->(e.g., “I left [my former employer] and focused on building a business”). We call this dimension
of resource creation from founders “discretionary support,” to convey that the founder made additional effort for the venture over and above what s/he would have normally done. For example,
making sales calls to prospective clients gave Sam, the founder of CONSULT, excitement. As a
result, he performed this vital activity for the venture with dedication and motivation:
For me sales were completely new. It gave me the adrenalin buzz that I got originally
from starting the company, having never done this…Once you get up, you have to get a
completely different mindset on, just saying right, I’m going to make twelve sales calls
this morning and that’s it… I have three cups of coffee, wait until I’m sitting there buzzing with caffeine, and then I just go for it. So that was what was getting me out of bed…I
knew I was the best person to give it a go. (Founder CONSULT)
Obviously, Sam received emotional benefits from engaging in sales activity, and this
should also help building business for the young firm. Randy, an investor in CONSULT, confirmed this in a separate interview: “Sam enjoys working for himself. He gets a lot of satisfaction
from it.” The founder’s joy helped the young firm because this emotion increased the founder’s
motivation and effort level, which are important resources for a new firm. Roman, another investor in CONSULT, validated in an independent interview the link between the founder’s ER and
the resulting resource creation for the firm as follows: “Sam cares about the business and he’s
working hard at the business; if you care about something you get emotionally intense about it,
but not in a confrontational way.”
Short Term Versus Long Term: ER Actions Affecting The Founders’ Temporal Focus
In terms of the types of (“what”) ER actions founders enacted, we inferred that the remaining five of the eight action types we identified – “reducing boredom,” “eliciting hope,”
“emotional toughening up,” “emotional channeling” and “tempering of extreme emotions” – cluster around how founders manage the psychological tension between short-term and long-term
requirements for the business. Founders needed to focus on current, short-term business challenges but at the same time not lose sight their future, long-term business-building objectives.

18

<-----Page 19----->Sam, the founder of CONSULT, described his long-term objectives as follows: “I want something
that’ll last. It’ll probably be bought up, it might change its name, it might do all sorts of things,
but to have something that could survive without me being there is quite important.” But shortterm considerations often risk undermining their long-term perspective, as Mathew, the founder
of INVEST, shared with us: “From time to time, we [co-founders] talk to each other and we say,
what do we do if this thing doesn’t work? And you know, there’s all sorts of ideas.”
The psychological tension between short- and long-term considerations is perhaps most
salient during periods of stagnation or decline in business performance, or just before an expected
yet highly uncertain growth spurt, when the founder needed most to ensure the short-term survival of the business, but at the same time feel the urge to “abandon the sinking ship” or personal
hardship in “keeping the ship afloat.” Christine, the founder of DRINK, illustrated her hardship:
The products are just flying. We’ve got these rewards, and the importers are really starting to listen. It’s just starting to get a head of steam in it. I’m spread very thinly. Emotionally, how do I cope? That’s a really good question. I live in hope, I know how to fight
fires and I know how to get things in very fast…. Yes, I live in hope, but it’s getting
really very dicey now personally. I mean, I’m just pulling it back, but it’s just too far. It’s
gone way too far on the personal finance side. I don’t have a credit card I can use. All of
that’s gone. (Founder DRINK)
The ER actions mentioned in this section not only helped the founders regulate their own
emotions during business-building, but they also influenced their temporal foci (e.g., short-term
versus long-term, present versus future, slow versus rapid progress, etc.). Again, because of space
constraints, we describe these five types of ER actions in Table 4.
Firm-level benefits: Resource creation from self (founder’s persistence). Our data
show that thanks to the type of emotion regulation actions described above (namely, ER actions
influencing the founders’ temporal focus), founders persevered with their venture development
even under adversity (e.g., “despite the difficulties I continued with the venture”). For example,
when we asked James, the founder of BUDGET, how he coped with stress and with the prospect

19

<-----Page 20----->of failure and total loss of his investment in the venture, he explained to us:
Of course I worry about it, of course I think about it and of course I’m impatient because I want it to move forward much more quickly. But at the same time I’ve got to be
realistic about it, because otherwise I would just end up being totally stressed all the time.
I find exercise very helpful. I go to the gym. If there is any pent-up frustration, if I’ve
had a bad day, because you live by the day, then that’s a good way of getting rid of it.
(Founder BUDGET)
Reducing negative emotions through physical exercise helped the founder get his mind
off depressing concerns about the current state of venture development (specifically, progress he
deemed too slow). This type of ER action renewed the founder’s patience and helped him refocus
on his longer-term business building goals, beyond the specific challenges of the day. Ruth, the
HR director of BUDGET, confirmed in a separate interview that with James, “there was quite a
bit of impatience there.” But she also noted his eagerness to reduce his negative emotions and
avoid them from spilling over other firm members: “The founders contain tensions between the
three of them and work out their problems. They have their argument and then they come out
with a solution, rather than it be shared amongst other people.” Fred, the firm’s chairman of the
board, also noted: “Well, obviously the emotions, they usually keep them pretty well in check,
certainly when I’m there.”
In a related vein, some founders stayed focused on their long-term objectives with their
ventures despite alternative employment opportunities, and/or they extended their personal time
horizon with the venture (i.e., they prolonged the length of time they had originally planned to
dedicate fully to the venture until their envisioned exit from the business). Accordingly, we call
this facet of resource creation from the founders “persistence.” Founder’s persistence is a valuable resource for a young organization, because the nascent firm is typically vulnerable and dependent on the stewardship from a few dedicated individuals. The founders play a key role in acquiring resources and rallying support for the venture.
Towards An Emerging Model Of Emotion Regulation And Resource Creation

20

<-----Page 21----->In Table 5 we show the extent to which the founders reported to us their use of various
types of ER actions. The table shows that Sam (CONSULT) and Kathy (DRINK) clearly stand
out as founders who displayed the greatest variety of emotion regulation actions, drawing, respectively, on eight and seven (out of eight) types, some of them quite heavily. Two other founders,
Lars (INCUBATE) and Morten (INVEST), stand out on the other end of the spectrum as those
who displayed the lowest variety of emotion regulation actions in our study. They enacted only
four and two types of emotion regulation, respectively, and they performed these types very
sparsely. The two remaining founders, Jim (BUDGET) and Phil (TECH), enacted six and five ER
categories, respectively. These two latter cases can be further distinguished through their degree
of other-orientation in performing their emotion regulation actions..
[INSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE]
Since ER actions can produce important resource creation benefits for the ventures, variation in founders’ enactment of ER actions matters at the firm-level. This is an important finding,
because the link between founders’ variety of self-emotion regulation actions and resource creation (both from founders and other firm stakeholders) for new firms has previously not been
shown empirically. Based on data from these other stakeholders exclusively, in Table 6 we describe, in aggregated form, the levels of resources created—from self (founders) and other stakeholders—for the firms in our sample. Juxtaposed with the data presented earlier in this study on
the modes (Table 2) and types (Table 5) of ER actions used by the founders of these various firms,
Table 6 lends support to our argument that founders’ ER can be construed as a plausible and potentially important explanation of how heterogeneous resource positions in firms come about.
Ventures in which founders used a variety of emotion regulation actions (Table 5) and were
other-oriented (Table 2) generally benefited from high levels of resource creation (Table 6).
[INSERT TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE]

21

<-----Page 22----->As a whole, the findings suggest an emerging empirically grounded model linking founder’s ER action types, their ER action mode (i.e., the degree of other- or self-orientation), and
resource creation for their ventures (see Figure 1).
[INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]
The model depicted in Figure 1 shows that ER actions performed by founders can create
resources for their ventures – from the founders themselves, or from other stakeholders. This
positive relationship between ER action types and firm-level outcomes is moderated by the founders’ “other- or self-orientation” in ER (i.e., by the adopted ER action mode). Specifically, we
suggest, based on our data, that self-orientation has a negative moderating impact. Phil, the founder of TECH, for example, paid attention to his own emotions, which he frequently regulated using various ER actions (see Table 5). But Phil performed these behaviors in a largely self-oriented
fashion, failing to take into account the perspectives of other stakeholders. Destruction rather than
creation of resources from others was the result: Phil lost the support of his senior management
team, and of other important stakeholders such as members of the board of directors. In fact, he
lost the company he founded as he was ultimately dismissed by the board after fighting a long and
hard battle to keep his position; the firm assets were eventually sold off. This suggests a positive
moderating effect of other-orientation (or, a negative moderating effect of self-orientation) on the
relationship between ER actions and resource creation from others (see Figure 1).
The example of Phil and TECH also highlights another noteworthy nuance to our model,
in that the founder’s persistence may not always represent a benefit for the firm. As in the case of
TECH, if persistence is the result of a predominantly self-oriented ER by the founder, such persistence might harm the firm’s development. Persistence could, for example, prevent the young firm
from evolving beyond a self-oriented founder who has lost the support of other firm members.
Founder’s persistence could become “dogged,” self-serving, and dysfunctional for the firm. In our

22

<-----Page 23----->model, we show a negative moderating effect of founder’s self-oriented emotion regulation on the
positive relationship between emotion regulation and resource creation from self (specifically,
persistence). Although the hypothesized moderating effect would not reduce the strength of the
founder’s persistence, it would affect its usefulness, or more precisely its contribution to the
young firm’s development. The dotted line in Figure 1 denotes this effect. It is dotted, (1) because
it relates only to founder persistence as an outcome and not to services from self in general (we
did not find empirical evidence that suggest self-oriented emotion regulation would affect the
founder’s discretionary support), and (2) because it refers to the usefulness of the founder’s persistence for the firm (and not to the strength of persistence displayed by the founder).
Overall, our findings suggest that ER can be beneficial under certain circumstances, but
they do not imply that more ER of the founder (in a quantitative sense) is necessarily better for
the venture. Drawing on a broad repertoire of actions to address specific contextual conditions is
more adaptive than frequently performing a narrow set of self-oriented ER actions.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
A core tenet of resource-based strategy is that firms’ resources are heterogeneous (Amit
and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991, 1997; Peteraf, 1993; Peteraf and Barney, 2003). But what
are the origins of resource heterogeneity? Where does it come from? What are the contributing
factors and mechanisms that can explain its emergence? In this article, we have begun to reveal
the micro-foundations of firms’ resource-based strategy, focusing on affect-related behaviors of
firm founders. Our findings yield fine-grained insights into the micro psychological processes that
shape differences in young firms’ resources. The findings suggest that the emergence of resource
heterogeneity can have “affective roots,” that is, it can be explained by the ways in which founders deal with their affective states during the venture-building process. Obviously, we do not
suggest that emotion regulation is the only mechanism to generate heterogeneous resources, but it

23

<-----Page 24----->is one enabler that has been largely overlooked by strategy and entrepreneurship scholars.
Why Does Emotion Regulation Help Create Resources For Ventures?
Why is ER useful in an organization building context? In analyzing our data and asking
why these emotion regulation modes and types, and not others, we inferred three subsets of ER
actions, each related to a distinct that firm founders grappled with: (1) Consideration of self- versus others, (2) economic versus emotional rewards, and (3) short-term versus long-term focus.
Table 7 shows how we assigned theoretically various emotion regulation actions (i.e., modes and
types) to each tension, and what the main associated firm-level benefits are. We also indicate—
tentatively—which phases of venture development each of the tension might be most salient,
which will require distinct ER actions.
INSERT TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE]
Emotional Reconciling And Resource-based Theory
Since resource-based theory takes resource heterogeneity as a starting point in its chain of
logic aimed at explaining differential intra-industry firm performance, and our model shows resource heterogeneity as an output, our research provides an opportunity for embedding our proposed model of founders’ emotion regulation actions (see Figure 1) in a broader resource-based
framework. Our affect-based theory on the origins of resource heterogeneity could form the
“front-end” of a more developed resource based theory (RBT), and advance RBT by mitigating
some of the key concerns that have been leveled against it (e.g., Priem and Butler, 2001). To accomplish this, we build on and extend the resource-based framework developed by Peteraf and
Barney (2003). Figure 2 shows a tentative integration of our model within that framework.
[INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]
Focusing on the organization-building context, we propose to complement this framework by considering the notion of resource creation. Resources that are endogenously created

24

<-----Page 25----->during organization-building could potentially affect the costs and perceived benefits of the firm’s
products and services (e.g., the financial capital received from an investor could be invested into
R&D to improve product quality, or into marketing to improve service quality), but they do not
automatically lead to the creation of economic value (e.g., the firm may be developing the wrong
type of products for its chosen market segment). The extended framework shown in Figure 2,
therefore, complements and enhances classic resource-based theory in several respects. First, it
mitigates the concern about potential tautology (see Priem and Butler, 2001:28) by conceptualizing founders’ emotion regulation actions (specifically, emotional reconciling), resource characteristics (e.g., discretionary support and persistence from founders) and outcomes (economic value)
independently, so that any analytic statement relating these concepts to each other will not be true
by definition. Emotion regulation, and more specifically emotional reconciling, could help explain the creation of resources with desirable properties (see Barney 1997), such as firm specificity (e.g., related to the founder’s persistence with “her/his baby”), social complexity or causal
ambiguity (e.g., committed, collective support provided by employees or members of the top
management team to a specific firm as a result of emotional benefits experienced in co-creating a
specific nascent firm). Put differently, expectations and luck (Barney, 1986) or accumulation over
time (Dierickx and Cool, 1989) may not be the only mechanisms that can help managers recognize and realize the value of key resources. ER provides another way to create these resources.
Second, in traditional resource-based theory the value of resources is determined on the
demand side, which is implicitly assumed, and remains external to the theory (see Priem and Butler, 2001: 29-30). Here, we do not need to make these simplifying assumptions. Our theory is
more about enhancing the productivity of existing resources (founder, other stakeholders) that are
critical to the success of any young firm, rather than identifying a distinct set of valuable and

25

<-----Page 26----->unique resources. Put differently, our theory internalizes the mechanisms that can render existing
resources valuable and unique for each firm.
Third, our theory is operationally valid, in the sense that is “practicable for managers to
manipulate the key independent variables” (Priem and Butler, 2001: 31). This is because our theory of emotion regulation is anchored in observable managerial behaviors. There is no a priori
reason why a manager should not be able to engage in these behaviors. Our theory is a theory of
action and it is actionable.
Summary Of Contributions And Future Research
Our study contributes to resource-based theory by offering a new, previously underexplored explanation of why firms can have heterogeneous resources, namely due to founders’
emotion regulation behaviors (see Figure 1). By delineating the endogenous, affect-based drivers
of resource heterogeneity, we address an empirical gap in the strategy literature, which has hitherto focused on exogenous, cognition-based factors (e.g., Nelson, 1991; Peteraf and Barney,
2003; Williams, 1994). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to develop the affective roots of resource-based theory. Our empirically grounded model, moreover, can be used to
extend resource-based theory (see Figure 2), which yields several important theoretical advances.
These theoretical advances could also help improve future empirical investigations of resourcebased theory, which to date have largely relied on quantifying the amounts of certain resources
controlled by a firm (understood as resource heterogeneity) and correlating them to measures of
firm performance. Newbert (2007: 131) found that only “an overwhelming minority of resources
examined (only 10 of 26, or 38%) have received empirical support.” Our research suggests that it
may well be worth considering how (and not just which or how many) resources are engaged to
produce differential services for a firm. That is, our research ties into recent developments to explain superior resource management by suggesting relevant affect-related management actions

26

<-----Page 27----->(e.g., see Holcomb, Holmes and Connelly, 2009; Sirmon, Hitt and Ireland, 2007).
We also contribute to the emotions in organizations literature by advancing the concept of
emotional reconciling, which represents a set of ER actions that allow firm founders to deal with
the tensions often found in the context of organization building. Research on emotion regulation
has seldom explored how top managers deal with tensions in complex contexts such as building
new firms. We extend the ER literature with a contextualized, novel, and fine-grained concept.
This study also raises a number of intriguing questions that could be investigated in future empirical or theoretical research. For example, why do founders and managers differ in their
propensity to use emotion regulation behaviors? Under what circumstances does ER convey a
sustainable competitive advantage to firms? What other affect-based mechanisms foster the creation of heterogeneous resources? How generalizable are the findings from this study across young
firms (e.g., in a larger sample), across cultures (e.g., in countries other than the UK), and across
firm types (e.g., in more established firms)? And how do founders’ emotions, emotion regulation
actions, and the process of firm formation co-evolve over time? Longitudinal, process research
may be needed to shed further light on some of these issues.
To conclude, our study identifies emotion regulation, and in particular emotional reconciling, as important mechanisms contributing to the creation of heterogeneous resources in entrepreneurial ventures. Our study provides insight into the origins of firms’ resource-based strategy
by linking founders’ affect-related behaviors to resource creation at the firm level. We hope that
this research will spark more work on the micro-foundations of strategy to enhance our understanding of how firm founders and managers come to create differentiated resource positions and
thereby lay the foundations for value creation and future rents.

Table entries:
Number of reported self-oriented (“self”) and other-oriented (“other”) ER actions by venture and
by interview, focusing on the early business-building phase (first four interviews). E.g., “8” in the
upper left-hand cell of the table denotes that we found eight codes for self-oriented ER actions in
the first interview with the DRINK founder.
Note: The arrows in this table depict a possible shift from self- to other-orientation in emotion
regulation (for DRINK, CONSULT, and BUDGET) as indicated by a greater ratio of otheroriented ER vs. self-oriented ER; or a possible emphasis on self-orientation in emotion regulation
(for INCUBATE, and TECH) as indicated by an increasing ratio of self-oriented ER vs. otheroriented ER

Illustrative Quotations2

Receiving emotional, cognitive, and
material support for the new venture
from other people, or increasing the
likelihood of receiving such support
from others, for example, through
building trust and loyalty with them
(e.g., between the founder and other
TMT members).

“So [the VCs…are] hungry for us.” (Founder, DRINK)
“I refused to take no for an answer. Managed to get them back to the table, and eventually they put the money in.” (Founder, TECH)
“Our clients are really paying us money to do stuff.” (Founder, CONSULT)
“As a team it made us very close.” (Founder, DRINK)
“That gives some stability to the team” (Founder, DRINK)
“We trust each other and we find each other’s opinions very useful” (Founder CONSULT)

Working hard to ensure successful
venture development: Making available own emotional resources – energy and effort – for the venture.
Making available own cognitive (including decision-making) resources
to resolve important issues regarding
the development of the venture.

“You’ve got to give it one hundred percent.” (Founder, BUDGET)
“I got a new lease of energy…I probably for the next two weeks worked a hundred hours
a week, making just maybe a hundred phone calls a day, very intensely. We just worked
like dogs. I worked like a dog” (Founder, TECH)
“I’m constantly going, ‘Okay, what am I going to do, what am I going to do, what am I
going to do?’ You don’t sit there and despair. It’s constant - solution, solution, solution.”
(Founder, DRINK)
“We’ll get [a solution] that will be much more valuable and much more thoughtthrough” (Founder, INCUBATE)

Staying with a chosen course of action regarding the venture development, even if it is personally difficult.
Staying with the venture even though
there are difficulties. Extending one’s
personal time horizon with the venture.

“You keep pushing on” (Founder, BUDGET)
“Once you’ve been through a few [ups and downs with your venture]…you get on with
it, really.” (Founder, INCUBATE)
“So why would I not, you know, continue the artistry?” (Founder, DRINK)
“I want to continue” (Founder, INVEST)
“When we started off, it was three to four years, but then of course reality hit and we
realized that it doesn’t work that quickly. So I think it will be, at the end of the day,
about a ten year plan” (Founder, CONSULT)

These quotes are excerpts from coded passages of our data where they could be identified as consequences of founders’ emotion regulation actions.

with building the venture. For example, adding concern for
the welfare of employees and their families to the desire of
creating personal wealth.
Emphasizing emotional rewards (e.g., fun) from businessbuilding more heavily than immediate economic rewards,
or other rewards or disadvantages. This may involve comparing emotional rewards from business-building to benefits and/or drawbacks the founder would have had from a
hypothetical alternative (e.g., working as an employee for a
corporation).
Performing actions during venture building that elicit emotions such as fun, excitement, enthusiasm, or joy. These
actions are aligned with the entrepreneur’s personal interest
and motivation, and are often conducted without expectation of any external reward.

Illustrative Quotations from Founders3
“As you develop the business there are other things that
become important as well besides the financial opportunity… you now employ [a large number of] people, so you
have a responsibility for those people, and you want them
to enjoy themselves, or at least be happy in work.”
(BUDGET)
“I like working for myself. I remember working for a big
company and I just didn’t like it. I mean, okay, you get a
nice salary and you can hide behind a big brand, but it
doesn’t do me anything.” (INVEST)
“I wouldn’t have been enjoying [working for a consulting
firm]. I don’t think financial salary is a reasonable measure
for me. I’m very happy with what I’m doing now.” (CONSULT)
“[Building a firm has] the spirit of adventure and exploration. I never know what’s going to happen, and it’s that
edgy feeling of what’s going to hit you, which is fun. Fun
is too shallow a word. It’s deeper than that—a sense of
flow, of being alive.” (DRINK)
“Building business is very exciting..” (INCUBATE)

“I’m a bit bored at the moment. I want the company to be
growing…That’s going to give me the biggest excitement
ever, when we’re recruiting heavily again and we’re building new parts of the organization and we’re winning work
to support that frequently. That’s really going to be for me

Definition

Telling oneself -- based partly on substantive evidence, but
more as a statement of unsupported optimism -- that the
future prospects of the venture will be better than its current
ones.
In a context where founders are faced with competing priorities, potential distractions from the business, or where
there is a risk of energy dispersion: making a deliberate,
effort to apply, concentrate, or focus emotional energy on
conducting activities that relate to building the organization
as opposed to, for example, entertainment, family, hobbies,
other jobs.
Reducing intensity of own existing negative emotions such
as fear, anger, frustration, depression; or reducing own existing positive emotions such as comfort, pride, and joy
regarding aspects of the venture development.

Illustrative Quotations from Founders3

again.” (CONSULT)
“I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I know
that when this business is successful it’s going to be worth a
decent amount of money.” (BUDGET)
“It’s like looking for the signs of spring…if there is external momentum being generated, I keep going.” (DRINK)
“I refused to give up. I got a new lease of energy in terms
of wanting to make something happen with the business.
For the next two weeks I worked a hundred hours a week,
making just maybe a hundred phone calls a day, very intensely, to try and find investors. I worked like a dog. I just
tried to save the business.” (TECH)
“We just need to be a bit more dispassionate, step backwards and ask questions objectively.” (BUDGET)

“I fluctuated between sort of a state of tiredness and complete alertness, but I went to the gym and I’m feeling renewed.” (TECH)
Dealing with adversarial circumstances (e.g., financiers who “We fear that people who invest in [funds like ours] will be

Differential Resource Creation And Emerging Resource Heterogeneity

Resource Creation From Self (Founder)
Discretionary support: Founder invests high personal energy and
effort into the venture.
“For Christine the venture was her life, it was her passion, and she
was very motivated, because it was what she wanted to do.” (Barbara,
former employee)

Persistence: Founder makes continued efforts, and does not let
up; nor consider any alternative jobs or activities.

Resource Creation From Others (Stakeholders)
Stakeholders show strong adherence and loyalty. Venture receives strong personal support from board members and employees. E.g., whole company participates in devising an interim
range of innovative drink products.
“There was an idea of a new [product]… Everyone wanted to be involved, everyone wanted to help. I mean everyone, really everyone,
even the nanny that worked for Christine.” (Barbara, former employee)

“For her, there’s no line between work and play; actually, work is
play.” (Theresa, senior executive)

High
Discretionary support: Founder constantly searches for new
business opportunities when the core market slumps.
“Sam will quite happily work weekends or work on a Sunday or whatever. He will put the effort in.” (Roman, investor)

Persistence: Founder shows continued high enthusiasm and
dedication to the business.
“[We want to] create something of value in terms of, you know, people
feel they belong, and something that, you know, something that persists” (Mathew, co-founder)

High
Discretionary support: Founder kicks into “high gear” with the
acquisition of a hotel chain.
“Taking on a lot of hotels all at once, they got lots of things to sort out,
so we didn’t see the directors very much.” (Sevin, general manager)

Persistence: Founder displays continuous, steady effort.

High
Stakeholders give strong discretionary support. E.g., consultants collectively search for new business opportunities. Stakeholders develop strong adherence and loyalty to new organization.
“We decided as senior managers to actually go out and get involved in
projects ourselves because we didn’t have very many employees and
we needed to bring revenue in.” (Lorenzo, employee)

High
Stakeholders give strong discretionary support (e.g., managers
volunteer to get personally involved with operation of new hotels). Very low turnover among employees.
“We’ve got a lot of very good employees, and we realize how hard
they work.” (Ruth, HR director)

“[James] is very committed.” (Ruth, HR director)

Resource Creation From Self (Founder)
Discretionary support: Founder invests himself thoroughly in
the business, but in a way that eventually alienates others.
“His drive was a key part of moving the company forward from the
beginning” (Daniel, BoD chairman)

Persistence: Founder holds on to his “baby” until fired.
“When he had to hand over more operational responsibilities [to the
newly hired CEO], he didn’t like that.” (Kevin, co-founder)

High (but with negative consequences for the company)
Discretionary support: When things do not go as planned, founder disconnects from the business.
“Everyday was a battle, because it was a very big challenge. That
brought him a lot of worries, which in a way I would say even affected his health:” (Susan, wife)

Persistence: Partly under pressure from his wife, returns to previous job.

Resource Creation From Others (Stakeholders)
With ongoing problems, stakeholder support weakens. Emerging rifts at board level, bitter personal disputes among TMT
members. Dismissal of CEO, personnel cuts.
“I work pretty serious hours and really try to make this work.”
(Stanislav, employee)

First High, Then Low
Weak support from stakeholders, except co-founders, whose
enthusiasm for the venture fades over time. Lack of external finance, low sales. Hidden tensions within TMT.
“We had the first major falling out at that point because Landis negotiated in a non-partner way.” (Kurtis, co-founder)
“[The employees] were like workers in a factory.” (Susan, wife)

“Landis is still living with his wife and kids. He’d rather have money
sooner…He was massively, massively under pressure from his wife”
(Kurtis, co-founder)

Low
Discretionary support: Founder displays a professional attitude,
expends measured (not extraordinary) effort.
“Michael likes to do a good job.” (Alex, BoD member)

Low
Political in-fighting, conflicts about strategy, pursuit of economic self-interest. TMT members mainly motivated by financial stake in business.

Persistence: Founder decides to stay with venture, but partly
motivated by lack of alternatives.

“Some became very bitter and angry about what was happening” (Nelson, former senior partner)

“When the business got into difficulties, [Michael] still stood by it.”
(Alex, BoD member)

“[The TMT members] would be falling out on some things and working together incredibly well on other things.” (Alex, BoD member)
