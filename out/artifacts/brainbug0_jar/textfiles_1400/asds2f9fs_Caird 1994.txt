Abstract
Research on innovators and the role which they play in product innovation offers useful
insights into the signi$cance of key ‘players’ in the innovation process for commercial outcomes.
The paper reports on research which explores the role of innovators who have received a British
government award (the SMART award) for innovation in small firms. The nature of this role
was explored by examining innovator competences, motives, risk taking behaviours and the
significance of the innovator’s role for commercial success.
The interview results support the argument that the innovator’s role in the small firm is
important for the commercial success of innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). Approximately 50% described the innovator’s role as very important for the commercial
success of the innovation. Approximately 50% thought that the innovator’s role was important
only at the initial stages of the innovation process, because either they lack the marketing skills
to take the project forward or their competences are irrelevant beyond the technical development
stages. As one participant pointed out, “once the concept is there and the inspiration is supplied
. . . the innovator is less important and the project needs lots of worker bees”.

Introduction

Many economists and politicians have accepted
innovation as a key condition for business performance, competitiveness and economic wealth [l].
However, there is a surprising lack of research
which treats innovators as a group worthy of
investigation. An innovator is defined here as the
key person with an idea to develop or improve a
product or process, with a view towards its
commercialization [2].
There has been some research on the biographical characteristics of the innovator, as a partial

Technovation

Vol. 14 No. 2

explanation of innovative behaviour [3]. Others
have discussed the importance of the innovator’s
role despite the movement towards a greater
formalization of the technological innovation process in the twentieth century [4]. However, there
is little study of the nature and role of the key
innovator in product innovation within small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This lack of
research could reflect views that innovators either
cannot or should not be treated as a ‘type’, or
that innovators are not significant in successful
innovative product development.
However, the
argument put forward in this paper is that research

on innovators, their role and significance for the
innovation process, offers insights to the innovative
product development process, problems experienced by innovators and the significance of the
key innovator for commercial outcomes.
It is important to clarify the concept of innovation
in order to understand the views presented by the
participants. During the interviews, it became clear
that innovation and invention were difficult to
define and often used as alternatives for each
other [2]. Apart from one participant, who always
wanted to be an inventor, all the participants
described themselves as innovators rather than
inventors.
For some, invention and innovation are distinct
processes and, for others, part of the same process.
However, most of the participants attempted to
distinguish between invention and innovation,
which led to the following definitions: invention
is an original, technical and patentable process
with no necessary commercial application; whereas
innovation usually involves the application of
something (new or in a new way) to solve
a problem, usually for commercial gain. The
participants recognized that innovation and invention may be separate processes, or a part of the
same process, because when an invention is
commercialized, it becomes part of an innovative
process. As the innovative work undertaken by
those interviewed involved both invention and
innovation, this accounts for the use of both
concepts in this study.
In order to explore the nature of the innovators’
role, 24 SMART (Small firms Merit Award for
Research and Technology) winners were interviewed in 1991. This represented a subset of 32
Scottish SMART award winners for 1989 and
1990. These interviews explored perceptions of
the innovation process and the innovator’s role in
product innovation, and have been the subject of
several reports [2, 51. This paper explores the
nature of innovator competences and motivations
and the role of key innovators in the commercial
success of innovative product development.

Background

to the study

The Small firms Merit Award for Research and
Technology (SMART) is a British competition
supported by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The SMART award is open to firms
with fewer than 50 employees, which are having
difficulty in attracting funding for innovation [6].
This scheme recognizes the failure of market forces
to support high-technology innovation as a result
of the potential risks of failure associated with
innovation. It aims to encourage the formation of
scientific and technological firms and help them
to grow to a point where they are likely to attract
financial support.
The 24 innovators, representing companies with
SMART awards, can be described as follows:
Nationality: 23 British, 1 Australian.
Age: 30-40 years, 12 participants;

40-50 years, 11 participants;
50+ years, 1 participant.
Gender: 23 male; 1 female.
Educational background: 23 had experience of
higher education; 1 had GCSE qualification
equivalent.
Status in the company: 18 owner managers; 5
managing directors; 1 technical manager.
Previous experience of innovation: all participants.
Projects: see Table 1.
Interviews were conducted with the collaboration
of the Scottish Office, Industry Department (the
DTI in Scotland). Structured interviewing was

employed in this investigation, using both telephone and face-to-face approaches. The SMART
winners were questioned about:
the competences of innovators (both their own
and those of innovators in general);
their motivation for technological innovation;
the technical and commercial project risks which
they undertook; and
the role and significance of their own role,
and the innovator’s role in general, for the
commercial success of innovative products.
Explorations of innovators’ competences, motivations and risk-taking behaviours provide a profile
of the innovator and the innovator’s role in SMEs.
The significance of the innovator’s role, as a
determinant of commercial success, needs to be
established in the context of an understanding of
innovators themselves.

3. What is the nature
competences?

of innovator

When SMART winners were asked “what sort
of a person makes a good innovator?“,
some
doubt was found that such a person exists. One
participant could not imagine the sort of person
who makes a good innovator. This participant
believed that ‘real innovators’ are few and far
between. But what is meant by a real innovator
and, if there is such a person, why are they few
and far between? One maintained that the nature
of the innovator is not important, providing they
have ‘the capability to realize their idea’. Though
23 participants commented on the characteristics
of the good innovator,
it was apparent that
they did not believe that there was one single
characteristic. The innovator is clearly complex
and may not be described by specific characteristics
or specific sets of characteristics. Only one believed
that the innovator was a particular sort of person.
Some participants commented on the so-called
‘nature versus nurture’ controversy, which refers
to the argument over whether genetic inheritance
or environmental conditions is more important for

Technovation

Vol. 14 No. 2

in SMEs?

explaining the nature and behaviour of people.
Although it is impossible to prove this argument
either way, since people always operate in an
environment of some kind, most people have an
attitude to this controversy. Three suggested that
the innovator is born to be innovative and that
innovative ability has something to do with one’s
genetic inheritance of abilities. Another view was
that there might be two types of innovator: the
first type has the genetic predisposition for the
abilities associated with innovation; and the second
type has developed the. ability or skill through
training on the job. However, the view that the
organizational
and educational environment
is
important for the development
of the ‘good
innovator’ was shared by five participants. As
one participant pointed out, it is difficult to be
innovative outside a supportive environment within
an organization: “A hot-house flower needs a hot
house!“.
Some of the participants believed that what is
important is that the innovator has the capability
to develop ideas commercially; this led to discussions of innovator competences. For example,
one was critical of the so-called ‘enterprise culture’
for undermining the need for rigorous competence
in innovation and for highlighting superficial skills
instead. These competences may be categorized
under the following headings: personal characteristics, mental ability, knowledge and experience,
technical competence, project management skills,
team skills and marketing skills. Table 2 shows

that SMART winners had various views on what
innovative characteristics might be generic and on
the competences which they personally possessed.
When considering their own competences, participants tended to highlight their technical competence and knowledge and experience; whereas,
when considering the qualities of the ‘good’
innovator, personality characteristics were most
often cited, albeit with little agreement about what
they were. Some of these results require further
clarification, as given below.

Motivated

Six mentioned the innovator’s motivation and
drive, describing the innovator as irritable, obsessive and passionate.

Personal characteristics

Of the 13 participants who mentioned the personal
characteristics of the good innovator, there was
some agreement about the personal characteristics
of innovators in general. It is possible to classify
some of the comments on the innovator’s personality characteristics as follows.
Courageous

Various comments about the courage of the
innovator were made by six participants, describing
the innovator as:
“not frightened of trying things”;
l “prepared
to look stupid”;
l “pretty bold”;
l “capable of taking knocks, i.e. a robust personality”;
0 “risk taker”;
l “having guts”.

“able to make things happen”;
“not too stupid to set ideas up to be shot down
in flames”;
“a generalist rather than a specialist”;
“flexible, not single minded”.

Two participants mentioned characteristics such
as determination, dedication and persistence.
Abililty

to relate

Three emphasized the importance of the innovator’s ability to get on well with people. For
example, one pointed out that “the innovator must
understand that other people are important . . .
the innovator may have trouble dealing with people
and this could have bad consequences for the
misfit innovator who won’t make it”.
Optimistic

Two described the innovator as optimistic and
enthusiastic, although one said that the “good
innovator” should “not be too extrovert”.
When participants were asked about the particular strengths and competences which they bring
themselves to the project, they highlighted some
of the above. There was some agreement that
persistence (by four) and obsessiveness (by two)
were personal
strengths.
For example,
one
described himself as “determined and willing to
fight hard and to complete things started”; another
as “patient and hard working”. However, only
one participant. described himself as:
l “having the ability to impart enthusiasm”;
0 “having humility”;
l “bloody minded”;
l “needing to believe that what you are doing is
essential”.

Mental

ability

Ten commented on the innovator’s ability. Three
pointed out that “you have got to have ideas and
to be able to put them forward for realization”.
Four emphasized that “you must be able to
find applications for ideas”. Three described the
innovator as a lateral or “way-out thinker”. Two
described the innovator as open-minded.
Two
commented on the innovator’s intelligence and
ability to think. One commented on the way the
“good innovator” thinks, believing that he or she
is guided by certain mental sets such as: “a concern
with challenging ignorance”; “looking for interlinkages and maps”; “being willing to say ‘I don’t
understand”‘; “perpetually asking ‘what if?“‘; and
“searching for the right question to ask”.
When participants commented on the strengths
and competences
which they brought to the
SMART project, ten commented on their own
ability, that is:
innovative ability (by five);
“the element of the artist as opposed to the
pure scientist” (by one);
“divergent thinking” or the “ability to think
laterally” (by two);
cleverness (by one);
good concentration powers (by two);
abstract thinking (by one);
“analytical and mathematical ability, as well as
imaginative and reasoning powers” (by one).

Knowledge

and experience

Of the six participants who commented on the
knowledge and experience of the ‘good’ innovator,
the following was considered important:
awareness of technologies (by two);
multi-disciplinary knowledge (by four);
0 experience of a wide range of industries
life in general (by two).

importance of market analysis and having a clear
view of the market was generally underlined. As
one said, “knowing the market place is more
important than being prolific with ideas” and “the
only kind of innovator that makes money is
responsive to the market”. When asked about
their personal strengths and competences,
one
highlighted the importance of project management
skills. One pointed out that it is important to
make sure that “the right compromise occurs
between product development and the market’s
needs”.

Why do people innovate?

The primary motive for innovative developments
includes various opportunities
for commercial
developments; for the development of new ideas;
financial rewards; an altruistic contribution; and
personal satisfaction. Responses to three questions
provided insights into the SMART winners’ motivation for innovation, as presented in Table 3.

What does your project mean to you? (See
A, Table 3.)
What are your main reasons for innovating?
(See B, Table 3.)
What do you hope to get out of your innovation? (See C, Table 3.)

Opportunities for commercial growth and the
development of new products are most frequently
mentioned by participants to explain what the
project means to them. However, the most often
cited reason for innovating is personal satisfaction,
followed by commercial development, then new
product developments. Personal satisfaction and
the possibility of new product developments rank
as the most frequently cited hopes that participants
have from the innovation. However, some of these
results require further clarification, as given below.

powerful motives. For some, innovation represented an important part of life; for others,
innovation represented life itself. In particular,
the challenge of innovation was perceived to
offer intellectual satisfaction. Some participants
mentioned that they constantly felt that there had
to be a better way of doing things. According to
another, the project represented fun and challenge
and “great satisfaction when everything works”.
Many SMART winners find the work involved in
innovative product development to be generally
satisfying, because they are doing what they want
to do. The nature of this satisfaction was different
to one participant, who was searching for the
satisfaction of glory, fame and the international
recognition by peers as a world class engineer.
4.2.

Opportunities for commercial
development of the firm

Many participants mentioned opportunities for
the commercial development
of their firm as
reasons for innovating. Innovation was perceived
to be of importance for business survival, business
development, growth, future sales, competitiveness
and market share. Innovation may be an imperative
for surviving long-term in business: “the SME
has no technical advantage without innovation,
especially in high technology, where innovation is
essential and you must ‘innovate or die”‘.
Only one participant described innovation “as
an intellectually interesting sideline to the main
business”. Six suggested that it is important for

business growth as well as for survival. Others
said that “future sales in the company depend on
successful new projects” and that the “rationale
for innovation is to gain market share and remain
competitive”. Others pointed out that “there is no
advantage in invention for invention’s sake and
that there should be some benefit to the company”.
Unfortunately,
compared with the time required
to develop the innovation, “the thrill of inventing
lasts only a short time, but innovation is essential
if you want to be a leading company”.

of

For many participants their project meant an
opportunity to implement ideas, develop ideas for
new products and expand their product range.
One participant talked about suffering from a
“continuous stream of ideas” which was described
as the “disease” of innovation. The act of innovation was perceived as the way to manage this
disease because it requires some filtering of
innovative ideas for commercial purposes and
market demands. In some cases, the innovative
project represented an exciting opportunity to do
something with ideas which the respondents had
had for a few years. For others, the project
represented a stepping stone to other projects and
a strong market position, especially for singleproduct companies. However, some participants
intended to sell or license ideas and move on to
new technical ideas for different applications.

rewards

An interesting result is that financial rewards
tended not to represent an important initial reason
for innovation in this group of innovators. Two
participants specifically mentioned that financial
gain was not relevant to their reasons for innovating. However, ten participants mentioned that
they hoped to gain financial rewards out of
the innovation. The importance of revenue for
company growth and further product development
was emphasized. One participant said that “it is
important to protect the thrill of inventing”.
However, two participants pointed out that there
are easier ways to make money. For example, one
said (with a touch of bitterness) that “next year I
am going to be a millionaire”, but added that
“there is a better return from the building society
than from innovation”

5. What risks were taken in order to
develop the innovative projects
technically and commercially?

Further insights on the nature of the innovator
come from a consideration of the risks taken by
the innovator. Generally, the risk area cited most
was finance, followed by marketing issues. Some
of the information presented in Table 4 is further
clarified below.
5.1.

Financial

risks

Some participants had risked their personal
resources. One had risked “everything and more”.

Some participants mentioned that the project
meant a lot to them because of the assistance it
would give to their customers and society. Although
one participant took pains to emphasize that his
company was not innovating in order to benefit
British industry, two went so far as to describe
their project as “morally useful”.

Another had not been paid for several months in
order to support the project.
In addition to risking personal finances and loan
capital, others had committed company turnover
to the project. For example, one committed S-10%
of turnover, another committed 30% and a third
committed as much as 50% for the project.
5.2.

Market

risks

The SMART winners interviewed
mentioned
the importance of market research because they
were aware of the high market failure of innovative
products. Some were concerned with the risks for
small companies, with few products, posed by
competitors’ innovative activities. In particular,
one participant pointed out that “smaller companies are often beaten up by the larger companies,
who have the commercial ‘muscle’ and brand
names to eitherout-compete
or even buy out new
innovations in the marketplace”.
Others were
concerned with the risks of working in small
markets or sophisticated markets, or markets with
only a few customers.

5.3.

Business vs. innovation

Two of the business owner-managers
in the
sample pointed out the conflict between “bread
and butter work”, which is necessary for business
survival, and R&D, which is necessary for business
growth. Innovative work diverts time and effort

77

<-----Page 7----->S. Caird

away from the main business of the company.
However, it is necessary if high-tech companies
are to remain in business for long.

5.4.

Technology risks

Three business owner-managers said that there
is a small technology risk that the project will not
work out technically. However, one pointed out
that “you rarely start from scratch with innovative
product development”. High-risk research is often
not commercially viable for the SME. Instead,
often the emphasis is on improvements in areas
of competitor weakness.

5.5.

Career risks

Five participants gave up their previous job,
career and promotion prospects. However, none
showed any aspiration to return to earlier positions
held and this would be difficult to do if their
business were to fail.

5.6.

Personal risks

Five business owner-managers mentioned personal risks, such as the fear of failure, of being
wrong and what failure would do to their reputation
amongst peers. For one, the innovative work had
already caused marital problems.
Although the type of risks taken by participants
may relate to their employment status and whether
or not they own the company, only two participants
mentioned that they had undertaken no risks in
order to develop their innovative project. One, a
business owner-manager, had received great support on both the technical and business aspects of
the innovation. However, the other, a managing
director (who was not the original innovator),
believed that the project was not worth the risk
and hoped to re-plan the project, in order to avoid
taking risks with a poor idea which would overtax the limited resources of a small company.

78

6. What is the nature of the innovator’s
role and the significance of that role for
the success of the innovative project?
The above consideration of risks undertaken by
SMART winners suggests that a strong role and
responsibility is taken for the development of
SMART projects. The nature of this role was
described as either managerial (by sixteen) or
inventive (by ten). Others described their role as
multi-tasking, in areas such as motivating and
managing others, sales, marketing and innovation.
One participant made the interesting comment
that “as well as being the instigator and overall
driving force, I am the customer until the project
gets to market”.
On the more inventive side, many were reluctant
to describe themselves as inventors, but discussed
how they “inspired product development” or used
lateral thinking techniques for innovation. When
asked about what contribution others made to the
project, it became clear that there were usually
other people involved, in a team effort of some
kind. Only one replied that there was no contribution to the project from others, although “working on your own could prove difficult and lonely”.
Another participant, involved in a team effort,
praised team operations in innovative developments, saying that “it is impossible to work
successfully without others” and “because of the
contribution of others, this project is no longer a
daft idea and is on the way to success”.
Since most innovative work involves some kind
of a team effort, how important is the innov.ator
for the innovation process and commercial success?
Ten participants believe that the innovator is very
importantfor the progress of the project, because
“they believe in the product” and are usually the
product champion. However, there may be some
differences
between
SMEs and the larger
enterprises. For example, one participant pointed
out that in the SME the innovator may have
greater importance for the progress of the project,
whereas in the larger enterprise organizational
politics may have greater significance. Whatever
the size of the company, many participants emphas-

Technovation

Vol. 14 No. 2

<-----Page 8----->How important

ized the importance of the innovator’s persistence
and determination for the progress of innovative
projects.
However, some participants
suggested that
“while the innovators are very important . . . they
should not get carried away on an ego trip . . .
and should be aware of financial and market
constraints”. Awareness of the innovator’s personal
limitations led eight participants to suggest that
the innovator is important only in the initial stages
of project development.
For example, it was
suggested that the innovator has little to offer
“once the concept is there and the inspiration is
supplied”. After this the innovator is less important
and the “project needs lots of worker bees”.
Another view was that there comes a point, after
the concept is developed, when “it is transferable
and often it is desirable that the innovative concept
is taken over by larger enterprises” because they
have the “resources and systems for further
development and are therefore more likely to
create success, money and jobs”.
Some viewed the innovator as a possible hindrance. This might be because, as one participant
thought, “the innovator tends to be a bit bogged
down with pet ideas” which may make it difficult
for innovators to develop their ideas in line with
customer demands. Another view is that the
innovator should “cease involvement with the
project once the technical development and patent
protection is secured” in order to give the project
a greater chance of commercial success. The
innovator’s role is “to mother it [the innovation]
until its first licence is sold”.
Unfortunately,
“the innovator is forced into
commercial activities because of the reluctance of
bigger companies to take in outside ideas”. This
reluctance is attributed to the so-called ‘Not
invented here syndrome’. This syndrome, which
militates against the innovator, is described as the
reluctance of companies to take in outside ideas,
because the company’s technical employees feel
threatened by projects which they feel they should
have developed themselves in-house. The jealousy
or rivalry attributed to these employees becomes
a problem for small innovators because their

Technovation

Vol. 14 No. 2

is the innovator

in SMEs?

larger company rivals, by virtue of their technical
expertise, are likely to be their appraisers. This
may leave the key innovator in the position of not
being the “best person but the only person” to
develop the innovation.
Whether or not the innovator is important or
harmful for the commercialization of an innovative
project, endeavours to remove them from the
project may prove annoying or hurtful for the
innovator. One participant was very critical of
managers’ attitudes, which are frequently to get
rid of the innovator and then exploit the innovation.
If the innovator is not necessary or beneficial for
the full innovative development
process, then
protection for his/her ingenuity and efforts at the
initial stages may be an important consideration.
Three participants said that the importance of
the innovator depends on who the innovator is
and whether the innovator has the skills, interests
and resources required for the development of
the idea for commercialization.
However, three
participants believe that the innovator is not
important for the commercial success of innovative
projects. One said that “it is often a recipe for
disaster if everything hangs on a key individual”
and pointed out that “the innovator is often a
maverick and the worst person to implement” the
commercialization process.
Others pointed out the importance of management support to carry the project through. “The
necessary commitment of resources is so great for
risky innovative work that management support is
necessary to give the project a chance of success”.
One said that “one hundred percent support from
the top managers within the organization is more
important for the progress of the project than the
original ideas person”. Even when innovators are
the top managers within the company, they may
be unable to offer strong support because of
commercial pressure for other business services
within the firm or a conflict of priorities between
managers and shareholders.
Slightly more participants described their own
role in the SMART projects, as opposed to the
mnovator’s role in general, as very important.
Thirteen of the participants described their role

<-----Page 9----->S. Caird

in promoting the success of the SMART project
as either very important or crucial for the coordination of innovative product development activities. Five participants described their role in
promoting the success of the project as quite
imporfunr, usually because of their technical or
managerial input. Five participants described their
role as important for the initial stages of project
development because they lacked the marketing
skills necessary to take the innovation to the
market place. Some suggested that once the patent
is secured, anyone could develop it. Others did not
want to develop the innovation beyond patenting,
because they preferred to get on with other
technological ideas.
Only one participant did not see his role as
important and “actually having a negative impact
on the progress of the project”. This participant
said that “the progress of the project depends on
the value of the product and not the cleverness
and ambition of the innovator . . . and it is more
important that it works than whether the innovator
was clever”. The innovation “. . . must succeed
because it works and not because the innovator
wants it to succeed”. This participant was not
involved in the day-to-day management of the
SMART project, believing that the project may
get on better without being hindered by the ‘boss
impact’, which can hinder necessary changes.
Further insights into the significance of the
innovator’s role for the commercial success of
the innovative project may be gained from a
consideration of the determinants of commercial
success. When participants were asked about the
factors which affect the success of their project,
only one mentioned the significance of the innovator’s own role. This is probably because they
take their own role for granted; when asked what
the commercial success of innovations in general
depends on, seven participants cited the significance of the innovator’s role. The responses to
the question on the determinants of commercial
success are given in Table 5. Some of these
responses are discussed further below.
Some participants did not subscribe to conventional definitions of success, such as financial

rewards or commercial success. However, one
participant said “it is hard to consider yourself a
success if you go bust”. The most cited condition
for innovation success was that there must be a
market demand for the innovative project. As one
participant said, “the innovation has got to stop
being an innovation and start being a commercial
product”. The importance of overcoming consumer
resistance to new products coming from small
companies was also an issue. For example, one
participant commented on the horror that buyers
have of new technology, which, together with the
risk of a small business going bankrupt, can create
considerable consumer resistance. Other marketing
issues of importance include: positioning the product in the market, and pricing the product at a
price which will sell.
When participants were asked about what the
commercial success of their own innovative projects
depends on, some additional conditions were
mentioned, such as:
luck, in terms of customer demand;
competitor activity;
securing cooperation
with and collaboration
from bigger companies;
economic recession;
locating materials for project development;
forthcoming
legislation, which will create a
demand for the project;
the cost effectiveness of the project;
timing with both the engineering and the sales
phase.

In the context of all these conditions which affected
the commercial success of SMART projects,
approximately 50% of the sample regarded the
innovator’s role as very important. Furthermore,
29% of the sample perceived that, in general, the
commercial success of innovations depends on
the innovator’s role. Further comments on this
contribution laid particular emphasis on qualities,
such as determination, “ruthless imagination” and
the ability to create the circumstances for the
innovation to succeed. One pointed out that “a lot
of innovations are wasted because of personality,
particularly a lack of determination when dealing
with obstacles.” An emphasis on determination
and commitment was again reiterated,
as one
pointed out that commercial success requires the
innovator to invest “10% inspiration and 90%
perspiration” in the project. Another mentioned
that “95% of innovators don’t realise that you
have to think your own time and money into the
innovation, which must be backed with everything
you have got”.

Conclusions

The importance of the innovator’s role for the
commercial success of innovative products is not
easy to establish, because it is a variable role and
there is no distinct ‘innovative personality’. Clearly,
the importance of the innovator’s role, in a general
sense, depends on certain factors such as who the
innovator is, what the project is about and whether
the innovator has the skills, interests and resources
to develop the project. Furthermore,
there are
many factors which affect the commercial success
of innovative projects, the most important of
which (to this sample) appears to be market
demand for the innovation. However, this study
has supported the idea that the innovator’s role is
very important for commercial success; 29% of
the sample mentioned that the commercial success
of innovations in general depends on the innovator’s role. However, this is one of many factors
which affect commercial success, and other frequently cited general factors include: good ideas,

market demand, skilled human resources, financial
support and technical viability.
Approximately
50% of participants described
the innovator’s role as very important for the
progress of the SMART project because innovators
were the “project champions” and the project has
no chance of being realized without their belief
and commitment. Others (-50%) described the
innovator’s role as quite important or important
at the initial stages, because of the limited nature
of the innovator’s competence which does not
always include marketing and general management. Furthermore,
the significance of the innovator is tempered by the involvement of others in
the innovative project. In all cases but one, the
innovative project was a team effort.
The significance of the innovator for the commercial success of an innovation may be lessened
when the innovator does not wish to manufacture
the innovative idea. In some cases, the innovator
intends or wishes to license the patented idea and
may feel frustrated if forced to work on the
commercialization of the innovation, especially if
he has other ideas to develop. In this case, the
willingness of larger enterprises to take over the
innovations of SMEs becomes very important for
commercial outcomes.
In other cases, the innovator may have a
significant but negative impact and jeopardize the
innovation, being unable to ‘let go’ of the idea to
allow for its commercial development. However,
the positive aspect of this tenacity is the innovator’s
determination, ownership and championing of the
project and the importance this has for bringing
the idea to the market place.
The significance of the innovator’s role is likely
to be commensurate with the risks undertaken in
order to develop the innovative project. As the
majority (75%) of those interviewed have generally
taken financial risks in their capacity as ownermanagers or managing directors in SMEs, it is
unsurprising that they perceived their own role,
and that of the innovator in general, as important
for the innovation process. One participant talked
about risking “everything and more” for the
commercial outcome of innovation.

81

<-----Page 11----->S. Caird

Other areas of risk included finding resources,
gaining market acceptance and establishing technical viability. Further risks included the opportunity
costs of innovation projects and the pressure that
product innovation puts on the other business
activities of SMEs. It seems likely that the innovator who takes business, financial, personal and
career risks is likely to be more significant for
the progress of the innovative project than the
innovator who takes no risks. This means that it
is likely that innovators who are also managing
directors or owner-managers in SMEs will be very
important for the commercial success of the
innovation.
One cannot address the importance of the
innovator’s role without considering the nature of
the role itself. This sample of innovators described
the nature of their role in the SME as primarily
managerial, inventive or both. Innovators who are
primarily managers are likely to be involved at all
stages of the innovation process, from the original
idea through to commercialization, whereas those
with a primarily inventive role are more likely to
have an intense but confined involvement in
technical testing and development,
leaving the
marketing activities to others.
The results of this study help to offer a profile
of innovators and their role in terms of their
competences and motivations. While these results
do not suggest that innovators have dominant
personality characteristics, something can be said
about the psychological make-up of innovators.
The SMART winners highlighted many different
characteristics to describe the sort of person
who makes a ‘good’ innovator, such as courage,
capability, motivation, persistence, relationship
skills and optimism. Over 50% of the participants
described the ‘good innovator’ in terms of various
personality characteristics. In addition, the innovator was described as having competences such
as inventive ability, technical competence, project
management skills, team skills, marketing skills
and a multi-disciplinary expertise.
In profiling the innovator, some consideration
should be given to his/her ability, which some
participants regarded as creative and inspired.

82

Some of the participants regarded themselves as
both scientists and artists. However, others tended
to rate the ability to apply technical expertise and
identify commercial potential higher than creativity
for explaining innovative ability. Ideas came easily
to some, and the real concern within the firm was
about securing a market demand for products. It
appears that though innovative ability may be
creative and inspired, this may misrepresent innovation as a mystical or disorganized process, which
is not tuned to market demand or market trends.
There were some views that innovation, particularly high-tech innovation, has become so sophisticated that ‘Eureka& are unlikely and small,
gradual, evolutionary steps are the reality. Different ideas about the nature of innovative ability
could be reflected in the fact that some projects
were more radically innovative than others. However, most of the projects involved incremental
rather than radical innovation. So this does not
appear to be a plausible explanation for these
different perspectives.
The participants in this study hoped that their
innovative work would create opportunities for
commercial development of their business, the
development
of new product ideas, financial
rewards and personal satisfaction. Some also hoped
to make altruistic contributions by working in
areas which would genuinely help society. It is
interesting that financial rewards tend not to
represent an important reason for innovation,
although it is something that 50% of participants
said they hoped to gain from their project. It
seems that financial rewards are important for
protecting innovative and business interests and
allowing for continued developments.
Financial
rewards may also be perceived as an index
of success. However,
some participants were
pessimistic about their prospects for financial
rewards; for example, one participant said that a
better return is gained from investing one’s money
in a building society than in innovative developments.
This study offers both quantitative and qualitative results, but these results cannot be conclusive
because of the exploratory nature of the work and

Technovation

the small sample size. It was important to conduct
an exploratory study because the significance
of the innovator for product innovation and
commercial success is an under-researched
area.
Some interesting results emerged from this study
which are relevant to our understanding of innovators, their role in product innovation in SMEs
and their significance for commercial success.
While these results are not proven for innovators
in general, they help to clarify what it means to
be innovative, which may help others to develop
innovative competences or understand innovative
people.
The importance of the innovator’s role for
commercial success depends on the role itself,
and this is clarified by exploring the innovator’s
competences, motives and risk-taking behaviour.
This role is established through the experience
and management of the many factors which affect
the commercial outcome. This research supports
the idea that the innovator’s role is important for
the commercial outcome of innovation in SMEs.
Further research on this role is important for
helping SMEs to attain greater commercial success
with their innovative products.
