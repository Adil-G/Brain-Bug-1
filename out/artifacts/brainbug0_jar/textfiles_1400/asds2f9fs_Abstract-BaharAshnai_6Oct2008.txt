The Role of Trust and Reliance in Business Relationships:
A Dyadic Operationalization
Research Importance
In business marketing there is a significant need for understanding business relationships
and how they are maintained and developed (Ford et al., 2006). Trust is posited as a
cornerstone for successful business relationships (Håkansson et al., 2004; Morgan and
Hunt, 1994). It is therefore important to understand in more detail how trust affects
business relationship. However, there is a lack of studies which clarify the different
aspects and sub-constructs of trust, instead considering trust as an amalgamated construct
(Mouzas et al., 2007). Furthermore, trust is usually perceived only from the perspective
of one actor (supplier or buyer) and not as a dyadic (and interactive) phenomenon. Thus,
there exists ambiguity in the literature about the precise role of trust as it operates at
different levels of analysis, and about how trust impacts on performance (Zaheer et al.,
1998). This study aims to address these issues.

Research Contribution
Studying various aspects of trust in a dyadic way, rather than using the more typical
single-level and monadic perspective, extends our knowledge on trust in business
relationships (Inkpen and Beamish, 1997; Fang et al., 2008). Specifically, this research
tries to distinguish two aspects of trust that operate at the inter-personal and the interorganizational level, and as such it models trust at the inter-organizational level as a
distinct construct called “reliance”.

Reliance is the degree to which a company rationally relies on another company, which is
the target of reliance, to do what has been expected. Here it is useful to delineate reliance
from dependence. Dependence, which is more related to power (Emerson, 1962), is the
degree to which a firm is dependent on its partner (i.e. the extent to which a partner
provides important and critical resources for which there are few alternative source of
supply (Buchanan, 1992)) and is measured by scales such as how much switching over to
another partner is harmful and difficult. On the other hand a company can have a high
reliance on its business partner even though there are potential alternatives for the
resources provided by its partner and there is not significant power-dependency in the
relationship. This study will examine the impact of the two different aspects of trust and
reliance on each other, and finally their impact on business relationship quality. It will
also study the mediating role of uncertainty.
Thus, firstly, this research will contribute to a better understanding of different aspects of
trust in business relationships. Secondly, this research also contributes by studying
business relationships from a dyadic perspective by considerating each of the latent
construct conceptualization and operationalization in a dyadic way. Thirdly,
understanding trust and reliance vis-à-vis uncertainty will provide useful practical
suggestions for firms involved in optimizing business relationships.

Research Methodology
A nomological model is proposed which will be tested at later stages of the study.
A qualitative pre-study will be done in order to find and validate items for measuring
inter-organizational reliance. For measuring other latent variables (e.g. trust), existing

item banks will be used and adapted. The research design will be based on a
questionnaire-based mail survey; such a quantitative approach is applicable as the
research will rest on theory testing. The analysis will be based on Structural Equation
Modeling (SEM) as it provides a useful technique for estimating the relationship between
constructs in the model (Bagozzi, 1994; Joreskog and Sorbom, 1993). Figure 1 illustrates
the initial underlying model.

This model hypothesizes that in a business relationship, inter-personal trust positively
affects inter-organizational reliance (Mouzas et al., 2007), inter-personal trust negatively
affects uncertainty, inter-organizational reliance negatively affects uncertainty (Ford et al.,
1998), uncertainty negatively affects relationship quality (Ford, 1980), inter-personal
trust positively affects relationship quality, and inter-organizational reliance positively
affects relationship quality. The model will be tested separately for buyer firms and for
seller firms and the results of the tests will be compared.
Emphasizing the dyadic aspect of business relationships, the data will be analyzed
subsequently based on a dyadic conceptualization. Therefore trust, reliance, and
uncertainty are considered and measured in a dyadic way by three subsets. First, for each
construct two scales are developed which are the ‘mean value’, and the ‘degree of
asymmetry’. Then for further development of the study another subset will be considered
(the ‘directionality of asymmetry’). The ‘mean value’ is the statistical mean of buyer

value and seller value regarding a construct; this operationalization is derived from Klein
et al. (2007) and Straub et al. (2004)’s aggregation technique for dyadic data based on
consideration of both symmetry and value. The ‘degree of asymmetry’ is the absolute
difference between the buyer value and seller value. Considering these aspects, an
advanced dyadic model is proposed in Figure 2. The model is based on hypotheses such
as the mean value of trust positively affects the mean value of reliance, the degree of
asymmetry of trust positively affects the degree of asymmetry of reliance, and the degree
of asymmetry of uncertainty negatively affects the relationship quality. The model will
also be tested, based on SEM.

The study is further developed by including the third subset, which is the ‘directionality
of asymmetry’. This subset enables investigating the impact of the asymmetry direction
of each construct (i.e. investigating what is the impact of the constructs’ asymmetry if the
construct is evaluated higher by the buyer side or by the seller side).
Data will be collected from companies that operate in services industry sectors in the UK
and US. This in itself extends our knowledge on business relationships as previous

studies in business marketing have focused mainly on products and industrial interactions.
As the unit of analysis is the dyad (a business relationship), data will be collected from
both buyer side and seller side and ‘matched’. Questionnaires relating to their business
customer relationships will be initially sent to seller (services) company (N =
approximately 5000). In the questionnaire, the contact information of the company’s
second biggest customer will be identified. Thus, the research will study an important
relationship (the ‘second biggest customer’), while avoiding the bias incurred by studying
the most important customer (which may cause issues around significant power
imbalance and dependency). Then another questionnaire (now relating to their seller
relationships) will be sent to the identified customer company whose contact details have
been given by the respondent. Assuming 20% response rate for the seller phase, we will
send out 1000 questionnaires to customers. Again assuming 20% response rate, 200
matching questionnaires will be collected, providing us with data for 200 dyads.
