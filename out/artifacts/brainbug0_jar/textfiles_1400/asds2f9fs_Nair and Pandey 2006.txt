Characteristics of Entrepreneurs:
An Empirical Analysis
K.R.G. NAIR AND ANU PANDEY 1
This paper examines the socio-economic and attitudinal characteristics of
entrepreneurs on the basis of primary data for the state of Kerala. It does not
appear that business acumen runs in families nor is there evidence that religion
has an impact on entrepreneurship. The economic status of the family, age, technical education/training and work experience in a similar or related field seem
to favour entrepreneurship. In comparison to the rest of the population, entrepreneurs tend to be more innovative in their attitude, but do not seem to have greater
faith in the internal locus of control.
K.R.G. Nair, formerly Professor of Business Economics, University of Delhi,
is presently Honorary Research Professor at the Centre for Policy Research,
New Delhi.
Anu Pandey is Research Scholar at the Department of Business Economics,
University of Delhi.

The 21st century has just witnessed the phenomenon of Communist
China recognising the importance of entrepreneurs by agreeing to admit
them as members of the communist party. The sparks that ignite the
spirit of enterprise in people are hence of considerable interest in today’s
world. Intellectual curiosity has existed for years among researchers
cutting across disciplines about the special characteristics that people,
who launch entrepreneurial ventures and succeed in them, possess. The
factors usually considered in this regard can be split into two groups—
socio-economic and attitudinal. This paper is an attempt to examine the
relationship of these two sets of factors with entrepreneurship and is based
on primary data collected in 2002 for Kerala, one of the states of India
renowned the world over as an outlier in the development firmament,
with social development far in excess of what is usually warranted by the
level of economic development.2 It first gives an idea of some of the prevailing views on entrepreneurship. It then explains the source and nature

of the data used in this analysis. The scope and methodology of the paper
are then elucidated. It then proceeds to present the results of the study for
Trissur that has been identified by a number of official expert committees
as an industrially backward district or administrative region of Kerala.3
An examination is then carried out to see whether these results for Trissur
can be generalised for the entire state of Kerala.
Prevailing Views
Many have highlighted socio-economic factors leading to the emergence
of entrepreneurship. For instance, Weber (1930) emphasised the role of
Protestant Christianity in the emergence of capitalism in the West. Sayigh
(1962), Alexander (1964) and Carroll (1965) provided empirical evidence
from Lebanon, Greece and the Philippines respectively, to support the
argument that successful entrepreneurs have a higher level of education
than the general public. Kunkel (1970) carried Weber’s argument further
to point out that entrepreneurial talent is not equally distributed among
populations in a number of countries. He supported his view by emphasising that religious, ethnic, displaced and immigrant minorities often tend
to be highly entrepreneurial. Young (1971) stressed the fact that entrepreneurial characteristics are found in clusters that may qualify themselves
as entrepreneurial groups. Sharma (1980) identified particular social groups
in India that were highly entrepreneurial. Ronstadt (1983) attempted to
relate the age of a person to his/her initiation into entrepreneurial activity
and found that most entrepreneurs initiate their entrepreneurial careers
between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-five years of age. Hisrich and
Peters (1995) identified certain areas of technical and industry experience
as the sine qua non for the emergence of entrepreneurship, particularly
in the field of manufacturing. They also examined the parental occupations
of entrepreneurs to find that entrepreneurs tend to have self-employed or
entrepreneurial fathers. According to Dollinger (1995), there exist momentum factors which include negative displacement, positive push and positive pull which activate entrepreneurial inclinations. Once these factors
spur the spirit of enterprise, situational factors based on perceptions of
desirability and feasibility determine whether the venture actually takes
off. Nath (2000) has reported on the regional distribution of entrepreneurs
by social groups in India.
Researchers have also laid considerable emphasis on the character and
personality traits of entrepreneurs.4 Two influential theoretical viewpoints

<-----Page 3----->Characteristics of Entrepreneurs / 49

in this regard are that of Schumpeter (1967) and Rotter (1966). According
to Schumpeter, the most distinguishing characteristic of an entrepreneur
is his innovative nature. The entrepreneur provides economic leadership
to engineer discontinuous dynamic change by forcing means of production
into new channels. He visualised this happening by means of a new combination of factors of production resulting in one or a few of the following:
introduction of a new product, institution of a new technology, opening
a new market, discovery of a new source of supply of raw materials and
carrying out a new form of organisation. In Rotter’s opinion, there are
two broad categories of people—people who believe that what happens
to them is the result of chance, luck or factors beyond their control termed
primarily believers in the external locus of control and people who believe
that, for the most part, the future is theirs to control through their own
efforts, termed as believers in the internal locus of control. According to
Rotter (1966), people who are entrepreneurial are more likely to believe
in the internal rather than in the external locus of control.
Nature and Sources of Data
Two primary data sets, collected as parts of a broader study, are used for
the analyses here.5 The first data set was of those who launched entrepreneurial ventures in the manufacturing industry in Trissur, irrespective of
whether they continued running them or not. These data were enlarged to
take into account information from people from other parts of Kerala,
including those who never ventured into business.
As regards Trissur, a list of large and medium industrial units of the
district was obtained from the District Industrial Centre (DIC) set up to
promote and monitor industries in the district by the Government of India.
The list of industrial units set up in industrial estates established in chosen
areas of the district to promote clusters of industrial units in these areas
was also available. There was however, considerable difficulty in locating
small industrial units located outside the industrial estates. But with the
help of DIC, the associations of small industries within and outside industrial estates and the Trissur Chamber of Commerce, a sample of thirty
functioning industrial units were chosen for the study. In view of the imperfections of the population frame, the sample was a purposive one with
care taken to see that the units of different sizes irrespective of their
location in the district were included in the sample. It was an even more
difficult task to locate closed industrial units and identify the people who
had set up such units. However, with the help of the Chamber of Commerce
Downloaded from joe.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on July 2, 2010

<-----Page 4----->50 / K.R.G. Nair and Anu Pandey

and Small Manufacturer’s Associations both within and outside the industrial estates sixteen such units were identified and contacted. An investigator went round with a detailed questionnaire to collect information
from the forty-six respondents.6 Though the questionnaires used for the
functioning and closed units were slightly different, both contained a
section with questions dealing with the socio-economic and attitudinal
aspects of the concerned entrepreneur.
To enlarge the sample to the whole of Kerala and also cover those who
never ventured into entrepreneurial undertakings, names and addresses of
people who underwent Entrepreneurship Development Programmes
(EDP) at different places in Kerala were obtained. The first such list
was obtained from the Regional Engineering College at Calicut and it
contained the names and addresses of thirty-five persons who attended
this programme for Science and Technology graduates by the Science
and Technology Board of the Government of India in 1998 and 2002.
The second list, obtained from Ernakulam, contained the names and details
of twenty-four persons who underwent EDP on Information Technology
organised by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development
in Ernakulam in 2002. The third list from Trivandrum contained details
of forty-five women who underwent EDP organised by the Centre for
Management Development in and around Trivandrum. A total of 104
persons were sent questionnaires by post to fill and return. The questionnaire used in this case was different from the two earlier questionnaires,
but contained questions dealing with socio-economic and attitudinal aspects
of the concerned respondent.7 Only thirty-four respondents—fourteen
from Calicut, eleven from Ernakulam and nine from Trivandrum—
responded. Of these five from Calicut, seven from Ernakulam and two
from Trivandrum were entrepreneurs who were running industrial units
while the rest were unemployed. The expanded sample thus consisted of
eighty persons and was more representative of Kerala as a whole in the
sense that it had representation from various parts of the state and contained respondents who had never launched any entrepreneurial ventures.8
Scope and Method
In the light of prevalent views on the factors affecting the emergence of
and success in entrepreneurship and of the availability of data for the
purpose of this study, attention is focussed on six possible socio-economic
factors and two attitudinal factors. For the purpose of analyses, we split
the six socio-economic factors into two sets. First, we can think of factors
Downloaded from joe.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on July 2, 2010

<-----Page 5----->Characteristics of Entrepreneurs / 51

that the entrepreneur is more or less born into. These are the occupation
of the father of the entrepreneur, religion and the economic status of the
family. These three factors are often referred to as factors affecting the
ascribed status of the entrepreneur. Other important factors considered
here are age, technical education/training and work experience in the
concerned or related fields. In contrast with the first set of factors, the
second set is acquired and hence, can be described as factors affecting
achieved status in society. Two attitudinal factors—innovativeness and
belief in internal or external locus of control—are considered.
As regards the occupation of the father, attention is focussed on finding
out whether entrepreneurship comes through ‘blood’ in the sense that
people with their respective fathers in business also take up business as
their profession. From the point of view of religion, attention is concentrated on whether being a non-Hindu and a member of one of the minority
religious communities in Kerala has an impact on entrepreneurship.9
Hence, respondents were classified into two groups—Hindus and nonHindus. In the questionnaire the respondents were asked whether in their
opinion they belonged to an economically poor, lower middle, upper middle or rich family. Those who identified themselves with the first two
categories were considered economically weak and the rest were treated
as economically well-off. The analysis of age was carried out by classifying
the respondents into two groups—those less than thirty-five years of age
and those above thirty-five years of age. On factors such as technical
education/training and work experience in the concerned or related fields,
respondents were classified on the basis of whether they had some or no
amount of the concerned factor. As regards attitudinal factors, the data
were generated from the answers given by the respondents to specific
questions in the questionnaire. A question was asked whether they were
always eager to learn about new developments. Those who responded
positively were considered innovative and the others, non-innovative.
Respondents were also asked whether they consulted an astrologer before
taking crucial decisions in life. Those who answered in the affirmative
were taken to believe in the external locus of control and the rest, in
the internal locus of control.
The data for the study were mostly qualitative in the sense of having
dichotomous respondents on the basis of whether they possessed or did
not possess a particular attribute. The analysis was, therefore, carried out
mainly by closely examining the tables giving the classification of respondents on the basis of two attributes. Chi-square statistic was used on the
Downloaded from joe.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on July 2, 2010

<-----Page 6----->52 / K.R.G. Nair and Anu Pandey

assumption that the attributes were independent. To examine the degree
of association between the attributes, Yule’s coefficient was calculated.
The relationship between socio-economic and attitudinal factors, and
the emergence and degree of success in entrepreneurship relating to fortysix entrepreneurial ventures in Trissur were examined. Entrepreneurship
was treated as synonymous with embarking upon a business venture.
Those whose ventures had to be closed down were treated as failed and
those who continued in their ventures were assumed to have some degree
of success.
Factors Affecting Ascribed Status: Trissur Study
Father’s Occupation: Table 1 presents those who set up enterprises in
Trissur on the basis of their being successful or unsuccessful and on their
fathers’ occupation being business or not.

Only nineteen or 41 per cent of the forty-six persons had their fathers
as businessmen. There is thus little to indicate that those who took to
business ventures were predominantly from business families and hence
with business backgrounds. As regards the degree of success in the entrepreneurial venture, data did not support the commonly held view that the
business background of the family helps in success in business. While eight
of the sixteen or 50 per cent of those who had to close their ventures had
their fathers also in business, only eleven or 36.7 per cent of the thirty who
were successful in their entrepreneurial ventures had their fathers who
ran business enterprises. Testing the hypothesis that there is no relationship
between business successes and having one’s father in business, by means
of the chi-square test lends further credence to such a view. In fact there
were some indications that the relationship is the other way round because
the coefficient of association between success in business and a business
background was negative though the value of the coefficient is only –0.26.

Religion: Details regarding the religion of those who undertook entrepreneurial ventures, successfully or unsuccessfully, in Trissur are given in

The evidence given in Table 2 does not lend much support to the view
that religious minorities are ahead of others in entrepreneurial pursuits.
Only fifteen or 33 per cent of the forty-six who embarked on entrepreneurial pursuits were non-Hindus and belonged to minority religious groups
in Trissur. There are thus indications that it is the majority community in
terms of religion that took the lead in launching entrepreneurial ventures.
As regards the degree of success in business as shown by the closure or
non-closure of units, eight or 50 per cent of the sixteen ventures which
had to close down belonged to persons from religious minorities whereas
twenty-three or 77 per cent of the thirty who were successful in the sense
of having their units running belonged to the majority community—the
Hindus. The value of chi-square on the basis of the hypothesis that religion
and success in business are independent, turned out to be as high as 3.42.
This value, though not significant at a 5 per cent level, is somewhat high
and gives rise to second thoughts about the attributes of being a Hindu
and being successful in business as being independent. This is further
strengthened by the fact that the coefficient of association between being
a member of the majority Hindu community and being successful in business is positive (0.53).
Family Status: Table 3 classifies entrepreneurs of closed and operating
units in Trissur on the basis of their belonging to economically better-off
or worse-off families.
Data given in Table 3 indicates that considerable entrepreneurial talent
emerged from families that were not economically well-off. Thirty-one
or 67 per cent of the forty-six persons who undertook entrepreneurial
ventures were from not so well-off families. Evidence regarding the impact
of the economic condition of the family on the success or failure in running

<-----Page 8----->54 / K.R.G. Nair and Anu Pandey

an enterprise was however different. Thirteen or 43 per cent of the thirtysix successful entrepreneurs were from economically better-off families,
whereas fourteen or 88 per cent of the sixteen unsuccessful entrepreneurs
were from economically worse-off families. For the hypothesis that the
degree of success in running an enterprise is independent of the economic
status of the family, the value of chi-square turned out to be 4.78 giving
us adequate grounds not to accept the hypothesis at a 5 per cent level of
significance. There were indications that the better-off the family, the
greater the chances of success in business ventures. In fact, the coefficient
of association between the economic condition of the family and the degree
of success of the venture is positive (0.69).

Table 4 clearly shows that there was a blend of youth and old age among
those who ventured into entrepreneurial undertakings in Trissur since
twenty-two or 47.8 per cent of these forty-six persons were less than thirtyfive years of age suggesting that there is little relationship between the
age of a person and the entrepreneurial spark in him. However, as regards
the success in business, the results were slightly different. The hypothesis
Downloaded from joe.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on July 2, 2010

<-----Page 9----->Characteristics of Entrepreneurs / 55

that there is no relationship between age and success in business (chisquare = 4.41; p< .05) was therefore, rejected. In fact, there age seemed
to have a positive impact on the degree of success in business—63.3 per
cent of the successful entrepreneurs were thirty-five or more in age, whereas
68.8 per cent of the unsuccessful entrepreneurs were under thirty-five
years of age. Success in business and youth were negatively associated
yielding a coefficient of association of –0.58.
Technical Education/Training: Table 5 gives the classification of successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs in Trissur on the basis of their having
or not having technical education/training.

It can be seen from Table 5 that a technical orientation perhaps helped
to spark the spirit of enterprise (chi-square = 5.12; p< .05). Twenty-two
or 48 per cent of the forty-six persons who set up enterprises in Trissur
had at least some technical education/training. The same logic seems to
hold true also for the degree of success in entrepreneurial ventures. While
eighteen or 60 per cent of the thirty successful entrepreneurs had some
technical education/training, twelve or 75 per cent of the sixteen unsuccessful entrepreneurs had no technical education/training at all. In fact,
the attribute technical education/training had a positive coefficient of association (0.64) with the degree of success of the entrepreneurial venture.
Related Work Experience: Table 6 gives the details of the presence or
absence of earlier work experience in concerned or related fields among
those who embarked on entrepreneurial ventures in Trissur.
Table 6 indicates that earlier work experience of a similar or related
nature helped (chi-square = 4.34; p< .05) in setting up and successfully
running the ventures. Nearly half of the forty-six persons who embarked
on entrepreneurial activities had earlier experience of this kind. If we
consider the degree of success of these ventures, this point is driven home
even more forcefully. While 56.7 per cent of the successful entrepreneurs
Downloaded from joe.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on July 2, 2010

<-----Page 10----->56 / K.R.G. Nair and Anu Pandey

had earlier work experience of this kind, 75 per cent of the unsuccessful
ones had no similar prior experience. This is further substantiated by the
fact that the coefficient of association between the degree of success in
business and earlier work experience in a related field is positive (0.66).

Attitudinal Factors: Trissur Study
Innovativeness: We had hypothesised that the attributes of innovativeness
and business success to be independent; but the value of the chi-square
statistic turned out to be 4.55 giving us adequate ground not to accept
this hypothesis. It appears that innovativeness and entrepreneurship often
go together (Table 7). This is so because twenty-nine or 63 per cent of
the forty-six who ventured into business were innovative. Further, while
73.3 per cent of the successful entrepreneurs were innovative, 58.3 per
cent of the unsuccessful entrepreneurs appeared non-innovative in their
attitudes. This stands further substantiated by the fact that the coefficient
of association between the attributes innovativeness and the degree of
success in business was found positive (0.56).

Locus of Control: Table 8 shows that a majority of persons embarking on
entrepreneurial ventures believed in the internal locus of control. Thirtyone or 67.4 per cent of the forty-six respondents had faith in the internal
locus of control. There was, however, no evidence to suggest that the
Downloaded from joe.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on July 2, 2010

<-----Page 11----->Characteristics of Entrepreneurs / 57

percentage of entrepreneurs having faith in the internal locus of control
was much higher among the successful entrepreneurs than among the
unsuccessful ones. While 68.8 per cent of the unsuccessful entrepreneurs
had faith in the external locus of control, the corresponding figure for
successful entrepreneurs was also as high as 66.7 per cent.

The chi-square statistic to test hypothesis that the attributes locus of
control and the degree of success in business are independent, had a very
small value of 0.02. Moreover, the coefficient of association between faith
in the internal locus of control and success in business is positive (0.05).
Extension of the Study to the State of Kerala
An attempt was made to examine whether the results obtained for Trissur
held good for the state of Kerala as a whole. This was done by carrying
out a similar analysis on a sample size of eighty that included thirty-four
persons from other parts of Kerala besides the forty-six already chosen
from Trissur. Since the additional thirty-four observations consisted also
of people who had never undertaken entrepreneurial ventures, this part
of the study classified persons as entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs.
The analyses were carried out with respect to factors affecting ascribed
status, acquired status and attitudinal factors.
Factors Affecting Ascribed Status: Table 9 gives details of the factors affecting the ascribed status of the eighty entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs
from different parts of Kerala.
The data also indicated that the spirit of entrepreneurship and the degree
of entrepreneurial success were not directly related to the father’s occupation. This was clear even from the class-frequencies, chi-square values
and co-efficient of association (Table 9).
As regards the relationship between religion and entrepreneurship, the
evidence for Kerala as a whole corroborates a major finding of the Trissur
study (see Table 9).

With respect to the relationship between the economic condition of
the family and entrepreneurship, the findings for Kerala as a whole were
similar to that for Trissur.
Factors Affecting Acquired Status: Details regarding factors affecting
the acquired status for entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs for Kerala is
given in Table 10.
As regards age, the evidence in Table 10 shows that what was true of
Trissur also held true of Kerala as a whole.
Likewise, the relationship between entrepreneurship and technical
education/training, for Kerala as a whole was similar to the results obtained
for Trissur. In the case of the relationship between related work experience
and entrepreneurship, the evidence for Kerala as a whole also paralleled
that of Trissur.

Attitudinal Factors: As regards the relationship between entrepreneurship
and innovativeness, the findings for Kerala as a whole were similar to
those for Trissur.
If we consider the belief in the locus of control and entrepreneurship,
the findings were again similar.
Conclusion
This study examined some of the socio-economic and attitudinal factors
that are generally believed to spur people to launch entrepreneurial ventures and continue as entrepreneurs. The study was based on primary
data collected from those who launched entrepreneurial ventures in the
field of manufacturing industry irrespective of whether these were still

<-----Page 14----->60 / K.R.G. Nair and Anu Pandey

running or were closed and also from persons who never attempted such
endeavours in the Indian state of Kerala. The analyses of these primary
data in the light of earlier views in this regard have thrown up some interesting findings.
The results do not indicate that business acumen ran in families. As regards religion, the evidence indicates that the religious community to
which one belonged did not impact on one’s venturing into entrepreneurial
pursuits or succeeding in them. When we consider the economic status
of the family, there seems to be some evidence that the more economically
better-off a family, the greater the chances of its embarking on entrepreneurial ventures and succeeding in them. As for age, the evidence broadly
suggests that maturity in terms of age favoured success in entrepreneurial
ventures. Both technical education/training and work experience in a similar or related field favourably affect entrepreneurship. The Schumpeterian
view that entrepreneurs are innovative in their attitudes is substantiated.
As regards entrepreneurs having greater faith in the internal locus of control compared to the rest of the population is borne out by the data obtained.
