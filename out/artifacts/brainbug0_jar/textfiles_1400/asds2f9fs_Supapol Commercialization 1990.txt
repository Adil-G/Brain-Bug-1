Many technological
advances in the civilian and industrial
world are spin-offs from government-funded,

experience to highlight and isolate relevant factors that hinder
or promote commercialization.
Amongst several critical variables, a case is made for greater and earlier business or industrial input in project design and formulation.

1. Introduction
While the principal goal of most govemmentfunded R&D is to develop new technologies for
public purposes, many cases have been documented where government-funded
technologies
have generated considerable industrial spillover
benefits [4,13,26,27,33,34,40].
Innovation for public sector needs can be generated by R&D conducted either in government laboratories (intramural R&D) or, contracted out to private firms,
universities or non-profit organizations (extramural R&D). It has generally been argued that a
greater fraction of public technologies will find
their way into commercial application if research
is performed by private companies, principally
because profit-seeking firms are more motivated
by potential pecuniary returns from the commer* I am grateful

cialization of research results. Often there are
several possible avenues through which govemment research can proceed. When R&D is performed by private companies, a research agenda
involving greater opportunities for commercial
spin-offs is likely to be selected. In addition, by
placing government research in the hands of
potential users, the costly process of transferring
research results may be avoided.
In spite of the potential for commercial spinoffs, many government-sponsored technologies remain unexploited commercially. Only 12.4 percent
of all U.S. federal government sponsored inventions patented in 1957 and 1962 were in commercial use, and only 2.7 percent played a critical role
in the commercial products for which they were
used [17]. The purpose of this study is to examine
empirically the extent to which commercial development has resulted from contracted research, and
to examine factors which promote or hinder commercial utilization.
1.1. Review of the literature
Economists,
R&D
practitioners
and policy
analysts have given extensive consideration to the
issue of commercial fall-outs from government
R&D. Although dated, one of the most thorough
studies of commercial utilization of inventions
arising from research performed under govemment contract was conducted in 1968 by Harbridge House [17]. According to the study, commercial utilization was greater when the contractor had the rights to the invention and when the
contractor had prior experience with the technology involved. Commercial utilization was also
found to be a function of the size of the contrac-

B.V. (North-Holland)

<-----Page 1----->tor, and the proportion of the contractor’s business with the government.
In a 1982 study, Nelson [33] assessed the consequences of U.S. government support in seven
major
sectors
(semiconductors;
commercial
aircraft; computers; agriculture; pharmaceuticals;
residential construction; and motor vehicles) and
concluded that, insofar as the generation of civilian
technological advances is concerned, in all successful cases the “producer-provider”
and the
“demander-user” relationships had a central role,
and that the extent to which a demand, either
public or private, makes innovation profitable depends, inter aliu, on the property rights regime
imposed by government.
In 1984, Mansfield and Switzer [26] examined a
sample of U.S. firms engaged in govemment-supported energy R&D and found that about onethird of the contracts resulted in immediate spinoff R&D projects. They state that the probability
of an R&D contract resulting in a spin-off was
found to be higher, the greater the input from the
contractor in the project definition stage, and when
contract and self-financed R&D were conducted
in the same location. A business orientation and
an appropriate tec~olo~c~
connection therefore
appear to be important determinants.
Further evidence on commercial spin-offs has
been provided by A.D. Little [3], Baer et al. [5],
McEachron [27], Comer et al. [ll], and Ettlie [13].
In all these studies there appears the common
hypothesis that the earlier market considerations
are incorporated into project planning, the more
likely the government project will realize commercial success.
This paper examines systematically the joint
influence of contractual design factors, i.e. early
market consideration,
property rights regime,
technological connection;
and characteristics
of
the contractor, i.e. size and R&D orientation of
the contractor, as well as other relevant factors.
The unique Canadian survey data base used for
this analysis is described in section 2. Bivariate
and regression results are presented in sections 3
and 4, respectively. A brief summary and conclusion follows.
2. Data description
The primary sources of quantitative information used in this study were: (1) a survey question-

naire of the Canadian Department of Transportation (hereafter Transport Canada) R&z D contracts
conducted in 1984-85; (2) Statistics Canada-Science and Technology division data bank; (3) confidential Transport Canada contract documents
and open reports on innovations and project outcomes; and (4) the Annual Indexes of the
Canadian Patent Office Record, a Department of
Consumer and Corporate Affairs publication.
The unit of analysis for the study was a govemment research and development contract intended
principally to generate new technologies or information for government
use (mission-oriented
R&D) in the area of transportation. To select an
appropriate sample of R&D contracts, a random
sample of 45 contracts, reflecting research in various fields of tr~spo~ation,
was examined. The
number of R&D contracts selected from each
research program was designed to represent as
closely as possible their respective proportion in
total Transport Canada extramural R&D spending, given the nomination process and the varied
cooperation from government officials. To ensure
that there was sufficient documentation and that
success and failure was possible, only those contracts larger than 100,000 dollars and, those completed by 1984 were considered.
Once the sample contracts were selected, a
questionnaire was sent out to the contractors. The
questionnaire was divided into sections covering
background information
about the responding
contractor and the R&D contract results. A different questionnaire
was also distributed
to
government scientific officers in charge of the
same R&D contract. These questionnaires were
supplemented by follow-up interviews with private
scientific
managers
and government
project
officers. Not all contractors responded to the
questionnaire completely. As a result, the number
of contracts used in the statistical analysis varied
between 39 and 41, depending upon the focus of
investigation. Because of disclosure rules, individual observations could not be reported. In addition, because of the proprietary nature of the
data, many statistical analyses were carried out for
the author by government officials who are privy
to the data.
Obtaining a measure of commercial spin-offs or
benefits is admittedly problematic. Ideally, commercial benefits to the contractor would be the
discounted future profits to the firm as a result of

<-----Page 2----->A. Bhanich Supapol / Commercialization

the government
contract research. This information, however, is not presently available and is not
expected to be available in the near future. Instead
contractors
and government
project officers were
asked to indicate whether or not any direct commercial benefits were realized. Direct benefits were
defined to have been realized if the technology
(principal or peripheral) conceived under contract
was utilized commercially
by the contractor or by
other companies. The term “commercial
benefits”
as used here means only the industrial application
of the technology by commercial
enterprises
and
not commercial benefits in the strict cost-benefit
sense. The general approach in the data analysis
was initially to establish the relationship
between
contractor
and contract
characteristics,
and the
proportion
of contracts in which commercial
applications were realized. These variables were then
analyzed
in a causal model using multivariate
regression analysis.

3. Results of the survey
3.1. Contractor survey and project officer survey
The extent to which direct commercial benefits
were realized is summarized
in table 1. An interesting by-product of contractor and project officer
surveys is a comparison
of the respective assessments made by each party with regard to commercial benefits resulting from a given contract. Both

groups of respondents
were asked essentially
the
same question. Did they give the same answer?
The tabulation
of responses from both groups
with regards to the proportion
of contracts realizing commercial benefits is presented in table 1. It
appears
that they agree on this aspect of the
contract outcome 37 percent of the time. However, in 18 percent of the cases the contractors
found direct commercial benefits while the project
officers did not. Similarly,
in 18 percent of the
cases the project officers found direct commercial
benefits while the contractor
did not.
Neither party can be construed
to be more
prone to overstating
(or understating)
the benefits
of a contract. Both groups found the same proportion of contracts
involving no direct commercial
benefits (63 percent).
3.2. Contractual
benefits

relationship

and direct commercial

There are two major facets of the contractual
relationship
which may be relevant to the realization of commercial benefits: (1) market considerations; and (2) disposition
of intellectual
property
rights. The extent to which there are market considerations
in the design and formulation
of the
R&D projects depends significantly
on the extent
to which there is private
input.
Typically,
a
government
research project can be formulated
either by a government
agency, or by a private
sector firm whose research interests overlap with
government
research objectives and thereby, warranting
public
funding
(unsolicited
projects).
Whether or not a government-financed
R&D project results in a technology which can be usefully
applied in the market place is likely to depend on
the extent to which the contractor
is involved in
the formulation
of the project objectives,
plans
and strategies.
Presumably
contractors’
interests
and needs are more likely to be realized when they
are rigorously identified and iterated at the beginning of the project, rather than after the technology has already been developed.
Federal R&D
contracts with initiative and origination
by private
sector firms are therefore more likely to be market
oriented,
and thus more likely to realize useful
follow-on commercial
developments
than govemment initiated
contracts.
Approximately
44 percent of the contracts examined were initiated by
the private sector.

The second important contractual feature is the
assignment of intellectual property. In Canada,
the disposition of property rights is generally
governed by the standard contractual provision
DSS1036 which vests all rights to all research
output with the government. As a consequence,
there is generally no incentive to make further and
often large investments to commercialize technologies developed under contract. However, in some
cases where a contractor’s proprietary knowledge
and/or technologies are required for a project, the
government has explicitly relinquished claim to
the principal rights to innovations conceived under contract. In the sample of R&D contract
collected, the government waived the rights to
such technologies in about a third of the cases.
Presumably one could expect to see greater incidences of commercial benefits when rights are
assigned to the contractor, either because of the
incentives provided by property rights, and/or
because of the contractor’s prior experience with
and knowledge of the technology in question.
In analyzing the data, account also has been
taken of several other features which may affect

research outcome. The commercialization
of research results developed under contract may be
influenced by the type of research being conducted. In general, it would seem that immediate
commercial
application
of government-funded
technologies is less likely, when the contracted
research is basic or generic research (e.g. fundamental investigation to acquire knowledge for its
own sake) and when the research is in pursuit of a
regulatory mandate. The type of contract more
likely to generate immediate spin-offs is a contract
for applied (development) research with a relatively large component of proprietary technologies.
In the context of the present study, Transport
Canada supports three basic areas of R&D in
transport technology: railway and surface technology; air technology; and marine (including arctic
marine) technology. To indicate the effect of
structural differences between operating requirements of each mode and differences in the technology involved on commercialization, the proportion of contracts realizing commercial spin-offs is
cross tabulated against modes of technology.
Additional contractual features examined in this
paper are the size of the contract and time since
contract completion. Cross tabulation results are
reported in table 2.
In the opinion of the contractors, the proportion of contracts resulting in direct commercial
benefits was: (1) greater for unsolicited projects
than for government-initiated projects; (2) greater
for contracts with property rights vested in the
contractors; (3) greater for contracts in the rail
and surface mode than in the air and the marine
modes; (4) greater for contracts in excess of
$200,000 than for contracts of less than $200,000;
and (5) greater for contracts which had been completed for less than two or more than five years at
the time of the survey.
This survey differs from the project officers’
assessment in that it: (1) implies a higher proportion of commercialization
in the case of unsolicited projects than does the project officer survey;
(2) reports a higher proportion of commercializations in contracts in excess of $200,000 than does
the project officer survey; and (3) the contractor
survey reports the highest proportion of commercializations in the rail and surface mode whereas
the project officer survey reports the highest proportion of commercializations
in the air mode.

Both surveys concur in reporting higher proportions of commercialization for contracts assigning
property rights to the company.
3.3. Contractor

profile

and direct commercial be-

From the survey questionn~re, it was possible
to elicit basic data on the age, size, ownership, and
other relevant characteristics of the contractor.
The first issue examined is whether the commercial application of technologies developed under
contract would be more likely (less costly) within
the context of a manufacturing (industrial) firm
than with a service firm (R&D
contractor or
consultant). It has been argued that since service
firms are less likely to be the ultimate users of new
technologies, and therefore would incur additional
and often substantial costs such as licensing costs
in arranging for commercial exploitation, a firm
with manufacturing capabilities is more likely to
generate spin-offs than a service firm [7].
The second issue examined is whether ownership status influences the production of commercial spin-offs. Foreign-owned firms are relatively
more active in a variety of products and geographic markets, and thus are more likely to be
able to commercialize a greater proportion of their
R&D
output than domestic firms. However,
foreign subsidiaries tend to perform a predominant amount of research at corporate headquarters,
and perform contract R&D locally in isolation
from the main-line commercial research of the
company. It has been noted elsewhere that where
a firm’s commercial projects are completely separate from its government projects there is little
interaction, information exchange and proper coupling of the types of research necessary to bring
about fruitful commercial spin-offs [26]. The net
influence of ownership status on spin-offs is therefore to be determined.
Results of R&D are often unpredictable. The
precise outcome is never clear, and success, or
failure, of an R&D activity is revealed only after
the fact. Often the discovery of a peripheral technology or peripheral use of a new development
will prove to be more valuable to the firm than the
intended technology. The uncertainty associated
with research activity should decline as research
and research management experience accumulates.
The ability to seek out and assess technologies for

373

commercial exploitation, and the ability to deal
with technological uncertainties should increase
with development and industrial experience. A
firm’s experience could be reasonably proxied by
age of the firm [24,25]. Therefore, it is postulated
that commercialization should be more prevalent
amongst older firms than younger firms.
The probabi~ty of commercial benefits may
also increase with the proportion of self-financed
R&D conducted by the contractor. The intuition
behind this is that contractors engaged in on their
own account presumably have an eye to its commercialization.
Contract R&D
may “fit” with
self-financed R&D. Alternatively, the contractor
may have the skill and inclination to see and
exploit commercial potential.
Finally, commercial benefits may vary directly
with the size of the contractor. The hypothesis is
that inventiveness is positively related to size since
large firms can better realize economies of scale
than smaller firms, and since larger and more
diversified firms can produce and market a higher
proportion of their results (peripheral or intended)

The relationship
between contractor
characteristics and the proportion
of contracts
in which
commercial applications
were realized is presented
in table 3.
The results indicate that the proportion
of projects in which direct commercial benefit was realized was higher if the contractor
was in the
m~ufactu~ng
sector and if the contractor
was
foreign owned. The likelihood of direct commercial benefit was higher for companies
aged 10 to
30 years and higher, and for smaller (in terms of
employment)
contractors.
These results are similar
to those obtained when direct commercial
benefit
was assessed by the project officers.

the probability function:

where Pi denotes the probability that the i th
contract yielded direct commercial benefits and
Xii... X,,i denotes the first through nth characteristics of the i th contract. Contractors’ assessments
of commercial benefits are used in the regression
analysis.
The list of contract and contractor characteristics included in the model is defined in table 4. To
avoid n&specification
problems, the nature of
R&D resources absorbed by the contract was
included to reflect the company’s opportunity cost
of undertaking contract research, and the firm’s
average patent stock was added to reflect the
inventiveness of the company.
In addition, a government-benefit
variable was
included to reflect the potential trade-off between
government and commercial benefits. This variable assumes a value of one if the technology
developed was successfully utilized by the govemment, and zero otherwise. It is often argued that
government R&D contracts are generally oriented
towards the fulfillment of some “mission oriented”
tasks related directly to departmental mandates,
and have relatively small civilian components.
Technologies which the government finds useful
may be less likely than others to have commerical
potential. On the other hand, it has also been
argued that projects which produce information or
technology that is directly usable by the govemment, would also result in some direct commercial
benefits 1331.
It is a common practice when dealing with a
dichotomous dependent variable to assume that
equation (1) is either a linear function or a logistic
function [2]. While a logistic function is theoretically appealing because the expected probability is
bounded between 0 and 1, a major advantage of
specifying a probability model in a linear fashion
is the uncomplicated interpretation of parameter
estimates [9]. The coefficient of an independent
variable indicates the amount of change in the
dependent variable, for a given unit change in X.
That is, it indicates directly the marginal effect of
X on the probability. Furthermore, in a linear
model the probability is not restricted to lie along
a logistic curve. As a consequence the linear probability model was employed.

An econometric complication which arises when
the regressand is restricted to a subset of the real
line is that the residual variance is not a constant.
This, in turn, causes the s significance test (t-test)
to be invalid. Consequently, White’s [42] method
for dealing with heteroskedastic residuals was applied.
With a total of 40 contracts included and with
asymptotic t-ratios given in parentheses, the fitted
linear probability model is:

Following the Harbridge House [17] study, it
was assumed that the underling relations~p between the probability of a spin-off and the proportion of total R&D that is contracted with the
government is non-linear. To measure how well
the model fits the data, McFadden’s R2 statistic is
provided. Similar to the usual adjusted R2 statistics, the higher the McFadden’s R2, the better the
model fits the data. The reported P-statistic indicates that the probability of commercial benefits
can be successfully explained by the independent
variables included taken as a group as it is statistically significant at the standard acceptable confidence level of 95 percent. The model is also successful in disentangling the joint effect which these
characteristics exert on the probability of realizing
commercial benefits. This is demonstrated by the
generally significant t-statistics.

Of particular
interest is the effect of the unsolicited project variable
(market
consideration
and business orientation)
on the probability
that
the government-funded
technology can be usefully
applied in the market place. Consistent
with expectations,
the unsolicited
proposal
(industrial
origination)
variable (UP) has a positive coefficient which is statistically
sig~ficant
at the 95
percent confidence
level. This finding
provides
support
for the hypothesis
that the greater the
input of the contractor
in the formulation
of the
R&D project, the greater the likelihood of a contract realizing commercial
benefits. By the same
token, this result also implies that governmentinitiated contracts
are less likely to realize commercial benefits, perhaps because these contracts
typically are in pursuit of a regulatory
mandate
rather than specific technology with potential
for
civilian spillovers.
The property right effect is positive and significant at the 99 percent confidence level. Contractor
retention
of property rights is therefore stimulative to private commercial
exploitation.
However,
this result must be interpreted
cautiously.
The
government
typically confers ownership
to technologies developed under contract to the contractor when the contractor’s
existing proprietary
information
and/or
technologies
are required
in
order to complete the intended
research. Higher
incidences
of commercial
spin-offs are therefore
possibly consequences
of proprietary
technology
already in the possession of the contractor,
rather
than ownership
incentives
provided by the contract.
Other things being equal, the probabi~ty
of
direct commercial benefits increases as the size of
the contractor
(in terms of revenues)
increases,
and decreases with the age of the contractor.
With
regard to the former finding,
this seems to be
consistent
with the proposition
that inventiveness
is positively related to size, since (1) large firms
can better realize economies of scale than smaller
firms, and (2) larger and more diversified
firms
can produce and market a higher proportion
of
their R&D results than those firms with Iimited
product lines. The latter result is anomalous,
as
more experience should imply a higher probability
of commercial spin-offs. There are several possible
explanations.
First, age of the corporation
may
not adequately reflect the general problem-solving
ability and experience of the R&D personnel and

of government-s~onsu~ed

technologies

management.
Experience
measure may be further
contaminated
due to the fact that some of the
contracting
firms were spin-off firms from older
and usually more established
research corporations. The second possible
explanation
is that
younger
firms may indeed
pursue
commercial
spin-offs with greater intensity than older firms.
The regression
results show that the foreign
ownership variable has a negative and statistically
significant
coefficient.
It would therefore appear
that the strong negative
effect of technological
separation
more than offsets the positive effect of
product
diversification,
and would suggest that
proper interface
of government
and private research is an essential element of commercial developments. When relevant effects of other variables
are accounted
for, this foreign owners~p
variable
has an opposite impact on the incidence of commercialization
than that suggested by the simple
bivariate result.
Also, in contrast to the earlier cross-tabulation
results, there appears to be no discernible relationship between
the realization
of commercial
benefits and firms characterized
as industrial
sector
firms. This implies that there is no reason to favor
the use of manufactu~ng
firms over service firms
in so far as commercial
spin-offs are concerned.
The probability
of a spin-off
is greater, the
larger the number of patents granted to the firm in
previous years, other variables remaining the same.
This is intuitively
appealing
since number
of
patents is often taken as an indicator of innovative
capability.
There is a negative
relationship
between the proportion
of total R&D financed by
the government
and the probability
of direct commercialization.
However, empirical
evidence also
indicates
a non-linear
relationship
(U-shaped),
where the probability
of a spin-off falls initially as
the extent of government-financed
increases, and
after a certain point (between 50 and 60 percent),
the likelihood of a spin-off increases with greater
government
involvement.
A possible explanation
is that a firm with significant
R&D dealings with
the government
may have established
a special
unit or facility for managing government
research
and bringing research results to their commercial
applications.
Finally,
the probability
of an R&D contract
realizing commercial
applications
is greater when
the contract employs private R&D resources that
otherwise
would
have
been
fully
employed

<-----Page 8----->A. Bhanich Supapol / Cvmmercia~jzation

elsewhere. That is to say, commercial utilization is
significantly
more likely when the contract bids
scientific personnel and facilities away from other
R&D activities. Perhaps the implication
is that
there will be less commercial
payoffs to government-funded
R&D when the contract is awarded
or undertaken
for the principal purpose of reahzing a more complete utilization
of private sector
R&D resources (keeping otherwise ideal resources
employed).
Neither the size of the contract, the incidence
of government
utilization,
nor the time-lag since
project completion
appear to be important
determinants
of commercial
spin-offs. With regard
to technological
areas, the results only yield weak
evidence of intermode
differences in the generation of commercial
spin-offs as intermode
dummies were significant at the 90 percent confidence
levei.

5. Summary
This paper has attempted
to identify
empirically factors that affect the co~ercialization
of gove~ment-sponsored
technologies. The results
indicate that characteristics
of the contracting
firm
and of the R&D agreement
have a significant
influence
on R&D contract
outcomes.
Perhaps
most important
is the conclusion
that there has
been a higher probability
of commercial
payoffs
associated with unsolicited
(market-directed)
projects, which inherently involve well-defined
objectives, readily identifiable
commercial merits and a
higher degree of private p~ticipation
at the project formulation
stage. Also important
is that the
probability
of a spin-off was shown to be higher
for contracts which assigned property rights to the
contractor,
all else remaining
the same. As mentioned earlier, however, this may be the consequence of the contractor’s
prior familiarization
with the technology rather than the incentive provided by ownership.
A number of extensions suggest themselves for
future research. This paper has been primarily
concerned with the analysis of factors influencing
the incidence of commercial utilization.
A natural
extension would be to examine how the commercial exploitation
of government
technologies
by
specific business enterprises affects the profitability of contractors,
entry and exit conditions,
in-

dustry concentration
ratios and, consequently,
the
general direction and rate of industrial technological advancement.
Insights
from this line of research may be highly relevant to policy-makers
and R&D practitioners.
