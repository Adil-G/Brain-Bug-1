The Usefulness of Measuring Disruptiveness of Innovations
Ex Post in Making Ex Ante Predictions
Vijay Govindarajan and Praveen K. Kopalle

Introduction

B

roadly speaking, this article addresses three
issues. First, we discuss a way to measure lowend disruptions, where the innovations are
offered at a lower price and initially attract the more
price-sensitive segments. Second, we provide a more
general measure of disruptiveness that includes both
low-end and high-end disruptions. Third, we address
one of Danneels’s (2004) criticisms of Christensen’s
(1997) disruptiveness notion that all of his examples
are ex post and that with such hindsight it is not possible to make ex ante predictions regarding a technology’s disruptiveness. Danneels also suggests that it is
one reason why established companies are skeptical
about the concept of disruptiveness.
The goal of this article is to add rigor to an important, substantive area of research on disruptiveness. A
ﬁrst step in achieving this goal is to identify ways to
measure the disruptiveness construct. We do so by
discussing ex post measures of disruptiveness and
elaborate on how we can utilize such ex post measures to make ex ante predictions about the type of
incumbents better able to develop disruptive innovations, relative to other ﬁrms. In this regard, we view
disruptiveness of innovations as a latent (i.e., unobservable ex ante), but outcome-level, variable, which
in turn is affected by organizational-level abilities. In
summary, we believe the disruptive-technology framework does indeed help us make ex ante predictions

about the type of ﬁrms likely to develop disruptive
innovations and that this framework presents fruitful
opportunities for future research.
While a lot of research has been conducted on the
design, development, and introduction of new products (Bayus, Grifﬁn, and Lehmann, 1998; Chandy and
Tellis, 1998; Dahan and Hauser, 2002; Dahan and
Srinivasan, 2000; Dahl and Moreau, 2002; Dahl and
Hoefﬂer, 2004; Dutta, Narasimhan, and Rajiv, 1999;
Gatignon and Xuereb, 1997; Green, Krieger, and
Vavra 1997; Grifﬁn, 1996; Grifﬁn and Hauser, 1993;
Hoefﬂer, 2003; Song and Montoya-Weiss, 1998;
Srinivasan, Lilien, and Rangaswamy, 2002; Urban
and Hauser, 1993), one type of innovation emerging
as strategically important is the disruptive innovation
as popularized by Christensen (1997). As suggested
by Adner (2002), Charitou and Markides (2003),
Christensen (1997), Christensen and Bower (1996),
Christensen and Raynor (2003), Danneels (2004), and
Gilbert (2003), disruptive innovations are a powerful
means for broadening and developing new markets
and providing new functionality, which, in turn, disrupt existing market linkages. Using six generations of
technology in the disk-drive industry, Christensen and
Bower (1996) advance the notion of the ‘‘innovator’s
dilemma’’—i.e., how and why incumbents tend to
ignore disruptive innovations, a key issue of strategic
importance. However, despite the importance of disruptive innovations, relatively little academic research
has been done on this innovation characteristic
(Danneels, 2004). The dearth of such research may
be because there is no appropriate measure for
the disruptiveness of innovations per se. And, as
Danneels (2004) points out, established companies
are skeptical of the disruptiveness notion, perhaps because of the difﬁculty in making ex ante predictions

<-----Page 1----->THE USEFULNESS OF MEASURING DISRUPTIVENESS OF INNOVATIONS EX POST

given the ex post nature of the disruptiveness construct. In this regard, this article distinguishes between
making predictions about (1) the disruptiveness of a
technology per se; and (2) the type of ﬁrms that may
be better able to develop disruptive innovations, relative to other ﬁrms; the focus here is on the latter.
The goal of this article is threefold. First, it adds
rigor to an important, substantive area of research on
disruptiveness by discussing a way to measure lowend disruptions, where the innovations are offered at
a lower price and initially attract the more price-sensitive segments. Second, a more general measure of
disruptiveness is provided that includes both low-end
and high-end disruptions. Third, and most importantly, it addresses a key question Danneels (2004) raises
in the context of predicting whether a technology will
be disruptive: Can the disruptive-technology framework make ex ante predictions? This article discusses
how the ex post measure of disruptiveness is useful in
making ex ante predictions about the type of ﬁrms
likely to develop disruptive innovations. Thus, this
article may help researchers conduct rigorous research
to uncover the causes of the ‘‘innovator’s dilemma’’
(Christensen, 1997) and to identify mechanisms that
would help incumbents develop such innovations.
Although Charitou and Markides (2003) argue that
not all incumbents should respond to disruptive
innovations, the focus here is on incumbents who
may be motivated to develop disruptive innovations
proactively.

Measuring Disruptiveness
As pointed out by Danneels (2004), without a reliable
and valid instrument to measure disruptiveness of innovations, our efforts at understanding this innovation phenomenon are limited. An examination of
Abernathy and Clark (1985), Adner (2002), Charitou
and Markides (2003), Christensen (1997), Christensen
and Bower (1996), Christensen and Raynor (2003),
and Gilbert (2003) suggests that disruptive innovations have the following ﬁve characteristics: (1) the
innovation underperforms on the attributes mainstream customers value; (2) the new features offered
by the innovation are not valued by the mainstream
customers; (3) the innovation typically is more simple
and cheaper and is offered at a lower price than
existing products; (4) at the time of its introduction,
the innovation appeals to a low-end, price-sensitive
customer segment, thus limiting the profit potential

for incumbents; and (5) over time, further developments improve the innovation’s performance on the
attributes mainstream customers value to a level
where the innovation begins to attract more of these
customers.
Based on these ﬁve characteristics, Govindarajan
and Kopalle (2005) consider disruptiveness of innovations as a continuous variable. In their work, a disruptive innovation is described as introducing a
different set of features and performance attributes
relative to the existing products and being offered at a
lower price, a combination unattractive to mainstream customers at the time the product is introduced due to inferior performance on the attributes
mainstream customers value. However, a new customer segment (or the more price-sensitive mainstream market) sees value in the innovation’s new
attributes and the lower price. Over time, subsequent
developments raise the new product’s attributes to a
level sufﬁcient to satisfy mainstream customers, thus
potentially attracting more of the mainstream market.
This description of disruptive innovations captures
low-end disruptions because the lower price offered
when the product is introduced appeals to the more
price-sensitive customer segment. Govindarajan and
Kopalle (2005) developed a ﬁve-item scale showing
high reliability and discriminant and convergent validity to measure low-end disruptiveness. This distinguished it from other innovation characteristics such
as radical innovations where the radicalness refers to
the extent to which the innovation is based on a substantially new technology, relative to what already
exists in the industry.
The aforementioned measure of disruptiveness is
indeed ex post; that is, one can assess the disruptiveness of an innovation only after it has been introduced
and begins to disrupt the mainstream market.

A More General Measure of Disruptiveness of
Innovations
Disruptive innovations can be high end as well, i.e.,
technologically more radical in nature (Danneels,
2004; Gilbert, 2003; Kassicieh et al., 2002; Linton,
2002; Walsh, 2002). The disruptiveness construct is
distinct from the radicalness dimension. The radicalness of innovations refers to the extent an innovation
is based on a substantially new technology relative to
existing practice (e.g., Dewar and Dutton, 1986;
Ettlie, Bridges, and O’Keefe, 1984). On the other

<-----Page 2----->14

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2006;23:12–18

hand, the disruptiveness of innovations refers to the
extent an emerging customer segment, and not
the mainstream customer segment, sees value in the
innovation at the time of introduction, which over
time disrupts the products mainstream customers
use (Abernathy and Clark, 1985; Adner, 2002;
Benner and Tushman, 2003; Christensen, 1997,
this issue; Govindarajan and Kopalle, 2004). The
radicalness is a technology-based dimension of innovations, and the disruptiveness is a market-based
dimension.
The following examples show that disruptive innovations can be both low end, i.e., technologically less
radical, and high end, i.e., technologically more radical (Bower and Christensen, 1995; Christensen and
Overdorf, 2000). Disk drives, Dell direct, Schwab’s
discount brokerage, and low-cost, no-frills airlines
like Southwest and JetBlue are examples of disruptive innovations that are less radical in nature. Digital
cameras relative to analog cameras, cellular phones
relative to wired phones, iPod relative to Walkman,
and electronic calculators relative to slide rules are
examples of disruptive innovations that are more radical in nature. In this issue, Christensen acknowledges
several examples of high-end disruptions. He says,
‘‘None of the cotton spinners made the transition to
artiﬁcial ﬁbers; no slide rule maker made the transition to electronic calculators; and Whole Foods seems
to prosper at the high end of grocery retailing, unfazed by Kroger—even though in these cases the innovations have brought better products that could be
sold for more attractive profit margins to the best
customers of the incumbent leaders.’’
Furthermore, equally compelling examples can be
found of innovations low on disruptiveness but high on
radicalness: cordless phones relative to wired phones,
DVD players relative to VHS players, gasoline engines
relative to steam engines in the earth-moving equipment
industry, and many pharmaceutical products that are
not disruptive but are radical in nature. Christensen
(this issue) provides the jet engine as a good example of
a technologically innovative, but not a disruptive, innovation: ‘‘The jet engine was a radical but sustaining
innovation relative to the piston aircraft engine.’’ While
jet technology is superior to piston technology, the customers are largely similar, i.e., aircraft manufacturers.
In summary, disruptive innovations that are also
radical can be offered initially at a higher price than
existing products but still pose the ‘‘innovator’s dilemma’’ for incumbents. Consider the following. In
the mid-1980s, AT&T engaged McKinsey for advice

V. GOVINDARAJAN AND P. K. KOPALLE

on a potential entry into the cell phone market after
investing in initial research and development work.
The consulting ﬁrm conducted in-depth market research and concluded the cell phone market was not a
profitable option for AT&T to enter, as the worldwide
market potential would be only around 900,000.
AT&T’s mainstream market still preferred the landline phone because of its reliability, cost, and coverage, and the consultants recommended AT&T pull
out of the cell phone market (Economist, 1999).
Accordingly, AT&T followed up on this advice for a
long time and continued to focus on its land-line
phone business. Over time, however, further developments in cellular technology, primarily by Nokia
(Häikiö, 2002), allowed cell phones to offer reliable
coverage at a reasonable price point, and these developments continue to disrupt the land-line phones. At
present, for example, 900,000 new subscribers typically join the world’s mobile phone services every
three days. Sixty-four percent of adults in the United
States own a cell phone, compared to .02% 20 years
ago (USA Today, 2002).
There are four reasons why high-end disruptive
innovations also create a dilemma for incumbents:
(1) mainstream customers do not value the newer performance features at the time of product introduction;
(2) the innovation performs poorly on the attributes
mainstream customers value; (3) the innovation initially attracts an emerging, or an insignificant, niche
market; and (4) whereas the disruptive product may
offer a higher per-unit margin, the perceived lower
market size makes the profit potential appear limited.
Thus, disruptive innovations can involve either
radical technologies (high end) or incremental technologies (low end). The innovation diffusion literature
suggests that technologically radical innovations primarily appeal to the early-adopter category at the
time of product introduction and over time appeal
more to the mainstream market (Rogers, 2003). However, four key aspects distinguish disruptive innovations from those that are radical but not disruptive.
First, the niche segments that initially ﬁnd disruptive
innovations attractive can be either the more pricesensitive segment (in the case of low-end disruptions)
or the less price-sensitive segment (in the case of highend disruptions); however, the early-adopter segment,
which ﬁnds the radical (but not disruptive) innovations initially attractive, is less price sensitive (Rogers,
2003). Second, disruptive innovations underperform
on the dimensions mainstream customers value,
whereas radical innovations that are not disruptive

<-----Page 3----->THE USEFULNESS OF MEASURING DISRUPTIVENESS OF INNOVATIONS EX POST

perform well on the dimensions mainstream customers value. Customers do not initially adopt the radical
innovation because of, for example, complexity, compatibility, and risk (Rogers, 2003). Third, disruptive
innovations introduce new dimensions of beneﬁts the
niche segment, but not the mainstream cutstomers,
ﬁnds more attractive. On the other hand, radical
innovations that are not disruptive focus on the
same dimensions of beneﬁts mainstream customers value (Christensen, 1997). Fourth, although disruptive innovations pose a dilemma to the incumbents, the introduction of nondisruptive radical
innovations do not pose a dilemma for incumbents,
because such ﬁrms know early adopters will eventually spread the beneﬁts by word of mouth to the rest
of the market.
Thus, consistent with Christensen’s (this issue) call
for deﬁning the disruptiveness phenomenon more precisely, the following conceptualization of disruptiveness of innovations extends Govindarajan and
Kopalle’s (2005) measure to include high-end, as
well as low-end, disruptions, provides a more general view of disruptiveness of innovations, and does not
focus on lower price/lower performance. A disruptive
innovation introduces a different set of features, performance, and price attributes relative to the existing
product, an unattractive combination for mainstream
customers at the time of product introduction because
of inferior performance on the attributes these customers value and/or a high price—although a different customer segment may value the new attributes.
Subsequent developments over time, however, raise
the new product’s attributes to a level sufﬁcient to
satisfy mainstream customers, thus attracting more of
the mainstream market.
Cellular phones, which served earlier to illustrate
the innovator’s dilemma for incumbents, exemplify a
high-end disruptive innovation. The cellular phone
initially was accepted by corporate executives who
appreciated its convenience and portability, despite its
relatively high price. When it was introduced, the
mainstream market still preferred land-line phones
because of their reliability, cost, and coverage. However, over time, further developments in cellular technology allowed it to offer reliable coverage at a price
point that satisﬁed the needs of mainstream consumers, which attracted more of them.
To examine whether the more general measure of
disruptiveness of innovations is distinct from other
innovation characteristics, such as radicalness and
competency enhancing–destroying, Govindarjan and

Kopalle (2004) collected data from 137 strategic business units (SBUs) at 23 companies. The focus was at
the SBU level within a diversiﬁed ﬁrm and is consistent with other research in the innovation area (e.g.,
Gatignon et al., 2002; Srinivasan, Lilien, and Rangaswamy, 2002) as well as with Porter’s (1985) argument
that competition in an industry is primarily at an SBU
level.
Disruptiveness of innovations was measured by using the more general description just provided in combination with the ﬁve-item scale from Govindarajan
and Kopalle (2005), and the radicalness of innovations was measured using a three-item scale based on
Chandy and Tellis (1998) and Mahajan and Wind
(1992). For measuring the competency enhancing–
destroying characteristic, three items were chosen
from Gatignon et al. (2002). Following the procedure
used by Gatignon et al. (2002), we were able to establish the reliability, convergent, discriminant, and
nomological validity of the disruptiveness characteristic as follows: (1) determining the coefﬁcient alphas
and the average inter- and intraconstruct correlations
that showed a good reliability for the disruptiveness
measure; (2) conducting exploratory factor analysis,
which established the unidimensionality of the
disruptiveness construct and its discriminant validity;
(3) conducting conﬁrmatory factor analysis, which
provided support for the proposed measurement
model; (4) establishing the discriminant validity of
the disruptiveness construct via a chi-square test, conﬁdence interval test, and variance extraction test; and
(5) establishing nomological validity by examining the
relationship between the disruptiveness construct and
the corresponding self-reported measure of commercial success, as well as differences in the disruptiveness
of innovations across industries.

Usefulness of Ex Post Measures of
Disruptiveness in Making Ex Ante Predictions
While the previous measure of disruptiveness of innovations is ex post in nature, the discussion now
turns to how such ex post measures of disruptiveness
can be used to make ex ante predictions about the
type of incumbent ﬁrms best positioned to develop
disruptive innovations, relative to others. In this regard, disruptiveness of innovations is viewed as a latent (i.e., unobservable ex ante), but outcome-level,
variable, which in turn is affected by organizationallevel abilities or competences (Henderson, this issue).

<-----Page 4----->16

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2006;23:12–18

In essence, better understanding the type of organizational abilities that would result in disruptive innovations will help make ex ante predictions about the
type of companies better able to develop such innovations. Christensen’s (1997) examples suggest incumbents excel at introducing innovations that are
sustaining but not disruptive in nature. An understanding of the type of organizational abilities necessary for developing disruptive innovations may shed
light on how incumbents can introduce disruptive
innovations. Consider two ﬁrms, A and B, with differing organizational abilities—say, willingness to
cannibalize their respective investments (Chandy
and Tellis, 1998; Tellis, this issue)—which hypothetically could have a positive effect on the disruptiveness of innovations developed at the two ﬁrms.
Assume Firm A has a higher willingness to cannibalize relative to Firm B. Ex ante, while we cannot tell
whether the innovations of either ﬁrm would be disruptive in nature, since Firm A’s willingness to cannibalize is higher than that of Firm B, Firm A would
appear more likely than Firm B to develop disruptive
innovations.
More broadly, using the previous ex post measure
of disruptiveness of innovations, we turn to the antecedents of innovations in general to make ex ante
predictions. Prior research has identiﬁed two key organizational abilities—customers and technology—
that drive innovations within companies (Abernathy
and Clark, 1985; Danneels, 2002). Historically, marketing scholars have tended to focus on customer orientation as a driver of product innovation
(Deshpandé, Farley, and Webster, 1993). That is, on
the demand side a ﬁrm’s customer orientation will
help that ﬁrm better understand and fulﬁll its customers’ needs (Danneels, 2003; Slater and Mohr, this
issue). On the technology side, researchers from the
technology management perspective have studied the
impact of a ﬁrm’s ability to understand and to
integrate technological knowledge on innovation
(Nerkar, 2003). That is, a ﬁrm’s technology-sensing
and -responding ability (i.e., technological opportunism) may aid in discovering and using new technologies (Srinivasan, Lilien, and Rangaswamy, 2002). The
variables—customer orientation and technological
opportunism—are behavioral in nature and denote
managerial mindsets; as such, they are distinct from
outcome variables such as disruptiveness, an innovation characteristic (Deshpandé, Farley, and Webster,
1993; Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Srinivasan, Lilien,
and Rangaswamy, 2002).

V. GOVINDARAJAN AND P. K. KOPALLE

To measure the aforementioned organizational
abilities, which are behavioral variables, researchers
may rely on subjective measures because prior research has provided valid and reliable scales for such
constructs. For example, Atuahene-Gima and Ko
(2001) argue that (1) perceptual measures have a
high correlation with objective measures of innovation; (2) subjective measures are better suited than
objective measures for the comparison of a disparate
set of ﬁrms; and (3) constructs relating to managerial
orientation and innovation activities are identiﬁed by
managers rather than inferred from the resource allocation necessary to implement them.
Consider the ability of an SBU to gather information on its mainstream customer needs and to respond
to such needs. Govindarajan and Kopalle (2004) argue that such a capability is detrimental to disruptive
innovations, whereas an orientation toward small but
emerging customer segments may aid in the development and introduction of disruptive innovations by
that SBU. By using a valid and reliable scale for disruptiveness, even if it is ex post, research could uncover how customer-orientation capability and other
capabilities, such as technology sensing and responding, may affect the disruptiveness characteristic.
Further, a review of relevant literature (Benner and
Tushman, 2003; Deshpandé, Farley, and Webster,
1993; Govindarajan, 1988) suggests three organizational design variables are key for innovation: incentives, culture, and structure. Using a measure—albeit
ex post—for the disruptiveness of innovations, researchers may also examine the impact of the previously mentioned organizational–design variables on
the disruptiveness of innovations. Given the uncertainties surrounding disruptive innovations, a strict,
ex ante reliance on performance measures (e.g., market size, growth rate, profitability [Urban and Hauser,
1993]) as a basis for deciding incentives for key executives in the SBU may be inappropriate. Consider, for
example, McKinsey’s low estimate (900,000) of the
potential cell phone market size. Although market
size is a quantiﬁable measure, it is still highly unreliable because market evolution for disruptive innovations is unpredictable. This implies that providing the
right environment for the development of disruptive
innovations may depend more on long-term-oriented,
subjective-based incentive plans than on short-termoriented, formula-based incentive plans for key executives. In addition, developing disruptive innovations
may require a high degree of risk taking and experimentation, and such experimentation always involves

<-----Page 5----->THE USEFULNESS OF MEASURING DISRUPTIVENESS OF INNOVATIONS EX POST

some failure. The failure could be due to lack of
knowledge about new customer needs or the inability
to change customer behavior, suggesting that the culture of the SBU must value entrepreneurship, risk
taking, ﬂexibility, and creativity to develop disruptive
innovations. It turns out the type of culture promoting such behavior is the adhocracy culture (Deshpandé, Farley, and Webster, 1993). Accordingly, it can
be hypothesized that an adhocracy culture promotes
the development of disruptive innovations at an organization.
Finally, with respect to organizational structure, one
important issue is whether separate organizational
units are needed to develop disruptive innovations relative to using the organization’s existing structure. This
issue cannot be examined if no valid and reliable
measure exists for the disruptiveness construct. In
this respect, based on Benner and Tushman’s (2003)
conceptual arguments regarding ambidextrous organizations, it can be expected that the creation of separate
organizational units will foster the development of disruptive innovations. This is because developing disruptive innovations may require new processes and new
routines, and the creation of autonomous units will aid
in breaking from current routines and processes.
Thus, given the added precision of measuring the
disruptiveness of innovations, future research would
be able to better address such issues as industry and
environmental conditions conducive to the introduction of disruptive innovations, performance implications of disruptive innovations, and managerial and
organizational capabilities that would help ﬁrms develop such innovations. In summary, while the disruptive technology framework may not help predict
ex ante if a technology will be disruptive, the framework helps make ex ante predictions about the type of
ﬁrms likely to develop disruptive innovations, thus
presenting fruitful opportunities for future research.
