<-----Page 2----->About the Working Paper Series
This article is one in a series of papers addressing one or more issues of critical
importance to the acquisition profession. A working paper is a forum to accomplish a
variety of objectives, such as: (1) present a rough draft of a particular piece of
acquisition research, (2) structure a “white paper” to present opinion or reasoning, (3)
put down one’s thoughts in a “think piece” for collegial review, (4) present a preliminary
draft of an eventual article in an acquisition periodical, (5) provide a tutorial (such as a
technical note) to accompany a case study, and (6) develop a dialogue among
practitioners and researchers that encourages debate and discussion on topics of
mutual importance. A working paper is generally the “internal” outlet for academic and
research institutions to cultivate an idea, argument or hypothesis, particularly when in its
infant stages. The primary intent is to induce critical thinking about crucial acquisition
issues/problems that will become part of the acquisition professional body of
knowledge.
It is expected that articles in the working paper series will eventually be published
in other venues, such as in refereed journals and other periodicals, as technical reports,
as chapters in a book, as cases or case studies, as monographs, or as a variety of other
similar publications.
Readers are encouraged to provide both written and oral feedback to workingpaper authors. Through rigorous discussion and discourse, it is anticipated that
underlying assumptions, concepts, conventional wisdom, theories and principles will be
challenged, examined and articulated.

Unfortunately, increasing hierarchy-control mechanisms, such as formalization, could

We found that the relationship between formalization and trust was different between
government and contractor team members. Acquisition managers must understand the

<-----Page 12----->EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Military acquisition relies upon industry for new product development, but market
organizational control is not recommended for knowledge-intensive work.
Unfortunately, increasing hierarchy-control mechanisms, such as formalization, could
reduce trust.
This research study asks: What is the appropriate balance of hierarchy-control
mechanisms and trust for an IPT in the DoD acquisition realm?
In this paper we describe the changes in work structure in major military
acquisition programs employing the IPPD and Alpha Contracting approaches. We
hypothesize that trust and control are supplementary within organizations, such that
more controls will be related to more trust. In contrast, we hypothesize that trust and
control will be complimentary across organizational boundaries, such that the more
controls the less trust. We conducted eighteen interviews and a survey in a major
weapon system program office employing IPTs, Alpha Contracting and collocation to
test our hypotheses.
Our results indicate a positive relationship between trust and formalization in
dyads within organizations, but a negative relationship between trust and formalization
in dyads that span organizational boundaries. Given the market relationship at the
organizational level between the Government and its contractor, it is possible that the
formal rules only applied within each organization, and that there were few, if any, rules
that applied across organizations.
Implications for managers include the realization that structural differences exist
in buyer-seller relationships that create different risks, rewards and trust. Equally
important is the need to develop trust without relying upon formalization, because formal
rules could reduce trust. Finally, management should measure achievement in areas
highly influenced by trust, such as government-to-contractor knowledge transfer and
system integration. Future research is needed to test such interventions.

<-----Page 14----->INTRODUCTION
The government and industry partnership is central in the military acquisition
domain—with both parties pursuing both common and separate goals based upon their
buyer and seller roles. Organizational control theory holds that in such environments of
differing goals, managers can use three types of control systems: the market, the
bureaucratic, and the clan (Ouchi, 1980). In market organizational control systems,
managers contract with and then monitor their suppliers. In bureaucratic (hierarchical)
organizational control systems, formal control mechanisms (such as rules and
regulations) are enforced through hierarchies. Workers within clan organizational
control systems self-manage using common values, traditions and beliefs. Acquisition
of new weapon systems has traditionally employed the market form of organizational
control with the industry side of the partnership, and bureaucratic organizational control
within the Department of Defense (DoD).
Given the nature of new product development, DoD Program Management
Offices typically operate in the context of relatively high asset specificity, risk aversion
and uncertainty. Although these variables have been shown by research to encourage
the switchover from market to hierarchy control, the government/industry buyer/seller
relationship precludes the adoption of hierarchical organizational control or even quasivertical integration.
However, over the last 10 years, defense acquisition has adopted Integrated
Product and Process Development (IPPD), using Integrated Product Teams (IPT) to
encourage government and contractor personnel to work more closely together to
design and build new products (OUSD, 1998). IPTs, Alpha Contracting, management
councils and other organization-oriented changes (such as collocation of government
and contractor personnel) have extended the market form of organizational control; yet,
each of these must stop short of switching over to the hierarchical or bureaucratic
organizational control form given the separation of public and private enterprise.

<-----Page 15----->The government’s goal orientation in its procurement pursuits is provided in the
guiding principles of FAR Part 1.102:
The Federal Acquisition System will—(1) Satisfy the customer in terms of cost,
quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service by, for example—(i)
Maximizing the use of commercial products and services; (ii) Using contractors
who have a track record of successful past performance or who demonstrate a
current superior ability to perform; and (iii) Promoting competition; (2) Minimize
administrative operating costs; (3) Conduct business with integrity, fairness, and
openness; and (4) Fulfill public policy objectives. (FAR, 2004)
In short, the government seeks the best possible value of goods and services for
the least cost to the taxpayer, while industry seeks to maximize profit while avoiding
competition. Fundamental goal differences notwithstanding, this partnership has
historically yielded unmatched military capability, as well as profit for shareholders.
Trust has also been recognized as a critical ingredient in modern defense
acquisition (Siemsen, 2002). Although trust is considered to be the basis of the clan
form of organizational control, scholars recently have observed that trust can be used to
extend market control and to avoid switching over to hierarchical control.
This research study asks: What is the appropriate balance of hierarchy-control
mechanisms and trust for an IPT in the DoD acquisition realm?
In this paper we describe the changes in work structure in major military
acquisition programs employing the IPPD and Alpha Contracting approaches. We
analyze the risks for client and supplier representatives in new product development
teamwork and develop hypotheses about the effect of control mechanisms—such as
formalization—on interpersonal trust. We conducted eighteen interviews and a survey
in a major weapon system program office employing IPTs, Alpha Contracting and
collocation to test our hypotheses. We analyze and report the results and describe the
implications for managers of IPTs.

<-----Page 16----->THE EVOLVING GOVERNMENT/INDUSTRY
RELATIONSHIP
New product development is increasingly undertaken in the context of inter-firm
collaboration, in which a client firm engages an outside supplier to design and/or
engineer a component, subsystem or process (Carson, Madhok, Vasrman & John,
2003). Likewise, in defense acquisition the government engages industry suppliers with
contracts to develop their new products. Because the US government is often the sole
purchaser of newly developed weapon systems, something of a monopsony exists in
which the supplier cannot sell the product to another purchaser without the
government’s consent. Similarly, once the government selects a single supplier to
develop a new technology, the supplier gains a competitive advantage over other
suppliers, creating a monopoly supply situation for follow-on procurement contracts.
Therefore, the power of buyer and seller are somewhat balanced in a situation in which
asset specificity develops and partner change entails extremely high transaction costs.
In such a situation, exit costs are high for both parties: the cost to the government of
nonperformance by the contractor is high, and the cost to the contractor of finding
another partner is very high as well.

Alpha Contracting
The government’s traditional contracting approach (before acquisition reforms of
the last decade) required successive iterations between the client and the supplier—to
discover the client’s requirements and the applicable supplier technologies—until a
relatively complete contract could be written. In Alpha Contracting, this traditional
sequential interdependency relationship has changed to a closer reciprocal
interdependency relationship in which the client and supplier work together to define the
requirements and discover solutions. Again, the Federal Acquisition Regulation gives
guidelines for this dialogue:
The Government must not hesitate to communicate with the commercial
sector as early as possible in the acquisition cycle to help the Government

<-----Page 17----->determine the capabilities available in the commercial marketplace. The
Government will maximize its use of commercial products and services in
meeting Government requirements. (FAR Part 1.102-2)
Alpha Contracting has evolved from a 1990s-era reform initiative aimed at
improving government and contractor communications in order to increase efficiency
and effectiveness. At its very foundation is a need for increased trust and teaming
toward common government/industry objectives, within the paradigm of their
buyer/seller relationship. By encouraging more collaboration early in the contracting
negotiations phase, Alpha Contracting reduces procurement costs and cycle time via
joint and concurrent processes and information flows. Key activities in the process are:
specification of requirements, preparation of the statement of work, negotiations and
executive review. Even though direct savings may be hard to quantify, most agree the
savings derived from Alpha Contracting are substantial, even if the only savings
counted is the increase in the program office staff’s time free to solve other problems
(Nissen, 1997). As Siemsen (2002) explained, the indirect benefits extend to both
government and contractor as monitoring costs of other agencies like Defense Contract
Audit Agency (DCAA) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) are
precluded. This initiative actually seeks and obtains the information that enables a
trust-based partnership. The shift from sequential to concurrent requirements definition
and design is happening in many industries, not only DoD acquisition. For example, the
construction industry has adopted the design/build approach.
In addition to collaborating on the requirements definition and contracting phase
of new product development, the interpersonal closeness developed in the Alpha
Contracting approach can be carried over to the development stage. The use of
Integrated Product Teams (IPT) encourages the government’s user representatives and
the contracting supplier’s engineers to work together as the new product is designed
and the initial prototypes are built. In some instances, the government’s representatives
and the contractor’s engineers are collocated in the same building. The potential
advantages of this increasingly close interdependency between client and supplier are
to shorten the design process, reduce development costs and, hopefully, to increase the

<-----Page 18----->quality of the resulting product. These advantages mainly apply to the government, but
the advantage to the contractor in such closer interaction might be a perceived increase
in the likelihood of winning a future competitive bid. The potential disadvantages of this
trend towards more concurrent engineering include the difficulties of achieving higher
interdependencies between everyone involved in the project, including the government
representatives and the contractor’s engineers, designers and developers.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONTROL MECHANISMS:
MARKET, HIERARCHY AND CLAN
Transaction-cost economics proposes that when the specific identity of the
parties has an important cost-bearing significance, the transaction becomes
idiosyncratic, rather than unspecialized (Williamson, 1979). Cost economies in
production occur if the supplier develops a special-purpose plant or the labor force
develops special-purpose skills in the course of contract execution. Special-purpose
skills, which can reduce transaction costs, include institutional and personal trust.
Although both buyer and supplier have long-term interests in implementing
changes through a strategy of joint-profit maximizing (meaning value to each partner),
each also has an interest in appropriating as much of the gain as possible (Williamson,
1979). Productivity benefits can result in excessive haggling, which could dissipate the
benefit of the changes to both parties. Alternatively, those changes could go unrealized
for fear of initiating an expensive conflict. The government buyer has to trust the
contractor supplier will take advantage of all potential productivity-improvement
opportunities. The contractor supplier has to trust the government client will share the
benefits from productivity improvements fairly.
Ouchi proposes three fundamentally different forms of organizational control for
dealing with the problem of obtaining cooperation among individuals or collectives—like
government buyers and contracting suppliers—who share only partially congruent
objectives. These are market organizational control, hierarchy organizational control
and clan organizational control (1979).

<-----Page 19----->Market Organizational Control and Price
Market organizational control is based upon price (Adler, 2001), which can be a
very efficient control mechanism, but the conditions for an efficient market do not always
exist. In new product development, exactly how long it will take to develop a new
technology or how much it will cost is difficult to predict; these unknowns make writing a
fixed-price contract impractical. In the uncertain conditions provided within research
and development (R&D), the government has adopted the practice of awarding costreimbursable contracts. This means that suppliers won’t compete on price alone, but on
more intangible aspects, such as their demonstrated skills, abilities and facilities; this
increased range of competition reduces the strength of the market form of
organizational control. In new product development, the client wants the supplier to
develop extensive knowledge about the technology and users—making marketorganizational control less attractive. Notwithstanding the US government’s sovereign
right to terminate contracts for cause or convenience, the government’s ability to wield
market organizational control can become limited over time by the difficulty of exiting the
relationship to buy from another supplier due to the asset specificity the new supplier
has developed. Switching suppliers will incur huge costs and considerable time due to
getting a new supplier “up to speed” on the new technology.

Hierarchy Control and Authority
When asset specificity and governance costs are high, hierarchical
organizational control, based upon the exercise of authority (Adler, 2001), has
advantages over market control (Chiles & McMakin, 1996). Hierarchical organizational
control involves control mechanisms largely based upon formalization, which is
establishing rules and monitoring behavior to ensure compliance with the rules.
Unfortunately, formalization has a large administrative overhead in writing and enforcing
rules. Also, in new product development, writing rules that cover all conditions when the
transformation process is unknown is difficult; likewise, in knowledge work such as
R&D, monitoring adherence to rules is difficult.

<-----Page 20----->Clan Organizational Control and Trust
Ouchi suggests people must be able to either trust each other (i.e. have
congruent goals) or to monitor performance (1979). Since monitoring performance is
difficult in new product development, the situation calls for the clan form of control,
which is based upon trust (Adler, 2001). Clan control relies on a “deep level of common
agreement between members on what constitutes proper behavior, and it requires a
high level of commitment on the part of each individual to those socially prescribed
behaviors” (Ouchi, 1979). The installation of IPTs, Alpha Contracting and collocation
can be seen as a move away from market and hierarchical control in the direction of the
clan form of organizational control. In order for clan control to be effective, the
organization must have or develop an appropriate organizational culture involving
higher levels of trust. Unfortunately, many managerial strategies fail due to
incompatibility with the organizational culture (Schneider, 2000).

PRICE, AUTHORITY AND TRUST IN NEW PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENT
Military acquisition of new products involves all three organizational control
systems described by Ouchi (1979). The formal relationship between the government
and the contractor is a market-based control mechanism using contracts and market
power. Once the contractual relationship is established, an IPT organization is set up,
and the government implements formal control mechanisms. When the work starts,
informal social mechanisms develop. Through the life of the project, at different levels
of organization (from the top level of contact between the government and contractor,
through the IPT structure to the individual team members), the three forms of
organizational control operate in various combinations (Ouchi, 1979).
Several studies have looked at the conditions under which each control
mechanism will be used. Some researchers propose that most organizations use some
combination of all three control mechanisms of price, authority and trust (Bradach &
Eccles, 1989; Adler, 2001). Adler proposes that, particularly for knowledge-based

Acquisition Research

<-----Page 21----->assets which form the basis for new product development, price and authority are
relatively ineffective control mechanisms compared to trust.
Gunnarson and Levitt propose that when the reduction in production savings
achieved through economies of scale in outsourcing is less than the increases in
transaction costs due to asset specificity, the firm will switchover from market to
hierarchy control (1982). New product development has two out of three of the sources
of asset specificity found in idiosyncratic transactions, including technology specificity
and knowledge specificity, but not typically location specificity. With high asset
specificity and low economies of scale, the product development organization is likely to
switchover from a market to hierarchy form of organizational control. Zaheer and
Venkatraman (1995) found that asset specificity is positively and significantly related to
greater degrees of quasi-integration. This means that new product development is
more likely to be vertically integrated than other activities.
The US military predominately out-sources its research and development of new
weapon systems; thus, it does not have complete hierarchical control over its selected
industry providers. Zaheer and Venkatraman (1995) found that trust was positively and
significantly related to greater degrees of quasi-integration. This means that the closer
the organization was to a hierarchy, the more trust developed. But Chiles and
McMackin propose that when there are higher levels of trust, the switchover from
market to hierarchy will occur later (1996). Therefore, the effects of trust can be to
extend the range of market control and delay the switchover from market to hierarchy.
This study asks: when the client organization extends the range of the market
form of organizational control in new product development, what effect will this have on
interpersonal trust between IPT members?

Trust in New Product Development
In this research, trust is defined as the trustor’s willingness to accept the risk of
relying on a trustee, even when the trustor is unable to monitor or control the trustee
(Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt & Camerer, 1998; see also Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, 1995).

<-----Page 22----->In the trust equation (Hardin, 2000), “Person A trusts Person B about X,” in which X is
the object of trust, Zolin and Hinds (2004) extended the equation to say “when Z,” where
Z is the context of trust.
Trust is considered to be essential to cooperation (Kollock, 1994) and expected
to have an impact on performance (Dirks, 1999), particularly in knowledge-intensive
work (Lane, 1998) such as new product development.
Trust is highly influenced by the perceived trustworthiness of the trustee, the
context (Rousseau, Sitkin & Camerer, 1998; McEvily, Perrrone & Zaheer, 2003, Zolin,
Hinds, Fruchter & Levitt, 2004) and the history of the relationship. Perceived
trustworthiness is the trustor’s assessment of the trustee. This multidimensional
construct is proposed to contain the dimensions of ability, benevolence and integrity.
Ability reflects the trustee’s skills and resources required for the necessary
performance. Benevolence represents the extent that two parties share the same
objectives; the trustor can trust the trustee to make decisions and act as the trustor
would in the situation. Hardin calls this “encapsulated interests” (1998). Integrity is the
trustee’s honesty in not misrepresenting the situation.
There are many dynamics involving risk (vulnerability) and trust from the
organizational to the interpersonal levels within the Program Management Office in the
IPT structure. As mentioned before, the two parent organizations may have different
economic objectives, but they agree to work together to achieve the project goals of
designing and developing the desired product within time, cost and quality constraints.
Individual team members also have different objectives depending upon their role
in the design process. For example, a design engineer could have different (and
sometimes conflicting) objectives than the government’s user representative. In the
ITP, the government personnel represent the user and have extensive knowledge of
how the product will be used in the field or what the logistical or maintenance issues will
be. The government representative’s function is to give the contractor engineer advice
on how to design the component to maximize the value to the user. The engineer’s job
is to solve the engineering problems involved in the design of a new component or in
Acquisition Research
GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS & PUBLIC POLICY
NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL

- 11-

<-----Page 23----->integration of the new component into the system. To do so, the engineer has to
understand the many constraints imposed by the function of the component and its
interaction with other components in the system. The government representative’s
suggestions could remove some constraints, making the component easier to design.
Or he/she could add new requirements, making the component more difficult to design.
The engineer has to trust the government representative in order to accept the advice.
If the government representative is wrong, the contractor’s engineer could have to do a
lot of additional work redesigning or reintegrating the component. Therefore, the
engineer must trust that the government’s representative knows the user’s requirements
(ability), has concern for the engineer’s work, won’t change the requirements without
good reason (benevolence) and will be honest about what happens (integrity).
Similarly, the government representative has to trust the engineer to listen to the advice,
to accept or reject the advice based upon a sound knowledge of the constraints (ability),
to not take the easy way out to reduce work (benevolence) and to be honest about the
situation (integrity).

Risk, Trust and Control Mechanisms
Trust is only relevant when there is risk in the relationship. In addition to the
usual risks of collaborative work—such as the free rider problem, in which an individual
shirks his or her duties knowing that others in the group will perform them (Hardin,
1971)—new product development entails additional uncertainty regarding the ability of
the design engineers to develop the new product to the client’s specifications within the
scheduled time and budget.
Trust and control mechanisms are strategies for dealing with the freedom of the
other party to take actions that may disadvantage the trustor. Because the trustee has
freedom to act, the trustor wants to reduce the amount of risk he/she is exposed to.
While a trustor may use control mechanisms, such as formalization of contracts, to limit
the size of risk or the likelihood or failure by the trustee, ultimately collaboration requires
some risk and, consequently, requires some trust.

<-----Page 24----->Das and Teng propose that trust and control mechanisms work as supplements,
rather than alternatives, to create cooperation and reduce opportunistic behavior in
inter-firm alliances (1998). Leifer and Mills define control as a “regulatory process by
which the elements of a system are made more predictive through the establishment of
standards in the pursuit of some desired objective or state” (1996, p. 117). Das and
Teng also use the concept of control mechanisms, which are organizational
arrangements designed to determine and influence what organization members will do.
If trust and control mechanisms are supplementary, they will have a positive
relationship, such that the more control mechanisms there are, the more trust will
develop.
Alternatively, some theorists propose that trust and control are complimentary. In
other words: the more trust there is, the less control mechanisms are needed, or the
more control mechanisms are used, the less trust develops. Sitkin and Roth propose
that legalistic remedies—i.e., “mechanisms that are institutionalized, mimic legal forms,
and exceed legal regulatory requirements” (1993, p. 367)—will fail to restore trust and
could lead to an “inflationary spiral” of increasingly formalized relations. They
distinguish between trust based upon ability and distrust based upon generalized value
incongruence. They propose that legalistic mechanisms are more effective in
addressing reliability issues than value incongruence. Researchers have found that
highly formalized management-control systems lead to escalating distrust when they
are mismatched to the task at hand, such as the use of precise and deterministic
measurement and monitoring in conditions characterized by high levels of uncertainty
(Sitkin & Stickle, 1996).
Organizational boundaries could influence the relationship between trust and
control. Dyads operating within the same organization could have a supplementary
relationship between trust and control because controls provide protection and reduce
the risk needed for trust. In contrast, when dyads operate across organizational
boundaries, there could be more value incongruence. We propose that dyads operating
across organizational boundaries will have a negative relationship between trust and

positive relationship.
Hypothesis 1: When the trustor and trustee belong to the same organization,
there will be a positive relationship between control mechanisms such as formalization
and trust.
Hypothesis 2: When the trustor and trustee belong to different organizations,
there will be a negative relationship between control mechanisms such as formalization
and trust.

METHODOLOGY
This research project studied a target population composed of all twenty-eight
IPT teams in an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D major defense acquisition
development program. Those IPTs contained 368 members consisting of government,
civilian, military and contractor employees. The research consisted of two elements:
qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey.
Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted onsite with 12 government
personnel and 6 contractor personnel. Interviews were voluntary and individuals selfselected to be interviewed. The growing size of the project IPT was mentioned by the
Project Manager prior to the study as a potential problem. Questions were asked about
collocation, team size and Alpha Contracting, but respondents were also encouraged to
raise their own issues and discuss what problems and solutions they perceived.
Team members were asked to complete an online survey. A non-probability
convenience sampling method was used. Team members were invited to respond on a
voluntary basis.
Respondents were asked to answer questions about their demographics as well
as questions about their relationship with the trustee. The respondents were asked to
provide information on their work relationship with four other employees chosen at

dyads.” The directional dyad is the unit of analysis. The sample size was 370
directional dyads.
Except for questions about the frequency of communication, all variables were
measured using a 7-point Likert scale from “Strongly disagree” (1 point) to “Strongly
agree” (7 points). Where a question was reversed in the meaning from the overall
direction of other questions, the result for that question was reversed (i.e., a 1 was
converted to a 7).
Trust (α = .72) and perceived trustworthiness (α = .96) were measured using
scales developed by Mayer and Davis (1999). Zolin, Fruchter, Hinds and Leavitt (2004)
proposed the questions for risk and reward and a scale for perceived follow-through (α
= .88). Formalism (α = .80) was measured on a scale developed by Hanks and
Chandler (1995). Project communication, coordination communication and personal
communication were measured by the number of times the topic was discussed per
week.

Analysis
For the 370 directional dyads, t-tests for differences in means for government
versus contractor personnel were conducted. To test for interrelationships between the
variables, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients with respective p-values.
Linear regression was used to model the relationship between the trust as the
dependent variable and the various independent variables.

<-----Page 27----->QUALITATIVE RESULTS
Collocation, Alpha Contracting and Team Size
Most individuals interviewed reported being collocated with their team members.
The general consensus was that collocation was better, making communication easier.
The positive attitude towards collocation was shared by both government and contractor
personnel, but the government personnel appeared to appreciate collocation more.
Government personnel reported that before collocation they had to make formal
appointments to meet with contractors, journey from one building to the other (several
miles) and waste the trip if the other party became unavailable. Collocation provided
the opportunity to meet informally.
The few individuals whose teams were divided between two buildings reported
that geographic distribution made communication difficult and slowed the process.
Sometimes, although the team was collocated, the respondent had to work with other
teams that were geographically distant, which caused problems. For example, a
contract team member reported that difficulties arose from not being close to the
Configuration Management team. Geographic separation was reported to increase
“stove piping,” although even those who were collocated reported this issue.
Alpha Contracting was positively received, although some contractor personnel
were not familiar with the term. Alpha Contracting was mainly associated with
collocation of government and contractor personnel.
Although several respondents mentioned they had never worked in such a large
project team, the overall size of the project was not mentioned as a problem. A problem
which was mentioned more than once was the ineffectiveness of large meetings
(described as consisting of 30 to 80-plus people). The difficulty of making decisions in
such a large meeting was mentioned by four government personnel.

<-----Page 28----->Another problem related to team size was the difficulty created by team growth.
The addition of new team members was reported to slow things down because each
addition had to be briefed on what was happening.

Problems and solutions
The onsite interviews had a higher response rate from government (11) than
contractor (6) personnel. As would be expected, the individuals who volunteered to be
interviewed had strong opinions (usually negative) about the project. Only one
respondent mentioned no problems. Respondents mentioned many of the problems
that IPTs and Alpha Contracting are designed to overcome, including lack of
communication, stove piping, and lack of integration. Problems mentioned included:
1. Stove piping, conflict, personalities, career-agenda people
2. Disrespect for top management
3. Lack of communication, coordination, cooperation
4. Schedule-driven, overly ambitious schedule
5. Micro-management
6. Lack of integration
7. Lack of discipline, lack of control and lack of strong leadership
8. Large meetings
9. Lack of training
Complaints were more often directed toward the system than individuals.
Government and contractor personnel were just as likely to criticize their own
organization’s performance as that of the other organization. Despite this, there was a
general feeling of frustration by government personnel who felt they had no control and
no way to make the contractors heed their advice, despite sometimes feeling like they
had superior training and experience to that of the contractors. Some contractor
personnel also felt the government should take more control of the situation and give
more direction.

<-----Page 29----->Many respondents complained about the IPT structure. There appeared to be
two groups: those who preferred the “traditional” structure in which the “government
told the contractors what to do” and those who preferred the IPT approach, but thought
it wasn’t being followed. The Traditionalists were the larger group and represented both
government and contractor personnel. Typical complaints by the Traditionalists were
lack of discipline, lack of control and lack of strong leadership. A typical complaint by
the IPT supporters was lack of adequate training. One government IPT supporter said:
There is no such thing as a Government IPT. The Government IPT was
created by those who refuse to break with tradition. Folks in a
Government IPT do their own thing and then talk to the contractor when
they’ve made up their minds. In a real IPT, the government is a
representative, not a lead. — Government representative
The difficulty of integration was mentioned by both government and contractor
personnel. Integration includes the need for coordination of design changes across the
IPT. One Contractor mentioned, “people don’t want to make changes, it takes more
work.”
Many of the individuals who volunteered for interviews belong to IPTs that have
to integrate across the existing IPT structure; for example, some teams were described
as Interface IPTs creating components (such as cabling) to connect system parts. If a
part changes, the cables connecting to it have to change. Besides being made to work
extra if a part changes, these individuals are not always told when something upstream
changes. Two IPTs were created by the government to represent the two prototypes
under construction and to integrate across the functional IPTs yet, these two
government IPTs weren’t reflected in the contractor structure at the time of the
interviews.

<-----Page 30----->QUANTITATIVE RESULTS
The descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1, which shows the means,
standard deviations and F-statistic for the comparison of government and contractor
personnel. Both government and contractor trustors had high levels of trust, between
which there was no significant difference (F-statistic = 2.19, n.s.). When we distinguish
dyads by both trustor and trustee (e.g., government trustor and government trustee—G
to G), the dyad type with the highest trust was government to contractor. The lowest
was contractor to government.
Government trustors reported significantly higher levels of project communication
(F-statistic = 13.87, P< .001), coordination communication (F-statistic = 7.40, P< .01),
and perceived follow-through (F-statistic = 6.46, p< .05) than contractors.

Hypothesis 1 proposed that when the trustor and trustee belong to the same
organization there will be a positive relationship between trust and formalization. Both
government and contractor trustors had high levels of trust, between which there was
no significant difference (F-statistic = 2.19, n.s.) (See Table 1). When we distinguish
dyads by both trustor and trustee (e.g., government trustor and government trustee—Gto-G), the dyads with the highest trust were government-to-contractor (M = 5.3) and
government-to-government (M = 5.2). The lowest was contractor-to-government (4.6).
Government trustors reported significantly higher levels of formalization (F-statistic =
15.39, p< .001) than contractor trustors.
To test the hypothesis, we conducted regression models for each of the different
dyad types (see Table 3). In model 2, there was a significant positive relationship
between formalization and trust among government trustors and government trustees (β
= .31, p< .05). Yet, no significant relationship existed for contractor-to-contractor dyads
(β = -.06, n.s.). This data provides partial support for hypothesis 1.

negative relationship for contractor-to-government dyads (β = -.36, p< .10). This data
supports hypothesis 2.

<-----Page 34----->DISCUSSION
Our results support our theories, which propose there is a positive relationship
between trust and formalization in dyads within organizations, but a negative
relationship between trust and formalization in dyads that span organizational
boundaries.
Likewise, market control mechanisms operating at the firm level may be
ineffective in regulating behavior at the interpersonal level.
In our qualitative results, both the government and contractors asked for more
controls, although the level of formalization in both organizations was moderate, with
government personnel rating formalization slightly higher than the contractors
(Government 4.7 and Contractor 4.15 out of 7).
In our quantitative results, formalization increased trust for government trustors,
but was not significant for contractors. In contrast, contractors’ trust was associated
with lower risks and higher rewards. These differences between government and
contractor organizations could indicate differences in organizational context or
organizational culture. More research is needed to determine the source of this
difference.
The relationships between trust and formalization that applied within the
government and contractor organizations did not apply across organizational
boundaries. Although formalization increased trust of Government trustors for
government trustees, formalization was negatively related to trust when the trustee was
a contractor. Similarly, although trust was not significant for contractors within their
organization, contractor trustors also had a negative relationship between formalization
and trust when the trustee was a government representative. This confirms that there is
a negative relationship between formalization and trust when the dyad spans
organizational boundaries.

<-----Page 35----->Given the market relationship between the government and contracting
organizations, it is possible that their formal rules only applied within each organization,
and that there were few, if any, rules that applied across organizations. In other words,
the government’s rules applied to government personnel; yet, those same rules might
not apply to the contractor’s personnel. Similarly, the contractor’s rules may not apply
to government personnel.
When the organizational control is a market relationship at the organizational
level, highly interdependent work seems to be difficult at the interpersonal level. In this
context, we found individuals experienced difficulties which they felt could be alleviated
by greater hierarchical control.
Although trust can be an alternative to hierarchical control, that trust must be built
through shared norms and values; these may not exist between different organizations
such as government and contractors.

Implications for Managers
This research does not question the basis for the government’s decision to rely
upon industry for its research and development; there are obviously good and enduring
reasons for that policy. Given that the government and an increasing number of other
organizations manage R&D through the market form of organizational control, what
more can be done to facilitate the development of quality products developed within
time and budget constraints?
1. Foremost in such contractual relationships is the realization on the part of
organizational leaders that a substantial structural difference exists,
especially in the case of government-industry (buyer/seller) partnerships.
These structural differences create different risks and rewards for team
members representing buyer-organizations compared to seller
organizations.
2. Equally important is the need to develop trust without relying upon
formalization, because formal rules could reduce trust. Alternative trustbuilding methods should be used, such as emphasizing shared goals and
values by top management and enculturation of new team members.

<-----Page 36----->3. Managers of outsourced new product development should be aware of the
symbolic impact of their actions and consider how those actions will be
interpreted by both buyer and seller representatives.
4. The client and contractor organizations should consider how interorganizational rules could be instituted in ways that would facilitate, rather
than erode, trust. For example, Positive Organizational Change initiatives
(such as Appreciative Inquiry) could identify changes in ways that avoid
the downward spiral of formalization. Likewise, an innovative approach
toward trans-organizational individual (not just enterprise) rewards might
be considered for improved motivation.
5. Program Managers should consider what teambuilding activities can be
used to facilitate the development of trust and collective identity. Although
the government has rules against the provision of benefits such as food
and entertainment, opportunities may be created for government and
contractor personnel to interact in social contexts.
6. Program Managers should bring the risks associated with lack of trust into
explicit and conscious awareness. They can ensure the government
personnel understand the problems they can cause by suggesting
changes which would be overruled at a later date. They can also ensure
the contractor engineers understand the loss they can create by ignoring
valid suggestions from government personnel.
7. Program Managers should ensure team members understand their roles.
Of particular importance is that the government representative
understands the facilitation role—as opposed to a line-management role.
Likewise, members of interfacing teams should be trained to understand
project interdependencies and how to achieve component integration.
8. Finally, management should measure achievement in areas highly
influenced by trust, such as government-to-contractor knowledge transfer
and system integration.
This study was limited by the small number of respondents. Division of the
dyads by both trustor and trustee yielded very small samples, but some statistically
significant results were obtained. Our study is also a snapshot of the situation at a point
in time, while trust is dynamic and varies over time. Therefore, we could learn more
with a longitudinal study.

<-----Page 38----->CONCLUSION
Trust is proposed as a way to extend market control of R&D and new product
development.
We found that team members representing buyers had different relationships
between control mechanisms, such as formalization and trust, than those representing
sellers. Within their organizations, buyer’s representatives had a positive relationship
between formalization and trust, but that relationship did not exist for the seller’s
representatives. When representatives operated across organizational boundaries, the
relationship between formalization and trust was negative, indicating that greater
formalization could lead to less trust.
We encourage managers of outsourced new-product development to be aware of
differences in trust and control between buyer and seller representatives in such teams.
