Abstract
How do feelings influence the effort of entrepreneurs? To obtain data on this issue, we
implemented experience sampling methodology (ESM) in which 46 entrepreneurs used their cell
phones to provide reports on their affect, future temporal focus, and venture effort twice daily for
24 days. Drawing on the affect-as-information theory, we find that entrepreneurs’ negative affect
directly predicts their effort towards tasks that are required immediately. Results were consistent
for both within-day and next-day time lags. Extending the theory, we also found that positive
affect predicts venture effort beyond what is immediately required, and that this relationship is
mediated by future temporal focus. The mediating effects were significant only for next-day
outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings on the nature of the affect-effort
relationship for different time lags.

How Do Feelings Influence Effort? An Empirical Study of Entrepreneurs’ Affect and Venture
Effort
Scholars investigating work motivation seek to understand what encourages people to
expend effort on tasks. This is an important issue for the management field because efforts
influence work outcomes (Latham & Pinder, 2005; Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002; Staw &
Barsade, 1993). A vast body of evidence shows that affect (Watson, 1988) impacts behaviors
through cognitive processes that influence how individuals prefer to act (e.g., Forgas, 1995;
Gendolla, 2000; Isen & Labroo, 2003; Schwarz & Clore, 1996). Yet, despite the potential impact
of affect on work behaviors, this factor plays only a marginal role in work motivation theories
(cf. Seo, Barrett, & Bartunek, 2004; George & Brief, 1996). Specifically, the affect and effort
link has not been clearly established, even though scholars have long recognized the importance
of effort in the work motivation literature (Latham & Pinder, 2005).
We use the affect-as-information perspective as a theoretical foundation for
understanding how affect influences entrepreneurial effort. The start-up process is rich with
affective ups and down (Cook, 1986) and entrepreneurs are often portrayed as passionate,
enthusiastic, and persistent even in the face of challenge and adversity (e.g., Cardon, Zietsma,
Saparito, Matherne, & Davis, 2008). Baron (2008) noted two reasons why entrepreneurs who
create new ventures experience strong affective reactions. First, the new venture environment is
highly unpredictable because the entrepreneurial process is chaotic, complex, and compressed in
time (Aldrich & Martinez, 2001). Second, entrepreneurs make major investments in time, energy
and effort in their ventures and often stake their personal fortunes and even their self-esteem on
the success of their ventures. Given these basic facts, it is important to investigate the role of
affect with respect to new ventures. High effort levels do often pay off for entrepreneurs and help

<-----Page 3----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort

them attain the success they desire, such as increased sales and profits (Bitler, Moskowitz,
Vissing-Jorgensen, 2005). And especially for early stage ventures, Foo, Sin and Yiong (2006)
underscore the need for an entrepreneur to persevere so that the venture has a reasonable chance
to succeed.
Our study concerning the relationship between the entrepreneur’s affect and effort is
important in several ways. First, we provide insights into how affect propels effort and these
insights are summarized in Figure 1. Although there are some exceptions (e.g., Erez & Isen,
2002; Forgas & George, 2001), existing literature on this topic generally—and somewhat
surprisingly—shows very little actual empirical research in work motivation that includes affect.
We draw on the affect-as-information model (Schwarz & Clore, 1983) to clarify the nature and
direction of the affect-effort relationship. We find negative affect predicts new venture effort.
This finding is consistent with the theory that negative affect signals that things are not going
well (Carver, 2003), and this initiates a response to try harder and increase one’s effort.
However, we also find positive affect to predict new venture effort. We extend the affect-asinformation perspective by suggesting that although positive affect signals that all is going well,
it does not necessarily reduce effort. Instead, we clarify the mechanism behind the affect-effort
relationship by showing that positive affect is linked to increased effort through a future temporal
focus.
Second, we answer the call to explore the relationship of affect to proactivity. It has been
argued that proactive behaviors, defined as anticipatory actions individuals do to impact
themselves and their surrounding (Grant & Ashford, 2008), are influenced by affective
experiences. Positive affect fuels proactive behaviors because it promotes an envisioning into the

<-----Page 4----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort

5

future (Grant & Ashford, 2008). We explicitly tested this by demonstrating the mediating effect
of future temporal focus on the relationship between positive affect and venture efforts.
Third, this is one of the first studies to show that affect matters in the domain of
entrepreneurship. In a theory paper, Baron (2008) highlighted various ways in which affect
influences the entrepreneurial process. However, these suggestions were based on extensions
from research in other contexts rather than on directly relevant empirical findings. Crucially,
since affect fluctuates even within short periods of time (Judge & Ilies, 2004; Watson, 1988), we
investigate within-individual variations of affect and effort which are dynamic constructs that
vary over time.
Fourth, we improved upon current use of experience sampling methodology (ESM) by
developing a cell phone based ESM. We adopted the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)
function and created a system whereby participants could complete their surveys through their
cell phones twice daily for 24 days. This novel use of WAP technology allowed us to scrutinize,
in real time, how the within-entrepreneur affective fluctuations are linked to variations in future
temporal focus and venture efforts.
Affective Influences on Venture Efforts
When people experience positive or negative affect, they implicitly ask themselves “How
do I feel about this situation?” (Frijda, 1986; Schwarz & Clore, 1983). It is well documented that
affect influences information processing even when the cause of the affect is irrelevant to the
current situation (e.g., Albarracin & Wyer, 2001; Robins & Denisi, 1994). However, the impact
of this information component of affect on behavior is unclear. Drawing on the affect-asinformation perspective, Carver (2003) offers insights into the affect-behavior link and suggests
that people self-regulate their behaviors to reduce discrepancies between actual states and desired

<-----Page 5----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort

6

states, and to compare current progress with the desired rate of progress (Carver & Scheier,
1990). Negative affect indicates that progress towards goals is inadequate and increased efforts
are needed to reduce this discrepancy (Carver, 2003). When applied to entrepreneurs, negative
affect might signal that progress toward current tasks is slower than desired and they should then
exert more effort working on these tasks. On the basis of the arguments above, we offer the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: For individual entrepreneurs, negative affect is positively related to
increased subsequent effort on venture tasks that require immediate attention.
Because positive affect signals that things are going well, individuals do not need to exert
more effort on immediate tasks (Carver, 2003). Therefore, we do not hypothesize any
relationship between positive affect and venture tasks that are immediately required. Using the
affect-as-information perspective, one might expect positive affect to reduce effort since positive
affect signals all is going well at the moment. However, we expect that positive affect would still
promote further actions because entrepreneurs could use this information as a signal that they can
engage in proactive behaviors. Proactive behaviors are anticipatory behaviors that individuals
take to impact themselves or their environments (Grant & Ashford, 2008). As Carver and Scheier
(1990) and Carver (2003) stated, people have multiple goals and when one goal is satisfied, they
turn their attention to other goals. We propose that positive affect influences effort towards tasks
beyond those immediately required and base this on the reasoning that positive affect heightens a
future temporal focus, and such temporal focus then drives proactive efforts.
Future temporal focus is the extent to which individuals allocate their attention to the
future (Bluedorn, 2002). Positive affect influences a future temporal focus for two reasons. First,
because positive affect signals that things are going well and that the present environment is safe

<-----Page 6----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort

7

(Schwarz & Clore, 1983; Fredrickson, 2001), it allows the individual to move beyond current
concerns to engage in more future-oriented thinking (Raghunathan & Trope, 2002; Trope &
Neter, 1994). Second, positive affect widens the scope of attention (Fredrickson & Branigan,
2005) and this wide scope of attention allows individuals to attend to possible future states
beyond the here and now (Karniol & Ross, 1996).
A future temporal focus should in turn induce proactive behaviors, and for this study,
venture tasks that are beyond what is immediately required. Grant and Ashford conceptualized
proactive behaviors as “future-focused”, “mindful” and “acting in advance with foresight about
future events before they occur” (Grant & Ashford, 2008, p. 9).” They noted that to engage in
proactive behavior individuals need to anticipate future outcomes, such as to mentally represent a
vision that could exist at some future point. Such imagining boosts motivation by increasing
people’s confidence that these outcomes will occur (Koehler, 1991) and “increases the
probability that one will act to promote or prevent these states (Ajzen, 1991); in other words,
anticipation can fuel self-fulfilling prophecies” (Grant & Ashford, 2008, p.10).
Hence, positive affect should influence a future temporal focus, and a future temporal
focus could then lead entrepreneurs to engage in venture tasks beyond what is immediately
required.
Hypothesis 2a: For individual entrepreneurs, positive affect is positively related to
increased subsequent effort on venture tasks beyond what is immediately required.
Hypothesis 2b: For individual entrepreneurs, future temporal focus mediates the
relationship between positive affect and increased subsequent effort on venture tasks
beyond what is immediately required.

<-----Page 7----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort

Lastly, trait affect should strengthen the relationships between state affect and venture
efforts. Trait activation theory suggests that traits are expressed in behaviors only when traitrelevant cues are present (Tett & Guterman, 2000). Individuals high in a given affective trait
should be more behaviorally responsive to the corresponding affective state (Tett & Burnett;
Ilies, Scott, & Judge, 2006). Moreover, Larsen and Ketelaar (1991) suggest that people high in
extraversion (which is highly correlated with trait positive affect) are more sensitive to stimuli
that induce positive affect, while people high in neuroticism (which is highly correlated with trait
negative affect) are more sensitive to stimuli that induce negative affect. Thus, we hypothesize
that:
Hypothesis 3: Trait affect will moderate the relationship between entrepreneurs’ state
affect and venture efforts such that (a) trait negative affect will strengthen the
relationship between state negative affect and venture efforts; and (b) trait positive affect
will strengthen the relationship between state positive affect and venture efforts.
The next section describes the experience sampling methodology where the affect,
temporal focus, and efforts of 46 entrepreneurs were tracked over 24 days.
Methodology
Sample and Procedures
Participants were recruited from a business incubator attached to a university in Manila,
Philippines. Fifty-six entrepreneurs from 22 start-up ventures had been admitted into the
incubator1. Of these entrepreneurs, 49 agreed to participate. Three entrepreneurs dropped out a
week after the study started, leaving 46 participants in the final sample. The sample comprised
15 women and 31 men (as we will explain, our analyses are based on 1,668 data points). The
industry categories represented were manufacturing (52%), wholesale and retail (23%),

<-----Page 8----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort

9

professional and technical services (15%), and food services (10%). Some 57% of the
participants were of Malay ancestry, while the rest were Chinese (39%) and Hispanics (4%). All
participants have a bachelor’s degree, and they had been in the incubator for about six months.
We examined entrepreneurs’ positive and negative affect, and venture efforts using the
Experience Sampling Method (ESM). ESM is a type of repeated data collection method where
participants provide in situ reports of their experiences over a period of time (Beal & Weiss,
2003). We used the cell phone’s Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) to conduct the survey.
WAP is a standardized protocol enabling mobile devices such as cell phones to the access
internet and other web-based applications (Vos & de Klein, 2002). Through wireless networks,
the WAP survey (programmed in Java language) can be downloaded and stored in the cell
phones. The survey responses are sent to a server as a text message (SMS or Short Message
Service). The system records the time when the participants’ responses were received.
Participants received 15-20 minutes of individualized coaching on how to download and
complete the survey using their cell phones. During the orientation, participants completed a
baseline paper-and-pencil survey on demographic information, trait affectivity and general future
temporal focus. They were instructed to carry their cell phones during the period of the study and
to complete the survey upon receipt of the SMS prompt. Six rounds of ESM studies were
administered every other week, with each round consisting of two SMS prompts for 4
consecutive days. Rounds 1, 3, and 5 were administered from Monday to Thursday, while rounds
2, 4, and 6 were administered from Tuesday to Friday. To avoid being too intrusive, the schedule
of the SMS prompts was randomized between 10AM to 10PM. Participants received the first
SMS prompt between 10AM - 4PM, and the second SMS prompt between 4PM - 10PM. This
time frame was selected after interviews with participants on their normal work schedules. The

<-----Page 9----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 10
cell phone survey was designed to be short enough to be completed within two minutes. Each
participant was compensated in Philippine Pesos to the equivalent of 45 US dollars.
A total of 2,232 SMS prompts were sent and 1,668 valid reports were received, yielding a
response rate of 74.73%. Following previous ESM studies (e.g., Judge & Ilies, 2004), valid
reports are those received within two hours after the SMS prompt was sent.
ESM Measures
Positive and Negative Affect. State positive affect (PA) and state negative affect (NA)
were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &
Tellegen, 1988). A 10-item shortened version was used—5 for PA (enthusiastic, attentive,
proud, interested, inspired), and 5 for NA (upset, irritable, nervous, distressed, jittery).
Shortened versions are routinely used in ESM studies to ease participant burden (e.g., Zohar,
Tzischinski, & Epstein, 2003). Since each question was only a word, the effort required of
participants was relatively low. Participants rated the extent to which each item described their
momentary affect (i.e., affect experienced at that moment) on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5
(extremely). The alpha reliability coefficients for PA and NA were .87 and .85, respectively.
Future Temporal Focus. Future temporal focus items were adapted from the temporal
focus scale (Shipp, Edwards, & Lambert, 2006). Participants were asked to indicate how well
each of the following describes them at the current moment using a 5-point scale ranging from 1
(not at all) to 5 (extremely). The two items are “I focus on my future” and “I think about what
my future has in store”. The alpha reliability coefficient for state future temporal focus was .83.
Venture Effort. Venture effort measures were adapted from the work effort scale (Bielby
& Bielby, 1988). Participants were asked to assess (since the last time they completed the cell
phone survey) the following: “How much effort did you put into venture tasks that are required

<-----Page 10----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 11
immediately?” and “How much effort did you put into venture tasks beyond what is immediately
required?” The responses were anchored by 1 (very little) to 5 (a lot). The use of single-item
scales is common in experience sampling studies (e.g., Ong, Bergeman, Bisconti, & Wallace,
2006; Williams & Alliger, 1994) because of the efforts required of participants to respond to
each survey item at multiple times.
Baseline (Time 1) Measures
Baseline measures were assessed during the orientation prior to the ESM survey. These
dispositional variables were controlled for in the analyses to partial out between-individual
effects on the ESM variables.
Trait Positive Affect (PA) and Trait Negative Affect (NA). These traits were assessed
using the full 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson et al., 1988) with general
instructions (e.g., Please indicate to what extent you generally feel this way). Each trait affect
had 10 items. The alpha reliability coefficients for trait PA and trait NA were both at .88.
Future Temporal Focus. Future temporal focus was assessed using all four items that
measure future-oriented attention from the scale developed by Shipp et al. (2006). Participants
were asked to rate the extent to which the items generally describe them using the scale from 1
(definitely false) to 5 (definitely true). Examples include “I think about the times to come” and
“I think about what my future has in store”. The alpha reliability coefficient was .80.
Self-Efficacy. We controlled for self-efficacy because it influences effort levels (Wood &
Bandura, 1989). We used the 8-item general self-efficacy measure (Chen, Gully, & Eden, 2001)
because venture creation requires capabilities in various fields (Markman, Baron, & Balkin,
2002). Participants evaluated statements such as “I am confident that I can perform effectively on

<-----Page 11----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 12
many different tasks” and “Compared to other people, I can do most tasks very well” on a scale
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) The alpha reliability coefficient was .91.
Results
Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and correlations of the study variables.
The ICC values of the ESM variables (variables 6-10) range from .38 to .56. These values denote
a nontrivial degree of non-independence and justify the use of mixed models.
Because the data comprised multiple observations of individuals over time, a mixed
model (also known as the Hierarchical Linear Model or Multilevel Random Coefficient Model)
was used to test all hypotheses. Mixed models take into account the correlated structure of the
data as multiple reports are obtained from each person. For all mixed models, all predictors
assessed via ESM were individual-mean centered to partial out individual-mean effects from the
momentary assessment (Hofmann & Gavin, 1998). The xtmixed command in Stata version 9 was
used to run mixed regression models (cf. Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal, 2005).
Tables 2 to 4 show the results of the hypothesis testing based on 1,668 ESM reports from
46 participants. In all models, we controlled for gender, trait affectivity, self-efficacy, general
future temporal focus, and firm effects. To determine the stability of the results over time, we
incorporated time effects by creating lags for within-day and next-day outcomes. On each study
day, each entrepreneur provided two sets of responses (occasion 1 and occasion 2), and these
responses were between eight to twelve hours apart. Within-day analyses were done by pairing
the predictor variables in occasion 1 with the criterion variables in occasion 2 of the same day.
For the next-day analyses in which the gap between the predictor and criterion variables was
approximately 20-24 hours, the predictor variables in occasion 1 (or 2) of the previous day were
paired with the criterion variables of occasion 1 (or 2) the following day.

<-----Page 12----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 13
Hypothesis 1 describes the relationship between the entrepreneur’s negative affect and
venture effort on tasks immediately required. We tested this hypothesis both for within-day and
next-day outcomes. Model 1 of Table 2 shows positive relationship between negative affect and
within-day effort in venture tasks immediately required (β=.11, p<.05), and Model 3 of Table 2
also shows a positive relationship between negative affect and next-day effort in venture tasks
immediately required (β=.17, p<.01). Hence, Hypothesis 1 was supported for both within-day
and next-day lagged outcomes. Surprisingly, we also found negative affect to relate positively to
next-day effort in venture tasks beyond what is immediately required, and we provide possible
explanations for this in the discussion section.
Hypothesis 2a involves the relationship between the entrepreneur’s positive affect and
effort on venture tasks beyond what is immediately required. Models 2 and 4 of Table 2 show
that positive affect and effort beyond what is immediately required were positively and
significantly related both for within-day (β=.13, p<.01) and next-day outcomes (β=.08, p<.05).
Although not hypothesized, we also found positive relationships between positive affect and
venture efforts required immediately for both within-day and next-day outcomes, and we also
provide potential explanations for this in the discussion section.
Hypothesis 2b describes future temporal focus as a mediator between positive affect and
venture effort beyond what is immediately required. The steps recommended by Shrout and
Bolger (2002) were used to verify whether mediation occurred. The first step is to establish that a
significant regression path exists between the independent variable and the mediator, in this case,
positive affect and future temporal focus. Table 3 shows a significant positive relationship
between positive affect and future temporal focus (β=.15, p<.01). The relationship of negative
affect on future temporal focus is not significant (β=-.03, ns). In the next steps, we demonstrate

<-----Page 13----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 14
that the mediator, future temporal focus, influences the dependent variable, venture effort beyond
what is immediately required with the independent variable controlled. We incorporated both
within-day and next-day lags in our analyses. Full mediation is indicated by a nonsignificant
relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable, while partial mediation is
indicated by a significant reduction in the regression coefficient of the relationship between the
independent variable and the dependent variable.
Model 1 of Table 4 shows that future temporal focus was significantly related to withinday venture effort beyond what is immediately required (β=.15, p<.01), and Model 2 of Table 4
shows that this relationship remains significant with positive affect in the analysis (β=.13,
p<.01). In addition, positive affect was a significant predictor of within-day venture effort
beyond what is immediately required when future temporal focus was included in the model
(β=.10, p<.05). Results for the Sobel test with bootstrap procedures (5,000 bootstrap samples)
indicate that 95% of the bootstrap estimates were between the values of -0.003 and 0.07 (with
bias correction incorporated) and a z-value of 1.71, ns. Models 3 of Table 4 show that future
temporal focus was significantly related to next-day venture effort beyond what is immediately
required (β=.09, p<.05) and Model 4 of Table 4 shows that this relationship remains significant
with positive affect in the analysis (β=.08, p<.05). As Table 4 of Model 4 shows, positive affect
was not a significant predictor of next-day venture effort beyond what is immediately required
when future temporal focus was entered into the model (β=.06, ns). This suggests full mediation.
The Sobel test with bootstrap procedures (5,000 bootstrap samples) indicate that 95% of the
bootstrap estimates were between the values of 0.003 and 0.04 (with bias correction
incorporated) and a z-value of 2.07, p<0.05. These findings suggest that state future temporal
focus fully mediated the relationship between positive affect and venture effort beyond what is

<-----Page 14----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 15
immediately required only for next-day lagged effort. Hence, the mediation hypothesis is
supported only for the next-day outcome.
We also found some support for the trait activation theory (cf. Ilies et al., 2006) which
suggests that individuals high on a given affective trait should be more behaviorally responsive
to the corresponding affective state (Tett & Burnett, 2003). Using next-day outcomes, trait
negative affect strengthened the positive relationship between state negative affect and venture
efforts beyond what is immediately required (β=.12, p<.01). Using within-day outcomes, trait
positive affect strengthened the positive relationship between state positive affect and venture
efforts immediately required (β=.18, p<.05) and beyond what is immediately required (β=.18,
p<.01).
In addition to testing the hypotheses, we also tested for reverse relationships, i.e., how
venture efforts impact state affect for both within-day and next-day lags. Results suggest that
exerting effort on venture tasks immediately required did not impact within-day and next-day
negative affect (β=.04, ns, and β=.03, ns, respectively). Results also indicate that exerting effort
on venture tasks beyond what is immediately required was only significant for within-day
positive affect (β=.11, p<0.01), but not for next-day positive affect (β=.04, ns). In general, the
findings were more consistent with the direction we hypothesized than the reverse relationships.
Because the two effort measures were highly correlated (r =.68), we conducted additional
analyses by using one effort type as thedependent variable while controlling for the effect of the
other effort type. Controlling for effort on venture tasks immediately required, results indicate
that positive and negative affect are not significant predictors of within-day (β=.04, ns for PA
and β=-.03, ns for NA) and next-day (β=.02, ns for PA and β=.01, ns for NA) efforts beyond
what is immediately required. However, controlling for effort on venture tasks beyond what is

<-----Page 15----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 16
immediately required, results suggest that positive affect and negative affect are significant
predictors of venture efforts immediately required for within-day (β=.12, p<0.01 for PA and
β=.10, p<0.05 for NA) and next-day (β=.10, p<0.01 for PA and β=.13, p<0.01 for NA)
outcomes. Thus, despite the high correlations among PA and NA, the analyses provide some
additional support that affect valence predicts efforts.
Discussion
The results of this study indicate that the entrepreneur’s affect does indeed play a
significant role in the process of new venture creation. Consistent with the affect-as-information
perspective, we found support for Hypothesis 1a that negative affect increases venture efforts on
tasks that are immediately required. Extending this theory by drawing on the proactivity
literature, we also found support for Hypothesis 2a, that positive affect increases venture efforts
on tasks beyond what is immediately required. Both hypotheses were supported for within-day
and next-day outcomes. Lastly, Hypothesis 2b proposed that future temporal focus mediates the
relationship between positive affect and venture effort on tasks beyond what is required. This
hypothesis was supported, but only for next-day outcome.
Our findings suggest that affect serves as a source of information for entrepreneurs. As
argued in the affect-as-information theory, negative affect signals that things are not going well
in the venture, and may lead entrepreneurs to expend more effort on venture tasks requiring
immediate attention. An unexpected finding was that negative affect also increased venture
efforts beyond what is immediately required. Because negative affect signals that something is
wrong in the venture situation, it could lead entrepreneurs to engage in precautionary behaviors
to prevent future damage to the venture.

<-----Page 16----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 17
Positive affect signals that things are going well in the venture and using affect-asinformation theory, one might expect the entrepreneur to reduce effort since all is well at the
moment. In the present study of entrepreneurs, we argue that positive affect should increase
venture efforts. It is precisely because positive affect signals that things are going well at the
moment that the entrepreneur’s focus can shift to the future, and such focus motivates the
entrepreneur to work harder because it promotes behaviors to achieve desired future outcomes
(Karniol & Ross 1996). This argument was supported because our findings showed that future
temporal focus mediated the link between positive affect and venture efforts beyond what is
immediately required (next-day lagged outcome). Although not hypothesized, we found that
positive affect also increased effort on tasks immediately required, and that a future temporal
focus also mediated the link between positive affect and venture tasks immediately required
(using a next-day lag). Striving toward desired future states involves bridging the present and the
future (Karniol & Ross, 1996). When entrepreneurs focus on the future, they may not neglect the
present, as knowledge of the present may be required to determine how one can reach the desired
outcome. To become successful in their venture pursuits, entrepreneurs should be able to
integrate the present and future time horizons (Bird & West, 1997). They must be able to make
sense of the here-and-now and the what-will-be and establish a coherent link between them
Theoretical implications
Our study helps to clarify the mechanisms that underlie the link between affect and task
directed effort. Drawing on the affect-as-information perspective, we show that the
entrepreneurs’ affect has an informational function that could influence their venture efforts.
Consistent with the arguments of affect-as-information, we find that negative affect, which
signals that things are not going well in the current situation, induces entrepreneurs to invest

<-----Page 17----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 18
more effort in the venture. We contribute to this theory by showing how positive affect, which
informs the entrepreneur that all is well with the current state of affairs, also increases venture
efforts. Our study does not contradict the affect-as-information perspective with regard to the
informational value of positive affect. Instead, it serves to extend this theory by showing that
positive affect heightened the entrepreneurs’ future temporal focus, and such temporal focus
related positively to venture effort beyond what is immediately required. This finding
demonstrates that positive affect promotes future-oriented thinking (Fredrickson, 2001) and that
future-oriented thinking drives proactive behaviors (Grant & Ashford, 2008). Interestingly, a
future temporal focus was also linked to effort on tasks that are required immediately. This
bolsters the argument that a future temporal focus may not necessarily result in neglect of the
present, since knowledge of the present and putting effort into tasks immediately required are
also necessary to determine the attainment of desired future outcomes.
Beyond our contribution to affect-as-information theory, we also contribute to the
proactivity literature by testing the link between affect and proactive behavior. Because proactive
behaviors are anticipatory and future-focused (Frese & Fay, 2001), we show how the
entrepreneur’s positive affect enhanced venture efforts through future temporal focus. Proactivity
can be considered an emotional process because it often involves “taking ego and image risks”
(Grant & Ashford, 2008, p. 22), yet the precise relationship between affect and proactivity is
relatively unknown. Our study is one of the first to provide empirical evidence concerning how
affective influences, particularly positive affect, enhance proactive behaviors. It is also important
to study proactivity longitudinally since proactivity is a process that does not occur at one point
in time but unfolds over time (Grant & Ashford, 2008). Our findings indicate that affect and

<-----Page 18----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 19
effort fluctuations are, at least in the case of positive affect, linked to fluctuations in future
temporal focus.
Recently, in examining the affect-behavior link, Baumeister and colleagues (2007)
challenged the view that emotion directly causes behavior. They argued instead that individuals
evaluate how behaviors induce emotions, and engage in behaviors to experience positive feelings
and repair negative emotions. In contrast to discrete emotions, they proposed a direct impact of
affect on behavior. Our study suggests a modification to Baumeister et al.’s (2007) theory.
Specifically, even for affect, cognition (represented by a future temporal focus in this study) also
plays a critical role in influencing behaviors.
Since affect can change even over short periods of time, the ESM approach is an ideal
way to assess the influence of affect. We improve on current ESM use by developing a cell
phone-based ESM. Though not without limitations, such as the small screen size which
necessitated short surveys, the cell phone ESM we developed has advantages over existing ESM
since it enables time stamping, allows researchers to interact with participants and monitor their
responses in real time, offers increased convenience, and improves cost effectiveness. More
importantly, ESM allows us to probe issues that would otherwise be difficult to study. For
instance, a key issue in entrepreneurship research is “How are opportunities identified?” (Baron,
2006; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). ESM which enables information on opportunity discovery
at the point in time when it occurs can offer insights into this process which other research
methods may not capture.
Limitations
Several limitations should be noted. First, our measure of affect (the PANAS) did not tap
the different levels of activation/arousal levels of positive and negative affect. Notwithstanding

<-----Page 19----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 20
this shortcoming, we decided to use the PANAS because most ESM studies on positive affect
and negative affect have used Watson et al.’s (1988) scale (e.g., Judge & Ilies, 2004; Zohar,
Tzischinski, & Epstein, 2003). We opted for a commonly used measure so that our findings can
be compared to existing studies. Future studies can use less restricted measures that incorporate
low-activation positive and negative affect and even discrete emotions to examine more nuanced
relationships among affect and effort.
Second, participants self-reported their effort levels and it can be argued that these levels
were not objectively measured. Future research can use objective or observer-rated measures of
effort to overcome self-reporting biases. Despite this limitation, this measure of effort is justified
given 35 years of motivation research demonstrating that attention drives effort (Locke &
Latham, 2002). A related concern for self-reports is common method variance (Campbell &
Fiske, 1959). Nonetheless, repeated measure studies involving within-individual analyses may
reduce this concern “because research demand characteristics are likely to weaken with repeated
measurement over time” (Williams & Alliger, 1994, p. 863). Moreover, we lagged the dependent
variables for within-day and next-day outcomes. We also conducted a Harman’s single factor test
(Harman, 1967) and this test yielded four factors (not just one) with the first accounting for
26.21% of the variance in the data. Thus, common method variance was unlikely to be a serious
problem in this study.
Third, we should only generalize the findings to short term entrepreneurial efforts, since
the entrepreneurs participated for only 24 days. Over the longer term, there can be different
relationships from those found in this study. For example, for negative affect, a curvilinear
relationship might be found. Initially negative affect may relate positively to effort, but if the

<-----Page 20----->Entrepreneurs’ affect and venture effort 21
negative affect persists, it may signal that things do not improve despite greater efforts and the
entrepreneurs can choose to “cut their losses” and disengage from their ventures.
To conclude, the findings of our research indicate that affect does indeed play a role in
the entrepreneurial process. In fact, it appears to influence significantly the effort entrepreneurs
direct to tasks important to the survival and growth of their new businesses. Given the volatile,
uncertain, and rapidly changing environments in which entrepreneurs (and new ventures)
operate, affective influences may well be of considerable importance. As many entrepreneurs
note, they have no well-developed norms, “scripts,” or rules to follow when they create a new
venture; rather, they must “make it up as they go along.” And decades of careful research
indicate that it is precisely in such situations that affect tends to exert its strongest and most farreaching effects.

We should note that an initial study was conducted to gather data on the hypotheses

outlined above. However, as noted by the Editor and the Reviewers, the dependent measures
employed in that initial study were not adequately specific in their reference to current and
future-oriented efforts. The research reported here sought to address that important issue by
developing and employing improved dependent measures. Since the methods and procedures
used in the initial study and the follow-up investigation were generally similar except for this
crucial change, we focus here only on the follow-up (improved) data set.
