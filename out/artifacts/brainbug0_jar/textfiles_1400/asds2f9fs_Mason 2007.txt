10. Informal Sources of Venture Finance

1. INTRODUCTION
One of the most interesting insights from the Global Enterprise Monitor
(GEM)—an annual international survey of entrepreneurial activity in some 40
countries—is that informal sources of ﬁnance overwhelm formal ones (Bygrave
et al., 2003). GEM’s methodology captures two sources of informal ﬁnancing:
family members (often termed “love money”) and other individuals, the latter
comprising investors who have come to be known as business angels 1 who
invest in new and young businesses where there is no family connection. Some
3.4% of the adult population in the 18 countries where information is available
meet the deﬁnition of being an informal investor. 2 They provide $196m per
year to new and growing companies, equivalent to 1.1% of the GDP of these
countries, and account for between 60% and 90% of total venture capital,
including institutional sources. In the U.S., 5% of the population are informal
investors, collectively investing $108b per annum, which is 3.5 times the amount
invested by venture capital funds in seed and start-up investments (Bygrave
and Reynolds, 2004). Most informal investment ﬂows to family members and
friends. In the 18 GEM countries, some 50% of informal investment goes to
relatives, 29% to friends/neighbors, 11% to work colleagues and just 8% to a
stranger (Bygrave et al., 2003). The proportions for the U.S. are almost identical
(Bygrave and Reynolds, 2004).
This chapter focuses on business angels who collectively make up what
is termed the informal venture capital market (in contrast to the formal, or
institutional venture capital market—see Chapter 9). The role of the family
in funding entrepreneurial ventures is an underresearched topic. However, by
deﬁnition, access to ﬁnance from family members is constrained by ties of

<-----Page 1----->260

C.M. Mason

blood and marriage, and is therefore only available to other family members.
Accordingly, it does not constitute a market. If an entrepreneur is unfortunate
enough to come from an impoverished family then this source of potential
funding is closed off. Business angels, in contrast, do invest in businesses that
are owned by strangers (as well as those owned by acquaintances) and it is quite
appropriate for an entrepreneur seeking ﬁnance to approach them for funding.
Indeed, business angels constitute the largest pool of equity capital available
for start-up and emerging companies in advanced economies (Gaston, 1989a).
Moreover, as we will see later in this chapter, they contribute much more than
just money to their investee companies.
The research base on informal venture capital is limited. Prowse (1998,
p. 786) commented in the late 1990s that “the angel market operates in almost
total obscurity. Very little is known about its size, scope, the type of ﬁrms that
raise angel capital and the types of individuals that provide it.” Indeed, prior
to the 1980s, business angels were unknown both to researchers and policy
makers. The emergence of informal venture capital as a distinct topic within
the entrepreneurship literature is therefore relatively recent. Pioneering studies
by Wetzel (1981, 1983, 1987) and others (e.g., Tymes and Krasner, 1983; Haar
et al., 1988; Gaston, 1989b) began to establish its importance in the U.S. during
the 1980s. Subsequent studies in Canada (Riding and Short, 1989; Short and
Riding, 1989), Europe (e.g., Harrison and Mason, 1992; Landström, 1993;
Mason and Harrison, 1994; Reitan and Sørheim, 2000; Brettel, 2003; Stedler
and Peters, 2003; Paul et al., 2003), Australasia (Hindle and Wenban, 1999;
Infometrics, 2004) and Asia (Tashiro, 1999; Hindle and Lee, 2002) conﬁrmed
that business angels were not just a U.S. phenomenon. 3 There is also evidence
of angel activity in less developed regions of the world, such as South America
(Pereiro, 2001). 4 While these studies are in what has been termed the “ABC”
tradition of angel research (attitudes, behaviors and characteristics), other
so-called second-generation studies have sought to develop a more in-depth
understanding of business angel investment activity by focusing on process
(Mason and Harrison, 2000a). Accordingly, Prowse’s (1998) claim is no longer
valid. Nevertheless, both the body of literature on informal venture capital and
the number of active researchers remain small in comparison to the amount of
scholarly activity that is devoted to investigating institutional venture capital.
This is despite the much greater role of informal venture capital in funding
the start-up and initial growth of entrepreneurial ventures. 5 A further limitation
is that much of the research lacks theoretical foundations and simply reports
survey ﬁndings. Only by attracting more scholarly effort and producing research
that is theoretically informed will informal venture capital lose this Cinderella
status.
This chapter adopts a supply-side perspective. This reﬂects the focus
of the overwhelming majority of the literature on this topic which is largely

<-----Page 2----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

261

concerned with who business angels are, what motives them and how they
invest. By way of contrast, there is very little literature that takes a demandside perspective, looking at informal venture capital from the viewpoint of the
entrepreneur. The chapter is structured as follows. The next section provides an
overview of the ‘ABC’ of angels. Section 3 reviews the economic importance of
business angels, highlighting the nature of their investments and the size of the
market. This is followed in Section 4 by a brief discussion of government efforts
to expand the supply of informal venture capital. Section 5 adopts an investment
process perspective. Section 6 examines the emergence of new organizational
formats for angel investing. The concluding section offers some thoughts on
future research possibilities.

2. THE INFORMAL VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET: AN OVERVIEW
The informal venture capital market comprises business angels who
are conventionally deﬁned as high net worth individuals who invest their own
money, along with their time and expertise, directly in unquoted companies in
which they have no family connection, in the hope of ﬁnancial gain. Several
aspects of this deﬁnition need to be highlighted in order to emphasize the
distinctiveness of business angels as a type of investor.
High net worth. Having wealth is a prerequisite for becoming a business
angel. Business angels invest upward of £10,000 per deal (sometimes in excess
of £100,000) and typically have a portfolio of two to ﬁve investments (some
angels have more). However, they are not investing their entire savings in this
way. Because of the high risk of investing in unquoted companies, most angels
allocate just 5%–15% of their overall investment portfolio to such investments.
Thus, if these investments fail, as they often do, the losses will not affect their
lifestyle. Some rather dated evidence on the wealth of angels suggests that they
tend to be “comfortably” off rather than super-rich. Gaston (1989b) reported
that one in three business angels in the U.S. had a net worth (excluding principal
residence) in excess of $1 million. There were also “very few” millionaires in
the study by Haar et al. (1988). Mason and Harrison (1994) noted that only 19%
of U.K. business angels were millionaires.
Investing their own money. The fact that angels are investing their own
money distinguishes them from institutional venture capital funds whose investment funds come from such sources as pension funds, banks and foundations
and, as a result, have a legal duty of care for how they invest such funds.
First, business angels do not have to invest if they do not ﬁnd appropriate
investments, whereas venture capital funds have a ﬁxed life, typically ten years,
over which the fund must invest and exit. Second, they can make quicker
investment decisions (Freear et al., 1995). Third, angels have less need for

<-----Page 3----->262

C.M. Mason

specialist ﬁnancial and legal due diligence, so the costs for the investee business
are lower. Fourth, business angels can adopt idiosyncratic investment criteria
whereas venture capital funds have raised their investment funds to invest in
speciﬁc types of businesses and so must follow these investment criteria when
investing.
Direct. Business angels make their own investment decisions as opposed to investing in some form of pooled investment vehicle in which the
investment decisions are made by fund managers. This implies that those people
who become business angels have both the personal networks that will provide a
ﬂow of investment opportunities and the competence to undertake the appraisal
of new and young entrepreneurial companies. Indeed, a consistent theme in
the literature is that the majority of business angels are successful, cashed-out
entrepreneurs, while the remainder either have senior management experience
in large businesses or have specialist business expertise (e.g., accountant). On
account of these backgrounds, such individuals have access to deal ﬂow and
the competence to make investment decisions. Becoming a business angel is
therefore a way for such individuals to recapture their successful experience,
making investments based on the analytical skills and intuition that they have
developed in business. This reinforces their self image and sustains recognition
in the communities in which they live (Margulis and Benjamin, 2000). However,
it is fair to say that competence levels among business angels is variable, and a
career as a successful entrepreneur, or in a senior position in a large company,
does not necessarily provide an individual with all of the skills required to be a
successful business angel. Angels report in surveys (Sørheim, 2003) that their
initial investments involved a steep learning curve.
Time and expertise. Part of the investment approach of business angels
involves the support their investee businesses through a variety of handson roles, including mentoring, the provision of strategic advice, networking
and in some cases direct involvement in a speciﬁc functional capacity. This
has prompted the description of informal venture capital as being “capital
and consulting.” The opportunity to be involved with a business start-up is a
signiﬁcant motive for business angels. Involvement also reduces information
asymmetries and moral hazard and so is a means of risk reduction.
Unquoted companies. Business angels are investing in unquoted companies as opposed to companies that are listed on a stock market. As we will
see more clearly in the next section, while angels invest in all sorts of situations,
including management buyouts and buy-ins and rescue/turnaround situations,
their typical investment is in a new or recently started business. The key point
here is that business angels want to be active investors in the companies in which
they invest, helping them to grow, whereas stock market investing is passive.
Financial gain. Business angels are investing in the hope of achieving
a ﬁnancial return, typically in the form of a capital gain that is accomplished

<-----Page 4----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

263

through some form of harvest event such as an acquisition of the investee
company or an IPO. However, psychic income is also an important motivation.
Studies are consistent in identifying that the fun and enjoyment that is derived
from such investments is an important subsidiary reason for becoming a
business angel. This links back to an earlier point: business angels are also
characterized as being hands-on investors. The ability to provide support to
investee companies reinforces the tendency for business angels to have a
business background. Some angels also express altruistic motives. Paul et al.
(2003) quoted one Scottish angel as follows: “don’t get me wrong, I want to
make money. But I’ve done well out of Scotland and I’d like to help others
to do the same.” U.S. evidence indicates that most business angels would
be willing to forego some ﬁnancial return either to invest in businesses that
were seen as socially beneﬁcial (Sullivan, 1994) or simply to support new
entrepreneurs (Wetzel, 1981). Evidence of altruistic motives is much weaker
in other countries.
One of the striking features in the literature is the remarkable consistency in the characteristics of business angels across countries. Japan is the only
country where research suggests that angels have a distinctively different proﬁle
(Tashiro, 1999). The proﬁle of the typical business angel is characterized as
follows:
• Male. Studies in various countries are consistent in ﬁnding that upward of
95% of business angels are male. This can be attributed to the relatively
small numbers of women who have built successful entrepreneurial companies or hold senior positions in large companies. However, the small
minority of women who are business angels have similar characteristics
to those of their male counterparts (Harrison and Mason, 2005).
• In the 45–65 year age group. This reﬂects the length of time required to
build signiﬁcant personal net worth, the greater amount of discretionary
wealth of this age group as their children cease to become ﬁnancially
dependent on them, and the age at which people with a successful business career might chose, or be forced to, disengage. Becoming a business
angel is often a way in which such individuals to remain economically
active. For example, cashed out entrepreneurs in their 40s or 50s often
report that they became business angels because they quickly became
bored by a life of leisure—as one angel noted, “the attractions of playing
golf seven days a week quickly palls.” There are some international
differences. Angels are slightly younger in the U.S. and slightly older
in Nordic countries (Landström, 1993). Recent studies hint that business
angels may be becoming slightly younger (e.g., Infometrics, 2004). This
may be linked, at least in part, to the acquisition frenzy of the closing

<-----Page 5----->264

C.M. Mason

years of the technology boom of the late 1990s which enabled a lot of
younger entrepreneurs to cash-out.
• Successful cashed-out entrepreneurs. Most business angels have had
experience of business start-up and growth. As Freear et al. (1992,
p. 379) noted, this implies that many angels “have acquired the kind
of experience. . .that it takes to start, manage and harvest a successful
entrepreneurial venture. In a sense their entire professional careers have
prepared them to conduct the due diligence necessary to evaluate the
merits and risks of prospective investments and to add value of their
know how to the ventures they bankroll.” The remainder are typically
either people who have held senior positions in large companies or have
specialist commercial skills and are involved in working with entrepreneurial companies (e.g., accountants, consultants, lawyers) and whose
wealth is derived from high income. It is also important to emphasize
that non-business professionals (e.g., doctors, dentists) and public sector
employees are conspicuous by their absence from the ranks of business
angels (Gaston, 1989b).
• Well educated. Economic success is underpinned by a high level of
education. Business angels typically have a university degree and/or professional qualiﬁcations. However, angels with PhDs are rare. This reﬂects
other research that suggests that the relationship between education and
entrepreneurship is an inverted U-shape (i.e., both too little and too much
education is a hindrance to entrepreneurial behaviors) (Reynolds, 1997).
There have been surprisingly few attempts to compare business angels
with noninvestors. Lindsay (2004) found that angels score more highly on
measures of entrepreneurial orientation—pro-activeness, innovativeness, risktaking strategies—which, in turn, suggests that they act in an entrepreneurial
manner in undertaking their investment activities. However, this might simply
reﬂect the entrepreneurial background of most business angels. Duxbury et al.
(1996) suggested that angels are distinctive from non-investors in terms of
their psychological traits, with an internal locus of control, very high need for
achievement (nAch), a moderately high need for afﬁliation and autonomy and
are intrinsically motivated. But here again these are also entrepreneurial traits.
This proﬁle masks considerable heterogeneity in the business angel
population, not so much in terms of their demographics, but rather in their
motivation and investment focus. The most basic distinction is between active
angels—those individuals with experience of investing and who are continuing
to look for investments, latent angels—inactive investors who have made
investments in the past, and virgin angels—individuals who are looking to invest
but have yet to make their ﬁrst investment (Coveney and Moore, 1998).

Note: based on a survey of “nearly 500 business angel investors/potential investors . . . and 467 actual
investment deals involving a total level of funds of more than £50 million” (Coveney and Moore, 1998:
8). However, the methodology for classifying investors is not explained.

There are several classiﬁcations of active investors. Gaston (1989b)
identiﬁed ten distinct types of business angel but without elaborating on
the methodological basis for the classiﬁcation. Coveney and Moore (1998)
identiﬁed three types of business angel based on their level of entrepreneurial
activity and intensity of investment activity (see Table 10-1):
• Entrepreneur angels: the most active in terms of number of investments
and amount invested, the most experienced angels and also the most
wealthy. Their preference is to invest at start-up and enjoyment is a
major motivation. Their key investment criterion is the personality of
the entrepreneur. Entrepreneur angels are also the most open to investing
outside of their own ﬁeld of experience. They are unlikely to play a role
in the day-to-day management of their investee companies.
• Income seeking angels: signiﬁcantly less wealthy investors, less active
and less motivated by fun and enjoyment considerations, tend to invest
in industries in which they are familiar and looking for a formal management role in the ventures which they ﬁnance.
• Wealth maximizing angels: predominantly self-made investors but includes some with inherited wealth, interested primarily in the ﬁnancial
return, more likely to invest in industries in which they have personal
experience and more likely to take a full-time position in their investee
businesses.
Sørheim and Landström (2001) used cluster analysis to differentiate
Norwegian business angels in terms of their competence and investment activity.
This produces four distinct types of business angel (Table 10-2):

Based on a sample of 425 “informal investors.”

• Lotto investors (30%): low investment activity level and limited experience of starting and running businesses. They make very few investments
and have limited ability to add value to their investments.
• Traders (24%): high investment activity but limited experience of starting
and running entrepreneurial businesses. They are keen to invest but have
limited ability to add value.
• Analytical investors (21%): low level of investment activity but possess
fairly high competence.
• Business angels (25%): very high level of investment activity and high
competence.
From a demand-side perspective these studies underline the differentiated nature of the supply of informal venture capital. Clearly, “not everybody’s
money is green.” The implication for entrepreneurs is that they must ensure that
the type of business angel who is offering to invest is both willing and capable
of contributing the value-added that they require.
Other studies have focused on speciﬁc types of business angel. Kelly
and Hay (1996, 2000) focused on the most active investors who account for a
disproportionate amount of investment activity. They note that such angels are
more ﬁnancially driven and formalized in their approach, which they suggest
reﬂects their experience of living through unforeseen problems and obstacles.
Visser and Williams (2001) examined “takeover and turnaround artists”—
business angels who specialize in investing in distressed companies with the
aim of turning them around to start on a growth path again. 6 As they note,
these investors are “performing the same function as . . . other types of business
angels. . . —breathing new life into a business—but at the other end of the

<-----Page 8----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

267

business spectrum—when the business is about to die” (Visser and Williams,
2001, p. 2).

3. THE ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INFORMAL VENTURE
CAPITAL MARKET
The informal venture capital market is recognized as playing a vital role
in economic development at both national and local/regional scales. Indeed,
one U.K. government report argued that “an active informal venture capital
market is a pre-requisite for a vigorous enterprise economy. . .” (ACOST, 1990,
p. 41). There are three aspects of the informal venture capital market which are
signiﬁcant from an economic development perspective.
First, the amount of ﬁnance that business angels have invested, or have
available to invest, is signiﬁcant. Unfortunately, it is impossible to be precise
about the number of business angels, the number of investments made and
the amount invested. This is because there is no obligation for business angels
to identify themselves or register their investments. Indeed, the vast majority
of business angels strive to preserve their anonymity and are secretive about
their investment activity, not least to avoid being inundated by entrepreneurs
and other individuals seeking to persuade them to invest or provide ﬁnancial
support for other causes (Benjamin and Margulis, 2000). Thus, all measures
of the size of the informal venture capital market are fairly crude estimates.
Gaston (1989a) estimated that in the U.S. business angels invest 13 times more
dollars than venture capital funds and make 40 times more investments. A
more up-to-date estimate by Sohl (2003) suggested that there are 300,000–
350,000 business angels in the U.S., investing approximately $30 billion per
annum in close to 50,000 ventures. Venture capital funds, in contrast, invest
$30–$35 billion in fewer than 3,000 entrepreneurial ventures. The equivalent
estimate for the U.K. is 20,000–40,000 business angels investing £0.5 billion—
£1 billion per annum in 3,000–6,000 companies. They make eight times
as many investments in start-up companies as venture capital funds (Mason
and Harrison, 2000b). However, these calculations of the amounts invested
by business angels are an underestimate of the size of the informal venture
capital market. First, most business angels have further funds available to
invest (Coveney and Moore, 1998; Mason and Harrison, 1994, 2002a) but
cannot identify appropriate investment opportunities. This uncommitted capital
is substantial: one study reported that it exceeded the amount invested by the
respondents in the three years prior to the survey (Mason and Harrison, 2002a).
Second, there is a substantial pool of potential, or virgin, business angels who
share the characteristics of active angels but have not entered the market (Freear
et al., 1994a; Coveney and Moore, 1998). However, with appropriate forms

<-----Page 9----->268

C.M. Mason

of support—such as help with deal ﬂow and with the technical aspects of
investing—they could be encouraged to enter the market (Mason and Harrison,
1993; Freear et al., 1994a). Sohl (1999) estimated that these potential angels
exceed the number of active investors by a factor of ﬁve to one.
The economic signiﬁcance stems from where this capital is invested.
Finance from business angels occupies a crucial place in the spectrum of
ﬁnance available to growing businesses. In terms of size of investment, business
angels invest in what is often termed (at least in Europe) the “equity gap,”
providing amounts of ﬁnance that are beyond the ability of entrepreneurs
to raise from their own resources and from family and below the minimum
investment threshold of venture capital funds 7 —a ﬁgure that is in excess of
£1m in the U.K. and $5m in the U.S. (Sohl, 2003). Business angels, investing
on their own or in small ad hoc groups, will typically invest up to £100,000,
or even £250,000, while the larger angel syndicates (see Section 6) will make
investments of £500,000 and above. This is usually provided in the form of
equity or a combination of equity plus loans. However, all-loan investments are
by no means unusual. 8 In terms of stage of business development, investments
by business angels are skewed toward the seed, start-up and early growth stages
whereas venture capital funds focus on later stage deals. The role of business
angels in seeding new ventures has become even more critical in recent years
as institutional venture capital funds in North America and Europe have raised
their minimum investment size and continued to shift their investment focus to
later stage investments (Jensen, 2002; Sohl, 2003).
The second factor which underpins the economic signiﬁcance of the informal venture capital market is the hands-on involvement of business angels in
their investee businesses. Demand-side studies indicate that many entrepreneurs
are seeking “smart money” and for this reason business angels are valued ahead
of other funding sources (Cressy and Olofsson, 1997; Lindström and Olofsson,
2001; Sætre, 2003). It has already been noted that business angels derive
considerable psychic income from this involvement. Their entrepreneurial and
business backgrounds have also been highlighted. Further discussion of the
nature of this involvement can be found in Section 5: sufﬁce to say at this
point that it ranges from informal coaching, mentoring and advice to Board
participation. Business angels typically invest in industries and markets with
which they are familiar. As a consequence, the entrepreneurs who are funded
by business angels derive consider value from the expertise, knowledge and
experience that their investors pass on through this hands-on involvement. This,
in turn, increases the prospects for the success of their businesses. Indeed,
entrepreneurs often report that the hands-on involvement of business angels is
more valuable than the capital that they have received. However, hard evidence
on the impact of this involvement on business performance remains elusive.

<-----Page 10----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

269

The informal venture capital market and the institutional venture capital
market can therefore be seen as playing complementary roles in supporting
entrepreneurial activity. This is evident in terms of the size and stage of
investments made by business angels and venture capital funds (Freear and
Wetzel, 1990). Harrison and Mason (2000) highlighted other forms of complementarity in the form of information sharing, co-investing and sequential
investing and note signiﬁcant collaboration in these areas between business
angels and venture capital funds in the U.K. However, they also highlight
the frequent tensions that arise from the different motives and expectations of
angels and fund managers, the bureaucracy of venture capital funds and the
unequal power relationship between angels and funds. Mason (2006) suggested
that this relationship may have deteriorated during the post-2000 technology
downturn. 9 The importance of business angels in providing a deal ﬂow for
venture capital funds is highlighted by Madill et al. (2005) who noted that 57%
of technology ﬁrms in Ottawa who had received funding from angels went on to
raise institutional venture capital, compared with only 10% of ﬁrms which did
not raise any angel investment. It is therefore clear that a thriving institutional
venture capital market requires a healthy informal venture capital market,
and vice versa. Policy-makers often fail to appreciate these connections and
focus their intervention on the institutional venture capital market. But as this
discussion makes clear, the impact of such interventions will be compromised
if the informal venture capital market is under-developed.
A third contribution of informal venture capital to economic development arises from its geographical characteristics. This has two dimensions.
First, “angels live everywhere” (Gaston, 1990, p. 273). Gaston’s US research
suggests that the proportion of business angels in the adult population is fairly
constant at around four angels in every 1000 adults. Certainly, research has
documented the presence of business angels in various economically lagging
regions such as Atlantic Canada (Feeney et al., 1998; Farrell, 1998; Johnstone,
2001) where institutional sources of venture capital are largely absent. 10
Second, various studies indicate that the majority of investments by business
angels are local. This reﬂects both the localized nature of their business and
personal networks through which they identify most of their investments (see
Section 5) and their hands-on investment style and consequent need for frequent
contact with their investee businesses. Two implications follow. First, in most
areas outside of major ﬁnancial centers and technology clusters business angels
are the only source of risk capital (Gaston, 1989b). Second, the informal venture
capital market is an important mechanism for retaining and recycling wealth
within the region that it was created.
Informal venture capital also plays an important role in the emergence
of technology clusters. This issue has attracted little explicit attention in
the literature. However, it is obvious that nascent technology clusters lack

<-----Page 11----->270

C.M. Mason

indigenous sources of institutional venture capital do not have the visibility
and track record to interest venture capitalists in other cities and regions.
Thus, the only source of risk capital available to technology entrepreneurs in
such clusters is likely to be business angels, although, of course, they will
have made their money in different (and probably mature) industries and so
need to be willing to take a “punt” on businesses operating in industries that
they do not understand. This was the case in the Ottawa technology cluster
where the ﬁrst generation of technology start-ups in the 1960s and 1970s were
funded by business angels from traditional sectors (Mason et al., 2002). Once a
technology cluster develops some momentum successful cashed-out technology
entrepreneurs play a critical role in providing initial funding, hands-on support
and credibility to the next generation of technology-based ﬁrms, grooming them
for subsequent investment by venture capital funds which, by this stage in the
cluster’s development are now actively investing in the cluster’s businesses.
Silicon Valley, Cambridge, U.K. as well as Ottawa all provide good examples
of this process.

4. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THE INFORMAL VENTURE
CAPITAL MARKET
This evidence on the economic signiﬁcance of the informal venture
capital market has prompted governments at national and state/regional scales
to develop initiatives to increase investment activity by business angels. These
initiatives have taken two main forms. First, evidence from early studies that
business angels and entrepreneurs were incurring high search costs in trying,
often unsuccessfully, to ﬁnd one another on account of the fragmented nature of
the market and invisibility of angels (Wetzel, 1987; Mason and Harrison, 1994),
prompted the establishment of business angel networks (BANs). The function
of these organizations—which can be thought of as being similar to “dating
agencies”—is to enable entrepreneurs seeking ﬁnance to come to the attention
of business angels and at the same time enable business angels to receive information on investment opportunities (ﬁltered to meet their investment criteria if
desired) without compromising their privacy (Mason and Harrison, 1996a). The
pioneering BANs, such as Venture Capital Network (VCN) in New England
(Wetzel and Freear, 1996) and Canada Opportunities Investment Network
(COIN) in Canada (Blatt and Riding, 1996) that were established in the 1980s
offered computer matching services which were intended to ensure that angels
only received details of investment opportunities that matched their investment
criteria. COIN started as an Ontario initiative but was extended across Canada.
In the U.S., ACE-NET was created in the 1990s to enable investors to use the
Internet to search for opportunities in all local/state BANs across the country

<-----Page 12----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

271

(Acs and Prowse, 2001). U.K. and continental European BANs, in contrast,
have been established using investment bulletins and investment forums as their
main matching mechanisms. Here again there have been attempts to forge local
BANs into a national marketplace (e.g., by the U.K.’s National Business Angel
Network).
BANs have received a mixed assessment. Harrison and Mason (1996)
were positive about the early impact of pilot BANs in the U.K., arguing
that they had mobilized capital that would otherwise have remained invisible
and promoted a relatively signiﬁcant number of investments which, in turn,
unlocked bank lending. Entrepreneurs have also beneﬁted from advice and
signposting to more appropriate sources of assistance, feedback from investors
to whom they were introduced but did not invest, while there have been wider
beneﬁts in terms of the education of entrepreneurs, investors and intermediaries
and a general raising of awareness about equity. However, other evidence from
the U.K. and Canada reveals mixed satisfaction with BANs among investors.
Many investors report that BANs have failed to provide them with a superior
quality of investment opportunities. Certainly, they have been a marginal source
of investments for most angels (Blatt and Riding, 1996; Mason and Harrison,
1996b, 1999). The case for the public subsidization of BANs (Mason and Harrison, 1995) has also been challenged in the light of the willingness of private
sector businesses to offer matching services. However, Mason and Harrison
(1997) argued that publicly supported BANs are operating in a different part of
the market than commercially oriented BANs which focus on bigger, and often
later stage, investments which are able to support their fees. Meanwhile attempts
in the U.K., Canada and the U.S. to create national BANs have failed on account
of the strong local/regional nature of investment activity (Blatt and Riding,
1996). There is now a growing consensus that BANs need to refocus away
from pure ﬁnancial intermediation to a broader approach which emphasizes the
education of participants in the market (Wetzel and Freear, 1996; Mason and
Harrison, 1999, 2002a; Lange et al., 2002; San José et al., 2005).
Second, governments have created schemes that provide business angels with tax incentives in order to improve the risk-reward balance of investing
in early stage businesses. Business angels are undoubtedly sensitive to levels of
tax which is one of the few macro-economic factors that has a signiﬁcant effect
on encouraging or discouraging their investment activity (Mason and Harrison,
2000c). The U.K.’s Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) enables investors who
make investments which qualify under the scheme’s rules to write-off the
amount invested against income tax. In addition, capital gains are not subject
to tax, losses can be offset against tax and, perhaps most useful of all, tax that
is liable on capital gains from any type of investment can be deferred if part
or all of this gain is invested using the EIS. A recent evaluation of the EIS
has suggested that additionality is over 50% (i.e., at least half of the monies

<-----Page 13----->272

C.M. Mason

would not have been invested by these investors in the absence of the scheme)
and that companies also beneﬁted in terms of attracting investors who also
provided business advice and expertise (Boyns et al., 2003). Several US states
also offer business angels tax incentives (Lipper and Sommer, 2002). However,
it is important to stress that business angels do not take the availability of tax
incentives into account when evaluating speciﬁc investments, although this will
inﬂuence how the investment is structured. For example, investments have to be
in ordinary shares in order to qualify for EIS relief, even though current best
practice suggests that preference shares may be a more appropriate investment
instrument.
These initiatives have been supplemented by amendments to securities
legislation which control the promotion of share issues in order to provide
investor protection. Firms wishing to raise ﬁnance from the general public are
required to produce a prospectus which has been approved by an authorized
organization to ensure that they are not potentially misleading. However, the
costs involved are too high for the typical fund-raising exercise. This is no
longer necessary in several countries, such as the U.S., Australia and, most
recently, the U.K., if the offer is promoted to self-certiﬁed high net worth
individuals or sophisticated investors who give up certain legal protections and
channels of legal redress to receive investment opportunities (HM Treasury,
2004a, b). BANs in the U.K. have been exempt from the regulations concerning
the promotion of investments for some time (Clarke, 1996).
However, in the light of recent evidence that business angels continue
to be opportunity constrained despite being members of BANs (Mason and
Harrison, 2002a), it is now recognized that there are also demand-side barriers to
investment. A lot of businesses looking for investment from business angels are
not investment ready, with missing information in the business plan (e.g., competitor analysis) and poorly developed ideas about the business model, markets,
route to market and unrealistic expectations about investor requirements (e.g.,
involvement) (Feeney et al., 1999; Mason and Harrison, 2001, 2004a). These
deﬁciencies are often accompanied by poor presentation (Mason and Harrison,
2003). Accordingly, recent interventions have sought to address the issue of
“investment readiness” (Mason and Harrison, 2001). There are examples of
investment ready programs in Canada (Industry Canada, 2001) and the U.K.
(SQW, 2004). An alternative approach of investment facilitation is discussed by
Mason and Harrison (2004a).
The most recent form of initiative is co-investment schemes. This has
been prompted by the post-2000 venture capital investment downturn which
followed the collapse of the technology bubble of the late 1990s. The response
of venture capital ﬁrms was to cut back on making new investments in order
to focus their attention on the businesses in their existing portfolios. The consequence for business angels was that they were unable to pass on those businesses

<-----Page 14----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

273

in their portfolios to venture capital funds for follow-on investments and so had
to do more follow-on investments themselves. This meant that they had less
money and time available to make new investments. Co-investment schemes
have addressed this liquidity constraint by matching angel investments with
public money on a one-to-one basis up to a maximum ﬁgure. Angels have also
co-invested alongside technology programs such as SBIR and the Advanced
Technology Program in the U.S. (Chang et al., 2002) and SMART in the U.K.
which provide grants to technology companies to make the transition from the
laboratory to the market place. These schemes are particularly attractive to
business angels. First, the funds provide a means of risk sharing. Second, the
competitive peer review process by technology and business experts provides
an independent source of assessment which assists in the due diligence process
(Sohl, 2003).

5. THE INVESTMENT PROCESS
The aim of the early studies of the informal venture capital market
was, in the words of William Wetzel Junior, the pioneer of the ﬁeld, “to put
boundaries on our ignorance” (Wetzel, 1986, p. 132) by generating insights into
the characteristics of business angels and their investment activity. In contrast,
‘second generation studies’ have focused on the investment process (Mason and
Harrison, 2000a). Following Riding et al. (1993) and Haines et al. (2003) a
number of discrete stages can be identiﬁed (see Table 10-3):
• Deal origination.
• Deal evaluation: this can, in turn, be sub-divided at least two sub-stages:
◦ initial screening,
◦ detailed investigation.
• Negotiation and contracting.
• Post-investment involvement.
• Harvesting.
This sequence is similar in most respects to the investment decisionmaking model of institutional venture capital funds (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984;
Fried and Hisrich, 1994). However, the approach of business angels is less
sophisticated.
Agency theory provides a framework to study the investment process.
An agency relationship is said to exist when one individual (the principal)
engages the services of another individual (the agent) to perform a service
on their behalf (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). This involves the delegation of
a measure of decision-making authority from the principal to the agent. Both

knowledge of the industry/market and their overall impression
of the potential of the proposal. Also inﬂuenced by the source of

(ii) Detailed evaluation: the investor will examine the business
plan in detail, consult with associates, will meet the principals,
take up references, research the proposal. The decision will be
inﬂuenced by the potential of the industry, the business idea,
impressions of the principals and potential ﬁnancial rewards

Exit from the business, either because it fails or by selling
their shares to another investor. Investors normally exit from
successful investments by means of a trade sale

are assumed to be economic-maximizing individuals. The central concern of
agency theory is opportunism. The separation of ownership and control creates
the risk that the agent will make decisions that are not in the best interests of the
principal. This creates two types of risk for the principal (i.e., the investor). The
ﬁrst is adverse selection which arises as a result of informational asymmetries:
the agent is better informed than the principal about their true level of ability.
However, agents may deliberately misrepresent their abilities to the principal.
The second risk is moral hazard. In situations where it is not possible for the
principal to observe the behaviors of agents the agent may shirk, engage in
opportunistic behavior that is not in the interests of the principal or pursue
divergent interests that maximize their economic interests rather than those of
the principal. Fiet (1995) argued that every investment decision also includes
market risk—the risk that the business will perform less well than anticipated
on account of competitive conditions (e.g., competition, demand, technological
change). This section considers how business angels manage these sources of
risk.

<-----Page 16----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

5.1. Deal Origination
The evidence is consistent in suggesting that business angels adopt a
relatively ad hoc and unscientiﬁc approach to identifying investment opportunities. Atkin and Esiri (1993) emphasized that most investments arise from chance
encounters. Informal personal contacts—business associates and friends—are
the most signiﬁcant sources of deal ﬂow. Professional contacts are much less
signiﬁcant: of these, accountants are the most frequent sources whereas few
business angels receive deal ﬂow from lawyers, bankers and stockbrokers.
Those angels who are known in their communities also receive approaches from
entrepreneurs. Information in the media is another source of deal ﬂow for a
signiﬁcant minority of business angels. Some business angels also undertake
their own searches for investment opportunities. Those business angels who
are members of BANs also report that they are signiﬁcant sources of deal ﬂow
(Mason and Harrison, 1994, 2002a). In some cases—especially in the case of
ad hoc investors—the entrepreneur is not a stranger but a business associate
who is known to the angel (e.g., client, supplier) (Atkin and Esiri, 1993). Kelly
and Hay (2000) observed that the most active investors have less reliance than
occasional investors on “public” sources (e.g., accountants, lawyers, etc.) for
their deal ﬂow and. place more emphasis on “private” sources. Thus, most of
their deals are referred by individual and institutional sources in their extensive
and longstanding networks of relationships.
However, these various sources of information differ in their effectiveness. Freear et al. (1994b) calculated yield rates for various sources of deal ﬂow
(i.e., comparing investments made against deals referred for each information
source). This points to the informal personal sources of information—business
associates, friends and approaches from entrepreneurs—as the ones that have
the highest probability of leading to investments whereas non-personal sources
such as accountants, lawyers and banks have a low likelihood of generating
investments. These ﬁndings are largely corroborated by Mason and Harrison
(1994) for the U.K. However, in their study the highest yield rates are recorded
by some of the infrequently used professional contacts, notably banks and
stockbrokers. This study also notes the low yield ratio for BANs. Riding et al.
(1995) found that the rejection rate at the initial screening stage for deals
referred by business associates is lower than that for other referral sources.
Investing in businesses that are referred by trusted business associates
and friends is an obvious way in which business angels can minimize adverse
selection problems. As Riding et al. (1995) commented, “even if the principals
of the ﬁrm are unknown to the investors, if the investor knows and trusts the
referral source risk is reduced.” Deal referrers are passing judgment on the
merits of the opportunity and so are putting their own credibility and reputation
on the line.

<-----Page 17----->276

5.2. Deal Evaluation
The process of evaluating investment opportunities involves at least two
distinct stages—initial screening and detailed investigation (or due diligence—
Riding et al., 1993)—although this is not reﬂected in most studies. The initial
step of business angels is to assess investment opportunities for their “ﬁt”
with their own personal investment criteria. The investment opportunity will
also be considered in terms of its location (how close to home?), the nature
of the business and the amount needed and any other personal investment
criteria (Mason and Rogers, 1997). The business angel will also typically ask
themselves two further critical questions: ﬁrst, “Do I know anything about this
industry, market or technology?” and second, “Can I add any value to this
business?” Clearly, the ability to add value is very often a function of whether
the angel is familiar with the industry. If the answer to either question is negative
then the opportunity will be rejected at this point.
Angels then undertake a quick review of those opportunities that fall
within their investment criteria to derive some initial impressions. Although
most business angels expect a business plan, they are unlikely to read it in
detail at this stage. Their aim at this point in the decision-making process
is simply to assess whether the proposal has sufﬁcient merit to justify the
investment of time to undertake a detailed assessment. This stage has been the
subject of a detailed analysis by Mason and Rogers (1996, 1997) using verbal
protocol analysis, an experimental-type technique which asks subjects (in this
case business angels) to think out loud as they perform a task (in this case
evaluating a real investment opportunity). They observe that angels approach
this stage with a negative mindset, expecting that the opportunity will be poor
(because of the opportunities that they have previously seen) and looking for
reasons to reject it. This approach has been termed “three strikes and you’re
out” (Mason and Rogers, 1996, 1997) and is supported by evidence that the
rejection of opportunities is generally based on several factors rather than a
single deal killer (Mason and Harrison, 1996c). The market and the entrepreneur
are the key considerations at this stage. Less signiﬁcant are the product/service
and ﬁnancial factors. Indeed, angels exhibit considerable skepticism about the
value of ﬁnancial information in the business plan of start-ups: as one investor
in the Mason and Rogers (1996, p. 45) study commented, “I take [ﬁnancial
projections] with a great pinch of salt, especially from accountants because
they can tweak the assumptions and come up with any ﬁgure. So, it’s the last
thing I look at.” Nevertheless, investors want to see that there is the potential
for signiﬁcant ﬁnancial return, that the principals are ﬁnancially committed and
what the money that is invested will be used for. Some angels will be ﬂexible,
willing to treat these criteria as compensatory (e.g., a strong management team
would compensate for a distant location), whereas others will regard them as
noncompensatory (Feeney et al., 1999).

<-----Page 18----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

277

The purpose of the initial screen is to ﬁlter out “no hopers” in order to
focus their time on those opportunities that appear to have potential. These are
subject to more detailed appraisal. The investor will read the business plan in
detail, go over the ﬁnancial information, visit the premises, do some personal
research to gather additional information on market potential, competition
and so on, and assess the principals. Indeed, getting to know the principals
personally (by a series of formal and informal meetings) is the most vital part of
the process (May and Simmons, 2001). This stage has received little attention
from researchers. According to May and Simmons (2001, p. 101), “it might
consist of a few phone calls and a visit or two, or weeks of meetings, documents
ﬂying back and forth and questions, questions, questions.” However, it would
appear that most angels emphasize their intuition and gut feeling rather than
performing formal analysis (Haines et al., 2003)—although more experienced
angels, and angel groups (see Section 6) adopt more sophisticated approaches
(e.g., see Blair, 1996). 11
Once the opportunity has passed from the initial screen the importance
of “people” factors becomes critical (Riding et al., 1995), with investors
emphasizing management abilities, an understanding of what is required to
be successful, a strong work ethic, integrity, honesty, openness and personal
chemistry (Haines et al., 2003; Mason and Stark, 2004). This reﬂects the long
and personal nature of the angel-entrepreneur relationship. 12 Rewards, realism
of the projections and potential also assume greater importance while “investor
ﬁt” becomes less of a consideration (Riding et al., 1995).
This stage ends when the investor has decided whether or not to
negotiate a deal with the investor. In their Canadian study Riding et al. (1993)
found that 72.6% of opportunities were rejected at the initial impressions stage,
a further 15.9% were rejected following more detailed evaluation, and as this
stage proceeds another 6.3% were eliminated, a cumulative rejection rate of
94.8%. Thus, business angels proceed to the negotiation stage with only 5% of
the investment opportunities that they receive.
The key role of the entrepreneur/management team in the decision
whether or not to invest is conﬁrmed in other studies. Using conjoint analysis—
a method to measure quantitatively the relative importance of one decisionmaking criteria in relation to another (see Shepherd and Zacharakis, 1999)—
Landström (1998) found that business angels attach the greatest importance
to the leadership capabilities of the principals, followed by the potential of
the ﬁrm’s market and products. Feeney et al.’s (1999) approach was to ask
business angels “what are the most common shortcomings of business opportunities that you have reviewed recently?” This highlighted shortcomings
in both the management (lack of management knowledge, lack of realistic
expectations, personal qualities) and the business (poor management team, poor
proﬁt potential for the level of risk, poor ﬁt, undercapitalized/lack of liquidity,

<-----Page 19----->278

C.M. Mason

insufﬁcient information provided). Asking investors “what are the essential
factors that prompted you to invest in the ﬁrms that you have chosen?” (Feeney
et al., 1999) highlighted three management attributes—track record, realism
and integrity and openness—and four attributes of the business—potential for
high proﬁt, an exit plan, security on their investment and involvement of the
investor. However, while the primarily deal killer is the perception of poor
management, the decision to invest in an opportunity involves a consideration
of management ability, growth and proﬁt potential. In other words, angels are
looking for businesses that show growth potential and have an entrepreneurial
team with the capability to realize that potential (Feeney et al., 1999). Both
these studies also emphasize that investment criteria are personal, with angels
using different criteria in their assessment of investment proposals. For example,
Feeney et al. (1999) suggested that the decision processes of more experienced
investors differs from that of less experienced investors.
This emphasis on the entrepreneur reﬂects the view of angels that
agency risk is more of a threat than market risk. Fiet (1995) argued that
business angels lack information or the tools and resources to evaluate market
risks effectively. As a consequence, they specialize in evaluating agency risk—
assessing whether or not the entrepreneur can be relied upon as a venture
manager—while relying upon competent and trustworthy entrepreneurs to
manage market risk. 13 This contrasts with venture capital funds which attach
more importance to market risk than agency risk. They are less concerned with
agency risk because they have learned how to protect themselves using stringent
boilerplate contractual provisions which allows them to replace an entrepreneur
who is not performing or is found to be incompetent. Thus, “compared with
venture capital investors, business angels place much more importance upon
screening entrepreneurs than deals for market risk” (Fiet, 1995, p. 567).
5.3. Negotiation and Contracting
Having decided, in principle, to invest the business angel must negotiate
terms and conditions of the investment that are acceptable both to themselves
and also to the entrepreneur. There are three main issues—valuation, structuring
of the deal (share price, type of shares, size of shareholding, timing) and
the terms and conditions of the investment, including the investor’s role. In
agency theory terms deal structuring—mechanisms for allocating the rewards
to the investor and entrepreneur—are an attempt to align the behaviors of the
entrepreneur with that of the investor, while the terms and conditions attempt
to control the behaviors of the entrepreneur. These are major lacunae in the
informal venture capital market research.
In the study by Riding et al. (1993), half of the investment opportunities
that reached this stage were not consummated. The most frequent reason for not

<-----Page 20----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

279

making an investment was associated with valuation, notably “inappropriate
views by entrepreneurs (in the opinion of the investors) regarding the value
of the ﬁrm as a whole and, within the ﬁrm, the value of an idea compared to
the overall value of a business. Most investors note that potential entrepreneurs
overvalue the idea and undervalue the potential contributions (both ﬁnancial and
non-ﬁnancial) that are required to grow and develop a business” (Haines et al.,
2003, p. 24). Putting a value on the “sweat equity” of the entrepreneurs is also
problematic.
There is no universally agreed method of valuing a small company.
Market-based valuations are inappropriate because small businesses are not
continually valued by the market and appropriate comparator stocks are unlikely
to be available. Asset-based valuations are more commonly used although
ﬁnance theory prefers earnings or cash-ﬂow based valuations because they value
the business in terms of the future stream of earnings that shareholders might
expect from the business. However, these approaches are complex. Valuation
of new and early stage businesses adds further complications because they
may only have intangible assets (e.g. intellectual property). It is therefore not
surprising, especially since most angel investments are concentrated at start-up
and early stage, that methods of pricing and calculating the size of shareholdings
are remarkably imprecise and subjective (Mason and Harrison, 1996d), based
on rough rules of thumb or gut feeling. As investors, May and Simmons (2001,
p. 129) noted that “the truth about valuing a start-up is that it’s often a guess.”
Where an attempt is made to price the investment on a more rigorous basis
then the earnings based approach is the most common method (Lengyel and
Gulliford, 1997).
Angels draw up contracts as a matter of course to safeguard their investment, although their degree of sophistication varies. Contracts specify the rights
and obligations of both parties and what will by done, by whom and over what
time frame. Their objective is to align the incentives of the entrepreneur and
the investor by means of performance incentives and direct control measures.
Kelly and Hay (2003) noted that certain issues are nonnegotiable: veto rights
over acquisitions/divestments, prior approval for strategic plans and budgets,
restrictions on the ability of management to issue share options, noncompete
contracts required by entrepreneurs on the termination of their employment in
the business and restrictions on the ability to raise additional debt or equity
ﬁnance. These issues give investors a say in material decisions that could impact
the nature of the business or the level of equity holding. However, there are
also a number of contractual provisions to which angels attach low importance,
and which might be considered to be negotiable. These include forced exit
provisions, investor approval for senior personnel hiring/ﬁring decisions, the
need for investors to countersign bank checks, management equity ratchet provisions and the speciﬁcation of a dispute resolution mechanism. Less experienced

<-----Page 21----->280

C.M. Mason

investors place relatively greater emphasis on the need to include a broad
array of contractual safeguards to protect their interests. However, experienced
investors are more likely to include speciﬁc provisions that can impact the level
of their equity stake (share options, ratchets) and the timing of exit (forced
exit provisions). In other words, with experience business angels become more
focused on those elements that can impact their ﬁnancial return.
Investors recognize that the investment agreement must be fair to both
sides (May and Simmons, 2001): contracts that favor the investor will be
detrimental to the entrepreneur’s motivation. In Mason and Harrison’s (1996d)
study, two-thirds of investors and entrepreneurs considered that the investment
agreement was equally favorable to both sides, and half of the investors reported
that this was their objective. Indeed, a signiﬁcant minority of investors believed
that the agreement actually favored the entrepreneur. Thus, the available evidence suggests that in most cases entrepreneurs are not exploited by investors
when raising ﬁnance.
The inclusion of contractual safeguards does not indicate whether
investors will be willing to invoke them to protect their interests. Moreover,
contracts are, of necessity, incomplete by their very nature. There are three
reasons for this: it is costly to write complete contracts; it is impossible to
foresee all contingencies; and on account of asymmetric information (van
Osnabrugge, 2000). Thus, in practice investors place a heavy reliance on their
relationship with the entrepreneur to deal with any problems that arise (van
Osnabrugge, 2000; Kelly and Hay, 2003). Indeed, Landström et al. (1998)
argued that one of the purposes of establishing a contractual framework at the
outset is to provide a basis for the development of a relationship between the
parties to develop. In other words, the contract is less a protection mechanism
per se; rather, it is a means by which mutual behaviors expectations of all parties
in the transaction can be clariﬁed.
Most angel investments involve input from professional advisers. For
example, lawyers would normally review, and might draw up, the investment
agreement, but would not be involved in the negotiations. Similarly, accountants
may be consulted for advice but would rarely play a more prominent role.
Thus, transactions costs are low (Mason and Harrison, 1996d). In Lengyel and
Gulliford’s (1997) study the entrepreneur’s costs amounted to an average of
5.1% of the funds raised (and 29% reported no costs) while for the investor the
average costs were 2.8% of the amount invested (and 57% reported no costs).
The time taken by business angels to make investments is much
quicker than that of venture capital funds (Freear et al., 1995). Mason and
Harrison (1996d) reported that in their study the entire investment process rarely
extended over more than three months, and often took less than a month. Most
negotiations took less than a week to complete whereas the evaluation could
take up to three months or more. Thus, in nearly half of the investments less

<-----Page 22----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

281

than a month elapsed between the entrepreneur’s ﬁrst meeting with the investor
and the decision to invest; in 85% of cases the elapsed time was under three
months.
5.4. Post-Investment Involvement
From an agency perspective, monitoring is the main way in which
principals attempt to mitigate the risk of opportunistic behaviors on the part
of the agent going undetected. In line with this expectation, most business
angels play an active role in their investee businesses. There is a spectrum of
involvement: at one extreme are passive investors who are content to receive
occasional information to monitor the performance of their investment while
at the other extreme are investors who use their investment to buy themselves
a job. However, most angels do not want day-to-day involvement hence the
typical involvement ranges from a day a week (or its equivalent) to less than
a day a month (Mason and Harrison, 1996d). Nevertheless, Sætre (2003)
emphasized that some angels are so involved, and involved so early, that they are
indistinguishable from the entrepreneurs, and are seen by the entrepreneurs as
being part of the entrepreneurial team. In a similar vein, Politis and Landström
(2002) see angel investing as simply a continuation of an entrepreneurial career.
Madill et al. (2005) identiﬁed a number of roles that business angels
play in their investee businesses: advice about the management of the business,
contacts, hands-on assistance (e.g., legal advice, accountancy advice, provision
of resources), providing business and marketing intelligence, serving on the
Board of Directors or Advisory Board, preparing ﬁrms to raise venture capital
and providing credibility and validation. Sørheim (2005) emphasized the role of
business angels in helping their investee businesses to raise additional ﬁnance.
The nature and level of involvement is inﬂuenced by geography. Landström
(1992) noted that frequency of contact between angels and their investee
companies is inversely related to the geographical distance that separates them.
It will also be inﬂuenced by the performance of the business, with angels more
involved at particular stages of business development and in crisis situations.
However, in contrast to agency theory the involvement of angels in
their investee businesses is not motivated by monitoring considerations. First,
as noted earlier, angels derive psychic income from their involvement in their
investee businesses in the form of fun and satisfaction from working with new
and growing businesses and their belief that their experience, know how and
insights can “make a difference.” May and Simmons (2001, p. 156) quoted
one investor as follows: “I’ve never had as much fun in my life. It’s a joy to
see someone listen, take action and win.” Second, angels see themselves as
“offering help” rather than “checking up” on their investee businesses by acting
as mentors, providing contacts, guidance and hands-on assistance (Haines et al.,

<-----Page 23----->282

C.M. Mason

2003). Third, as Kelly and Hay (2003, p. 309) commented, “from the outset, the
relationship between the business angel and the entrepreneur appears to be more
positive and trusting in character than the inherently adversarial one implied by
agency theorists.”
A majority of entrepreneurs and angels regard their relationship as
productive and consensual—although entrepreneurs have a more favorable view
of its productiveness than angels (Freear et al., 1995; Mason and Harrison,
1996d). One study reported that half of the entrepreneurs who had raised
ﬁnance from business angels regarded their contributions as being helpful
or very helpful (Mason and Harrison, 1996d). Another study reported that
entrepreneurs considered that the most valuable contribution of their business
angel has been as a sounding board (Harrison and Mason, 1992). There is a
suggestion that entrepreneurs want their investors to be more involved in certain
areas, especially ﬁnancial management (Ehrlich et al., 1994). Criticisms by
entrepreneurs who have raised ﬁnance from angels are mainly concerned with
those who lack knowledge of the product or market (Lengyel and Gulliford,
1997). Finally, most business angels report that they have derived fun and
enjoyment from their investments, often more than expected, in cases where the
investment is still trading, but not when the business has failed. Psychic income
returns are therefore related to business performance rather than compensating
for ﬁnancial loss (Mason and Harrison, 1996d). However, there has been no
rigorous attempt to assess whether this involvement of business angels has
a favorable impact on the performance of their investee businesses. There is
no evidence from research on venture capital funds that greater involvement
is a necessary condition for adding value nor whether involvement produces
enhanced business performance (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994; Fried et al., 1998).
This may be because the involvement of venture capitalists is concentrated
on their poorly performing investments, determining whether and how they
can be turned around, or even whether continued support is desirable (Zider,
1998; Higashide and Birley, 2002). 14 There are also formidable methodological
challenges. 15
5.5. Harvesting
Investing in unquoted companies is regarded as high risk. Certainly,
the performance of European venture capital funds specializing in early stage
investments (in practice this means technology-focused investments) have much
lower rates of return than those which focus on later stage investments (EVCA,
2005). Diversiﬁcation is the main strategy for reducing risk. However, this is
not an option for business angels. First, typically they have just a handful of
investments in their portfolios. Second, they often restrict their investments to
sectors which they know and understand, so their portfolios are unbalanced.

<-----Page 24----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

283

Third, as the ﬁrst external investor in a business, and generally lacking the
ﬁnancial resources to make follow-on investments, they are vulnerable to being
diluted in the event that further funding rounds are required.
There have been only two studies of the investment returns of business
angels, a small scale Finnish study (Lumme et al., 1998) and a larger U.K. study
(Mason and Harrison, 2002b). It is important to note that these studies only
measure multiples achieved on the amounts invested. However, many angels
also attempt to draw back at least part of their investment in the form of a
director’s fee or interest on loans provided, either immediately or at some stage
in the future when the business is ﬁnancially stronger. This could be quite a
signiﬁcant proportion of the investment in smaller deals (Mason and Harrison,
1996d; Lengyel and Gulliford, 1997). The U.K. study highlights the highly
skewed distribution of returns, with 40% of investments making a loss (34%
a total loss), and another 13% only achieving break-even or generating bank
account-level returns. However, there was a signiﬁcant subset of investments,
some 23% in total, which generated internal rates of return (IRRs) in excess of
50%.
The U.K. study went on to explore the types of investments that were
likely to be successful. It identiﬁed large investments, large deal sizes and
deals involving multiple investors as being more likely to be high performing
investments (Mason and Harrison, 2002b). A separate analysis of the returns
distribution of technology and nontechnology investments found no signiﬁcant
differences in the returns proﬁle (Mason and Harrison, 2004b). This may
suggest that the risk of investing in technology sectors has been over-stated.
Another possibility is that business angels are better able to mitigate the risks
involved in investing in technology businesses on account of their specialist
expertise and entrepreneurial background.
The Finnish study, in contrast, sought to identify differences between
the most, and least, successful investors. The most successful investors were
more likely to be motivated by the fun and interest of making such investments,
have a large deal ﬂow and have a lower estimation of the value of their hands-on
involvement. The least successful investors were more likely to be motivated
by altruism, have a low deal ﬂow and make few investments and rely to a
greater extent on friends for deal ﬂow. They were also more likely to make
investments in friends’ businesses and have a different pattern of hands-on
involvement, over-emphasizing contributions that other research has suggested
are least important in adding value (Lumme et al., 1998).
Comparison with the returns achieved by institutional venture capital
investors is problematic because the reporting unit is the fund, whereas angels
invest on a deal-by-deal basis. However, Murray (1999) reported deal-speciﬁc
returns for one U.K. venture capital fund. Comparing the returns achieved by
business angels with this information reveals a much higher loss rate by the

<-----Page 25----->284

C.M. Mason

venture capital fund (64%) and a lower proportion of investments that generated
a moderate return, but a very similar proportion of high return investments (IRR
in excess of 50%). The interpretation of these differences is that because the
venture capital fund is seeking to maximize the performance of the fund it can
be more ruthless with those investments that are performing moderately, in order
to focus the time of its executives on supporting the best performing investments
whereas business angels invest on a deal-by-deal basis (Mason and Harrison,
2002b).
Business angels are thought to be relatively patient investors, willing
to hold their investments for up to seven years or more (Wetzel, 1981; Mason
and Harrison, 1994). In reality, angels hold their investments for a much shorter
time. The median time to exit in the U.K. is four years for high performing
investments and six years for moderately performing investments, while failures
appear, on average, after two years (Mason and Harrison, 2002b). In Finland
investments that had a positive outcome were ﬁve years old at harvest whereas
those that failed had an average holding time of 2.8 years. In both studies a
trade sale (i.e., sale of the company to another company) was the most common
exit route for successful investments, with an IPO only accounting for a small
minority of cases. Trade sales, along with sale to existing shareholders were the
most common exit routes for investments with little or no value.

6. THE EVOLUTION OF THE ANGEL MARKET
Recent research in the U.S. has revealed that the angel market place is
evolving from a largely invisible, atomistic market dominated by individual and
small ad hoc groups of investors who strive to keep a low proﬁle and rely on
word-of-mouth for their investment opportunities, to a more organized market
place in which angel syndicates (sometimes termed ‘structured angel groups’)
are becoming increasingly signiﬁcant. As a result, the angel market place is in
the process of being transformed from a “hobby” activity to one that is now
increasingly professional in its operation, with published routines for accessing
deals, screening deals, undertaking due diligence, negotiating and investing
(May, 2002). Sohl et al. (2000) claimed that “angel alliances are the fastest
growing segment of the early stage equity market.” However, solo investors
still dominate the market (Lengyel and Gulliford, 1997; Investor Pulse, 2003;
Infometrics, 2004).
The Band of Angels, which was founded in Silicon Valley in 1995, is
generally regarded as the ﬁrst organized syndicate to be formed. Others, such as
Tech Coast Angels (1997), Sierra Angels (1997), Common Angels (1997) and
The Dinner Club (1999), soon followed. 16 There are currently estimated to be
around 200 angel syndicates located throughout the U.S. and growing evidence

<-----Page 26----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

285

of specialization by industry sector (e.g., health care angel syndicates) and type
of investor (e.g., women-only angel syndicates). A national body to bring angel
groups together for the purposes of transferring best practice, lobbying and data
collection was created in 2003 (Angel Capital Association, 2005). The same
trend is also clearly evident in the U.K. although at an earlier stage, and it has
not attracted the same degree of attention from researchers or commentators. 17
Angel syndicates emerged because individual angels found advantages
of working together, notably in terms of better deal ﬂow, superior evaluation
and due diligence of investment opportunities, and the ability to make more and
bigger investments, as well as social attractions. They operate by aggregating
the investment capacity of individual high net worth individuals (HNWIs).
Some groups are member-managed while others are manager-led (Preston,
2004). Syndicates take various forms but the most common generic type of
model (at least in the U.S.) is as follows:
• Limited and selective membership of angels (typically 20–75 members)
who typically play an active role in the investment process.
• Meet regularly (e.g., for dinner) to hear ‘pitches’ by entrepreneurs
seeking ﬁnance.
• A syndicate manager supports members by organizing meetings, communications and manages logistics.
• The manager or a core group of members will screen the deal ﬂow and
select the companies which are invited to pitch.
• Q&A session follows each pitch.
• Angels vote whether to pursue their interest in the business.
• If the vote is in favor a sub-group will be appointed to undertake the due
diligence and report back to the full membership.
• If the recommendation is positive, individual members make their own
decisions whether or not to invest (there is likely to be a minimum
investment threshold for each deal) and the syndicate will combine all
of the member dollars into a single investment. Alternatively, if the
syndicate operates a pooled fund a majority vote will decide whether or
not to invest.
• An expectation that each member of the syndicate will make a certain
number of investments per year.
Some of the larger and longer established U.S. syndicates have also
established sidecar funds—that is, committed sources of capital that invest
alongside the angel group. The investors in such funds are normally the
syndicate members but may also include other HNWIs or institutions. These
funds give the syndicate additional capital to invest in deals to avoid dilution,
enables syndicate members to achieve greater diversiﬁcation by exposing them

<-----Page 27----->286

C.M. Mason

to more investments than they can make directly through the syndicate, and is
a means of attracting “right-minded” investors who want to participate in seed
and early stage deals but cannot be active members of a syndicate (e.g., because
of lack of time).
The emergence of angel syndicates is of enormous signiﬁcance for
the development and maintenance of an entrepreneurial economy. First, they
reduce sources of inefﬁciency in the angel market. The angel market has
traditionally been characterized by inefﬁciency on account of the fragmented
and invisible nature of angels. There was no mechanism for angels to receive a
steady ﬂow of investment opportunities. They found their deals by chance. The
entrepreneur’s search for angel ﬁnance was equally a hit-or-miss affair. Investors
and entrepreneurs both incurred high search costs (Wetzel, 1987; Mason and
Harrison, 1994). This encouraged many to drop out of the market as either
suppliers or seekers of ﬁnance. Angel syndicates, in contrast, are generally
visible and are therefore easier for entrepreneurs to approach.
A further source of inefﬁciency was that each investment made by an
investor has typically been a one-off that was screened, evaluated and negotiated
separately. However, because of the volume of investments that angel syndicates
make they have been able to develop efﬁcient routines for handling investment
inquiries, screening opportunities and making investment agreements.
Second, they have stimulated the supply-side of the market. Syndicates
offer considerable attractions for HNWIs who want to invest in emerging companies, particularly those who lack the time, referral sources, investment skills
or the ability to add value. However, many individuals who have the networks
and skills to be able to invest on their own are also attracted by the reduction in
risk that arises from investing as part of a syndicate, notably the ability to spread
their investments more widely and thereby achieve greater diversiﬁcation, and
access to group skills and knowledge to evaluate investment opportunities and
provide more effective post-investment support. Other attractions of syndicates
are that they enable individual angels to invest in particular opportunities that
they could never have invested in as individuals, offer the opportunity to learn
from more experienced investors and provide opportunities for camaraderie and
schmoozing with like-minded individuals. Syndicates will also be attractive to
individuals who want to be full-time angels. Thus, angel syndicates are able to
attract and mobilize funds that might otherwise have been invested elsewhere
(e.g., property, stock market, collecting), thereby increasing the supply of early
stage venture capital, and to invest it more efﬁciently and effectively.
Third, they are helping to ﬁll the “new” equity gap. Venture capital
funds have consistently raised their minimum size of investment and are increasingly abandoning the early stage market (after brieﬂy returning during the
“dot-com bubble” of the late 1990s). Most funds have a minimum investment
size of at least £500,000 and the average early stage investment by U.K. venture

<-----Page 28----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

287

capital funds in recent years has been around £1m (BVCA, 2004). This has
resulted in the emergence of a new equity gap—roughly the £250,000 to £2m+
range which covers amounts that are too large for typical “3F” money (founder,
family, friends) but too small for most venture capital funds. Angel syndicates
are now increasingly the only source of venture capital in this size range. The
same trends—increasing deal sizes by venture capital funds and emergence of
angel syndicates to ﬁll the gap—are also evident in the U.S. where the “gap” is
estimated to be in the $500,000 to $5m range (Sohl, 1999, 2003).
Fourth, they have the ability to provide follow-on funding. One of the
potential problems of raising money from individual business angels is that they
often lack the ﬁnancial capacity to provide follow-on funding. The consequence
has been that the entrepreneur is often forced to embark on a further search for
ﬁnance. Moreover, in the event that the need for additional ﬁnance is urgent then
both the entrepreneur and the angel will ﬁnd themselves in a weak negotiating
position with potential new investors, resulting in a dilution in their investments
and the imposition of harsh terms and conditions. With the withdrawal of many
venture capital funds from the small end of the market individual angels and
their investee businesses have increasingly been faced with the problem of
the absence of follow-on investors. However, because angel syndicates have
got greater ﬁnancial ﬁrepower than individual angels or ad hoc angel groups
they are able to provide follow-on ﬁnancing, making it more efﬁcient for the
entrepreneur who avoids the need to start the search for ﬁnance anew each time
a new round of funding is required.
Fifth, their ability to add value to their investments is much greater.
The range of business expertise that is found among angel syndicate members
means that in most circumstances they are able to contribute much greater valueadded to investee businesses than an individual business angel, or even most
early stage venture capital funds. May and Simmons (2001, p. 156), leading
angel syndicate practitioners in the U.S., commented that “when angels band
together . . . their smorgasbord of advice and strategic services frequently makes
the difference between life and death for a start-up.”
Finally, angel syndicates have greater credibility with venture capitalists. Venture capital funds often have a negative view of business angels, seeing
them as amateurs whose involvement in the ﬁrst funding round of an investment
could complicate subsequent funding rounds because of their tendency to overprice investments, use complicated types of investment instruments and make
over-elaborate investment agreements (Harrison and Mason, 2000). Venture
capitalists may therefore avoid deals in which angels are involved because they
perceive them to be too complicated to do. However, because of the professionalism and quality of the membership of angel syndicates venture capital funds
hold them in much higher esteem. Accordingly, the increasing prominence of
angel syndicates results in much greater complementarity between the angel

<-----Page 29----->288

C.M. Mason

market and venture capital funds, to the beneﬁt of fast-growing companies that
raised their initial funding from angel syndicates but now need access to the
amounts of ﬁnance that venture capital funds can provide.

7. CONCLUSION
This chapter has sought to highlight the signiﬁcance of the informal
venture capital market as a source of funding for entrepreneurial businesses.
However, its signiﬁcance is frequently overlooked in both the academic and
practitioner literature and by policy-makers where the emphasis continues to
be placed on institutional venture capital, despite its almost non-existent role
in funding new and recently started businesses. There are three inter-related
reasons why the informal venture capital market is often overlooked. First,
the market is invisible and fragmented. There are no directories of angel
investors and their investments are not recorded in any systematic way. Second,
because of the invisibility of business angels, and their efforts to maintain
their secrecy, it is extremely difﬁcult to undertake research on the size and
operation of the market. Research is typically based on small-scale snapshot
samples of convenience which are unsuited to statistical analysis. Third, the
research base is limited and largely atheoretical. Indeed, the initial studies in the
1980s and early 1990s were descriptive, aimed at proﬁling angel characteristics,
motivations and investment activity. However, recent research has become more
analytical, focusing on actual behaviors rather than preferences, on aspects of
the investment process rather than on the actors, and has become more anchored
in theory, with several studies using agency theory as a framework for analysis.
Nevertheless, the opportunities for further research are considerable.
First, there is an urgent need to get way from snapshot surveys of the
angel market and to develop longitudinal research on the angel market. This
involves two dimensions (Sohl, 2003). The ﬁrst has the business angel as the
unit of analysis and seeks to develop information on investor and investment
trends. The challenge, as always, is in the methodology. One approach is simply
to repeat snapshot surveys at regular intervals. A more manageable, if partial,
approach is to identify and survey angel syndicates on a regular basis, while
a third approach would be to develop an angel panel which is surveyed on a
regular basis. The second approach takes the deal as the unit of analysis and
tracks it from the point of referral to the angel through to rejection or investment
and on to subsequent funding round and exit. Much of the research in venture
capital is ‘timeless’ in the sense that it does not reﬂect the economic conditions
of the time (Mason and Harrison, 2004c). Thus, an important dimension of such
longitudinal studies involves relating investment trends to the wider economic
conditions of the time. For example, how angels responded to the post-2000

<-----Page 30----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

289

investment downturn remains largely unexplored and unanswered (but see
Mason, 2006, for a brief discussion).
Second, the emergence of angel syndicates raises a series of questions.
Are they attracting investors who are new to the market, and thus new money
that would otherwise have been invested elsewhere, or are they attracting solo
angels? If they are attracting solo angels, will this deplete the population of
small-scale investors and thereby re-open the sub £250,000/$500,000 equity
gap? As angel syndicates become more organized and develop ﬁxed costs will
this lead to an upward drift in their investment activity, thereby re-opening the
equity gap?
Third, taking a “food chain” perspective, are the complementarities
between angels and venture capital funds diminishing as venture capital funds
continue to shift their investment focus to larger and later stage deals. Can
angel syndicates ﬁll this gap—are their ﬁnancial resources big enough to
by-pass venture capital funds and take their investee businesses to a harvest
event themselves, or by co-investing with other angel syndicates? Indeed,
are we seeing the beginning of a bifurcation of the venture capital market
between businesses that because of the scale of their R&D or capital investment
require multi-million dollar investments over several rounds (e.g., life sciences,
telecoms infrastructure), and therefore need funding from venture capital funds,
and businesses (e.g., software) whose funding requirements are more modest,
in the $10m–$20m range, and so could be funded largely or entirely by angel
syndicates?
Fourth, the chapter has noted that many governments now recognize
the economic signiﬁcance of business angels and have introduced various
measures to support the informal venture capital market. However, Aernoudt
(1999) argued that the case for government intervention is not proven. Thus,
there is scope for further applied research which explores whether the case for
intervention is justiﬁed, and if the case is supported what is the most appropriate
form(s) of intervention. Can the studies that various national venture capital
associations undertake of the economic impact of venture capital be replicated
for informal venture capital? Research from various countries is consistent
in ﬁnding that angels are opportunity constrained. Understanding the reasons
would seem to be the top priority for policy-makers. How much stems from
the limitations of the investors themselves (e.g., restricted investment criteria,
competence limitations), how much is due to the inefﬁciencies in the operation
of the market and how much is a result of the lack of investment readiness
among businesses seeking ﬁnance? Can “second generation” business angel
networks—which focus on raising the competence of the participants in the
market—make a difference?
There are also a host of issues where information is either lacking
or requires corroboration. Examples of the former include identifying the

<-----Page 31----->290

C.M. Mason

characteristics of altruistic investors (Sullivan, 1994), women business angels
(Brush et al., 2002; Harrison and Mason, 2005) and successful investors. The
concept of an “angel career” (Politis and Landström, 2002) offers a potentially
useful way in which to explore angel learning. The negotiation, valuation
and contracting stages remain poorly understood. For example, exploring the
entrepreneur’s perspective would be a useful way in which to extend Kelly and
Hay’s (2003) pioneering study of business angel contracts. Many aspects of
the post-investment relationship also require to be examined. Understanding
the relational component is one issue. How do the parties cope with adversity?
When do business angels ﬁnd it necessary to assert their rights and how do
they do so? (Kelly and Hay, 2003). Quantifying the impact of the valueadded contribution of angels on business performance, and the contributions of
different types of business angels, is another issue that requires attention. Mason
and Harrison’s (2002a) study of investment returns requires corroboration.
Meanwhile, adopting new methodological approaches to explore topics that
are better understood (e.g., investment decision-making) might provide new
insights or challenge existing understanding. Finally, future research needs to
have stronger theoretical foundations. Agency theory—the most commonly
used theoretical framework - has been shown to have its limitations in a business
angel context (Landström, 1992; Kelly and Hay 2003), thus, there is a need for
alternative theoretical perspectives.

NOTES
1 The term angel was coined by Broadway insiders in the early 1900s to describe wealthy
theater-goers who made high-risk investments in theatrical productions. Angels invested in these
shows primarily for the privilege of rubbing shoulders with the theater personalities that they
admired. The term business angel was given to those individuals who perform essentially the
same function in a business context (Benjamin and Margulis, 2000, p. 5). There is a long tradition
of angel investing in businesses (Sohl, 2003). However, this type of business ﬁnancing has only
become signiﬁcant since the 1950s and 1960s when a lot of the pioneering garage start-ups in
Silicon Valley obtained their initial funding from this source.
2 Anyone who had personally invested in a business start-up which was not their own, excluding
stock and mutual funds.
3 See Hindle and Rushworth (2001) for an international comparison of angel proﬁles.
4 Nevertheless, business angels remain largely a phenomenon of Anglo-Saxon countries. For

example, in Europe business angels are much more prominent in North West Europe than
in Southern Europe. One possible explanation is that in such countries other actors—such
as Impannatori in the industrial districts of Italy—perform the functions of business angels
(Lazzeretti et al., 2004).
5 This paradox is explained, at least in part, by the contrasts in data availability. There are
databases on formal venture capital investments whereas informal venture capital investments
go unrecorded. In addition, venture capital fund managers are listed in directories whereas

<-----Page 32----->Informal Sources of Venture Finance

291

business angels are invisible. The consequence is that researchers must adopt creative techniques
for identifying business angels and getting them to respond to surveys. In practice, much of
the research is based—of necessity—on samples of convenience which cannot be tested for
representativeness because the population of angels is unknown (Wetzel, 1981). Difﬁculties in
identifying business angels and low response rates because of their desire for privacy results in
small sample sizes which restricts the scope for rigorous statistical analysis (Mason and Harrison,
1994, pp. 71–76; Hindle and Rushworth, 2001, pp. 10–11).
6 Visser and Williams (2001) emphasized that T&T artists are distinguished from “company

doctors” who may be called in to turn a business around but do not necessarily invest their own
money, and from “corporate raiders” who may, or may not, invest their own money but whose
aim is to sell off valuable components of the business as soon as possible.
7 For a venture capital fund the transactions costs involved in making investments—the time

involved in undertaking the evaluation and negotiation of a deal, professional costs and the
provision of post-investment support—are both substantial and largely ﬁxed regardless the size of
the investment. In “small” investments, these transaction costs represent a signiﬁcant proportion
of the overall investment, making them uneconomic. Business angels are able to make small
investments because they do not cost their time in the same way as a venture capital fund managers
and their requirement for professional support, for example, from lawyers and accountants, is
minimal.
8 As Gaston (1989b) noted, the ﬁnancial needs of new and young businesses are not neatly
boxed into separate loan and equity categories. Their capital needs frequently shift between these
types. Angels make their investments in the form of loans (usually unsecured), loan guarantees,
equity and combinations of these types of ﬁnance.
9 Many business angels suffered serious losses in the technology downturn. Those most affected

were investors in technology businesses. Many of these businesses failed as a result of market
decline or faulty business models. However, business angels also lost out in situations where
businesses were able to raise further funding from either their existing venture capital investors
or from new investors. In these circumstances, a combination of the inability of angels to provide
follow-on funding, the much lower valuation of the subsequent funding compared with the
original investment by the angels (“down-rounds”) and their loss of rights as a result of the very
onerous terms and conditions under which the venture capital funds invested in down rounds
(e.g., liquidation preferences) resulted in a signiﬁcant dilution in the angel’s investment, often
to the extent of rendering it worthless even if the investee company was a going concern. The
consequence of this aggressive behavior by venture capital funds has been to create considerable
bad feeling between them and the angel community (Mason, 2006).
10 However, there is a greater chance of a mismatch between the needs of the entrepreneurs

and the preferences and value-added skills of potential investors in such regions. Johnstone
(2001) noted that in the case of Cape Breton demand for angel ﬁnance is concentrated among
IT businesses and they want investors to provide marketing and management inputs whereas the
investors typically have no knowledge of the sector and so have limited ability to add value.
11 Benjamin and Margulis (2000, pp. 205–218) provided an example of a due diligence question-

naire.
12 Riding et al. (1995) quoted one Canadian investor who said that the potential investee business
had to pass what was termed “the Toledo test.” That is, if the angel was not willing to spend a
weekend in Toledo (a particularly unattractive U.S. city with few diversions) with the principal(s),
the investment would not be undertaken. The British equivalent might be “the Luton test” or “the
Hull test” (these cities have the dubious privilege of coming out top of the ﬁrst and second Crap
Town League: www.craptowns.com).

<-----Page 33----->292

C.M. Mason

13 Sørheim (2003, p. 357) makes a similar point. “. . . Experienced business angels in the study

emphasize that they are investing in the very early stage in the life cycle of entrepreneurial
ventures. Consequently, they must by-and-large depend on the information provided by the
entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team, and are therefore very much concerned with [their]
perceived trustworthiness. . . . The investors in this study perceive the creation of some kind of
common platform involving shared goals and values as an antecedent for developing trustworthy
relationships between entrepreneurs and [themselves]. If this common platform is found to be
lacking they reject the opportunity.”
14 In contrast, Sapienza et al. (1996) argued that venture capitalists adopt a “home run” strategy

of focusing their attention on likely winners rather than those businesses in their portfolio which
are likely to yield little return.
15 Harrison and Mason (2004) proposed critical incident analysis as an alternative way in which

to assess the contribution of investors.
16 Several of these angel groups have been proﬁled in the scholarly literature (May and Simmons,

2001; May, 2002; Cerullo and Sommer, 2002; Payne and Mccarty, 2002; May and O’Halloran,
2003).
17 For example, in Scotland, there are estimated to be, depending on deﬁnition, between six

and 12 angel groups which invested around £40m in more than 50 companies. The leading
syndicates—for example, Archangels and Braveheart—have high visibility, including their own
web sites which list their investments, and their investments are reported in the media. Archangels
has been operating for about ten years. Its web site lists 20 investments in which they have
invested over £30m. In 2002 it invested £1.5m in six new investments and £4.3m in eight followon investments. Some of these investments were made as part of syndicated deals involving
other angel syndicates and venture capital funds. Braveheart has been operating since 1997.
It has 50 members. It has made 22 investments in 17 companies. To put the scale of their
investment in some kind of perspective, both Archangels and Braveheart now make more early
stage investments in Scotland than any single venture capital fund. Moreover, both syndicates
participate in Scottish Enterprise’s Co-investment Scheme, underlining their ‘institutional’ status.
Curiously, in England angel syndicates adopt a much lower proﬁle.
