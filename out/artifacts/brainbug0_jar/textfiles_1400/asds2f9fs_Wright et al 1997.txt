Habitual entrepreneurship is receiving growing attention, much ~¢which has
focused on entrepreneurs who have started more than one venture. This paper examines the importance (~[habitual entrepreneurs to the venture capital
industry, with particular emphasis on those who have exited from an initial
investment in the venture capitalist's portf))lio, termed serial entrepreneurs.
As venture capital markets mature, increasing numbers of entrepreneurs are
likely to exit from their initial enterprises, creating a pool of entrepreneurs with the potential ]k~rembarking
on subsequent ventures. Venture capitalists" making investments may invest both in entrepreneurs starting
new ventures and those who purchase a venture through a management buy-out or buy-in. On this wider
basis, the paper develops a classification of types ~f serial venture. A number ~[ issues are raised for
venture capitalists, notably the relative attractiveness of reinvesting in exited entrepreneurs and the polio3 ,~
they adopt in tracking and assessing such individuals.
The paper addresses venture capitalists" perspectives on investing in serial entrepreneurs' based on
a representative sample of 55 UK venture capitalists (a response rate (~f 48. 7%, and a follow-up survey
of those who had more extensive experience of serial entrepreneurs (23 respondents'). The results of the
survey show that despite a strong preference for using an entrepreneur who had played a major role in
a previous venture, the extent to which exiting entrepreneurs are funded.f?om their own port[?)lio again
is limited, though there is more extensive use of such individuals' in a consultancy capacity. In screening
entrepreneurs' exiting from previous ventures for subsequent investments, venture capitalists scored attributes relating to commercial awareness, experience in a particular sector, and personal ambition of the
entrepreneur most highly.
Venture capitalists do make extensive use of serial entrepreneurs who have exited from other venture
capitalists'por(folios, primarily to lead management buy-ins. Indications from the survey are that venture
capitalists" rarely assess entrepreneurs fiJrmally at the time of exit and that it is unusual to maintain fi~rmal
links with entrepreneurs' after they have exited. These apparent shortcomings suggest that perhaps investment opportunities are being missed. Those venture capitalists prt~fbrring serial entrepreneurs generally

had a larger volume of funds under investment and were rather older than those venture capitalists who
do not prefer to use serial entrepreneurs, reflecting the possibility that longer established venture capitalists
have had more opportunity and experience in relation to second-time entrepreneurs.
Investment appraisal factors were subject to a principal components analysis to identify underlying
dimensions~relationships between them. With respect to the general investment appraisal factors, five factors were identified. Two factors were related to track record; one of these reflected ownership experience,
while the other represented management experience. The third factor was related to personal attributes
such as age, knowledge, and family background. The fourth factor represented links to the funding institution, and the final factor (a single variable factor) concerned financial commitment. The principal components analysis for screening factors on management buy-ins produced a single factor comprising all variables. These factors were then subject to a multivariate analysis of variance (MANO VA ), with preference
for use of a serial entrepreneur as the independent variable. The results suggest that there are significant
differences between venture capitalists who prefer serial entrepreneurs and those who do not in respect
to their business ownership experience, the length of their entrepreneurial careers, and the number of
their previous ventures.
The results of the study have implications for practitioners. First, the findings emphasize the importance o f not considering previous venture experience in isolation but in the context o f other key investment
criteria. Second, the lack o f strongly greater performance from serial, versus novice, entrepreneurs further
emphasizes the care to be taken in assessing experienced entrepreneurs. Third, the relatively low degree
of formal and rigorous post-exit assessment and monitoring by venture capitalists suggests that important
opportunities to invest in experienced entrepreneurs may be missed. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Growing research effort has been devoted to entrepreneurs who found more than one
venture. Such habitual or multiple entrepreneurs may provide important insights into
the nature of entrepreneurship and raise questions concerning the relationship between
entrepreneurship experience and venture performance (MacMillan 1986; Starr and Bygrave 1991). Our concern here in examining second-time or serial entrepreneurs is explicitly with those individuals who have exited from their first venture before embarking
upon a subsequent one. Each of these ventures may have involved either the purchase
of an existing venture or establishment of a new one. This broad definition is employed
since the focus of this paper is primarily upon venture capitalists' approaches towards
serial entrepreneurs and in this context it is necessary to recognize the range of entrepreneurial activity.
While entrepreneurs exiting from one venture may have accumulated sufficient
funds to invest in subsequent ones, they are also likely to make use of venture capital,
especially if they have accessed this source of funding before. In the United States, there
has been evidence for some time that previously backed entrepreneurs are important
in generating venture capital deal flow (Silver 1985) with consideration of previous entrepreneurial experience being an element of the deal-screening process (e.g., MacMillan, Zemann, and Subbanarasimha 1987). However, there has been little explicit attention to the process by which venture capitalists screen entrepreneurs who have exited
from a previous venture and the criteria they use. Moreover, while there is some evidence concerning the extent to which founders of new businesses have previously
started a venture (see Birley and Westhead, 1994, for a review), there is little evidence
concerning the extent to which entrepreneurs existing from one venture are backed a
second or subsequent time by their financial partner. This issue assumes increasing importance as a venture capital industry matures and exits from existing investments in-

crease. The extent of such realizations is already substantial, both in the more developed
U.S. market (see, e.g., Devlin 1992; Petty, Suhlman, and Bygrave 1992) and in the United
Kingdom (EVCA 1995).
Although not all entrepreneurs leave a company when it exits from a venture capitalist's portfolio, many do. Some of these entrepreneurs will seek to start new ventures,
a number will retire, while others will go to work for someone else (Ronstadt 1988).
In addition, venture capitalists may consider that exiting entrepreneurs who are either
unsuitable for a further venture or who do wish to pursue such a route may usefully
be employed in some form of advisory role such as a nonexecutive directorship or consultancy. Among the large number of failed ventures in the recession of the 1990s, there
may be entrepreneurs who have attractions for venture capitalists because the failure
may have been beyond their control or they may have gained valuable experience
through the failure (Vesper 1980).
Serial entrepreneurs can re-enter the venture process in various ways. Much of the
debate in this emerging aspect of entrepreneurship has focused on the use of capital
proceeds from one venture in the start-up of a new firm. However, for the formal venture
capital industry, the funding of exiting entrepreneurs in the acquisition of existing businesses through a secondary management buy-out or management buy-in may be as important in terms of the volume of investments and possibly even more important in
value terms. Hence, in analyzing the importance of serial entrepreneurs to the venture
capital industry, this paper takes a broad perspective on serial entrepreneurs.
This paper examines the role of serial entrepreneurs in the venture capital industry
as follows: The next section reviews the relevant literature relating to the nature of serial
entrepreneurship and the venture capital screening process. The discussion provides
an extension of the relatively limited existing literature by developing a conceptual typology of habitual and of serial entrepreneurship based on a broad definition of entrepreneurship, which includes both the foundation and acquisition of new ventures. This
is followed by the second section, which discusses the importance of previous entrepreneurial experience within the venture capital screening process. This section extends
previous models of the venture capital process by showing that the possibility for reinvestment in exiting entrepreneurs adds a dynamic dimension previously ignored. The
third section outlines the data sources and methodology used in this study. The fourth
section presents the results of the survey of venture capitalists' perspectives in relation
to serial entrepreneurs, and the final section presents the conclusions and implications
of the research.

H A B I T U A L A N D SERIAL E N T R E P R E N E U R S
Within the continuing debate as to what is meant by entrepreneurship (see, e.g., Gartner
1985; Low and MacMillan 1988) there is growing recognition that the entrepreneurial
act may not simply involve the creation of a single venture. Instead, a full career may
see an entrepreneur become involved in a number of ventures. Serial entrepreneurship
is essentially a subset of the wider phenomenon of multiple or habitual entrepreneurship, different forms of which can be categorized as in Table 1.
In general, entrepreneurship may involve activities within an existing organization
or the formation of a new one (Cooper and Dunkelberg 1986; Robbie and Wright 1996).
In particular, the relatively recent development of management buy-outs and buy-ins
suggests the possibility for entrepreneurial acts in organizations that already exist (Bull

In addition, examination of the characteristics of the leading individuals in buy-out and
buy-in transactions identifies similar features to those found in respect to entrepreneurs
who start new ventures, with buy-in entrepreneurs generally having more proactive features than their counterparts in buy-outs (Ennew et al. 1994). Entrepreneurship may
also involve cases where the entrepreneur becomes an owner of the organization or is
a manager with little or no ownership stake as in corporate entrepreneurship (Block
and MacMillan 1993; Stopford and Baden-Fuller 1994).
Habitual and multiple entrepreneurship focuses on the dynamics of these entrepreneurial actions. However, there has hitherto been little attempt to identify the different
types of habitual entrepreneurial activity. In their pioneering study, Starr and Bygrave
(1991) take a general view of multiple venture experience. Hall (1995), in discussing
habitual or multiple business founders, distinguishes portfolio owners (Quadrant 4 of
Table 1), where ownership of the first venture is maintained when a subsequent venture
is embarked upon, from serial owners who dispose of one venture before founding another (Quadrant 2). Although there is some evidence to show that habitual portfolio
entrepreneurship is extensive (e.g., Birley and Westhead 1994), there is little empirical
research that distinguishes between portfolio and serial entrepreneurs or that embraces
other forms of entrepreneurship beyond start-ups. 1 Furthermore, the portfolio serial
categorization may be too simplistic in light of recent developments in entrepreneurship
theory and should perhaps be broadened to include activities relating to existing firms.
Multiple corporate entrepreneurship (Quadrant 3) may occur within the same firm or
by the entrepreneurial managers concerned moving to another firm, in both cases to
engage in further acts of new resource deployment. Conversely, serial entrepreneurship
could involve the purchase of an existing firm after the first venture is sold (Quadrant
1). Serial entrepreneurial behavior may be considered to be firstly a desire to exit from
an initial venture when entrepreneurial opportunities are perceived to have been exhausted and to search for new possibilities through entry into a subsequent venture.
Quadrants 1 and 2 of Table 1 can be expanded to identify more specifically the
different forms of serial entrepreneurship as shown in Table 2. Essentially, the categories of second-time entrepreneurship may be represented as2repeating entrepreneurial
experience with the same enterprise--that is, selling out from whatever form the initial
~An exception, for example, is Kolvereid and Bulvag (1993), who examine portfolio entrepreneurs who
start more than one business.
2These are the three main forms of serial entrepreneurship, although it is recognized that serial entrepreneurs may make minority and/or part-time investments as business angels and may have a comparative advantage over formal venture capitalists in making helpful contributions in operational and strategic functional
areas of an enterprise's activity, though there may be difficulties in the process of searching and matching
investors with investments (Harrison and Mason 1992).

venture took and then buying it, or part of it, back (a secondary MBO); repeating entrepreneurial experience by leading a new venture involving a company that already exists
and that may (a pure management buy-in, MBI) or may not (a buy-in/buy-out, BIMBO)
involve incumbent management in equity ownership; and repeating the entrepreneurial
experience with an entirely new company (a start-up).
Repeating an entrepreneurial experience with an entirely new company is generally regarded as the classic case of serial entrepreneurship (Birley and Westhead 1994).
However, serial entrepreneurship may also entail re-establishing a relationship with a
previously owned company. An entrepreneur may remain with an initial venture when
it is sold and subsequently buy it back either because the acquisition fails to fit into
the parent organization or because the parent experiences major trading difficulties.
Alternatively, the entrepreneur may perceive an opportunity to buy-out part of the business that she or he considers to have growth prospects but that does not fit strategically
with the new parent. Entrepreneurs may also seek to re-establish ownership to make
good their sense of loss from having sold out in the first place (Petty et al. 1992).
Management buy-ins provide a further medium for serial entrepreneurship. Evidence indicates that well over a quarter of buy-in team leaders had previously owned
a significant equity stake in a company in which they had been employed. Although
such investments have many of the features of start-ups, they do involve an existing
organizational structure. Typically, significant entrepreneurial input is required to turn
around an enterprise subject to a buy-in (Robbie and Wright 1996). However, entrepreneurs entering buy-ins may be faced with potentially severe asymmetric information
and adverse selection problems. Previous experience with a buy-in may alert entrepreneurs to the existence of these problems, though they may still be unable to assess the
nature of them e x a n t e in a new venture. For these reasons experienced entrepreneurs
may seek to complement less entrepreneurially experienced incumbent management,
creating a hybrid buy-in/buy-out (so-called BIMBO).
As Table 2 indicates, serial entrepreneurs may pursue a second venture similar to
their first or may shift their focus of attention. Shifts may occur, for example, where
entrepreneurs, having exited from and turned around a buy-out, may seek a similar
challenge by buying into an already existing company or, perhaps less likely given their
experience, by creating a new company. Similarly, entrepreneurs having started and
grown a company may seek to buy into an underperforming company with growth prospects in order to achieve a larger entity relatively quickly rather than starting totally
afresh. Where serial entrepreneurship involves successive buy-ins, successive buy-outs.
or some combination of the two, then venture capital is likely to be involved: this in

turn raises issues concerning the process by which serial entrepreneurs are evaluated
both by their initial venture capitalist and by other potential venture capital funders.

VENTURE CAPITALIST ASSESSMENT
A number of studies have developed models of the venture capital appraisal process
(e.g., Bruno and Tyebjee 1985; Bygrave and Timmons 1992; Fried and Hisrich 1994),
an example of which is shown in Figure 1. (This figure is adapted by the present authors
from Fried and Hisrich, 1994.) In general this research does not explicitly distinguish
the criteria used by those venture capitalists who prefer to invest in experienced entrepreneurs and those who do not. The existence of entrepreneurs who are exiting from
venture capitalists' owns portfolios adds a feedback loop to the source of deal generation
in Figure 1, and also raises issues concerning the nature of the process by which venture
capitalists assess exiting entrepreneurs with a view to reinvestment. From Figure 1, the
stages in the process as regards serial entrepreneurs can be conceptualized as involving
the following: exit of the entrepreneur at the time of venture capitalist exit or afterwards
with assessment by the venture capitalist for potential reinvestment; post-exit monitoring by the venture capitalist if reinvestment does not occur on exit; screening of entrepreneurs, together with novice entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs exited from other venture capitalists' portfolios, with a view to investment; and deal negotiation and
completion.
Several studies examine the relative importance of the factors taken into account
in the screening process for new venture investment (e.g., Bruno and Tyebjee 1985;
MacMillan, Siegel, and Subbanarasimha 1985; MacMillan et al. 1987). An entrepreneur's past experience is undoubtedly of importance, although it is only one among
many criteria used in the screening process. MacMillan et al. (1987) show that the most
important criteria used by venture capitalists in screening investment proposals were
entrepreneurial personality and experience, with lesser dependence being placed on
market, product, and strategy. The particular attraction of past experience in the context
of screening is the potential reduction in adverse selection problems because of the information contained in past and potentially similar experience. Where such experience
relates directly to entrepreneurial activity, it will be of particular value.
This suggests the following propositions:
Proposition la: Venture capitalists who express a preference for investing in experienced entrepreneurs will place greater emphasis on previous entrepreneurial experience than those who do not have such a preference.
Proposition lb: Venture capitalists will evaluate first-time entrepreneurs and serial
entrepreneurs differently.

Of course, it is important to recognize the assets and liabilities of past experience
(Starr and Bygrave 1991, 1992; Starr, Bygrave, and Tercanli 1993). Previous venture
experience may have both positive and negative features. Positive features include reputation, expertise, and networks of contacts. Negative features include reduced motivation to work as hard or to take on risky projects, and fixation on previous success/failure
factors (blinders) that may not be appropriate for the new venture. These studies suggest
that the negative features of experience are likely to lead to experienced entrepreneurs
not implementing resourceful strategies and using resources parsimoniously. In the con-

text of repeat management buy-outs, the danger may be that entrepreneurs take the
same actions in an attempt to repeat their previous success though the conditions surrounding the enterprise may have changed. It may be expected that if the process is
working effectively, venture capitalists will assess both the assets and the liabilities of
an individual entrepreneur's previous experience and invest in only those cases where
the former exceed the latter. Hence the proposition:
Proposition 2: Venture capitalists will assess the net benefits of previous experience

and target those entrepreneurs where the assets of previous experience exceed liabilities.
Starr and Bygrave also propose that the positive experience of previous entrepreneurial ventures should make it easier to raise start-up financing per se and in larger
amounts. However, they do not distinguish between raising further finance from existing
sources or from alternative possibilities, which may be important. At the initial investment stage, entrepreneurs are unlikely to be fully conversant with the workings of venture capitalists, hence among other things the widespread use of financial intermediaries. For the venture capitalist, there is a potential adverse selection problem in
contracting with novice entrepreneurs that the above screening mechanisms are designed to obviate. At the initial stage, venture capitalists may see themselves as able to
negotiate relatively advantageous terms compared to the entrepreneur. In recontracting
with entrepreneurs who have exited from their own firm's portfolio, venture capitalists
are potentially faced with a situation where the entrepreneur is more aware than previously of the effectiveness of the venture capitalist's monitoring and of how (dis)advantageous the initial contract was. There is essentially a multi-period game whereby serial
entrepreneurs will seek to shift the distribution of expected gains in their favor.
With respect to entrepreneurs who have exited from other venture capitalists' portfolios, the contracting problem is more complicated as the entrepreneur now has knowledge about the venture capital negotiating process in general, though not of the venture
capitalist to whom an approach is being made for the first time. Moreover, while venture
capitalists may know the entrepreneurs who have exited from their own portfolios, they
are still faced by potential adverse selection problems in respect of entrepreneurs who
have exited from other venture capitalists' portfolios. Hence the following propositions
are suggested:
Proposition 3a: As a result of the potential for recontracting problems, venture capi-

talists will be cautious about reinvesting in experienced entrepreneurs from their
own portfolios.
Proposition 3b: Venture capitalists will be cautious about investing in entrepreneurs
who have exited from other venture capitalists' portfolios because of recontracting
problems relating to both asymmetric information and the entrepreneurs knowledge
of the negotiation process.

Ultimately, the key question is whether entrepreneurial experience affects performance. The implications of ownership experience for the performance of serial entrepreneurs are surrounded by a degree of ambiguity. Vesper (1980) found that a variety
of entrepreneurial and functional experience, including prior failure, was an indicator
of better performance. Stuart and Abetti (1990) find that the most significant influence
on performance was the level of managerial experience in previous ventures. Studies
that have specifically examined cases of experienced, versus novice, entrepreneurs are

Overview
The use of exiting entrepreneurs in further ventures by the same institution appears
limited. A n u m b e r of institutions responding to the survey considered that it was too
soon for them to have had significant, if any, experience of using entrepreneurs again, ~
although others also stated that the data were not available. 6 The 28 institutions that
responded to this part of the first survey indicated that less than 5 % of previously funded
entrepreneurs were funded in any subsequent venture by the same institution. Indeed,
over three-quarters (77.1%) of the lead entrepreneurs in previously backed investments
were not used again by the venture capitalist in any capacity. Where previously funded
lead entrepreneurs were used, it was usually in an informal advisory consultancy
(13.1%) role or as a non-executive director in a new venture (5.5%).
The most important reason given by venture capitalists for the low extent to which
they invested again in entrepreneurs who had previously been supported was the view
that no suitable candidates had emerged. This factor seems particularly important
a m o n g smaller c o m p a n i e s ] which might reflect the ability of larger organizations to attract a good pool of potential entrepreneurs. The second most important reason cited
was that venture capitalists had not actively pursued entrepreneurs who had exited with
a view to making new investments with them. The operation of formal policies of not
reinvesting in the same entrepreneur or of only using them in other consultancy, nonexecutive, due-diligence roles was generally seen as unimportant. There was no evidence of any significant difference in the degree of importance attached to any of these
three factors by small and large venture capitalists.
Evidence from the second survey suggests that even when proposals are received
from potential serial entrepreneurs, they are often found wanting. Twelve respondents
had declined to invest in a proposal brought by an entrepreneur who had exited from
their portfolio. Proposals that were viewed as not being viable (M: 4.46; SD: 0.93, on
a scale where 5 = very important to 1 = irrelevant/very unimportant) or that did not
m e e t current investment criteria (M: 4.09; SD: 0.94) received the highest scored reasons
for being turned down. Personal (M: 2.82; SD: 1.25) and financial motivations (M: 2.91 ;
SD: 1.45), unreasonable negotiating demands (M: 2.82; SD: 1.54), and attempts to repeat
a previously successful approach in an inappropriate situation (M: 3.00; SD: 0.89) were
all viewed to be of little importance. There was some slight indication that serial entrepreneurs may be rejected when they attempt a venture that is beyond their skills (M:
3.08; SD: 0.90).
Funding serial entrepreneurship is not restricted to the funding of an organization's
own exited entrepreneurs; it may also be manifested in the funding of entrepreneurs
who have exited from ventures funded by competitors. Slightly over half the sample
of venture capitalists (52.9%) had made use of entrepreneurs who had exited from inST-testswere conducted for significant differences between the characteristics of respondents who provided information on their usage of serial entrepreneurs and those who did not. There was no evidence of
differences between the two groups at conventional levels of significance. Absolute t-valuesranged from 0.09
to 1.55.
6To test whether this was significantlyrelated to size of portfolio we tested for significant differences
and found that although non-respondents were larger, they were not significantlyso.
7Smallorganizations are those with less than the median number of executives. Between the mean score
in respect to no suitable candidates having emerged was significantly smaller for larger organizations (M:
3.5: SD: 1.4) than for smaller ones (M: 4.9; SD: 0.37), with a t-value of 3.52.

vestments funded by other venture capitalists. The median use of entrepreneurs had
been 3, although there was considerable variation around this level. Almost half (48.0%)
of lead serial entrepreneurs were used to lead a buy-in, BIMBO, or buy-out. Well over
half (55.6%) of other entrepreneurial team members were being used in a formal supporting executive director role, with finance directors being particularly prominent.
Almost three-quarters of venture capitalists in the sample (40 out of 55) claimed
to prefer to finance an entrepreneur who has played a major role in a previous venture.
The most important reasons for preferring entrepreneurs with previous venture experience are shown in Table 4. The most important reason emerging is that previous experience provides a track record, followed by demonstrated motivation. Some importance
was attached to the view that such managers were more likely to achieve success again.
There is no evidence to suggest that there is any systematic relationship between
preference for using serial entrepreneurs and the characteristics of the individual venture capitalist, as the results in Table 5 show. s In particular, there is evidence of considerable similarity in the composition of portfolios in terms of both number and value of
investments. However, it is noticeable that those venture capitalists preferring serial
entrepreneurs do appear generally to have a larger volume of funds under investment
and to be rather older than those venture capitalists that do not prefer to use serial
entrepreneurs. This may simply reflect the fact that the longer established (and often
larger) venture capitalists have had more opportunity and experience in relation to second-time entrepreneurs.
It was shown earlier that many venture capitalists do not actively pursue entrepreneurs who have exited with a view to investing in new deals. Evidence from the questionnaire responses suggests that the nature of any continuing or developing relationship
is mainly of an informal/social or ad hoc nature. Other more systematic approaches, such
as active procedures to monitor post-venture activities, formal assessment of managers'
performance, and feedback of performance into proposal evaluations, were identified
as relatively unimportant means of developing the relationship. Indeed, only 17% of
SBecause of the interdependent nature of the proportions of venture capitalists' portfolios that are invested in each investment stage, we used M A N O V A to test for differences between those venture capitalists
who prefer serial entrepreneurs and those who do not. Since proportions data sum to one, the M A N O V A
was performed using only 4 of the 5 possible dependent variables. There was no evidence of any significant
differences between the two groups. In addition a rank-order correlation coefficient was calculated based
on the rankings associated with each of the five investment stages. A value of 0.9 (p = .04) for the distribution
by volume and 1.0 (p = .00) for the distribution by value, indicates considerable similarity between the two
groups and confirms the findings of the M A N O V A . We are grateful to a referee for this point.

Screening of Serial Entrepreneurs
Propositions la and lb deal with issues surrounding the screening and evaluation of
entrepreneurs and differences according to the type of entrepreneur and the preferences of the venture capitalist. Evaluating Proposition la requires a comparison of two
groups of venture capitalists across a set of screening criteria. Clearly, the criteria used
in investment appraisal are not independent, and relationships between some, if not
all, criteria would be expected. Consequently, simple univariate tests on each criterion
would be inappropriate. Accordingly, a multivariate approach that accommodates the
effects of interdependence between criteria was preferred. The first stage in this analysis
was to subject both sets of investment appraisal factors to a principal components analysis to identify underlying dimensions/relationships between these factors. With respect
to the general investment appraisal factors, the principal components analysis identified
five factors accounting for 70% of the variance. A varimax rotation suggested that two
factors were related to track record; one of these reflected ownership experience while
the other represented management experience. The third factor was related to personal
attributes such as age, knowledge, and family background. The fourth factor represented links to the funding institution, and the final factor (a single variable factor) concerned financial commitment. The principal components analysis for screening factors
on management buy-ins produced a single factor comprising all variables. Thus, it was
decided that this set of variables should be treated as measuring a single dimension.
The five investment appraisal factors and the one management buy-in screening
factor were then subject to a multivariate analysis of variance ( M A N O V A ) , with preference for use of a serial entrepreneur as the independent variable. The results of these
analyses are shown in Tables 6 and 7. Table 6 presents the results for general screening
factors. In most instances, there is no evidence of any significant differences in the rating
applied to each factor across the two groups of venture capitalists. However, in relation
to previous ownership experience, there are some differences that might be considered
marginally significant. As might be expected, previous ownership experience, length of

Table 7 presents the results for the analysis of management buy-in screening. The
overall analysis suggests that there are no significant differences between the two
groups, although there is some evidence to suggest a marginally significant difference
in relation to the assessment of managers' contributions to target achievements, with
those venture capitalists preferring to use serial entrepreneurs scoring this factor significantly higher than those who do not.
Thus, the evidence to support Proposition la appears weak. There is some tentative
indication of a preference for the use of serial entrepreneurs among the older and larger

less sanguine. Birley and Westhead (1994) found no evidence to suggest that new businesses established by habitual founders are particularly advantaged compared to their
more inexperienced counterparts. Kolvereid and Bullvag (1993) examine differences
between novice and experienced business founders where experienced entrepreneurs
still own their original business. They are also unable to identify performance differences between the two types of entrepreneur. There are no indications from these studies that entrepreneurs in established subsequent ventures had been subject to scrutiny
by venture capitalists as to previous experience and performance. The discussion relating to earlier propositions suggests that, in the case of serial entrepreneurs, during the
screening process venture capitalists will need, and be more able, to satisfy themselves
that experienced entrepreneurs still have the motivation to perform, and that experienced entrepreneurs will perform at least as well as thev did before and at least as well
as inexperienced entrepreneurs. Hence the following proposition is suggested:

Proposition 4: Venture-backed serial entrepreneurs are expected to perform both at
least as well as they did in their own first venture and as well as novice entrepreneurs. 3
The following sections examine evidence on the extent and nature of investment
in serial entrepreneurs by venture capitalists and seek to test the above propositions.
Because little is yet known about the links between venture capitalists and serial entrepreneurs, we also place emphasis on basic information describing the phenomenon.

DATA AND METHODOLOGY
In order to assess the extent and nature of usage of serial entrepreneurs, data were collected by means of two postal questionnaires? The first survey was carried out at the end
of 1992 and beginning of 1993. A draft questionnaire was developed and subsequently
piloted with a number of venture capitalists, advisors, and academics. The scales used
in the questionnaire concerning the criteria used to assess entrepreneurs were developed from a review of the existing literature and from discussions with the main participants in the venture capital industry. Following analysis of the replies, modifications
were made to the content and structure of the questionnaire.
The first questionnaire was mailed to the 113 institutions then listed as full members
of the British Venture Capital Association. The questionnaires were sent to Chief Executives of the venture capital or senior colleagues with whom C M B O R has regular contact through its buy-out and buy-in surveys. Mailing of the questionnaires was undertaken in early December 1992. A follow-up reminder was sent in January 1993. In total,
55 completed and usable replies were received, representing a response rate of 48.7%.
Ten respondents were CEO's, 22 were directors, and the remainder were assistant directors or equivalent. A further 13 replies were received with reasons for non-completion
stated. These reasons generally related to the immaturity of a particular venture capitalist's portfolio, a deliberate policy not to answer questionnaires, or the fact that the com3An offsetting effect is that while an experience effect ought to exist and operate as in Proposition 4,
there may be some regression to the mean whereby especially high performers revert to a more usual level
of performance. Whereas the regression to the mean would benefit the worst performers (whowouldbe likely
to improve in their second try, even if experience taught them nothing), rather fewer of those failed entrepreneurs will receive venture capital the second time around. We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for
this point.

panies were no longer involved in venture capital. Comparative demographics of respondents and non-respondents are shown in Table 3 where data could be identified.
The only significant difference between the respondents and non-respondents for whom
data were available related to the total value of investments at cost.
Analysis of the responding institutions revealed that they covered a substantial proportion of the UK venture capital industry. Virtually all the principal and longest established venture capitalists in the UK had participated in the study. The venture capital
firms in the sample had made 2,354 venture capital investments over the period 1990-92
worth over £3.5 billion.
A second questionnaire was specifically targeted at those venture capitalists who
had experience of serial entrepreneurs as revealed by the first survey. The scales covered
in this second questionnaire were derived from the existing literature relating to habitual
entrepreneurship, notably Starr and Bygrave (1991), who suggest a number of positive
and negative aspects of entrepreneurial experience. This questionnaire was piloted as
for the first, and during this process considerable resistance to the provision of data on
numbers and types of serial entrepreneurs funded by venture capitalists was identified.
The problem essentially was due to the time involved in searching documentation for
such information. As a result this question was dropped and accordingly we are unable
to provide data on this aspect of serial entrepreneurs.
The second questionnaire was mailed to the 40 venture capitalists in the first sample
who stated on the first questionnaire that they had either invested in an entrepreneur
who had exited from their own and/or another venture capitalist's portfolio. This survey
yielded 23 usable responses. Evidence from returned but uncompleted questionnaires
and from the researchers' follow-up telephone contacts with potential respondents indicated that although these venture capitalists had experience with serial entrepreneurs
they considered it to be too limited to draw general conclusions.

RESULTS
The initial discussion of results concentrates on providing a general overview of the
nature of serial entrepreneurship as revealed by the two surveys. Thereafter, specific
analysis is presented to address the propositions advanced earlier.

venture capital organizations, but there is little evidence to suggest that this preference
is then reflected in any substantive differences in investment appraisal across the
two groups.
In order to analyze Proposition lb, which suggests that venture capitalists place
emphasis on different attributes of first time and serial entrepreneurs, respondents were
asked to score 10 factors, derived from the existing literature, that may be important
in assessing their investment potential. As Table 8 shows, there is a high degree of similarity in the ways in which the two types of entrepreneur are assessed, with only management skills and ability to cope with stress being identified as significantly more important
in the assessment of first-time entrepreneurs than in the assessment of career entrepreneurs. In both cases, the three most important factors were leadership skills, management skills, and the achievement of sales/finance targets. For both types of entrepreneurs, time to exit was the least important factor. For first-time entrepreneurs, relatively
more importance was placed on ability to cope with venture stress and being enterprisedriven than was the case for career entrepreneurs. Correspondingly, venture capitalists
placed relatively more emphasis on the creation of commercial opportunities, an ability
to meet timescales, being financially driven, and financial commitment for serial entrepreneurs.
This suggests that, as was the case with Proposition 1a, the evidence for Proposition
lb is weak; the weights associated with different screening criteria do not differ substantially between first-time and serial entrepreneurs, despite the potential for adverse selection problems to be lower for the latter group.

Assets and Liabilities of Serial Entrepreneurship
Proposition 2 concerns the extent to which venture capitalists weigh the assets and liabilities of serial entrepreneurship. Using a scale containing variables derived from Starr
and Bygrave (1991) and responses from the second questionnaire, venture capitalists
generally report that the previous entrepreneurial experience of serial entrepreneurs
in whom they have invested is an asset rather than a liability (Table 9), with the ability to
build on expertise in running an independent business and on reputation as a successful
entrepreneur scoring particularly highly. Ability to identify business networks appropriate to a particular situation and ability to adapt expertise to new circumstances also
score highly. The main factor relating to the negative aspects of previous experience

to score highly was that serial entrepreneurs were generally reported as being unable
to recognize their own limitations. Reliance on networks that were successful in a first
venture, which may be positive or negative, also scored reasonably highly. Note that
these responses relate to serial entrepreneurs in whom venture capitalists had invested,
suggesting an awareness by them of the positive and negative aspects of experience with
those with negative attributes not receiving subsequent backing, an outcome that provides some evidence to support Proposition 2.
Recontracting Issues
Propositions 3a and 3b deal with the issue of recontracting and suggest that venture
capitalists may be cautious about reinvesting in serial entrepreneurs as a consequence
of the knowledge and experience of the negotiating process that those entrepreneurs
have. Tentative support for Proposition 3a (entrepreneurs from the venture capitalists'
own portfolio) is provided by the descriptive statistics presented earlier that reveal a
low level of use of previously funded entrepreneurs. Indeed, where venture capitalists
had made use of entrepreneurs whom they had previously backed, it was relatively unusual for them to be used as participants in buy-outs, buy-ins, or start-ups. The use made
of entrepreneurs in management buy-outs, buy-ins, and BIMBOs accounted for only
2.6% of former lead entrepreneurs and 0.5% of other entrepreneurial team members.
More in evidence was the role of the exiting entrepreneur in an informal or part-time
context. Thus for both lead entrepreneurs and other members, the single most important
area of subsequent involvement was in an informal advisory role. There was little evidence of any systematic variation in the use of previously funded entrepreneurs across
different institutions. While generally the larger venture capital firms made more use
of previously funded entrepreneurs (particularly in buy-outs and in the role of director),
the observed differences were not statistically significant.

Evidence for Proposition 3b is perhaps slightly weaker. Over 50% of respondents
to the first survey indicated that they used entrepreneurs who had previously been
funded by another venture capitalist; almost half of these entrepreneurs were funded
for genuine serial entrepreneurship, that is, leading a buy-in, buy-out, or BIMBO. When
compared to usage of entrepreneurs from the venture capitalists' own portfolio, there
is evidence of a substantial difference, which would tend to suggest that venture capitalists see recontracting as less problematic with entrepreneurs previously funded by a different venture capitalist.
Further evidence for Proposition 3a and 3b comes from the second survey. Major
differences between first-time and serial entrepreneurs in negotiations were identified
and provide some support for the concerns venture capitalists were suggested to have
about serial recontracting (Table 10). The ability of serial entrepreneurs to understand
the venture capital process better received the highest score. Difficulties in negotiations
were signaled by the ability of serial entrepreneurs to foresee the venture capitalists'
negotiating techniques, their ability to find other funders, and their ability to obtain a
higher equity stake, which were the second, third, and fourth highest scores, respectively. Other potential problem areas--such as running an auction of funders, insisting
on a greater say in the timing and nature of exit, and vetoing syndicate m e m b e r s h i p - figured less highly, and insisting on hands-off monitoring scored lowest.
In cases where venture capitalists negotiated with experienced entrepreneurs who
had exited from another venture capitalist's portfolio, there was little evidence to suggest a preference for this kind of individual, even though there seems to be a higher
incidence of such investment (Table 11). There was no clear agreement with the view
that an entrepreneur who was seeking to change venture capitalist is likely to be a potential problem and so there was need for great caution; nor was there clear agreement
or disagreement that venture capitalists saw themselves as more able to negotiate acceptable terms with an entrepreneur in whom they had not invested before. Venture
capitalists expressed some disagreement that they had had more suitable proposals from
entrepreneurs who had exited from other venture capitalists' portfolios than from their
own. Venture capitalists may or may not have considered investing in the individuals
concerned the first time around and did not particularly take the view that entrepreneurs

<-----Page 17----->244

changing venture capitalist were demonstrating initiative that suggested that they were
motivated to succeed in a second deal.
Thus, as was the case with the results of the first survey, the data from the second
survey appears to provide some support for recontracting problems when venture capitalists deal with entrepreneurs from their own portfolios, but the extent of such difficulties seems rather less in the case of entrepreneurs from the portfolios of other venture capitalists.

Performance
Proposition 4 concerns performance and the extent to which serial entrepreneurs perform similarly or better when compared either with their first venture or with novice
entrepreneurs. The results of the second survey suggest that in terms of performance
in the second venture in comparison to that in the first, there was little evidence of much
difference (Table 12). There was little indication that profit performance was better in
the second than in the first or that sales growth was worse. However, venture capitalists
scored their preparedness to support serial entrepreneurs in a third venture in the same
capacity reasonably highly. Venture capitalists did not report serial entrepreneurs performing better than first-time entrepreneurs in whom they invested in the same period.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study have implications for both academics and practitioners. The
study suggests that the extent to which venture capitalists use previously funded entrepreneurs is relatively low compared to the number of investments harvested. This relatively low use of entrepreneurs in subsequent investments may be at least partially attributable to type of harvesting (e.g., entrepreneurs are more likely to leave their
venture at the time of its sale to another company than at the time of an IPO); contractual arrangements made following the sale of a business between the selling entrepreneurs and the new owners (e.g., new management contracts, legal restraints on setting
on competing businesses); the attitudes of entrepreneurs to being involved in secondT A B L E 11

time ventures; and their assessment of the venture capital firm and process. Thus entrepreneurs who sell their business may retain a formal management position with the new
owners or decide to pursue some totally different activity not involving a venture capitalist or wish to pursue a venture but with an alternative financing structure. Higher levels
of personal wealth resulting from a successful sale of their first business may enable
the second-time entrepreneur to avoid the use of venture capital finance in the initial
stages of a second venture, although she or he may require such finance at a later point
to fund growth, depending on the initial size and stage of the new venture. Additionally
there may have been a significant change in the relative bargaining powers of the entrepreneur and venture capitalist that may make it more difficult for the venture capitalist
to accept, for instance, the equity shares being demanded by the now financially wealthy
second-time entrepreneur.
The results lend some support to the Starr and Bygrave (1991, 1992) observation
about the assets and liabilities of experience. There was some concern on the part of
venture capitalists as to whether exiting entrepreneurs can perform a second time either
because they lose motivation or are unable to repeat the initial conditions. The study
showed that in terms of appraisal of entrepreneurs, both in general and in respect of
those experienced entrepreneurs exiting from initial investments, venture capitalists
generally claimed to prefer to finance an entrepreneur who had played a major role
in a previous venture. Multivariate analysis showed that previous ownership, length of
entrepreneurial career, and number of previous ventures were rather more important
for those venture capitalists who expressed a preference for serial entrepreneurs. Previous experience was viewed as being important in providing a track record, followed by
demonstrated motivation. Some importance was attached to the view that experienced
entrepreneurs were more likely to achieve success again, although this factor was not
rated as highly as entrepreneurial ambition and motivation. Although previous ownership experience is of some importance, it is not in itself a critical factor, because indications are that venture capitalists will need to be satisfied that experienced entrepreneurs

<-----Page 19----->246

still have the motivation, ambition, and managerial skills to succeed in a subsequent
venture. These points may be especially true of entrepreneurs exiting from a management buy-out, who typically may be reacting to the presentation of a one-off opportunity
in the enterprise in which they find themselves. The views of those venture capitalists
who had experience of serial entrepreneurs indicated a generally positive view of previous experience, apart from entrepreneurs' inability to recognize their own limitations.
This suggests that venture capitalists have been careful about screening out those entrepreneurs who do not meet their criteria.
The effects of the extent and nature of scrutiny of experienced and novice entrepreneurs is reflected in the evidence relating to venture capitalists' perceptions of performance. While experienced entrepreneurs performed slightly better on average in their
second ventures in terms of profits, it is less clear that they performed better than novice
entrepreneurs in whom the venture capitalists invested during the same period. These
findings are consistent with more general studies of habitual entrepreneurs by Birley
and Westhead (1994) and Kolvereid and Bullvag (1993).
The use made of other venture capitalists' ex-entrepreneurs may reflect such factors as the ability of more seasoned entrepreneurs to purchase their finance in a more
sophisticated way, the type of finance required, concerns over the way the harvesting
process was managed, disputes over equity ratchets, or more fundamental problems
in the personal relationship between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur. The
departing venture capitalist will also be more aware of the limitations of the entrepreneur that may not be so apparent to the new venture capitalist who will have been impressed by the track record. Additionally, the departing venture capitalist, through his
or her personal experience with the entrepreneur, may make a different judgment from
another venture capitalist about the abilities of the entrepreneur to move from, for example, a management buy-out to a management buy-in where different types of managerial and entrepreneurial skills are required. Nevertheless, the evidence implies that
the lack of systematic follow-up of entrepreneurs backed by a venture capitalist may
be presenting opportunities for competitor venture capital firms rather than allowing
the original backer to generate new investments.
There was evidence from the follow-up survey that venture capitalists exercise caution when renegotiating with experienced entrepreneurs from their own portfolios, notably because of entrepreneurs' greater awareness of the venture capitalists' negotiating
techniques, greater understanding of the process, and ability to obtain a higher stake.
However, reasons for rejection appeared to be more related to the absence of a viable
proposal or changes in investment criteria rather than unreasonable demands by entrepreneurs, but this also needs to be seen in terms of the changes over time in the type
of deal sought by the venture capital firm and their targeted returns. Venture capitalists
appeared to be more cautious than expected in negotiating and investing in entrepreneurs from other venture capitalists' portfolios.
To the extent that serial entrepreneurs are becoming more in evidence, further
research may usefully be directed at consideration of the views of venture capitalists
in relation to the characteristics and motivations of the entrepreneurs involved. Examination of issues concerning the processes by which entrepreneurs enter into subsequent
ventures, from the perspective of the entrepreneurs, may help in understanding the phenomenon. These issues relate to consideration of whether entrepreneurs move directly
to a subsequent venture or only arrive at it after a period of search or employment in
a larger group. There is also a need to examine the nature of the serial entrepreneur's

search process and, in order to counterbalance the views of venture capitalists, the extent to which and the reasons why serial entrepreneurs do or do not retain advisers and
financiers who were involved in the initial ventures in subsequent ones.
In addition, although four broad categories of habitual entrepreneur were identified at the outset, this p a p e r has only examined one subset. There would thus appear
to be further scope for examination of the other types, comparison of the characteristics
of the entrepreneurs involved, and analysis of their performance effects. One particular
implication stems from the importance of venture capitalists in screening entrepreneurs
prior to reinvestment with the aims of identifying cases where the assets of previous
experience exceed the liabilities and of attempting to ensure that viable opportunities
are funded. In the cases of multiple corporate entrepreneurship and portfolio entrepreneurship, there is a need to examine the existence and effectiveness of any parallel
screening mechanisms. For example, in corporations one may envisage an analysis of
the governance mechanisms (including incentive systems) applied when m a n a g e m e n t
undertakes repeat projects requiring entrepreneurial actions. In the case of portfolio
entrepreneurs, there may be no independent screening of new projects where entrepreneurs are able to use the resources of the firm to finance new developments. A similar
issue arises in the case of serial entrepreneurs who do not raise external finance in order
to fund their subsequent ventures. Further comparative research of differences in performance of repeat projects undertaken where independent screening occurs, as documented in this paper, and in respect to the other cases shown in Table 1, where such
screening may not be present or may take a different form, may provide useful insights
for both researchers and practitioners.
The results of the study have a n u m b e r of implications for practitioners. First, the
findings emphasize the importance of not considering previous venture experience in
isolation but in the context of other key investment variables. Second, the lack of
strongly greater performance from serial, versus novice, entrepreneurs, which is consistent with that from other studies, further emphasizes the care to be taken in assessing
experienced entrepreneurs. Third, the relatively low degree of formal and rigorous postexit assessment and monitoring by venture capitalists suggests that they may be missing
important opportunities to invest in experienced entrepreneurs.
