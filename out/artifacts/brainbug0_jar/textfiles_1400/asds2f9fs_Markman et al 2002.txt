THINKING, PERSEVERANCE,
AND SELF-EFFICACY IN
VENTURE FORMATION

INTRODUCTION
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) and Venkataraman (1997) suggest that the field
of entrepreneurship seeks to understand how opportunities are discovered, created,
and exploited, by whom, and with what consequences (italic added). Surprisingly
and despite the fact that the person – the entrepreneur – is central to the creation
of new ventures, entrepreneurship scholars are reluctant to explicitly include
individual differences in formal models of new venture formation. For example,
notwithstanding the important role that entrepreneurs play in forging new
wealth and creating new jobs, research to identify cognitive processes, attitudes,
behaviors, traits, or other characteristics that distinguish entrepreneurs from others
who opt to work as employees remains somewhat marginal. Indeed, only very
few studies on individual differences have been published in leading management
journals. One possible explanation for this reluctance is that in the past researchers
might have classified most individual differences as traits research and thus
criticism spilled over to include all individual difference research, regardless of

whether the focus was trait, cognitions, emotions, attitudes, behaviors, or other
characteristics.
The goal of this paper is to employ a rigorous methodology in order to assess
the impact of several individual difference factors (factors possessing a firm
foundation in existing theory and empirical findings) on individuals’ decision
to use their inventions (i.e. patents) to start new ventures. Indeed, a more recent
research stream suggests that individual differences might play an important role
in entrepreneurship (Baum, Locke & Smith, 2001). To mention a few studies,
Shane (2000) found that individuals from diverse technological backgrounds who
assess the same technological invention (e.g. 3DP™ ) recognize and then develop
very different business opportunities. Sarasvathy, Simon and Lave (1999) used
verbal protocols to illustrate that entrepreneurs evaluate and process information
differently from bankers. Additional evidence suggests that entrepreneurs, as
compared with managers, may perceive and react to risk differently; entrepreneurs
gathered significantly less information, utilized less formal techniques to analyze
problems, and followed less rational decision processes than managers did
(Busenitz, 1999; Busenitz & Barney, 1997). In contrast, Kaish and Gilad (1991)
found that entrepreneurs spent considerably more time searching for information
and paid attention to different risk cues than did executives of established firms.
Studying several biases such as illusion of control and the belief in the law of
small numbers, Simon, Houghton and Aquino (2000) suggest that entrepreneurs
might not realize that certain tasks are beyond their control. Others noted that
entrepreneurs tend to make quick decisions (Bird, 1988; Eisenhardt, 1989;
Stevenson, Grousbeck, Roberts & Bhidé, 1999). New evidence also confirms
that common cognitive scripts not only explain similarities in decision-making
among entrepreneurs across cultures but also behavioral differences between
entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs within countries (Mitchell, Smith, Seawright
& Morse, 2000). Recently, longitudinal and cross-sectional research showed that,
in the architectural woodworking industry, CEOs’ traits, skill, and motivation
were significant (direct and indirect) correlates of ventures growth (Baum & Lock,
2002; Baum, Locke & Smith, 2001). Finally, entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs
may react to environmental complexity in contrasting ways. Meyer and Dean
(1990) report that managers replace founding entrepreneurs because the latter
reach the “executive limit”; entrepreneurs fail to adequately reduce environmental
complexity and thereby hinder subsequent venture growth.
These more recent studies hint that older research may have yielded inconclusive findings or identified attributes that could not reliably distinguish
entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs due to inappropriate methodology such
as invalidate measures and inadequate statistical control (e.g. issues of direct
versus indirect effects; cf. Baum & Locke, in press). Many past studies relied on

75

psychometric scales of questionable validity or inappropriate sample populations.
For example, what is the theoretical rationale for comparing entrepreneurs with
managers (Busenitz & Barney, 1997), bankers (Sarasvathy, Simon & Lave,
1999), or students (Chen, Greene & Crick, 1998; Krueger, 1993)? Entrepreneurs
build new businesses regardless of resource availability (Timmons, 1999); they
erect their firms from the ground up, are normally highly vested in their new
venture, and subsequently are liable for their firm’s success or failure. Managers
and bankers, on the other hand, command and control established business
propositions; they are agents not owners, and they are not as exposed to personal
risks as entrepreneurs are. Keeping these contextual variations in mind, it is
easy to understand why research on individual differences that is based on such
samples might provide very inconsistent insights on entrepreneurship.
The challenge of selecting appropriate control groups is related to the daunting
question “who is an entrepreneur and who is not” (Robinson et al., 1991). Thus
an important factor that hinders research in entrepreneurship evolves around procedures for sample selection. First, due to the aura surrounding economic growth
and innovation, many studies implicitly share a common bias of over-selecting
successful entrepreneurs. Second, despite the importance of technological innovation not many studies actually control for subjects’ ability to innovate and hence
it remains unclear whether reported differences are due to group membership
(e.g. entrepreneurs vs. non-entrepreneurs) or ability to innovate. Third, to our
knowledge, few studies relied on homogenous groups of entrepreneurs and even
fewer relied on random sampling techniques. Ignoring that large variations among
entrepreneurs make comparisons within and across studies difficult, much research
used convenient samples of entrepreneurs who work in diverse, frequently even
unrelated, industries. Finally, researchers in entrepreneurship have a tendency
to “handpick” their samples despite the fact that pre-study knowledge of group
membership might have inadvertently introduced additional confounds and biases.
The foregoing review suggests that although the field of entrepreneurship is interdisciplinary with roots in economics, sociology, management, and psychology,
research on individual differences in entrepreneurship has not drawn extensively
upon the findings and methodologies of social and cognitive psychology. This
is somewhat disappointing because a number of key issues that entrepreneurship
research tries to address focus on human cognitions, thoughts, and mental models
(e.g. “Why do some persons but not others become entrepreneurs?” “What is it
that makes some entrepreneurs so much more successful than others?”). Indeed,
an important objective of this chapter is to augment the methodological standards
currently used in research on individual differences in entrepreneurship by relying
not only on constructs and processes borrowed from sister disciplines such as
social and cognitive psychology, but also on their methodologies.

GIDEON D. MARKMAN, ROBERT A. BARON AND DAVID B. BALKIN

For the past several years, Baron and his colleagues (e.g. Baron, 1998, 2000;
Baron & Markman, 2000, in press; Baron, Markman & Hirsa, 2002; Markman,
Balkin & Baron, in press; Markman & Baron, 2002) and others (cf. Baum & Locke,
in press; Baum, Locke & Smith, 2001; Shane, 2000) have sought to augment
methodological rigor and create closer conceptual links between entrepreneurship
and cognitions by identifying well-established psychological constructs that seem
relevant to understanding the characteristics and activities of entrepreneurs. Our
research sought to extend this ongoing work. Building on emergent research on
individual differences and entrepreneurship (including, Busenitz & Barney, 1997;
Chen, Greene & Crick, 1998; Honig, 1998; Stewart et al., 1999, to name a few), we
focus on three dimensions that appear to be particularly relevant for entrepreneurship research. The factors examined here are: (a) regretful thinking (an aspect of
counterfactual thinking), thoughts regarding events and outcomes different from
the ones that actually occurred (Baron, 2000); (b) perseverance – perceived ability
to persist and overcome adversity and challenges;1 and (c) self-efficacy – our belief
in our ability to perform certain tasks successfully (Bandura, 1997).
As explained henceforth, we predict that since setbacks, challenges, snags, and
disappointments characterize the process of new venture formation, persons who
start new companies – as compared with ones who don’t – will recall more regretful
thoughts, but will also perceive higher levels of capacity to persevere and selfefficacy. To reiterate, the goal of this chapter is to address the following question:
Are patent inventors who start new companies (hereinafter called entrepreneurs)
higher in terms of perceived regrets, perseverance, and self-efficacy than inventors
who opt to work as employees for established organizations (hereinafter called
non-entrepreneurs)?

THEORY AND HYPOTHESES
Regretful Thinking: Thinking About Negative Outcomes
Experiencing unintended detrimental consequences or imagining favorable
outcomes that did not materialize is a frequent experience for most people. Such
regretful thinking often occurs in response to information about unfavorable
outcomes and unmet expectations, and frequently leads, in turn, to strong
emotional reactions such as disappointment and blame (Zeelenberg et al., 1998).
For instance, regretful thinking can be observed among Olympic athletes who
win silver medals. Such athletes have been found to be less happy with their
success than are athletes who receive bronze medals (Medvec, Madey & Gilovich,
1995). Research on counterfactual thinking explains this seemingly anomalous

<-----Page 4----->The Role of Regretful Thinking, Perseverance, and Self-Efﬁcacy

77

result in the following manner: Silver medal winners are unhappy because they
imagined winning a gold medal (i.e. they imagined better outcomes than they
actually received), while bronze medallists are happier because they imagined
receiving no medal at all (i.e. worse outcomes than they actually received). Thus,
like counterfactual thinking, regretful thinking is a cognitive representation of
alternative consequences and they are activated automatically, particularly (though
not exclusively) in response to misfortunes and disappointments (Baron, 2000).
Regretful thinking is important because such strong sentiments may have
profound effects on one’s mood, understanding of cause-effect relationships,
decision-making, task performance and even personal health (Roese, 1997). For
instance, thoughts may activate the same analgesic pathways that morphine does;
placebos boost blood flow to brain areas that are packed with opiate receptors.
In management, research shows that regret and blame are particularly vivid in
contexts involving product failure (Creyer & Gurhan, 1997). Our basic prediction
is that entrepreneurs, because they encounter potent market and technological
obstacles, experience substantially more regrets than others who invent yet
participate in a very limited way in the commercialization of their technologies.
Championing a new venture can evoke strong emotions; capitalizing on poor
opportunities (and the subsequent failure) or caving in to competition (and
observing how others reap the rewards) can stir up strong regrets.
At first glance, this prediction would appear to be directly contrary to findings
reported by Baron (2000), who reported that entrepreneurs, as compared to
non-entrepreneurs, experienced fewer life regrets and less intense regret over
missed opportunities. However, there appear to be several reasons why Baron
(2000) found fewer regrets in his group of entrepreneurs while we expect to find
more (and more intense) regrets among entrepreneurs in the present research.
First, Baron (2000) worked with a very different population than the one employed
here. The entrepreneurs his research had all started their own businesses (Gartner,
1988), and so can reasonably be described as entrepreneurs. However, in many
cases, these businesses did not involve ideas for new products or services; rather,
they were largely “new variations on existing themes.” In the present research,
in contrast, we focus on persons who have generated ideas for new products or
services and, moreover, have obtained patents on these inventions. In short, they
are all inventors, and to the extent they use their inventions to start new ventures,
are entrepreneurs in the strongest sense of this term, as defined recently by Shane
and Venkataraman (2000). We reason that people who have discovered an idea for
a product or service feel a strong, personal involvement with this idea: after all,
they have truly created it. For this reason, we suggest, they may be more likely to
experience strong regrets following setbacks. In short, they are so “ego-involved”
with their inventions, that they are more likely to experience regrets when they

<-----Page 5----->78

GIDEON D. MARKMAN, ROBERT A. BARON AND DAVID B. BALKIN

encounter obstacles while developing these ideas. In contrast, people who invent
under the auspice of and for existing organizations may be less “ego-involved”
with them; indeed, they have chosen to turn the inventions over to others. Thus,
they would be expected to experience fewer or weaker regrets than entrepreneurs.
A second reason why we predict different results in the present study than those
obtained by Baron (2000) is as follows: in his research, Baron used a standard
measure of counterfactual thinking – asking participants to list the three things
they regret most in their lives. This kind of open-ended question leaves participants
free to describe regrets over actions they had taken which had turned out badly
(e.g. “I invested in a stock that went straight down.”) and actions they had not
taken but wish they had (e.g. “I wish I had decided to pursue an MBA degree”).
Research suggests that thinking about actions people wish they had taken but did
not, can be especially unpleasant, so it is possible that the participants in Baron’s
research suppressed reports of such events, thus lowering the total number of
regrets reported. In the present research, we restrict our attention to regrets of
decisions – actions taken that turned out poorly. As a result, participants may be
more likely to report regrets than was true in the research by Baron (2000). And
given the reasoning presented above (i.e. people who start new ventures remain
ego-involved with their inventions), we predict that entrepreneurs will report more
and more intense regrets than non-entrepreneurs.
What about the pattern of regrets reported by entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs? If entrepreneurs are indeed more involved with their inventions
than persons who invent for others, we might expect that the regrets they report
will focus more on business decisions and other factors relating to their new
ventures, while non-entrepreneurs will report a wider range of regrets (e.g. over
education, career choices, etc.). This hypothesis too will be investigated. Overall,
our reasoning concerning regretful thinking leads us to the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1. Inventors who build new ventures based on their discoveries
report a higher number of regrets than inventors who invent as employees for
an existing company.
Hypothesis 2. Inventors who build new ventures based on their discoveries
report more intense regrets than inventors who invent as employees for an
existing company.
Hypothesis 3. The regrets of inventors who build new ventures based on their
discoveries focus to a greater extent (than inventors who invent as employees
for an existing company), on business decisions, but to a lesser extent on
other decisions (e.g. ones pertaining to education, career choices, personal
relationships).

Perseverance
Despite repeated assertions – particularly by economic paradigms – that at
the core of entrepreneurship is “opportunities recognition” and “alertness” (cf.
Kirzner, 1997), we maintain that entrepreneurship research must also assess key
activities such as one’s conviction in his or her ability to convert discoveries into
moneymaking services or products. The recognition versus execution debate is
not new and many scholars remain adamant that the opportunity – and particularly
the process of opportunity recognition – remains fundamental to wealth creation
processes (Shane, 2000; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). We fully agree, yet our
interviews of patent inventors, technology transfer executives, patent attorneys,
and entrepreneurs indicate that only small subsets of all discoveries are actually
commercialized. A typical Silicon Valley VC firm, which receives over 5,000
unsolicited business plans a year and invest only in about ten, will earn industry
admiration once even one of those unsolicited business plans becomes a successful
venture. This inverse exponential relationship between discovered opportunities
and tangible ventures hints that recognizing opportunity is perhaps necessary but
clearly insufficient for entrepreneurship to take place. Because the recognition
of opportunity is largely an intangible, cognitive process to be finally validated
when the new venture or product is finally launched, a fundamental question in
entrepreneurship research is not only who can discover opportunities, but also
who can persevere to harvest them (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
Business history is quite familiar with inferior products, services, and technologies that nevertheless outmaneuvered, out-marketed, and outsold superior
counterparts or vice versa, where advanced products and breakthrough technologies that despite their pre-eminence were defeated by inferior counterparts.
The Wintel (Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor) standard
of personal computers became the dominant computing technology despite
the fact that Apple’s MacIntosh technology provided user-friendlier interface.
The technology to record video data on magnetic tape and the subsequent
battle between Betamax and VHS is another example. To use another anecdote,
although science fiction enthusiasts envisioned teleportation – dematerializing
an object at one location, and sending the details of that object’s precise atomic
configuration elsewhere, where it is reconstructed – as a real opportunity, for
years it was thought to violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum
mechanics (Einstein, Podolsky & Rosen, 1935). Now, using a paradoxical feature
of quantum mechanics known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation or
EPR entanglement, it is known that quantum teleportation is possible – at least
with photons (Bennett et al., 1993). The point is that despite the recognition of an
opportunity (i.e. where time and space could be eliminated from travel), complex

<-----Page 7----->80

GIDEON D. MARKMAN, ROBERT A. BARON AND DAVID B. BALKIN

technological barriers, high and long-term risk, and intensive investment capital
required to convert such opportunity into a reality daunt entrepreneurs, investors,
and even nations. Like Thomas Edison, who accumulated 1,093 patents and noted
that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, we point that it is one thing
to discover opportunities, but an entirely different matter to harvest them.
To recap, we concede that opportunity recognition may be a precondition to
entrepreneurial efforts, yet here we stress that it remains unclear who are the
persons who not only recognize novel, useful, and non-obvious technologies, but
also transform these inventions into establish new ventures. Because the actual
pursuit of opportunities is very challenging (McGrath, 1995), we suspect that
at least part of the answer to this question lies in human variability in terms of
perceived capacity to persevere in the face of adversity.
Although the concept of perseverance has been studied for many years,
most research on this topic has focused on how beliefs, thoughts, and attitudes
persist in light of new information and in spite of the discrediting of old “facts.”
More recently, Eisenberger (1992), Eisenberger, Kuhlman and Cotterell (1992),
Eisenberger and Leonard (1980), have extended this line of work to the domain
of task performance and work persistence. For example, Eisenberger (1992)
found that reinforced effort results in persistence that transfers to different tasks:
the phenomenon of learned industriousness (Eisenberger, 1992) occurs when
high effort on one task (e.g. solving complex anagrams) transfers to another
(e.g. detecting differences between cartoon drawings). Eisenberger and Leonard
(1980) found that high effort reduces disruptive responses such as frustration,
blame, and anger produced by early failure, and thus leading to greater subsequent
tenacity and persistence. Like Eisenberger (1992), we define perseverance as
one’s capability to persist and endure in the face of difficulties, risks, and failure.
We propose that because individuals experience varying levels of adversity,
success is determined, to an important degree, by the extent to which individuals
persevere despite what appear to be insurmountable obstacles, or in Stoltz’s terms
(1997, 2000), adversity. A corollary of this is that perceived perseverance may be
crucial – even if insufficient – for one’s success in entrepreneurial settings.
Perceived capacity to persevere influences individuals’ courses of action, the
level of effort they put forth while pursuing their endeavors, the length of their
endurance and the level of their resilience in the face of lasting obstacles and
repeated failures (cf. Eisenberger & Leonard, 1980). Perceived perseverance also
influences how much stress and setbacks individuals experience while they cope
with taxing situations, and the level of accomplishments they realize (Bandura,
1997). For instance, perseverant people find out ways to circumvent constraints or
change them by their actions, whereas less diligent people are easily discouraged by
impediments and unexpected challenges (Bandura, 1997; Eisenberger et al., 1992).

<-----Page 8----->The Role of Regretful Thinking, Perseverance, and Self-Efﬁcacy

81

Launching a new venture requires a high level of conviction in one’s ability to
overcome challenges plus the successfully transformation of the new technologies
into attractive commercial products or services. We propose that people who
discover or invent similar inventions and are exposed to very comparable
obstacles differ in the way they perceive adversity. This proposition begs the
following question: What specific types of perseverance will be most useful to
entrepreneurs? Although the answer to this interesting question depends, to an
important degree, on the various situations entrepreneurs face, a careful review of
available evidence (e.g. Stoltz, 1997, 2000) indicates that two constructs appear
to be particularly relevant. These include, perceived control over adversity and
perceived ownership of the outcome of adversity (regardless of what caused the
adversity in the first place). As detailed below, we predict that technical inventors
who create new ventures perceive higher levels of control over the adversity they
face, and sense greater ownership regarding outcomes of the adversity.

Control: Perceived Control over Adversity
People strive to control events that affect their life circumstances because doing so
provides innumerable personal, financial, and social benefits (Lam & Schaubroeck,
2000). Being able to predict and control events fosters adaptive preparedness,
whereas inability to exert influence over adversity breeds apprehension, apathy,
and at times desperation (Bandura, 1986). Also, because actions are based more
on what is perceived or believed than on what might be objectively true, alleged
control is an important precursor to one’s level of motivation and actions. Specific
perceived control over adversity is a major basis of action because people who
believe they can attain certain outcomes have the incentive to act (Bandura, 1997).
Perceived control over adversity – which is central to most human behaviors and
the focus of this theory – should not be confused with general “locus of control”;
the former refers speciﬁcally to control over adversity whereas the latter is a global
measure of one’s ability to influence one’s own fate or outcomes (Stoltz, 1997).
Perceived control over adversity influences the course of action, the level of effort
put forth, and the length of perseverance and resilience in the face of obstacles,
failures, or hardship. Perceived control over adversity also affects how much stress
individuals experience while they cope with taxing environments, as well as the
level of accomplishments they realize (Stoltz, 2000). In short, perceived control
over adversity influences what individuals do and become and their motivation to
act despite impediments.
Theory and practice agree that when confronting setbacks, perseverant
individuals intensify their effort and experiment with new actions, whereas those

<-----Page 9----->82

GIDEON D. MARKMAN, ROBERT A. BARON AND DAVID B. BALKIN

who are less perseverant quickly give up (Cervone, 1989). We note that the
development and use of new technologies as a basis for new components or
even end products is the outcome of intensive work conducted by determined,
self-disciplined individuals (cf. McGrath, 1995). Indeed, our interviews with
numerous patent inventors (entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs) indicate that
their key challenge is to persevere until they thoroughly troubleshoot vexing
technological obstacles. Since launching a new venture entails a combination of
both technological and business obstacles, it stands to reason that entrepreneurs
would probably have stronger perceived control over their adversity. Stated
differently, launching a business requires strong perceived control over adversity
along both technological and business value chains; entrepreneurs must not
only convert their new technological discovery into working prototypes but also
transform them into viable moneymaking products and services. While we suspect
that all inventors perceive strong control over adversity related to their work, we
expect entrepreneurs to perceive even stronger control over adversity because the
survival and longevity of their young venture depends on their perseverance and
determination to convert their new technology into a business. Hence the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4. Inventors who build new ventures based on their discoveries tend
to have higher perceived capacity to control adversity than inventors who invent
as employees for an existing company.

Accountability: Perceived Ownership of the Outcomes of the Adversity
Accountability, particularly in response to unfavorable events, might manifest
itself as regret, disappointment, and blame (Roese, 1997). Some individuals, for
instance, experience intense discontent when they fail to attain outcomes for
which they have a strong mental image (Medvec, Madey & Gilovich, 1995). Such
strong emotions are important because growing empirical evidence suggests that
emotions have profound effects on perceptions and judgments (e.g. Forgas, 1995),
understanding of cause-effect relationships, decision-making, and thus on task
performance (Mandel & Lehman, 1996). Perceived accountability, despite the
short-term negative affect it generates (e.g. sadness, disappointment, and blame),
is offset by inferential benefits that prove advantageous on a longer-term basis.
For example, when task performance is deemed inferior because of lack of effort
(rather than ability), a causally potent antecedent has been identified; deploying
additional effort will enhance future performance. Substandard execution and
its associated negative affectivity alert us to a particular problem and prompt

<-----Page 10----->The Role of Regretful Thinking, Perseverance, and Self-Efﬁcacy

83

corrective thinking and action (Schwarz, Bless, Srtack & Klumpp, 1991). In
short, once accountability “mobilizes” us to rectify negative outcome (Peeters
& Czapinski, 1990), an adaptive reaction is established. Accountable individuals
focus on actions and outcomes; they take steps to circumvent unpleasant events or
center their attention on the outcomes of adversity regardless of its origin (Stoltz,
1997). Because entrepreneurship entails highly turbulent environments in which
the process of transforming technological opportunities into innovative products
or services rarely goes undisturbed, human variability in preference and reaction
to setbacks and disappointments may be quite telling. The question, then, is
whether entrepreneurs, in the presence of adversity and setbacks, perceive stronger
accountability over adversity (regardless of its origin) than do non-entrepreneurs?
Two rationales, both emanating from the interaction between persons’ preferences and situations (Markman & Baron, 2002), suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. First, there is no strong reason to suspect that inventors differ on
how hard they work on their discoveries. However, because it is public knowledge
that launching a new venture requires resolve to overcome setbacks – including
those impediments generated by others – persons with weak sense of ownership
regarding adversity might shirk from becoming entrepreneurs. Conversely, individuals who take leadership over adversity are more likely to excel in entrepreneurial
settings. Naturally, accountability to harsh circumstances and setbacks could
intensify subsequent to becoming entrepreneurs and as such diminished ownership
over adversity among entrepreneurs might increase business vulnerability. Agency
theory confirms that owners are more committed to and accountable for producing
commercial outcomes than their agents (Deckop, Mangel & Cirka, 1999). This
suggests that accountability and business ownership are causally interrelated:
highly accountable persons are likely to pursue entrepreneurial undertakings and
those who are owners of their ventures likely to become more accountable.
Second, studies report that lack of ownership, as captured by various excuses
and rationalizations, is a self-protecting reaction aiming to reduce personal responsibility for taxing events (Schlenker, 1997; Schlenker et al., 2001). The goal is to
sway others (self-included) that failure did not stem from one’s action as it might
otherwise appear to be; and when self-fault is undeniable, that the “incident” is
merely due to transient blemish rather than permanent attribute (e.g. carelessness
rather than stupidity). Avoiding accountability minimizes negative repercussions,
including reducing negative affect (e.g. guilt, shame, remorse), damage to reputation, and punishment for failures. Although failure is rarely intentional, individuals
vary greatly in the way they see failure, and thus the prospect of failure guides
many decisions (Schlenker et al., 2001). As entrepreneurial undertakings are
notoriously difficult and the large majority of young businesses fail (Hamel, 2000;
The State of Small Business: A Report to the President, 1995), it stands to

<-----Page 11----->84

GIDEON D. MARKMAN, ROBERT A. BARON AND DAVID B. BALKIN

reason that attitudes towards failure influence one’s likelihood of championing
a new venture.
Research confirms that lack of accountability and the assignment of blame are
particularly vivid in contexts involving failure (Taylor, 1995) and that responsibility diffuses in proportion to group size (Forsyth, Zyzniewski & Giammanco, 2002).
Keeping this in mind, it is apparent that work span and responsibility horizons of
non-entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs are also unequal. Entrepreneurs are in charge
of their business; its growth and the markets to be pursued, its competitiveness, and
of course, failure. Entrepreneurship is an occupation in transition; entrepreneurs
work with more diverse and interdependent stakeholders and they are accountable
for deliverables that are outside their immediate function and control. The
cross-functional nature of their work diverges from the traditional work and compartmentalized activities that are common in domains in which non-entrepreneurs
work. The prospect of all-embracing vocation span and the open-ended responsibilities (for good, but also bad) suggest that persons seeking entrepreneurial
careers probably hold themselves responsible and accountable for adversity they
face. On the other hand, persons shirking from taking ownership over predicaments
that are not their doings are rather unlikely to seek entrepreneurial undertaking.
Thus, the interaction between persons’ preferences and contexts (cf. Markman &
Baron, 2002), agency theory and the obvious implications of failure suggest that
persons opting to become entrepreneurs will perceive stronger ownership over
outcome of adversity than their counterparts. This reasoning is summarized by the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5. Inventors who build new ventures based on their discoveries
tend to have higher perceived ownership of the outcome of adversity that they
encounter than inventors who invent as employees for an existing company.
Although studies on individual differences recognize some unavoidable overlaps
between perseverance and self-efficacy, evidence from theoretical and applied
studies on human variability suggests that these constructs have unique features
that merit their conceptual distinctness (Bandura, 1995, 1997; Nir & Neumann,
1995). Hence, to further theoretical development we conclude this theory
section with additional discussion regarding self-efficacy. Testing for the unique
effect of self-efficacy, rather than self-esteem or locus of control, is important
because research has shown that the former is a robust predictor of superior
task performance (cf. Bandura, 1997), and human variability in entrepreneurship
(Baum et al., 2001, 2002; Chen, Greene & Crick, 1998). We reasoned that testing
for the unique effect of perseverance, over and above self-efficacy, would provide
discriminate validity between perseverance and self-efficacy.

Self-Efﬁcacy: Beliefs in our Ability to Effectively Accomplish Certain Tasks
To briefly reiterate, self-efficacy involves the belief that we can organize and
effectively execute actions to produce given attainments (cf. Bandura, 1997;
Chen, Greene & Crick, 1998; Gist & Mitchell, 1992; Krueger & Brazeal, 1994).
Self-efficacy impacts our perceived control, how much stress, self-blame, and
depression we experience while we cope with taxing circumstances, and the level
of accomplishments we realize. It also influences our courses of action, level
of effort, our reaction to failure, and whether our thoughts are self-hindering or
self-aiding (Bandura, 1999; Wood & Bandura, 1989). Vasil (1992) found that
when the effects of experience, academic rank, and disciplinary affiliation are
controlled, scholars high in self-efficacy excel. While many occupations call
for high self-efficacy (Gist & Mitchell, 1992), performing innovative research
resulting in patents is a good example since it is constrained by time, funding,
and uncertain outcomes despite relentless intellectual effort. Moreover inventions
are scrutinized, challenged, and frequently refuted before (and sometimes after)
they attain patent status. Since the process of scientific discovery is strewn with
technological obstacles, successful patenting rests heavily on strong self-belief
(Bandura, 1999; Gist & Mitchell, 1992; Wood & Bandura, 1989). In short,
self-efficacy is central to most human functioning, and since actions are based
more on what people believe than on what is objectively true, thoughts are a
potent precursor to one’s level of motivation, affective states, and actions.
If self-efficacy impacts career undertaking, performance, and success would
it also predict, or at the very least be related to, entrepreneurial pursuits? We
think that it would because of three main reasons. First, people avoid careers and
environments they believe exceed their capabilities (regardless of the benefits
these may hold), but they readily undertake vocations they judge themselves
capable of handling (Krueger & Dickson, 1994), and the higher their self-efficacy,
the more challenging the activities they pursue. Second, because entrepreneurs
operate at the crux of change, innovation, and market perturbation, they personally
realize higher financial, technological, and legal liabilities and uncertainties. On
the other hand, inventors “working-for-others” continue to operate in relative
seclusion and predictability; they are less exposed to market resistance, competitors’ retaliation, or suppliers’ protest. Past research indicates that under taxing
circumstances individuals with higher self-efficacy perform more adeptly (cf.
Bandura, 1997). Finally, although some research has suggested that self-efficacy
successfully differentiates entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs (Chen, Greene
& Crick, 1998), as we noted earlier, such inferences stem from studies with
students, managers, and occasionally with handpicked samples of entrepreneurs.
We suggest that starting a new venture – obtaining external funding, recruiting

<-----Page 13----->86

key partners and employees, and overcoming what appear to be insurmountable
business and technological obstacles – is substantially different than managing
an existing operation or undergoing classroom simulations. Since self-efficacy
reliably predicts the scope of career options considered, occupational interests,
and personal effectiveness, we suggest that it will also be related to the pursuit of
entrepreneurial activity. Thus our last hypothesis is as follows:
Hypothesis 6. Inventors who build new ventures based on their discoveries
have higher self-efficacy than inventors who invent as employees for an existing
company.

METHODS
We decided to focus on a sample of patent inventors because patents are a reasonable proxy for technological innovation, a precursor to newly developed product
components, and an indication of technological capital (Balkin, Markman &
Gomez-Mejia, 2000). Patents may also erect legal and technical barriers to rivals.
For example, our interviews of patent inventors, technology transfer executives,
and patent attorneys suggested that good patents may provide footholds to new
technologies and therefore are an important source of competitive advantage.
Finally, patents are an indication of inventive capacity that benefits society
(Trajtenberg, 1990).
To reduce selection biases commonly found in entrepreneurship research (see
Markman, Balkin & Baron, in press, for a detailed discussion on this issue), while
obtaining evidence on the hypotheses, we extracted a random sample from a list of
4,861 patent inventors, obtained from the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office. All
4,861 inventors were granted patents for their inventions during 1997 and 1998
for inventions encompassing surgery devices (patent classes 600, 601, 602, 604,
606, 607). Since the original list of 4,861 inventors included only minimal contact
information (i.e. first and last name, city, and state), we used Visual Basic to scan
the Nation Wide Phone Directory (NWPD) software that resides on CD ROMs
and to retrieve complete contact information (e.g. full address and phone number)
for each inventor.
The Visual Basic output yielded 3,491 non-duplicated entries. Then, using
Excel Spreadsheet and the “randomize” command function, we selected a random
sample of 586 patent inventors. Then, in early 1999, all 586 patent inventors were
contacted via telephone, were invited to participate in our study, and were sent a
survey. Two weeks later we called all the non-respondents and then sent our second
batch of survey mailing. We repeated the same procedure two to six additional

<-----Page 14----->The Role of Regretful Thinking, Perseverance, and Self-Efﬁcacy

87

times with all non-responding inventors. Although we sent surveys to a random
sample of 568 patent inventors and received 233 surveys back (41% response
rate), only 217 were usable. Hence, in contrast to many studies in entrepreneurship
that compared samples of known entrepreneurs with a sample of predetermined
non-entrepreneurs, we relied on a random sample of inventors, all of whom invent
in the same technological space, at the same time period, and we did not know
ahead of time, which inventors were entrepreneurs and which were not.
Placed at the last section of the mail survey, a qualifying question asked
inventors to indicate whether they used their invention to start their own business
in 1997 or 1998. Such a qualifying question used successfully in previous
studies including the Entrepreneurship Research Consortium (ERC project;
Carter, Gartner & Reynolds, 1996). Of the 217 qualified inventors, 55 (25%)
used their invention to start a new company and therefore were classified as
entrepreneurs (coded as 1), whereas the remaining 162 (75%) did not, and thus
were classified as non-entrepreneurs (coded as 0). This relatively high rate of
entrepreneurship (25%) may be attributable to the monopolistic nature of patents.
Unlike traditional businesses, start-ups anchored in patents enjoy substantial
technological protection, competitive insulation, some legitimacy, and a relatively
wider window of opportunity (Rivette & Kline, 2000).
Before outlining the study’s procedures and operations, it is worthwhile to reemphasize four things that distinguish this study from others. First, classification of
participants, in this case, patent inventors as entrepreneurs or as non-entrepreneurs,
was made only after the surveys were collected and data were coded. Second, restricting the assessments of entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs to inventors who
invent in the same technological space at roughly the same time period (1997–1998)
provides a stronger test of hypotheses outlined above. Third, although the source
of the primary data collection was based on self-reported surveys, we also verified
data consistency through phone interviews and crosschecks with the U.S. Patent
and Trademarks Office website (e.g. patent count). Fourth, we made an attempt to
account for non-response bias. To this end, we compared our random sample with
46 inventors who refused to return their surveys back on age, formal education,
annual income, and number of patents developed. Data from non-responding
inventors – obtained via phone calls – and analysis showed no significant differences between the two samples. Finally, because of potential covariation between
opportunities and individuals, Shane (2000) advocates that studies on individual
differences control for the characteristics of the opportunity. To alleviate this
predicament we took three remedial steps: First, using a random sample of inventors implies that the characteristics of the opportunities may also be randomly
distributed between the two groups. Second, our AQ measures were not tied to the
opportunity, but instead were based on the same hypothetical scenarios described

<-----Page 15----->88

henceforth (Table 1). And finally, inventors in this study invented highly related
patents (surgery devices), which to some extent represents a set of opportunities
with similar characteristics.

Procedures and Operational Measures
Inventors were asked to complete a short questionnaire consisting of several
scales adapted from widely used measures of regretful thinking (Baron, 2000),
perseverance (Stoltz, 1997, 2000), and self-efficacy (Maurer & Pierce, 1998).
Unlike previous research that treated regretful thinking as a unidimensional or
homogenous construct, we assessed three aspects of regretful thinking, including
a quantitative, qualitative, and magnitude measure of inventors’ regrets. The
quantitative and qualitative measures were based on inventors’ responses to an
open-ended question: “think about your life and career and list the decisions that
you regret most.” This question generated two different dimensions of regretful
thinking. First, we counted the quantitative measure of regrets by adding up
the decisions that inventors regretted most. Second, a content analysis of the
same decisions by two independent raters had identified six types of regrets (e.g.
business opportunities, career, education, investment and finance, personal value,
and relationships). Interrater consistency was high; in 92% of the cases they were
in complete agreement. This was the measure of the qualitative nature of regrets.
Finally, on the next page of our survey, participants were also asked to indicate, on
a seven-point scale, how much regret they had experienced regarding the decisions
they had just listed (1 = little regret; 7 = much regret). This was the measure of the
magnitude of regrets. The instruments to measure regretful thinking are depicted in
the Appendix.
The measure of perseverance consisted of a 40-item scale that was developed
and validated by Stoltz (1997, 2000) with more than 100,000 participants from
diverse organizations in a variety of industries. Each item consisted of a statement
representing hypothetical events (e.g. “you apply for a job change and don’t get
it”; “you fail to meet the deadline on a major project”) followed by two questions,
each representing the dimensions described earlier (i.e. control and ownership).
The respondents’ task was to indicate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which the
statements represented them (see Appendix). Factor analysis showed that the two
constructs, composed of eight items each, were reliable (e.g. control: ␣ = 0.77
and ownership: ␣ = 0.81). Following Stoltz’s recommendation (1997, 2000) we
also created one additional variable – a composite of both scores of perseverance.
Despite the fact that self-efficacy measures have generally relied on scales relating to specific tasks, some research calls for broader measures, particularly

when the vocations under consideration have little in common or require a very
diverse set of skills (cf. Bandura, 1997). Since starting ventures requires human
capabilities in many and different domains and validated self-efficacy scales for
patent inventors are not yet available, we used a general scale. Therefore, perceived
self-efficacy in this study was measured in terms of the belief about what one can do
under different conditions with whatever skills one possesses (Chen, Gully & Eden,
2001; Eden & Aviram, 1993). This measure was an eight-item, seven-point scale
(1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree) that was used successfully in previous
research (Maurer & Pierce, 1998). Items in this scale included such statements as
“I am strong enough to overcome life’s struggles,” “I can handle the situations that
life brings,” and “I usually feel I can handle the typical problems that come up in
life” (␣ = 0.89). All eight measures of self-efficacy are depicted in the Appendix.
Consistent with previous research on individual differences in entrepreneurship,
the survey obtained additional control variables such as age, education (measured
by years of formal education), and personal annual income for 1998. Since all the
inventors in our study worked on novel, non-obvious, and useful technologies, an
additional control variable that our study brings to this line of research is a measure
of one’s inventive capacity as captured by the number of patents granted to each
inventor (Griliches, 1990; Romer, 1996).

Analyses
A MANOVA examined the relationship between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs (as the fixed factor) on a set of five dependent variables: magnitude of
regrets; number of regrets; control over adversity; ownership regarding outcomes
of adversity; and self-efficacy, where age, years of education, innovation (i.e.
number of patents), and income included as covariates. Content analyses and
discriminant analysis examined the relationship between entrepreneurs and
non-entrepreneurs on all qualitative data regarding inventors’ regretful decisions.

RESULTS
Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and correlations for all the inventors,
regardless of group membership. As shown in Table 1, the average inventor in this
study was 47 years old, had more than 19 years of formal education, and at the
time of the survey had been granted over 13 patents. In 1998, the average inventor
earned approximately $118,000 a year. Entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs were
closely matched on education, age, income, and innovations, and the inventors

91

who also became entrepreneurs started their firms with two cofounders and raised,
on average, $6 million to build their company.
The results of the MANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs on the sets of dependent variables
(Pillai’s trace = 0.05, F = 3.80, p < 0.02). The size of the multivariate effect of
entrepreneurship on the five dependent variables, as indexed by partial eta squared,
was 0.09. Univariate ANOVAs confirmed that entrepreneurship had significantly
stronger regrets (F = 6.01, p < 0.05), but the two groups did not differ on the number of regrets (F = 1.44, p = ns). Univariate ANOVAs also revealed that group
membership (i.e. entrepreneurs vs. non-entrepreneurs) was significantly related
to perceived control over adversity (F = 8.03; p < 0.005) and perceived ownership regarding outcomes of adversity (F = 4.07; p < 0.05). Specifically, means
perceived control over adversity and perceived ownership regarding outcomes of
adversity were significantly higher for entrepreneurs than for non-entrepreneurs.
Finally, and consistent with predictions made elsewhere, but with different samples (Chen, Greene & Crick, 1998), we too find that entrepreneurs tend to have
significantly higher self-efficacy (F = 5.27; p < 0.02).
As described earlier, a content analysis of the qualitative measure of regretful
thinking identified six types of regretful decisions, including business opportunities, decisions regarding career, education, investments, personal values,
and personal relationships. A discriminant analysis suggested that entrepreneurs
regret more decisions regarding business opportunities whereas non-entrepreneurs
list more regrets about education and career decisions (Chi-square = 30.84;
p = 0.01). The discriminant function accounted for 78% of the between group
variability. Thus, findings reported in Tables 2 and 3 provide support for all
hypotheses except for Hypothesis 1; the difference in entrepreneurs’ and nonentrepreneurs’ regret count was not significant. That is, Hypothesis 1 was not

supported because although, on average, entrepreneurs reported a slightly a higher
number of regretful decisions than non-entrepreneurs did, the difference was not
statistically significant. On the other hand, since the two groups differed on the
magnitude of their regrets, Hypothesis 2 was supported; entrepreneurs reported
significantly stronger regrets than non-entrepreneurs did. Additionally, and as
predicted by Hypothesis 3, entrepreneurs reported primarily regrets concerning
business opportunities whereas non-entrepreneurs reported mainly regrets about
their career and education. Entrepreneurs, as compared with non-entrepreneurs,
also tend to have significantly higher perceived control over adversity and a greater
sense of ownership regarding the outcome of adversity regardless of the origin of
adversity. Hence, Hypotheses 4 and 5 were supported. Finally, since entrepreneurs
reported significantly higher self-efficacy, Hypothesis 6 was supported too.
To recap, the data offered support for Hypotheses 2–6, but Hypothesis 1 was
not supported. Table 2 shows the adjusted means for the five dependent variables
broken-down for entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. The discriminant function
of the structure matrix and the test of group means for the qualitative data are
reported in Table 3.

DISCUSSION
As we stated at the beginning of this chapter, much research in entrepreneurship is
using tighter theoretical views and better empirical testing to address the question
of individual differences (e.g. Baron, 1998, 2000; Baron & Markman, 2000, in
press; Baron, Markman & Hirsa, in press; Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Chen, Greene
& Crick, 1998; Krueger, 1993; Markman, Balkin & Baron, in press; Markman &
Baron, 2002). We tried to extend this ongoing work by assessing the relationship
between regretful thinking (Baron, 2000), perceived capacity to persevere (Stoltz,
1997, 2000), and self-efficacy on the one hand, and new venture formation on the

<-----Page 20----->The Role of Regretful Thinking, Perseverance, and Self-Efﬁcacy

93

other. Findings confirmed that those inventors who start new ventures tend to have
specific regrets (i.e. relating to business opportunities), have significantly stronger
regrets, higher perceived control over the adversity and perceived ownership of
the outcome of adversity that they face, and finally, stronger self-efficacy.
Unlike previous research that shows that entrepreneurs – as compared to others – engage in limited counterfactual thinking (cf. Baron, 2000), we found that
entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs report almost identical numbers of regretful
decisions. Our research found that not only do entrepreneurs experience stronger
regrets; they also experience regrets over different kinds of decisions than their
counterparts (i.e. business opportunities vs. career and education decisions). We
attribute these findings, which diverge from the ones reported by Baron (2000), to
our unique and random sample of patent inventors and our qualitative measures of
regrets, which were different from the ones employed by Baron, and focused on
regrets over decisions rather than over life events of missed opportunities. As noted
earlier, the different populations employed and the contrasting measures gathered
from participants were expected to generate contrasting patterns of results.
While the finding that entrepreneurs regret mostly decisions about business
opportunity has high face validity (e.g. pursuing opportunities is at the core of
many entrepreneurial activities), a key question is why did non-entrepreneurs, but
not entrepreneurs, regret career and education decisions? Though this question
should be fully addressed by further research, we offer the following explanation.
Job autonomy, particularly in inventive capacity, dramatically influences how
incumbents perceive their work and experience career-related regrets. Unlike
entrepreneurs, non-entrepreneurs work and invent for their employers, and as
such they may encounter stronger barriers to career mobility, limited discretionary
power, and of course, restricted autonomy. A career plateau – the point at which
advancement is improbable – can occur to many astute inventors despite years of
experience. Good engineers have strong problem-solving skills in their respective
technical domains; however, to become executives or managers they need new
skills in management, decision making, business acumen, working well with a diverse workforce, as well as foresight and perseverance. Thus, one’s early decision
to become a skilled scientist or engineer may limit the subsequent likelihood of
being groomed for leadership roles and succession to the top management team
(Daily, Certo & Dalton, 1999). As are a result, non-entrepreneurs in our sample
may have many bases for experiencing regrets over their past decisions. While
this explanation is quite plausible, this proposition is beyond the scope of our
study and thus awaiting further empirical testing.
Research in social, cognitive, and applied psychology shows that self-efficacy reliably predicts personal effectiveness under diverse tasks and careers (cf. Bandura,
1997), and new studies confirm that entrepreneurs tend to be higher in self-

<-----Page 21----->94

efficacy than other persons (Chen, Greene & Crick, 1998). We tried to extend such
results to patent inventors and our findings confirm that inventors who start new
ventures have significantly higher self-efficacy. Perhaps even more interesting was
our finding that after controlling for self-efficacy, inventors’ perceived capacity to
persevere continues to distinguish between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs.
Again, results show that, over and above self-efficacy, perceived perseverance
is related to new venture formation; each of the three constructs – self-efficacy
(␩2 = 0.03); control over adversity (␩2 = 0.05); and ownership of outcome of
adversity (␩2 = 0.03) – accounted for unique variance that was not captured by
the other constructs.
Since past research suggests that perceived capacity to persevere predicts
personal effectiveness under diverse tasks and careers (cf. Bandura, 1997;
Eisenberger, 1992), we were curious whether perseverance explains some
variability in inventors’ annual earnings – a crude proxy of personal success.
To this end, we performed a simple stepwise hierarchical regression, in which
we regressed annual income first on all the control variables (age, education,
innovation), and then on self-efficacy and finally on perseverance as captured by
an aggregate measure of perceived control over adversity and ownership of the
outcome of adversity. This post hoc analysis showed that highly perseverant patent
inventors earn significantly more than patent inventors whose perseverance was
very low (adjusted R 2 = 12%; F = 4.40; p < 0.01). To give a concrete example,
the annual earnings of patent inventors who’s average perseverance score was
in the top 20% was approximately $128,692 vs. $93,933, which was the annual
earnings of inventors whose perseverance score was in the bottom 20% – almost
$35,000 per year difference. Thus, higher perseverance scores – as measured
across all patent inventors – were related to higher personal income. Naturally our
ad hoc analysis provides a simple initial assessment of the link between perceived
perseverance and personal success. Such link should be the subject of future
empirical research, which includes wage determination variables.

Implications, Limitations, and Future Research
This study has important implications for research, theory, and practice. It provides
guidance for future research on individual differences in the context of new product
development and innovation, and it makes contributions to our understanding of
individual differences in the context of entrepreneurship. For example, it shows that
even among persons who discover novel, useful, and non-obvious technologies,
those who ultimately undertake the daunting task of creating new ventures appear
to have higher perseverance and higher self-efficacy. However, and despite very

<-----Page 22----->The Role of Regretful Thinking, Perseverance, and Self-Efﬁcacy

95

favorable coverage by the popular press, it appears that the entrepreneurial journey
yields particular, and at times stronger, regrets.
Despite the fact that regretful thinking is an important cognition in decisionmaking, until recently very little research has focused on this topic in the context of
entrepreneurship (cf. Baron, 2000 as an exception). For example, researchers have
noted that decision makers anticipate and take into account the possibility that
their decisions may produce regretful thoughts (e.g. Loomes & Sugden, 1986).
As such, future research on entrepreneurs’ regretful thinking could be helpful
in understanding how these thought processes and cognitions affect decision
and actions. For instance, regretful thinking, which is primarily associated with
the presence of negative outcomes, together with people’s natural tendency to
avoid disappointment, could explain why some people, but not others, reject the
possibility of starting a new venture. Others showed that people are generally
risk-averse and that this tendency is stronger under conditions of possible gains
than possible loss (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982). To extrapolate from the work
of van Dijk et al. (1999), one reason for this tendency could be that opting not
to start a new business might limit disappointments and regretful thinking. In
other words, increased anticipation of disappointment and regrets might motivate
risk-aversive career paths. Playing it “safe” allows us to expect less, obtain what
we expect more easily, and therefore avoid the perils of becoming chagrined with
disappointments and regretful thinking. Clearly, regrets are interesting cognitions
that await further investigation in the context of new venture formation.
The study’s focus on perseverance and the evidence that people are not victims
of their adversities strike a hopeful note. That is, unlike relatively stable personality
and trait characteristics, perceptions of adversity are somewhat open to modification. As perseverance enables human action, at least to some extent people are the
architects of their own destinies (Bandura, 1986). Assuming all else equal, one’s
reaction to adversity is – with the appropriate education and training – improvable
(Stoltz, 1997; Waldroop & Butler, 2000). For example, developing perceived
control and accountability is accelerated when individuals alter the reasons they
assign for their successes and failures. When people change their explanations for
why important and impactful outcomes occurred, they improve their expectations
for positive outcomes in the future (Mifflin & Schulman, 1986; Seligman, Reivich,
Jaycox & Gillham, 1995). Seligman and his colleagues (1995) suggest that providing individuals with such tools and skills can help them transform helplessness
into mastery that bolsters self-efficacy and perseverance. Teaching individuals to
challenge their thoughts and assumptions can “immunize” them against adverse
impact of setbacks (Eisenberger, 1992). Improving one’s perseverance reduces
the risk of helplessness as it boosts performance, improves physical health, and
increases self-reliance in the face of new challenges (Stoltz, 1997).

<-----Page 23----->96

GIDEON D. MARKMAN, ROBERT A. BARON AND DAVID B. BALKIN

At another level, evidence also suggests that a “can-do” attitude rubs off; that being around dynamic individuals who keep adversity in perspective is infectious (cf.
Smith & Muenchen, 1995). This suggests that entrepreneurs can use their pattern
of thinking (e.g. “can-do”) to inspire and motivate their partners and others who
work with them. Finally, since perceived perseverance is significantly associated
with personal success, we may want to – assuming all else equal – give strong considerations to tenacious entrepreneurs and agents. A corollary of the fact that perseverance is both augmentable and functional is that it may be worthwhile to assess
this construct among future entrepreneurs. For example, investors such as venture
capitalists may improve their odds if they consider technical inventors’ perceived
perseverance. Similarly, in the context of corporate entrepreneurship, managers
may assess intrepreneurs’ levels of perseverance to identify early career track of
technical people to become champions of new business units. Of course, these
suggestions are tentative and awaiting further empirical testing and validation.
Before concluding, several limitations to this study must be addressed. First,
although dividing patent inventors into entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs
simplifies the methodology, it is an oversimplification. In reality, particularly over
time, inventors may “migrate” from working for others to working for themselves
and vice versa. Some inventors may be building their own start-up – which may or
may not be tied to their patent – while holding employment elsewhere. Also, the
survey did not collect data on the organizations in which participants work, and it
is possible that some inventors who were classified as non-entrepreneurs actually
work for start-up firms. In other words, the division of participants into two
dichotomous groups may fail to capture a richness that ranges between what we
categorically termed entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. While the use of two
dichotomous groups proved quite revealing, assessment of more than two groups
was beyond the scope of our study and thus awaiting further empirical testing.
A second limitation stems from the reliance on patent count as a proxy of
innovation. Researchers note that the distribution of patent quality is highly skewed
toward the low end with a long, thin tail into the high-value end (Trajtenberg,
1990). Our interviews with technical inventors, chief technology officers (CTOs),
intellectual property attorneys, and technology transfer directors reveal that fewer
than 10% of patents are commercialized. This is not surprising because many
patents have no market value until they are combined with several other patents
(e.g. Gillette’s Mach 3 is protected with over 30 patents!). Additionally, some
inventors may file for patents for intellectual reasons, others to passively “protect”
technology share, and yet others use patents to strategically position their invention
in a particular technological space. Also, patents may allow inventors to cajole
rivals into alliances, partnerships, and concessions that are not of the rivals’ initial
liking. In short, as patent count is an imprecise proxy of innovation, we suggest

<-----Page 24----->The Role of Regretful Thinking, Perseverance, and Self-Efﬁcacy

97

that future empirical research try to distinguish between high- and low-quality
innovations.
As we hinted earlier, future empirical studies should also attempt to measure and
control for additional factors relating to individual differences (e.g. locus of control,
need for achievement, level of motivation, self-esteem, and so on), contextual
factors (e.g. work environment) and various outcomes variables (e.g. starting a
new business, performance, success, etc.). Unfortunately, a key challenge to field
researchers is the unavoidable tradeoff between casting a broad empirical net and
response rate. Highly inclusive survey instruments with a myriad of psychometric
scales are also lengthy and time-consuming, and while such surveys may work
in classroom settings, they are prohibitively difficult to justify to inventors and
scientists or to persuade them to respond.
One final weakness of our study, which is mainly due to its cross-sectional
design, relates to uncertainty regarding causality. Since data were collected after
inventors began building their new ventures, it is unclear whether founding a new
firm increases one’s regrets, perceived control and ownership of adversity, and
self-efficacy, or whether scoring high on these dimensions leads one to found a
new venture. Two points – and a rich research stream on the causal efficacy of
human thought (cf. Bandura, 1995) – suggest that at least perseverance and selfefficacy are more likely to precede the act of new venture formation than to be the
result of it. First, it is important to recall that we relied on a general, rather than
specific, measure of self-efficacy. Since general self-efficacy is the result of lifelong
experiences; is quite stable by the time individuals are adults (Bandura, 1997); and
since we obtained data from entrepreneurs shortly after they had launched their
new ventures, such short-term business activity, in and of itself, probably did not
elevate one’s self-efficacy in any meaningful way. Second, success and failure in
diverse activities and over prolonged periods of time shape one’s perceived control
over adversity and ownership over outcomes of adversity (Stoltz, 1997, 2000). As
explained above, since our entrepreneurs launched their new ventures only a few
months before we surveyed them, it is unlikely that these relatively short-term
activities had already altered inventors’ perseverance levels in such a significant
magnitudes. Clearly, only longitudinal methods or experimental research design
will fully address this question, but in the meantime, and for the reason outlined
above, we suspect that differences in perseverance and self-efficacy may contribute
to the decision to become an entrepreneur rather than the opposite.
Notwithstanding these limitations, it is important to recognize the recent resurgence of interest in individual differences in the field of entrepreneurship (Baron,
1998, 2000; Baum et al., 2001; Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Chen et al., 1998; Ensley
et al., 1999; Honig, 1998; Sarasvathy et al., 1999; Stewart et al., 1999, to name
a few). In this context, this study adds some value as it was based on a random

<-----Page 25----->98

sample of inventors, all of whom had invented patents in the same technological
space, at the same time period (1997 and 1998), and we – the researchers – did not
know ahead of time which inventors were entrepreneurs and which were not. Collecting income information is another dimension that separates this study from its
predecessors. Our findings suggest that perceived capacity to persevere in the face
of daunting and formidable obstacles may be related to personal success such as
annual earnings. For example, highly perseverant patent inventors enjoyed almost
$35,000 more in annual earnings than less perseverant inventors. Furthermore,
since perceived perseverance explains additional variance that was not captured
by self-efficacy, our study expends our knowledge of individual differences; it
introduces new constructs that we believe merit further empirical testing.
In closing, we found that entrepreneurs, as compared with non-entrepreneurs,
report particular and stronger regrets, significantly higher levels of perceived control and accountability over adversity, and higher levels of self-efficacy. We also
found that, among our inventors, perseverance is related to personal success as
measured by annual earnings. To the extent that perceived perseverance is vital in
life, we suspect that Confucius was right when he suggested that our greatest glory
is not in never failing, but in rising every time we fail.

NOTE
1. Some entrepreneurship research addressed the issue of persistence and tenacity (cf.
Baum & colleagues, 2001, 2002; McGrath, 1995) and others have used persistence as an
outcome. However, such research neither measured the underlying psychological factors
that make one persist nor made distinctions between types of perseverance.
