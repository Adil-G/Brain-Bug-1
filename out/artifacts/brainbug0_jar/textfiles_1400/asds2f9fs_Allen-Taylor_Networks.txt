ABSTRACT
Two schools of thought dominate network theory. Cohesion theorists propose that densely embedded
networks are more beneficial because they are closed. Structural hole theorists counter that networks are
open social structures where advantages derive from brokerage opportunities. Addressing these two
perspectives empirically, we employ a mathematical framework for the study of complex networks to
analyze the innovation network captured by a database of applications for funding made to the Tech Coast
Angels, a Southern California network. We find that this network is far sparser than those suggested by
either of the two schools of thought in network theory.
INTRODUCTION
Networks are a critical factor in a successful new venture launch. They serve as information conduits;
they provide access to resources; and they offer legitimacy to overcome the liabilities of newness and
smallness. Consequently, new venture success depends in large part on the entrepreneur’s ability to
construct a network of supportive relationships (Dubini and Aldrich, 1991; Grabner, 1993). In particular,
social networks are the primary way that entrepreneurs tap the angel investor market because angels are
particularly difficult to identify and reach. It has been suggested that entrepreneurs overcome the
liabilities of newness and smallness by participating in large, robust networks that are also diverse.
Research also suggests that people who locate near holes in the social structure of networks have a higher
propensity to innovate and create new value. It is argued that opinion and behavior tend to be more
homogenous within groups than between groups; therefore, people who are connected across groups have
greater opportunities to experience diverse ways of thinking and behavior and, as a result, gain access to
more opportunities for innovation. The social structure of networks is characterized by clusters of dense
connection linked by occasional bridges between clusters (structural holes). It is also described by the
strength of direct and indirect ties between and among the network members. When these dimensions are
applied to entrepreneurial ventures, the question becomes is the liability of newness that affects emerging
ventures likely to be overcome if the ties are more direct, rather than indirect, heterogeneous in nature
rather than homogenous, and sizeable in number rather than limited.
In this study, we look at the nature and effectiveness of an entrepreneurial network developed by the Tech
Coast Angels (TCA), a west-coast based private equity group that provides funding and mentoring to
entrepreneurial ventures in the early stages of development. In particular, we examine and describe the
affiliation networks of new ventures and the entrepreneurs who, over a four-year period, submitted
proposals for funding to the TCA to determine their compatibility with network theory.

Network and Structural Hole Theories
Two schools of thought dominate network theory and argue for their distinct advantages: cohesion or
cluster theorists and structural hole or brokerage theorists. Cohesion theorists propose that densely
embedded networks with many connections are more beneficial because they are closed (Walker, Kogut,
& Shan, 1997). Dense networks of direct ties appear to foster the development of shared norms, routines,
and the trust necessary for the sharing of proprietary information (Uzzi, 1997). They also help to curb

<-----Page 1----->opportunism that might damage relationships. However, it is also argued that strong ties add little value
when one is seeking resources because everyone within the network has access to the same resources
(Granovetter, 1985). If everyone has access to the same resources, then no competitive advantage can be
derived. One stream of research proposes that a venture with many direct ties (an embedded network)
may actually profit less from potential information that it receives from indirect ties than it would in a
more open network that is less dense; that is, it may experience a form of information inertia that comes
from depending primarily on its trust network of direct ties (Zaheer & Zaheer 1997).
Structural hole theorists, by contrast, posit that networks are open social structures where advantages
derive from brokerage opportunities across structural holes that create valuable social capital (Burt 1992).
Therefore, organizations with management and collaborative networks that bridge structural holes in their
markets tend to learn faster and are more creative, increasing the probability for invention and innovation
to occur. More recently, research has suggested that large networks of indirect ties and many structural
holes is a way for members to benefit from network size without incurring the cost of network
maintenance as would be the case with direct ties (Burt, 1992). Indirect ties, then, produce greater
efficiency and they also allow for diversity. These weak ties bring network members in contact with
others less well known, which increases the resource pool.
For organizations to become powerful within a collaborative network, they must be critical to the network
structure and functioning. In the literature, this has been called a firm’s degree of centrality, that is, the
number of organizations to which a firm is tied (Freeman, 1979). Betweenness centrality is also a measure
of a firm’s power. If firm A is connected to firm B, and B is connected to C, but A and C are not
connected, then B has power because the other two firms can only connect through B. Yet another
measure of centrality is how close a firm is to the rest of the network so that it does not need to go
through many firms to get where it needs to go.
Geography has also played a role in the structure of networks. A number of sociological studies about the
likelihood of friendship and marriage have determined, for example, that the probability of a relationship
occurring increases with physical proximity because of the increased probability of a random interaction.
Conversely, the likelihood that a relationship is formed declines with distance (Blau, 1977). The structure
of a network influences which members recognize opportunities because relationships tend to cluster in
both geographic and social space (Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). In social space the equivalent factor to
geography is sociodemographic attributes (Milgram, 1967) or homophily, the degree to which the
participants are alike. In the case of angel investors, those that have dense networks that are geographical
localized and homophilous are better able to assess the value of an opportunity and monitor that
opportunity once an investment has been made.
Social Capital Theory
Social capital has been viewed as the “contextual complement” to human capital. That is to say that
people who perform at higher levels tend to be better connected (Burt, 2000). Social capital consists of
trust, norms, and networks—the features of a social organization. It is also described by contagion,
prominence, closure, and brokerage. Contagion is the mechanism that ensures the proliferation of beliefs
and practices more effectively between people and organizations. Prominence is the advantage people
have from their association with the network. Closure and brokerage affect the way information flows
through the network and what people are able to do with that information. A dense network has closure,
that is, everyone is connected with everyone else. This affects access to information and facilitates
sanctions that reduce the risk of dealing with others in the network (Coleman, 1990). Closure is more
related to status quo, while brokerage is more about change and bridging the gap between cohesive
groups. Burt and others contend that as more entrepreneurs bridge the gaps between groups, the value of

<-----Page 2----->the structural hole decreases until some level of equilibrium is achieved where the advantage disappears
(Burt, 2000). The social capital associated with structural holes is a short-run advantage leading
eventually to equilibrium. The only networks that maintain the advantage of structural holes over the long
term are those in which the culture of the network does not change or where information becomes
obsolete very quickly.
Over the past 20 years, organizational theorists have increasingly focused on the effect of intra and
interfirm social relations in the belief that a firm’s strategies are affected by their location in
interorganizational networks (Mizruchi and Stearns, 2002). The seminal work of Granovetter (1985)
postulated that economic behavior was embedded in social networks such that financial decisions like
expanding or downsizing, buying or selling are influenced by the network of people to which the decision
maker is connected. Granovetter proposed that whether the decision-maker acted opportunistically or
cooperatively was dependent on the number of non-instrumental relationships the decision-maker had.
Sociological research in the 1950s proposed that proximity in distance and time enhances the probably of
a random connection (Blau, 1977). However differences exist between network members in terms of
their position in the network. Research has found that the probability that a venture capitalist will invest in
a target venture is reduced sharply as distance to the target increases (Mizruchi & Stearns, 2002). This is
consistent with human ecology theory, which states that the probability of interaction between social
elements is a multiplicative function of the distance between them (Hawley, 1971). This is explained in
large part by the costs associated with interacting at a distance. Despite incentives to consider
opportunities outside their local network, VCs tend to only consider localized opportunities (Gupta &
Sapienza, 1992).
Network Performance
A rich and varied stream of research supports the idea of increased performance or social capital as
related to brokerage across structural holes. Economic transaction data show how producer profit
margins increase in networks of suppliers and customers where structural holes exist (Burt, 1982). Lab
experiments have demonstrated how resources tend to accumulate in brokers that have exclusive
relationships with partners that are not generally connected (Markovsky, Willer, and Patton, 1988).
Furthermore, research has described the competitive advantages of networks abundant in structural holes
(Granovetter, 1985). Brokerage creates value through four different acts: 1) creating awareness for the
interests and needs in groups; 2) sharing best practices; 3) recognizing differences in groups; and 4)
recognizing opportunity from bringing together two different groups. Firms with collaboration networks
that bridge structural holes typically learn faster and are more creative (Sutton and Hargadon, 1996).
Venture capital firms that cross structural holes by linking investors that are normally not linked tend to
make more early-stage investments that give them a competitive advantage and more often result in an
IPO (Podolny, 2000). Although there is a paucity of data to support the ubiquitous belief that
entrepreneurs are natural brokers of structural holes, it is a commonly accepted fact in the literature that
entrepreneurs develop networks and link disconnected people and entities to find the human capital,
financial capital, and social resources required to successfully launch a new venture (Aldrich, 1999).
Physical Models of Complex Networks
The discussions above are phrased in terms of qualitative properties of networks; however, the underlying
structures of complex networks can be quantified. We believe that the framework discussed in this
section, which is based on the physical sciences literature, may be a fruitful way to structure the debate
outlined above. The underlying idea is that complex web-like structures or networks are a fundamental
way to describe much of what occurs in both the physical and non-physical worlds. From human cellular

<-----Page 3----->structure to the network of Web pages that form the World Wide Web, these complex systems have
become the subject of much scientific research, particularly in the physics community, which has
developed a powerful set of tools for predicting the behavior of whole systems based on the nature of
their parts (Albert and Barabasi, 2002). Successful modeling efforts to study complex networks are the
result of the simplicity of interactions between and among the constituents. It is easy to see what or who
is interacting with what, and to determine the strength of the interaction by the physical distance between
the members.
From the efforts of scientists to quantify the basic organizational principles of networks came three
models. First, complex networks have traditionally been studied as random graphs, the simplest and most
direct insight into complex networks. The seminal work of Erdos and Renyi (1960) is still the basis for
modeling and empirical studies in many areas. The question that scientists struggle to answer is, are these
networks that form the basis of complex systems, such as the Internet, fundamentally random? It would
seem that networks must display some basic organizational principles and, if so, it would be important to
quantify them. That question led to the development of two additional models: small worlds and scalefree models.
The work of social psychologist Stanley Milgram (1967) revealed the concept of “six degrees of
separation,” a model that recognizes that the distance between two nodes in a network is relatively short.
Distance is defined as the “number of edges (links) along the shortest path connecting them (Albert and
Barabasi, 2002). In the U.S. for example, studies have revealed that the distance between acquaintances
is commonly six people (Kochen, 1989). Sociological research has further identified clustering as a
common element of social networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and from the concept of clustering has
emerged a second class of models known as small-world models. For instance, the World Wide Web is
the largest network for which topological data are available. Despite its 800 million nodes, it displays
surprisingly small-world features (Albert, Jeong, & Barabasi, 1999). At the domain level, research
determined that the clustering coefficient for the World Wide Web ranged from 0.18 to 0.3, which can be
compared to a clustering effect of 0.001 in random networks. The average path length was between 3.70
and 3.77, which again illustrates its small-world properties (Yook et al. 2001). Although the concept of
small worlds is interesting, it does not succeed in revealing a specific organizing principle for networks
because research has demonstrated that the distance between any two nodes in a random graph increases
as the logarithm of the number of nodes, so one could argue that random graphs are also small worlds.
With the availability of datasets capturing the structure of large collaboration networks, as well as other
large networks such as the World Wide Web and the internet, a third class of models that are scale-free
have emerged, suggesting “a universal theory of network evolution” (Albert and Barabasi, 2002). A scalefree structure can be identified by examining the probability distribution, P(N), for the connectivity
(number of links) for a node. When this distribution has the form of a power law, P(N)∝N-β, the network
has a fractal structure such that it looks the same when examined at any scale. Examples of this structure
in scientific collaboration networks have been presented in Newman (2001).
Investigations of the robustness of the Internet have also led to the understanding that networks can
undergo drastic changes in their overall connectivity as a result of relatively small changes in the
distribution P(N) (Cohen, et al., 2000). In particular, small reductions in the mean connectivity of nodes
relative to the variance of the connectivity of nodes can cause a network to change from being essentially
completely connected to being completely fragmented. This transition is known as a “percolation”
transition, a term arising from studies of the connectivity of pores in rocks, relevant to the question of
whether or not oil trapped in the rock can be pumped out.

<-----Page 4----->As the total size of the network shrinks, the mean connectivity needed to have a network that is largely
connected increases. Cohesion theorists would postulate that effective innovation networks would exist
well above the percolation transition, while structural hole theorists would suggest that they would lie
near the transition. Guided by these suggestions, a goal of this paper was to identify where the innovation
network defined by the TCA database actually lies relative to the percolation transition.
METHODS
Description of the Database
The data for the study came from a proprietary database owned by the Tech Coast Angels, a Los Angelesbased private equity network that invests in early-stage technology and life science companies in
Southern California. TCA members provide seed and early-stage capital in the range of $250K-$2M.
Since 1997, TCA members have invested over $55 million in more than 85 Southern California
companies, together with $591 million from venture capital co-investors. Potential applicants for TCA
funding are advised that they should have a “potential for high growth, a strong market position, and a
sustainable advantage.” In particular, TCA members are looking for opportunities that will generate at
least $50 to $100 million in annual revenues. TCA members do not ordinarily consider investments in
companies based outside of Southern California. Applicants seeking access to the funding process

The database used for the present study contains all applications for funding made to the TCA between
December 7, 2000 and November 26, 2004. A total of 2,247 companies initiated the TCA application
process. After elimination of incomplete applications, 1,809 applications remained that included
information about the company directors (a surrogate for founders and key personnel). Each application is
identified by a unique number and includes entries summarizing the date submitted, market niche,
competitive advantages, product and services, industry, location, stage of development, funding status as
of November. 26, 2004, level of interest by TCA members, number of employees, relationship to TCA (if
any), IP, capitalization, financing, comparables, competition, and the list of “directors.”
Analysis Chain
For each company, the list of directors was extracted and used to prepare a list with one director entry for
each company with which that director was associated. A unique identifier was then assigned to each
distinct name providing a two-mode affiliation network of people and companies. The program Pajek
(De Nooy, Mrvar and Batagelj, 2005) was then used to create two one-mode affiliation networks. In the
first, each node represents a company in the database. Links between the companies are then defined by
individuals that are directors of each company. In the second one-mode network, the nodes consist of
individual directors. Links between individual directors are defined by companies in which both
individuals are directors. Pajek was also used to create 2-D illustrations of the actual networks. The
frequency distribution of the number of links in each one-mode network (that is, the frequency
distribution of the degree of centrality) was then tabulated.
RESULTS
The actual rate at which applicants are funded is quite low. A total of 42 of 1,809 applicants received
TCA funding. An additional 8 applicants received VC funding with no TCA participation, and 2
companies were acquired. The disposition of all applications for funding as of November 26, 2004 is
presented in Table 1.

<-----Page 5----->The two-mode affiliation network consisted of 7,461 distinct individuals and 1,809 proposed new
ventures. There were a total of 8,240 edges, or links, defined by associations between individuals and
companies. The one-mode network of companies is illustrated in Fig 1. Links between companies are
defined as individuals are directors of both companies. The figure is constructed using Pajek in such a
way that companies that do not share any director with any other company will appear on the oval
boundary. There are a total of 1,809 vertices (companies) in this network, with a total of 558 links
between them.
Fig 2 illustrates the collaboration network among individuals. Each node is a distinct individual
appearing one or more times as a director of a company applying for TCA funding. Links between
individuals are defined as companies on which both serve as directors. The figure is constructed using
Pajek in such a way that only individuals linked to other individuals serving in the same company will
appear on the oval boundary. There are a total of 7,461 nodes (distinct individual directors) with a total
of 17,505 links between them.
The first thing that is quite evident from both diagrams is the remarkably sparse nature of the networks.
(Note that the networks appear to be denser than they actually are. Because the display is only 2dimensional, disjoint sub-networks may be displayed on top of one another and appear to be connected.)
The TCA network is clearly far below the percolation transition and far sparser than the networks
contemplated by either the cohesion theorists or the structural hole theorists. This is perhaps best
illustrated by Table 2, which presents the frequency distribution for the number of links between
companies. Fully 61% of the companies have no directors serving as a director of any other company,
and thus have no links to any other company. Overall, much of the distribution is well described by a
power law as might be expected from previous studies of collaboration networks (Newman 2001).
Table 3 presents the corresponding frequency distribution for the number of links between individuals.
There are several interesting features of this distribution. First, 116 people, representing 1.6% of the
individuals in the database, are the only people associated with their proposal for TCA funding, and are
thus completely isolated from any network. This represents 6.4% of the total proposals to the TCA for
funding. Second, the peak at N=6 appears to be an artifact of the TCA application process. The database
has space allocated for up to 7 directors, and fully 25.2% of the applicants do in fact identify 7
“directors.” Some 36.6% of all individuals in the database are associated with these companies.
One interesting question, of course, is whether a “connected” company is more likely to receive TCA
funding than one which is completely isolated. We found that 22 of the 42 companies that received TCA
funding (or slightly more than 50%) were linked to at least one other company, while only 39% of the
companies in the full data set were linked to one or more companies. If there were no relationship
between being connected and being funded, then one would expect the same fraction in both data sets.
The fact that more than 50% of the funded companies were connected suggests that connectivity confers
some advantage.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
It is clear from the literature that the success of new technology ventures is enhanced when they are
embedded in a social network that is densely populated. These types of networks are important because
the trust, information sharing, tacit knowledge, collaboration, and action they facilitate enable the
allocation of resources more efficiently and produce higher levels of performance. In the current study,
we looked at the network of companies that had applied for screening to the Tech Coast Angels group as
well as the network of directors of those companies. In both cases, the networks were sparse; that is,
there were few linkages. This was a surprising but interesting finding as one would intuitively think that

<-----Page 6----->within Southern California, potential directors/entrepreneurs might be more connected. The reality of this
region, however, is that geographic proximity, critical to high performing networks, is not the deterring
factor to dense network formation. Temporal distance due to traffic is more likely the culprit.
Consequently the structural holes between network members in the TCA network are significant and
consist of both physical and temporal distance. Further research will be required to determine the impact
of these factors on the performance of the network. It also would appear that the TCA network is diverse
and non-redundant and therefore, as Burt (2002) predicted, faced with the challenge of developing weak
distant relationships into more robust connections to avoid isolation. But the empirical evidence on
brokerage also supports the claim that individuals who can span those distances have the competitive
advantage of early information and innovative ideas. In future research we intend to explore these
relationships.
One limitation of the database was that the number of directors (key personnel) reported was limited to 7,
so it may be that some of the companies had more than 7 key personnel that might have been linked with
other companies in the database. More likely is the probability that database participants entered the most
important personnel up to 7. Another limitation of the database is that it is only four years old. Networks
often take time to develop and over time, we might see more connections as the TCA continues to record
its applicants and their transactions.
Implications
The current study was designed to look at the nature of the network of entrepreneurial companies
represented in the database through mathematical modeling techniques. It has barely tapped the surface
of the critical questions that could be addressed by the data. Planned research includes addressing the
issues of firm performance relative to position in the network, the effect of firm size and positioning on
performance, and the effect of individuals serving in key roles in more than company, to name a few
topics.
The TCA database is a rich resource of private data, and the research that derives from this data will
provide new information about angel networks and the way they work. For angel networks, this and
future research will suggest ways to improve the connectivity and performance outcomes of the network
through bridging the structural holes that appear to be dominant in this particular network. This is
important because information sharing, trust, cooperation and action all occur within a social context and
that context is a critical factor in the economic development of a region.
This study is a first look at a network that has never previously been studied. The structure captured by
the TCA database is significantly sparser than the networks envisioned by the theory in the literature. For
efficient brokerage to occur, a network would need to be located near the percolation transition where
small changes can have dramatic effects on the structure of the network. One of the implications of this
study is that it points to the need for a theory of new venture creation and innovation in sparse networks.
In addition, these results suggests the need for further research that compares the characteristics and
performance results of this network to other networks including a presumably more densely embedded
network such as that found in Silicon Valley. These results will have important policy and practice
implications for understanding why some regions produce superior performance and others languish.
