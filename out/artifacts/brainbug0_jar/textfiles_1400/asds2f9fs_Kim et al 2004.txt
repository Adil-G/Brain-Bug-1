Two studies were conducted to examine the implications of an apology versus a denial for repairing trust
after an alleged violation. Results reveal that trust was repaired more successfully when mistrusted parties
(a) apologized for violations concerning matters of competence but denied culpability for violations
concerning matters of integrity, and (b) had apologized for violations when there was subsequent
evidence of guilt but had denied culpability for violations when there was subsequent evidence of
innocence. Supplementary analyses also revealed that the interactive effects of violation type and
violation response on participants’ trusting intentions were mediated by their trusting beliefs. Combined,
these findings provide needed insight and supporting evidence concerning how trust might be repaired
in the aftermath of a violation.

management negligence and malfeasance is chipping away at the
trust vital to a free-market system” (Byrne, 2002, p. 31).
The apparent frequency with which trust has been broken suggests that managers may often need to repair it. However, there are
a variety of reasons why the process of repairing trust may be more
difficult, requiring different strategies, than building trust initially.
One of the challenges of repairing trust is that the magnitude of the
required increase in trust may actually be greater than in initial
trust development. In the initial stages of a relationship, individuals exhibit surprisingly high levels of trust because they operate
on the assumption that trust is warranted as long as there is no
evidence to the contrary (McKnight, Cummings, & Chervany,
1998). This provides an elevated platform for moving to even
higher levels of trust based on experience. However, a trust violation invalidates the “trustworthy until proven otherwise” assumption, causing trust to plunge to a level that may be below the
initial trust level. A second challenge of repairing trust is that
mistrusted parties must not only reestablish positive expectations
but also overcome negative expectations. Third, information about
the violation may remain particularly salient, reinforcing the low
trust level despite efforts by the mistrusted party to demonstrate
trustworthiness (Slovic, 1993). In sum, the trust repair process may
differ qualitatively and quantitatively from initial trust development. Hence, different theoretical and empirical approaches may
be needed to understand how it occurs.
Despite the importance of addressing such issues, surprisingly
few studies have directly examined how trust might be repaired. A
handful of researchers has considered the ways in which mistrusted parties might repair trust by offering some verbal response
to these trust violations. Yet, even across this small number of
studies (as well as related research on social accounts, impression
management, and the reestablishment of cooperation in social
dilemmas), there seems to be little consensus regarding what kind
of response this should be. The difficulty of choosing the appropriate response for repairing trust is even further complicated by

Over the past decades, researchers have produced considerable
evidence that trust can offer numerous benefits for individuals and
organizations. The presence of trust has been found, for example,
to facilitate cooperation between interdependent actors, improve
job attitudes, increase organizational commitment and performance, and enable the emergence of new organizational forms (see
Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Kramer, 1999, for meta-analytic and narrative reviews). Through such studies, researchers have largely emphasized the positive qualities of trust and the constructive processes through which trust develops.
Yet, in many cases, an individual’s positive expectations may be
violated, resulting in reduced trust and a need to repair trust. Tyler
and Kramer (1996) noted that, as a result of widely publicized
organizational practices such as the high compensation of CEOs,
organizations have experienced declining trustworthiness in the
eyes of their employees and members of other organizations.
Consistent with this assertion, Robinson and Rousseau (1994)
discovered that 55% of their respondents reported that their employer had violated a psychological contract and that this violation
significantly reduced trust. Indeed, the popular press has noted that
“a seemingly endless stream of bad news alleging widespread

the fact that mistrusted parties may often (a) need to address
actions that they did not commit, and (b) repair trust with people
whom these violations did not directly harm.
These considerations raise some natural questions. Are some
types of responses more effective for repairing trust than others, or
are there contingencies that affect whether one type of response
might be preferred? Moreover, given that trust may be determined
by multiple dimensions, are some responses more effective for
repairing certain aspects of trust than others, and under what
conditions might this be the case? Given the crucial role trust plays
in organizational life, it is essential that scholars and practitioners
alike acquire substantive answers to such questions. The purpose
of this article is to begin addressing these issues by investigating
the relative benefits of two of the most common responses to a
trust violation, apology and denial, for trust repair. In the present
study, we focus on cases in which parties have had limited prior
interaction and/or the relationship is in the emergent stages (as
opposed to a relationship with a long history). We focus on such
cases because of the importance of these early interactions for
defining the nature and quality of the future relationship.

Trust Formation, Violation, and Repair
Consistent with past research, we define trust as a psychological
state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based on
positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another
(Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). Following McKnight
et al. (1998), we refer to the two elements of this definition as
trusting intentions (i.e., a willingness to make oneself vulnerable to
another in the presence of risk) and trusting beliefs (e.g., the beliefs
about another’s integrity or competence that may lead to trusting
intentions). Thus, we recognize that trust is a fairly complex,
multifaceted construct, and we presume that trust repair efforts will
usually need to focus on trusting beliefs as well as trusting intentions. In accordance, we define trust repair efforts as activities
directed at making a trustor’s trusting beliefs and trusting intentions more positive after a violation is perceived to have occurred.
Although trust is generally thought to develop gradually over
time (e.g., Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2000), recent observations suggest
that individuals can exhibit surprisingly high levels of trust for
others even without a history of interaction (McKnight et al., 1998;
Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996). McKnight et al. (1998) noted
that this high initial trust can arise for a variety of reasons,
including an individual’s disposition to trust (i.e., personality),
belief that impersonal structures such as regulations and laws
support one’s likelihood of success in a given situation (i.e.,
institution-based trust), and rapid, cognitive cues arising from
group membership, reputations, and stereotypes. These researchers
also noted, however, that such trust can be fragile due to the
tentative and assumption-based nature of these antecedents.
Parties may often behave in ways that can violate trust, such as
by intentionally exploiting dependencies or by neglecting to fulfill
expectations. However, research suggests that trust can be damaged even when they have not committed such infractions. Empirical studies have found that people can be quite willing to
believe unsubstantiated allegations of such acts, despite the difficulties of determining whether such allegations are accurate (e.g.,
Bell & Loftus, 1989; Penrod & Cutler, 1995; Ross, Ceci, Dunning,
& Toglia, 1994). Moreover, when this occurs, it appears that the

105

onus is frequently placed on the accused party to remove the
shadow of suspicion (Hendry, Shaffer, & Peacock, 1989).
The present studies, therefore, assume that perceivers exhibit at
least some initial trust in parties with whom they have had no
history of interaction and that unproven allegations of untrustworthy behavior would create suspicion sufficient to violate this trust.
In other words, these studies rely on the intuitive and scientifically
justified notion that allegations of untrustworthy behavior would
cause perceivers’ trust in the accused party to be lower than what
it would have otherwise been. We first conducted a pilot study to
validate this assumption. Our two main studies then assess perceivers’ beliefs in an accused party’s trustworthiness (i.e., trusting
beliefs) and intentions to be vulnerable to the accused party’s
actions (i.e., trusting intentions) after that party has responded to
the accusation, to determine the extent to which trust has been
repaired.

Responding to a Trust Violation
Efforts to understand how to repair trust have led trust researchers to focus on two different ways of responding to a trust violation—apology and denial. Apology is defined as a statement that
acknowledges both responsibility and regret for a trust violation.
Denial, in contrast, is defined as a statement whereby an allegation
is explicitly declared to be untrue (i.e., the statement acknowledges
no responsibility and hence no regret). A growing body of literature that assesses the implications of such responses suggests that
each may exert an important influence on trust. However, these
studies have reached seemingly conflicting conclusions about
which of the two responses may repair trust more effectively than
the other.
Some discussions suggest that trust may be repaired more successfully if mistrusted parties identify, acknowledge, and assume
some ownership for the trust-destroying events that occurred
(Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). Although apologizing acknowledges
guilt, which alone should lower trust, its concomitant expression of
regret signals an intention to avoid similar violations in the future,
which should reduce perceivers’ concerns about continued vulnerability and, thereby, improve trust. Thus, on a theoretical level, we
can observe that the effectiveness of apology as a response to a
trust violation depends on the notion that this response’s benefits
(due to potential redemption) would outweigh its costs (due to the
confirmation of guilt).
This reasoning is supported by a wide array of empirical evidence. Findings indicate that victims of psychological harm generally have more favorable impressions of the perpetrator, experience more positive affect, and are more likely to refrain from
severe aggression toward the perpetrator when the culprit apologizes for the wrongdoing than when the culprit does not (Ohbuchi,
Kameda, & Agarie, 1989). Experimental studies of impression
management reveal that the expression of remorse following a
transgression can mitigate punishment (e.g., Schwartz, Kane, Joseph, & Tedeschi, 1978). Moreover, research on social dilemmas
demonstrates that, at least in short-term interactions, apology can
be more effective for re-establishing cooperation after an opportunistic act than denial (Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, & Murnighan,
2002). These findings suggest that individuals will exhibit more
trusting beliefs in and trusting intentions toward an accused party
if that party apologizes, rather than denies culpability, for a trust
violation.

<-----Page 2----->106

KIM, FERRIN, COOPER, AND DIRKS

However, other research observes that an apology may fail to
ameliorate the negative consequences of an accusation because it
involves an acknowledgement of guilt (Schlenker, 1980). According to this view, such guilt would damage trust to a much greater
degree than any benefits apology would garner with regard to
signaling that the violation would be avoided in the future. Denial
may, therefore, represent a more effective response to a trust
violation than apology because it may lead individuals to give the
accused party the benefit of the doubt. The disadvantage of denial
is that it indicates that there is no need to rectify one’s behavior,
which may in turn raise concerns about the mistrusted party’s
future actions to the extent that there are any lingering questions
about that party’s culpability. Nevertheless, denial may still represent an effective response to the trust violation to the extent that
this response’s benefits (due to potential disconfirmation of guilt)
outweigh its costs (due to the lower likelihood of redemption).
This notion is supported by Sigal, Hsu, Foodim, and Betman
(1988), who asked participants to watch a videotape of a simulated
debate in which one political candidate was accused of sexual or
financial misconduct by the other. Sigal et al. found that the
accused party received more votes and was considered to be more
honest, ethical, and trustworthy when that party denied culpability,
rather than apologized, for the misconduct. Moreover, research on
social accounts indicates that denials can help blunt future conflict
and reduce negative reactions to harmful acts. For example, Riordan, Marlin, and Kellogg (1983) used fabricated reports of a
fictitious senator having taken a bribe and found that subsequent
character evaluations of the senator were less negative when the
senator denied, rather than admitted, responsibility for the transgression. Thus, with regard to the relative benefits of apology
versus denial for repairing trust, we can identify both theoretical
and empirical reasons to justify a competing expectation—that
individuals will exhibit more trusting beliefs in and trusting intentions toward an accused party if that party denies culpability, rather
than apologizes, for a trust violation.

Implications of Violation Type
One approach to addressing this apparent contradiction would
be simply to determine which conclusion is valid and which is not.
Yet it may also be possible to reconcile this contradiction. Indeed,
one factor that may play a key role in determining whether apology
or denial is more effective is whether the trust violation concerns
matters of competence or integrity. These dimensions are particularly relevant for our research because they represent two of the
most important qualities for determining trustworthiness (Barber,
1983; Butler & Cantrell, 1984; J. Cook & Wall, 1980; Mayer,
Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Schindler & Thomas, 1993). Expectations of “technically competent role performance” and expectations of “the persistence and fulfillment of the natural and moral
social orders” have been considered to “involve some of the
fundamental meanings of trust” (Barber, 1983, p. 9), and this
notion has been supported by ample empirical evidence (e.g.,
Butler & Cantrell, 1984; Schindler & Thomas, 1993). Moreover,
research has shown that these dimensions offer important bases on
which individuals evaluate a variety of targets, including leaders
(Pancer, Brown, & Barr, 1999), job candidates (T. Cook & Elmer,
1999), and potential collaborators (Kee & Knox, 1970).
Competence-based trust is defined as the trustor’s perception that
the trustee possesses the technical and interpersonal skills required

for a job (Butler & Cantrell, 1984). Integrity-based trust is defined
as the trustor’s perception that the trustee adheres to a set of
principles that the trustor finds acceptable (Mayer et al., 1995).
Research on how individuals resolve discrepancies in their
interpersonal perceptions reveals that there may be some inherent
differences in the way people assess positive versus negative
information about competence versus integrity (see Snyder &
Stukas, 1999, for a review). In particular, these studies suggest that
although individuals tend to weigh positive information about
competence more heavily than negative information about competence, they tend to weigh negative information about integrity
more heavily than positive information about integrity (Madon,
Jussim, & Eccles, 1997; Martijn, Spears, Van der Plight, & Jakobs,
1992). Reeder and Brewer (1979), furthermore, explained such
asymmetries through a schematic model of dispositional attribution, which suggests that attributions of competence and integrity
are influenced by hierarchically restrictive schemas.
Hierarchically restrictive schemas assume that being at one end
of a continuum for a given attribute will restrict one’s behavior,
whereas being at the other end of that continuum will not. People
intuitively believe, for example, that those with high competence
are capable of exhibiting performance at many levels, depending
on their motivation and task demands, whereas those with low
competence can only perform at levels that are commensurate with
or lower than their level of competence. For this reason, a single
successful performance is considered to offer a reliable signal of
competence, given the belief that those who are incompetent
would not have been able to achieve that performance level.
However, a single poor performance is typically discounted as a
signal of incompetence, given that those who are competent or
incompetent can each perform poorly in certain situations (e.g.,
when there is inadequate motivation or opportunity to perform
well).
Similarly, people intuitively believe that those with high integrity will refrain from dishonest behaviors in any situation, whereas
those with low integrity may exhibit either dishonest or honest
behaviors depending on their incentives and opportunities. For this
reason, a single honest behavior is typically discounted as a signal
of honesty, given that those who are honest or dishonest can each
behave honestly in certain situations (e.g., when there are benefits
for behaving honestly or sufficient surveillance to prevent dishonest acts). However, a single dishonest behavior is considered to
offer a reliable signal of low integrity, given the belief that only
persons of low integrity will perform in dishonest ways.
Thus, hitting a home run once makes us home run hitters in the
eyes of others even if we strike out afterward. In contrast, embezzling from a company once makes us an embezzler even if we do
not engage in additional thefts in the next few days, months, or
even years. These differences in the way people assess positive
versus negative information about competence and integrity have
been used in negotiation research to explain why negotiators are
more likely to behave in ways that confirm certain kinds of
feedback than others (Kim, Diekmann, & Tenbrunsel, 2003).
However, the implications of these studies may be extended even
further to shed light on the ways in which interpersonal perceptions, specifically the perception of untrustworthiness, may be
disconfirmed.
In particular, the notion that people weigh positive information
about competence more heavily than negative information about
competence suggests that it may be more effective to apologize

<-----Page 3----->REMOVING THE SHADOW OF SUSPICION

rather than deny culpability for a competence-based trust violation.
Although an apology confirms that the violation was committed,
this information will not be considered to be particularly diagnostic of one’s inherent competence because the incident may be
considered an anomaly that would not necessarily be repeated in
the future. The negative effect on trust from an apology’s admission of guilt should, therefore, be less significant than its positive
effect on trust from signaling the intent to prevent further violations because people may be willing to believe that the mistrusted
party will demonstrate that he or she possesses positive competence in the future. Denial, in contrast, will limit perceived guilt,
but also limit signals of intended redemption because this response
indicates that there will be no effort to change one’s behavior.
Thus, given that the benefits of reducing nondiagnostic negative
competence information (i.e., perceived guilt) are outweighed by
the costs of reducing expectations of highly diagnostic positive
competence information (i.e., perceived redemption), an apology
should ultimately be more effective than denial for repairing trust
after an alleged competence-based trust violation.
In contrast, the notion that people weigh negative information
about integrity more heavily than positive information about integrity suggests that apologizing for integrity-based trust violations
will not be as effective as denying culpability. Apologizing for
such violations would again confirm guilt, but in this case, such
guilt would be perceived to offer a reliable signal that one lacks
integrity (i.e., because people believe that a lack of integrity is only
exhibited by those who do not possess it). Moreover, given that
individuals tend to discount positive information about integrity
(i.e., integrity cannot be proven), the belief that one lacks integrity,
once established, will be difficult to disconfirm (e.g., Reeder &
Coovert, 1986). Denial, in contrast, would again limit perceived
guilt and signals of intended redemption. However, given that the
benefits of reducing highly diagnostic negative integrity information (i.e., perceived guilt) will outweigh the costs of reducing
expectations of nondiagnostic positive integrity information (i.e.,
perceived redemption), denial should ultimately be more effective
than apology for repairing trust after an alleged integrity-based
trust violation.
Hypothesis 1a: When trust violations concern matters of
competence, individuals will exhibit more positive trusting
beliefs in the accused party if that party responds with an
apology rather than a denial. When trust violations concern
matters of integrity, individuals will exhibit more positive
trusting beliefs in the accused party if that party responds with
a denial rather than an apology.
Hypothesis 1b: When trust violations concern matters of
competence, individuals will exhibit more positive trusting
intentions toward the accused party if that party responds with
an apology rather than a denial. When trust violations concern
matters of integrity, individuals will exhibit more positive
trusting intentions toward the accused party if that party
responds with a denial rather than an apology.

Study 1
The purpose of Study 1 was to examine the implications of
different types of responses (apology or denial) for increasing trust
from preexisting low levels, as would exist after an alleged trans-

107

gression. Thus, we designed a laboratory experiment in which
participants watched a videotape of a job applicant at an accounting firm, who had been accused of incorrectly filing a tax return in
her last job, and then rated the applicant’s trustworthiness after she
explained what had occurred. Following guidance provided by
Dobbins, Lane, and Steiner (1988), we chose this experimental
method and laboratory setting so that we could draw clear conclusions about causality.

Method
This study implemented a 2 (violation-type: competence vs. integrity) ⫻
2 (violation-response: apology vs. denial) between-subjects design. Participants were randomly assigned to the four study conditions. Each participant represented a unit of analysis.

Participants
Sixty-three undergraduate students enrolled in introductory organizational behavior and human resources management courses participated in
this study for course credit, and 137 graduate business students from four
negotiation courses participated in this study as part of an in-class exercise.
Thus, the total sample size was 200. Participants in the undergraduate
sample were 61% male, an average of 22 years old, and possessed an
average of 1 year full-time work experience. Participants in the graduate
sample were 56% male, an average of 26 years old, and possessed an
average of 3.5 years full-time work experience. We included undergraduate
and graduate students in the study to enhance the generalizability of the
results (because of increased breadth of work experience and demographic
diversity in the sample) and statistical power.

Task
Participants were given materials that asked them to assume the role of
a manager who was in charge of hiring, and subsequently managing, a
senior-level tax accountant. If hired, the candidate would be offered a
1-year contract because it was the policy of the firm to employ all senior
tax accountants under 1-year contracts with renewal contingent on annual
performance evaluations. Participants were told that, to expedite the hiring
process, a recruiter from the firm had already interviewed the applicants
and that these interviews had been videotaped and transcribed so participants could quickly and conveniently assess the applicant pool. Participants
were then given the transcript for one of these interviews and shown the
accompanying video clip so they could provide their own evaluation of the
applicant. After watching the interview, participants completed a
questionnaire.

Manipulations
Four versions of this interview were filmed with a video crew and actors
in accordance with our 2 ⫻ 2 experimental design. The bulk of each
version contained identical video footage; only the segments containing the
two manipulations differed across study conditions. During the course of
the interview, the recruiter disclosed to the job applicant that she had
contacted some of the applicant’s references from the previous employer
and that these references informed the recruiter that the applicant had been
involved with an accounting-related violation in her previous job. The
framing of, and response to, this trust violation represented the study
manipulations.
Violation type. The trust violation was framed as either a competenceor integrity-related matter. The alleged violation was described so that it
was consistent with the conceptual definitions of competence and integrity
presented earlier in the article. In both conditions, the job applicant was
accused of filing an incorrect tax return that understated a client’s capital
gains income. In the competence condition, the job applicant was accused

of filing the incorrect return due to inadequate knowledge of the relevant
tax codes. In the integrity condition, the job applicant was accused of filing
the incorrect return intentionally. In both cases, the information was
hearsay. The recruiter did not have evidence of the candidate’s guilt or
innocence.
Violation response. Immediately after the trust violation was mentioned, the job candidate responded to the allegation by either apologizing
or denying responsibility for the act in question. In the apology condition,
the candidate admitted responsibility for the trust violation, apologized for
the infraction, and stated that such an incident would not happen again. In
the denial condition, the candidate denied responsibility for the trust
violation, attributed the allegation to bad office politics at the previous
firm, and stated that the firm would not have to worry about her committing
such an infraction if she were hired.

Measures
Several measures were developed to test the study predictions (see
Appendix). Separate multi-item scales were adapted to assess the two
trusting beliefs that were of interest in this study (i.e., perceived competence and perceived integrity). In addition, three separate measures were
used to assess participants’ trusting intentions toward the candidate. We
used a version of Mayer and Davis’s (1999) “willingness to risk” scale to
obtain a general assessment of trusting intentions, and we developed two
other measures (intention to hire and to assign job responsibilities) that also
capture participants’ willingness to make themselves vulnerable to the
accused party, but in a manner that is more relevant to this specific context.
Perceived Competence. Three items were adapted from Mayer and
Davis (1999) to assess perceptions of the job applicant’s competence.
Because the Mayer and Davis (1999) items were designed to assess the
trustworthiness of top management, we altered the items slightly to increase their relevance for the present study.
Perceived Integrity. Three items were used to assess perceptions of the
job applicant’s integrity. Similar to the competence scale, this scale was
also based on the integrity scale used by Mayer and Davis (1999) yet
altered to be more relevant to the present study.
Willingness to Risk. Three items were used to measure how much the
participants, in their role as manager, were willing to put themselves at risk
to the candidate. These items were adapted from a trust scale used by
Mayer and Davis (1999). One item was reversed-scored.
Hiring. Participants were asked to rate the likelihood that they would
hire the job applicant on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (definitely)
to 7 (definitely not). This item was reversed-scored.
Job Responsibilities. After responding to the hiring question, participants were instructed to assume that they had hired the job applicant, and
five items were used to assess the level of job responsibilities that should
be assigned to the candidate. The items were created to correspond with the
video, focusing on specific issues that could arise in an accounting firm.

Pilot Study
A pilot study was conducted with a separate set of 71 undergraduates to
determine whether participants would indeed possess some initial trust in
the job candidate and that unproven allegations of untrustworthy behavior
would be sufficient to violate this trust.1 This pilot study, therefore, asked
participants to watch the videotaped interviews and then assessed participants’ trust in the candidate immediately before and immediately after the
alleged competence- or integrity-based violation (but before the candidate
had offered a response). Means and standard deviations by condition for
this pilot study are reported in Table 1. Paired t tests revealed that
participant assessments of the candidate’s Competence, t(34) ⫽ 14.21, p ⬍

and assign Job Responsibilities to the candidate, t(34) ⫽ 11.32, p ⬍ .001,
were all significantly lowered by allegations that concerned matters of
competence. Similarly, paired t tests revealed that participant assessments
of the candidate’s Competence, t(37) ⫽ 9.70, p ⬍ .001, and Integrity,
t(37) ⫽ 11.52, p ⬍ .001 as well as participants’ Willingness to Risk,
t(37) ⫽ 10.33, p ⬍ .001; Hire, t(37) ⫽ 10.30, p ⬍ .001; and assign Job
Responsibilities to the candidate, t(37) ⫽ 10.87, p ⬍ .001, were all
significantly lowered by allegations that concerned matters of integrity.2
These findings provide clear and consistent support for our assumption that
unproven allegations of untrustworthy behavior are sufficient to violate
participants’ initial trust in parties with whom they have had no history of
interaction and thereby demonstrates the suitability of this context for
investigating trust repair.

Results for Study 1
Manipulation Checks, Descriptive Statistics, and
Convergent and Discriminant Validity
Participants responded to three manipulation check questions
(see Appendix) that assessed whether they recognized the nature of
the violation (competence vs. integrity) and the response to the
violation (apology vs. denial). Manipulation checks revealed that

These issues were examined in a pilot study, rather than the primary
study, to avoid potential demand effects (from having participants answer
the same set of questions three times) that could have clouded the results.
2
The fact that alleged competence violations also lowered perceived
Integrity and that alleged integrity violations also lowered perceived Competence may be due to our stopping the videotaped interviews immediately
after the allegation, which may have raised questions about whether information about inadequate integrity or inadequate competence, respectively,
would have been forthcoming.

sake of parsimony only, the single-step regressions are shown in
Table 4.
To assess Hypotheses 1a and 1b, we interpreted the significance
of the Interaction variable in Equations 1 and 2. Although the
predicted interaction was not supported for perceived Competence
or Willingness to Risk, the significant betas in the regressions
predicting perceived Integrity (␤ ⫽ .44, p ⬍ .001), Hiring (␤ ⫽
.20, p ⬍ .01), and Job Responsibilities (␤ ⫽ .14, p ⬍ .05)
supported the predicted interaction. To explore these significant
interaction effects, we conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis for
each of these three dependent variables (see Figures 1A and 1B).
The overall findings reveal that when the violation concerned
matters of integrity, participants’ perceptions of the candidate’s
Integrity and their intentions to Hire and to assign Job Responsibilities were all repaired more successfully when the mistrusted
party denied culpability for the act in question, whereas when the
violation concerned matters of competence, apology was generally
the more effective response. Thus, Hypotheses 1a and 1b received
support.

Hypothesis Tests

Mediation Analyses

We used effects coding (Cohen & Cohen, 1983) to create the
independent and interaction terms for the subsequent regression
analyses. Effects coding produces results identical to analysis of
variance (ANOVA), yet also facilitates the testing of mediation by
generating the ANOVA results in regression form. Following the
practice of effects coding, the two response conditions and the two
types of trust violation are each represented in the regression
equations by one effects coding variable. The violation-response
variable was labeled Apology/Denial (coded as 1 or ⫺1) and the
violation-type variable was labeled Competence/Integrity (coded
as 1 or ⫺1).
Table 4 presents the results of the regression equations testing
Hypotheses 1a and 1b.3 To test the prediction that the benefits of
apology versus denial for repairing trusting beliefs and trusting
intentions would depend on whether the violation concerned matters of competence or integrity, we created a multiplicative interaction term, combining the Apology/Denial and Competence/Integrity variables. We refer to this term in Table 4 as Interaction.
Because violation type and violation response were orthogonal as
a result of our experimental design, the single-step regressions
shown in Equations 1–3 of Table 4 present results that are identical
to hierarchical moderated regression analyses. Therefore, for the

To provide a more complete and precise understanding of the
trust repair process, we also examined whether the interaction
effects of violation type and violation response on participants’
trusting intentions would be mediated by their trusting beliefs (see
Figure 2). This possibility is suggested by the fact that (a) the types
of violations under consideration concern matters of competence
or integrity, (b) perceptions of competence and integrity represent
two of the most important elements of trusting beliefs, and (c)
these trusting beliefs have been theorized to influence trusting
intentions (e.g., Mayer et al., 1995; McKnight et al., 1998; i.e., the
beliefs that one holds about an individual should affect how one
intends to act toward that party). By following Baron and Kenny’s
(1986) guidelines for testing mediation, we conducted regression
analyses to examine (a) the effect of the manipulations on perceived Competence and Integrity, (b) the effect of the manipulations on Willingness to Risk, Hiring, and Job Responsibilities, and
(c) the effect of the manipulations on Willingness to Risk, Hiring,

An alternative set of effects coding analyses that controlled for our use
of graduate and undergraduate samples with a covariate revealed virtually
identical results.

and Job Responsibilities while controlling for perceived Competence and Integrity. Equations 1, 2, and 3, respectively (see Table
4), show the results of these tests. Because our primary interest
was whether trusting beliefs mediated the interaction of violation
type and violation response on trusting intentions, we interpreted
only the Interaction variable as the independent variable in the
analysis.
Equation 1 indicates that the Interaction variable significantly
influenced perceived Integrity but not perceived Competence.
Thus, only perceived Integrity satisfied the first requirement for
mediation. Equation 2 reveals that the Interaction variable exerted
a significant effect on hiring and job responsibilities. Thus, the
second requirement for mediation was satisfied for Hiring and Job
Responsibilities but not Willingness to Risk. Finally, Equation 3
reveals that the effects of the Interaction variable on Hiring and
Job Responsibilities became nonsignificant when the mediating
variables were added to the model, but perceived Integrity still

exerted a significant effect on these dependent measures. Thus, we
can conclude that perceived Integrity fully mediated the relationship between the Interaction variable and both Hiring and Job
Responsibilities.

Discussion
These results support predictions that the relative effects of
apology versus denial for repairing trust would depend on the type
of violation. Participants’ perceptions of the candidate’s Integrity,
their willingness to Hire, and their willingness to assign Job
Responsibilities to the candidate were all repaired more successfully when the candidate apologized for violations that concerned
matters of competence but denied culpability for violations that
concerned matters of integrity. Moreover, the results support the
notion that the effects of violation type (i.e., competence vs.

Nevertheless, an important question remains unexplored. Although this study focused on the implications of apology versus
denial for repairing trust in parties whose culpability in a violation
is unknown, it is quite often the case that the accused party’s guilt
or innocence is subsequently revealed. Given the significant role
such knowledge is likely to play in the determination of trust, it is
worthwhile to examine whether the aforementioned findings will
hold even after evidence about the accused party’s guilt or innocence becomes clear. Thus, we designed a second study to examine this possibility.

Study 2

integrity) and violation response (i.e., apology vs. denial) on
participants’ trusting intentions (i.e., Hiring and Job Responsibilities) would be mediated by their trusting beliefs (i.e., perceived
Integrity).

Figure 2.

Our objective in Study 2 was to determine whether the relative
benefits of apology versus denial for repairing trust after an alleged
competence- versus integrity-based trust violation would persist
even after the accused party’s actual guilt or innocence is subsequently revealed. We, therefore, modified our first study to offer
evidence concerning the mistrusted party’s guilt or innocence after
manipulating the type of violation (i.e., competence vs. integrity)
and the type of response (i.e., apology vs. denial). To the extent
that the effects of apology versus denial are primarily driven by
their divergent implications for guilt, the interaction between violation type and violation response should disappear once actual
guilt or innocence is controlled. However, our prior arguments
suggest that these responses would not only influence assessments
of guilt but also assessments of intended redemption and that such
redemption will be weighed more heavily for matters of competence than integrity. This suggests that the relative benefits of
apology versus denial for repairing trust after an alleged
competence- versus integrity-based trust violation will generalize
to cases in which the mistrusted party’s actual guilt or innocence
becomes known.
This conclusion does not imply, however, that knowledge of
guilt or innocence is irrelevant. Indeed, such knowledge is likely to
play a central role in the determination of trust. First, evidence
about innocence should of course positively affect trust, whereas
evidence about guilt should negatively affect trust. Second, we
expect that rather than eliminating the interaction between violation type and violation response, evidence about guilt or innocence
will influence the relative benefits of apology versus denial. Specifically, guilt information in the aftermath of a denial would
indicate that the denial was a lie and thus foster lower levels of
trust than if that party had offered an apology. Similarly, innocence
information in the aftermath of an apology would also indicate that
the original apology was a lie and thus foster lower levels of trust
than if that party had offered a denial. Thus, overall, we expect that
the relative benefits of apology versus denial for repairing trusting
beliefs and trusting intentions will depend on the availability of
guilt or innocence information.

Hypothesis 2a: When there is evidence that the accused party
is guilty, individuals will exhibit more positive trusting beliefs in the accused party if that party had responded with an
apology rather than a denial. When there is evidence that the
accused party is innocent, individuals will exhibit more positive trusting beliefs in the accused party if that party had
responded with a denial rather than an apology.

a description of the investigation that was identical across conditions and
then provided a ruling that was consistent with our experimental manipulation. In the innocent condition, the Board ruled as follows: “A thorough
independent audit of her client files indicates no evidence of malfeasance. Ms. Ballou’s record is cleared of all charges. She will remain
fully licensed as a Certified Public Accountant and retain all membership privileges in our association.” In the guilty condition, the Board
ruled as follows: “A thorough independent audit of her client files
indicates evidence of malfeasance on the part of Ballou. Her record will
reflect violation of tax codes 901.402(9) and 901.402(7) for this client.
The Board deems that she will remain fully licensed as a Certified
Public Accountant but the Board will reconsider this matter if there are
future violations.” These stimulus materials were created specifically
for the experiment, and were printed on “official” letterhead so they
would look realistic.

Hypothesis 2b: When there is evidence that the accused party
is guilty, individuals will exhibit more positive trusting intentions toward the accused party if that party had responded
with an apology rather than a denial. When there is evidence
that the accused party is innocent, individuals will exhibit
more positive trusting intentions toward the accused party if
that party had responded with a denial rather than an apology.

Study 2 used the same measures as were used in Study 1.

Study 2 used a 2 (violation type: competence vs. integrity) ⫻ 2 (violation

Convergent and Discriminant Validity

Participants

Participants responded to the same three manipulation check
questions that were described in Study 1, and a fourth question that
assessed the manipulation of guilt or innocence. Of the 444 participants, 327 (74%) answered all four questions correctly, 92
(21%) missed one question, 22 (5%) missed two questions, and 3
(0.7%) missed three questions.
Confirmatory factor analyses of the trusting beliefs and trusting
intentions variables (perceived Competence, perceived Integrity,
Willingness to Risk, Hiring, and Job Responsibilities) indicated a
good fit and supported convergent validity for a five-factor model,

statistics, reliabilities, and intercorrelations for these variables.

To facilitate the comparison of results across our studies, undergraduate and graduate students were also used as participants in Study 2
(N ⫽ 444). Three hundred twenty undergraduate students, enrolled in
introductory organizational behavior courses, participated in this study
for course credit, and 124 graduate business students from two organizational behavior courses participated in this study as part of an in-class
exercise. Undergraduate participants were 58% male, averaged 21 years
of age, and had an average of 7 months of full-time work experience
and 3 years of part-time work experience. Graduate participants were
68% male, averaged 28 years of age, and had an average of 4.5 years of
full-time work experience.

Task and Manipulation
Study 2 was identical to Study 1 except that, after watching the videotaped interview but prior to completing the questionnaire, participants
received information that confirmed or disconfirmed the accusation against
the candidate (i.e., the guilt or innocence manipulation). The guilt or
innocence manipulation was provided through a memo from the company’s human resources department, addressed to “all management in charge
of hiring,” stating that the State Board of Public Accountancy had investigated and ruled on the accusation. The memo summarized the ruling by
concluding that the candidate was innocent or guilty, and noted that the
State Board ruling was attached. The State Board ruling, in turn, provided

Hypothesis Tests
We again used effects coding to facilitate the comparison of
results across studies (see Table 7).4 The guilt or innocence condition was coded as ⫺1 or 1. Hypotheses 1a and b, which predicted
an interaction between violation type and violation response, were
supported for four of the five dependent variables. The beta coefficients were significant for perceived Integrity (␤ ⫽ .32, p ⬍
.001), Willingness to Risk (␤ ⫽ .19, p ⬍ .001), Hiring (␤ ⫽ .10,
p ⬍ .05), and the assignment of Job Responsibilities (␤ ⫽ .09, p ⬍
.05). Post hoc subgroup analyses (see Figures 3A and 3B) indicated that the pattern of results was consistent with Study 1: When
the violation concerned matters of integrity, participants’ perceptions of the candidate’s Integrity, their intentions to Hire, Willingness to Risk, and their willingness to assign Job Responsibilities
were all repaired more successfully when the mistrusted party
denied culpability for the act in question, whereas when the violation concerned matters of competence, apology was the more
effective response. Thus, Hypotheses 1a and 1b received support
even when information about the candidate’s guilt or innocence
had been revealed.
Hypotheses 2a and 2b predicted an interaction between violation
response and confirming information. We first noticed that evidence of innocence had a strong positive effect on all five dependent variables. Beyond this main effect, the interaction of violation
response and confirming information had a robust effect across all
five dependent variables. The effect was highly significant for
perceived Competence (␤ ⫽ ⫺.15, p ⬍ .001), perceived Integrity
(␤ ⫽ ⫺.27, p ⬍ .001), Willingness to Risk (␤ ⫽ ⫺.13, p ⬍ .01),
Hiring (␤ ⫽ ⫺.30, p ⬍ .001), and willingness to assign Job
Responsibilities (␤ ⫽ ⫺.16, p ⬍ .001). Consistent with our hypotheses, post hoc subgroup analyses (see Figures 4A and 4B)
indicated that evidence of guilt in the aftermath of a denial was

damaging to trust relative to evidence of guilt in the aftermath of
an apology and that evidence of innocence in the aftermath of an
apology was damaging to trust relative to evidence of innocence in
the aftermath of a denial. The results also suggested a three-way
interaction among violation type, violation response, and confirming information for Hiring (␤ ⫽ .08, p ⬍ .05) and willingness to
assign Job Responsibilities (␤ ⫽ .09, p ⬍ .05). Post hoc subgroup
analyses indicated that responses that were inconsistent with subsequent evidence concerning guilt or innocence were more damaging to trust when the violation concerned matters of integrity
than competence.

Discussion
The findings from this study replicate and extend the results
from Study 1, indicating that the differential effectiveness of
apology versus denial holds even after evidence concerning the
candidate’s guilt or innocence became known. However, the data
also reveal that participants’ perceptions of the candidate’s Competence, perceptions of the candidate’s Integrity, Willingness to
Risk, willingness to Hire, and willingness to assign Job Responsibilities were all repaired more successfully when the candidate
had apologized rather than denied culpability for a violation when
there was evidence of guilt but denied culpability rather than
apologized when there was evidence of innocence.
The fact that the relative benefits of apology versus denial for
repairing trust depend on the type of violation (i.e., competence vs.
integrity) even after the mistrusted party’s guilt or innocence
becomes known supports the notion that these responses do more
than simply signal the mistrusted party’s guilt or innocence. In this
second study, the candidate’s guilt or innocence was made clear,

An alternative set of effects coding analyses that controlled for our use
of graduate and undergraduate samples with a covariate again revealed
virtually identical results.

which allowed us to control for such considerations when examining the interaction of violation type and violation response. Thus,
the continued interaction between the type of violation and type of
response, after guilt or innocence information is provided, supports
our argument that apology and denial not only affect assessments
of guilt or innocence but also signal intended redemption and that
this redemption is weighed more heavily for matters of competence than integrity.
Nevertheless, the fact that evidence concerning guilt or innocence affected whether trust was repaired more successfully with
an apology or a denial indicates that this information does play an
important role. The finding that responses that were inconsistent
with subsequent evidence could prove detrimental to trust, even if
the evidence indicates innocence, supports our argument that the
inconsistency would induce suspicion and hence reduce trust.
Thus, we can conclude that simply selecting the most effective
response for a given violation (i.e., apologizing for competencebased violations and denying culpability for integrity-based violations) can pose a risk for trust repair efforts, given that trust may
be further damaged if the response is ultimately found to be untrue.

General Discussion
The purpose of this research was to investigate the benefits of
apology and denial for repairing trust. Although trust is widely
acknowledged to play a central role in organizational life, surprisingly little research has examined how trust might be repaired.
Moreover, the few studies that do exist seem to offer conflicting
recommendations.
Our efforts to address these limitations reveal that trust was
repaired more successfully when mistrusted parties (a) apologized
for violations concerning matters of competence but denied culpability for violations concerning matters of integrity, and (b)
apologized when there was evidence of guilt but denied culpability
when there was evidence of innocence. Thus, we can observe that
each of the conclusions drawn by prior research concerning the
relative effects of apology versus denial for repairing trust may
hold depending on the type of violation and the availability of
evidence concerning innocence or guilt.

Importance of Considering Specific Trusting Beliefs
Beyond these findings, this research also reveals that the implications of apology or denial on subsequent trusting intentions after

an alleged competence- versus integrity-based violation were mediated by the accused party’s perceived Integrity (i.e., a trusting
belief). These results are noteworthy for several reasons. First,
these results offer important insight into the mechanisms through
which these types of violations and responses to those violations
ultimately repair trust and thus allow us to place greater confidence
in our theoretical reasoning and conclusions. Second, given the
likely difficulty of repairing trust in many situations, assessments
of such specific trusting beliefs may prove particularly useful for
determining whether and how the repair of trusting intentions
might ultimately occur.
Finally, the need to examine specific trusting beliefs is heightened by the possibility that they may be differentially influenced
by various trust repair attempts. Although some effects were found
for perceived Competence, the strongest and most consistent patterns of findings were observed with perceived Integrity. Thus, to
the extent that there may be occasions when trusting intentions are
repaired more effectively by improving one of these trusting
beliefs rather than the other, we may gain greater insight into the
trust repair process if we pay particular attention to these specific
perceptions.

Implications for Research on Interpersonal Perceptions
These studies contribute to a growing body of research that
examines how organizational actors resolve differences in their
interpersonal perceptions. Research on how targets respond when
they discover how they are being perceived by others suggests that
potentially erroneous perceptions are not always repaired (see
Snyder & Stukas, 1999, for a review). Although there may be
times when targets are able to disconfirm such perceptions through
their behavior (e.g., by repairing trust), they often respond in ways
that lead these perceptions to be confirmed (e.g., by becoming less
trustworthy) or react in ways that neither validate nor dismiss these
perceptions (e.g., by terminating the relationship or simply failing
to repair trust; e.g., Jussim, Eccles, & Madon, 1996; Madon et al.,
1997). Moreover, a growing body of research indicates that there
may be important contingencies that affect which of these outcomes occurs, including the strength of the target’s selfperceptions, the target’s self-efficacy, and whether the perceiver
actually behaves in ways that help confirm their expectations (e.g.,
Eisenstadt & Leippe, 1994).
Along these lines, the present research suggests that the ability
of an individual to disconfirm another’s beliefs of untrustworthi-

fensive impression management tactics. Ashforth and Lee (1990)
defined these defensive behaviors as “reactive and protective actions intended to reduce a perceived threat” (p. 622). These behaviors include apologies and denials (i.e., categorized as justifying and misrepresenting behaviors, respectively) as ways of
avoiding blame (Ashforth & Lee, 1990; Tedeschi & Melburg,
1984).
The body of empirical research examining the effectiveness of
defensive behaviors for managing impressions is small and offers
mixed results. Stevens and Kristof (1995) measured defensive
behaviors as well as other impression management tactics in their
field study of employment interviews but did not examine out-

ness may also depend on differences in the way people assess
positive versus negative information about competence versus
integrity. The findings support the notion that although people
weigh positive information about others’ competence more heavily
than negative information about competence, they weigh negative
information about others’ integrity more heavily than positive
information about integrity. Thus, this study offers clear implications for how interpersonal perceptions, specifically of untrustworthiness, may be disconfirmed.

Implications for Impression Management Theory
The current research can also inform impression management
theory, specifically the portion of that literature focusing on de-

comes of the defensive tactics because they were so infrequent
(i.e., only 7 of 24 interviewees employed them). Wood and Mitchell (1981) found that nurse supervisors reported that they would be
less likely to discipline a nurse when she apologized for a performance failure than if she did not apologize, but they obtained
mixed support for whether the apology decreased expectations of
the nurse failing in the future. Moreover, Crant (1996) found that
an apology was relatively less effective for maintaining positive
impressions of a target than an excuse when responding to a
failure.
Yet our findings indicate that apology can be quite effective in
responding to some threats, in this case a trust violation, given that
apology was found to repair trust more successfully than denial
after a competence-based violation. These results indicate that
research on impression management could significantly benefit
from considering the type of violation when exploring the effectiveness of these different tactics. Moreover, our findings suggest
that defensive impression management tactics such as apology and
denial can backfire if they are not aligned with actual guilt or
innocence.

Practical Implications
This research also highlights two additional issues that deserve
particular attention by managers who must sort through allegations
and make attributions of trustworthiness. First, given strong support from both studies for the notion that trust is repaired more
effectively when mistrusted parties apologize for violations concerning matters of competence and deny culpability for violations
concerning matters of integrity, mistrusted parties may be tempted
to apologize for competence-based violations even when they are
innocent or to deny culpability for integrity-based violations even
when they are guilty. Although the results from the second study
may seem to mitigate these incentives by revealing that trust was
generally lowered by discrepancies between the type of response
and subsequent evidence concerning guilt or innocence, these
penalties may be insufficient to outweigh the incentives for such
lies to be used. When mistrusted parties were found to be guilty of
an integrity-based violation, for example, there was virtually no
detriment in the majority of the dependent measures (including
perceived Integrity) as a result of their having lied with a denial
rather than having apologized from the beginning (see Table 6).
This tendency to irrationally reward those who falsely deny
integrity-based allegations, by penalizing them little more than
those who admit their guilt, suggests that managers may need to
create stronger incentives for honesty, either by placing more trust
in those who have been honest or by placing less trust in those who
have lied.
Moreover, given that the actual behavior discussed in these
allegations was always the same (i.e., an improperly filed tax
return), these studies suggest that violations of trust may often be
ambiguous enough to be given different kinds of attributions. To
the extent that this can occur, it seems likely that the success of
trust repair efforts would largely depend on how the violations
have been framed. Managers should, therefore, recognize that if a
mistrusted party has responded to a violation with an apology or a
denial, their decision of whether to attribute this incident to matters
of competence or integrity is crucial because it will, in effect,
determine whether they will trust that person in the future. Indeed,
the implications of such attributions can be so dramatic that they

can lead managers to exhibit greater trust in those who have
confirmed guilt with an apology than in those who have claimed
innocence.

Limitations and Future Directions
The phenomena that have been documented by this article
represent important and fundamental aspects of interpersonal perception and relationship development. Thus, it is essential that
managers develop a better understanding of how such influences
occur. Although we believe the present studies offer some valuable
insights into these issues, we also recognize that they should be
further validated and extended in a variety of ways.
One limitation of the present studies is that they examined trust
repair efforts in a laboratory rather than a field setting. As previously noted, we selected a laboratory– experimental method to
heighten the internal validity of our analysis. Given the potential
variety of trust violations and individuals’ responses to those
violations in the workplace, and the sense-making and social
information processing that individuals experience in the aftermath
of such violations, it would have been very difficult to develop a
field test of our hypotheses that could have compared the effectiveness of different responses for different types of violations and
provided a strong basis for examining causality while also avoiding method bias and confounding effects. Our strategy, therefore,
was to abstract some of the essential elements of such violations
and responses so that we could study them in controlled settings.
Although this strategy should enhance external validity, additional
research is needed to assess the external validity of our findings
more directly.
Future research is also needed to examine the applicability of
the theory and findings to relationships of longer duration. Along
these lines, one prior empirical study has indicated that although
acknowledgements can be more effective than denials at reestablishing cooperation in social dilemmas after short interactions,
denial can be more effective than acknowledgements after longer
interactions (Bottom et al., 2002). Nevertheless, prior research
offers no reason to expect that the observed interactions between
the type of violation and type of response would fail to hold after
a history of interaction is acquired. Thus, we expect that the
practical implications of these findings will generalize to relationships of longer duration.
In addition, it should be noted that although the types of responses under consideration were found to influence trust, neither
of these responses appears to have repaired trust completely.
Comparisons of means from Study 1 with those of the pilot study
reveal that participants’ assessments of the candidate’s trustworthiness after an apology or denial had been offered were substantially higher than they had been immediately after a competenceor integrity-based allegation; however, they were still generally
lower than what they had been before such allegations were raised.
Thus, to the extent that the means from the pilot study are representative of trust levels in the main studies immediately before and
immediately after the allegation, it suggests that these responses
represent only a partial solution for addressing trust violations and
that additional research is needed to determine how trust can be
further repaired.
Another avenue for further study involves a comparison of
apology and denial with other types of responses that might be
used. The present studies, for example, have compared denial with

<-----Page 13----->REMOVING THE SHADOW OF SUSPICION

an apology that involved an internal attribution (e.g., “It was
entirely my fault”), but there are many occasions in which apologies involving external attributions (e.g., “I’m sorry I did it, but it
happened because I was misinformed”) or even no response can be
used. Thus, it would be useful to compare the implications of
denial, apology with an internal attribution, apology with an external attribution, and no response to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the responses we might use for trust repair.
Moreover, it would be worthwhile to consider responses that are
only available to organizations, such as the firing of employees and
the addition of new rules, regulations, or oversight committees, to
determine the conditions under which each of these responses
would repair trust more effectively.
Finally, research might explore how the relative value of various
trust repair efforts might differ across cultures. At present, this
issue is largely a matter of speculation, given that it has yet to
receive systematic attention. However, given the differences that
have already been found in how work relationships differ across
cultures, it is likely that there are also cultural differences in how
individuals are able to repair trust. For example, cursory observations indicate that individuals in many Asian cultures are much
less forgiving of violations, such as bankruptcy and divorce, than
are individuals in the United States. However, there is a clear need
for systematic work to help address this question. Indeed, given
how little we truly know about the trust repair process, it is hoped
that all of these questions receive significant attention in the future.
