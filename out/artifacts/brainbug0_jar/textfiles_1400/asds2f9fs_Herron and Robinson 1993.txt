Venture capitalists,
“angel” investors, and experienced, successful
entrepreneurs, when asked to identify the most important determinant of
new venture performance, will undoubtedly answer “the entrepreneur.”
SUMMARY
Likewise, prominent academic scholars responsible for the accelerating
development ofen~epreneurship theory and research wouid almost always
agree. Unfortunately, empirical and theoretical understanding uf the
in~uence of the entrepreneur on new venture performance (NVF) has long been stymied. Studies of
entrepreneurial characteristics have failed to demonstrate convincing links with entrepreneurial states
of being or with M/P, though studies of the former have shown more prombe than have those of the
latter. In an attempt to explain the failure to link entrepreneurial characteristics with performance and
thus to stimulate and modify research agendas, this paper derives a structural, causal model of the
relationships between entrepreneurial characteristics and performance. This derivation draws upon
current psychological, management, economic, and entrepreneurship theory.
Though there is considerable controversy in the field of psychology concerning the ability of
personality traits to explain behavior, it is accepted by many that such traits do exist, that they are
stable over time, and that they explain behaviors if the level of aggregation is wide enough. In 1988,
~olienbeck and Whitener noted that one of the problem in usingperso~~i~ traits to explain job
performance was that such traits are mediated by motivation and moderated by abilities in their causal
connection to performance. Thus personality traits are somewhat removed fi-om performance in the
causal chain of events.~pp~~ed
to the study of the entrepreneur, this research suggests that an initial
model of the “entrepreneurial characteristics -+ NVP” relationship must include the mediating role of
motivation and the moderating role of entrepreneurial management abilities.
This paper~rther redej%es this emerging model of “entrepreneuriai characteristics + NVP” by
drawing upon other literature from the field of psychology. This literature suggests that “entrepreneurial behavior” and the context in which it is performed both intervene between motivation and

ability in their relation to h%‘P. The paper concludes this section with a psychology-based model of the
“characteristics -r NVP” relationship that is more comprehensive and realistic than prior models ia
the entrepreneurship literature.
The paper next draws from strategic management, entreprenenrship, and economics literature
along with Sandberg’s (1986) model of NVP [NVP = ffE,lS,S)] to show that any model of the
connection between entrepreneurial characteristics and NVP must further recognize the relationship
between strategy and NVP as well as industry structure and NVP. The resultant model suggests strategy
and industry structure are “context” variables that interdependently interact with entrepreneurial
behaviors to influence NVP. This adaptation of the model is reinforced and expanded by reviewing the
management literature on matching managers to situations which in turn implies that the effects of
entrepreneurial behaviors on hWP are contingent upon strategy and industry structure. Thus strategy
and industry structure, though ultimately determined by entrepreneurial behavior, are themselves
important inputs to the behavioral context of entrepreneurship.
The last part of the paper examines decision-making, skills, aptitudes, and training as
components helping to rejine our understanding of the role of motivation as a mediator and ability as
a moderator in a model of the “entrepreneurial characteristics + NVP” relationship. The intent here
is to identify specific variables that can be studied or acted upon [in an applied sense] to improve the
NVP impact of entrepreneurial behaviors.
It is hoped that explication of this model will encourage future entrepreneurship research that
seeks to examine causes of NVP to reintroduce “the entrepreneur” as the focus or a focus of the
research. Hopefully a more fully developed model that includes motivations, abilities, skills, aptitudes,
and training as elements in “modeling” entrepreneurial behavior along with the needfor strategy and
industry structure contexts provides a more compelling and risk-worthy starting point for such research.
This should provide an impetus to put the entrepreneur back into a central position in entrepreneurship
research, where both theory and practitioners say helshe belongs.

INTRODUCTION
Studies of various entrepreneurial
characteristics have been conducted over the years with
great frequency. Indeed, within the field of entrepreneurship research, more empirical studies
involving characteristics of entrepreneurs have been conducted than have almost any other
kind (Churchill and Lewis 1986).
Such empirical studies generally fall into one of two generic types: those that attempt to
associate various characteristics with the state, or being, or entrepreneurship
(Sexton and
Bowman 1986; Brockhaus 1980b); and those that attempt to use characteristics to predict
performance among entrepreneurs or the businesses they run (Sandberg 1986; Brockhaus
1980a). It is notable that, despite the large numbers of studies of both types, neither type has
had much success in achieving statistical associations that are of practical and replicable
significance (Sexton and Bowman 1984).
A large portion of both types of studies have evolved around the research of personality
traits. These traits are usually thought of among psychologists as enduring characteristics of the
individual manifested in a consistent way of behaving in a wide variety of situations (Kimble
and Garmezy 1963; Krech and Crutchfield 1958). Sexton and Bowman (1984), who have
operationalized personality traits through the use of several pretested psychological instruments,
point out that studies of the first type have generally not contributed to research-based
understanding of the entrepreneur for several reasons. First, such studies frequently use differing
test instruments that purport to measure personality traits with the same name but with different
definitions. Second, these studies often lack clear definitions and comparable samples of
entrepreneurs. Third, they are often hampered by small sample size limitations on statistical
significance. Fourth, they often utilize instruments that are invalid because of inaccuracy,

<-----Page 2----->THE ENTREPRENEUR AND VENTURE PERFORMANCE

283

non-reliability,
or lack of construct validity. However, in research where some of these
objections are overcome, results from the first type of study yield statistical associations that are
of practical significance and are replicable (Sexton and Bowman 1984, 1986).
Results for the second type of study have not yielded much in the way of practical
significance even when overcoming some of Sexton and Bowman’s methodological pitfalls
(Begley and Boyd 1986; Brockhaus 198Ob). For instance, Begley and Boyd (1986) correlated
five measures of personality traits with each of three measures of venture performance for
entrepreneurs and found only two of the fifteen associations to be statistically significant.
Further, the most significant of these two explained only 6.8% of the variance in venture
performance.
In addition to personality traits, various studies of both types have investigated other
characteristics of entrepreneurs such as experience, education, and other demographics (Hoad
and Rosko 1964; Sandberg 1986). Like the personality trait studies, these studies have failed
to link those characteristics
either with the state of entrepreneurship
or with venture
performance.
Despite the apparent inability of these two types of studies to clarify the associations
involved, both academic theorists and practitioners such as venture capitalists persist in
classifying entrepreneurs as being identifiable personality types and in persuasively arguing
that venture success is more dependent upon the entrepreneur than upon any other factor
(Sandberg 1986). This failure of research to converge with theory and practice is quite
unsettling and, as such, is worthy of deep consideration.
In the following paper we draw upon current psychological, management, economic, and
entrepreneurship
theory to construct a structural, causal model of the relationships between
entrepreneurial
characteristics
and performance. This model explains the causes of the
problems discussed above and provides a guide to future research on the connection between
entrepreneurial characteristics and venture performance.

THE ROLE OF PERSONALITY TRAITS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP:
ENHANCED HOLLENBECK-WHITENER
MODEL

THE

The Relationship between Personality Traits and Behavior
In order to understand the role of personality traits in entrepreneurship,
it becomes important
to understand in some detail the relationship between personality traits and behavior.
Behavior is a specific set of observable actions (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975, p. 13), and is thus
contrasted with personality traits and other states of being that are unobservable constructs
purporting to explain behavior. The field of psychology has long studied and debated the
efficacy and stability of the predictive link between the two (Epstein 1979, 1980, Epstein and
O’Brian 1985):
“One of the classic debates in psychology concerns the stability of personality. With rare
exception, studies that have correlated objective behavior on two occasions have obtained
coefficients below .30 . . . The issue can be resolved by recognizing that most single items
of behavior have a high component of error measurement and a narrow range of generality
. . . It is normally not possible to predict single instances of behavior, but. . . it is possible
to predict behavior averaged over a sample of situations and/or occasions. (Epstein 1979,
p. 1097)”
Epstein and O’Btian (1985) also note that personality traits have proved remarkably
over time. In management
research, the work of Anderson and others (Anderson

1977;

<-----Page 3----->284

L. HERRON AND R. B. ROBINSON, JR.

Anderson, Hellriegel, and Slocum 1977; Anderson and Schneier 1978) is a useful example
supporting the longitudinal stability of personality traits. That research focused on locus of
control and coping behaviors of business owner-managers
whose businesses had been
destroyed by a flood following Hurricane Agnes in Pennsylvania in June 1972. Their locus of
control change numbers showed remarkable stability over a two-and-one-half-year
period
involving extreme emotional upheaval which might have been assumed to change the locus
of control of those owner-managers
studied.
This combination of longitudinal stability and increasing predictability with behavioral
aggregation may be presumed to be a partial explanation of why personality traits might be
made to predict the state of entrepreneurship (Sexton and Bowman 1984, 1986) while failing
to predict any given level of performance of entrepreneurship
(Sandberg 1986; Begley and
Boyd 1987). The set of behavioral events that leads persons to become entrepreneurs
presumably takes place over long portions of their lifetime and is thus composed of a higher
level of behavioral aggregation than is that set of behaviors determining
any level of
short-term entrepreneurial performance.

The Causal Link from Personality ‘kaits to Performance:
The Simple Hollenbeck-Whitener
Model
An understanding
of the nature of the causal linkage between personality
traits and
performance may be obtained by reference to a model published by Hollenbeck and Whitener
in 1988. This model simply states that the effects of personality traits on job performance are
mediated by motivation and moderated by ability. The model is based on a theoretical
formulation by Maier (1965) that job performance is a multiplicative function of ability and
motivation. In Maier’s formulation, job performance is taken to be a normative variable: the
evaluated result of a set of behaviors.
This model implies an additional reason why entrepreneurial
researchers have been
unsuccessful
in linking personality traits to performance:
if personality traits are both
mediated and moderated by other variables in their causal link to performance, they are likely
to display only weak direct associations with performance even though a causal link exists.
The model thus provides ample explanation as to why personality traits are insufficient
predictors of the success of entrepreneurial performance.

Expanding the Hollenbeck-Whitener
and Context

Model to Include Behavior

In Maier’s formulation, and in the Hollenbeck-Whitener
model, job performance is the
evaluation of a set of behaviors. While behavior is a specific observable action (Fishbein and
Ajzen 1975, p. 13) or set of actions on the part of an individual, performance is the evaluation
of the results of that behavior within the specific context. For instance, a behavior may be
modified as the result of improving an ability; whether or not this modified behavior will lead
to better performance depends partly upon whether and to what extent that particular behavior
is required by the situational context in question. Because behavior is viewed as a causal
determinant
of performance given the context, variables that affect behavior will also
necessarily affect the performance caused by that behavior. Personality traits affect behavior
(Epstein 1979, 1980) and thus are causal determinants of performance, albeit somewhat
removed from performance. This more detailed formulation leads to the enhancement of the
Hollenbeck-Whitener
model displayed in Figure 1.

Defining Entrepreneurship
An understanding of the failure of entrepreneurial characteristics research to explain
entrepreneurial performance necessitates more than an understanding of the link between
personality traits and performance; it also requires a clear understanding of the content of
entrepreneurial behaviors. Economists have been defining entrepreneurship in terms of
behavior since at least 1755 when Richard Cantillon first published his “Essai sur la Nature
Commerce en G&&al” (Hkbert and Link 1988). For Cantillon, the essence of
entrepreneurship was risk-taking behavior. The entrepreneur, said Cantillon, is one who buys
at a price that is certain and sells at a price that is uncertain (Hoselitz 1960). Since that time,
economists have variously defined en~epreneurship in terms of many other behaviors such as
decision-m~ing, sound judgment, supervision of pr~uction, innovation, and resource
reallocation (HiSbert and Link 1988).
Despite the diversity of economic views, two separate but connected threads link them
together. The first, as mentioned above, is that these economic definitions are behaviorally
oriented. Focusing on actions rather than on states of being, they mirror the dictum of Hoselitz
(1960, p. 252) when he states: “The task of developing a theory of entrepreneurship consists
in [sic] selecting those aspects of entrepreneurial behavior
which are most significant and in
determining the degree of generality with which they are found” [emphasis ours]. The second
theme consists of a trend over time among economic definitions: that of moving away from
entrepreneurial definitions consisting of pure risk-bearing capitalism such as those of Adam
Smith (Smith 1963), and moving toward ideas of managerial skills, states of mind, and
resource reallocation (Schum~ter 1934; Kirzner 1979; Schultz 1975, 1980).
Using Schumpeter’s (1934) definition, en~epreneurship will be considered here as that
set of behaviors that initiates and manages the reallocation of economic resources and whose

MODEL

Model

Sandberg (1986) developed a model of new venture performance and tested it empirically.
His model stated simply that new venture performance is a function of the characteristics of
the entrepreneur, the structure of the industry in which the venture competes, and its business
strategy [NVP = f(E,IS,S)]. This model is represented graphically in Figure 2.
Stripped of its strategy and industry structure variables, this model would represent the
simple implicit model used by most empirical researchers attempting to link entrepreneurial
characteristics to venture performance.

The Preliminary

VCP Model

NVP is a type of entrepreneurial performance that creates value through resource reallocation.
Sandberg’s full model could also be used as a more general model of value creation
performance (VCP) within any entrepreneurial setting, for instance complete reorganization
of an existing firm to foster a new competitive advantage, as opposed to creation of a new

venture per se. Also, since Schumpeter’s (1934) entrepreneurship can in general be performed
inside of older organizations and in non-profit or even governmental organizations as well
(Drucker 1985, p. 23), the term “industry structure” proves too confining. Thus we use the
term ‘“external environmental structure.” With these terminology changes, and in
combination with the enhanced Hollenbeck-Whitener model, Sandberg’s model provides the
basis for a preliminary but more sophisticated model of VCP (see Figure 3).
This preliminary model serves to highlight yet another reason why entrepreneurial
researchers have been unsuccessful in linking ~rsonality traits to buoyance.
Not only are
personality traits both mediated by motivation and modified by abilities in their causal link to
performance, they are further modified by context. Context is the environment within which
the behaviors take place and which sets the requirements that link the behaviors with
performance. A more detailed explanation of the interaction of context with entrepreneurial
behavior is given below.

and performance is contingent upon situational context, a context that itself is ultimately
determined by entrepreneurial behavior.
The failure of the empirical entrepreneurship
literature on characteristics to consider
contextual contingencies
suggests the application of models from other related literatures.
Helpful models may be found within the strategy implementation literature which attempts to
match managers to contextual situations (Wright 1974, Leontiades 1982; Szilagyi and
Schweiger 1984). These models show that two of the most important contextual variables
linking managerial
behavior to performance
are strategy and external environmental
structure, two variables shown to be of great importance to the performance of firms in
general (Hofer 1975; Porter 1980). Because strategy and external environmental structure are
also extremely important determinants of venture performance (Sandberg 1986), there is
strong theoretical reason to believe that they act as important contingency
variables in
entrepreneurial as well as managerial performance.
Possibilities
of contingency
relationships
between behavior and strategy in the
determination of performance are manifest. For example, if an entrepreneur has chosen a
strategy of product differentiation, the use of certain product design behaviors may be more
important than if he/she is exercising a low-cost strategy. Conversely, if a low-cost strategy
is being exercised, certain cost-monitoring
behaviors may become more important than if a
differentiation strategy is being used. If the scope of an entrepreneur’s strategy is relatively
broad, planning behaviors may become of key importance; if the scope is narrow, exercise of
leadership over employees in maintaining
the focus may instead become crucial. More
generally, given any particular sets of entrepreneurial behaviors, organizational strategy will
be a key to determining, as well as to defining, VCP.
Likewise, examples of possible contingency relationships between external environmental structure and behavior in the determination of VCP are also evident. In a turbulent
market, industry knowledge and opportunity recognition may be key to profits, whereas in a
more placid market, planning and certain other types of administrative behavior may be more
important to the attainment of VCP. If product homogeneity
is the rule in an industry,
cost-cutting behaviors may be key to VCP, whereas if product heterogeneity is the case,
exercise of certain product design skills may be more pivotal. In general, given any set of
entrepreneurial behaviors, a particular external environmental
structure will be instrumental
to causing, as well as to defining, VCP.
More generally, many other elements besides strategy and external environmental
structure may be important to defining and causing VCP as well, for example: organizational
structure. It is for this reason that strategy and external environmental
structure have been
shown in the model as component inputs to context rather than as the only direct modifiers to
behavior. On the other hand, these two constructs have been singled out in the model because
they have been shown to be particularly important contingency variables, both in the study of
organizations in general (Hofer 1975; Schendel and Hofer 1979) and entrepreneurship
in
particular (Sandberg 1986; Hofer and Sandberg 1987).

Behavior as a Cause of Strategy and External Environmental

Structure

As we have discussed, the behavior of the entrepreneur is modified by strategy and external
environmental
structure in its effect upon VCP. However, entrepreneurial behavior is itself
the causal antecedent of strategy as well as external environmental
structure (Child 1972).
Further, both of these variables can be modified by the entrepreneur, though sometimes with
difficulty. For instance, the entrepreneur may determine his/her external environmental

<-----Page 8----->THE ENTREPRENEUR AND VENTURE PERFORMANCE

289

structure at the outset of a venture and then find it more difficult to modify this environment
once the venture has begun to develop. However, even then it is usually possible for him/her
to modify the environment, for example by further niching (Porter 1980). Likewise, strategies
can be modified subsequent to venture creation (Porter 1980). The entrepreneur therefore
ultimately determines or, depending upon the circumstances
has at least the ability to
materially affect, both the strategy and the structure variables.
The next step in the model development will be to elaborate upon the causal antecedents
of motivation and ability.

Decision-making:

The Rational Link from VCP to Motivation

Like personality traits which are one of its antecedents, motivation is not a directly observable
construct. However in the enhanced model (Figure 3) where abilities and motivation combine
to determine
behavior, abilities cause behavioral
quality whereas motivations
cause
behavioral quantity. In other words, motivations determine which abilities are exercised,
when each is exercised, and how much each is exercised. For instance, when a behavior is
linked with an ability, motivation might be operationalized
by the amount of time that
behavior takes place, by the intensity of that behavior, or by some combination of the two.
Because behavior changes while personality traits are relatively static (Epstein 1979, p.
1097), motivation must have additional antecedents that change. Introspection tells us that
one of these antecedents is performance,
or the expectation of performance,
and that
sometimes the influence will be conscious and sometimes unconscious. Insofar as the process
is conscious, we can call it conscious decision-making.
It should be further noted that expectations of performance also can be either conscious
or unconscious, and that such expectations, and therefore motivation, will also be heavily
influenced by social learning (Scherer, Adams, and Wiebe 1989). Social learning theory
proposes that one can learn through the observation of others. For instance if one’s father had
been an entrepreneur, social learning might create expectations of a certain level of success,
thus effecting motivation either directly, or as a mediator of VCP, or as a moderator of VCP,
or more than likely as all three. These effects have not been shown explicitly in the model but
will be discussed later in the Implications section.

Exploring Abilities: Skills, Aptitudes, and Training
Maier (1965, p. 286) defined abilities as being of two kinds: (1) aptitudes (abilities as they
arise without training); and (2) achievements (abilities that contain the modifications that are
induced by training or practice). In other words, aptitudes are latent or promised abilities
whereas achievements are realized abilities ready for use at any point in time. In Maier’s
(1965, p. 286) formulation, he dispenses with the equivocal word “ability” and explains the
relation between aptitudes and achievements as follows:
Achievement

= Aptitude x Training

Achievements are abilities as they exist for use at any point in time and thus are the
clarification and more apt embodiment of the ambiguous “ability” used in our model in
Figures 1 through 3. But achievements
are exactly what Katz (1974) and Szilagyi and
Schweiger (1984) refer to as skills in the strategy implementation
literature when they refer
to the ability of managers to perform various tasks. Thus in the context of management
literature Maier’s formulation may be displayed as follows:

<-----Page 9----->3.8

-

A
TRAINING

Skill L:Aptitude x Training
and the word ‘“ability” in Figure 3 will thus give way to the word “skill” in Figure 4 ahove,
Skills are the ready abilities that entrepreneurs bring ta a situation at any point in time. They
are the result of both the natural aptitudes such as d~~e~ut~a~intelligence (Cuilford 196?) and
of the training and practice which the e~t~~~ue~r has had in previously exercising these
skills, In line with the usage of Maier [19&Q, ‘~~~u~ug~~may take @ace in rn~~ti~~eways, ft

The Effect of Skills on Motivation
Thelevel of the skills possessed will affect the motivation to use them. Bandura (1982) is one
of the foremost advocates of the role of self-efficacy in motivating performance:
“In applying skills, strong self-efficaciousnessintemifies and sustains the effort needed
for optimal buoyance, which is difficult to realize if one is beleae;ueredby self-doubts”

Other Characteristics of the Entrepreneur
The model development of entrepreneurial characteristics began with personality traits and
has progressed through skills, aptitude, and training. Other traits that have been studied in the
past such as educational experience, entrepreneurial experience, demographics, social
learning, and others would all enter the model through the auspices of training, aptitude, and
personality traits themselves.

PROPOSITIONS
Given our full model, the following research propositions have been developed and depicted
in Figure 4:
RPI: Personality traits are mediated by motivation in the determination of entrepreneurial
behaviors.
RP2: Motivation is moderated by skills in the determination of entrepreneurial behaviors.
RP3: Entrepreneurial behaviors are modified by context in the determination of VCP.
RP4: Organizational strategy affects behavioral context.
RP5: External environmental structure affects behavioral context.
RP6: Entrepreneurial behavior affects organizational strategy.
RP7: Entrepreneurial behavior affects the organization’s external environmental structure.
RP8: VCP affects motivation of the entrepreneur.
RP9: Aptitude and training interact in the determination of skills.
RPlO: Skills affect the level of motivation to perform them.

IMPLICATIONS
The failure of research on entrepreneurial characteristics to explain either the state or the
performance of entrepreneurship has led to an investigation of the link between
entrepreneurial characteristics and the performance of entrepreneurship. The resultant model
is based upon current economic, psychological, management, and entrepreneurship theory.
The implications of this model are numerous:
. The model explains the lack of results of previous research to link entrepreneurial
characteristics to performance in that it shows these variables to be both mediated and
moderated by other important variables, most notably strategy and relevant external
environmental structure.
l

l

l

Because the model shows that both skills and behaviors are more proximal to VCP
than are personality traits, it provides support for economic theory that implies
behaviors and skills to be more central to entrepreneurship than are traits.
The model provides a framework within which to group similar characteristics and
understand their causal link to VCP. For instance, experience and formal training such
as school would both have an impact on skills moderated by aptitude, whereas
personality traits work on behaviors primarily through motivation to perform various
skills and the intensity with which those skills are practiced.
The model highlights the centrality of behaviors to entrepreneurship thus supporting
those who call for further investigation of and emphasis upon entrepreneurial behavior
(Gartner 1988).

skills and aptitudes,

The suitability of the model to entrepreneurship in general, as opposed to strictly new
venture creation, both through the use of context variables and the VCP variable calls
for the application of the model to many and varied entrepreneurial situations, and for
comparisons between various types of entrepreneurship as well. For instance, it invites
research comparing the skills impacting the performance of corporate entrepreneurs
with those impacting independent entrepreneurs or public entrepreneurs.
The feedback loop from VCP, the causal connections of entrepreneurial behavior to
strategy and external environmental structure, and the connection between training and
skills imply the need for longitudinal studies involving entrepreneurial characteristics
and behaviors.
If the model stimulates research verifying the propositions it contains, this will allow
individual
portions of the model to be brought to bear in various types of
entrepreneurship
research. For example, empirical verification that strategy is an
important contextual variable modifying the influence of behavior on VCP would then
influence the design of future studies relating entrepreneurial behavior to VCP. We
have included examples of the possible operationalization
of the model’s variables in
Table 1 in an attempt to stimulate future research on this model.
The relative simplicity of the model suggests the need for further research into the
causes and effects of entrepreneurial
behavior on VCP. This model, as any other
model, is a simplistic abstraction from a very complicated reality. For example, the
above discussion on social learning theory shows that many variables and even groups
of variables remain to be considered as elaborations of the model. It is hoped that the
model will stimulate such research.
It is hoped that creation of the model will provide impetus toward putting the
entrepreneur back into a central position in entrepreneurship
research, where both
theory and practitioners say he/she belongs.

Last but not least, it is hoped that creation of this structural, causal model will lead to more
sophisticated research into entrepreneurial characteristics both by suggesting stepping beyond
purely correlational types of research into the investigation of mechanisms, and also through
suggesting the use of multidisciplinary
theory in model building. Both of these directions
