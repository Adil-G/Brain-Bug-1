The

Commitment-Trus
Theory of

Relationship
Marketing
Relationship marketing-establishing, developing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges-constitutes
a major shift in marketing theory and practice. After conceptualizing relationship marketing and discussing its ten
forms, the authors (1) theorize that successful relationship marketing requires relationship commitment and trust,
(2) model relationship commitment and trust as key mediating variables, (3) test this key mediating variable model
using data from automobile tire retailers, and (4) compare their model with a rival that does not allow relationship
commitment and trust to function as mediating variables. Given the favorable test results for the key mediating variable model, suggestions for further explicating and testing it are offered.

The

past decade has witnessed the inception of a major directional change in both marketing theory and practice. Consideredby Webster(1992, p. 1) to representa "fundamentalreshapingof the field" and by others to be a genuine paradigm shift (Kotler 1991; Parvatiyar, Sheth, and
Whittington 1992), the turn is toward relationshipmarketing, a concept thatencompassesrelationalcontracting(MacNeil 1980), relational marketing (Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh
1987), working partnerships(Anderson and Narus 1990),
symbiotic marketing (Varadarajanand Rajaratnam1986),
strategicalliances(Day 1990), co-marketingalliances(Bucklin and Sengupta 1993), and internal marketing (Arndt
1983; Berry and Parasuraman1991). Relationship marketing is part of the developing "network paradigm," which
recognizes that global competition occurs increasingly between networks of firms (Thorelli 1986, p. 47). Indeed,
Achrol (1991, p. 78, 89) forecasts the rise of "true marketing companies" within networks of functionally specialized organizations whose interrelationships, being norm

driven, are "held together and coordinated by market
drivenfocal organizations"by means of "norms of sharing
and commitment based on trust." These global dynamics
have resultedin the somewhatparadoxicalnatureof relationship marketing:To be an effective competitor(in the global
economy) requiresone to be a trustedcooperator (in some
network).As McKinsey & Co. strategistsput it (Bleeke and
Ernst 1993, p. 1), "For most global businesses, the days of
flat-out,predatorycompetitionare over.... In place of predation, many multinationalcompanies are learning that they
must collaborateto compete." Business ethicists also stress
that competition requires cooperation (Solomon 1992, p.
26):
Howevercompetitivea particular

two key characteristics posited to be associated with the
effective cooperationthatis requiredfor relationshipmarketing success. First,we examinethe natureof relationshipmarketing and suggest how this constructshould be conceptualized. Second, we theorizethat successful relationshipmarRobert

The Relational Exchanges in Relationship Marketing

The Nature of Relationship
Marketing
Understandingrelationshipmarketingrequires distinguishing between the discrete transaction,which has a "distinct
beginning, short duration, and sharp ending by performance," and relational exchange, which "traces to previous agreements [and] ... is longer in duration,reflecting an
ongoing process" (Dwyer, Schurr,and Oh 1987, p. 13). Categorized with referenceto a focal firm and its relationalexchanges in supplier, lateral, buyer, and internal partnerships, Figure 1 shows ten discreteforms of relationshipmarketing: (1) the partneringinvolved in relational exchanges
between manufacturers and their goods' suppliers, as in
"just-in-time" procurement and "total quality management" (Frazier,Spekman,and O'Neal 1988; O'Neal 1989);
(2) relationalexchanges involving service providers,as between advertising or marketingresearchagencies and their
respective clients (Beltramini and Pitta 1991; Moorman,
Zaltman, and Deshpande 1992); (3) strategic alliances between firms and their competitors, as in technology alliances (Nueno and Oosterveld 1988); co-marketingalliances
(Bucklin and Sengupta 1993); and global strategicalliances
(Ohmae 1989); (4) alliancesbetweena firm and nonprofitorganizations, as in public purpose partnerships(Steckel and
Simons 1992); (5) partnershipsfor joint researchand devel-

opment, as between firms and local, state, or nationalgovernments(Comer,O'Keefe, and Chilenskas 1980); (6) longterm exchanges between firms and ultimate customers, as
particularlyrecommended in the services marketing area
(Berry 1983); (7) relationalexchanges of working partnerships, as in channels of distribution (Anderson and Narus
1990); (8) exchanges involving functional departments
(Ruekertand Walker 1987); (9) exchanges between a firm
and its employees, as in internal marketing (Arndt 1983;
Berry and Parasuraman1991); and (10) within-firm relational exchanges involving such business units as subsidiaries, divisions, or strategicbusiness units (Porter 1987).
Thoughadequatelyconceptualizingrelationshipmarketing requiresa definition that accommodatesall forms of relational exchanges, extant definitions cover some kinds but
not others. For example, in the services marketing area,
Berry(1983, p. 25) states, "Relationshipmarketingis attracting, maintaining and-in multi-service organizationsenhancing customer relationships" and Berry and Parasuraman(1991, p. 133) propose that "relationshipmarketing concerns attracting,developing, and retainingcustomer
relationships."In industrialmarketing,Jackson(1985, p. 2)
refers to relationshipmarketingas "marketingoriented toward strong, lasting relationships with individual accounts." Paul (1988) adopts Jackson's view in the health
care marketingarea, as does O'Neal (1989) in his discusThe Commitment-Trust
Theory/ 21

<-----Page 3----->FIGURE 2

sions of "JIT procurement."Doyle and Roth (1992, p. 59)
indicate that "the goal of relationshipselling is to earn the
position of preferredsupplierby developing trustin key accounts over a periodof time." Definitionssimilarto the preceding can be found in the areas of bank marketing,advertising, and business strategy (Beltramini and Pitta 1991;
Prince 1989; Spekman and Johnston 1986). Conspicuously
missing from all extant definitions of relationshipmarketing is the specific recognition that many instances of relationship marketingdo not have a "customer" as one of the
exchange participants. Strictly speaking, in strategic alliances between competitors,partnershipsbetween firms and
governmentin public-purposepartnerships,and internalmarketing, there are neither "buyers," "sellers," "customers," nor "key accounts"-only partners exchanging resources. Therefore, to cover all forms of relational exchange and focus on the process of relationshipmarketing,
as stressed by Dwyer, Schurr,and Oh (1987), we propose
the following: Relationship marketingrefers to all marketing activities directed toward establishing, developing, and
maintainingsuccessful relationalexchanges.

The Commitment-TrustTheory
Drawing on the political economy paradigm, Thorelli
(1986, p. 38) maintains,"Power is the centralconceptin network analysis" because its "mere existence" can "condition others." In contrast,keeping in mind thatroughly onethirdof such venturesas strategicalliances are outrightfail22 / Journalof Marketing,July 1994

ures (Sherman1992), we argue that what should be central
to understandingrelationshipmarketingis whateverdistinguishes productive, effective, relational exchanges from
those that are unproductiveand ineffective-that is, whatever produces relationship marketing successes instead of
failures.Though there are no doubt many contextualfactors
that contributeto the success or failure of specific relationship marketingefforts, we theorize that the presence of relationshipcommitmentand trustis centralto successful relationship marketing,not power and its ability to "condition others." Commitment and trust are "key" because
they encouragemarketersto (1) work at preservingrelationship investments by cooperating with exchange partners,
(2) resist attractiveshort-termalternativesin favor of the expected long-termbenefits of staying with existing partners,
and (3) view potentially high-risk actions as being prudent
because of the belief that their partnerswill not act opportunistically.Therefore,when both commitmentand trustnot just one or the other-are present, they produce outcomes that promote efficiency, productivity,and effectiveness. In short, commitmentand trust lead directly to cooperative behaviorsthat are conducive to relationshipmarketing success.
Ourtheoryimplies what we label the key mediatingvariable (KMV) model of relationship marketing (Figure 2),
which focuses on one party in the relationalexchange and
that party's relationshipcommitmentand trust.Because we
hypothesize that relationshipcommitmentand trustare key

<-----Page 4----->constructs, we position them as mediating variables between five importantantecedents(i.e., relationshiptermination costs, relationshipbenefits, sharedvalues, communication, and opportunisticbehavior)and five outcomes (i.e., acquiescence,propensityto leave, cooperation,functionalconflict, and decision-making uncertainty).
Relationship Commitment
Drawing on the conceptualizationsof commitmentin social
exchange (Cook and Emerson 1978), marriage(Thompson
and Spanier 1983), and organizations (Meyer and Allen
1984), we define relationshipcommitment as an exchange
partnerbelieving that an ongoing relationshipwith another
is so importantas to warrantmaximum efforts at maintaining it; that is, the committed partybelieves the relationship
is worth working on to ensure that it endures indefinitely.
Our definition correspondsalmost exactly with that developed by Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande (1992, p.
316): "Commitmentto the relationshipis defined as an enduringdesire to maintaina valued relationship."Their "valued relationship" correspondswith our belief that relationship commitment exists only when the relationshipis consideredimportant.Similarly,their "enduringdesire to maintain" corresponds with our view that a committed partner
wants the relationshipto endure indefinitely and is willing
to work at maintainingit.
We proposethatrelationshipcommitmentis centralto relationshipmarketing.Thoughfairly new in discussionsof interorganizationalrelationships, commitment long has been
centralin the social exchange literature(Blau 1964; Thibaut
and Kelley 1959). Cook and Emerson (1978, p. 728) characterizecommitmentas "a variablewe believe to be central
in distinguishing social from economic exchange." More
specifically, in the marriageliterature,McDonald (1981, p.
836) concludes, "Clearly, the majordifferentiationof these
exchange relationshiptypes ... is the mutualsocial trustand
the resultantcommitmenton the partof the individualsto establish and maintainexchange relationships."
Commitmentalso is viewed as critical in the literatures
of organizationaland buyer behavior. Organizationalcommitment-one type of relationshipcommitmentthat is critical to the firm in its internal relationships-is among the
oldest (Becker 1960) and most studied (Reichers 1985) variables in organizationalbehaviortheory.In this context,commitment is seen as centralbecause it not only leads to such
important outcomes as decreased turnover (Porter et al.
1974), higher motivation(Farrelland Rusbult 1981), and increased organizationalcitizenship behaviors (Williams and
Anderson 1991), but it also results from such things that
can be influencedby the firm as recruitingand trainingpractices (Caldwell, Chatman, and O'Reilly 1990), job equity
(Williams and Hazer 1986), and organizationalsupport(Eisenberger,Fasolo, and Davis-LaMastro1990).
In the services relationship marketing area, Berry and
Parasuraman(1991, p. 139) maintain that "Relationships
are built on the foundationof mutual commitment." Similarly, the process through which consumers become loyal
to specific brandshas been widely discussed. Initially, loyalty was viewed as simply repeat buying. However, as the

field of consumerbehaviormatured,researcherscame to realize that "repurchaseis not sufficientevidence of brandloyalty" (Newman and Werbel 1973, p. 404) and that such
measuresas purchasepatternsincludedmuch "spuriousloyalty" (Day 1970). As brandattitudebecomes centralto the
repurchasedecision in relationalexchange,brandloyalty becomes increasinglysimilarto our conceptualizationof commitment. In fact, Assael (1987, p. 665) defines brandloyalty as "commitmentto a certain brand" arising from certain positive attitudes. Manufacturerssee brand loyalty as
key to superior performance and make efforts to build it
through providing superior benefits, promoting the firm's
values (e.g, "green marketing," corporate philanthropy),
and establishing an image as a trustworthymanufacturer.
A common theme emerges from the various literatures
on relationships: Parties identify commitment among exchange partnersas key to achieving valuable outcomes for
themselves, and they endeavorto develop and maintainthis
precious attributein their relationships.Therefore,we theorize that commitment is central to all the relational exchanges between the firm and its various partnersin Figure
1.
Trust
We conceptualize trust as existing when one partyhas confidence in an exchange partner's reliability and integrity.
Again, our definition parallels that of Moorman, Deshpande, and Zaltman (1993, p. 82): "Trust is defined as a
willingness to rely on an exchange partnerin whom one has
confidence." Both definitions draw on Rotter's (1967, p.
651) classic view that trust is "a generalized expectancy
held by an individual that the word of another... can be relied on." Both definitions also highlight the importanceof
confidence. The literatureon trust suggests that confidence
on the partof the trustingpartyresults from the firm belief
that the trustworthyparty is reliable and has high integrity,
which are associated with such qualities as consistent, competent, honest, fair, responsible, helpful, and benevolent
(Altmanand Taylor 1973; Dwyer and LaGace 1986; Larzelere and Huston 1980; Rotter 1971). Anderson and Narus
(1990, p. 45) focus on the perceived outcomes of trust
when they define it as "the firm's belief that anothercompany will perform actions that will result in positive outcomes for the firm as well as not take unexpected actions
that result in negative outcomes." Indeed, we would expect
such outcomes from a partneron whose integrity one can
rely confidently.
Absent from our definition of trust is the behavioralintention of "willingness" incorporatedby Moorman,Deshpande, and Zaltman.They argue that this behavioralintention is a critical facet of trust's conceptualization because
"if one believes that a partneris trustworthywithout being
willing to rely on that partner,trustis limited" (p. 315). We
arguethat willingness to act is implicit in the conceptualization of trustand, therefore,one could not label a tradingpartner as "trustworthy"if one were not willing to take actions
that otherwise would entail risk. More simply, genuine confidence that a partnercan rely on anotherindeed will imply
the behavioral intention to rely. If one is confident, then
The Commitment-Trust
Theory/ 23

<-----Page 5----->one would be willing; if one is not willing, then one is not
genuinely confident. We believe that, though it certainly
would be appropriateto have items incorporating "stated
willingness" in a measure of trust, willingness is unnecessary or redundantin its definition. Thus, just as behavioral
intention is best viewed as an outcome of attitude and not
as part of its definition (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975), "willingness to rely" should be viewed as an outcome (or, alternatively, a potential indicator) of trust and not as a part of
how one defines it.
Like commitment,trust also has been studied widely in
the social exchange literature (Fox 1974; Scanzoni 1979)
and others. For example, in organizational behavior, the
study of "norms of trust" is considereda characteristicdistinguishingmanagementtheoryfrom organizationaleconomics (Barney 1990; Donaldson 1990a). In communications,a
key constructhas been source credibility,originally defined
by Hovland, Janis, and Kelley (1953) as trustof the speaker
by the listener. In services marketing, Berry and Parasuraman(1991, p. 144) find that "customer-companyrelationships requiretrust." Indeed,they contend (p. 107), "Effective services marketingdepends on the managementof
trustbecause the customer typically must buy a service before experiencing it." In strategic alliances, Sherman
(1992, p. 78) concludes that "the biggest stumbling block
to the success of alliances is the lack of trust." In retailing,
Berry (1993, p. 1) stresses that "trust is the basis for loyalty." In automobile marketing, Saturn stresses "partnerships in which everyone sharedrisks and rewards," which
emphasizes "win-win role playing games stressing mutual
trust" (AdvertisingAge 1992, p. 13), and competing with
Japanese automakers,says Ford Motor Company, requires
relationshipswith its suppliersin which "there's a spirit of
trust" (Business Week1992, p. 27). In buyer-sellerbargaining situations,Schurrand Ozanne(1985) find trustto be central to the process of achieving cooperativeproblemsolving
and constructivedialogue. As in the organizationalcontext
mentioned previously, they also find trust to lead to higher
levels of loyalty (i.e., commitment) to the bargainingpartner. Finally, trust is viewed as central in studies conducted
by the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group (Ford
1990 and Hakansson 1982). Therefore, we theorize that
trust is central to all relationalexchanges in Figure 1.
Trust Influences Relationship Commitment
Trust is so importantto relational exchange that Spekman
(1988, p. 79) postulatesit to be "the cornerstoneof the strategic partnership."Why? Because relationshipscharacterized by trust are so highly valued that parties will desire to
commit themselves to such relationships(Hrebiniak1974).
Indeed, because commitment entails vulnerability, parties
will seek only trustworthypartners.Social exchange theory
explains this causal relationshipthroughthe principleof generalized reciprocity,which holds that "mistrustbreeds mistrust and as such would also serve to decrease commitment
in the relationshipand shift the transactionto one of more
direct short-term exchanges" (McDonald 1981, p. 834).
Therefore, we posit, as does Achrol (1991), that trust is a
majordeterminantof relationshipcommitment.Corroborat24 / Journalof Marketing,July 1994

ing our hypothesis, Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande
(1992) find thattrustby marketingresearchusers in theirresearch providerssignificantly affected user commitmentto
the researchrelationship.
Precursors of Relationship Commitment and Trust
Drawing on two decades of theory and empirical research
on commitment in organization behavior (see reviews by
Reichers 1986; MathieuandZajac 1990) and the recentlydeveloping commitment and trust literaturein marketing,we
identify five major precursorsof relationshipcommitment
and trust. Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we posit that
(1) relationshipterminationcosts and relationshipbenefits
directlyinfluencecommitment,(2) sharedvalues directlyinfluence both commitmentand trust,and (3) communication
and opportunistic behavior directly influence trust (and,
throughtrust, indirectlyinfluence commitment).
Relationship terminationcosts. A common assumption
in the relationshipmarketingliteratureis that a terminated
partywill seek an alternativerelationshipand have "switching costs," which lead to dependence (Heide and John
1988; Jackson 1985). Such costs are exacerbatedby idiosyncratic investments, that is, investments that are difficult to
switch to another relationship (Heide and John 1988).
Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh (1987, p. 14) propose that "the
buyer's anticipation of high switching costs gives rise to
the buyer's interest in maintaininga quality relationship."
However, it is certainly possible that no "switch" would
occur after the relationshipdissolves. For example, a terminateddistributoror retailermight decide (willingly or unwillingly) to discontinuecarryingan entire line of merchandise.
Even though no alternativerelationshipis established (and
no switch is made), thereneverthelesswill be costs incurred
from termination.Terminationcosts are, therefore, all expected losses from termination and result from the perceived lack of comparablepotentialalternativepartners,relationship dissolution expenses, and/or substantial switching costs. These expected terminationcosts lead to an ongoing relationshipbeing viewed as important,thus generating
commitment to the relationship. The "expected" in our
conceptualizationemphasizes that many business relationships are characterizedby great uncertainty.Indeed, facing
terminationcosts that are actually very high, a partnermay
be blissfully unawareof this fact and not be committed to
the tradingpartner.Conversely,facing total costs thatare actually very low, a partnerunfoundedlymay fear being terminated and be committed. Thus, it is the expectationof total
costs that producescommitment.
Relationship benefits. Competition-particularly in the
global marketplace-requires that firms continually seek
out products,processes, and technologies that add value to
their own offerings. Relationshipmarketingtheory suggests
that partnerselection may be a critical element in competitive strategy.As Webster(1991, p. 28) notes for industrial
marketers, "the firm's procurement strategy may be the
most importantingredient in its ability to deliver superior
value to its customers"(emphasisin original).Because partners that deliver superior benefits will be highly valued,
firms will commit themselves to establishing, developing,

<-----Page 6----->and maintainingrelationshipswith such partners.Malcolm
Baldrige Award winner Motorola recognizes the "two-way
street" characteristicof relational exchange and conducts
quarterlyconfidential surveys of majorsuppliersto trackits
own performanceat providingbenefits to its exchange partners (Moody 1992). Therefore,we posit that firms that receive superior benefits from their partnership-relative to
other options-on such dimensions as productprofitability,
customersatisfaction,and productperformance,will be committed to the relationship.
Shared values. Shared values, the only concept that we
posit as being a directprecursorof both relationshipcommitment and trust, is the extent to which partnershave beliefs
in common aboutwhatbehaviors,goals, and policies are important or unimportant, appropriateor inappropriate,and
right or wrong. For example, Heide and John's (1992)
"norms," because they refer to "appropriateactions," are
shared values. Similarly, Dwyer, Schurr,and Oh (1987, p.
21) theorize that shared values contribute to the development of commitment and trust.
Values are fundamentalto definitions of organizational
culture (Enz 1988; Weiner 1988). Schein (1990, p. 111)
holds that we can "distinguish three fundamentallevels at
which culture manifests itself: (a) observable artifacts, (b)
values, and (c) basic underlying assumptions." Values reflect culture when they are widely and strongly held
(Schein 1990; Weiner 1988). Because it provides what
many believe to be the best measureof person-organization
fit in employment settings (Caldwell and O'Reilly 1990;
Chatman 1991), shared values has become a variable of
great interestto organizationalresearchers,especially in the
organizationalcommitmentliterature(Chatman1991). Kelman's (1961) seminal work hypothesized that people's attitudes and behaviors result from (1) rewards or punishments, or "compliance"; (2) the desire to be associated
with anotherpersonor group,or "identification";or (3) having the same values as anotherpersonor group,or "interalization." Hence, the organizationalcommitment literature
often distinguishes between two kinds of commitment:(1)
that broughtabout by a person sharing,identifying with, or
internalizing the values of the organization and (2) that
broughtabout by a cognitive evaluationof the instrumental
worth of a continuedrelationshipwith the organization,that
is, by adding up the gains and losses, pluses and minuses,
or rewardsand punishments.Consistent with the organizational behaviorliterature,we posit that when exchange partners share values, they indeed will be more committed to
theirrelationships,but our definition of commitmentis neutral to whetherit is broughtaboutby instrumentalor identification/interalization factors.
Communication.A majorprecursorof trustis communication, which "can be defined broadlyas the formal as well
as informalsharingof meaningfuland timely informationbetween firms" (Anderson and Narus 1990, p. 44). Communication,especially timely communication(Moorman,Deshpande, and Zaltman 1993), fosters trust by assisting in resolving disputes and aligning perceptions and expectations
(Etgar1979). Andersonand Narus(1990) note thatpast communicationis an antecedentof trust,but "In subsequentpe-

riods ... this accumulationof trust leads to bettercommunication" (p. 45). Because we, like Anderson and Narus, test
our model at a specific point in time, we posit that a partner's perception that past communications from another
party have been frequentand of high quality-that is, relevant, timely, andreliable-this will resultin greatertrust.Although "communicationcan be described as the glue that
holds together a channel of distribution, ... empirical research on channel communication is sparse" (Mohr and
Nevin 1990, p. 36). Nonetheless, Anderson and Narus
(1990) find that, from both the manufacturer'sand distributor's perspectives, past communication was positively related to trust.Andersonand Weitz (1989) also find thatcommunicationwas positively related to trust in channels.
Opportunisticbehavior.The conceptof opportunisticbehavior from the transaction cost analysis literature is defined as "self-interest seeking with guile" (Williamson
1975, p. 6). As such, "the essence of opportunisticbehavior is deceit-orientedviolation of implicit or explicit promises about one's appropriate or required role behavior"
(John 1984, p. 279). Because opportunisticbehavior in organization economics "is assumed in the fundamentalaxioms, rather than treated contingently ... this is guilt by
axiom" (Donaldson 1990b, p. 373). Even though guileful,
self-interest maximization is axiomatic in transactioncost
analysis, empirical researchindicates that human behavior
may not be so Machiavellianafter all, especially not behavior in long-run relationships (Bonoma 1976; John 1984).
As originally suggested by Dwyer, Schurr,and Oh (1987),
incorporatingtrustin models of distributionchannelrelationships provides a uniquevantagepoint for treatingopportunism as an explanatoryvariable. Accordingly, we posit that
when a partybelieves that a partnerengages in opportunistic behavior, such perceptions will lead to decreased trust.
Ratherthanpositing a directeffect from opportunisticbehavior to relationshipcommitment, we postulate that such behavior results in decreased relationship commitment because partners believe they can no longer trust their
partners.
Outcomes of Relationship Commitment and Trust
Although, as components of the relationship development
process, relationship commitment and trust are, per se,
highly desirable "qualitativeoutcomes" (Mohr and Nevin
1990), we posit five additionalqualitativeoutcomes. First,
acquiescence and propensityto leave directly flow from relationshipcommitment.Second, functionalconflict and uncertaintyare the direct results of trust.Third, and most importantly,we propose that cooperationarises directly from
both relationship commitment and trust. We theorize that
these outcomes, especially the crucial factorof cooperation,
promoterelationshipmarketingsuccess. Because we model
and test these outcomes at a single point in time, we referto
the partner'sperceptionsabout these futureoutcomes when
commitmentand trust are present.
Acquiescence and propensity to leave. Drawing on the
organizationalbehavior literature(Steers 1977), we define
acquiescenceas the degree to which a partneraccepts or adheres to another'sspecific requestsor policies, and we posit
The Commitment-Trust
Theory/ 25

<-----Page 7----->that relationshipcommitmentpositively influences acquiescence, whereastrustinfluencesacquiescenceonly throughrelationship commitment. Conceptually, acquiescence parallels the performanceoutcome of compliance, as discussed
by Kumar,Stem, and Achrol (1992). Propensityto leave is
the perceived likelihood that a partnerwill terminatethe relationship in the (reasonably)near future (Bluedor 1982).
We posit thatthe strongnegativerelationshipbetweenorganizational commitmentand propensityto leave the organization (Mathieu and Zajac 1990) also will hold at the interorganizationallevel. Just as excessive employee turnoveris
costly for employers, partnershipinstabilityis costly. Therefore, "stability" is a desirable performance outcome
(Kumar, Stern, and Achrol 1992) that we posit can be
achieved throughfostering commitment.
Cooperation. Cooperation,from the Latin co, meaning
"together," and operari, "to work," refers to situationsin
which partieswork togetherto achieve mutualgoals (Anderson and Narus 1990). Even though coordination,which implies cooperation, has been known to be essential in such
areas as channels of distributionfor decades, the marketing
literatureon relationshipshas focused disproportionatelyon
power and conflict as focal constructs.For example, Ster
and El-Ansary (1992, p. 312) point out that a "central
theme" of channels of distribution theory and research is
that "interorganizationalcoordinationis requiredwithin a
marketing channel." But they go on to maintain that it is
the exercise of power that is crucial for much coordination:
"Power generally must be used in a marketingchannel to
... gain cooperation and induce satisfactory role performance." Why the focus on power? Because, as the epigraph quote from Alderson reminds us, marketers have
long noted the absence of a theory that explains cooperation. The commitment-trusttheory contributesto that longsought goal.
Harkingback to the paradoxof relationshipmarketing,
effective cooperation within a network promotes effective
competition among networks. Therefore, cooperation promotes relationship marketing success. Because conflictual
behaviors can coexist temporallywith cooperative actions,
cooperation is not simply the absence of conflict (Frazier
1983). For example, partners can have ongoing disputes
about goals but continue to cooperatebecause both parties'
relationshipterminationcosts are high. Nor is cooperation
the same thing as acquiescence.Cooperationis proactive;acquiescenceis reactive.Passively agreeingto advertisea partner's productis acquiescence;proactively suggesting better
advertisementsis cooperation.
Cooperation is the only outcome posited to be influenced directly by both relationshipcommitment and trust.
A partnercommitted to the relationshipwill cooperatewith
another member because of a desire to make the relationship work. Both theory and empiricalevidence indicate that
trust also leads to cooperation. Deutsch's (1960) findings,
using prisoner's dilemma experiments,suggest that the initiation of cooperationrequirestrust, and Pruitt(1981) suggests that a party will undertakehigh-risk, coordinatedbehaviors if trust exists. Similarly, Anderson and Narus
(1990, p. 45) state, "Once trust is established, firms learn
26 / Journalof Marketing,July 1994

that coordinated,joint efforts will lead to outcomes that exceed what the firm would achieve if it acted solely in its
own best interests."
Functional conflict. There always will be disagreements
or "conflict" in relationalexchanges (Dwyer, Schurr,and
Oh 1987). The hostility and bitterness resulting from disagreementsnot being resolved amicablycan lead to such pathological consequences as relationship dissolution. However, when disputes are resolved amicably, such disagreements can be referredto as "functional conflict," because
they prevent stagnation, stimulate interest and curiosity,
and provide a "medium through which problems can be
airedand solutions arrivedat" (Deutsch 1969, p. 19). Functional conflict, therefore,may increase productivityin relationship marketingand be viewed as "just anotherpart of
doing business" (Andersonand Narus 1990, p. 45). Several
workseitherproposeor find thatcommunicationandpast cooperative behaviors lead to the perception that conflict is
functional(Andersonand Narus 1990; Deutsch 1969). However, we posit that it is trustthat leads a partnerto perceive
that future conflictual episodes will be functional. Past cooperation and communication, we propose, result in increased functionality of conflict as a result of increasing
trust.
Decision-making uncertainty. Uncertainty in decision
making refers to the extent to which a partner (1) has
enough informationto make key decisions, (2) can predict
the consequences of those decisions, and (3) has confidence
in those decisions (Achrol and Stern 1988). We posit that
trust decreases a partner'sdecision-makinguncertaintybecause the trustingpartnerhas confidence that the trustworthy party can be relied on.

A Rival Model
An emerging consensus in structuralequationsmodeling is
that researchersshould comparerival models, not just test a
proposed model (Bollen and Long 1992). What, then,
would be a rival model? Note that our model posits that relationshipterminationcosts, relationshipbenefits,sharedvalues, communication, and opportunistic behavior-all of
which have been associated with important outcomes in
past research-influence their outcomes only through the
key mediating variables of relationship commitment and
trust. Because our extremely parsimonious model permits
no direct path from any of the five variables to any outcome, it implies a central nomological status for relationship commitment and trust. A nonparsimoniousrival view
that is equally extreme would be one positing only direct
paths from each of the precursorsto the outcomes, thereby
making relationship commitment and trust nomologically
similar to the five antecedents.The rival model (see Figure
3), therefore,allows no indirect effects; in other words, relationshipcommitmentand trustare not allowed to mediate
any of the relationships.Although no one has theorizedthe
rival model, it is implied by the numerousdiscussions and
empirical studies that consider relationship termination
costs, relationshipbenefits, shared values, communication,

and opportunisticbehaviorto be "independentvariables"directly influencingoutcomes. Examples include communication and cooperation(Assael 1969); opportunismand uncertainty (Williamson 1985, p. 58); communication and relationship "continuity," which conceptually parallels "propensity to leave" (Anderson and Weitz 1989); shared values leading to decreased propensity to leave (Chatman
1991); and relationshipterminationcosts leading to cooperation and/or decreased propensity to leave (Schermerhor
1975; Skinner, Gassenheimer, and Kelley 1992; Spekman
and Salmond 1992).

Method
Research Design
As the researchsetting, we used a nationalsample of independent automobile tire retailers. Although this industry
has elements of vertical integration,it still has independent
dealers. Because most tire retailerscarrya small numberof
tire lines, their relationships with suppliers are potentially
importantenough for the researchissues to be meaningful.
Restricting the sample to this somewhat homogeneous
population minimized extraneous sources of variation (a
plus), and the relatively large numberof producersand extreme competitive pressuresdue to overcapacityat the time
The Commitment-Trust
Theory/ 27

<-----Page 9----->of researchincreasedthe likelihood of therebeing large variance to be explained (a large plus).
Preliminaryinvestigation.The study began by exploratory field work that included soliciting the assistance of
local chapters of the National Tire Dealers and Retreaders
Association (NTDRA). In-depth,on-site interviews with officers of nine tire retailersin a medium-sized Southwestern
relacity explored issues relatedto tire manufacturer/dealer
tionships. From these interviews (and the literaturereview
discussed previously), a draftquestionnairewas constructed
and pretested on site with the same nine tire retailers.Respondents were encouragedto identify unclearitems, comment on the importanceof the researchissues, and suggest
changes. After making the requiredmodifications,the local
NTDRA chapterassisted in mailing questionnairesto a regional sample of tire retailers to determine if respondents
could/would complete the questionnairein the absence of a
researcher.No problems were presented during this stage,
and the final draft of the questionnairewas developed.

Sample characteristics. Our sampling method succeeded in providingrespondentswho varied greatly on personal and firm characteristics.Respondents varied widely
in age (< 35 years of age, 13.3%; 36-45 years of age,
29.1%; 46-55 years of age, 31.6%; > 56 years of age, 26%;
x = 48 years of age, s.d. = 10.8), education (< high school
diploma, 15.3%; some college, 34.0%; college degree,
38.6%;andgraduatework, 12.2%),and years of businessexperience (< 10 years, 6.6%; 11-20 years, 26.5%; 21-30
years, 33.7%; and > 30 years, 33.1%; = 26.5 years, s.d. =
10.2), though the sample was made up almost entirely of
males (98.4%). The firms representedin the sample varied
in size, as measured by annual sales (< $500,000, 11.3%;
$500,001-$1 million, 29.0%; $1-$2 million, 26.9%; $2-$5
million, 19.4%; and > $5 million, 13.4%;x= $2.8 million,
s.d. = $4.4 million) or employees (< 10, 38.2%; 10-19,
26.6%; 20-49, 23.1%; and > 50, 12.0%). Finally, the average respondent purchased 54% (range = 10-100%, s.d. =
24.2) of their tire inventory from the supplier they identified as their "major supplier."

Data Collection

Measures

Data were collected using a self-administeredquestionnaire
sent to memberfirms of the NTDRA in two phases. During
the first, multiple copies of questionnaireswere mailed to
the presidents of the seven largest U.S. chapters of
NTDRA, all of whom had agreed to participate. We expected that,like Goolsby and Hunt(1992), using local chapters of the trade association would yield a higher response
rate than a mass mailing. Association presidentsdistributed
a total of 341 packets of questionnaires,introductoryletters,
and business reply envelopes to members at their monthly
chapter meetings. After members returned only 49
(14.37%), it was decided that a mass mailing not only
would allow for directresearchercontrol over questionnaire
distributionbut also would be as effective as the continued
use of local chapters.In phase two, therefore,1000 packets
were mailed to independent NTDRA members (new tire
dealers only) chosen at randomfrom the most recent membershipdirectory-after excluding all those in metropolitan
areas previously surveyed. Returnedquestionnairestotaled
129, for a response rate of 12.9% and an overall sample
size of 204 and response rate of 14.6% (204/1394)1.
Though sample generalizabilityis a common concernin social science research, especially when response rates are
small, it is importantto note thatat this point we are providing an initial test of a theoreticalmodel in a particularcontext. The importantissues here are (1) whetherour sample
is an appropriate context for testing our theory and (2)
whether our sample of respondentshas variance to be explained. Because we are not attemptingto generalize an establishedmodel to a new populationor projecta descriptive
statistic from a sample to some largerpopulation,the possibility of nonresponsebias is a nonissue in researchsuch as
ours (Hunt 1990).

All measures were analyzed for validity and reliability following the guidelines offered by Anderson and Gerbing
(1988) and Joreskog and S6rbom (1989). The resulting
measurementmodel X2(406)was 588.33 (p = .000). Appendix A contains measurecharacteristicsand sample measurement items. Here, we briefly discuss the origin of the measures used.

'This includes the nine responses acquiredduring the initial pretestwith
the nine local retailersinterviewed, as well as the 17 (out of a sample of
44, for a 38.6% response rate) responses received after the mail pretest to
the regional sample.

Focal constructs. Given our conceptualization of relationship commitment, it was essential that its measure
should captureboth the importanceof the relationshipto respondentsand theirbeliefs aboutworkingto maintainthe relationship. Though no scale existed at the inception of our
study for measuring commitment to an interorganizational
relationship,eight items in the organizationalcommitment
scales of Meyer and Allen (1984) and Mowday, Steers, and
Porter(1979) reflectedour definition.These eight were modified to reflect relationship,ratherthan organizational,commitment. Because the Dyadic Trust Scale of Larzelereand
Huston (1980) taps the majorfacets of trust,that is, reliability, integrity,and confidence, its nine items were adaptedto
measureinterorganizationaltrust.
Antecedentsof relationship commitmentand trust. Several of the items in the Meyer and Allen (1984) continuance
commitment scale focus on employment terminationcosts
at the organizationallevel. We modified nine of its items to
measurerelationshipterminationcosts. To measurerelative
relationship benefits, we adapted items from two scales
used by Anderson and Narus (1990) that measure "outcomes given comparison levels" and "comparison levels
given alternatives."Communicationwas measuredusing a
scale developed by Anderson, Lodish, and Weitz (1987).
The opportunistic behavior scale was derived from John
(1984). For shared values, we used Enz's (1988) twostaged procedure.That is, we asked respondents(1) the degree to which they would agree and (2) the degree to which
they believed their major supplier would agree with statements regarding the corporate ethical values in Hunt,

Wood, and Chonko (1989). Sharedvalues then were calculated as the difference between the two responses subtractedfrom 7 (to make high numbersindicate high shared
values). Items reflectingethical values were chosen because
such values are thought to be foundationalin relationalexchanges (Gundlach and Murphy 1993) and because Hunt,
Wood, and Chonko (1989, p. 86) find sharedethical values
to be "a significant and substantivepredictorof organizational commitment" in marketing.
Consequencesof relationshipcommitmentand trust. To
measure cooperation, we adapted the scale developed by
Brown (1979). No scales exist for measuringthe buyer'sperception of futureacquiescenceto the supplier'spolicies. Because measures of self-reportedintentions to perform specific behaviors (e.g., voting for a given candidate) commonly employ single items, a single item measurewas used
for intended acquiescent behavior. The propensityto leave
measure was adapted from Bluedom's (1982) measure of
employees' propensityto leave the organization.We developed a two-item scale that measures perceptions of future
functional conflict. The uncertaintymeasure was adapted
from Achroland Stem's (1988) scales for adequacyof available information(UINFO) and the degree of confidence of
the decision maker when making these decisions
(UCONF).

Results
Table 1 shows means, standard deviations, intercorrelations, variances,and covariancesfor the summatesof all research variables. Note that the standarddeviations for the
11 scales rangefrom 1.018 to 1.814 (mean = 1.401), indicating a substantialamountof variancein the responses. Most
importantly,standarddeviations for the seven endogenous
variables indicated high variance to be explained (mean =
1.647). Of the 12 scales' means, 5 are within one-half scale
point (and 9 within one scale point) of 4, the center of the
scales. This absence of skewness, when combined with the
standard deviations, suggests that our sample contained
both effective and ineffective relationships,at least on the
qualitativedimensions studied.

The correlationsin Table 1 provide an initial test of the
13 hypotheses. All 13 of the hypothesized relationshipsare
supportedat thep < .01 level. The absolutevalues of the correlations range from .279 to .759, the average being .476.
For a much strongertest of the hypotheses, we now test the
proposed model using LISREL, thereby holding constant
all 43 nonspecified structuralrelationshipsand accounting
for measurementerror.

Testingthe KMVModel
The KMV model was tested using LISRELVII and the covariancematrixshown in Table 1. Each single-indicantloading was fixed at .950 for the formative measure summates
and at each scale's coefficient alpha for reflective measure
summates.The exogenous constructswere allowed to correlate by freeing the (I matrix.The results, shown in Table 2,
indicate support (p < .01) for 12 of the 13 hypothesized
paths of the model, and 24 of 27 indirect paths. The proposed structural model's comparative fit index, CFI
(Bentler 1990), of .890 indicates a good fit, especially for a
model with such a large numberof constructs.Overall, the
KMV model performswell.
Buildingrelationshipcommitmentand trust.With the exception of relationship benefits -> relationship commitment, all hypothesizedpathsfrom the antecedentsto relationship commitment and trust were supported. Furthermore,
the squaredmultiple correlations(SMCs) for the structural
equationsfor relationshipcommitmentand trustwere high.
Over half of the variance(SMC = .552) in relationshipcommitment was explained by the direct effects of relationship
terminationcosts, sharedvalues, and trust, and the indirect
effects of shared values, communication,and opportunistic
behavior. For trust, even more of the variance was explained (SMC = .743) by the direct effects of sharedvalues,
communication,and opportunisticbehavior.
Outcomes of developing relationship commitmentand
trust.All the paths leading to the five outcomes were significant at the p < .001 level. The standardizedestimates for
the six hypothesized paths ranged from .252 to .561 (mean
= .442), suggesting that relationshipcommitment and trust

have considerable influence on variables that are theorized
to be importantfor relationshipmarketingsuccess. Indeed,
the model explains a substantialamount of the variance of
each outcome,as the SMCs reveal:acquiescence= .315, propensity to leave = .302, cooperation= .481, functionalconflict = .201, and uncertainty= .109. The total coefficient of
determinationfor the structuralequations is .810.

Testing the Rival Model
We compare (see Table 2) the proposedmodel with its rival
on the following criteria: (1) overall fit of the model-implied covariancematrixto the sample covariancematrix,as
measured by CFI; (2) percentage of the models' hypothesized parametersthat are statistically significant;(3) ability
to explain the variancein the outcomes of interest,as measured by squaredmultiple correlationsof the focal and outcome variables;and (4) parsimony,as measuredby the par30 / Journalof Marketing,July 1994

simonious normed fit index (PNFI) (James, Mulaik, and
Brett 1982).
Though the CFI for the rival model is slightly higher
(CFI = .959 versus .890), only 11 of 29 (37.9%) of its hypothesized paths are supportedat the p < .05 level (including only 7 of 29 (24.1%) supportedat p < .01). In contrast,
12 of 13 hypothesized paths (92.3%) in the KMV model
are supportedat the p < .01 level. Importantly,9 of the 11
significant direct effects in the rival are significantdirect or
indirect effects in the KMV model (the exceptions are
relationshipbenefits -- propensityto leave and relationship
benefits -> cooperation).Moreover,little, if any, additional
explanatorypower is gained from the additional 16 paths.
The rival's SMCs are acquiescence = .395, propensity to
leave = .352, cooperation= .561, functionalconflict = .235,
and uncertainty= .153. The largest incrementto SMC was
.080 (for acquiescence) and the mean incrementonly .058.

<-----Page 12----->The total coefficient of determinationfor the rival is actually less than that of the KMV model (.805 versus .810).
As is obvious from Figures 2 and 3, there is a greatdifference in parsimony between the KMV and rival models
(13 versus 29 paths). Because CFI does not accountfor parsimony differences, we compare the two models using
PNFI. Because PNFI is informed by both the goodness of
fit of the model and its parsimony, one commonly finds
that goodness of fit indices in the .90s translateto parsimonious fit indices less than .60 (Mulaik et al. 1989). The
KMV model's PNFI of .555 exceeds the rival's .228. Although no guidelines exist for determiningwhat is a significant difference in PNFI values, we note that to accomplish
a 7.8% improvementin CFI (from .890 to .959), one sacrifices 41.1% in PNFI (from .555 to .228). Such a sacrifice, it
would seem, is too great. Stated conversely, we accomplish
a great improvement in parsimony (from 29 paths to 13
paths) by sacrificing only 7.8% in CFI-a sacrifice seemingly worth making for the sake of parsimony.

Discussion
We first addressthe significance of conceptualizingrelationship commitment and trust as mediators of importantrelational variables. Then we discuss directions for further
research.

Relationship Commitment and Trust as Key
Mediating Constructs
In relationship marketing, what are the roles of commitment and trust?Are relationshipcommitmentand trustjust
two more "independent" variablesthatinfluence outcomes
or are they somehow central to relationshipmarketingsuccess? Theorizing that commitment and trust are key variables that mediate successful relationshipmarketing,we develop a causal model containing 13 hypotheses that we test
in the context of automobile tire relationships.Correlation
analysis supported all 13 hypotheses and structuralequation modeling, a more powerful test, supports 12 of the 13
hypotheses. Not only do our hypothesized antecedentsexplain over half the variancein relationshipcommitmentand
trust, they also explain a substantial amount of the variances in five outcomes, including almost half of the variance of the crucial variable, cooperation.If cooperativerelationships are requiredfor relationshipmarketingsuccess,
our results suggest that commitment and trust are, indeed,
key.
Recognizing that our model is both parsimonious (13
paths) and extreme (only indirect paths are allowed from
the five exogenous to the five outcome variables),we compare it with a rival that is nonparsimonious(29 paths), but
equally extreme (no indirect paths are allowed). Although
customarygoodness of fit measures show acceptablefit for
both models, parsimonyclearlyfavorsthe key mediatingvariable view. Even though the rival has over twice the paths
(29 versus 13), the extra 16 paths from the "independent"
variablesexplain only a marginalamountof additionalvariance. Examining the paths not supportedin the rival also
suggests thatthe KMV model best representsreality.Surprisingly, not a single antecedentin the rival is significantly re-

lated to more thantwo outcomes-even though all these antecedent variables have been widely recognized as important in exchange relationships. The KMV model explains
this surprisingfindingby showing thatthe antecedentsdo affect these outcomes significantly, but only throughthe key
mediatingvariablesof relationshipcommitmentand trust.Indeed, all 18 of the indirecteffects of the antecedentson the
outcomes are supported(p < .01).
Finally, when correctedfor parsimony,the overall fit of
the rival model is less thanhalf thatof the KMV model. Philosophically, parsimony is a characteristicof theories that
science has cherished since at least the 14th century, when
William of Ockhamdeveloped the principle now known as
Ockham's razor. Philosophersof science long have argued
that the objective of science is not only to explain, predict,
and understandthe world in which we live, but to do so in
as efficient a manner as possible. Lambert and Brittan
(1970, p. 69), discuss the reasons that parsimony,or "simplicity," has been so importantin science: "Certainly of
two hypothesesequally satisfactoryin otherrespects,we habitually choose the simpler. Reasons are not hard to find.
The simpler hypothesis is usually the more elegant, more
convenient to work with, more easily understood,remembered, and communicated."The emphasis on parsimonyin
the structuralequations modeling literatureis fully in accord with philosophy of science (Bentler and Mooijaart
1989). Therefore,if the job of marketingscience is, whenever possible, to explain marketingphenomenaparsimoniously, our results clearly support the theory that commitment and trust are key mediating variables that contribute
to relationshipmarketingsuccess.
Relationship marketing success, in all its contexts, requires cooperativebehaviors. Indeed, as Van de Ven (1976,
p. 25) puts it, "the end objective of organizationsinvolved
in an [interorganizationalrelationship]is the attainmentof
goals that are unachievable by organizations independently." In the rival model, only relationshipbenefits and opportunisticbehaviorwere found to affect cooperationsignificantly. In the KMV model, however, all antecedents (except relationshipbenefits) were found to affect cooperation
significantly,and similarresultswere found for the otherimportantoutcomes as well. These findingsimply thatrelationship commitmentand trust are not only importantvariables
in marketingrelationships,as proposedby otherresearchers
(Achrol 1991; Becker 1960; Dwyer, Schurr,and Oh 1987),
but also are key mediating variablesin these relationships.
Identifyingcommitmentand trustas key mediatingvariables is critical to the study and managementof relationship marketing.To the researcher,if relationship commitment and trust were merely two more independentantecedents of importantrelationshipoutcomes, failing to include
their effects in studies of relationshipmarketingprocesses
simply would result in less variance explained among the
outcomes.However,as key mediatingvariables,failing to include theireffects in such studieswould resultin flawed conclusions regardingnot only the directimpact of relationship
commitment and trust on importantoutcomes, but the impact of other antecedents as well. To the manager, understandingof the process of making relationshipswork is suThe Commitment-Trust
Theory/ 31

<-----Page 13----->periorto developing simply a "laundrylist" of antecedents
of importantoutcomes-and our results imply that commitment and trust are key to understandingthe relationshipdevelopment process.
Directions for Further Research
Alternative approaches to construct measurement. Although our measuresperformedwell, it is certainlypossible
that better (or at least different) measures could be constructedfor several of the constructs.For example, relationship terminationcosts appearto increase relationshipcommitment. Furtherresearch could explore types of termination costs other than the economic costs studiedhere. Noneconomic costs, including the loss of "social satisfaction
from the association" (Dwyer, Schurr,and Oh 1987, p. 14),
as well as such sociopsychological costs as worry, aggravation, and perceived loss of reputationor "face," also could
contributeto the development of relationshipcommitment.
The hypothesized effect of relationshipbenefits on relationship commitment was unsupported-even though the
simple correlation (r = .316) was positive and significant.
(Such surprising findings as this show the value of structural equations modeling.) One possible measurementrelated explanationfor this finding is that relationshipbenefits were measuredas an evaluation of the supplieron the
facets of gross profit,customersatisfaction,and productperformance.In the future,researcherscould addressother potential benefits. Note that we measure relationshipbenefits
in a comparativesense, that is, benefits of the suppliercompared with those of a likely alternative supplier. Perhaps
many respondentslacked informationas to the characteristics of alternativesuppliers,or they had a tendency to focus
on the absolute level of benefits, not the relative benefits. It
is worth noting that the variance in relationship benefits
was one of the smallest of all studied variables (s.d. =
1.097). In the future, researcherscould try measuringsatisfaction with absolute levels of benefits.
By measuring shared values in terms of shared ethical
values, they contributedsignificantly to the developmentof
both relationship commitment and trust. However, other
types of shared values-for example, relating to product
quality, promotion tactics, or customer service-also could
further the development of commitment and trust in relational exchanges. For example, researcherscould focus on
the "norms" investigated by Heide and John (1992).
Finally, less than 11% of the variance in uncertainty
was explained by our model-the lowest for any outcome.
Given the wide range of idiosyncratic environmental factors that undoubtedlyaffect each respondent'suncertainty,
such low explained variance is unsurprising.However, it is
also possible that the types of decisions thatthe measureaddressed-that is, adequacy of information and confidence
in decisions for promotion efforts and inventory-may not
be as heavily influenced by trust in the trading partneras
are others. In the future,researcherscould explore otherfacets of the business, such as the provision of warrantyservice, investmentin relationship-specificassets, or searching
for alternativetradingpartners.For example, we would expect that marketerswho trust their tradingpartnersshould
32 / Journalof Marketing,July 1994

feel more sure-that is, less uncertain-about excluding potential alternatesuppliersfrom consideration.
Furtherdeveloping the KMVmodel. Although our tests
of the two competing models suggest that the KMV model
betterconceptualizesthe roles of commitmentand trust,allowing for direct effects for some antecedentsis suggested.
Of the five antecedentsstudied, opportunisticbehaviordisplayed the largesteffects, both direct and indirect.The sizes
of the rival model's direct paths from opportunisticbehavior to the outcomes suggest that opportunisticbehavioralso
may influence one or more outcomes directly. Indeed, the
LISRELmodificationindices suggest paths from opportunistic behaviorto cooperationand uncertainty.Therefore,we
urge researchersto evaluate an "extended" KMV model
that allows for both directand indirectpaths from opportunistic behavior to these variables.
Our results indicate that trust influences the way in
which disagreements and arguments are perceived by exchange partners. When trust is present, parties will view
such conflict as functional.Therefore,they can discuss problems openly because they do not fear malevolent actions by
their partners. Both the modification indices for the proposed model and the results of the rival model suggest that
communicationalso can lead directly to conflict being perceived as functional (independent of the indirect path
throughtrust).This "dual path" possibility would lend supportto Mohrand Nevin's (1990) view thateffective communication is crucial for obtaining high performance.Further
researchinvestigatingthe extended KMV model should determinewhetherthis "dual path" holds elsewhere.
Our test failed to supporta path from relationshipbenefits to relationshipcommitment.Although this failure may
be related to the measurementissues previously discussed,
structuralexplanations also may exist. One would expect
that the level of benefits received from the relationship
would be relatedstronglyto both satisfactionwith those benefits and satisfactionwith the overallrelationship.Globalsatisfaction customarily shows a strong relationship with all
forms of commitment (Williams and Hazer 1986)-which
may explain our positive (simple) correlationof benefits to
commitment.However, one also would expect strong associations between global satisfaction and our other exogenous variables (e.g., communication). Therefore, there
may be a global satisfaction "halo effect" that results in
the apparentrelationshipbetween benefits and commitment
disappearingwhen all exogenous variables are included in
the analysis. Researchersmay need to include this halo effect explicitly in their models.
Interestingly,though our results indicate that both commitment and trust are importantfor achieving cooperation,
the parametervalues suggest that trusthas the strongesteffect. Our measure of cooperation included cooperation
across five differentfacets of the business. Would this finding hold for other forms of cooperation?Furthermore,what
forms of cooperationare most conduciveto success?The organizationalbehaviorliteraturehighlights the role of organizational citizenship behaviors in success (Organ 1988).

ute to relationshipmarketingsuccess? These questions warrant furtherresearch.
Among the importantoutcomes we study here is acquiescence. Why do firms acquiesce to or comply with the desires of others? Marketing's traditional answer has been
that compliance results from the exercise (or one's fear of
the exercise) of power, which, since Hunt and Nevin
(1974), customarily has been divided into two types, coercive and noncoercive. However, to many academics, as
well as to most practitioners,the termpower implies, or at
least strongly connotes, coercion, that is, "do this or else!"
If one does not have the ability to force compliance, then
one may be said to have some degree of influence, but not
genuine power. For these academics and practitioners,noncoercive power is at best a non sequiturand at worst an oxymoron. In this vein, Young and Wilkinson (1989, p. 109)
argue that marketing's emphasis on power and conflict as
key concepts for studyingchannelshas "distortedthe understandingof how channels functioned.The emphasis was on
sick ratherthan healthy relationships."
Instead of acquiescence resulting from the exercise of
power, as in sick relationships,our results supportthe view
that in "healthy" relationshipspartnersacquiesce because
of their commitment to the relationship. In short, whereas
the exercise of coercive power yields compliance because
firms are compelled to do so, firms committed to the relationship acquiesce because they want to do so. Long-runre-

+

lationshipsuccess, we argue,is more likely to be associated
with the absence of the exercise of coercive power and the
presence of commitmentand trust.The precedingnotwithstanding, the commitment-trusttheory of relationshipmarketing does not deny the importance of understanding
power. Just as medical science should understandboth sickness and health, marketingscience should understandboth
functionaland dysfunctionalrelationships.Just as the KMV
model incorporatesopportunisticbehavior and its dysfunctional consequences, so also can an extended KMV model
incorporatepower.
Everyone acknowledgesthat power-here implying the
ability to compel compliance-indeed can result from dependence.Furthermore,dependencevaries directly with the
value received from a partnerand inversely with the availability of alternative trading partners (Cook and Emerson
1978). In our terms, feelings of dependencecan result from
relationshipbenefits and relationshipterminationcosts. We
also acknowledge that the exercise of power (based on dependence)in specific episodes can lead to a partner'sacquiescence. However, the continuingexercise of power to gain
acquiescencealso destroystrustand commitment,which decreases cooperationand inhibits long-termsuccess. As previous researchsupports(Lusch 1976), the use of power also
will result in conflict (of the dysfunctional kind). In summary,as shown in the extended KMV model (Figure4), we
hypothesizethatpower (1) resultsfrom relationshipterminaThe Commitment-Trust
Theory/ 33

<-----Page 15----->tion costs and relationshipbenefits, (2) positively affects acquiescence and conflict, and (3) negatively affects relationship commitmentand trust.The negative effect on relationship commitmentand trust over the long term will decrease
cooperation and diminish overall relationship success.
Power, then, like opportunisticbehavior,helps us to understand relationshipmarketingfailures. If marketingscience
should turn toward explaining relationshipmarketingsuccess-and we believe it should-power cannot be the central construct.
Limitations
The first limitation is the cross-sectional design employed.
In any model in which causality is suggested, longitudinal
studies provide for strongerinferences.Thus, the model developed and tested here could benefit from being tested in
a longitudinaldesign.
Second, the context of our study, automobiletire retailers, limits its potentialgeneralizability.On average,respondents in our sample purchasedroughly half (54%) of their
tire inventory from the supplier they identified as their
"major supplier." Certainly,some firms in other industries
would purchase more of their inventories from their major
suppliers (e.g., franchising operations such as automobile
dealerships), and firms offering a broader assortment of
goods or services (e.g., mass merchandisers,supermarkets)
would purchase much less from a single supplier. Perhaps
in industriesin which the percentageof retailers' total purchases from single suppliers differs markedly from the
range in our sample, the structureof relationshipsmight be
different. Therefore,not only would strict replicationusing
automobile tire retailersbe useful, but extending the study
to other partnershipsis definitely required.Because we theorize that commitment and trust are key mediating variables in all ten forms of relationshipmarketing,testing our
baseline model in such areasas strategicalliances,total quality management efforts, public-purpose partnerships,and
"internalmarketing" programsis required.Our reading of
the literaturein all forms of relationshipmarketingleads us
to believe that the commitment-trusttheory underlyingthe
KMV model should apply for all relationalexchanges-but
only furtherempiricalwork can confirm or disconfirmthis.

Conclusion
We explore the natureof relationshipmarketing,its conceptualization,forms, and requisites for success. Relationship
marketing,we propose, refers to all marketingactivities directedtowardestablishing,developing,and maintainingsuccessful relationalexchanges. With regardto any firm, there
are ten forms of relationship marketing, which can be
grouped into the relational exchanges involving suppliers,
lateralorganizations,customers,or one's own employees or
business units. The need for relationship marketing stems
from the changing dynamics of the global marketplaceand
the changing requirementsfor competitive success. Somewhat paradoxically,to be an effective competitorin today's
global marketplacerequiresone to be an effective cooperator in some network of organizations.If being an effective
cooperatorin some networkis a prerequisiteto being a successful competitor,what are the requisites for being a successful cooperator?The commitment-trusttheory maintains
that those networks characterizedby relationship commitment and trustengendercooperation(in additionto acquiescence, a reduced tendency to leave the network, the belief
that conflict will be functional, and reduced uncertainty).
All these "qualitativeoutcomes" contributeto overall network performance.If commitment and trust are key, how
can such characteristicsbe nurtured?We posit that relationship commitmentand trustdevelop when firms attendto relationships by (1) providing resources, opportunities, and
benefits that are superiorto the offerings of alternativepartners; (2) maintaining high standards of corporate values
and allying oneself with exchange partnershaving similar
values; (3) communicatingvaluable information,including
expectations,marketintelligence,andevaluationsof the partner's performance;and (4) avoiding malevolentlytakingadvantageof their exchange partners.Such actions will enable
firms and their networks to enjoy sustainable competitive
advantagesover their rivals and their networksin the global
marketplace.Our initial test of the KMV model of relationship commitment and trust in the context of a channel of
distribution has been encouraging. However, much more
work must be done. Our theory and the model need further
explication, replication, extension, application,and critical
evaluation. We offer them to the marketingdiscipline and
marketingpracticefor all these purposes.
