Habit and Intention in Everyday Life:
The Multiple Processes by Which Past Behavior
Predicts Future Behavior

Past behavior guides future responses through 2 processes. Well-practiced behaviors in constant
contexts recur because the processing that initiates and controls their performance becomes automatic.
Frequency of past behavior then reflects habit strength and has a direct effect on future performance.
Alternately, when behaviors are not well learned or when they are performed in unstable or difficult
contexts, conscious decision making is likely to be necessary to initiate and carry out the behavior.
Under these conditions, past behavior (along with attitudes and subjective norms) may contribute
to intentions, and behavior is guided by intentions. These relations between past behavior and future
behavior are substantiated in a meta-analytic synthesis of prior research on behavior prediction and
in a primary research investigation.

In everyday explanations of behavior, habits denote one's
customary ways of behaving. Claiming that one performed a
behavior because of habit provides an understandable explanation for an act that otherwise might seem irrational or even
harmful. Habits also are featured in the popular psychology
literature in the form of self-help books designed to identify
readers' existing habits, evaluate habits' effectiveness in meeting
goals, and establish more desirable habits. Habits are not, however, important constructs in most contemporary social psychological models of human behavior.
Early in their careers, most psychology graduate students
learn that frequency of past behavior, a standard indicator of
habit strength (Triandis, 1977, 1980), is the best predictor of
future behavior. This truism is typically paired, however, with
the caveat that the past-behavior-future-behavior relationship
is not especially meaningful. According to one version of the
argument, past behavior is simply a proxy variable for a multitude of psychological factors that generate consistency in response. Among the constructs that might be represented by past
behavior is attitude toward the action, and any link between
past behavior and future behavior might be due to this evaluative
disposition. Past behavior has been discounted also because of
the supposed limited explanatory value of behavioral repeti-

tions. In this view, the relation between past and future acts
represents little more than temporal stability. To illustrate this
point, Ajzen (1987) argued that it is not particularly illuminating
to say that a person is on time for appointments because he or
she has a tendency to be punctual. The definition of punctuality
is being on time. He concluded that " i t serves no useful purpose
to include past b e h a v i o r . . , in causal models of human action" (p. 41, italics in original). 1
These questions about the meaningfulness of past behavior
have excluded it from much of the empirical research predicting
future responses and have discouraged the development of theoretical explanations for past behavior effects. We believe, however, that it is useful to reconsider the role of past behavior. The
most compelling reason is the reputed success of past behavior
as a predictor of future acts. Researchers have not attained such
success at predicting behavior as to be able to dismiss this
(presumed) relation as error variance. Furthermore, the study
of established behavior patterns provides unique insight into the
prediction and control of behavior in a number of everyday
life domains, especially health-related behavior (e.g., medical
compliance, exercise). For practitioners interested in changing
habitual behaviors, successful intervention strategies depend on
understanding the factors that maintain routinized responses.
The present article draws on research in automaticity and
action initiation to identify the mechanisms through which past
behavior is linked to future behavior. In brief, we suggest that
multiple processes are involved. In domains in which habits
can develop, frequent performance in the past reflects habitual
patterns that are likely to be repeated automatically in future
responses. In domains in which habits are unlikely to develop,
behavior is likely to be controlled by deliberative reasoning

habitual responses in predicting behavior within rational reasoning models. He suggested that, when a goal has both attractive and repulsive
features, people's conflicting behavioral tendencies may be resolved in
favor of more routinized responses and familiar response patterns.

processes, and the effects of past behavior on future behavior
are mediated by intentions. These ideas were evaluated with a
meta-analytic synthesis of prior research as well as with primary
data.
Habits and Automaticity
We begin with a relatively bare-bones definition of habits as
behavioral tendencies. They are tendencies to repeat responses
given a stable supporting context. These patterns of response
probably develop in the same way as any skill acquisition. With
repetition and practice of a skill in a given setting, the cognitive
processing that initiates and controls the response becomes automatic and can be performed quickly in parallel with other activities and with allocation of minimal focal attention (Posner &
Snyder, 1975; Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977; Shiffrin & Schneider,
1977). Automatic responses also can represent nonvolitional,
frequent, and consistent experiences in a given context (see
Wegner & B argh's [1998 ] analysis of nonconscious perceptual
categorization). In contrast, the initiation and execution of nonroutine responses or responses in novel contexts require controlled processing, which is relatively slow, serial, and limited
by the capacity of short-term memory.
Automatic processing is closely dependent on stimulus constancy. Although no situation ever completely maps onto earlier
experiences, repeated response sequences proceed quickly without limiting processing capacity to the extent that the supporting
features of the current environment are similar to those contexts
in which the behavior was learned and practiced in the past.
The question of how much constancy is required has been addressed in some detail in research on transfer of learning (e.g.,
Heuer & Schmidt, 1988; Proctor & Dutta, 1993), and we note
here only that habitual responses are likely to occur with minimal thought and effort to the extent that the contextual features
integral to performing the response and one's behavioral goals
are similar across time and setting. Thus, stable contexts may
vary in superficial attributes, but they provide a constant supporting environment for performance. Unstable contexts are
ones in which shifts in the supporting environment present new
goals or challenge the smooth initiation and execution of practiced responses.
Although there is general agreement that habitual responses
are automatic in the sense that they can be performed quickly
in parallel with other activities and with allocation of minimal
attention, some earlier discussions of habit (e.g., Ronis, Yates, &
Kirscht, 1989) erroneously concluded that habits are thus nonvolitional and unintentional. Automatic behaviors can be nonvolitional or can be performed as part of volitional and intentional
action systems (Bargh, 1989, 1994; Logan, 1989; Posner &
Rothbart, 1989; Wegner & Bargh, 1998). Indeed, many established behavioral routines in daily life can be characterized as
both volitional and automatic (e.g., driving, exercise).
Intentions for Habitual B e h a v i o r
The idea that habits can be part of intentional behavior systems may seem counterintuitive. In phenomenological experience, habitual behaviors unfold in response to environmental
events, often without the formulation of any conscious intent to

55

engage in a specific sequence of action. For example, when
answering a telephone, few people consciously form an intention about which hand to use when lifting the receiver, what to
say, or what intonation to use when delivering the standard
greeting.
Well-practiced activities in constant contexts may appear to
the actor to be unintentional and nonvolitional for several reasons. The relevant intentions may not be accessible to conscious
awareness (Bargh, 1994; Bargh & Gollwitzer, 1994; Verplanken,
Aarts, van Knippenberg, & van Knippenberg, 1994). Although,
in the initial stages of acquiring a skill and performing a behavior, intentions may be consciously and deliberately formed in
response to environmental events, with repetition in constant
contexts, they may (like behaviors) operate autonomously with
minimal conscious guidance. As Heckhausen and Beckmann
(1990) argued, "intents resemble plans about how to act when
predetermined cues or conditions occur. Once formed, however,
the intents no longer require much conscious control. Instead,
they are triggered as automatic or quasi-automatic operations"
(p. 38).
Another reason that specific intentions are not likely to be
accessible for well-practiced behavior is that, with practice,
intentions come to be framed in general rather than specific
terms (Heckhausen & Beckmann, 1990). When learning a behavior or when performing a practiced behavior in difficult
or unpredictable contexts, intentions include details of how to
initiate, implement, and terminate the action; these specifics are
useful in decision making about performance. Thus, children
learning to use the telephone formulate specific, short-term intentions, such as holding the receiver close to the ear. With
practice in constant contexts, intentions tend to be represented
in a broader, more efficient manner. They reflect more stable,
longer term, and goal-directed strategies that highlight the functions of the act or the goals that will be met by the action
(Heckhausen & Beckmann, 1990; Vallacher & Kaufman, 1996;
Vallacher & Wegner, 1987). In our example, answering the telephone is then likely to be framed in terms of broad goals that
specify why the action is performed and what its effects are
likely to be: stopping the annoying ringing, identifying the caller
and intended recipient, and potentially initiating a conversation.
Well-practiced skills may thus possess the same functional
transparency to the actor as well-designed machinery does for
the operator (Vera & Simon, 1993); the functions served by the
action become salient, whereas the detailed mechanics (i.e.,
for skills, the specific behaviors, and corresponding intentions)
through which the outcomes are achieved become transparent.
Another related reason that intentions are not highly accessible for practiced acts is that, as behaviors are repeated in daily
life, separate responses and the intentions controlling them are
likely to be chunked into large, efficient units that include multiple behaviors. These action sequences may have automatic and
controlled components. The typical course of such semiautomatic response patterns is a string of autonomous phases, with
each phase running to completion once initiated. In between the
phases, some act of control is required, either to initiate the next
phase or to stop the process (Bargh, 1989). The duration of
autonomous processing phases in mental and motor tasks appears to be quite short, about half a second or less (Logan &
Cowan, 1984), and then some amount of conscious monitoring

<-----Page 2----->56

OUELLETTE AND WOOD

or direction is presumably required. Some researchers (e.g.,
Pashler, 1994) have questioned whether any acts can be truly
independent of attention. Even the well-practiced sequences in
routinized behaviors may not be truly automatic; they may appear to function independently of attention because, with practice in constant contexts, tasks can be prepared and executed
quickly, and whole sequences of responses may be selected and
loaded at the same time. Thus, for example, a standard greeting
between bus driver and passenger at the end of a workday can
be smoothly enacted while both continue uninterrupted contemplation of their evening plans.
In sum, in constant contexts, well-practiced behaviors are
repeated because of the speed and ease with which such responses can be performed. Performance of habitual behaviors
does not, however, require conscious intention.
Conscious Intentions and B e h a v i o r
Intentions also can direct behavior consciously through controlled reasoning processes: Rational reasoning models of action
outline how responses are guided by conscious intentions, which
represent plans of action in pursuit of behavioral goals (Ajzen,
1987, 1991; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Triandis, 1977, 1980).
Intentions are formed from salient beliefs about the outcomes
of an act. To be specific, intentions reflect attitude toward the
behavior, defined as the favorability of the consequences of an
act and the importance of these effects. From this perspective,
attitudes are linked to behavior through their effect on behavioral intentions (see also Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). Intentions
also reflect subjective norms (i.e., beliefs about others' wishes
as well as one's motivation to comply) and perceived control
(i.e., beliefs about how difficult it is to perform the behavior;
Ajzen, 1987, 1991).
The kind of reasoning that people engage in when consciously
deliberating about intentions depends on their level of motivation
and their ability and opportunity. Establishing intentions may
involve only minimal effort and superficial thought, as when
people retrieve intentions from memory or form intentions from
some heuristic cue such as others' judgments. Alternately, intentions may be formed through more extensive, thoughtful, systematic analysis (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). Implementation of
intentions may similarly involve minimal or substantial effort
and ability, depending on factors such as the difficulty of the
behavior and how easy it is to anticipate changes in the
environment.
In summary, we suggest that action generation and control
can follow two processes: (a) automatic repetition of past acts
and (b) controlled, conscious reliance on behavioral intentions.
Correspondence Between Habits and
Conscious Intentions
Intentions sometimes conflict with habits. A shift in the perceived consequences of behavior or in one's evaluation of those
consequences can motivate people to form new intentions. For
example, conscious intentions counter habitual patterns when
people attempt to change bad habits. Bad habits represent unproductive or undesirable behaviors that are well practiced and
proceed relatively automatically with minimal effort and guid-

ance. Bad habits may arise when acts yield outcomes that were
valued in the past but are not so any longer. Bad habits also
may represent acts that yield short-term rewards that are inconsistent with long-term intentions and goals. Alternatively, these
behavior patterns may have developed as side effects of other
intended acts, or it may be that behavioral tendencies that are
not especially valued in themselves (e.g., making a breakfast
of donuts from the office vending machine) were practiced because they were easy, efficient, and preferable to expending the
time and energy to establish more highly valued (e.g., healthier)
alternatives.
Conscious intents also may correspond to habits. When people are asked about their future behavior, either by interaction
partners in everyday settings or as participants in psychological
research, their responses express intent. Except when intents are
formed specifically to counter established responses (e.g., to
change bad habits), we suspect that intents typically are positively correlated with habits. This is because people are likely
to form favorable intentions about acts they have frequently
performed in the past. In the absence of extrinsic constraints on
behavior, people are likely to infer that they intended to perform
repeated acts and, because of cognitive consistency pressures or
through a self-perception process, they may generate consistent
intentions for future responses (Bem, 1972; Festinger, 1957).
Therefore, when people deliberately form conscious intentions, past behavior is likely to be a contributing factor. Past
behavior frequency might combine with the other predictors
specified in logical reasoning models, including attitudes toward
the behavior, perceived social pressure, and apparent ease of
performing the behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Others have speculated
that past behavior is indirectly related to intents through its
effects on these other predictors. For example, frequent past
behavior might be used to infer a favorable attitude toward
the behavior (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993), and intentions are then
derived from attitudes based on past behavior. In addition, past
behavior frequency might inform judgments of perceived control
such that high-frequency acts are judged under one's control.
These control beliefs might then affect intents (Ajzen, 1987).
In summary, the two modes of action generation and action
control, that is, automatic repetition of past acts and conscious
deliberation, represent two potential routes through which past
behavior affects future behavior. Frequency of past behavior can
affect future behavior directly, through automatic repetition of
previously established routines, or indirectly, mediated through
conscious intents to behave (cf. Eagly & Chaiken, 1993).

Habits and Intentions Jointly Predict Action
Given that action can emerge through both conscious and
nonconscious processing, people will sometimes have multiple
potential guides to action (for general discussions of this point,
see Bandura, 1986; Carver & Scheier, 1990; Hay & Jacoby,
1996; Heckhausen & Beckmann, 1990). How do habits and
conscious intents combine in the prediction of behavior?
Habits are enacted in parallel with other modes of behavior
regulation; they represent a default or baseline response. Habitual behavior is triggered by environmental events, and its performance requires minimal attention and deliberate control. Thus,

<-----Page 3----->PAST BEHAVIOR PREDICTS FUTURE BEHAVIOR
in contexts that encourage the development of habits, habits are
likely to be potent predictors of future responses.
When people's conscious intentions correspond to their habitual behavior, actions are likely to be cued directly by recurring
features of the environment and to be relatively automatic. When
intentions oppose habitual behavior, responses are likely to be
directed by intentions only insofar as intentions are powerful
enough to override the existing habits. New intentions need to
be held with sufficient strength and implemented with sufficient
skill to override well-practiced behavior. Continued control over
performance is necessary until the new response is established
with greater potency than existing habits. The continued effort
required to shift well-established behavior patterns is exemplified in the adage for weight control that "the price of thinness
is constant vigilance."
Overriding a habit is difficult for information processing as
well as for motivational reasons. Regardless of one's motivation
and opportunity to enact new intentions, suppression of established behavior may be sidetracked by "ironic" thought processes that bring to mind information relevant to suppressed
acts (Wegner, 1992). Thus, smokers who wish to quit may find
that their conscious decision not to smoke requires them to think
often about (not) smoking and so increases their preoccupation
with cigarettes.
In contrast, in contexts in which habits are not well established, either because the behavior is new or because the performance context is difficult or unstable~ behavior is likely to be
guided by conscious, controlled processes. It may seem obvious
that habits do not guide behavior in contexts in which they are
not available. In addition, however, shifts in supporting context
and the presence of unanticipated difficulties mute the impact
of the habits that are available. When past behavior cannot be
implemented in an automatic fashion, conscious deliberation
yields responses that are tailored to specific features of the
context. These behaviors may diverge from established patterns
even given stability in one's overall goals (e.g., the office vending machine that is out of donuts might spur a trip to a care and
a healthier breakfast rather than to a machine in a neighboring
building). The supremacy of controlled processing in such cases
is an adaptive solution that allows flexible shifts in behavior
that are tailored to special circumstances that differ from those
encountered in the past (Wegner & Bargh, 1998).2
The general idea that behavior can be controlled through
conscious and nonconscious processing is compatible with previous theorizing about the multiple processes by which attitudes
direct behavior (Ajzen, 1996; Bargh, Chaiken, Grovender, &
Pratto, 1992; Fazio, 1990). As with these attitude models, we
assume that, when people are motivated and able, they systematically form conscious intentions to act, which are based on a
variety of dispositions, including attitudes and, we posit, frequency of past behavior. The nonconscious mechanisms specified in attitude models, however, differ from the present approach. Automatic mechanisms in these models refer to unintentional, spontaneous effects of attitudes on conscious thought.
For example, Fazio has argued that attitudes accessible in memory can automatically bias conscious perceptions of the attitude
object and surrounding context and that these perceptions then
direct behavior. Although we recognize these nonconscious influences on thought, we propose that repetition of practiced

57

behavior in stable contexts can proceed with only minimal or
sporadic cognitive processing. Therefore, habit performance
does not involve any particular perceptions of the behavior and
the surrounding environment.3
Habit and Related Constructs
The present analysis of habit builds on an extensive past
literature. William James (1890) was an early proponent of the
habit construct; he suggested that habits possess motivational
properties, provide continuity to experience and behavior, and
maintain social structure. "Habit is thus the enormous flywheel
of society, its most precious conservative agent. It alone is what
keeps us all within the bound of ordinance, and saves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings of the poor" (James,
1890, p. 121 ). Early sociologists also recognized the usefulness
of the concept of habit and invoked it to account for the stability
of social institutions (Durkheim, 1902/1964; Mead, 1936; Weber, 1915/1946).
In psychology, habit assumed a prominent role in learning
theory accounts of social behavior. Habit was linked to conditioned response (E H. Allport, 1924; Watson, 1919), and the
concept of habit-based family hierarchies was used to account
for the differential strength of potential responses in a given
context (e.g., Miller & Dollard, 1941; Staats, 1965). In Hull's
(1943) stimulus-response theory, habit strength reflected the
extent to which a behavior had been reinforced in the past. The
role of reinforcement in habit formation is generally congruent
with our claim that habits develop as people repeat behaviors
that (at least during habit development) meet valued goals.
More recent theoretical analyses have considered habit from
an information-processing perspective. In predictive models of
health behavior, past behavior is thought to have direct effects
on future responses not mediated through conscious intentions
and decision making (Hunt, Matarazzo, Weiss, & Gentry, 1979;
Norman & Conner, 1996; Ronis, Yates, & Kirscht, 1989; Sutton,
1994). Information-processingperspectives share with the present view the ideas that habits emerge from response repetition
and that habits are guided by cognitive processing that is fast,
is easy, requires minimal attention, and proceeds in parallel with
other activities.
Given the various interpretations of habit in the literature, it

2Although the present research emphasizes response repetition and
context stability as determinants of the interaction between habits and
conscious deliberation, other factors are likely contribute to the relative
impact of these processes. For example, Triandis(1977) speculated that
individual differences are likely in the extent to which people establish
and rely on habits versus consciously deliberate about action. Some
people may be more likely to repeat past behaviors than others, and
some may be more likely to deliberate about future action.
3It would be incorrect to conclude that, in important behavioral domains, people engage in conscious monitoring and decision making,
whereas for less important, personally relevant behaviors, they follow
automatic, habitual patterns. Because automatic processes develop out
of frequent and consistent experience with the environment,they emerge
from stable goals and recurring experiences. Thus, habits are likely to
reflect important constancies in people's lives (see Bargh and Barndollar's [1996] idea of the wise unconscious) in addition to reflecting
routine, trivial events.

<-----Page 4----->58

OUELLETTE AND WOOD

has been important to distinguish habits from related constructs,
especially attitudes. G. W. Allport (1935) suggested that these
terms differ in level of abstraction: Attitudes range from the
general to the specific, whereas habits are always limited in
scope. Allport also noted that habits are not necessarily evaluative; because they lack directedness and favorability, they may
be less useful than attitudes in accounting for evaluative responses. Finally, he suggested that although habits are more
rigid than attitudes--more specific in their dependence on the
stimulus and more invariable in their expression--both dispositions have a conservative effect in maintaining existing response
patterns. Similarly, a contemporary definition of attitudes as
"a psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a
particular entity with some degree o f favor or disfavor"
(Eagly & Chaiken, 1993, p. 1 ) allows for separable attitude and
habit constructs and for unique effects of each on behavior.
Indeed, Triandis (1977) explicitly argued that the probability
of an act is a function of (a) habit (i.e., the number of times
the act has been performed in the past), (b) intention to engage
in the act (i.e., a composite of affect, attitude, and social factors), and (c) facilitating conditions.
The reader should note several additional constructs that can
be distinguished from habit. Scripts are knowledge structures
representing predetermined, stereotyped sequences of actions
in well-known situations (Schank & Abelson, 1977). Scripts
supposedly facilitate interpretation: They fill in gaps of missing
information, provide connectivity to pieces of information or
events, and allow prediction and anticipation of subsequent
events. Abelson (1981) suggested that "the difference between
a script and a habit is that a script is a knowledge structure, not
just a response program" (p. 722). In addition, Langer ( 1989a,
1989b) cautioned against equating the construct of mindlessness
with habits. Although both involve relatively effortless, invariant
behavior, habits are more closely linked to behavioral response.
In particular, habits derive from repetition of behavior and, instead of reflecting a general mental state of the organism as a
whole, represent a specific form of response (Langer, 1989b).
The Present Research
We conducted a meta-analytic synthesis of existing research
to test our ideas about the direct and indirect effects of past
behavior on future responses. When behavior has been practiced
frequently in constant contexts, it can be performed relatively
automatically, and future behavior should be a direct function
of past act frequency. When past behavior has not been repeated
often or when the context of performance changes or is difficult,
then behavior will require (at least minimal) deliberation. Responses are likely to be guided by consciously formed intentions
and from the attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of
control that constitute intentions. In such cases, past behavior
has a mediated effect on future responses through its impact on
conscious intentions.
We evaluated whether the behaviors in the studies in our
review were likely to support the development and performance
of habits. To identify whether the behaviors could be performed
with sufficient frequency, we classified studies according to
whether people have the opportunity to perform the target behavior (a) daily or weekly in the typical person's everyday life

(e.g., seat belt use, coffee drinking, exercise) or (b) only annually or a few times a year (e.g., flu shots, blood donation). To
identify the stability of critical features of the setting, we classified studies according to whether the target behavior was performed (a) in contexts in which enabling features are likely to
be stable (e.g., class attendance at college, church attendance,
clipping grocery coupons) or (b) less stable (e.g., nuclear protest behavior, new mothers exercising after childbirth).
Our hypotheses were as follows. Past behavior should have
a direct effect on future behavior primarily when people have
had ample opportunity to perform the behavior in stable contexts. Thus, past frequency of seat belt use should be a good
predictor of future use, given that participants are driving the
same car under constant circumstances. Conscious intentions
also should be a predictor in these contexts. When people do
not perform a behavior frequently despite considerable opportunity, or when people's intentions modify established habits (e.g.,
the decision to wear seat belts regularly), then intentions are
likely to be at least a moderate predictor of future acts.
Behaviors that people have had little opportunity to perform
or that occur in shifting or difficult contexts are likely to require
conscious decision making and control. In these domains, the
effects of past behavior on future behavior are likely to be
mediated by conscious intentions (and the attitudes, subjective
norms, and perceived control that contribute to intents). Past
behavior frequency thus should have an effect to the extent that
it contributes to intentions. For example, past blood donation is
not likely to have a direct effect on future frequency. Although
a person might report that she is a "frequent" blood donor, this
behavior can occur only a few times a year and the contextual
features surrounding the donation are not likely to be the same
every time (given that most donors do not have a regular appointment at a blood donation center). Thus, past donations are
unlikely to represent an established habit that repeats into future
behavior. Instead, future donations are likely to reflect conscious
intentions, and past donation frequency should be important to
the extent that it affects the intentions formed. Thus, for lowopportunity behaviors and for behaviors in unstable contexts,
we anticipated an indirect relation between past and future behavior, which is mediated by conscious intentions.
In summary, we expected that past behavior would predict
future behavior primarily in domains with high opportunity and
stable contexts and should have little effect in domains with
low opportunity or unstable contexts. Past behavior in domains
with low opportunity or unstable contexts should be an indirect
predictor of future behavior through its impact on conscious
intentions. We were less certain of the relation between conscious intention and future behavior. Given that such moderators
of habit effects as opportunity and context stability seem to
have little impact on controlled reasoning processes like intention (Hay & Jacoby, 1996), intention might be expected to have
similar effects across domains. Alternately, if habitual behavior
is automatically cued and is performed regardless of intention,
then intention should have its strongest impact when habits are
weak or cannot be executed, that is, in domains with low opportunity or unstable contexts.
How does past behavior contribute to intentions? We suggest
above that past behavior can directly inform intentions for future
responses through self-perception (Bem, 1972) and cognitive

<-----Page 5----->PAST BEHAVIOR PREDICTS FUTURE BEHAVIOR
consistency processes (Festinger, 1957). Past b e h a v i o r also can
contribute indirectly to intentions by affecting attitudes, perceived normative pressure, and perceived control. That is, the
same self-perception and cognitive consistency processes may
yield inferences about attitudes, normative pressure, and perceived control that are consistent with frequency of past performance. More frequent past b e h a v i o r is likely to yield more
favorable attitudes, positive perceptions of normative pressure,
and greater control (i.e., less difficulty performing the behavior), and these factors might then contribute to favorable intentions. We e x a m i n e d these other predictors o f intentions and
future b e h a v i o r in order to identify the independent effects of
past b e h a v i o r after controlling for attitudes, subjective norms,
and perceived control. We anticipated that past b e h a v i o r would
predict intentions and future b e h a v i o r in its o w n right and not
because it forms the basis for favorable or unfavorable attitudes
toward the b e h a v i o r (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) or because it
affects judgments o f perceived control (Ajzen, 1987).
We were able to provide additional insight into the relation
between past b e h a v i o r and intentions by evaluating the way that
intention was operationalized in the studies in our review. Some
studies measured intentions in terms of participants' expectations for performing a b e h a v i o r in the future. Given that measures of behavioral expectations represent estimates of typical
performance (cf. Warshaw & Davis, 1985), they are likely to
be highly dependent on frequency of past acts. Other studies
assessed participants' explicit plans to perform a behavior. Because these behavioral intentions involve explicit planning and
goal setting, they m a y not be as closely dependent on past act
frequency as expectation intentions.
We did not anticipate that opportunity to perform an act or
context stability would have much effect on the predictors of
intention in rational reasoning models. Because opportunity and
stability are unlikely to be important determinants of intentional
reasoning, the effects of attitudes, norms, and perceived control
on intention should not vary with these moderators.
Method

Identification o f Sample
Computerized literature searches were conducted in PsycLIT (19741994), Sociofile (1974-1994), and Dissertation Abstracts (18671994) with the terms habit and past behavior in conjunction with the
terms attitude and behavior. Additionally, nonelectronic searches were
conducted in PsychologicalAbstracts (1920-1973 ) and the Annotated
Subject Index and the Author/Title Index of the Journal of Marketing
Research ( 1986-1993). Articles also were identified from prior reviews
(e,g., Sheppard, Hartwick, & Warshaw, 1988), from bibliographies of
research on the theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior
(Ajzen, 1996; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1995), and from the reference sections
of included articles. Thus, articles and manuscripts that appeared in the
literature prior to 1995 were included in the review.

Selection Criteria
Articles were included in the review if they used measures of past
behavior frequency to predict behavioral intention or subsequent behavior. In addition, because we wished to differentiate the effects of past
behavior from attitudes, we did not include the few studies that failed
to obtain an attitude measure (e.g., Landis, Triandis, & Adamopoulos,

59

1978; Valois, Shephard, & Godin, 1986). In addition, to maximize the
prediction of behavior, we restricted the review to those studies in which
the measures (i.e., of attitude, intention, past behavior) referenced a
common attitude object (see Ajzen and Fishbein's [1977] principle of
correspondence). Thus, we did not include the few studies in which the
attitude measure assessed an object (e.g., healthy diet) that differed
from the intention-behavior measure (e.g., exercise; see Croll, 1983;
Kilty & Behling, 1985). We attempted to apply minimal criteria for
exclusion and retained studies even if the measures did not correspond
on dimensions of context and time. Finally, studies were excluded if,
before data were collected on all measures, participants were exposed
to an intervention designed to change their dispositions or behaviors
(e.g., Zimmerman, 1983).
We identified 60 separate research reports. The multiple studies in
several reports yielded a total of 64 independent studies in the review.

Coding o f Studies
Each study was coded by two independent raters for the following
characteristics: (a) operational definition of habit (behavior in the past
week to a year, behavior from 3 years to a lifetime, a composite representing weekly frequency multiplied by intensity [see Godin, 1983], or
other); (b) number of questionnaire items in the measure of habit; (c)
number of questionnaire items in measure of behavior; (d) number of
questionnaire items in measure of intentions; (e) wording of intentions
measure (behavioral intention vs, behavioral expectation); (f) as best
as could be ascertained from the procedure section of the methodology,
order of assessment of habit and intention measures (past behavior first
vs. intention first); (g) the stability of the environmental context in
which the behavior was typically performed (stable vs. less stable); (h)
opportunity to perform the behavior in daily life (every day, several
times a week, or weekly vs. annually or biannually); (i) percentage of
female participants; (j) year of publication or study completion; (k)
publication status (journal, unpublished manuscript, thesis or dissertation, book chapter, or conference presentation); (1) amount of physical
effort and energy needed to perform the behavior (low, as with seat belt
use; moderate, as with participating in organized demonstrations; or
high, as with aerobic exercise); and (m) whether or not there was a
physiological component associated with the target behavior that would
plausibly enhance or inhibit its occurrence (e.g., the nicotine ingested
from cigarettes would enhance the likelihood of smoking and inhibit the
likelihood of quitting). The coding of studies was completed prior to
calculating study outcomes. Interrater agreement on each of these dimensions ranged from 81% to 100%, and disagreements were resolved by
discussion. 4
No interpretable effects were obtained for the following variables:
percentage of females in sample, year of study, and publication status
of study. Furthermore, too few studies assessed behaviors with a likely
physiological component to evaluate the effects of this variable. Finally,
the effect of amount of effort to perform the behavior was not especially
meaningful; past behavior had weaker relations to intention and to future
behavior when behavior performance required moderate effort than when
performance required little effort or considerable effort. These predictors
are not discussed further.

4 Study characteristics were coded by Judith A. Ouellette and an undergraduate student uninformed of the purposes of the study. To ensure
accuracy of the coding for opportunity for performance and context
stability, these two study attributes were receded by two students, both
blind to the study hypotheses. The two new coders agreed on 86% of
their judgments. Furthermore, their agreement levels with the original
coding were 77% and 85% for each coder, respectively, All disagreements
were resolved through discussion.

Computation of Effect Sizes
Effect size estimates were calculated as bivariate correlations (rs) for
those studies that furnished sufficient information. We (the authors)
worked independently to calculate effect size estimates for the relations
between the following variable pairs: past behavior-intention, past behavior-future behavior, past behavior-attitude, past behavior-perceived control, past behavior-subjective norm, attitude-intention, attitude-future behavior, attitude-subject norm, attitude-perceived control, perceived control-intention, perceived control-future behavior,
perceived control-subjective norm, subjective norm-intention, subjective norm-future behavior, and intention-future behavior.
Because most of the studies we reviewed were designed to test aspects
of rational models of behavior prediction (i.e., Ajzen's [1991] theory
of planned behavior; Fishbein & Ajzen's [1975] theory of reasoned
action; Triandis's [1977] model of interpersonal behavior), the studies
used common operations of these variables. The typical measure of
attitude was attitude toward the behavior. Participants in the studies
rated the extent to which engaging in the target behavior was good or
bad (or other characteristics) on adjective rating scales. For the typical
measure of subjective norm, participants were asked whether important
others think participants should perform the target behavior and then
whether the participants were motivated to comply with these others.
The final norm measure was the product of these rated normative beliefs
and motivation to comply. The typical measure of perceived behavioral
control assessed how easy or difficult it was for participants to perform
the target behavior. The typical measure of intention assessed whether
participants intended or planned to perform the target behavior in a
given period of time.
Interrater agreement was acceptable (r = .90), and disagreements
were resolved through discussion. When more than one correlation was
given for any pair of variables within the same study, these correlations
were converted to Fisher's zs and were aggregated to yield a mean z,
which represented the single effect size estimate for that study.
For the analyses, rs were converted to Fisher's zs, and each estimate
was weighted by the inverse of its variance (i.e., N - 3). In this procedure, estimates with smaller variance, which are more precisely estimated, receive greater weight. A weighted mean z was then calculated
across the set of study outcomes (Hedges & Olkin, 1985).
Significance tests for comparisons between independent effect sizes
(i.e., r statistics converted to zs) used the following formula for contrasts
(Rosenthal, 1991; Snedecor & Cochran, 1967): z ~ ...... = (z~ - z2)/
[1/(N~ - 3) + I/(N2 - 3)] m, in which N1 and Nz represent the total
aggregated number of participants in each of the two groups of studies.
When reporting the results, we converted the weighted mean zs back
to rs. The number of studies aggregated in the effect (and not the number
of participants, which was used in tests of statistical significance) is
noted in parentheses.
Results

Characteristics of the Typical Study
The modal study that provided effects assessed past behavior
within a given time frame, ranging from 2 weeks up to 12
months. Past behavior was typically measured with a single
questionnaire item such as " H o w often have you performed
[the target behavior[ in the past [time f r a m e ] ? " The scale
anchors typically specified frequency of performance; for example, for the time frame of 2 weeks, anchors ranged from never
to every day. The modal study also predicted both behavioral
intentions and behaviors, and it featured one item to assess each
of these. Intentions were typically assessed at the same time as
past behavior, attitude, and other predictors. That is, for 94% of

the studies, these predictors were assessed at the same time.
Future behavior was assessed an average of either 7 or 14 days
after these other predictors. The participant sample of the typical
study was 17-25 years old and was 50% or more females. The
modal study was published in a journal and had a completion
date in 1991.

Bivariate Correlations Among Past Behavior, Future
Behavior, and Other Predictors
We initially estimated the correlations among measures across
the whole sample of studies. As shown in Table 1, past behavior
was significantly related to behavioral intentions, r = .43, p <
.001 (study outcomes, n = 33) and to future behavior, r = .39,
p < .001 (study outcomes, n -- 16). In addition, significant
relations emerged between past behavior and the other predictors
such that more frequent behavior was associated with more
favorable attitudes, less perceived difficulty in controlling the
act, and slightly stronger normative pressure to engage in the
act.
Consistent with the theory of planned behavior and the theory
of reasoned action (Ajzen, 1987; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), the
other predictors were significantly related to behavioral intention and to future behavior such that more favorable attitudes,
stronger normative pressure, and less perceived difficulty of control were associated with stronger intentions and greater likelihood of future behavior (see Table 1). As would be expected
given that attitudes, norms, and control directly affect intentions
and that intentions affect behavior, correlations with intentions
tended to be larger than with behavior. In general, the findings
in our relatively restricted review, which included only those
studies that assessed both attitudes and past behavior, are comparable with estimates of prior reviews that were designed to
evaluate broader literature (e.g., Kraus, 1995; Sheppard, Hartwick, & Warshaw, 1988; van den Putte, 1993).
Homogeneity tests were conducted to determine whether it
was indeed appropriate to aggregate the studies testing each
relationship. The homogeneity statistic, Q, has a chi-square distribution with k - 1 degrees of freedom, in which k represents
the number of estimates (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). A significant
result suggests rejection of the hypothesis that the effects are
drawn from a common population. As can be seen in Table 1,
this statistic was significant for all of the relations estimated
except for the perceived control-future behavior effect. It may
thus be inappropriate to interpret the estimates for which the
test was significant, and it is advisable to conduct moderator
analyses to explain the variability across estimates.

Past Behavior Predicts Future Behavior Controlling for
Other Predictors
A number of the reviewed studies used multiple regression
designs in which intentions, attitudes, past behavior, subjective
norms, perceived behavioral control, and a variety of other variables (e.g., age of participants) predicted behavior. Although
these models could not be used to calculate exact effect size
estimates, they did provide information on the number of instances in which the past-behavior regression coefficient sig-

nificantly predicted future behavior after controlling for these
other potential predictors.
Counting analyses identified the number of studies in which
past behavior effects were significant in regression models that
controlled for other predictors (Hedges & Olkin, 1985).5 O f the
13 studies that reported regression models predicting future
behavior from intention and past behavior, 11 revealed that past
behavior was a statistically significant predictor of future behavior. The estimated size of the relation between past behavior
and intention, based on these frequencies (Bushman, 1994;
Hedges & Olkin, 1985), is r = .21, 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 0.14/0.29. Several of these studies included other predictors in addition to intention: In six of six studies, past behavior was significant after controlling for perceived control and
intention, which yielded an effect size of r = .88. In four of
four studies, past behavior was significant after controlling for
attitude, subjective norm, and intention, which yielded an effect
size of r = .85. 6 Although only four studies were available for
this critical control analysis (i.e., the examination of the effects
of past behavior independent of attitude), these four estimates
reflect the data from a total of 1,265 participants. Thus, past
behavior emerged as a significant predictor of future behavior,
independent of intentions, attitudes, norms, and control. Consequently, past-behavior effects can be interpreted independently
of these other variables.

Prediction of Future Behavior From Past Behavior
Depends on Opportunity for Performance and Stability
of Context
The opportunity for performing a behavior and the stability
of the context in which it was performed proved to be highly

correlated, Kendal's 7- = .76, such that behaviors with higher
opportunity for performance also were more likely to be performed in stable contexts. Given the substantial overlap in coders' ratings of these dimensions, we combined the factors into
a single dichotomous index. The first group of studies included
behavioral domains that people do not confront very often in
daily life and that involve relatively unstable contexts, in which
features that maintain the behavior are shifting or are difficult
to negotiate. Initiation and performance of acts with these attributes should require some deliberation and control. Consequently, future behavior should be a function of conscious intentions to act, and any effects of past behavior will most likely
be indirect, through behavioral intents. The second group of
studies included behavioral domains that are encountered more
often and that provide a relatively stable context supporting
behavior. Such acts are conducive to the development of habitual
tendencies to respond. Under these conditions, frequent performance can establish strong habits that yield relatively automatic
repetition of past behavior, and past behavior should directly
guide future behavior. We did not include in the analysis the
5 For three of the studies predicting behavior, the analyses were reported separately for two different behavioral domains. In these studies,
after controlling for intention, past behavior emerged as a significant
predictor in one behavioral domain but not in the other. Because' we
could not identify a single study outcome that aggregated across the
behavioral domains within these studies, they were not included in the
counting analyses.
6 When all studies yield the same outcome in a vote-counting analysis,
effect size estimates can be derived by a Bayesian approach to estimating
the population correlation (Bushman, 1994; Hedges & Olkin, 1985).
No CIs are available for these estimates.

few study outcomes in which opportunity for performance and
context had disparate codes (i.e., high opportunity in low-stability contexts or low opportunity in high-stability contexts).7
Consistent with these expectations, frequency of past behavior was a weaker predictor of future behavior in domains that
are encountered only annually or biannually and that present
unstable contexts, r = .27, p < .001, than in domains encountered on a daily or weekly basis and that present stable contexts,
r = .59, p < .001; Z d i f f . . . .
=
8.98, p < .001 (see Table 2).
Also as anticipated, intentions and attitudes had uniform effects
in the prediction of future behavior; their impact was not modified by performance opportunity and context stability. We had
anticipated that subjective norms would function like attitudes
and be relatively insensitive to the study groupings. However,
norms proved to be a stronger predictor for behaviors performed
annually or biannually in changing contexts than for behaviors
performed daily or weekly in stable settings, zoiffe..... = 3.61,
p < .001. Too little data were available concerning perceived
behavioral control to evaluate the effects of this predictor.
A number of other effect size estimates varied with performance opportunity and context stability. In general, conscious,
rational predictors of intentions demonstrated stronger relations
for behaviors performed annually or biannually in changing contexts than behaviors performed daily or weekly in stable contexts. Thus, attitudes had a stronger impact on intentions in
domains that encouraged deliberatively guided behavior, r =
.51, p < .001, than in domains that supported habits, r = .44,
p < .001; zdief. . . . = 3.23, p < .001. Similarly, subjective norms
had stronger impact in domains that encouraged deliberatively
guided behavior, r -- .39, p < .001, than in domains that supported habits, r = .16, p < .001; z~irf...... = 8.30, p < .001.

Although we had not predicted this pattern, it suggests that,
when people are consciously deliberating about acts, they form
intentions in a careful, thoughtful manner that considers evaluations of the outcomes of the behavior (i.e., attitudes) and others'
preferences (i.e., norms). In domains conducive to habit formation, people may base intentions on less ambiguous, perhaps
more easily determined cues such as past act frequency. Indeed,
past behavior was a stronger predictor of intentions in domains
that supported habit formation, r = .60, p < .001, than in
domains that encouraged deliberative thought, r = .32, p <
.001; Zdiff. . . . . = 11.77, p < .001.

Does Past Behavior Directly Predict Intention?
A secondary focus of the present investigation was to examine
whether past behavior directly predicts intention or whether it
contributes to attitudes or to perceived control and only indirectly predicts intents. We evaluated whether past behavior predicts intention independent of these other factors. Counting analyses identified the number of studies in which past behavior
emerged as a significant predictor of intentions in regression
models that controlled for other predictors. In 19 of 22 studies,
past behavior was a significant predictor in the regression models after controlling for both attitudes and subjective norm. The
estimated size of the relation between past behavior and intention, based on these frequencies (Bushman, 1994; Hedges &
Olkin, 1985), is r = .25, 95%, CI = 0.18/0.30. In 8 of the 9

7 The number of study outcomes that were excluded varied across
analyses, with the modal number being 4.

<-----Page 9----->PAST BEHAVIOR PREDICTS FUTURE BEHAVIOR
studies that also controlled for perceived control, past behavior
emerged as a significant predictor, yielding an effect size estimate of r = .28, 95% CI = 0.16/0.38. It appears, then, that
frequency of past behavior directly predicts intentions. It may
still be the case that past behavior contributes to attitudes,
norms, and control, but past behavior has direct effects on intentions independent of these other predictors.

Modeling Joint Effects of Past Behavior and Intention
on Future Behavior
As we had anticipated, both intentions and past behavior
predicted future behavior. The direct effects of past behavior
were most pronounced in domains supportive of routinized response repetition, although the effects of intentions on future
behavior proved constant across domains. We claim that, in
domains supportive of habits, past behavior has direct effects
on future responses, unmediated by thoughts and perceptions,
which are represented by intentions (and the attitudes, norms,
and perceived control on which intentions are based). However,
when behavior requires deliberative thought, past behavior contributes to intentions and affects future performance primarily
through the mediation of intentions. These ideas cannot be evaluated from bivariate correlations among the variables; to do so
requires simultaneous assessment of the effects of past behavior
and intentions on future behavior. Thus, we used the bivariate
correlations to estimate path models from the synthesized data.
The path analyses were conducted with generalized least
squares (GLS) regression (see Becker, 1992; Becker & Schram,
1994). The first step in this analysis involved estimating a
pooled correlation matrix of the relations among past behavior,
intention, and future behavior. First, a matrix was constructed
to represent the zero-order relations among the variables for
each of the 15 studies that provided sufficient data. These matrixes were used to calculate variance-covariance matrixes for
each study. Using GLS formulas (provided by Becker, 1992),
and the matrix utility SAS PROC IML (1989), we aggregated
the variance-covariance matrixes and estimated a single pooled
correlation matrix and standard errors. Homogeneity tests were
conducted to determine whether the single correlation matrix
could adequately describe all of the sample results. The homogeneity statistic, QE, has a chi-square distribution with (k - 1)p
degrees of freedom, in which k represents the number of independent studies being combined and p represents the number of
correlations drawn from each study (see Becker & Schram,
1994). This test of fit indicated significance, QE(39, N = 14)
= 971.82, p < .001, suggesting that all study results do not
share a common population value and that additional predictors
are necessary to adequately account for the effects.
The studies were then grouped into two sets. One reflected
domains conducive to habits, domains in which people have the
opportunity to perform behaviors daily or weekly and the context is stable (study outcomes, n = 8). These included exercise,
eating at fast food restaurants, class attendance, seat belt use,
drinking milk, and church attendance. The other set included
domains that require deliberation and control, in which behaviors can be performed only annually or biannually and the supporting context is unstable (study outcomes, n = 6). These
included blood donation, voting, obtaining a flu shot, and ob-

63

taining a mammogram. Separate pooled correlation matrixes
and their standard errors were calculated for each group (see
Table 3). Homogeneity tests conducted separately on the two
groups proved to be significant, QE(21, N = 8) = 145.72 for
high-opportunity, high-stability domains and QE( 15, N = 6) =
518.13 for low-opportunity, low-stability groups, ps < .001.
This variability is not surprising given our rather global distinction between these two types of domains. Some of the behavioral
domains classified as providing high opportunity for performance and stable contexts likely supported greater automaticity
in behavioral repetition than did others in this category. Similarly, not all of the domains classified as having low-opportunity,
unstable contexts impeded habits and required thoughtful deliberation to the same extent.
In the next step in the analysis, we estimated a standardized
regression equation predicting future behavior from past behavior and intentions with the data from the two sets of pooled
matrixes (see Table 4). As can be seen in Figure 1 (Panel
A), the path model for acts typically performed annually or
biannually in unstable contexts revealed that both intentions and
past behavior were significant predictors of future behavior (ps
< .001). As anticipated, however, past behavior effects were
small, and intentions were a significantly stronger predictor, z
= 17.15, p < .001 (see Becker & Schram, 1994, p. 371, for
the test of the difference between regression coefficients). Thus,
in these behavioral domains, consciously formed intentions predicted future behavior directly. Past behavior had a relatively
minimal direct impact on future responses. The path model for
behavior performed on a daily or weekly basis in constant contexts again revealed that both intentions and past behavior were
significant predictors (ps < .001 ). However, as predicted, past
behavior had a strong direct impact. Its effect was significantly
larger than that of intention, z = 2.82, p < .001 (see Figure 1,
Panel B ). Thus, in domains conducive to habit formation, people
tended to directly repeat past acts, presumably because frequently performed behaviors were automatically cued by the
stable environment. In these domains, conscious intentions had
a less marked impact on future responses.
We also considered how the impact of past behavior on future
behavior varied across domains. Comparison between the pastbehavior regression coefficients in the two study groupings (Co-

variability in the past-behavior measure would inflate the apparent predictive power of other factors and could explain why
intention had a relatively strong effect in this study grouping.
However, problems with reliability or variability in a measure
should attenuate all relations between that variable and other
factors. As can be seen in Table 5, which reports the bivariate
correlations for studies included in the path analysis, past behavior was actually more strongly related to subjective norms in
domains conducive to habit formation than in domains not supportive of habits. Although this particular effect is not theoretically meaningful, it does suggest that reliability and variability
of the behavior measures did not vary importantly across our
study groupings.
Finally, the differential effects of intention in the two domains
were not due to the way intention was measured. In both
domains, approximately two thirds of the studies assessed behavioral intentions, and only a third assessed behavioral
expectations.

A

Methodological Artifacts
A number of measurement factors could inflate or attenuate
the behavior-behavior relationship; such factors include the
time interval between measures, specificity of the behavioral
criterion and the variance of the measure, and similarity between
the two measures of behavior (Sutton, 1994). It could be argued
that these account for the path analytic results. For example, in
domains not conducive to habits, the link between past and
future behaviors might be suppressed due to such measurement
artifacts, and the apparent effects of intentions would then be
enhanced because of the lesser predictive ability of past
behavior.
First, we considered whether the time span between measures
could explain the path analytic findings. For all of the studies
included in the path analysis, the intention and the past behavior
measures were obtained at the same time and in the same reporting context (i.e., with the exception of a single study in the
domains conducive to habit formation, this study assessed past
behavior 2 weeks prior to assessing intention). Thus, the results
were not due to differential timing of intention and past-behavior
measures. Furthermore, for domains supportive of habits, the
mean delay between assessments of intention and future behavior was 49.67 days, and the mean delay between assessments
of past and future behaviors was 55.83 days. For domains not
conducive to habits, the mean delay for both intentions and past
behavior was 79.75 days. Given that greater delay should be
associated with less predictive power of intentions and of past
behavior, delay could not have accounted for the differential
impact of intention and past behavior within each study
grouping.
Second, our findings do not appear to be due to problems with
the reliability or the variability of the past-behavior measure in
domains not conducive to habits. Low reliability or minimal

Note. n = number of studies aggregated in the effect. Correlations above the diagonal are for highopportunity, high-stability contexts, and correlations below the diagonal are for low-opportunity, low-stability
contexts. All correlations with attitudes and subjective norms are simple aggregated bivariate correlations.
Correlations in boldface are bivariate correlations obtained by pooling the variance-covariance matrixes
of the individual studies; this aggregation method was used for the data entered into the path analyses.

Methodological Moderators
We expected past behavior to be more closely related to measures of intention that were phrased in terms of expectancies
for future performance than to measures that specified conscious
plans to complete the act. Indeed, past behavior proved to be
a better predictor of behavioral expectations, r = .45 (study
outcomes, n = 13), than of behavioral intentions, r = .40 (study
outcomes, n = 19); z0iff..... = 3.02, p < .01. Thus, past behavior
was more strongly related to intentions that reflected the simple
likelihood of the act in the future than to intentions that reflected
decisions to act.
We also examined whether the relation between past behavior
and intention depended on the order in which the variables were
measured in the reviewed studies. If intentions and past behavior
are related because intentions are in part likelihood judgments
based on past incidence, then the relation between these variables should be stronger when past behavior is assessed prior
to intentions--thus, past action (or inaction) would be highly
s a l i e n t - - t h a n when past behavior is assessed following intentions. Indeed, past behavior proved to be a better predictor of
intention when it was assessed first, r = .64 (study outcomes,
n = 5), than when intention was assessed first, r = .41 (study
outcomes, n = 28); Zdife...... = 8.41, p < .001.
The number of items used in the questionnaires also emerged
as a moderator in our review. Past-behavior measures composed
of more than one item were marginally more successful at predicting future behavior, r = ,45 (study outcomes, n = 6), than
measures composed of a single item, r = .38 (study outcomes,
n = 1 0 ) , p < .07, for the comparison between different numbers
of items. Similarly, greater success in predicting intentions was
observed when the past-behavior measure was composed of
more than one item, r = .63 (study outcomes, n = 10), than
when composed of a single item, r = .39 (study outcomes, n
= 22), p < .001, for the comparison. Thus, studies that obtained
more reliable measures generated stronger effects.

Discussion
Past behavior emerged as an important predictor of future
behavior in the studies in our review. Overall, when the findings
were aggregated across the full set of studies, the magnitude of
the effect of past behavior on future behavior, r = .39, p <
.001, was about comparable with that of other predictors. That
is, the impact of frequency of past behavior was slightly weaker
than that of intentions, r = .54, approximately the same size as
the effect of attitudes, r = .33, and slightly stronger than the
effects of behavioral control (i.e., difficulty of performance), r
= - . 2 1 , and of subjective norms, r = .23.
The findings also provide good support for our theoretical
analysis of the multiple mechanisms through which past behavior can affect future responses. Past behavior directly contributes to future performance in contexts that support the development of habits. Behaviors that are well practiced and performed
in stable contexts are likely to be repeated because they can be
performed quickly, relatively effortlessly, in parallel with other
activities, and with minimal or sporadic attention (Bargh, 1989;
Logan, 1989). Conscious deliberation and decision making are
not required for performance of such acts. Although habitual
behaviors may be intentional and goal directed, the controlling
intentions are not typically accessible to consciousness, because
with repeated performance (a) intentions themselves tend to
become automatic; (b) intentions tend to be specified in an
efficient, stable, and general form that emphasizes the goals met
by the action rather than action details; and (c) intentions, much
like the actions they direct, tend to be combined into broader
and more efficient units that refer to sets of behaviors that occur
together rather than to individual actions.
In our review, behavioral domains conducive to habit formation were defined as those in which behaviors could be performed on a daily or weekly basis in a stable, predictable supporting context. These included alcohol and coffee consumption, most types of exercise, seat belt use, and class and church

<-----Page 12----->66

attendance. A path model that estimated future performance of
these behaviors from past-behavior frequency and behavioral
intentions revealed a strong direct effect of past behavior on
future responses. Thus, for these types of behaviors, it appears
that frequent past performance reflects habits that automatically
guide future responses. Intentions had a much smaller effect in
these domains but remained a significant predictor of future
behavior.
We further anticipated that past behavior would have a minimal direct effect on future responses when people consciously
deliberate about actions. Conscious deliberation and decision
making likely are required to initiate and execute novel behaviors and behaviors that are performed in difficult or changing
contexts. In these domains, past-behavior frequency is one factor
that might inform participants' judgments of intention. In the
present review, we anticipated that conscious deliberation would
be required in domains that (a) provided minimal opportunity
for performance, in which behaviors occurred only annually or
biannually and (b) presented unstable, shifting contexts that did
not provide a constant set of cues supporting behavior performance. In the present review, behaviors classified as low in
opportunity for performance and low in stability of supporting
context included voting, preventative health behaviors (e.g., getting a flu shot or a mammogram), blood donation, and exercise
after childbirth or after experiencing a heart attack. In the path
model estimating future performance of these behaviors based
on past behavior frequency and behavioral intentions, conscious
intentions emerged as a strong predictor. Past-act frequency had
a small although statistically significant effect on future responses. It seems that when behavior is a function of conscious
decision making and deliberation, intentions directly predict behavior performance, and the effects of past behavior are likely
to be mediated through conscious intents. Indeed, the correlation
between intention and past behavior in this context (r = .40)
implies that intentions were drawn from incidence of past behavior, with people reasoning that they performed (or did not
perform) a behavior in the past and would continue to do so
(or not) in the future.
Deliberations about future behavior likely include more than
just past behavior. According to Ajzen's (1987) theory of
planned behavior, intentions reflect attitudes toward the act,
subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The bivariate correlation analyses were consistent with the idea that behavioral intentions reflect these other factors, especially in behavioral domains that people encounter rarely or that entail changing contexts. That is, attitudes and subjective norms had
especially strong effects on intentions in such contexts. This
coherence among intentions, attitudes, and norms is consistent
with the idea that people are deliberately reasoning about their
behavior in such domains. Reasoning how to act in these domains is likely to render evaluative beliefs, normative beliefs,
and behavioral intents relatively consistent.
It is interesting that, contrary to the pattern that emerged with
attitudes and subjective norms as predictors of intention, past
behavior was more closely related to intention in domains in
which automatic, habitual tendencies were likely to develop
rather than in domains requiring conscious decision making.
Although we did not specifically anticipate this result, it is
consistent with the idea that, when people are asked to give

conscious intentions for habitual behaviors, they do not generate
especially thoughtful responses based on their evaluations and
subjective norms. Instead, people may rely on salient, tangible
instances of past behavior, which should be especially accessible
in domains with high opportunity for performance.
In general, intention and past behavior appeared to alternate
as predictors of future acts. In domains that facilitated development and execution of habits, past behavior was a strong predictor and intention relatively weak. In domains that did not
facilitate habits, past behavior was a relatively weak direct predictor and intention was quite strong. One interpretation of this
pattern is that intention effects emerge primarily in the absence
of habit. We suspect that the relation between intention and
habit is actually more complex than suggested by such a broad
generalization, which does not allow for such phenomena as
New Year's resolutions, in which strongly held intentions can,
at least temporarily, override the effects of habit.

Interpreting Past Behavior Effects
Interpreting the effects of past behavior on future acts has
been difficult because past behavior is itself a product of a
variety of psychological states. In the meta-analytic synthesis,
we were able to eliminate several of the most obvious confounds. The counting analyses revealed that past behavior independently predicted future behavior in studies that had conducted analyses controlling for the effects of intentions, attitudes
toward the act, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Thus, the effects of past behavior cannot be attributed to
these potential confounds.
However, the correlational nature of these data leaves open
the possibility that some additional unmeasured factor is confounded with past behavior frequency and is actually responsible
for the obtained pattern. Two explanations in particular merit
comment. Given that direct experience with an attitude object
yields attitudes (and perhaps intentions) that are held more
strongly and with greater certainty (Fazio, Chen, McDonel, &
Sherman, 1982; Petty & Krosnick, 1995), it could be that frequent past behavior increases the strength of attitudes. One index
of strength is the ease with which attitudes can be accessed
from memory (Fazio, 1990), and it may be that past behavior
serves as a proxy for attitude accessibility.
In addition, past behavior could be confounded with beliefs
about the self. It could be that people who report that they have
engaged in a behavior frequently in the past have a corresponding self-concept, and it is this self-view that guides future performance. Given the way that past behavior was measured in the
reviewed studies, however, we do not find the self-concept account especially compelling. Participants in most of the studies
were asked to give subjective estimates of the frequency with
which they performed the target behavior. Thus, respondents
who donated blood twice a year would rate on the scale that
they were "frequent" blood donors much like people who drank
coffee daily would rate that they were "frequent" coffee drinkers. It seems likely then that people who reported frequent performance in these two domains considered themselves regular
blood donors and coffee drinkers, although past-behavior effects
emerged primarily with coffee-drinking type behaviors (i.e.,
when opportunity and stability were high).

<-----Page 13----->PAST BEHAVIOR PREDICTS FUTURE BEHAVIOR
Unfortunately, the information necessary to evaluate empirically these alternate interpretations of past behavior effects was
not provided in the reviewed studies. However, primary research
data that address these issues are available. As part of her dissertation research, Ouellette (1996) investigated the role of behavior frequency, context stability, attitude accessibility, and selfconcept in predicting future behavior.

Ouellette's (1996) Investigation of Past Behavior
Effects on Future Behavior
In one part of this research, 141 Texas A&M University undergraduate students completed a two-part experiment concerning
their TV watching and their recycling behavior. In the first session, they completed a series of questionnaire measures, evaluating (a) frequency of past behavior (assessed from estimates of
the number of times, for each of the previous 6 months, that
participants had engaged in the behavior), (b) subjective norm
(rated on a 9-point scale evaluating whether "people whose
opinions are important to me think that it is good if I watch
TV/recycle" ranging from 1 [strongly disagree[ to 9 [strongly
agree]), (c) perceived behavioral control (rated on a 9-point
scale ranging from 1 [very easy] to 9 [very difficult]), (d)
intention to perform the act (rated on a 9-point scale ranging
from 1 [very unlikely] to 9 [very likely]), (e) self-concept
measures of whether participants thought of themselves as regular TV watchers or regular recyclers (on a 10-point scale ranging
from 1 [absolutely false] to 9 [absolutely true]), ( f ) an assessment of attitudes that yielded favorability (across six 9-point
semantic differential scales for each behavior), and (g) a computerized assessment of attitude accessibility (i.e., response latency to rate the attitude on the scales; see Fazio, 1990).
TV watching and recycling would have been classified as
high-opportunity behaviors in the meta-analytic synthesis, because people can perform these behaviors on a daily or weekly
basis. However, even with frequent performance in a domain,
behaviors are likely to be repeated automatically only when they
occur in stable, predictable contexts. To assess stability of the
supporting context, participants completed an open response

67

measure in which they listed what they would always do (if
anything) before watching TV and before recycling. The number
of factors listed were counted and, on the basis of this measure,
two groups of participants were selected. One group was composed of those who did not list any consistent antecedents to
performing the behavior (ns = 39 and 90 for watching TV and
recycling, respectively) and those who listed at least two stable
antecedents (ns = 33 and 9, for TV and recycling, respectively).
It is interesting to note that frequency of past behavior was
correlated with the number of antecedents listed only for one
of the behaviors (rs = - . 0 3 , ns, and .35, p < .01, for watching
TV and recycling, respectively).
Three weeks later, participants were recontacted for an (ostensibly unrelated) telephone survey in which they reported the
frequency with which they had watched TV and recycled during
the period since the first assessment. The correlations among
measures for each behavior are given in Table 6.
We anticipated that the results of this study would parallel
those obtained in the meta-analytic synthesis. That is, in regression models predicting future behavior, frequency of past behavior should interact with context stability. In stable contexts, past
behavior should be a strong, direct predictor, whereas in unstable
contexts past-behavior effects should be mediated by intention,
and intention should be the primary predictor of future acts.
Furthermore, we expected these patterns to obtain even when
other potential predictors of behavior were entered into the regression models (i.e., self-concept and attitude accessibility).
We first constructed regression models to replicate the path
analysis in the meta-analytic synthesis. Frequency of future behavior was predicted from frequency of past behavior, intention,
context, the interaction between past behavior and context, and
the interaction between intention and context. The results were
essentially identical across watching TV and recycling and well
replicated the meta-analytic findings: In the overall models, the
main effects for intention were significant (unstandardized bs
= 2.14 and 0.80), t(68) = 3.09 and t(97) = 4.47, p s < .01,
for TV and recycling, respectively, and the interactions between
past behavior and context approached significance (bs = 0.31

and 0.63), t(68) = 1.83 and t(97) = 3.34, p s < .07, for
TV and recycling. More important, when the simple regression
slopes within context were calculated for each behavior (see
Aiken & West, 1991), only frequency of past behavior was a
predictor in stable contexts (bs = 0.39 and 0.52), t(31) = 2.25
and t ( 6 ) = 7.06, p s < .05 for TV and recycling, respectively,
and only intention was a strong predictor in unstable contexts
(bs -= 2.14 and 0.80), t(37) = 3.85 and t(91) = 4.37, p s <
.001, for TV and recycling, respectively. As in the meta-analytic
synthesis, for behaviors that are performed in stable contexts,
frequent past behavior reflects habitual tendencies and directly
determines future behavior. Conscious intentions had little effect, t(31) = 1.49 and t ( 6 ) = 0.07, ns, for TV and recycling,
respectively. For behaviors that are performed in unstable contexts for which there are no established antecedents, frequent
past performance does not reflect habits; the effects of past
behavior are then mediated by conscious intentions, and only
intention is a direct predictor of future behavior. Past behavior
was not significant, t(37) = 1.26 and t(91) = - 0 . 8 2 , ns.
Regression models also were calculated to examine the effects of intention and past behavior in conjunction with attitude
accessibility and self-concept. We anticipated that the effects
of accessibility and self-concept would be similar to those of
intention in these models. That is, automatic repetition of frequently performed behavior in stable contexts should emerge
after controlling for the effects of accessibility and self-concept.
Furthermore, because accessibility and self-concept reflect many
factors in addition to frequency of past behavior, we anticipated
that these factors would independently predict future behavior.
Bivariate correlations between the variables in the model, which
were calculated separately for high- and low-stability contexts,
are presented in Tables 7 and 8. The regression models are
presented in Tables 9 and 10. Given the large number of predictors and the relatively small sample size, we were unable to
include in the models any interactions but the two-way interactions between past behavior and other factors (see design in
Tables 9 and 10). Essentially, the findings again replicated the
meta-analytic results and suggested that past behavior had
unique effects on future behavior. That is, the Past Behavior x

Context interactions were significant in the overall models in
both behavioral domains. Furthermore, in the simple effects
decomposition within context, past behavior was a significant
predictor within stable but not unstable contexts. Also as predicted, conscious judgments, self-concept and intention in particular, were significant predictors in unstable but not stable
contexts. In unstable contexts, future TV watching behavior was
a function of conscious inferences about the self, and frequency
of recycling was a function of conscious intentions, s Attitude
accessibility, however, had no effect in any context, and including this term did not weaken the predictive power of past
behavior.
These findings provide strong support for our theorizing about
the conditions under which past behavior directly affects future
performance and when it has an indirect effect, mediated
through intention. The results also demonstrate that past-behavior effects are not confounded with attitude accessibility or with
the self-concept and, in support of the meta-analytic findings,
that past-behavior effects are not confounded with intentions,
attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived control.

8 We also computed these analyses substituting the components of
behavioral intention (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) for the intention predictor, and the results were largely
consistent with those reported in the text. The overall models predicted
future behavior from attitude, subjective norm, past behavior, context,
perceived control, attitude accessibility, self-concept, and the two-way
interactions among context and past behavior, attitude, subjective norm,
accessibility, perceived control, and self-concept. For recycling, significant relations included subjective norm, perceived control, and Past
Behavior X Context (ps < .05). For watching TV, significant relations
included self-concept, Past Behavior X Context, and Self-Concept ×
Context (ps < .05). As with the models reported in the text, we then
computed simple effects analyses examining the predictors within levels
of context. For recycling, subjective norm and perceived control predicted future behavior (p s < .05) in unstable contexts, and only past
behavior approached significance, t(3) = 2.36, p < .15 (all other ts <
1 ) in stable contexts. For watching TV, only self-concept predicted future
behavior (p < .001 ) in unstable contexts, and only past behavior was
a significant predictor (p < .05) in stable contexts.

often they engage in a target behavior and whether they do so
" b y force of habit" or "without awareness" (e.g., Mittal, 1988;
Towler & Shepherd, 1992; Wittenbraker, Gibbs, & Kahle, 1983).
We are skeptical, however, that people can accurately answer
questions that require them to distinguish between behaviors
that are generated through automatic mechanisms and behaviors
that reflect conscious decision making. Alternately, Verplanken,
Aarts, van Knippenberg, and van Knippenberg (1994) assessed
transportation habits from people's estimates of how they would
perform everyday trips mentioned in a series of scenarios (e.g.,
going to the supermarket). Although this measure proved to be
moderately correlated with the standard assessment of past act
frequency (rs ranged from .31 to .42), it yielded unique effects
on information acquisition that were not demonstrated by the
past-behavior measure. Thus, scenario estimates appear to have
information-processing implications that are not found with estimates of frequency of past behavior. It may be that these reflect
behavioral scripts (Schank & Abelson, 1977) as well as habit.
At least in contexts conducive to habit formation and performance, then, past behavior may be the best indicator of habit
strength.
The validity of past behavior as an indicator of habit depends
importantly on how accurately people can report on their past
acts. Reports of act frequency are likely to be more accurate
with rating scales that assess numbers of acts than with scales
that use adjectives to reflect frequency (e.g., often, sometimes,
rarely). Adjective estimates are ambiguous, and their meaning
varies with a given behavioral domain. In domains with low
rates of occurrence in daily life, such as donating blood, respondents could claim frequent performance with only two or three
instances of the behavior in a year. Alternately, in domains with
high rates of occurrence, such as drinking coffee, respondents
could claim seldom or infrequent performance for engaging in
the behavior once a week. In addition, rating scales that tap
respondents' estimates of the rate at which they perform a behavior, such as the typical number of times per week one eats
breakfast, are often easier to complete and may be more accurate
than scales that encourage enumeration of specific instances,
such as recalling each instance of breakfast in the past 2 weeks
(Blair & Burton, 1987; Menon, 1993). Because respondents
will have forgotten many specific instances, enumeration can
lead to underreports of behavior frequency. Accuracy of behavioral reports also depends on the inference rules that respondents
use to generalize from their recall of specific episodes or occurrence rates (Schwarz, 1990). Questions that emphasize the use
of accurate rules (e.g., raising the possibility of changes in
frequency of performance across the estimation period) are most
likely to yield valid estimates of past behavior.
Further precision in the measurement of habit may be gained
by considering the goals that have motivated past behavior. For
example, Aarts and Dijksterhuis (1997) activated a number of
everyday transportation goals (e.g., going shopping) for people
who in the past had frequently used a bicycle to meet those
goals. These people easily and quickly decided what mode of
transportation to use when presented with relevant situational
cues (e.g., grocery store). However, when the transportation
goals were not made salient, people's responses were no faster
to the situational cues than responses of people who did not
have a habit of bicycle use. It seems, then, that cognitive repre-

sentations of the links between behavior and context were activated only with relevant goals. Especially for behaviors that can
serve multiple goals, it may be useful in future work to assess
habits while the particular goal that has directed past behavior
is salient (see also Aarts, Paulussen, & Schaalma, 1997).
Conclusion
The present review was designed to integrate habit into contemporary approaches to the prediction of social behavior by
demonstrating its empirical independence from other predictors
and by explaining how its impact derives from the cognitive
processes and goal specification associated with well-practiced
behaviors in constant contexts.
Theoretical understanding of habits has practical use; it enables social scientists to devise more effective strategies to help
people initiate new behavior and change existing behavior. Altering frequently performed behavior in constant contexts requires
conscious decision making to devise and implement new responses and to suppress or divert any well-practiced behavior
that might be cued by the environment (e.g., sidetracking; see
Guthrie, 1935; James, 1890). Specifically, effective change strategies are likely to include the formulation of explicit plans to
initiate and implement a new behavior (Gollwitzer, 1996). If
the new behavior then accomplishes one's current goals without
impeding other valued outcomes, conscious intentions to initiate
and perform the new response are likely to remain strong.
A potential point of failure in implementing behavior change
decisions arises when the behavior has long-term rather than
short-term rewards (Aarts, Paulussen, & Schaalma, 1997). For
example, people may be convinced that they should adopt a
healthier lifestyle, but when they formulate and then implement
plans to do so, they experience little immediate evidence that
the new responses (e.g., increasing exercise, following a lowfat diet) enhance well being. In addition to experiencing uncertainty and apprehension about how to perform the new behaviors
(outcomes likely with any shift in response), the healthy behaviors themselves may, in the short run, appear to diminish enjoyment in life. Given the lack of immediate evidence that the new
responses will yield positive outcomes, many people will not
persist. They will not exert deliberate control of performance
details until the new behavior is established with sufficient
strength to proceed automatically without conscious awareness
of intent and to reveal its long-term benefits. Old habits are then
likely to be maintained because of the speed and ease with
which past patterns of behavior can be initiated and executed,
because the old behaviors are cued by prevailing environmental
events, and because these patterns are not inconsistent with
short-term goals.
The most effective change strategies are likely to be ones that
impede performance of established behavior while facilitating
formation of new behaviors into habits. For example, shifts in
the supporting environment can derail the automatic cueing and
execution of old habits and increase the importance of conscious
intentions. To maintain intentions to adopt a healthier lifestyle,
change strategies should ensure that some immediate, positive
consequences emerge from the new healthy behavior. In addition, effective strategies should provide the opportunity for repetition of the new behavior in a stable supporting environment.

Frequent performance of the desired behavior in such contexts is
especially likely to yield new habits that can themselves proceed
relatively automatically.
