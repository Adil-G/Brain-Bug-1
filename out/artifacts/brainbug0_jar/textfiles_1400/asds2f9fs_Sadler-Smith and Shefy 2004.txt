Understanding
and

'gut

in
decision-making
Eugene Sadler-Smith and Erella Shefy

Executive Overview
Even though the conditions under which executives operate may sometimes limit or
even preclude the use of rational analysis, it is nevertheless the norm in many
organizational decision processes. Intuition, on the other hand, is often considered to be
the antithesis of this approach and is usually overlooked or disregarded in decisionmaking. However, in recent years there has been resurgence of interest in intuition,
perhaps because of some dissatisfaction with rationality and its limits and also because
some psychologists are now arguing that much of cognition occurs automatically outside
of consciousness and in the realm of intuition.
Knowledge of intuition has made significant advances in recent years, and it can now
be understood as a composite phenomenon involving interplay between knowing
(intuition-as-expertise) and sensing (intuition-as-feeling). Furthermore, rather than being
set in opposition to each other, intuition and rational analysis are better conceived of as
two parallel systems of knowing. Against this backdrop we consider the significance of
the two facets of intuition for executive decision-making processes. From this integrated
perspective we offer some guidelines whereby executives can make more effective and
intelligent use of intuition in ways that acknowledge its limitations while maximizing its
potential in enhancing firm success in complex and fast-moving business environments.

Balancing Intuition and Rationality

often contradictory, ambiguous, and surprising
places, and that their environments are becoming
increasingly complex and unpredictable. Together
these factors make fragmented and multiple demands upon executives. Fast, high-quality, strategic decision-making in this context represents a
fundamental dynamic capability in high-performing organizations. The traditional response to this
challenge has been rational analysis: information
is collected, collated, analyzed and interpreted, alternatives are formulated, and a logical choice is
consciously arrived at.2 However, in modern business environments, a number of factors can affect
the efficacy of an exclusively rational process.
Strategies and tactics can be thrown off course by
factors ranging from wars, global terrorism, and
new diseases to more mundane everyday matters
such as computer glitches and minor accounting
foul-ups. Technological advancement and developments in organizational systems and processes
have contributed to an explosion in the volume of

Executive intuition is the skill of focusing on those
potentially important but sometimes faint signals
that fuel imagination, creativity, and innovation
and feed corporate success in globally competitive
business environments. A former vice president of
the leading cosmetic MNC L'Oreal is quoted as
saying that decision-making intelligence requires
a fine balancing of two seemingly contradictory
capabilities: intuition and rationality. The first one
allows executives to pick up on important but
weak signals; the second enables executives to act
on them. The CEO of the same company sees the
challenge for executives as a matter of imagination and intuition in equal parts: "It is intuition
[when one asks] 'What do these brands have that
just might seduce the world?' But also in terms of
imagination, [one asks] 'What could they become
to seduce the world?' "1
We are only too well aware that businesses are

data that executives may be required to deal with.
The volume and complexity of available information has the potential to be overwhelming. The
CEO of a major energy corporation recently made
this point quite succinctly:
Ignoring them [intuitions] has led to some bad
decisions.. .you have to learn to trust your
intuition. Otherwise, at the point when you've
gathered enough data to be 99.99 per cent
certain that the decision you're about to make
is the correct one, that decision has become
obsolete.3
On the other hand, individuals and firms are often
exhorted to undertake new venturing opportunities
in novel and unfamiliar environments where, for
them, there may be an information vacuum.
The requirement for fast decisions and the limits
of human beings' rational information-processing
capacities may combine to impose severe demands upon executives' cognitive capabilities to
handle masses of information at the necessary
speed. This may result in a combination of volumeinduced and/or complexity-induced
information
overload that may limit or even preclude in-depth
and deliberate consideration and balancing of alternative courses of action.4 Even when working in
overloaded, uncertain, and fast-moving conditions,
rationality is seen as indispensable in many strategic management decision processes. Moreover, as
far as the education and training of executives go,
rationality is, with a few exceptions, still the norm in
the business and management school curriculum.

Intuition is a capacity for attaining direct
knowledge or understanding without the
apparent intrusion of rational thought or
logical inference.
Intuition is a capacity for attaining direct knowledge or understanding without the apparent intrusion of rational thought or logical inference. Our
fundamental precept in the context of executive
decision-making is twofold: firstly, intuition is as
important as rational analysis in many decision
processes; secondly, there are ways in which executives can improve their intuitive knowledge,
understanding, and skill.
In this article, we aim to review and synthesize
relevant theory and research in order to suggest
how executives may be able to better focus upon
ways in which intuition may affect their personal
decision-making
behaviors and upon ways in

77

which they might use intuition more intelligently.
Drawing upon extant theory and research, we
present an integrated and up-to-date account that
identifies two principal facets of intuition and
which explores their relevance for executive decision-making behaviors. Recommendations for how
executives can put this knowledge into action in
order to enhance their decision-making
follow
each section. These guidelines are also summarized later in Table 1.
Rationality and Decision-Making
Being rational entails the acquisition of knowledge through the power of conscious reasoning
and deliberative analytical thought. The pre-eminence of the rational paradigm in management is
often justified by the assumptions that executives
are inherently rational decision-makers who seek
to maximize outcomes in a world where business
environments are considered objective entities
and successful strategies are the product of deliberate planning.5 In practice this means: the more
information, the better; 'cool and calm' strategic
thinking should not be debased by feelings; efficient thought and behavior must be called upon to
subjugate emotion; and good organizations manage employees' feelings or design them out of the
process.6 Sticking rigidly to such a position raises
a number of problems.
For example, being exclusively rational requires
some measure of agreement about goals since
these will determine what information should be
collected and how it should be analyzed. Agreement about cause-and-effect relationships is similarly important since this will inform plans and
predictions about future actions and their outcomes. There is an inherent assumption that
knowledge is recognizable
and valuable only
when it is explicit, untainted by feelings, and open
to conscious thought and introspection. Against
this rational backdrop, the significance of unconscious mental processes and feelings should not
be underestimated or overlooked since they can be
a source of intuitively based judgments that may
provide an alternative to consciously derived rational choices.
An important issue at the root of debates about
the utility of rationality is the role of uncertainty
and the availability of information upon which
executives may base their decisions. The relationship between decision-making
and uncertainty
has been interpreted and explained in a number of
different ways. For example, some have argued
that uncertainty increases the degree of procedural rationality that is required in order that in-

<-----Page 3----->78

Academy of Management

formation gaps can be filled and uncertainty may
be removed by further analyses.7 Some studies
suggest that rational decision-making does have
situational superiority under particular sets of circumstances.8 Other research has revealed a negative relationship between uncertainty (the extent to
which the problem is similar to others that have
been dealt with in the past) and rationality (the
extent to which information search, analysis, and
use of quantitative techniques contribute to a decision choice).9 The rational method can undeniably lead to effective decisions.'0 However, when
outcomes are difficult to predict through rational
means, executives need to acknowledge the uncertainties, be more tolerant of ambiguities, be able to
respond to complexities in pragmatic, intelligent
and fast ways in the face of the unknown, and
recognize the potential that their intuitive judgments may offer. Moreover, where decisions do
have to be taken speedily and with cognitive economy in the face of an overwhelming mass of information or tight deadlines, executives may have no
choice but to rely upon intelligent intuitive judgments rather than on non-existent or not-yet-invented routines.
When deliberative
rational thought is not
achievable or desirable (for example, where unambiguous or sufficient 'hard' data is not immediately at hand, might never be available at all, or
where creative solutions to problems are needed),
one way of managing and coping with uncertainty
and complexity and of 'thinking outside of the box'
is by relying upon intuition. As an outcome of an
unconscious process in which there is little or no
intrusion
apparent
of deliberative
rational
thought, intuitions can be considered 'soft data'
that may be treated as testable hypotheses ("Do
the facts and figures back up my intuition?") or
used to check out a rationally derived choice ("How
do I feel about the decision I've made?"). In this
respect, a carefully crafted intuitive knowledge,
understanding, and skill may endow executives
with the capacity for insight, speed of response,
and the capability to solve problems and make
decisions in more satisfying and creative ways.
There are those who offer the view that affect is
data, albeit of a rather special kind" but with the
important caveat that unconscious mental processes and affect should not be treated as directives, but neither should they be ignored or dismissed as irrelevant. There are also those who
argue that it is not possible to make effective decisions without using intuition. We prefer to argue
that executives need to be able to recognize and
understand intuition, accept it, establish ways in
which they can be comfortable with it, and lever-

age its potential for success and well-being both
for themselves and for those whom they lead. This
knowledge, understanding, and skill constitute an
intuitive awareness, and in our view the question
of how this may be developed is important both for
executives themselves and for those educators and
consultants whose aim it is to improve executives'
decision-making skills. This is especially important given that management education and training in general appear to be lacking in this regard
(there are of course notable exceptions). Researchbased knowledge allied to our own experiences in
training and developing executives' intuitive skills
leads us to the view that executives can begin to
understand and craft their individual intuitive decision-making
capabilities
by following some
fairly straightforward guidelines.
Intuition and Management
The subject of intuition has figured in philosophy,
psychology, and the social and natural sciences
over the ages from Aristotle and Ovid, through
Spinoza, Michael Faraday, and William James, to
the 20th century where Henri Bergson, Carl Jung,
Bertrand Russell, Jonas Salk, and Albert Einstein
all attested to the value of intuition as a unique
way of knowing. Intuition in management was discussed explicitly as far back as Chester Barnard's
Functions of the Executive in 1938, but over the
intervening decades, despite occasional bouts of
rhetoric, it has (with a few exceptions) tended to be
downplayed or overlooked. However, in recent
years there has been something of a resurgence of
interest in intuition among academics and practitioners, perhaps because of a dissatisfaction with
rationality and its limits,'2 perhaps because it resonates with the more holistic and spiritual Zeitgeist of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and
also because some psychologists are now arguing
that much, if not most, of cognition occurs automatically outside of consciousness.13
Intuition is difficult to describe but easy to recognize. Many of us will be intimately familiar with
our own intuitions and will probably be able to
identify, and may even envy or admire, those individuals who confidently display a 'gut feel' for
complex situations and who appear to have an
'instinct' for grasping key issues quickly. They can
often instantaneously recognize in a highly convincing manner whether an investment is likely to
turn sour, whether a potential hire is good or bad,
whether a new product will make it or not; but
frustratingly they may find it difficult to articulate
the reasons behind these decisions which may just
'feel right.'

use intuition?

Do Executives Use Intuition?

How do executives

If one accepts, firstly, that rationality has limits (to
the extent that it may not be applicable exclusively
in certain situations), and secondly that intuition is
a naturalistic phenomenon to which human beings
are subject, the question then is raised as to
whether or not executives use intuition when making decisions. A moment's introspection may reveal that even if we do not see ourselves as natuwe may be the
rally intuitive decision-makers,
reluctant recipients of our own intuitions because
of their pervasiveness and involuntary nature. Intuitions are not arrived at through an effort of will.
If it is inevitable that executives will experience
intuition, we may then ask just when and how they
use it.

Isenberg identified a number of ways in which
executives use intuition: sensing a problem; performing pre-programmed behavior patterns; producing an integrated picture; as a check on rational analysis; and as a way to by-pass analysis.'6
Arguably, therefore, becoming a more effective decision-maker is about learning to make sense of
intuition, judging when to trust it, and feeling confident enough through practice to use it. For example, a director of a global consultancy firm said:

When do executives

use intuition?

Research suggests that executives do make significant use of intuition. For example, in an internaasked
tional study, Parikh and his colleagues
managers to indicate from a list of functional areas
of decision-making those in which they thought
intuition has a role to play.'4 A majority of respondents felt that intuition was significant for decisions in corporate strategy and planning, marketing, human resource development, research and
development, public relations, investments and
acquisitions, and mergers and alliances. A minority of respondents felt that intuition has a role to
play in decisions relating to capital expenditure,
finance, and production and operations management.

Research suggests that executives
make significant use of intuition.

do

An overwhelming majority felt that many senior
managers use intuition to some extent in making
decisions, that it can contribute to greater success,
and that it should form part of the management
education and development curriculum. Other interview-based research in the USA suggests that
intuitive decisions are most frequently viewed by
executives themselves as being based upon experience (expertise that has been built up, is held in
a mental map or schema, and influences conscious
thought and behavior but not always by any apparent deliberative rational means) and feelings
(where affect in the form of a gut feeling can exert a
quite compelling influence upon decision choices).'5

Intuition presents the possibility of turning
ideas into action and speeding up decisionmaking. I would not like to see managers
consciously squashing their intuition. I would
much rather they went around saying "I think
we should do this because I feel it might
work."'7
Hayashi argued that a 'business instinct' (intuition)
is an important factor in singling out successful
performers and that intuition is needed increasingly as people climb the corporate ladder. He
cited the views of a senior executive of one the
world's largest pharmaceutical companies:
Very often people will do a brilliant job up
levels
through the middle-management
where it's heavily quantitative, in terms of the
decision-making. But then they reach senior
management, where the problems get more
complex and ambiguous, and we discover
that their judgment or intuition is not what it
should be. And when that happens, it's a big
problem.'8
It is not only high fliers in major corporations
who have testified to the value of intuition; there is
a long tradition of systematic research into the role
of intuition in clinical practice in health and related fields, particularly in relation to the differences between experts and novices. In educational
management, a study of the intuitive experiences
among a sample of college principals found that

during
surfaced early
and was combined with rational analysis at some
point in the process.'9
In addition to the case study-based and anecdotal accounts, there have been quantitatively
based empirical studies of management intuition
which suggest that: senior managers are likely to
be more intuitive than their middle and junior
counterparts; small business entrepreneurs are as

<-----Page 5----->80

Academy of Management Executive

intuitive as senior managers in large firms; and
executives in high-growth small businesses are
likely to be more intuitive than their lower-growth
counterparts. Studies of executive thinking using
cognitive mapping techniques revealed that many
senior managers traded depth of information for a
breadth that took in the whole view and in which
they used narratives and symbols in the forms of
personal experiences in rationalizing their intuitive decisions.20
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)is a questionnaire that can be used to assess the extent to
which (among other things) people make sense of
their perceptions of the world through intuition. A
long tradition of management research using the
MBTI21has concluded that intuitive managers are
more likely than other types to favor more abstract
information and perceptual processes, be inclined
toward idealistic, unconventional, and creative behaviors, and engage in strategic planning activities more frequently and effectively. Intuitive types
tend also to feel self-sufficient and trusting of their
own judgment, able to live with ambiguities and
uncertainties,22 and also be confident in the information they have at hand (paradoxically, too much information can lead to decreased decision performance but increased feelings of satisfaction23).
Intuition in Organizations
Research suggests that the proportion of executives with an intuitive preference is likely to increase with seniority. This is explainable in at
least two ways. Intuitive skills (such as holistic
and visionary thinking) may help some executives
to attain senior positions; hence, intuitive types
may thus become disproportionately represented
at higher levels in organizations. Alternatively, top
executives' job responsibilities may demand that
they hone their existing intuitive capabilities more
fully than managers lower down the hierarchy.
From a career development and human resource
planning perspective, it is important that executives have the opportunity to develop the necessary decision skills and cognitive strategies (including those that are intuitively based) to fit the
demands of their current or future job roles.
Organizational power may also play an important part in shaping the extent to which intuition is
used and 'owned up' to. For example, seniority may
legitimize the use of intuitive approaches by
groups such as managers and executives while
employees lower down the hierarchy, even though
they may be subject to their own intuitions, may
feel the need to legitimize their decisions by rationalizing through collecting 'hard data' and anatlyz-

ing it. Moreover, employees at all levels may not
be predisposed to openly admitting to colleagues,
superiors, or subordinates that they might be basing
their actions on their gut feelings. Hence one might
speculate on how widespread 'closet intuition' is.

Research suggests that the proportion of
executives with an intuitive preference is
likely to increase with seniority.
The extent to which intuition is used in decisionmaking may also be influenced by external stakeholders, depending upon their level of influence.
Where this is high, they may explicitly or implicitly
insist upon rational procedures in support of decisions. Finally, executives themselves may be required to display rationality to convince or impress
those who exercise power over them (or those whom
they manage) of the legitimacy of their actions.

Recommendation

1: Open up the closet

As a psychological process, intuition is automatic
and involuntary. Research also suggests that intuition as an organizational process is widespread
across a number of important functional areas of
management. Against this background, the working environment of executives can support or suppress this automatic and involuntary process
through socio-cultural factors which may lead, for
example, to general conformance to a rational paradigm (for example, by 'group-think') and collective forms of cognitive inertia (such as 'grooved
thinking'24). The concomitant danger is that if intuition is continually suppressed, it may cease to
operate25 or may be driven underground. Executives may then come to rely upon it privately and
covertly with a potentially detrimental effect upon
individual and collective learning. The following
questions may help you to gauge the extent to
which you rely upon intuition in your decisionmaking.
Do you trust your hunches when confronted by
an important decision?
Do you feel in your body if a decision is right or
wrong?
Do you put a lot of faith in your initial feelings
about people and situations?
Do you put more emphasis on feelings than data
when you make a decision?
Do you rely on your gut feelings when dealing
with people?
Do you trust your experience when arriving at

<-----Page 6----->Sadler-Smith and Shefy

2004

the reasons for making a decision even if you
can't explain why?
Does your intuition often turn out to have been
right all along?
What is (or would be) the reaction in your organization to decisions made on the basis that they
felt right?
Do you keep your intuitions close to your chest? If
so, why?26

Defining Intuition
Intuition is often depicted in a variety of ways,
sometimes with connotations of mystery and the
paranormal. At other times it may be confused
with biological and cognitive processes such as
instinct and insight. The root of the term 'intuition'
may be traced to the Latin intueor or intueri meaning 'to contemplate' or 'look within.' Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky defined intuitive judgments as those that are arrived at by an informal
and unstructured mode of reasoning without the
use of analytical methods or deliberative calculation.27 Theory and research suggest that intuition
encompasses
expertise, judgment and implicit
learning, sensitivity and feelings, rumination, incubation, and creativity.28 But how do executives
themselves understand intuition? In Parikh's studies, executives were asked to indicate what they
personally understood by the term 'intuition.' Descriptions offered included: decision or perception
without recourse to logical or rational methods;
inherent perception; inexplicable comprehension;
a feeling that comes from within; integration of
previous experience; and processing of accumulated information (only a very small minority of
respondents described it as a 'sixth sense').
We define intuition as a form of knowing that
manifests itself as an awareness of thoughts, feelings, or bodily sense connected to a deeper perception, understanding, and way of making sense of
the world that may not be achieved easily or at all
by other means.
Recommendation

2: Don't mix up your I's

A well-honed understanding of intuition does not
confuse it with: (1) insight: this literally means seeing the solution to the problem, and while we may
not always be able to see in a visual sense the
solution that we have arrived at, we can usually
explain its elements and their logical inter-relationships. Hence insight ultimately is conscious
and explicable (sometimes after a process of incubation-see
below); (2) instinct: these are the inbuilt fast biological reactions with which evolution
has equipped us in order that we can respond to

81

stimuli in ways that maximize our chances of survival in the face of a physical threat; (3) incubation:
this is the unconscious processing of information
which may yield an insight solution in the apocryphal (and insightful) 'eureka' moment. Incubation
is related to intuition (and insight) in that it is the
unconscious part of a process whereby an intuition
(something that we feel but may be unable to articulate) may become validated as an insight (an
explicable solution to a problem).29 However, not
all intuitions become insights; their logical relations may not become clear, and they may remain
for a time as un-validated hazy felt senses or
hunches which may eventually reveal their accuracy or otherwise. Similarly not all insights come
to us via intuitions, in that the solution may come
very quickly, and a developing felt sense may not
be discernable.
Sources of Intuition
'What are the sources of intuition?' is a crucial
question in coming to an understanding of the role
that intuition can play in decision-making
and
how it may be managed more effectively. Is intuition tacit knowledge30 acquired through implicit
learning? Is it the output from a library of expertise
built up over many years? Is it a response driven
by significant emotional memories? Is it derived
from deeper bodily feelings? Or is it a combination
of all these things? As noted earlier, intuition differs from instinct (in-built automatic fast biological
responses) and from insight (literally 'seeing' a
solution to a problem and its logical relations).

'What are the sources of intuition?' is a
crucial question in coming to an
understanding of the role that intuition
can play in decision-making
Intuition relies on both expertise (manifested as
subconscious
decision heuristics) and feelings
(manifested as the affect associated with a particular stimulus). From this standpoint a view
emerges of intuition as a form of cognition that
operates in two ways: 'knowing' (what we will call
'intuition-as-expertise'
and the related notion of
intuition as an aspect of sense-making); and in a
way that connects mind and body through 'feeling'
(we will call this interpretation 'intuition-as-feeling').
There are two further key points to be made at
this juncture. First, intuition-as-knowing and intuition-as-feeling interact and may be indistinguishable from the point of view of the individual. Sec-

<-----Page 7----->82

ond, intuition as a way of knowing also may sit
comfortably alongside rationality as an alternative or complementary form of cognition. There are
of course other interpretations of intuition, including the spiritual and mystical perspectives, but we
have chosen not to consider these here.3'

1. Intuition-as-Expertise
Consider the following
hypothetical
vignette
based on an amalgam of many of the senior executives with whom we have worked:
Daniel is a senior executive with fifteen years
of experience. He has been in many challenging and varied situations that have demanded quick and decisive action throughout
his career. One of the qualities that those
around him admire in Daniel is his ability to
make quick and often accurate decisions in
the face of complex problems. But it wasn't
always like that for Daniel. As a young and
inexperienced manager straight out of his
MBA, he made mistakes like everybody else.
He often couldn't see the woods for the trees.
The consequences of some decisions that he
made were significant; others were less critical. However, what is important is that he
learned explicitly and implicitly from his experiences.
He internalized
the lessons
learned (sometimes tacitly), noticed connections that were reinforced by feedback, and
acquired new routines and rules of behavior
(sometimes without realizing it), and these
became part of his cognitive makeup (even
though he may not be able to articulate this).
The upshot of this is that when Daniel
meets simple or not-so-simple situations like
those that he has met in the past, or that share
salient features with past experiences, he can
call upon a repertoire of potential responses
and search for a fit. Daniel's knowledge base
is akin to an expert system built up over many
years of hard work in learning consciously
and unconsciously through experience and
accumulating wisdom. Often when he makes
a decision or gives a view on an issue, it looks
to outsiders uncannily like a 'management
instinct,' but much of this is experience and
analysis frozen over time into familiar routines and habitual responses which give him
a confidence in his own intuitive capabilities
to the extent that more often than not he does
not need to subject himself to information
overload and the risk of analysis paralysis.

November

But how can executives, like our hypothetical
Daniel, acquire the expertise that enables them to
respond intuitively to problems and decisions and
come up with a single viable option? One way is
through explicit and implicit learning processes.
The concept of explicit learning is familiar to us as
an observable or conscious process often with an
element of intent. Implicit learning, on the other
hand, is a way in which knowledge is acquired by
processes that are largely involuntary and independent of any conscious attempt to learn.32 Implicit learning is pervasive and may result in the
acquisition of tacit knowledge that cannot be described or explained easily but which is stored in
long-term memory in a variety of mental structures
or patterns of thinking. This knowledge may take
the form of images, episodes, or narratives and can
be stored as rules (often too complex for verbal
exposition) for how to achieve specific goals in
particular situations.

The quality and utility of the knowledge
gained from incidental and unplanned
learning opportunities depend upon the
extent to which feedback is used
positively to nurture intuitive skills and
develop good intuitions.
The quality and utility of the knowledge gained
from incidental and unplanned learning opportunities depend upon the extent to which feedback is
used positively to nurture intuitive skills and develop good intuitions. However, feedback is like a
double-edged sword, and the form it takes and the
way it is delivered are crucial in determining if an
executive's environment enhances or suppresses
good intuitions. Hogarth describes environments
that enhance intuition through good feedback as
'kind' structures for learning; 'wicked' structures
for learning on the other hand are those contexts
that may suppress intuition or lead to the development of poor intuitive awareness through little or
low-quality feedback.33
Many will be aware of classic experiments in
which chess grand masters' recall capabilities became perplexed by the random placing on the
board of the chess pieces (in this situation their
recall was no better than that of a novice) compared with their superior recall when the placement of the pieces was meaningful (non-random
and patterned, as they may be in a real game and
thus encoded or approximated in long-term memory).34This helps to explain how it is that when an
expert encounters a problem where the informa-

<-----Page 8----->2004

83

Sadler-Smith and Shefy

tion can be matched to a familiar pattern, a decision protocol may be executed almost automatically.
In other experimental studies, participants have
been required to recognize a coherent pattern and
if they were uncertain were asked to guess. The
results led the researchers to conclude that individuals can respond in a discriminative way to
coherences that they could not consciously and
explicitly identify and that it was tacit understanding that guided their intuitive hunches.35 In a different context, Klein's study of split-second decifound little that
sion-making
by firefighters
corresponded to the accepted rational model;
rather there appeared to be a rapid and unconscious situation assessment and recognition from
an array of stored templates followed by the taking
of appropriate action when a fit was found.36
In certain situations, in bypassing in-depth conscious attempts at analysis, intuition enables executives to move rapidly to a plausible and credible solution. This interpretation of intuition as an
unconscious
expertise differs from models of
purely heuristic thinking in that the latter are narrowly focused on predetermined rules, whereas
the former is based upon a broad constellation of
past experiences, knowledge, skills, perceptions,
and feelings held tacitly and often arrived at by an
implicit perception of the total problem37 before
conscious awareness
takes hold. Tacitly held
knowledge does have behavioral correlates. For
example, researchers have found significant relalevels of tacit
tionships between executives'
knowledge and a number of criterion measures
including success in generating new businesses
and performance in managerial simulation exercises.38

In many situations it is simply not possible for
an individual to explore in a rigorous, methodical,
and exhaustively analytical manner all the data
that he or she confronts; indeed to do so might
result in analysis paralysis. The reason for this is
that rational analysis as an information-processing capacity may not be suited to the volume or
complexity of the information load encountered.
Compounding this overload problem is the assumption that having more information leads to
more rational decisions. Instead of rigorously exploring all the available options, the experienced,
intuitive executive's cognitive system becomes
programmed to look for cues that relate to previously experienced patterns. The former managing
director of Whirlpool Australia, when asked to reflect on the important decisions he faced throughout his career, summed up the importance of gutfeel when he said that it is crucial for executives to
"lssemble the facts in a meaningful way; CEOs

have an intuition about them, they have an instinctive nature, they are watching, listening, gathering
all of the time. If you are not doing that as a CEO,
then you are not fulfilling your role."39 The mental
shortcuts that follow from the meaningful weaving
together of these assembled facts are efficient
ways for the manager to deal with complex and
situations where information-profast-changing
cessing resources may be at a premium. The result
is an optimization of cognitive load.
This process works well in the situations where
a fit with an extant pattern is found. However,
intuitive expertise may not work so smoothly if the
new situation has features that do not appear to
match or approximate those that have been previously encountered. Klein argues that in these situations individuals look for further cues to try to
interpret any anomalies, keeping perceptions open
and attuned, and constructing narratives that
make sense and overcome the 'background noise'
that may impede efforts at interpretation. Under
these circumstances intuition may be thought of as
a sense-making process40 whereby concepts and
their relationships may be re-defined and adjustments made to the relevant mental structures to
take situational differences into account. The
structures themselves become adapted and more
elaborated through the process of learning. For
new information to be accommodated in this way
can take time. Hence it may take longer to arrive at
a solution that 'feels' right, and therefore the decision process may be more labored and more demanding of cognitive resources.
Recommendation

3: Elicit good feedback

The actions and experiences of executives and the
associated implicit learning processes are important tools in building intuitions.41 However, learning through implicit processes can become passive
and reactive. In this situation executives' learning
is likely to be strongly influenced by the characteristics of the task or the context in which they
find themselves. As noted earlier, the knowledge
gained from incidental and unplanned learning
opportunities depends crucially upon feedback (for
example, in terms of Hogarth's 'kind' and 'wicked'
structures for learning). The feedback that an executive receives can be misleading. For example,
if he or she is surrounded by employees who are
not prepared to challenge decisions made from the
top, the learning structure of the environment may
be wicked in the sense that it is unlikely to lead to
good intuitions because wrong lessons will have
been learned. Contrast this with a more constructively criticaxl environment or an experienced

<-----Page 9----->Academy of Management

84

coach or mentor who is able to give honest, accurate, and constructive feedback on an executive's
behaviors, attitudes, and performance. This would
help create an environment with a kind learning
structure which in turn may lead to good intuitions
because the right lessons will have been learned
from a more faithful and honest interpretation of
action.42
How kind or wicked is your learning environment? For example, in terms of the extent to
which intuition is supported or suppressed,
and in terms of the quality of the feedback
that you receive?
How could you make it less wicked for nurturing your intuitive skills?
What could you do to make it kinder for nurturing your intuitive skills?
2. Intuition-as-Feeling
For many people intuition is synonymous with 'gut
feel,' and this somatic view of intuition (from the
Greek soma for 'body' and meaning a bodily sense)
is ubiquitous across cultures and languages. For
example, in Hebrew we have the phrase tchushat
beten, literally 'feeling stomach.' One approach to
perspective is
understanding this feelings-based
by examining recent neuropsychological research.
The following experiment was reported in the New
York Times in 1997:
The neurologist Antonio Damasio and his colleagues Hannah Damasio, Antoine Bechara,
and Daniel Tranel explored the levels of emotion felt by participants during a card game in
which the decision to choose from decks A
and B resulted in large gains or losses,
whereas deciding to choose from decks C and
D resulted in small gains or losses. Emotional
reactions during the game were measured
using changes in skin conductance that occur
as a result of 'micro-sweating.' Damasio was
interested in the ways in which participants
appeared to learn unconscious decision behaviors to avoid decks A and B (the microsweating is thought to reflect tiny flickers of
emotion that are below the level of conscious
awareness). The measures revealed that participants experienced a marked increase in
skin conductance
prior to choosing from
decks A and B, even though they were unable
to verbalize what they were doing and why.
From Damasio's research it appeared that a tacit
awareness below participants' level of conscious-

Executive

November

ness triggered a somatic response (manifested as
micro-sweating) to the effect that the decision to
choose from decks A and B was undesirable. The
tacit system governing these feelings appeared to
be activated (and in a sense knew more than the
explicit system) before participants were consciously aware that they had made a decision.
Furthermore, the observation that participants
couldn't articulate these feelings adds weight to
the view of intuition as having unconscious and
somatic components. In his research Damasio focused on negative outcomes of decision choices,
arguing that physiological somatic markers force
attention to the undesirable outcomes that may
accrue from certain actions. The sensation associated with this unconscious process is an unpleasant gut feeling.
Goleman argued that as well as serving as a
warning against certain courses of action, intuitions can also operate positively to alert us to opportunities and that being attuned to personal feelings (bodily senses) makes for sounder personal
decision-making.43 The neural scientist Joseph LeDoux argued that even when we are conscious of
the outcome of an appraisal of a situation, such as
feelings toward a particular person (for example, a
feeling of like or dislike), we do not necessarily
consciously understand the basis of the appraisal
(knowing why we have the feeling). The conscious
outcome may be based upon our inarticulable gut
feel.
In evolutionary terms the limbic system which is
implicated in these intuitive processes is one of the
older parts of the brain and may be a source of the
intuitive signals that manifest themselves as automatic somatic alarm bells. LeDoux suggests that
the amygdala (a part of the forebrain's limbic system involved in functions relating to anger and
aggression) may exercise direct control over our
actions before the higher centers of the brain are
fully aware of what is happening (referred to by
some as 'emotional hi-jacking'44). These bodily
senses may aid executives' decision-making by

feelings over time can help an individual executive determine how much trust she or he can put in
them.

Gut feelings are inevitable, but effective
learning from them is not.
This personal benchmarking is a vital part of the
development of intuitive awareness because it can
assist with validating a gut feel, identifying misleading inferences and counteracting any predisposition to over-rely on intuition in situations when
a rational approach may be more appropriate. It
also can help to distinguish intuition from fears
and other emotions. Furthermore, the emotional
reward and euphoric feelings that an executive
may get by intuitively "calling it right" need to be
balanced against other less accurate intuitive
judgment calls that might be made just as often
but which sometimes might be overlooked or misconstrued in the absence of critical reflection. The
following questions can be used to get a more
systematic feel for your batting average46 in the
context of specific incidents where gut feel played
some role.
Think of an instance where you relied on your
gut feel that resulted in a positive outcome.

Think of an instance where you relied on gut
feel that resulted in a negative outcome.
What was the context? What happened and

Intuition and Imagery
One aspect of intuition common to both the expertise-based and feelings-based perspectives is the
limitation imposed by language upon the expression of intuitions. Attempts at verbalization can
restrict access to the more tacit ways of knowing
such as intuition,47 and the unconscious incubations that eventually lead to insight may literally
be beyond words. Language by its nature segments and analyzes our experiences of the world

into concepts, and we also use words as a means of
expressing our understanding of the relationships
between concepts. When an executive eventually
solves a problem by insight, the result is that he or
she can probably explain the solution. But unlike
insights, intuitions cannot be readily put into
words (indeed this is one of the key differences
between insight and intuition). The anthropologist
Charles Laughlin argued that limiting legitimate
knowledge to that which the brain's linguistic
structures can express acts to restrict the scope of
human knowing.48 Hence, in some ways language
is a double-edged sword that enables us to label
and express our emotions, thoughts, and intentions
but also restricts our thinking by acting as a sieve,
filtering our experiences of and feelings about the
world through a verbal screen. The word (a symbol) is substituted for the experience or feeling;
hence when we try to express our intuitions, we
communicate them second-hand through the linguistic symbols which we use in order to represent
them to others.
Intuition may manifest itself as an image or narrative. Historical and anecdotal accounts testify to
the important role that imagery plays in creative
and intuitive functioning. Many scientists and
technologists attach a great deal of importance to
mental images in the process of idea generation,
scientific problem solving, and invention.49 Creative intuition is a valuable tool for those decisions
that require divergent thinking processes. Since it
is not necessarily a verbal process and hence is
difficult to articulate, the use of images provides
an alternative to the linear, convergent processing
that the "censoring" function of verbalization and
rational analysis may impose upon creative intuition.

Recommendation

5: Use imagery

It has been argued that the mode of presentation of
a problem can exert an influence over the way in
which it is solved. Drawing upon research involving a number of decision-making and probabilityrelated tasks (such as the card problem, the agedrinking problem, and the 'Linda' problem) in
which participants often overlook disconfirmation,
Hogarth argued that visual presentations can provoke an intuitive understanding which is arrived
at implicitly and held tacitly but which may provide an alternative way of identifying anomalies.
The more people are able to think visually, the
more likely they are to use intuitive processes.50
The following is a simple decision visualization
exercise.5'

<-----Page 11----->November

Academy of Management Executive

86

Imagine that you are in a place that you know
and are walking down a well-worn path.
While you are walking, you are going over a
situation that is challenging you. The path
breaks ahead of you into a number of routes,
each representing one of your alternatives.
Notice how you feel when you contemplate
each one. Where does each path take you?
What is each path's effect on you? How hard
is it to visualize walking down one path?
Does one path feel better than the others?
Visualize your chosen path in a number of
years time? How does this feel to you?
Exercises relying exclusively upon narratives and
images based upon meaningful (concrete rather
than abstract) contexts can be helpful in postponing the censorship of language and rational analysis and also in enabling executives to make implicit judgments that may be difficult to articulate
verbally.52 This does not mean that problems visualized necessarily will be solved correctly, but the
use of imagery may create better conditions for
intuitive processes to occur.
Bias Beware!
It has been said of intuition that it is 'sometimes
wrong but never in doubt.' The buzz from making
great decision calls through intuition can be quite
seductive. However, bias (with the possibility of
attendant negative consequences) is just as likely
to be present in intuitive decisions as in any other
types of decision processes. Hence, it is important
that the feelings of certitude that may accompany
some intuitions are subject to scrutiny and that
they are managed as effectively as possible in
order to overcome any biases and to ameliorate
negative outcomes. Not all types of bias apply
across all kinds of decision processes,53 and in this
regard executives need to beware of a number of
potential sources of error and bias in relation to
intuition.
(1) Ease of recall: individuals judge events that
are easy to remember as being more frequent than
those that are less easily recalled. Successful intuitions may be easily recalled and hence judged
to be more frequent than they actually are. This in
turn may have the effect of reinforcing the belief
that successful intuitive judgment calls are frequent. Executives should ask themselves: Are
easy-to-remember intuitions as frequent as they
appear to be and poor intuitive judgment calls
simply forgotten?
(2) Presumed associations: individuals tend to
overestimate the probability of two events co-oc-

curring, and the strength of the presumed relationship may be fallacious. Executives should probe
their intuitive feelings about a decision and the
associated cause-and-effect relationships and try
to distinguish intuition from fallacies.
(3) Over-confidence: the emotional reward from
past successes in intuitive judgments may give
rise to an unjustified feeling of the infallibility of
intuition, which may in turn contribute to the illusion of control and lead to over-confidence in one's
abilities. Executives
intuitive decision-making
should try to distinguish intuition from over-confidence and be realistic about their abilities to control events through intuitive or rational means.
(4) Confirmation bias: we tend to seek confirmatory evidence for what we think is true and neglect
the search for dis-confirmatory evidence. What we
want to happen and what might happen may be
two very different things so the emotion of desire
and the feelings about the rightness or wrongness
of a course of action need to be weighed up as
objectively as possible. Executives should try to
distinguish intuition from wishful thinking.
(5) Hindsight bias: we sometimes overestimate
the degree to which an outcome was correctly predicted. The 'knew-it-all-along' (or 'I should have
followed my gut feel all along') syndrome can be a
significant source of error in human judgment. Executives should try to distinguish intuition from
20-20 hindsight by developing explanations for the
occurrence of outcomes that did not happen and by
examining the ways in which a distorted view of the
past may influence their decision-making in the future.54
Recommendation

6: Play devil's advocate

Sources of bias can lead individuals to adopt a
closed mind when it comes to challenging the information that supports their intuitions (or indeed
their rationality). Belief perseverance can be counteracted by getting into the habit of constructing a
narrative for why a contrary theory might be true.55
Devil's advocacy is a procedure in which one or
more persons (or oneself in the absence of others)
raise objections to favored choices, challenge underlying assumptions, and point out alternatives.
By playing devil's advocate and generating
counter-arguments, executives can probe intuitive
decisions for inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and irrelevancies.56 Alternative courses of action can
then be suggested and explored. This process can
expose weaknesses in an executive's intuitions or
provide support for them, but either way the important thing is that the opportunity has been provided for refutation. Devil's advocacy has been

<-----Page 12----->shown to produce significantly higher-quality decisions compared to consensus group decisions
and is especially useful in ill-structured problem
scenarios of the type where intuition might need to
be relied upon. The dangers of a 'positive hunch'
should be checked out by actively seeking facts
that might corroborate or invalidate the hunch.57
Executives can play devil's advocate by asking
these questions of their own or others' intuitions:

Balancing Intuition and Rationality
A central feature of critiques of the rational decision model was that organizational complexity
and the cognitive capacity of decision-makers may
combine to render rational decisions 'good enough'
(satisficing) rather than 'ideal' (optimizing) behaviors. Hence, outcomes are not irrational but are
reasoned only within limits.58 This treatment of
rationality as bounded is one way in which executives can reduce the cognitive load placed upon
them. It is important to stress that within this purview we are not proposing that intuition is better
than rationality, or indeed vice versa. We are suggesting that a single-minded emphasis on rationality (or intuition) presents a partial view. Executives might achieve a more balanced perspective
by considering both rationality and intuition as
complementary and mutually reinforcing components of a decision strategy.
Intuition is a composite phenomenon that incorporates expertise and feeling, and as such is
linked to mental processes both in the cerebellum
and the limbic system and to bodily felt senses. It
is not simply educated ('smart') guessing; it is more
than 'flight or fight' (instinct) and is distinct from
eureka' experiences (insight). It resides at a level
below consciousness,
axrises cognitively, affec-

tively, and somatically and is manifested as a
'hunch' or 'gut feel.' These feelings may be associated with images or narratives or an abstract feeling of certitude about the rightness or wrongness
of a course of action. When used intelligently, intuition has the potential to enhance executive
judgment and decision-making.
Intuitive knowledge, understanding, and skill
can be learned through experience and practice,59
and over two decades ago Taggart and Robey60
made a plea that the management education curriculum should include intuition. However, in our
view, both as graduates of and teachers in management schools in our respective countries (the
UK and Israel), the overall situation suggests that
little has changed in the intervening twenty years.
One can see reasons why the rational model prevails: it is safe, comforting, and reassuring, and in
many situations it works perfectly well. The intuitive model has more risks attached to it, can be
disconcerting, paradoxical and ambiguous, and in
many routine situations is probably inadvisable.
However, intuition is pervasive, automatic, and involuntary; therefore executives have much to gain
from being able to accept it and manage it. Moreover, there are time-pressured and creative problem-solving situations where intuition is important
and even necessary; therefore executives need to
be able to harness its potential while being aware
of its dangers.

Intuitive knowledge, understanding, and
skill can be learned through experience
and practice.
Recommendation
intuitions

7: Capture and validate your

Hunches and gut feelings arise involuntarily, most
often when the intuitive mind is given freedom to
roam. However the natural tendency of the rational
mind is to censor intuitions before they have a
chance to be fully explicated and tested. It is possible for individual executives to develop techniques that may assist in creating the appropriate
psychological and physiological conditions for intuitions (the 'inner state') and also to develop the
skills to capture, in a systematic way, intuitions
when they do occur. The importance of the outer
environment and the creation of the appropriate
inner state which may promote an intuitive 'flow'
are discussed elsewhere.6'
With regard to capturing this flow, it is possible

Description
To what extent do you: experience intuition; trust your feelings; count on intuitive
judgments; suppress hunches; covertly rely upon gut feel?
Instinct, insight, and intuition are not synonymous; practice distinguishing
between your instincts, your insights, and your intuitions.
Seek feedback on your intuitive judgments; build confidence in your gut feel;
create a learning environment in which you can develop better intuitive
awareness.
Benchmark your intuitions; get a sense for how reliable your hunches are; ask
yourself how your intuitive judgment might be improved.
Use imagery rather than words; literally visualize potential future scenarios that
take your gut feelings into account.
Test out intuitive judgments; raise objections to them; generate
counter-arguments; probe how robust gut feel is when challenged.
Create the inner state to give your intuitive mind the freedom to roam; capture
your creative intuitions; log them before they are censored by rational
analysis.

before the censorship of rationality takes over.
Once captured (admittedly in what may be the
less-than-satisfactory
medium of the written or
spoken word), they can be analyzed and evaluated
and patterns in the intuitive process identified.
One way of doing this is by keeping a diary or
otherwise documenting62 the intuition in terms of:
the time of day at which it occurred; its content; the
physical location at the time; its form (words, images, bodily feelings); and a reflection upon any
biases, fears, or wishful thinking that might contaminate the intuition. This is most successfully
achieved through a formalized diary process over
a pre-defined period with personal reflection and
feedback.63 This and the other recommendations
for developing intuitive awareness are summarized in Table 1.
Becoming Intuitively Intelligent
The relationship between intuition and rationality
can work in a number of ways. For example, proceeding from intuition to rational analysis represents a 'validation' sequence in which gut feeling
may be checked out by rational analysis by posing
questions such as 'Do the data back up my hunch?'
Proceeding from rational analysis to intuition represents an 'incubation' sequence in which intuition
provides an expertise-based or feelings-based validation for judgments arrived at through rational
analysis. For example, executives can ponder in a
non-deliberative manner, 'What does my experience tell me about this decision?' 'Are there any
lessons from the past that I can draw on?' or 'How
does this decision feel to me?' Allowing one's
thinking to iterate between intuition and rational

analysis may allow each mode to reinforce the
other until an optimal judgment can be made that
satisfies both the 'hard' elements (the facts and
figures) and 'soft' elements (the hunch or gut feel).
This process may provide a means by which biases from one source can be offset by those from
the other.64 It may also provide a 'cooling-off' mechanism for managing any overconfidence65 that
may accompany a rationally or intuitively derived
decision choice.
Intuition and rationality are two parallel systems of knowing; in this sense they are dual processes. The conscious rational system has been
described as intentional, analytic, primarily verbal, and relatively emotion-free; it encodes information in abstract symbols and concepts. The intuitive system has been described as automatic,
holistic, primarily non-verbal, and associated with
emotion and feeling; it encodes information in concrete forms such as examples, images, and stories66 and as unconscious decision heuristics. Research indicates that both the expertise and
feeling facets of intuition originate below the level
of conscious awareness and are inter-linked. The
rational system exists in conscious awareness
alongside the intuitive system. The rational and
the intuitive systems are not unbridgeable, and the
challenge is to weave the two together67 and integrate intuition with rationality in order to make
intelligent use of intuitive judgments. Successful
decision-makers are those who, in the words Adam
Smith, "do not necessarily have a complete portrait
of themselves, warts and all, but they do have the
ability to stop abruptly when their own intuition
and what is happening Out There are suddenly out
of kilter. "68

<-----Page 14----->2004

Sadler-Smith and Shefy

The intuitive and rational mindsets are at the
heart of an important dynamic in executives' cognition. The dichotomy of intuition and rationality is
a false one. Moreover, the portrayal of intuition as
the infallible but ineffable 'good guy' and rationality as the mechanistic but manageable 'bad guy
(or vice versa) is biased and erroneous.69 It makes
no sense to talk of intuition versus rationality but
only of intuition and rationality. By considering
only rationality, one is left with a partial means of
knowing the world and its possibilities. Intuition
and rationality are complementary to the extent
that executives need to be able to learn how to use
each to fit the demands of particular decision-making situations. The education and training of executives emphasizes rational analysis and, by and
large, appears to pay scant regard to creative intuition. The challenge is for executives to extend,
possibly through training, self-development, feedback, and coaching, their own repertoire of skills
and strategies for intuitive judgment and to apply
them frequently and naturally, and in doing so
acquire a more comprehensive armory of decisionmaking skills.

Intuition and rationality are two parallel
systems of knowing; in this sense they
are dual processes.
Intuition is a natural component of executives'
thinking but one that, although we are often all too
aware of it, we may tend to ignore or consign to the
closet, perhaps because it is perceived as unscientific and irrational. Intuition-as-expertise and intuare unconscious but explicable;
ition-as-feeling
when understood and managed effectively, they
can be a powerful force in complex and fast-moving business environments and can lead to imcapabilities

are useful only as a starting point for selfreflection and should not be used a basis for typecasting. For
example, Einstein is seen by many as the archetypal rational
mind. but he is widely reported as recognizing intuition as the

surroundings, thoughts, and behaviors and is engendered by
pausing and examining our perceptions and feeling states as
dispassionately as we can through a non-reactive awareness
and openness to whatever the object of our attention is and our
context, with the aim of avoiding premature cognitive commitment (see Austin, J.H.1998.Zen and the brain. Cambridge, MA.:
The MITPress). Taggart described a quiet, relaxed mind that is
focused upon the present moment and free of distracting fears
and desires as the sine qua non of intuitive experience (1997,op.
cit., 182).Intuitive flow experiences are discussed extensively in
Csikszentmihalyi, M. 1992.Flow: The psychology of happiness.

6 Writers such as the anthropologist Charles Laughlin attribute this dichotomy to the historical association of intuition
with metaphysics and religion. In the Enlightenment and beyond, religion became the nemesis of science, and hence the
'intuitional baby' was thrown out with the 'metaphysical bathwater.' See Laughlin, C. 1997.The nature of intuition: A neuropsychological approach. In R. Davis-Floyd & P. Sven Arvidson
