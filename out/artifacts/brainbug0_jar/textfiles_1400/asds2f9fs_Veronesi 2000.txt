How Does Information Quality
Affect Stock Returns?
PIETRO VERONESI*
ABSTRACT
Using a simple dynamic asset pricing model, this paper investigates the relationship between the precision of public information about economic growth and stock
market returns. After fully characterizing expected returns and conditional volatility, I show that (i) higher precision of signals tends to increase the risk premium,
(ii) when signals are imprecise the equity premium is bounded above independently of investors' risk aversion, (iii) return volatility is U-shaped with respect to
investors' risk aversion, and (iv) the relationship between conditional expected returns and conditional variance is ambiguous.

IN MODERN FINANCIAL MARKETS, investors

are flooded

with a variety

of infor-

mation: corporations' earnings reports, revisions of macroeconomic indexes,
policymakers' statements, and political news. These pieces of information
are processed by investors to update their projections of the economy's future growth rate, inflation rate, and interest rate. In turn, these changes in
investors' expectations affect stock market prices. However, even though it is
clear that asset prices react to new information, several questions arise regarding the relationship between the quality of information that investors
receive and asset returns. For example, what kind of effect does a noisy
signal on the "health" of the economy have on stock market prices? If information is noisy, is there a risk premium? Or is the risk premium completely
independent of the quality of information investors receive? Also, how does
the precision of the signals affect stock market volatility? If signals are more
precise, does stock market volatility decrease or increase? Finally, can we
infer how good investors' information is from the behavior of stock market
returns?
In this paper I study a dynamic asset pricing model where I try to answer
the above questions. Specifically, I assume that stock dividends are generated by a diffusion process whose drift rate is unknown to investors and may

change at random times. Investors learn about the "true" drift rate through
the observation of realized dividends and another noisy signal, which proxies for the many sources of information I refer to above. The main objective
of the paper is to characterize equilibrium asset returns when different assumptions on the precision of information-that
is, the noise of the signalare made.
The first surprising result is that more precise signals tend to increase
rather than decrease the equity risk premium-that
is, there is no risk premium for noisy signals. The converse is also surprising: When signals are
noisy, there is an upper bound to the equity premium and this upper bound
is independent of investors' degree of risk aversion. Hence, the Mehra and
Prescott (1985) equity premium puzzle becomes even more puzzling under
the assumption of noisy information because the actual equity premium cannot be matched by assuming a high degree of risk aversion.
To understand the intuition behind these results, consider the second result first. As an extreme and simple case, suppose that dividend realizations
are the only signal investors receive about a constant dividend growth rate.
Typically then, negative dividend innovations imply a downward revision of
expected future dividends and hence of future consumption, because dividends and consumption are highly correlated (in fact, equilibrium market
clearing conditions require them to be equal). Hence, risk-averse investors
increase their hedging demand for the asset to avoid very low levels of consumption in the future. This latter effect tends to increase the stock price,
thereby counterbalancing its tendency to fall due to the initial negative shock
to dividends. When investors are sufficiently risk averse, the positive effect
on the stock price due to investors' hedging demand for stocks tends to dominate. As a consequence, a drop in current consumption due to a negative
innovation in dividends is associated with a small decrease or even an increase in the stock price. That is, in equilibrium the covariance between
consumption and returns is small or even negative for high levels of risk
aversion. This implies a small or negative risk premium. Indeed, when the
coefficient of risk aversion is sufficiently high a further increase in risk aversion decreases the risk premium because of the indirect effect on the covariance of returns and consumption. This implies an upper bound to the equity
risk premium.
more precise signals increase the
Turning now to the opposite result-that
once again an extreme example. Suppose that inrisk premium-consider
vestors know exactly the constant drift rate of the economy: In this case
innovations in dividends do not change investors' expectations of future dividends. Since a higher dividend implies a higher price for given expectations
of future consumption, returns and consumption have positive covariance.
This implies a positive equity risk premium. Moreover, just as in the equity
premium puzzle literature, a higher coefficient of risk aversion increases the
equity risk premium.
The above argument also entails that the precision of signals affects the
equilibrium conditional return volatility. Indeed, I show that when signals
are imprecise, volatility is first decreasing and then increasing in investors'

<-----Page 3----->Information Quality and Stock Returns

809

degree of risk aversion. However, the effect becomes less and less relevant
as we increase the precision of signals. The intuition stems again from the
hedging demand for the asset: When signals are imprecise, dividend realizations have an impact on investors' hedging demand which tends to decrease the volatility of returns compared to the "dividend" volatility. However,
for a sufficiently high risk-aversion coefficient, the indirect effect on the
hedging demand dominates increasing return volatility again-hence
the
U-shaped function of volatility with respect to the coefficient of risk aversion.
An implication of the above discussion is that the relationship between the
conditional risk premium and the conditional variance of returns depends on
the precision of signals, and this relationship is generally ambiguous: When
signals are precise, expected excess returns are positively related to their
conditional variance, but the opposite may be true when they are imprecise,
depending on the level of investors' uncertainty about the true drift of the
economy. This finding helps in explaining the lack of empirical support of a
positive relationship between expected excess returns and their conditional
variance (see, e.g., Campbell et al. (1999) and Scruggs (1998)).
These results also point at an important difference between current dividend realizations and external signals as predictors of future economic performance. Dividend realizations both change investors' current consumption
sets and modify their expectations: Since asset returns depend on changes in
expectations through changes in investors' hedging demand for the asset,
this dual role of dividends introduces a special covariance between contemporaneous consumption and stock returns, positive or negative depending on
investors' preferences. In contrast, external signals only affect expectations
and cannot change investors' current consumption sets. As a consequence,
when we increase the precision of external signals we are also decreasing
the sensitivity of investors' hedging demand to dividend realizations. When
signals are perfect, there are no variations in hedging demand due to dividend realizations.
As to the methodology of the paper, I find it useful to discretize the parameter space-that is, the set of possible drifts for the dividend process-to
obtain the dynamics of investors' beliefs in closed form. This approach enables me to show that a stock's expected return and volatility depend on a
single quantity that summarizes both investors' degree of uncertainty on the
true drift of the dividend process and the "relevance" of this uncertainty to
asset pricing. For example, this quantity is zero either when investors have
perfect information or when the price of the asset is independent of the drift
rate of the economy, as in the case where investors have logarithmic utility.
In the latter instance of course uncertainty does not matter for asset pricing.
On the other hand, this quantity is increasing (in absolute value) both with
the "dispersion" of investors' beliefs around the expected growth rate of dividends and the relative difference in asset prices conditional on the various
states.
This paper is most closely related to the literature on learning in financial
markets. Notable works in this area are Williams (1977), Dothan and Feldman (1986), Gennotte (1986), Detemple (1986, 1991), Feldman (1989), Bar-

sky and DeLong (1993), Timmerman (1993), Wang (1993), Detemple and
Murthy (1994), Brennan and Xia (1997), David (1997), Veronesi (1999), and
Zapatero (1998). These papers give various characterizations of portfolio allocation rules, term structure models, and stock returns when investors learn
about some unknown parameters of the economy. However, none of these
papers investigates the issues that I specifically address here-that
is, the
effect of the precision of external signals on the equilibrium stock return
process.
The paper develops as follows: The next section introduces the setup of the
simple economy, Section II describes the dynamics of investors' beliefs, and
Section III characterizes the stock returns and investors uncertainty. Section IV concludes. All proofs are in the Appendix.
I. The Economy
Consider a standard pure-exchange economy (Lucas (1978)) populated by
a continuum of identical investors with isoelastic utility functions,

u(c,t)

-

e- t

cl-Y

C

where y is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and b the discount rate. I
assume that investors' opportunity set comprises a risky security, whose
stochastic dividendl is denoted by D, and a bond, whose risk-free rate of
return is r. Dividends grow according to the following process:
dD = ODdt + oJDDdBD,
where BD denotes a standard Brownian motion. I assume that investors do
not observe the drift 0(t). They only know that it can be any of n possible
values 01 < 02< ... < Onand that in any infinitesimal time-interval A there
is probability piX that a new drift will be chosen according to the probability
distribution f = (f1, .. ., fn). Since there are no restrictions on n, we can think
of the points in 0 {= 01,...,n0} as forming a fine grid on the real interval
0
[01 On]

Even though investors do not observe the true drift, I assume they observe
a noisy signal:

where Be is a standard Brownian motion independent of BD. This form of the
signal is the continuous time analog of the standard "signal equals funda'Dividend and output are used interchangeably throughout the paper. Since, in equilibrium,
output also equals consumption, the three words are actually synonyms in this setup.

discrete time model (e.g., see Detemple (1986)). The inverse of the diffusion
parameter,
he

l/Se

reflects the precision of the external signal. I say that investors have precise
signals when he is relatively high. When p = 0 and he approaches infinity,
the model gets closer to the standard textbook model where investors know
the constant drift rate 0. Similarly, the precision of the "dividend signal" is
hD = 1IOD

The main goal of this paper is to characterize asset returns in this economy
with parameter uncertainty and study their behavior for different values of
the precision of the external signal he. Equilibrium prices and interest rates
are determined in equilibrium by standard market clearing conditions. Specifically, if P denotes the price of the risky asset and r the instantaneous
interest rate, then investors choose the fraction of wealth invested in stock,
a(t), and consumption, c(t), in order to solve the maximization problem:

II. The Dynamics

of Investors'

Beliefs

Let me denote investors' information set at time t by SF(t). This contains
all past realizations of dividends and signals. Let - i(t) be investors' beliefs
that the drift rate is Oi at time t, conditional on their information 2F(t):
-iTi(t )

= Prob(Of

Also, let me denote the vector of these probabilities by H = (T...

This distribution summarizes investors' overall information at time t. Given
these beliefs, they can compute the expected drift rate at time t:

Expression 5 is quite intuitive: The stochastic components dBD and dBe
are the normalized innovation processes of dividend and signal realizations.
Since each of them enters in equation (5) normalized by its own precision
parameter, signals have greater weight in investors' posterior distribution
than dividends whenever they have higher precision-that
is, whenever
he > hD. The drift p (fi - -ri) is a mean-reverting component that pulls rii
toward fi, which is the relative proportion of time that O(t) equals 0i in the
long run. It is intuitive that, other things equal, a higher frequency p of
shifts implies that the conditional distribution (7rn...

Hence, the speed of mean reversion in equa-

In order to gather some more intuition about the process of equation (5), it
is useful to rewrite it in terms of the original processes BD and Be. This
exercise yields the description of the process diri from the perspective of an
outside observer who knows that during some time interval [t1, t2] the true
drift rate 0(t) is equal to a particular 0f. As the following corollary shows,
we can then gauge how the precision of the signals affects the dispersion of
investors' beliefs around the true state.
2 Notice also that every solution (QT1(t).....,(t))
to equation (5) has the property that for all

that -rj(t) > 0 for all i and t.

Each constant Ci represents the investors' expectation of future dividends
conditional on the state being Oitoday, discounted by the marginal utility of
consumption and normalized to make it independent of the current dividend
and time. Hence, a high Ci implies that investors would be willing to pay a
high price relative to the current dividend in state Oi. Since they do not
actually observe the state Oi, they weight each Ci by its conditional probability -ri, thereby obtaining equation (7).
The next proposition characterizes equilibrium stock returns. For notational convenience, let me denote the total excess returns by

Notice both the drift and the volatility of equilibrium stock returns can be
fully characterized by studying the behavior of a single quantity V0. This
task is undertaken below.
A. Investors' Uncertainty
In this section I discuss the behavior of the quantity V0 that characterizes
the stock return process given in equation (10). Let me define the following

be the expected growth rate of the economy according to the value-adjusted
distribution. It is immediate to see that
V=m - mO

(15)

Therefore, V0 reflects the relative distance between the true expected growth
rate of the economy and the value-adjusted expected growth rate. Intuitively, V0 can be considered a summary of both investors' degree of uncertainty about the true growth rate 0 as well as the impact of this uncertainty
on the investors' own valuation of the asset. For example, when H is a degenerate distribution giving probability one to a state Se or when Ci is constant for all i, then V0 is zero. In the first case there is no uncertainty; in the
second case uncertainty does not matter because investors assign the same
value to the asset in every state. However, in general V0 is different from
zero; in fact, V0 tends to be bigger (in absolute value) either when investors
have more diffuse beliefs or when they value the asset very differently across
states.
Finally, the sign of V0 is also important: If V0 is positive, then on average
investors deem the asset more valuable in states that have higher growth
rate than mi, whereas when V0 is negative they deem the asset more valuable in states with a lower growth rate.
The following two lemmas make the above statements formal: The first
characterizes the vector C and the second the quantity V6.

The function C(O) is monotonic and convex, and it is decreasing in 0 if and
only if y > 1. That is, investors who are more risk averse than the log-utility
investor assign a lower relative value to the asset in higher growth rate
states. From the definition of C1 in Proposition 1 this is not surprising; in
fact, investors discount future dividends using their marginal utility of future consumption. Since in equilibrium consumption equals dividends, even
though a higher growth rate implies a higher expectation of future consumption, investors' discount rates are also higher. It is easy to see that the effect
on the discount rate dominates when y > 1. In other words, when investors
with high coefficients of risk aversion expect low consumption growth, their
hedging demand for assets increases. Since the supply of the risky asset is
fixed while the riskless asset is in zero-net supply, this demand for assets
decreases the interest rate and increases the price of the risky asset relative
to dividends. This implies that C(O) is decreasing. Figure 1 plots the function C(O) for various values of y.
LEMMA

3: V. can be characterized as follows:

(a) V,, < 0 if and only if y > 1. Vo = 0 if and only if y = 1.
(b) Let C(O) be nonconstant and let 11 be a mean-preserving spread of II.3
Then V, < V, if y > 1 and Vf7 > V6 if y < 1, where "-" denotes a
quantity computed using the distribution H.
(c) V, decreases as y increases.
Part (a) of Lemma 3 shows that if investors have high risk aversion, then
the value-adjusted distribution gives more weight to the low-growth states.
This result stems immediately from the fact that C(O) is decreasing and
convex for y > 1.
Part (b) of the lemma instead shows that an increase in "uncertainty" on
the growth rate of the economy increases Vo in absolute value. The intuition
is straightforward as well: A mean-preserving spread increases the dispersion of the distribution H and hence the relative weight given to the tails of
the distribution. Since the function C(O) is convex, the value-adjusted probability distribution becomes even more skewed toward the high-value states.
This increases the effect of the value adjustment, thus the absolute distance
between m, and mo increases.
Part (c) relates the measure Vo to the preference parameter y. The reason
that it holds can be grasped from Figure 1: When y < 1, an increase in y
makes C(O) less convex and hence the effect of the value adjustment on the
mean growth rate m, decreases. Hence, Vo = m, - mo decreases as we increase y toward one. When y > 1, an increase in y increases the convexity of

growth rate mn. This increases Vo in absolute value. Since Vo is negative for
y > 1, this implies that Vo decreases further as we increase y.
B. Investors' Uncertainty and Expected Stock Returns
This section discusses the features of investors' expected returns
start with a formal characterization in the following proposition.

I-CR.

PROPOSITION 3:

(a) If y > 1, then higher uncertainty decreases the risk premium. That is,
a mean-preserving spread on investors' beliefs fI decreases ICtR.
(b) If either m6 > o-D + 01 or 71 < 71 where 7-T, is given in equation (A35)
of the Appendix, the expected excess return AR decreases with y for y
sufficiently high. Hence, ,CR is bounded above.
(c) If m6 > oD + 01, there is y- such that gR < 0 for y > y. Moreover, a
mean-preserving spread on fI decreases -y.
Part (a) of Proposition 3 shows that there is no premium for uncertainty.
Actually, quite the opposite holds. From the characterization of the probability distribution in Lemma 1 a low precision of signal he implies that the
posterior distribution H tends to be more diffuse on the space O. Hence,
Proposition 3(a) implies that when public signals are less precise the expected excess return is smaller. In other words, when there is "better" information about the state of the economy, there is also a relatively high risk
premium. As explained in the introduction, the intuitive explanation of this
seemingly paradoxical result stems from the standard result that the risk
premium depends on the covariance of consumption growth and stock returns; that is,

(18)

When the external signal is very precise, the covariance between consumption and stock returns is higher than in the case where signals are less
precise. In fact, in the latter case a negative innovation in dividends has the
direct effect of decreasing the price of the stock and the indirect effect of
increasing investors' hedging demand for the asset because they now expect
lower consumption in the future. This indirect positive effect on the price
partly dampens the negative direct effect due to the decrease in dividends.
However, as we increase the precision of the signal he, investors' hedging
demand is less and less affected by dividend realizations because investors'
expectations depend more and more on the signal. Since in equilibrium dividends equal consumption, the above discussion entails that as we increase
the precision of external signals the covariance of returns and consumption
increases and so does the risk premium.

<-----Page 13----->Information Quality and Stock Returns

819

Part (b) of this proposition shows that when either investors' expected
growth rate is not too low or 7T, is not too high, there is an upper bound to
the risk premium. The intuition for this result is related to that of part (a):
As usual, for given positive covariance of returns and consumption growth,
higher risk aversion implies a higher risk premium. When signals are not
precise though, an increase in risk aversion also implies a bigger impact of
dividend realizations on investors' hedging demand. As we saw above, this
decreases the covariance itself. Moreover, the second effect dominates for
very high y so that /UR decreases as y increases. I should point out that the
conditions of Proposition 3(b) are generally satisfied when signals are not
precise and n is large, so that the distribution 1His diffuse. In fact, for typical
parameter values of 0, p, and o-D, -Jr is extremely high, well above 0.85.
Finally, part (c) shows that when investors' expected growth rate is not too
low, the risk premium turns negative when investors are sufficiently risk
averse. Once again, this result stems from the fact that high expected future
dividends tend to decrease the covariance between current returns and consumption growth. For sufficiently high y this covariance becomes negative
(see Campbell (1999) for a discussion of a related point).

As ro-increases, bR decreases and becomes negative for a high y. Similarly, Figure 2, Panel B, plots LR against the coefficient of risk aversion y for
ro-= 0.11%. To better understand the effect of changing uncertainty over
time, Figure 3, Panel A, plots LR for various values of y resulting from one
simulation of dividends and posterior distributions. We can see that a high
y does not imply a high ,UCR, which at times can turn negative. From Figure 3, Panel B, we also notice that IR decreases when o increases.
C. Investors' Uncertainty and the Conditional Volatility of Stock Returns
From the equilibrium process for returns (equation (10)) it is immediately
evident that the quantity V.7characterizes return volatility as well. In fact,
o-Ro= CD+ VO[2+ (he + hD)V0].

(19)

The following proposition then holds.
PROPOSITION
4:
CR = CD for y = 1. Moreover, a
mean-preserving spread on LHincreases CR if CR > o-D. The effect is
ambiguous if CR < oD(b) Under the conditions of Proposition 3(c), if he > hD then CR > CD for
a sufficiently high coefficient of risk aversion.

The intuition behind the results in Proposition 4 is the same as the one for
the risk premium. For logarithmic investors, uncertainty (and hence the
precision of signals) does not matter because they value the asset the same
independently of the state. Hence V6 = 0 and oR
o-D. When there is uncertainty about the true drift (Hl nondegenerate), if y > I any positive innovation in dividends increases the price but decreases investors' hedging
demand due to the increase in investors' expectations of future consumption.
Hence, the effect on the price of dividend realizations is not as strong and
return volatility decreases. However, for very high levels of risk aversion the
effect on the hedging demand outweighs the direct effect on the price, thereby
increasing volatility again. In contrast, for y < 1 a positive realization of
dividends increases investors' demand for the asset (substitution effects dominate), thereby further increasing the price of the stock. Hence oR > (oD if
y < 1.

D. The Risk Premium and the Conditional Variance of Returns
From the results about risk premium and return volatility, it is clear that
the relationship between return volatility and expected returns is ambiguous and depends on the degree of investors' uncertainty. This statement can
be made precise by noticing that from equations (11) and (19) we can write
IJR =

R2-

yVO[1 + (he + hD)V0].

(20)

It is apparent then that the relationship between the conditional risk premium and the conditional variance of returns is linear but investors' uncertainty biases this relationship through V0 in an ambiguous way. In fact, the
second term in equation (20) can be positive or negative depending on the
magnitude of V0. Specifically, for log-utility or when signals are very precise,
Vo is approximately zero and hence a linear positive relationship results.
In contrast, when y > 1 and signals are not precise, the second term
in equation (20) is positive for - 1/(h2 + h2) < V0 < 0 and negative for V0 <
- 1/(h2 + h2). Since the magnitude of V0 changes over time due to investors'
fluctuating level of uncertainty, equation (20) implies that there is no precise relationship between expected excess returns and conditional volatility.
Indeed, the empirical finance literature has long documented that the evidence for a positive relationship between expected returns and conditional
return variance is very weak at best (e.g., see Campbell et al. (1999) and
Scruggs (1998)).
IV. Conclusions
This paper shows that the relationship between the precision of public
information about economic growth and the performance of the stock market
is nontrivial. In a standard Lucas economy where the growth rate of output
is unknown but where investors receive signals about it, I obtain results on

<-----Page 17----->Information Quality and Stock Returns

823

equity premium and return volatility that can be deemed counterintuitive at
first: (i) More precise signals on the true state of the economy-that
is,
better information-tend
to increase the equity premium. Therefore, poor
information does not demand a risk premium. (ii) If information is imprecise, then an increase in the risk aversion coefficient does not necessarily
increase the equity risk premium. In fact, there is an upper bound to the
equity risk premium. Moreover, higher uncertainty (i.e., poorer signals) implies that the upper bound is achieved for a lower coefficient of risk aversion
y. (iii) When signals are imprecise, return volatility is U-shaped with respect to investors' coefficient of risk aversion. (iv) The relationship between
expected returns and return volatility is ambiguous and depends on investors' level of uncertainty.
The channel through which the precision of public information affects stock
returns is its influence on the equilibrium covariance between current consumption and returns. In fact, there is a qualitative difference between dividends and "other statistics" as signals of future economic performance: Though
"other statistics" affect only investors' expectations, dividend realizations also
affect investors' consumption possibilities. Hence, the implied covariance between consumption and return is modified as we change the precision of
external signals.
A few final remarks are in order. First, the model implies that when the
external signals are not precise the conditional expected excess return may
become negative when the coefficient of risk aversion is high. This occurs
when investors' uncertainty increases. The same factor also decreases the
dividend yield, thereby generating a positive relation between dividend yield
and expected returns. A very low dividend yield may be associated with a
negative risk premium (e.g., see Lamont (1998)).
Second, the empirical literature has had a hard time determining the relationship between expected returns and their conditional variance (see, e.g.,
Campbell et al. (1999) and Scruggs (1998)). Result (iv) justifies this finding:
Investors' fluctuating uncertainty over time about the true growth rate of
the economy makes this relationship ambiguous because it introduces a bias
that is at times positive (for low level of uncertainty) and at times negative
(for high level of uncertainty).
Third, the model developed in this paper assumes that investors have a
power utility function. This choice enables me to obtain a simple closed-form
solution for asset prices but it imposes also a specific relationship between
investors' degree of relative risk aversion and their elasticity of intertemporal substitution, the latter being the reciprocal of the former. This strict
relationship makes it more difficult to interpret exactly the comparative statics results obtained in this paper. Nonetheless, the basic intuition developed
in the model is likely to remain even under a more general utility function.
In fact, an increase in risk aversion would still imply that investors' hedging
demand for assets increases after bad news in dividends, thereby counterbalancing the negative pressure in prices due to the negative dividend news.
With a power utility function this effect is strong because a higher risk aver-

<-----Page 18----->The Journal of Finance

824

sion implies a lower elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which in turn
also increases the demand for the assets after negative shocks in dividends.
In fact, negative dividend innovations signal lower future consumption, which
in turn implies higher savings to smooth out consumption. The exact balance between the two effects can only be assessed by using a more general
utility function, such as Epstein and Zin (1989); this investigation is an
interesting topic for future research.
Finally, this paper investigates a particular type of quality of information:
information about economic growth. There are other types of information
that are certainly relevant and that are also worth investigating. These may
include information about future volatilities or correlations for example. The
effect of "information quality" on these variables may have different implications on stock returns than the one discussed here. Also, it would be interesting to study how information quality about different firms' growth
prospects affects their stock returns. The relationship between the cross section of returns and investors' information has been already addressed in the
Bayesian CAPM literature (see, e.g., Barry and Brown (1985)). However, a
model of intertemporal learning is still missing. One of the effects that we
can reasonably expect is that equilibrium "betas" would tend to change over
time as uncertainty fluctuates and investors' change their hedging demand
for stocks.
Appendix
Proof of Lemma 1: (a) This is a slight generalization to the vector case of
Theorem 9.1 in Liptser and Shiryayev (1977, p. 333). Let X(t) be an
N-dimensional Ito process described by
dX = udt + IdW,
where W(t) is an M-dimensional Brownian motion. It is assumed that the
N-dimensional vector , (t) follows an n state continuous-time Markov chain,

(e.g., see Karlin and Taylor (1975), p. 151). Both g and E can be functions of
X. Then, the proposition of Theorem 9.1 in Liptser and Shiryayev becomes:

The proof of this claim is identical to that of Liptser and Shiryayev's Theorem 9.1 after the obvious changes are made. Similarly, Liptser and Shiryayev's
Theorem 9.2 shows that under some technical conditions equation (Al) admits a unique nonnegative strong solution.
Finally, in order to obtain equation (5), we define X = (D,e)', ILi= (OiD,Oi)',

To conclude the proof of Proposition 3(b), notice that if mo > oD2 + 01 then,
from equation (A32), (dm*/de) > 0, and the result in part (i), a continuity
argument yields the result.
Similarly, if

where again y* is the upper bound of y implied by the condition (A14), then

Hence from equation (A32) and the result of part (ii), a continuity argument
yields the result.
(c) The result follows from LR = Y(O-2 + V0) and the fact that Vo
m0=
MO - 01 - mi. Indeed, if mo > oD2 + 01 by continuity there is a y such that
< 0 for y > j/. Moreover, for a given y, part (a) shows that a meanIR
preserving spread decreases V0. Hence, a negative risk premium can be obtained for a lower risk aversion coefficient when the distribution is more
diffused. Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 4: Part (a) is immediate from the fact that o-RsiS a parabola with respect to Vo and the fact that Vo is monotonic decreasing in y.
For part (b) the claims holds if 2 + (he + hD)V6 < 0 for a high enough y.
From the proof of Proposition 3(c), as y increases, Vo -- 01 - mo. Hence, by
continuity, it is sufficient to show that 2 + (h2 + h2) (01- _MO) < 0; that is,

MO- 01 > h2

This condition is satisfied if mo > o-D + 01 (the condition in Proposition 3(c))
whenever the expression in parentheses is less than one-that
is, when
