ABSTRACT
Legal decisions such as the decision to bail upon adjourning a case have major consequences for both defendants and society. In the English system, magistrates, most of
whom are lay people, are afforded considerable discretion and must work under constraints such as time pressure. Judgment analysis of the bail decision making policies of
81 magistrates from 44 courts throughout England and Wales revealed intra- and intermagistrate inconsistency in bail decisions, discrepancies between stated and elicited
cue use, and high levels of post-decisional con®dence. Furthermore, magistrates' policies were better described and predicted by a fast and frugal model characterized by
noncompensatory cue use, than by either of two compensatory integration models.
The fast and frugal model portrays a picture of bail decision making that con¯icts with
the ideal practice as de®ned by the due process model of justice. We discuss the implications of these ®ndings for judgment and decision making research and criminal justice policy. Copyright # 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Decisions made in the criminal justice system are regularly criticized by organizations supporting victims,
groups representing defendants and professional agencies such as the prosecution service. Criticism is directed both at existing legal rules and procedures and the individuals who are formally trained to apply them.
The motivation for such scrutiny lies in the belief that crime and order are socially constructed and so can be
reconstructed, and the realization that legal decisions have consequences for both the public purse and the
lives of the public.
Past psychological research on legal decision making includes studies investigating particular decisions
made by judges (e.g. Ebbesen and Konecni, 1975; Sensibaugh and Allgeier, 1996) and studies of jury decision making (e.g. Klevorick et al., 1984; Pennington and Hastie, 1981). Although both types of research
provide scope for challenging and changing existing legal rules and procedures, only the former can also
critique the performance of individuals who are formally trained and entrusted to apply them on a regular
basis.
Many published studies of legal decisions made by judges have tended to focus on decisions made in the
American criminal justice system. For example, Ebbesen and Konecni (1975) examined the information

used by San Diego County judges when setting bail. To our knowledge, judgment and decision making
researchers have not studied legal decisions made by judges in the English system. It may not be safe to
generalize the ®ndings of research from one jurisdiction to others because although the decisions may be
common to different systems, the legal rules and procedures, and the characteristics of the individuals trained
to apply them are often peculiar to a particular jurisdiction. For example, the bail decision (whether defendants should be allowed to `go free' until the next hearing of the case or whether they should be held in
custody) differs in the American and English systems.
In the present study we empirically investigate bail decisions made by individuals who are appointed and
trained to make these decisions in the English system. The bail decision has major consequences for defendants, their families, the criminal justice system and the general public (see Cavadino and Gibson, 1993). In
the past, research has been conducted by criminologists and they have highlighted concerns with, for
instance, the nature of the information used (e.g. Hucklesby, 1996; Simon and Weatheritt, 1974). We aim
to determine whether these concerns are still justi®ed and in doing so, we explore the potential impact that
judgment and decision making research can have on legal policy and practice. We hope that this will prompt
further studies of legal decisions made in the English system. Before highlighting criminologists' concerns
and describing the present study, we introduce the individuals who make bail decisions and describe characteristics of the decision making task. We then review the method of judgment analysis that is commonly
employed to investigate judgment and decision making in applied domains.
Who are the decision makers?
In the English system, around 98% of all criminal cases are dealt with from start to ®nish by magistrates; the
remaining cases are sent by magistrates to crown court for jury trial or sentence (Lord Chancellor's Department, 1999). The large majority of magistrates (99.70%) are lay magistrates who are not required to have any
formal legal training. They are given induction and basic training, followed by refresher training every three
years after that. Lay magistrates are members of the local community who are appointed to perform judicial
duties on a part-time, unpaid basis. The rationale behind the lay magistracy is that local justice be served by
local people. Although lay magistrates usually act as a bench of two or three, they are allowed to make bail
decisions alone. A very small minority (0.30%) of the magistracy are `stipendiary' magistrates who are
required to be legally quali®ed and have typically practiced law for a number of years. They are trained
for at least two years and they perform judicial duties on a full-time, paid basis. Stipendiaries can and usually
do act alone.
One of the most frequent tasks performed by magistrates is to decide whether to make a punitive or nonpunitive bail decision whenever a case is adjourned for subsequent trial, sentence or appeal. Magistrates must
decide whether to bail (release) a defendant unconditionally or react punitively by bailing with conditions
such as a curfew or remanding a defendant in custody (imprisonment). The purpose of the bail decision is to
ensure that the defendant returns to court for the next hearing of the case. In 1998, magistrates made decisions on around two million defendants (Home Of®ce, 1999). Many of the cases would have been adjourned
at least once during some point (Whittaker, et al., 1997), thus requiring magistrates to make a bail decision.
What are the characteristics of the bail decision making task and do they matter?
The law on bail
The magistrates' bail decision making task is governed and guided by the law on bail, namely the Bail Act
1976 (reproduced in Cavadino and Gibson, 1993) with its subsequent revisions. The law stipulates the principles upon which a defendant may be granted or refused bail and the conditions that may be attached when
granting bail. The law provides a general right to bail, except in some circumstances. (Note that bail may still
be granted at the court's discretion.) For example, bail may be denied if there are `substantial grounds' for

believing that a defendant may abscond, or offend, or interfere with witnesses/obstruct justice. The law also
states that in order to assess the risk of these events occurring, magistrates should `have regard to' information concerning the nature and seriousness of the offence, the likely sentence if convicted, the defendant's
bail record, if any, the strength of the prosecution case, the defendant's character, antecedents (previous convictions), associations and community ties, and any other factors that `appear to be relevant'. It is evident that
the law is vague and ill-de®ned. It is silent on exactly what information should be used and how that information should be weighted and integrated.
Availability of information
Numerous studies have documented the lack of information available to magistrates when they make bail
decisions (e.g. Dhami and Ayton, 1998, poster presented at the 1998 meeting of the Society for Judgment and
Decision Making, Dallas; Hucklesby, 1996; King, 1971; Morgan and Henderson, 1998). Background information such as the defendant's name, age and address, details of the current offence and any previous bail
decisions is provided on a courtsheet. Additional information may be provided by the prosecution and
defense on these matters and on other matters such as the defendant's previous convictions, bail history, community ties and personal circumstances. However, as Hucklesby (1996) observed, additional information
was provided in only one third of her sample of 1524 cases from three courts in Wales. The provision of
information is particularly important because the law on bail states that insuf®cient information is a ground
for a remand in custody. This allows the court time to gather further information on which to make an
informed decision.
In 1988, Bail Information Schemes were introduced in England and Wales to collect, verify and provide
information about a defendant's community ties. Studies evaluating these schemes have found that some
defendants are diverted from custody when magistrates are provided with such information (e.g. Lloyd,
1992; Stone, 1988). Thus, it seems likely that providing more information would lead to fewer punitive decisions. Research investigating the effects of missing information in other judgment domains supports the
assumption that missing information leads to negative decisions. For example, in a study on personnel decision making, Jagacinski (1994) found that, on average, missing information which was considered of average importance to the decision led participants to rate a candidate less favorably than comparable candidates
with complete information. Johnson and Levin (1985) found that in consumer decision making, less favorable evaluations were made of products as the amount of missing information increased.
Quality of information
When information is available, magistrates do not know how useful different information is in predicting
whether a defendant if bailed unconditionally will abscond, offend or interfere with witnesses. The relative
predictive validity of different pieces of information has not been objectively measured in any comprehensive way, and so is not available to magistrates when they make a bail decision. However, even if data were
gathered, it would at best provide only a partial measure of the objective predictive validity of the information. This is because it would never be known how many defendants who were imprisoned would have
offended if they had not been imprisoned. It is also impossible to measure exactly how many defendants
who were released on unconditional bail actually offended, as many crimes are not detected or reported.
Magistrates may learn the usefulness of different pieces of information from informal sources such as the
media's coverage of offending by defendants on bail. However, these sources are prone to bias and error.
Outcome feedback
An informal way of establishing the relative predictive validity of different pieces of information is for
magistrates themselves to gather outcome feedback after having made a bail decision on a case. For example,

they may realize that particular defendants whom they bailed unconditionally returned to court charged with
committing another offence. In the English system, there is no formal outcome feedback. Magistrates do not
know if they made an appropriate decision and this may restrict their ability to learn whether they are using
the right information in the right way. Learning from experience of the task is dif®cult (Brehmer, 1980), and
is also prone to bias and peculiar to an individual.
Court procedure
There are no statutory rules of procedure for bail hearings in the magistrates' court (Lydiate, 1987). Information may be presented in any order. However, it is not uncommon for a court to adopt a particular procedure and for speci®c information such as the offence the defendant is currently charged with, to generally
precede other information such as the defendant's previous convictions.
Evidence from the ®eld of judgment and decision making suggests that the order in which information is
presented affects the judgments made. Moreover, the effect is moderated by the amount of information that
is provided, the complexity of information and whether the response is made after each piece of information
is presented or not (Hogarth and Einhorn, 1992). Studies in other judgment domains have found evidence for
a primacy effect (Adelman et al., 1996) and a recency effect (Highhouse and Gallo, 1997). In their study on
legal decision making, Kerstholt and Jackson (1998) found that a recency effect occurred when participants
were required to respond after all the information had been provided and background information was also
available.
Time pressure
Magistrates are often faced with a heavy caseload and despite the lack of time limits this may lead to an
implicit feeling of time pressure. Evidence suggests that although over the past three decades the average
duration of a bail hearing has increased slightly, magistrates nevertheless make bail decisions rapidly (e.g.
King, 1971; Dhami and Ayton 1998; Doherty and East, 1985). Dhami and Ayton (1998) observed that in their
sample of 342 bail decisions made in two London courts, the duration of the bail hearings ranged from 50
seconds to 62 minutes, with an average of six minutes. They began timing cases from the moment the defendant stepped into the courtroom to take into account the accessing and processing of non-verbal information.
Research has revealed that time pressure affects human judgment in a number of ways. Davis and Davis
(1996) found that under conditions of time pressure individuals become more inconsistent. Individuals also
tend to switch to simple judgment strategies. For example, decision making strategies tended to be noncompensatory, that is, once a decision has been made further information cannot alter it (Ford et al., 1989). It has
also been demonstrated that individuals do not use all of the relevant information (Rothstein, 1986; Wright,
1974). Edland (1979) found that time pressure resulted in greater selectivity of information and greater use
of noncompensatory strategies. Recently, Rieskamp and Hoffrage (1999) reported that under conditions of
time pressure, individuals' judgments were better described by a simple, noncompensatory `fast and frugal'
strategy characterized by little information search and where decisions were based on only one piece of
information.
Work pattern
Lay magistrates work on a sporadic basis because each sits in court for a minimum of 26 half days a year (i.e.
a morning or afternoon every one or two weeks). This situation differs from the full-time duties of stipendiary magistrates. It is reasonable to assume that the difference in work pattern may lead to differences in the
consistency with which decisions are made between the two types of magistrate. Moreover, there may be
differences in the consistency of decisions made by more and less experienced magistrates. Although we

have found no studies directly comparing the effects of massed practice and distributed practice on performance in judgment tasks to support this assumption, studies of multiple cue probability learning typically
provide participants with blocked trials (e.g. Todd and Hammond, 1965). These studies demonstrate that
under conditions of massed practice participants can develop a relatively consistent judgment policy, in that
it can be adequately modeled (i.e. predicted). Thus, the implication is that both lay magistrates and less
experienced magistrates may show more inconsistency in their decisions.
Past research on magistrates' bail decision making
When studying magistrates' bail decision making, criminologists have evaluated magistrates' performance
against an ideal practice as de®ned by the due process model, which is synonymous with our notion of justice
(Packer, 1968). The due process model aims to reduce crime whilst minimizing the number of innocent people who are wrongly convicted, by setting procedural constraints. There is a presumption of innocence.
Magistrates are viewed as impartial adjudicators between the prosecution who represents the state and the
defense who represents the individual, and both parties are considered equal. All the court participants must
adhere to formal rules of procedure. Magistrates, for example, must carefully examine all the evidence, and
treat individuals fairly and without bias. This is not necessarily related to discovering the truth (or making the
`correct' decision). For example, a successful appeal against a decision to convict does not establish the
defendant's innocence; it merely states that the correct procedures were not adhered to. It is assumed that
if the function of the magistrates' court is to serve justice, then due process must be observed (King, 1981)
and due process ideals are often recommended as ways to regulate pre-trial decisions such as the bail decision (Galligan, 1987).
Criminologists have adopted sociological methods such as observations of bail hearings in the courtroom,
document analyses of court registers and criminal statistics, and questionnaires and interview surveys of
magistrates to investigate magistrates' bail decision making (e.g. Hucklesby, 1996). The large majority of
studies have tended to focus on bail decisions made in the adult magistrates' court where defendants are aged
18 years or over.
Criminologists have investigated the information used by magistrates when making their bail decisions
and differences in bail rates between courts. Although evidence has shown that magistrates respond to factors explicitly proposed by the law on bail such as the nature and seriousness of the offence (e.g. Doherty and
East, 1985; Jones, 1985; Hucklesby, 1996; King, 1971; Morgan and Henderson, 1998; Simon and Weatheritt,
1974), it has also been revealed that magistrates are sensitive to other factors. Studies have found that magistrates' bail decisions are associated with defendant-related factors such as race (see Fitzgerald, 1993), gender
(e.g. Eaton, 1987; Hucklesby, 1996; Simon and Weatheritt, 1974) and age (Jones, 1985; Simon and Weatheritt, 1974). According to these studies, defendants of ethnic origin, male defendants, defendants not ful®lling traditional gender roles and younger female defendants are all more likely to be treated punitively than
their counterparts. Second, there is evidence to suggest that magistrates' bail decisions are also related to the
earlier police bail decision (which is made after arrest before appearance at court) (e.g. East and Doherty,
1984; Jones, 1985; King, 1971; Morgan, 1994) and the prosecution request regarding bail (e.g. Doherty and
East, 1985; Morgan and Henderson, 1998; Zander, 1979). For example, Morgan (1994) reported that in 99%
of the cases in her sample where the police had decided to grant bail after charge, magistrates also granted
bail. Hucklesby (1996) found that magistrates agreed with the prosecution request 95% of the time. Finally,
there are differences in bail rates among courts that cannot be fully explained by the differences in the cases
presented, thus highlighting disagreement between magistrates (e.g. Jones, 1985; Hucklesby, 1996; King,
1971). The picture portrayed by criminologists differs from the ideal practice as de®ned by the due process
model.
Although the studies conducted by criminologists have high external validity because they are based on
real cases, they suffer from a number of limitations, including the fact that they do not control for the

inter-correlations that may exist between variables either at the design or the analysis stage of research. (In fact,
they do not always report the size of cue inter-correlations). This means that the effect of one variable such as
race cannot be discerned independently of the effect of another variable such as offence. Hucklesby (1996),
for example, made observations, analyses of court registers and questionnaire and interview surveys of
magistrates. She concluded that the prosecution request was `very in¯uential' in magistrates' bail decisions,
but she did not statistically disentangle the relationship between the prosecution request and other factors
such as offence. Some studies do not control for the information available to magistrates and so they can at
best only speculate as to the information attended to when magistrates made a bail decision. For example,
Jones (1985) conducted an analysis of the of®cial statistics on bail decisions and concluded that the police
bail decision was the `most signi®cant factor' in magistrates' bail decisions. He failed, however, to point
out that this information may not have been available to magistrates when they made their decision.
Finally, much of the criminological research on magistrates' bail decision making reviewed above was
conducted before some of the revisions were made to the Bail Act 1976. It is likely that magistrates' bail
decision making has been altered as a result of such changes; rendering much of the criminological research
`out of date'.
Researching human judgment and decision making
Judgment analysis
The method of judgment analysis, sometimes also referred to as policy capturing, has been widely used to
study judgment and decision making in a variety of applied domains such as education, medicine and
accounting (see Heald, 1991; Wigton, 1996; Waller, 1988, respectively). It has also been used to
investigate legal decisions made by judges in the American criminal justice system (e.g. Sensibaugh and
Allgeier, 1996). Studies have typically investigated individuals' consistency in making decisions, agreement
between different individuals' decisions on the same cases, their use of information, and their insight into
their own policies.
Judgment analysis involves asking individuals to make decisions on a set of cases that may be either real
or hypothetical and which comprise a combination of cues (information). Each individual's judgment policy
is then inferred from his or her behavior. This method attempts to avoid the pitfalls of direct report methods
such as interviews and questionnaires that are susceptible to social desirability response bias (Arnold and
Feldman, 1981) and inaccuracy in recall from memory and introspection (Wilson and Stone, 1985). Traditionally, researchers using judgment analysis have employed integration models such as multiple linear
regression to analyze the judgment data obtained (see Brehmer and Joyce, 1988). An individual's decisions
are regressed on the cues presented. Judgment policies are described in terms of the number and identity of
information used (i.e. cues with signi®cant weights), and how it is weighted (e.g. standardized beta weights)
and integrated (e.g. additive, compensatory rule) (Cooksey, 1996; Hammond et al., 1975).
The ability of a model to describe and predict individuals' judgment data is limited by their consistency in
making decisions because it is assumed that an inconsistent individual will be dif®cult to describe and predict. Researchers therefore have often presented individuals with a simple test±retest situation. In addition to
modeling judgment policies, researchers have examined individuals' insight into their own polices by comparing the model that describes an individual's implicit policy with his or her explicit statement of policy, as
elicited by a direct report method. It has been argued that direct methods provide an unreliable method for
demonstrating self-insight because of the dif®culties in articulating policies (e.g. Reilly and Doherty, 1992).
Therefore, in the present study, we consider a policy captured via such direct methods as a statement of an
individual's explicit policy, that which he or she is consciously willing and able to express to others, rather
than as an expression of insight. This is useful because legal decision makers are often asked to publicly
account for their decisions. Finally, often one of the goals of research is to improve existing judgment policies by providing cognitive feedback and/or decision aids (Hammond et al., 1975), and so one way of deterCopyright # 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

147

mining whether individuals will be amenable to such intervention is to measure their degree of postdecisional con®dence. High con®dence in a policy may imply an unwillingness to change it (Zakay, 1997).
Although there are some exceptions (see Brehmer and Brehmer, 1988), studies employing judgment analysis have generally yielded consistent ®ndings, irrespective of the number and type of decision makers
sampled and the nature and content of the judgment tasks studied (Brehmer and Brehmer, 1988; Libby
and Lewis, 1982; Slovic and Lichtenstein, 1971). The main ®ndings are that although over a set of judgments
individuals are inconsistent, their judgment policies can be adequately represented by an integration model
such as multiple linear regression, that contains only a handful of statistically signi®cant cues. Furthermore,
although there are inter-individual differences in policies, subgroups of individuals with similar policies
sometimes emerge. There are also discrepancies between the cues used as indicated by an individual's model
and his or her own explicit statement of cue use (which researchers often interpret as a lack of self-insight).
In addition, evidence from the ®eld of judgment and decision making in general has shown that where an
outcome criterion is known, individuals (including experts) appear highly con®dent in relation to their
degree of accuracy (see Zakay, 1997).
Criticisms of the regression model
Although judgment analysis has proved fruitful in investigating human judgment and decision making in
applied domains, researchers have questioned the use of regression models as descriptions of human judgment behavior (e.g. Dhami and Harries, in press; Einhorn, 1970, 1971; Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996;
Gigerenzer et al., 1999). Regression models are structural models that provide a static description of judgment behavior where the same information is used in the same way when deciding on each case. Although
cue weights may be noncompensatory and nonlinear terms may be included, it is generally assumed that
judgments are the product of a linear, compensatory integration of multiple cues that are weighted optimally
(Brehmer and Brehmer, 1988). However, the human mind is characterized by limited cognitive processing
capacity (e.g. Kahneman, 1973; Miller, 1956) and evidence demonstrates that judgment strategies are chosen
in relation to the structure and demands of the task (e.g. Billings and Marcus, 1983; Einhorn, 1971; Einhorn
and Hogarth, 1981; Hammond, 1996a; Hammond et al., 1987; Mertz and Doherty, 1974; Payne, 1982; Payne
et al., 1993). We have already presented studies that show, for example, how individuals switch to simpler
noncompensatory strategies under conditions of time pressure. Thus, one can question the psychological
plausibility of regression models.
Are there alternative models?
Some researchers have proposed static, structural, noncompensatory, nonlinear models. For instance,
Einhorn (1970, 1971) proposed the conjunctive model and the disjunctive model. In the former model, all
cue values must pass a speci®c threshold or cutoff point before a judgment is made at a speci®c level, thus
cue sums are not important. In the disjunctive model, the cue values of only one cue need to pass a cutoff
point before a judgment is made at a speci®c level. Brannick and Brannick (1989) proposed a version of
the scatter model. In a choice task, this model, in addition to taking into account the weighted sum of the
cue values, also takes into account the dispersion of cue values for each alternative. Therefore the pattern of
cue values is considered to be more in¯uential in making a judgment than solely the weighted sum of the
values.
Generally, these researchers have found that for at least some, if not all, of the individuals in their samples,
noncompensatory models provided a better ®t to judgment data than compensatory models (Brannick and
Brannick, 1989; Einhorn, 1970, 1971; Ganzach, 1995; Park, 1978). Einhorn (1970), for example, found that
predictions from the disjunctive model correlated more highly with two of his participants' judgments than
predictions from a multiple linear regression model or the conjunctive model. The conjunctive model better

predicted the judgments of one participant and the three models failed to predict the judgments of the fourth
participant. Cooksey (1996), however, points out that these models are not as parsimonious as the multiple
linear regression model and so do not cross-validate well. These alternative mathematical models are also
considered dif®cult for participants to interpret in studies aiming to improve judgment through cognitive
feedback of policies (Dhami and Harries, in press). As such, these models have attracted relatively little
attention from researchers using judgment analysis.
Process-tracing techniques have proved a popular alternative to regression analysis (see Juslin and Montgomery, 1999). Where regression analysis involves inferring information use from judgment behavior, process tracing involves either elicitation of verbal descriptions of information use, or identi®cation of the
information to which people attend by study of eye movement, information selection or reaction time data.
The resulting process models provide a step-by-step description of information use in terms of production
rules that are easy to understand. However, because the formation of these models is cumbersome, researchers focus on either modeling only one participant (Einhorn, et al., 1979) or modeling only particular tasks
(Billings and Marcus, 1983). The models may also be criticized for involving arti®cial methods to assess
what information is searched for, and for being vulnerable to the limitations of think aloud methods (e.g.
socially desirable responses and dif®culty in retrieving information from memory). These concerns raise
doubts about the reliability and validity of the description of judgment behavior provided by process-tracing
techniques (Payne et al., 1978).
Recently, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) proposed the use of process models, which they call fast and
frugal, and which, like regression models, are formed on the basis of the structural relationships between the
cues and judgment. Thus, they are not reliant on verbal protocols or arti®cial methods.
Fast and frugal models
Fast and frugal models are simple process models that do not search through all available information, do not
integrate all relevant information and base their decision on only one cue (Gigerenzer et al., 1999). Many of
these models are also noncompensatory. These models consist of principles for information search, stop and
decision making. For example, information search may be random or ordered and is limited by simple stopping rules such as stopping once the ®rst cue which discriminates between two alternatives in a choice task is
found, and so decisions are based upon one cue alone.
Studies have compared the ®t of fast and frugal models with compensatory integration models (including
regression models) on both simulated judgment data (Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer et al.,
1998, 1999) and human judgment data (Dhami and Harries, in press; Rieskamp and Hoffrage, 1999). The
former studies have evaluated the accuracy of the models in describing and predicting an outcome from statistical data (thus simulating judgments), whereas the latter studies have evaluated the models' ability to
describe human judgments made on a set of cases. The evidence reveals that fast and frugal models are
as equally good as compensatory integration models at correctly describing both simulated and human judgment data (Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer et al., 1998, 1999; Dhami and Harries, in press;
Rieskamp and Hoffrage, 1999). Moreover, it has been found that fast and frugal models are better at correctly
predicting simulated judgments on a new set of cases (Gigerenzer et al., 1998, 1999).
Rieskamp and Hoffrage's (1999) study involved inexperienced participants working under conditions of
time pressure. In contrast, Dhami and Harries' (in press) study involved participants who were trained and
experienced at making professional decisions. They compared the abilities of a fast and frugal model and a
logistic regression model's ability to describe doctors' prescription decisions on hypothetical cases. They did
not, however, compare the models' ability to predict doctors' decisions made on a new set of cases. In the
present study, we explore both the descriptive and predictive validity of a noncompensatory fast and frugal
model and two compensatory integration models, by modeling experienced magistrates' decisions to grant
bail on hypothetical cases.

The present study
The rationale for the present study was to discover if criminologists' past criticisms of magistrates' bail decisions in the English system are justi®ed and to describe the extent to which current practice differs from ideal
practice as de®ned by the due process model of justice. We used the method of judgment analysis to study
magistrates' bail decisions in the adult magistrates' court. The aims were to:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Measure each magistrate's test±retest consistency in making bail decisions
Measure agreement between magistrates' bail decisions made on the same set of cases
Measure each magistrate's post-decisional con®dence
Compare the relative ®t of different models, namely two compensatory integration models and a noncompensatory fast and frugal model in order to select the most valid descriptor and predictor of magistrates' bail decisions and
(5) Compare the policies described by the best-®t model with magistrates' own explicit accounts of their
bail decision making policies.
It is hypothesized that magistrates' bail decision making policies will be adequately described by a fast and
frugal model, as magistrates may be using simple strategies because in the courtroom they work under constraints such as limited time and information, and as humans they have limited cognitive computational
capacity. It is also hypothesized that the ®ndings of the extent of magistrates' consistency, agreement,
post-decisional con®dence and concordance between their implicit and explicit policies are likely to be compatible with the relatively stable body of ®ndings reported by previous research using judgment analysis.
METHOD
Participants
Two hundred and seventy booklets were distributed by mail to practicing magistrates sitting in a random
sample of 51 courts in England and Wales. The sampling frame was obtained from Shaw's 1996/97 Directory of Courts in the United Kingdom (Morris, 1996). Eighty-one magistrates from 44 courts, fully completed and returned the materials within the time limit. The 30% response rate is high for a postal survey
involving participants from a `closed group'.
The sample of magistrates who participated are considered to be representative of the magistracy in the
English system. Of those who chose to reveal their demographic characteristics, 70 were lay magistrates and
nine were stipendiary magistrates. Magistrates' experience on the bench ranged from six months to 35 years,
with a mean of 13 years. Forty-six magistrates sat in courts located in metropolitan areas and 32 sat in courts
located in provincial areas.
Bail decision making task
The bail decision making task consisted of a set of 41 hypothetical cases on which the participants made a
bail decision and then indicated their degree of con®dence in their decision. In the present study, nine cues
were manipulated (i.e. treated as the predictors in the models) and ten cues were held constant. The cues
were identi®ed on the basis of: (1) a review of the law on bail, (2) an analysis of a bail decision making
training package for lay magistrates (Miles and Thomson, 1992), (3) semi-structured individual interviews
with six lay magistrates, one stipendiary magistrate and two clerks to the justices (court managers), (4)
observations of 35 bail hearings in both lay and stipendiary magistrates' courtrooms and (5) a review of
the literature on bail. The nine cues, their values and the distribution of their values are shown in
Exhibit 1. Although some of these cues may not always be available to magistrates in the courtroom as mentioned earlier, their inclusion in the present study will provide us with evidence of their use when they are

Based upon the interviews with seven lay and stipendiary magistrates, the age cue was made categorical rather than continuous. In the
English criminal justice system, defendants aged under 21 who are remanded in custody are sent to young offenders' prisons, while those
aged over 21 are sent to adult prisons. Summary offences are mostly minor offences which are tried only in the magistrates' court,
indictable offences are mostly serious offences which are tried only in the crown court in front of a judge and jury and triable either-way
offences may be tried in either court. The speci®c offences chosen to represent each of these categories of offences were selected on the
basis of their commonality as indicated by the 1995 recorded crime ®gures in England and Wales, which were the most recent at the time
of design (Home Of®ce, 1996). A poor bail record may be de®ned as that where the defendant has absconded, offended or interfered with
witnesses whilst on bail in the past. The prosecution case against the defendant may be strong where details of witnesses and/or forensic
evidence are presented at the time of the bail hearing. Finally, a defendant may be considered to have weak community ties if he or she is
unemployed, does not have a ®xed address or any family ties.

available. The constant cues, such as the duration of the adjournment requested, were used to provide background information to the cases, while the values of the nine cues were combined to form the cases themselves.
Ultimately, we wanted to examine the effects of one cue on the decisions independently of the effects of
another cue. In theory this can be achieved at either the design stage using an orthogonal design or the analysis stage using partial correlations, for example. Correlation-based analysis such as hierarchical logistic
regression requires a large case to cue ratio (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996), which would mean that in the
present study at least 122 cases would be needed to study the nine cues. A pilot study on 20 law students
revealed that participants would be willing to complete a maximum number of about 40 cases. Magistrates
are also unlikely to volunteer for a time-consuming task. We opted to eliminate inter-correlations at the
design stage. In another study (in preparation) we collected data on the inter-correlations between the nine

cues studied here from observations of 342 real cases appearing in two courts. In one court there were only
four signi®cant correlations between the nine cues and in the other court only two signi®cant correlations
were found. Therefore, we feel that, at least in the present study, little has been lost in removing the cue intercorrelations.
In fact, orthogonal designs are commonly used in judgment analysis research (Cooksey, 1996). A complete combination of the cue values would have yielded an unmanageable number of cases (i.e. 232
333622  7776). Therefore, we decided to use a fractional factorial design. We used the orthogonal design option in SPSS version 7.5 for windows to elicit the smallest subset of possible cases while
simultaneously retaining the orthogonality of the cues. This yielded a set of 27 cases (the modeling set)
and created a main effects design. In similar circumstances other studies have taken advantage of techniques
that reduce the number of cases selected without comprising the orthogonality of the cues (e.g. Brown and
Allgeier, 1996). In addition, the program was used to select a further seven cases (the holdout set) that would
be used to validate the models ®tted on the modeling set. Finally, seven cases were randomly selected from
the modeling set and duplicated (although the names of the defendants were changed) to measure test±retest
consistency. Altogether that makes 41 casesÐabout the maximum we had established respondents would be
prepared to complete.
The cue values were equally distributed among the set of 27 cases for all cues except for the dichotomous
cues gender, age, prosecution case and community ties. Here, the unequal distributions re¯ected the realworld distributions. For example, there were more males than females in the set of 27 cases.
The cues were placed in the order as shown in Exhibit 1 and were in the same order in each case for ease of
reading. Despite the lack of procedural rules concerning the presentation of information, our courtroom
observations suggested that there was a general order for most of the cues that we were presenting. For example, as cases are not always heard in the order they are presented on the courtsheet, magistrates generally see
the defendant's gender and race upon his or her entrance into the courtroom when a case is called before they
learn of the offence he or she is charged with which is on the courtsheet. Although the cue inter-correlations
may not be realistic (Brunswik, 1956), the construct and face validity of the task were assessed by two magistrates. They compared the hypothetical cases to those presented in court and concluded that they were plausible. See the Appendix for an example of a hypothetical case used in the study.
The cases were presented in a random order to eliminate any order effects due to unfamiliarity with the
task and shifts in attention. The holdout cases were randomly intermixed with the cases in the modeling set.
The duplicate cases were placed at the end to restrict the probability of two identical cases being presented
one after another.
Participants were instructed to respond to the hypothetical cases by ®rst choosing a bail decision. The bail
decision options were unconditional bail, conditional bail (with the conditions speci®ed) or remand in custody. (The results of the conditions imposed will not be reported here.) Participants were then asked to
indicate how certain they were that they had made the appropriate decision based upon the information provided on an 11-point scale. Zero on the scale represented `absolutely uncertain' and 10 represented `absolutely certain'. These post-decisional con®dence ratings were requested for each decision individually rather
than for the set of decisions overall because cases differed in terms of the information provided (i.e. on the
cue values).
Ranking task
In order to capture magistrates' explicit bail decision making policies a direct ranking task was used. Cook
and Stewart (1975) found no difference in the results of direct tasks. Participants were asked to rank order the
nine cues according to the relative importance they attached to them when making bail decisions on the
hypothetical cases presented in the bail decision making task. A rank order of one indicated the most important cue.

Procedure
The bail decision making task was followed by the ranking task in a booklet format. The booklet also contained instructions that listed the cues and described the two tasks. Participants were instructed to
complete the tasks individually, to complete the bail decision making task ®rst, not to spend too much
time on each case and not to return to cases which had already been completed. Participants were also
asked to specify what further information, if any, they would have liked in order to make their bail
decisions in the bail decision making task. Participants' demographic details, namely type of
magistrate, location of court and number of years' experience on the bench were also requested. We
decided to measure magistrates' overall experience on the bench, rather than the extent of their experience
in making bail decisions in particular, because we felt that their sporadic work pattern may prevent accurate
recall.
A handful of booklets were sent to each court, addressed to the court manager who was informed of
the study and asked to distribute them to magistrates sitting in the courthouse. Magistrates' names and
addresses are not made public and so we were advised by the Magistrates' Association to gain access
to magistrates in individual courts via their managers (Bracey, personal communication, 1997). A covering
letter was included for magistrates, which introduced the study, guaranteed respondent's anonymity
and asked for volunteers to participate in the study. The three weeks deadline for returning the
completed booklets directly to the researchers was highlighted and a stamped, self-addressed envelope
was provided.
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The magistrates made from 2 to 23 unconditional bail decisions (mean  12.07), 2 to 25 conditional bail
decisions (mean  12.09) and 0 to 9 remand in custody decisions (mean  2.84), on the cases in the modeling
set.
Intra-magistrate consistency
Each magistrate's consistency in making bail decisions was measured by computing a Cohen's Kappa value
which corrects for chance. The decisions made on the set of seven duplicate cases were compared with those
made on their original counterparts in the modeling set. The Kappa value ranges from 0 (indicating that
agreement or consistency is no better than chance) to 1 (indicating perfect agreement or consistency). Fliess
(1981) suggests that a value of 0.40 to 0.60 is `fair', 0.60 to 0.75 is `good' and a value above 0.75 is `excellent'. For the whole sample, Kappa ranged from 0 to 1 (mean  0.69). The consistency of lay and stipendiary
magistrates was also compared. For the 70 lay magistrates only, Kappa ranged from 0 to 1 (mean  0.69). For
the 9 stipendiary magistrates, Kappa ranged from 0.09 to 1 (mean  0.74).
In order to assess the relationship between magistrates' consistency and their experience on the bench,
a Pearson's correlation was computed between these two variables, across the sample. A nonsigni®cant
correlation of 0.11 was found (one-tailed p > 0.05, n  79).1
Agreement between magistrates
In order to measure the extent of agreement (as de®ned by whether different magistrates make the same
decision on the same case), the percentage of magistrates who disagreed with the modal response on each

case was calculated. Researchers using judgment analysis traditionally measure agreement in terms of the
size of the correlation between two individuals' judgments made over a set of cases (Cooksey, 1996). The
measure used here is less cumbersome and is sensitive to the extent of disagreement shown on a particular
case. Others have similarly used a measure of disagreement based on consensus (e.g. Strauss et al., 1995).
There was disagreement between magistrates as to the decision to be made on each of the 27 cases in the
modeling set. This ®gure ranged from 4.90% to 50% of magistrates (mean  31.40%). Magistrates disagreed
with the modal response on from 4 to 25 cases (mean  14.95). Lay magistrates disagreed from the modal
response on from 4 to 25 cases (mean  14.96) and stipendiary magistrates disagreed on from 7 to 22 cases
(mean  14.89).
In order to examine the relationship between the number of cases on which magistrates disagreed from the
modal response and their experience on the bench, a Pearson's correlation was computed between these two
variables. A signi®cant correlation of 0.31 was found (two-tailed p < 0.05, n  79). A Spearman's rank
correlation was computed to examine the relationship between the extent of disagreement and the modal bail
decision made over the cases in the modeling set. A nonsigni®cant correlation of 0.31 was found (two-tailed
p > 0.05, n  27). There was no signi®cant correlation between the number of cases magistrates disagreed
with the modal response and their consistency in decisions (r  0.08, two-tailed p > 0.05, n  81).
Magistrates' post-decisional con®dence
For each magistrate, a Spearman's rank correlation was computed to examine the relationship between the
bail decisions made on the cases in the modeling set and the post-decisional con®dence ratings provided for
these decisions. For the whole sample, the correlations ranged from 0.72 to 0.57 (mean  0.25). The
correlation was signi®cant for 29 magistrates (two-tailed p < 0.05, n  27, N  75). For the lay magistrates
only, the correlations ranged from 0.63 to 0.57 (mean  0.23. Twenty-®ve correlations were signi®cant)
and for the stipendiary magistrates the correlations ranged from 0.72 to 0.23 (mean  0.44. Four correlations were signi®cant).
Mean post-decisional con®dence ratings in bail decisions made over the cases in the modeling set were then
calculated for each magistrate. For the whole sample these ranged from 6.22 to 10 (mean  8.31). For the lay
magistrates only, mean post-decisional con®dence ratings ranged from 6.22 to 10 (mean  8.27). The stipendiary magistrates' mean post-decisional con®dence ranged from 7.22 to 10 (mean  8.87). In order to examine the
relationship between magistrates' mean post-decisional con®dence and their consistency in decisions, a
Pearson's correlation was computed between these two variables, across the sample. No correlation was found
(r  0.00, two-tailed p > 0.05, n  81). There was also no signi®cant correlation between magistrates' mean
post-decisional con®dence and their experience on the bench (r  0.10, two-tailed p > 0.05, n  79).
Magistrates' bail decision making policies
The polytomous cues were dichotomized for ease of analysis and for each cue all non-italicized values were
coded as 0 and italicized values were coded as 1 (see notes to Exhibit 1). The dichotomization was based on
semi-structured individual interviews with six lay magistrates, one stipendiary magistrate and two clerks to
the justices, and so should re¯ect how magistrates may simplify the information presented in the courtroom.
The cue inter-correlations remained zero. The three bail decision options were also simpli®ed into a binary
decision, where unconditional bail represented a non-punitive decision and conditional bail or remand in
custody represented a punitive decision. Analysis of the frequency of the bail decisions made by each magistrate on the modeling set revealed that magistrates made a relatively equal number of punitive and nonpunitive bail decisions.
The bail decision making policy of each magistrate was modeled on the set of 27 cases. We aimed to
compare a noncompensatory fast and frugal model called the Matching Heuristic (developed by Dhami

and Ayton, 1998 for binary categorization tasks) with a compensatory integration model, in order to choose
which of these models best describes and predicts magistrates' bail decisions. Although we would have liked
to use a regression model such as logistic regression, this was not possible because of the low case-to-cue
ratio (i.e. 3:1). We therefore decided to use two of the other models used by Gigerenzer and his colleagues,
namely a differentially weighted integration model called Franklin's rule (also known as Prudential Algebra)
and a unit weighted integration model called Dawes' rule.2 Both these models provide characterizations of
judgment behavior similar to that provided by a regression model. Moreover, although both models do not
weight the cues optimally in the way the least squares method does in a regression model, for example,
studies have demonstrated that both models are excellent approximations to regression models in terms
of descriptive and predictive validity (Dawes and Corrigan, 1974; Cattin, 1978; Dorans and Drasgow,
1978; Einhorn and Hogarth, 1975; Gigerenzer et al., 1998; 1999; Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996; Schmidt,
1971; Wainer, 1976). Dhami and Harries (in press) found that there was no statistically signi®cant difference
between the ®t of the Matching Heuristic and a logistic regression model on doctors' prescription decisions.
They de®ned ®t in terms of the percentage of decisions correctly predicted by the models. We de®ne ®t similarly. In this sense, we do not consider the present study to be especially limited due to the inability to compare the Matching Heuristic with a regression model.
In the sections below we will ®rst describe the procedure for modeling magistrates' bail decision making
policies with each of the three models (Franklin's rule, Dawes' rule and the Matching Heuristic). All the
models were developed so that they aimed to predict a punitive decision and only predicted a nonpunitive
decision by default because this is the procedure followed by the law on bail. We then present the results of
the ®t of the models on the modeling set and the models' ability to predict magistrates' decisions on the seven
cases in the holdout set. The model that performed best on average across magistrates was accepted as the
description of magistrates' bail decision making policies.
Franklin's rule
In this model each cue was weighted according to its in¯uence on the decision. Then, for each case this
model multiplied the cue values by their weights and then summed them. (Where a case is made up of binary
cues, the cues can be coded 0 and 1 and so the sum is the sum of the weights alone for all cues taking a value
of 1 in the case.) If the sum was equal or greater than the threshold value then a punitive decision was predicted. If not, then a nonpunitive decision was predicted.
The cue weights were calculated by choosing the value on each cue that had the greatest proportion treated
punitively in the set of 27 cases. For example, if the proportion of males treated punitively was greater than
the proportion of females treated punitively, then the former proportion would have been the weight for the
gender cue. Cue weights could alternatively have been calculated using methods such as the likelihood ratio,
phi coef®cient and chi square. These methods take into account all the information (i.e. number of males
treated punitively or nonpunitively and number of females treated punitively or nonpunitively). The method
used in the present study also does this because column totals for each cue are the same for all cues as each
magistrate made a speci®c number of punitive and nonpunitive decisions.3 The threshold value was calculated by ®rst taking the sum of the cue weights for each of the 27 cases, then totaling these 27 sums, and then
dividing the total by the number of cases (i.e. 27). This is a reasonable method for calculating the threshold
value because each magistrate made roughly an equal number of punitive and nonpunitive decisions.
2

Gigerenzer et al. (1999) call these models Franklin's rule and Dawes' rule respectively, because the American statesman Benjamin
Franklin described the procedure for the former model and Robyn Dawes, a judgment and decision-making researcher, showed that
equal-weighted models provide good approximations to differential weighted models.
3
If we tried to optimize the weights through various techniques and recalculated the goodness of ®t the model would over®t the data, and
thus do worse at generalizing to the holdout set.

To provide a concrete example, we use magistrate-1's bail decision making policy as described by Franklin's rule to predict this magistrates' decision on case three in the modeling set. In this case the defendant was
male, an ethnic minority, 18±21 years old, charged with a triable-either way/indictable offence, the prosecution requested a punitive decision, he had no previous convictions and no/good bail record, the prosecution
case was weak, he had weak community ties and the police made a punitive bail decision. The weights
attached to the cues were as follows: gender(0)(0.72)  race(1)(0.67)  age(0)(0.67)  offence(1)(0.78) 
prosreq(1)(0.72)  pcbr(0)(0.73)  proscase(0)(0.78)  commties(1)(0.67)  polbail(1)(0.67). The sum is
3.51, which is less than the 3.52 threshold value calculated for this magistrate. Thus, in this case, Franklin's
rule would incorrectly predict that magistrate-1 made a nonpunitive decision.
Dawes' rule
In this model cues were unit weighted. For each case this model counted how many cues had the critical cue
value, and if the unit sum of these was greater than or equal to the threshold value, it predicted a punitive
decision. If not, it predicted a nonpunitive decision.
The critical cue value of a cue was de®ned as the value with the greatest proportion that had been treated
punitively in the set of 27 cases. For example, if the proportion of males in the set of 27 cases treated punitively was greater than the proportion females treated punitively, then the critical cue value for the gender cue
would have been male. The critical cue value was then given a weight of 1, while the other value was given a
weight of 0. The threshold was determined as in Franklin's rule.
As an example, on case three, magistrate-1's Dawes' rule sums to 5, which is less than the 5.89 threshold
value calculated for this magistrate. Thus, Dawes' rule would also incorrectly predict that magistrate-1 made
a nonpunitive decision.
Matching Heuristic
This model searched through K of the available cues in rank order of importance, looking for a critical value
on each cue that indicated a punitive decision. If a critical value was found the model stopped searching and
predicted a punitive decision. Otherwise, the model searched through the value of the next rank ordered cue.
The model continued this procedure until K cues had been searched. If by this time no critical value had been
found the model predicted a nonpunitive decision. For illustrative purposes, Exhibit 2 shows the bail decision
making process by a Matching Heuristic model where K  2.
The following three steps describe how the critical values on the cues, the rank ordering of cues and K are
determined for each magistrate. First, a critical value was de®ned as the value on a cue that was most frequently treated punitively in the set of 27 cases. For magistrate-1, for example, the critical value for the gender cue was male because this magistrate made a punitive decision on more male than female defendants.
Therefore, despite no explicit inclusion of base rates, the critical value was affected by the fact that there
were actually more males than females in the modeling set. If the absolute frequencies of the number of cases
treated punitively were equal among the values of a cue, then the value with the lowest absolute frequency
treated nonpunitively was chosen. The lowest absolute frequency in this situation would result in choosing
the cue value with the highest ratio of punitive to nonpunitive decisions. Where the absolute frequencies of
the number of cases treated nonpunitively were also equal, a critical cue value was chosen randomly. Second,
a cue-utilization validity was calculated for each cue and was de®ned as the proportion of cases with the
critical value that were treated punitively in the modeling set. For magistrate-1, for example, the validity
of the gender cue was de®ned as the proportion of male defendants who were treated punitively. The validities were then used to rank order the nine cues, where the ®rst rank was assigned to the largest validity. This
rank order indicated the order in which the model searched through the cues. Cues with a tied rank order
were placed in the order they were presented in the judgment task. Finally, in order to choose the maximum

number of cues for the model to search (K), the ®t of the model with all nine possible maxima was systematically tested on the modeling set. The model with the best ®t in terms of percentage of correct predictions
was chosen as the model of magistrates' bail decision making policy and where two or more models had the
same ®t, the more parsimonious model (i.e. the model employing the fewest cues) was chosen. Parsimony is
the hallmark of the fast and frugal approach, which emphasizes simplicity. As Exhibit 3 illustrates, a model
that looked at only one cue was the best ®t for magistrate-1. The Matching Heuristic stated that this magistrate only used the offence cue to make a decision; where a serious offence (triable-either way or indictable)
predicted a punitive decision and a summary offence predicted a nonpunitive decision. Thus, for case three,
magistrate-1's Matching Heuristic would only search for information regarding the offence and would correctly predict a punitive decision.

Exhibit 3. Fit of Matching Heuristic on modeling set for magistrate-1

A Matching Heuristic which searched through one cue only (out of a possible nine cues) (K  1) proved to
be the best ®t for 75.30% of the sample. K  2 for 21% of magistrates and K  3 for the remaining 3.70% of
magistrates.
Describing and predicting magistrates' bail decisions
Each of the three models was used to make a prediction ®rst on the set of 27 cases used to develop the models
and then on the set of seven holdout cases used to validate the models. As stated earlier, we refer to the
percentage of decisions correctly predicted by the models as `®t'. The binary nature of the decision to be
described and predicted implies that any valid model should be expected to perform better than chance (i.e.
predict more than 50% of decisions). Dawes' rule provided the best ®t on the modeling set for 9.90% of
magistrates, Franklin's rule proved to be the best ®t for 38.30%, and the Matching Heuristic proved to be
the best ®t for 32.10% of the sample. For the remainder of the sample either two or all of the three models

The superiority of Franklin's rule, however, diminishes when looking at the ®t of the models on the holdout set. Here, Franklin's rule was better than the other two models at correctly predicting the decisions of
14.80% of magistrates, while Dawes' rule was the best for 19.80% of magistrates, and the Matching Heuristic was the best for 33.30% of magistrates. Once again, for the remainder of the sample either two or all of
the three models were equally good at correctly predicting magistrates' decisions on the holdout set.

Exhibit 4. Results of ®t of Franklin's rule, Dawes' rule and Matching Heuristic on modeling set and holdout set

Franklin's rule (mean  73.57%) or Dawes' rule (mean  69.36%) on the modeling set. Moreover, the
Matching Heuristic proves to be better at predicting magistrates' bail decisions (mean  65.61%) than
Franklin's rule (mean  59.26%) and Dawes' rule (mean  62.96%), on the holdout set. Although Franklin's
rule does better than Dawes' rule at describing the data in the modeling set, it does worse at predicting the
decisions in the holdout set. Thus, we concluded that the Matching Heuristic model best captured magistrates' bail decision making policies.
Cues usage
The Matching Heuristic was used to elicit magistrates' cue use when making bail decisions. Cue use is
de®ned broadly as the number of cues searched (including the cue on which the decision is based) and so
this number may vary from case to case where K > 1. The mean number of cues used over the cases in the
modeling set was calculated for each magistrate. Across magistrates the mean number of cues used ranged
from 1 to 1.67 (mean  1.10).
When comparing the Matching Heuristic across magistrates, it was found that magistrates differed in
terms of the cues they used to make their bail decisions. Previous convictions and bail record was used
by 23.46% of magistrates, followed by offence, which was used by 22.22%. Prosecution request was used
by 19.75%, gender was used by 17.28%, police bail decision was used by 16.05% and strength of community
ties was used by 12.35% of magistrates. Finally, race, age and strength of prosecution case were each used by
6.17% of the sample, respectively.
Analysis of the critical value on the cues used revealed that for seven of the nine cues, those magistrates
using the cues, used them in the same direction. Here, with the exception of the strength of prosecution case
cue, the legal cues were used in the direction expected, and the `extra-legal' cues were used in the direction
reported by previous research. Four of the ®ve magistrates who used the race cue made a punitive decision
when the race of the defendant was described as white. Seven of the 10 magistrates who used the strength of
community ties cue made a punitive decision when the defendant was described as having weak ties.

Requests for further information
A total of 144 requests were made by magistrates for more information in response to the question of what
further information they would have liked in the set of hypothetical cases which would help them to make
their bail decisions. Fifty-seven percent of the requests were for further information regarding the nature of
the current offence such as time of the offence. Nineteen percent of requests were for more information
regarding the current bail position such as availability of bail hostel places, 9% were for more information
regarding the defendant's community ties and 7% were for more information on defendant related factors
such as the defendant's `lifestyle'. The remaining requests were for more information regarding the defendant's bail record and for court related factors such as the clerk's advice.
Comparison between Matching Heuristic and magistrates' explicit statements of policy
Although according to the Matching Heuristic none of the magistrates used all the cues, we were interested
in assessing magistrates' explicit consideration of cue importance for each of the nine cues. Therefore, the
rank ordering of the nine cues as described by the Matching Heuristic were compared with the rank ordering
of cues explicitly provided by magistrates in the ranking task. Kendall's tau-b correlations were computed
between each magistrates' implicit and explicit rank order of cues. The correlations ranged from 0.39 to
0.67 (mean  0.09). There were only two signi®cant correlations (2-tailed p < 0.05, n  9, N  81). For the
lay magistrates only, these correlations ranged from 0.39 to 0.56 (mean  0.08), and for the stipendiary
magistrates these correlations ranged from 0.22 to 0.67 (mean  0.13).
In order to examine the relation between the degree of concordance between magistrates' implicit and
explicit policies and their experience on the bench, a Pearson's correlation was computed between concordance and experience. A nonsigni®cant correlation of 0.10 was found (two-tailed p > 0.05, n  78). There
was also no signi®cant correlation between concordance and consistency in decisions, across the sample
(r  0.06, two-tailed p > 0.05, n  80).
For an indication of the cues that were ranked differently in magistrates' implicit and explicit policies, we
computed the mean rank order of each cue in both types of policies, across magistrates. Exhibit 5 illustrates
the concordance between magistrates' implicit and explicit rank ordering of cues summarized across all
magistrates. Note that the rank order of importance was reversed for ease of illustration, so a rank order
of nine represents the most important cue.

DISCUSSION
Bailing and jailing the fast and frugal way
We found that the majority of magistrates showed some inconsistency in their bail decisions. Magistrates
also disagreed as to the decisions to be made on the same cases. Nevertheless, all magistrates were highly
con®dent that they had made the appropriate decisions. Magistrates' bail decision making policies were better described and predicted by a fast and frugal model called the Matching Heuristic characterized by noncompensatory processing of information than by either of two compensatory integration models. According
to the Matching Heuristic, magistrates based their bail decisions on one cue and they differed as to the information they used. Some based their decisions on defendant and crime control-related cues. Finally, magistrates' explicit statements of cue use did not match that proposed by the models of their decision making
policies.
These ®ndings are based on individual magistrates' decisions and the use of hypothetical cases. Magistrates' bail decision making training packages comprise hypothetical cases similar to those used in the present study. The external validity of hypothetical cases has been questioned (Ebbesen and Konecni, 1980).
However, after reviewing 30 years of policy-capturing research, Brehmer and Brehmer (1988) concluded
`thus far, then, it seems that the paper format as such does not lead to any important distortions in the policies
obtained' (p. 89). Cooksey (1996) agreed with this conclusion after considering the internal and external
validity of studies using hypothetical cases. Both these reviews included research using paper cases that, like
those in the present study, involved hypothetical cases with orthogonal cues. We do not consider the present
study to be especially limited by the fact that we investigated decisions made by magistrates on hypothetical
cases consisting of an orthogonal cue set. Indeed, previous research suggests that, though people may claim
to use con®gural cues, incorporating such terms into models of judgment policies adds little, if anything, to
their descriptive validity (see Brehmer and Brehmer, 1988). In our interviews with magistrates during the
design phase of the present study, they did not report anything to suggest con®gural cue use.
By examining the in¯uence of each variable upon magistrates' bail decisions independently of the effects
of other variables, we have con®rmed criminologists' claims that magistrates are in¯uenced by defendant
and crime control-related cues.4 However, only a small minority of magistrates used the race cue and they
mostly used it in the opposite direction to that claimed by criminologists. One possible explanation is that
magistrates were sensitive to our research aims and so consciously avoided using this cue. A letter received
from the chairman of a bench of magistrates during the design stage of the study stated `it worries me that
you are bringing race into it. What does the color of a defendant's skin have to do with . . . the bail decision . . . ? I do hope you are not trying to prove that whites are given bail more frequently.' Although magistrates were provided with information regarding a defendant's community ties, only a handful of magistrates
used this cue, and when they did use it, the majority used it in the direction expected. This implies that Bail
Information Schemes providing this type of information to magistrates may not be as effective as has been
indicated in the past by observational studies for example. Future studies employing an experimental
approach may yield more reliable and valid ®ndings on this issue. The use of cues such as gender, age, race,
prosecution request and police bail decision, together with the requests for further information, reveal how
magistrates interpret the catch-all clause contained in the law on bail.
Perhaps not surprisingly, factors which are considered to be both socially and professionally undesirable
for making a bail decision such as defendant and crime control-related cues were ranked lower in magistrates' explicit statements of policies than according to the models describing their behavior. Statements

At ®rst sight, the ®ndings of our study may seem discrepant with those of Morgan (1994) and Hucklesby (1996), for example. These
criminologists' studies involve magistrates from a relatively small sample of courts in England and Wales, and their results are consistent
with the results we report for a small sample of magistrates from our much larger sample of courts.

made by magistrates and court managers during the data collection phase of the study supports our ®ndings.
For example, a clerk to the justices stated that `the physical appearance and the presence of the defendant . . . do make a difference'. In the present study we distinguished between what magistrates publicly state
they do and what they actually do. Konecni and Ebbesen (1984) suggest that these should also be distinguished from what legal decision makers privately think they do, which refers to the concept of self-insight.
Future research could investigate magistrates' insight into their policies by using policy recognition methods
like those advocated by Reilly and Doherty (1992).
It was also con®rmed that different magistrates disagree as to the decisions to be made on the same cases.
The extent of disagreement may be partly explained by the differences in the cues used and magistrates'
individual inconsistencies. The present study extended our understanding of magistrates' bail decisionmaking to include a measure of their individual consistency in their decisions and their post-decisional con®dence. The high level of post-decisional con®dence demonstrated by magistrates in the present study is
arguably inappropriate where magistrates were in disagreement with one another and where they were inconsistent. Despite the absence of an outcome criterion, we can assert that the extent of inconsistency and disagreement found indicates that magistrates are likely to make errors, for example releasing a defendant who
would abscond. In the same way that reliability is a pre-requisite for the validity of a psychometric test, consistency (whether it be within an individual or between individuals as de®ned by the measure of disagreement in the present study) is a pre-requisite for accuracy with respect to an individual's decisions. The extent
of inconsistency and disagreement between magistrates in the present study is surprising considering that
they were performing a structured judgment task and were presented with the same information, but unsurprising in the light of other research. It is likely that there will be greater inconsistency and disagreement in
the courtroom, where there are no rules of procedure, a lack of information, time pressure and an erratic work
pattern.
Although Hucklesby (1997) reported that stipendiary magistrates are more likely than lay magistrates to
disagree with the prosecution request and to remand in custody, our ®ndings con®rm evidence (Doherty and
East, 1985; King, 1971) that suggests there are no signi®cant differences between the two types of magistrates. Observed differences may be due to the fact that stipendiary magistrates deal with more serious and
complicated cases. Intra-individual inconsistencies and characteristics of the bail decision making task may
explain the lack of signi®cant differences in performance between the two types of magistrates and between
more and less experienced magistrates.
The present study differed from other studies employing judgment analysis because we tested the use of
alternative models as descriptions of judgment behavior. We found magistrates' bail decision making policies could be better represented by a fast and frugal model. Others have shown that people often use heuristics (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). Although we studied lay magistrates as individuals rather than as a
bench, empirical evidence has revealed that people use less cognitive effort, as indicated, for example, by the
number of cues they use, when under conditions of shared responsibility (Weldon and Gargano, 1985). Thus,
it is likely that the bench may also be fast and frugal.
The fast and frugal model does not search through all available information, does not weight information
in an optimal way, does not integrate all relevant information and bases its decision on only one cue. In this
sense, although the fast and frugal model is descriptively valid, it lacks prescriptive utility, because magistrates behaving in a fast and frugal manner are not observing due process requirements as they are currently
de®ned. The law on bail is silent regarding exactly what information magistrates should use and how they
should weight and integrate it. The due process model would require that magistrates do not use defendant
and crime control-related cues and they carefully search through all the available information and appropriately weight and then integrate the relevant information. This way of making a decision characterizes how
compensatory models such as regression models portray the judgment process. However, we have already
mentioned that human cognitive limitations and certain task characteristics may prevent individuals from
using such judgment strategies.

Implications for research in judgment and decision making
Gigerenzer and his colleagues have evaluated the prescriptive utility of fast and frugal models solely in terms
of their accuracy (this is often global accuracy). In many applied domains, such as the legal domain, however, accuracy is not the primary concern (Hammond, 1996b). Thus, as we have argued, although fast and
frugal models are descriptively and predictively valid, they may lack prescriptive utility.
In studying simulated judgments (or accuracy in predicting an outcome), the ef®cacy of fast and frugal
models has been attributed to their ability to exploit the redundancy stemming from cue inter-correlations in
the environment (Gigerenzer et al., 1999). In the present study, we examined a fast and frugal model's ability
to describe and predict human judgments made on a set of hypothetical cases comprising orthogonal cues.
We found evidence of noncompensatory, fast and frugal judgment strategies.
Previous research has shown that people use noncompensatory strategies under conditions such as time
pressure. The ®ndings of the present study are not limited to such conditions. Furthermore, although previous
judgment analysis research has shown that people use few cues, we have found no study that has reported
participants using only one cue, as we have found in the present study.
The cognitively simple strategy embodied in the Matching Heuristic is more psychologically plausible
than that characterized by the two static compensatory models. First, people are ¯exible in their use of information. The Matching Heuristic, like other fast and frugal models, indicates that the same cue is not used to
make a decision on every case, as it is in static models. Second, as we mentioned earlier, past research suggests that people may switch to noncompensatory strategies under conditions such as time pressure. Thus,
magistrates, and other professionals, may well be using simple strategies because they often work under such
conditions. Third, although Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) assumed an optimal learning strategy is
involved in the development of their fast and frugal model, the Matching Heuristic does not. It is more compatible than earlier fast and frugal models and the two static models presented here with evidence that people
are selective and use frequencies when they learn relations between cues and an outcome. The Matching
Heuristic uses frequencies when determining the critical cue value. It is claimed that this is a natural form
of processing (Cosmides and Tooby, 1996; Gigerenzer and Hoffrage, 1995). The way in which the Matching
Heuristic de®nes the critical cue values and the cue-utilization validities is compatible with research showing
how humans learn about and judge causation and covariation from direct experience (Nisbett and Ross,
1980). Evidence suggests that when humans learn about the relations between cues and an outcome they
look at only a subsection of the available information. For example, in the modeling set, the number of male
and female cases who were treated punitively and non-punitively can be put into a 22 table, and when
determining the critical value, the model looks at only the two punitive cells. When determining the validity,
the model only looks at the two cells of the value chosen as the critical value. Finally, the Matching Heuristic
embodies the principle of matching characteristics of individual cases with a prototype. This is consistent
with evidence from the ®eld of categorization (see Estes, 1994). From the above it is clear that if researchers
wish to develop psychologically plausible decision mechanisms, they should attempt to integrate evidence
from the broader context of psychology.
Despite the criticism that regression models are not psychologically plausible descriptions of judgment
behavior, the vast majority of judgment analysis research uses regression models. Researchers continue to
paint a complex picture of human judgment and they seem to have overlooked an indication that individuals
may be using simple strategies from the regression models themselves. This is the ®nding that usually only a
handful of cues (three on average according to Brehmer (1994)) are statistically signi®cant (see Brehmer and
Brehmer, 1988; Libby and Lewis, 1982; Slovic and Lichtenstein, 1971). A number of explanations for the
seemingly `ritualistic' use of regression models have been offered, including that they provide an adequate ®t
to data (Brehmer and Brehmer, 1988) and the tools to apply them are readily available (Stewart, 1988).
Although alternative models have been proposed, we have found no instance of researchers using judgment
analysis to investigate legal decision making or judgment in any other domain for that matter who have compared the relative descriptive validity of different types of models. This recently led Doherty and Brehmer

(1997) to conclude that `the conception of human judgment emerging from regression studies of human
judgment can be refuted only by evidence that shows that judgment is something other than a matter of combining pieces of information that are weighted according to their importance. So far, such evidence has failed
to materialize' (p. 547). We feel the present study has provided some evidence to this effect.
Moreover, as we have demonstrated, judgment analysis is not synonymous with the use of regression models. Researchers interested in legal decision making and judgment in other domains should reconsider their
use of these models. Perhaps we are ®nally witnessing a turning of the tide. For instance, recently, Kenneth
Hammond (1996b), a prominent judgment analyst who during his career has consistently used regression
models to investigate professionals' judgment policies, confessed that a `sin of commission on my part
was to overemphasize the role of the multiple regression (MR) technique as a model for organizing information from multiple fallible indicators into a judgment' (p. 244). Finally, in order to avoid a similar situation
regarding the future use of fast and frugal models, research should compare the relative descriptive and predictive validity of these models and other noncompensatory models.
Implications for the criminal justice system
As in previous research on legal decision making, the present study has shown that the current practice of
magistrates' bail decision making is far from ideal practice. Our ®nding contradicts how magistrates and
their managers believe the bail decision is made. For example, a lay magistrate wrote to us stating that
`the situation . . . depends on an enormous weight of balancing information, together with our experience
and training.' The chairman of the council stated `we are trained to question, and to assess carefully the evidence we are given.' In Konecni and Ebbesen's (1984) terms, these quotes highlight the `mythology of legal
decision making.' In the past, criminologists criticizing magistrates' bail decision making have tended to
focus solely upon fallibilities in magistrates to the exclusion of an analysis of the bail decision making task
that magistrates are expected to perform and the conditions under which they perform this task. Performance
is contingent on both human cognitive limitations and task constraints. Future research should examine the
effects of task conditions such as time pressure, order of information presentation and work pattern upon
magistrates' bail decisions. Although we did not study the effects of characteristics of the bail decisionmaking task upon magistrates' performance, previous research in other domains suggests that such characteristics will have predictable effects.
Therefore, interventions should focus on both the characteristics of the bail decision making task and on
magistrates themselves. As an example, we list a few of the possible interventions for change. The Bail Act
1976 could be better speci®ed. The catch-all category could be unpacked into its component parts and the
Act could incorporate a weighting scheme for the information that is informed by at least some objective
measures of the predictive validities of the factors. Thus, research needs to be directed at measuring
cue validities. (If statistical data could be collected and a decision rule could be formulated, it is conceivable that magistrates could be replaced by an automated system.) Magistrates' cognitive processing limitations could be overcome by providing them with a cognitive aid that helps them implement the law.
Cognitive aids have been recommended in other judgment domains such as psychiatry (Erdman, 1988),
and are not a new concept in the legal domain (Larsen et al., 1997). Statutory rules of procedure for bail
hearings could be introduced and time pressure could be reduced. Magistrates' consistency and disagreement could be improved by providing them with cognitive feedback of their own and other magistrates' bail
decision making policies, respectively. Cognitive feedback has been shown to be effective in other domains
such as medicine for example (Kirwan et al., 1983). Finally, although the accuracy of magistrates' bail
decision making was not directly measured in the present study, it is suggested that formal, objective
outcome feedback could help magistrates to develop an appropriate policy. These suggestions may be
relevant to other legal decisions and other jurisdictions where decision makers are afforded considerable
discretion and work under similar task conditions.

Any attempt to improve performance needs to take into consideration the idea that decision makers may
be reluctant to change. In the present study, magistrates' resistance to change may be indicated by their high
degree of post-decisional con®dence. Nevertheless, an awareness of the magnitude and signi®cance of legal
decisions such as magistrates' bail decisions may highlight the urgency with which practice needs to be
improved.
Recognizing the importance of legal decisions
The magistrates' bail decision has signi®cant consequences. For example, evidence suggests that defendants
who are remanded in custody in England and Wales are more likely to lose their homes, jobs and suffer loss of
reputation and deterioration in family ties (see Cavadino and Gibson, 1993; King, 1971). They are also more
likely to plead guilty, be given a custodial sentence and less likely to be acquitted than their bailed counterparts (e.g. Davies, 1971; Jones, 1985). This can be partly explained by the implicit presumption of guilt inherent in a remand in custody, the dif®culties in preparing a defense while in custody and the long duration spent
in custody awaiting trial. Remand prisoners place a ®nancial burden on the prison service (White, 1999) and
remand prisons are notoriously overcrowded and lack regime activities (Morgan and Jones, 1992). It is not
surprising that this circumstance, coupled with the uncertainty of knowing what the future holds, makes it
more likely for remand prisoners to kill themselves whilst in prison. In 1999, 64% (58) of the self-in¯icted
deaths amongst the English prison population were by remand prisoners (®gures provided by Suicide Awareness Support Unit, HM Prison Service, 1999). It has been argued that attaching conditions to bail such as
reporting to the police station, residing at a speci®c address or keeping curfew do not prevent offending, interference with witnesses or absconding (e.g. Block, 1990), but they do curtail a defendant's liberty. On the
other hand, if too many of the `wrong' defendants were released, the general public would be the victims
of offending on bail. A recent study by Brown (1998) found that 15% of those released on bail (unconditionally or conditionally) in his sample committed offences and 9% failed to attend court at least once.
It is clear that individuals who are trained and entrusted to apply legal rules and procedures must perform a
tremendous balancing act. They must protect the public while simultaneously respecting an individual
defendant's right to liberty. The lack of due process observed in magistrates' bail decision making raises
doubts about their performance on more complicated and less frequently made decisions such as the decision
to convict. Fortunately, our conceptions of crime and order are socially constructed and so the concerns
expressed by different groups in society regarding the appropriateness of some of the legal decisions made
have often led to speci®c changes in legal rules and procedures. Unfortunately, judgment and decision
making researchers, despite being equipped with the necessary tools, have tended to neglect legal decision
making, especially in the English criminal justice system. We propose that they, like criminologists, should
take the opportunity to challenge and change the system.

Below is a copy of a hypothetical case used in the present study:
The defendant Ravi Kumar is male, Asian, and 23 years old. He has been charged with in¯icting grievous
bodily harm. The police bailed him with sureties after he was charged. The prosecution has not objected to
unconditional bail. Ravi has one previous conviction for a similar offence, and has offended while on bail in
the past. The prosecution case against him at present does not seem particularly strong. He has a ®xed
