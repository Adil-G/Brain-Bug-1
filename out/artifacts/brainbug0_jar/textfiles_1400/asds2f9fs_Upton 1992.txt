Fisher's Exact Test

[Received May 1991. Revised August 1991]
SUMMARY

This paper reviews the problems that bedevil the selection of an appropriate test for the
analysis of a 2 x 2 table. In contradiction to an earlier paper, the author now argues the case
for the use of Fisher's exact test. It is noted that all test statistics for the 2 x 2 table have
discrete distributions and it is suggested that it is irrational to prescribe an unattainable fixed
significance level. The use of mid-P is suggested, if a formula is required for prescribing a
variable tail probability. The problems of two-tail tests are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

Barnard(1984) noted that 'argumentsabout 2 x 2 tables have now gone on for 70
years', while Cox (1984) describedthese argumentsas representing'a saga, a story
with deepimplications'.Barnardand Cox wererespectivelyproposingand seconding
the vote of thanksof the Royal StatisticalSocietyfor the paperby Yates(1984). Both
speakersprofferedthe hope that Yates'spaperwould, in the wordsof ProfessorCox,
'squashonce and for all variousmisconceptions'.However,despitethesewishes,that
paperhas by no meansbroughtthe discussionsof this contentioustopic to a halt. This
is evidencedby the flurryof recentpapersthat includethose by Haber(1986),Overall
et al. (1987), Rice (1988), Lloyd (1988), D'Agostino et al. (1988), Barnard (1989),

Little(1989),Camilli(1990),Richardson(1990),StorerandKim(1990)and Cormack
and Mantel (1991).
A decadeago I wrotea paper(Upton, 1982),frequentlyreferencedsubsequently,in
whichI madea case againstthe use of Fisher'sexacttest. The purposeof this paperis
to announcemy conversion,broughtabout by conversationswith ProfessorBarnard
and the stimulusof his recentpapers(Barnard,1989, 1990).The argumentfor the use
of the conditionaltest statisticis set out briefly in the next section. The subsequent
sections are concernedwith the associatedproblemsof significancelevels and tail
probabilities which have both helped in the past to confuse discussions of the
problem.
2. PURPLE FLOWERS,TEST PROCEDURESAND THE EXACT TEST

I find that Fisher'sexampleof the purpleflowers,recountedby Barnard(1984)and
set out at length in Table 3 of Camilli (1990), representsa clinching argument
concerningthe need for conditioning. A modified form of the same example is

[Part 3,

discussedby Little(1989),and a similarexampleis presentedby Cormackand Mantel
(1991).

The exampleis concernedwith a numberof plants (four in the originalexample)
each of which may, or may not, flower. The question at issue is the proportionof
plantsthat, on flowering,bear purpleflowers. The essenceof the argumentis that,
assumingthat floweringis independentof flowercolour, it cannotmakesensefor the
test to dependon the numberof plantsthat happento flower.
Barnard(1979)distinguishedbetweentests and test procedures,and it may help to
set out a possible test procedurefor this example. To make mattersmore realistic,
assume that there are 12 (rather than four) plants, and that the hypotheses are
H0:P(purple)= 0.5 and H1:P(purple)> 0.5. The proposedtest procedure,which
assumesthatthe nuisanceparameter7r,the probabilityof flowering,is independentof
the flower colour, is set out in Table 1.
When7r= 2, the overalltype I errorof this procedureis 0.036, when7r= 7 it is 0.046
and for 7r= 1 it reachesa maximumat 0.073. However,it is not theseoverallprobabilities that will concern the experimenter, but rather the relevant (conditional)
probabilitygiven in the final column of Table 1. The word 'relevant'here appliesto
the actualnumberof plantsthat happento flower. Once that numberis known, the
values in the other rows of the table are irrelevant.
The argument for the exact test exactly parallels that for the purple flowers.
Suppose,for example,that we areinterestedin the equality(HO),or otherwise(HI), of
the germinationratesof seedsfrom two differentsourcesand that six seedshavebeen
obtainedfrom each source. A possibletest procedureis set out in Table 2.
If the commonprobabilityof germinationis I, then this test procedurehas a type I
errorof 0.039, whereasthe chanceof a situationarisingin whichno decisioncan be
made is 0.146. This latter situation predominatesif the true value of the nuisance
parameteris near 0 or 1.
Commonto these two examplesis the preceptthat we would not considerthe performanceof a test procedurewith respectto its use in cases that have not occurred.
Indeed,if we wereto do so, then it wouldbe difficultto know whereto stop-should
we, perhaps, be aiming at a global significancelevel for all statisticiansover all
significancetests? This is patently absurdbut is, I regret, no more than a logical
developmentof my 1982argument.

3. SIGNIFICANCETESTSAND THE 5% TRAP
Part of the blame for the continuing controversy over the selection of an appropriate test procedure can be laid at the door of Fisher himself, since it was Fisher who
introduced tables with preselected tail probabilities for the x2-table 'owing to copyright restrictions' (Fisher, 1958). Since the introduction of these, and similar tables,
generations of statistics teachers have had to steer an uneasy line between the
convenience of the tables and the inevitable brainwashing of their students that arises.
Readers of this paper should need no reminding that an outcome associated with a tail
probability (measured in some agreed way!) of 0.0501 should be treated in essentially
the same way as an outcome that produces a tail probability of 0.0499. For all
practical purposes the two outcomes are equally 'significant'.
Barnard (1990) refers to 5% and 1Woas 'magic values' and gives an interesting
historical account of the development of the increasing 'significance' of significance.
Both Barnard (1990) and Camilli (1990) quote the remark by Fisher (1973) that
'no scientificworkerhas a fixed level of significanceat whichfrom yearto year, and in all
circumstances,he rejectshypotheses;he rathergiveshis mindto eachparticularcase in the
light of his evidenceand ideas'.
The experimenter must keep in mind that significance at the 5% level will only
coincide with practical significance by chance! There are therefore legitimate
conceptual reasons for departing from the 5Wolevel, in addition to the pragmatic
reason that it may be unattainable.
4. FLEXIBLEP-VALUES
The quote from Fisher in the previous section is, in effect, a directive to use
'flexible' P-values, varying from case to case. The determinants of this flexibility will
be associated with the actions consequent on the decisions that we take. A decision
that results in very costly consequences will not be taken lightly: the evidence will need
to be very persuasive.
A second determinant will be the sample size on which the decision rests, since this
will determine the power of the test procedure. Among others, Johnstone (1986) and
Barnard (1989) advocate reducing the tail probability judged as critical, as the sample
size increases. Both stress the need for flexibility in significance levels. McPherson

<-----Page 4----->398

UPTON

[Part 3,

(1989)also advocatesflexibilityin a valuableextendedcritiqueof the use of P-values.
Detailed prescriptionsfor varying significance levels in the analysis of multidimensionalcontingencytables have been advocatedby severalresearchers.Aitkin
(1979, 1980) proposes a simultaneoustest procedurefor testing null hypotheses
concerninggroupsof parameterswhichinvolvesglobal significancelevelsof between
25%oand 50%0and resultsin individualsignificancetests at manyintermediatelevels.
Raftery(1986)advocatesthe use of the Bayesianinformationcriteriondueto Schwarz
(1978)for the selectionof an appropriatemodel. This procedureresultsin a formula
that directlyrelates significancelevels to sample size. Supportfor this procedureis
providedby the work of Koehlerand Murphree(1988) and an exampleof its use is
providedby Upton (1990).
5. THE EXACT TEST IS NOT CONSERVATIVE!

Some of the recent papers on 2 x 2 tables begin with the statement, taken as
due to Yates (1934))is a conaxiomatic,that the exact test (or the X2-approximation
servativetest (e.g. D'Agostino et al. (1988)and Storerand Kim (1990)).Othershave
conductedstudiesof a varietyof contingencytablesand havethen come to that same
conclusion(Overallet al., 1987;Richardson,1990).Theselatterpapersaremerelythe
most recentin a long line of studieswhich includesUpton (1982). It is now my view
that all these papers are in error because they start with a preposterouspremise,
namelythat a test proceduremustbe definedto havea constantsignificancelevelover
all implementations.
As an example,considerthe approachthat I adoptedin my 1982paper.I askedthe
question 'Which of the competingtests, when employed at a nominal significance
level a, most nearlygives a truetype I errorequalto a?'. This echoedthe frequentist
approachof Neymanand Pearson. However,my concernwith this questionwas not
basedon theoreticalconsiderationsbut was purelypragmatic.I took the view that, if
usersof a test believethat it has a type I errorequalto a, thentheirbelief shouldnot be
too far from the truth. This led me to concludethat Fisher'sexact test and the close
approximationobtained using the Yates correction to the X2-test(Y) were not
appropriatebecause,in theirusual implementation,theiractualtail probabilitiesare
usuallymuch smallerthan the nominaltail probability.
However,therearetwo key phrasesnearthe beginningof the previousparagraph:
'nominalsignificancelevel' and 'if usersof a test believethat it has a type I errorequal
to a'. It is this idea of a pre-setsignificancelevel, whichis rarelyexactlyattainableby
the test statistic,that is the sourceof all the confusion. If we quoteonly the attainable
significancelevels consonantwith the particularset of fixed marginsfor the data at
hand then the exact test is not conservative.
Tocher(1950)showedthat the exact-test,augmentedwith an auxiliaryrandomization to achievea desiredsignificancelevel, wasthe uniformlymost powerfulunbiased
test. This augmentationwas describedas 'repugnant'by Mantel and Greenhouse
(1968). If we are contentto workwith achievablesignificancelevelsthen the need for
the auxiliaryexperimentdisappears,but it is then difficult to make sense of the
unbiasednessproperty.It is amusingto note that the much quoted case of the 2 x 2
tablein whichall four marginsareequalto 3 andin whichthe cell frequenciesare(3,0,
0, 3) correspondsto a conditional single-tailprobabilityof precisely5 Wo,without
recourseto randomization.

6. DISCRETEDISTRIBUTIONSAND MID-P

Most of the problemsthat arisein consideringtests for the 2 x 2 table arisebecause
of the inherent discretenessof any test statistic that we may wish to use (unless
augmentedby the 'repugnant'randomization).The discretenessis most apparentfor
the exact test but is equally true for all other test statistics. For example, with the
uncorrected'x2-statistic',the true distributionis not x2, but a closely approximating
discretedistribution.The idea of a tail probability,so transparentwhenconsideringa
continuousdistribution,becomes, for a discretedistribution,morebafflingthe more
that one pondersover it. For a continuousdistributionwe can happilycalculatethe
value of T(x), where T(x) = P(X ) x) and x is the observedvalue of the random
variableX. In this case, as required,E{ T(X)} = 0.5. However, when X is discrete,
E{T(X)} > 0.5, implying that the Fisher tail areas 'are "biased" in an upward
direction'(Barnard,1989).To correctthis problemLancaster(1949)suggestedthe use
of the mid-P-value M(x), given by
M(x)

=

P(X>x)

+ 0.5P(X=x).

(1)

Furthersupportfor the use of mid-P is to be found in Stone (1969)and Anscombe
(1981).
Thetest proceduresspecifiedin Tables1and2 werebasedon nothingotherthanthe
requirementthat the tail probabilitiesshouldbe reasonablyclose to 0.05. No rigorous
rule was used in their formulation. However, if this requirementis deemed to be
sensibleand a ruleis required,then mid-Pprovidesa convenientrule-one selectsfor
rejectionthose casescorrespondingto mid-Pvalueslessthan0.05 (Barnard,1989).As
it happens,the proceduressuggestedin Tables 1 and 2 satisfythis criterion.Barnard
suggeststhat mid-P may be thought of as 'assessingthe strengthof evidenceagainst
the null hypothesis'.Barnardalso observesthat, sincethe exacttest is freeof nuisance
parameters,it is simpleto computethe powerof a test procedureas a functionof the
odds ratio. An examinationof the power function may influence a decision concerningthe test procedureto be used.
7. YATES'SCORRECTIONAND THE EXACT TEST

My supportfor Fisher'sexact test might be construedas implyingsupportfor its
close approximator,Y, the Yates-correctedversionof the familiarX2-test.However,I
see a dangerinherentin the use of Ythat does not occurwiththe use of Fisher'sexact
test. This dangeris that the userof Ymay be seducedby the continuousnatureof the
x2-distributioninto forgettingthat Y is being used to approximatea sum of discrete
probabilities.It is then only a short step to forgettingthat the true type I erroris not
what it appearsto be!
8. MID-P AND THE UNCORRECTEDTEST

We begin by consideringthe general case in which Z is a continuous unimodal
randomvariablehavingthe samemeanandvarianceas a discretevariableX. Suppose
that we are interestedin the probabilityof exceedinga criticalvalue x, lying in the
uppertail of the distributionof X. Using the distributionof Z to approximatethat of
X, and using the continuitycorrection,we have the familiarresults

<-----Page 6----->400

[Part 3,

UPTON

and
P(X=x)

= P(x-

< Z < x) + P(x < Z < X+ 2)

(3)

In many cases, a reasonable further approximation is that
P(X-2

< Z<

X) = P(X < Z<X+

2)'

(4)

in which case
P(X=x)

= 2P(x < Z < x+

).

Combining equations (1), (3) and (5), we have
M(x) = P(Z > x).

(5)
(6)

These results treated a general case. In the specific instance of the 2 x 2 table, the
equality in equation (4) must be replaced by an inequality, since the density function
Of X2 is monotonically decreasing. For a two-tailed test the inequality works in an
opposite fashion in each tail. The two discrepancies from inequality largely cancel
themselves out, with the result that the use of mid-P is tantamount to the use of the
uncorrected X2-test.
Fortunately these discussions are becoming increasingly academic owing to the
increasing number of statistical packages that report exact tail probabilities. A
notable example is STATXACT, reviewed by Sprent (1990), which also reports midP-values.
9.

ONE-SIDED AND TWO-SIDED TESTS

Here we are faced with two contentious issues. First, can it make sense to perform a
one-tailed test? Second, if we perform a two-tailed test, how do we reconcile the
information from an observation in one of the tails with the probabilities (of events
that did not occur, but might have occurred) in the other tail?
The argument against the existence of one-tailed tests is that, although the experimenter may be anticipating, or hoping for, an outcome in one tail of the distribution,
he (or she) will surely not disregard an extreme result in the opposite tail. It may, for
example, draw attention to some defect in the test procedure.
However, Fisher clearly often used one-tailed tests when analysing 2 x 2 tables. In
1957, writing to E. B. Wilson, Fisher stated that
'[in the context of] the 2 x 2 table, when making an exact calculation I always use the single
tail, and if I want to compare significance with cases where both tails are used, I simply

doublethe valueobtained, withoutregardto the questionof how lumpythe othertail may
be [myitalics].Usually, indeed, I thinkthat the singletail is appropriate,thoughof course
not always'(Bennett, 1990).
We can reconcile these views by requ'iringthe experimenter to set out clearly his or
her test procedure before conducting the experiment. This has many benefits. It
avoids an unconscious bias on the part of the experimenter towards a choice of critical
region that conveniently includes the observed outcome! It also draws attention to
problems caused by small sample sizes: the hawk-owl experiment described by Rice
(1988) might not have been conducted if it had been observed that the most extreme
result gave a tail probability of 1/15-though any experimentation is better than
none. Finally, although the experimenter may be expecting, or hoping for, a result in

<-----Page 7----->1992]

FISHER'SEXACT TEST

401

one tail of the distribution, it forces him or her to consider the consequences of an
outcome in the opposite tail.
The previous quotation from Fisher shows clearly that he considered each tail as a
separate entity. In determining the form of the test procedure, we can presume that
Fisher would have considered each tail separately. How then would Fisher have
formulated a test procedure? It seems to me that, using either mid-P or the tail
probability, as appropriate, he would have made separate decisions for each tail concerning where, in that tail, he wished to draw the dividing line or lines between the
possible decisions.
Note that there may be a range of outcomes for the original experiment for which
the most appropriate conclusion may be that there is a need for the collection of
further data before a final decision is reached. In this context the paper by Berger and
Sellke (1987) on posterior probabilities is relevant, and we should perhaps take to
heart the view of Good (1987) in the ensuing discussion that
'the conventionalP value of approximately.05 [should]be correctlyinterpreted:not as a
good reasonfor rejectingHobut as a reasonfor obtainingmoreevidenceprovidedthat the
originalexperimentwas worth doing in the first place'.
10. SUMMARIZINGREMARKS
Although the primary concern of this paper has been with the 2 x 2 table, the ramifications extend beyond this specialized situation. For example, the issues raised by
unattainable significance levels apply to simple hypotheses concerning any discrete
distribution.
In effect we have evolved a general prescription for the method of conducting a
general significance test, based on the need to prescribe before conducting the
experiment the nature of the conclusions to be drawn from the possible outcomes of
the experiment. This might be thought to be standard practice-it is certainly an
uncontentious conclusion. Nevertheless, implicit in the thoughtless use of a fixed
but unattainable significance level in the context of 2 x 2 tables is an abuse of this
practice.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I wish to thank Professor Barnard for the conversations that stimulated the
production of this paper. To a considerable extent this paper plagiarizes his views
expressed in the papers referenced earlier, and I am grateful for his comment to the
effect that he is never averse to people repeating what he has been advocating! I am
also grateful to him for bringing to my attention the letter from Fisher to Wilson, cited
earlier. Nevertheless, despite the above, misrepresentations of facts or opinions are,
of course, my own responsibility. REFERENCES
