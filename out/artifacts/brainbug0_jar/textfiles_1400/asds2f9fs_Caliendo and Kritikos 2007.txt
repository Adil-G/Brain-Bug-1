ABSTRACT
Is Entrepreneurial Success Predictable?
An Ex-Ante Analysis of the Character-Based Approach*
This paper empirically analyzes whether the character-based approach, which is based on
the personality structure and the human capital of business founders, allows prediction of
entrepreneurial success. A unique data set is used consisting of 414 previously unemployed
persons whose personal characteristics were screened by different methods, namely a oneday assessment center (AC) and a standardized questionnaire, before they launched their
business. Results are partly unexpected: first, there is almost no correlation between the AC
data and the questionnaire. Second, the predictive power of the AC data is slightly better
than that of the questionnaire, but lower than expected in theory. Interestingly, for those
subgroups where the AC data have low predictive power, the questionnaire does better.
Third, when success is measured in terms of employees hired, the character-based approach
is a poor predictor.

Introduction

Entrepreneurship involves special kinds of decision-making processes. Because of this,
it is argued that the success of a business depends on the entrepreneur’s personality
structure, and that this is true in particular for previously unemployed persons. Failure
rates of entrepreneurs are high, and so are the costs incurred thereby: not only does failure
mean that entrepreneurs lose their own investments and the income opportunities they
could have taken advantage of otherwise; it may also mean that banks as well as ‘friends,
fools and family’ lose the capital they had invested (in terms of loans or equity); that
government agencies misallocate tax money to support these entrepreneurs through lumpsum payments (like the bridging allowance in Germany or similar support schemes offered
in other countries), free access to seminars, training or coaching or subsidized loans.1 The
decision to become an entrepreneur might open up a great chance to generate income,
but it might also mean an inefficient allocation of private and public money, not to speak
of the psychological costs of failure for the persons themselves. For these reasons, all
stakeholders are interested in the same question: Is entrepreneurial success predictable?
In this context, several psychologists and economists2 proposed that the personality of
the entrepreneur has a crucial impact on the success of a firm, in particular when the firm
is run by one entrepreneur alone or has only a few employees. Psychologists have identified several variables that appear to have a major influence on entrepreneurial success.
These variables deal either with the human capital, that is, entrepreneurial knowledge, or
with those personality characteristics that are important for developing entrepreneurial
skills, such as ‘need for achievement’, ‘locus of control’, ‘problem-solving orientation’,
‘interpersonal reactivity’ and ‘assertiveness’. These personality characteristics together
with entrepreneurial knowledge define the character-based approach. As most psychologists further assume that the personality of human beings consists of given traits that are
stable over time, it is expected that in particular the personality characteristics fulfill all
prerequisites of allowing prediction of future success.3

There is an ongoing discussion about whether these variables are indeed a ‘given set’ of traits determining the development of a person as an entrepreneur or whether these variables are influenced by the
working experience of a person as self-employed (see inter alia MacMillan and Katz, 1992). Empirical evidence in favor of the stability hypothesis has been put forward by Brandstätter (1997) and Müller (1999);

2

<-----Page 4----->The impact of these traits on entrepreneurship has been empirically tested in a number
of studies, particularly by making use of psychologically validated questionnaires (see, e.g.,
King, 1985). So far, ex-post tests have been conducted in two ways: by comparing the
traits of successful entrepreneurs with the same traits of either employees or unsuccessful
entrepreneurs. Both comparisons showed that there are significant differences between
the personalities of successful entrepreneurs and those of the other two groups.
In this paper, we investigate for the first time (to our knowledge) whether it is possible to predict the development of a business ex-ante by applying the character-based
approach. Furthermore, also for the first time, we use three independent methods of
examining the parameter values of the traits and of the human capital status for every
potential entrepreneur. The first is a questionnaire where participants have to answer
closed-ended questions; the second is an assessment method where participants carry out
specific tasks while psychologists observe their performance; and the third is a presentation of the business idea where information is gathered on the specific current human
capital of each entrepreneur in areas relevant to running a business. We have at our
disposal a data set from a business incubator in the city of Hamburg where these methods were applied simultaneously to screen individuals before they started a business. In
Section 2, we describe the assessment methods.
After explaining the screening methods, we will identify the variables assumed to be
crucial for entrepreneurial development. Research in particular in psychology but also
in economics has focused on those personality traits mentioned earlier in this section
as candidate variables. Hence, in Section 3 we will review those variables that can be
assumed to have an impact on the success of a potential entrepreneur.
In Section 4 we analyze our unique data set consisting of 414 business-founders who
were assessed and then received support from the business incubator in Hamburg. We
combine these data with a second, short questionnaire which only asked for actual employment status and the size of the business. On this basis, we are able to make two kinds of
analyses: we start by examining the correlations between the different assessment methods before we use an ex-ante test to investigate the extent to which these variables are
able to predict the prospective success of a business. Section 5 concludes our findings.
in favor of the socialization hypothesis by Blanchflower and Oswald (1998). While Brandstätter concludes
that personality differences may explain differences in entrepreneurial success, the latter authors declare
that ‘psychology apparently does not play a key role in determining who becomes an entrepreneur’.

Data Source: Business Founders in Hamburg

The source of our data is a ‘business incubator’ located in Hamburg. The main target
group of this incubator are formerly unemployed persons who are planning to found, own
and manage a new business under their own liability.4 The support offered through the
program consists of an ‘integrated concept’ covering a period of six months and offering
knowledge transfer combined with training and structured feedback on the initial work
undertaken by these entrepreneurs.5 Persons seeking this kind of support were sent to a
one-day assessment center (AC) where they met with two trained psychologists and two
laypersons. The purpose of the screening process was to allow the incubator team to
collect information about the candidates’ skills and the level of pre-existing knowledge at
the point of entry to the program.
In order to evaluate the basic entrepreneurial knowledge and skills of all applicants,
the AC uses three independent tools for the evaluation: a standardized questionnaire, a
presentation of the business idea by the applicant, and a number of structured exercises
where each applicant is assigned to certain roles allowing the psychologists to observe the
parameter values of the personality traits mentioned in the introduction.
The questionnaire consists of a paper-and-pencil test which was designed by Müller
(1999) based on the initial questionnaire of King (1985). It comprises five items for each
trait. The items have a sentence completion format where each applicant is required
to choose the one of the three response alternatives that best corresponds to his or her
own preferences. For each question, there is only one answer that matches the trait to
be tested. The more often the chosen responses correspond to the aptitude associated
with the respective trait, the higher the person’s test score. Test scores ranged between
0 and 5, with 0 (5) indicating that none (all) of the chosen alternatives were equal to
the trait-specific response alternative. We have access to data for four traits, ‘need for
achievement’ (Test 1), ‘locus of control (Test 2)’, ‘problem-solving orientation’ (Test 3)
and ‘assertiveness’ (Test 4). Details on these traits will be explained in Section 3.
The second screening method is similar to those used in traditional assessment cen4

The classification of our sample is close to the definition of entrepreneurship used by Hisrich (1990).
The only difference is that the persons we observe have not yet started their own business. At the point
of observation, they do not know for sure either whether they will indeed start their own business or
whether they will work alone or have other employees. For a discussion of the issue of how to correctly
define entrepreneurs, see for instance Brandstätter (1997) or Rauch and Frese (2000). Some definitions
assert that entrepreneurship only applies to firms having at least one employee in addition to the owner.

<-----Page 6----->ters. Here, three exercises were developed. In these exercises, participants were given
specific roles and had to solve pre-described problems within groups of four to five persons. While doing so, two psychologists and two laypersons examined the extent to which
the candidates exhibited certain personality traits such as ‘problem-solving orientation’,
‘assertiveness’ or ‘need for achievement’. Thus, the observers focused on the behavior
of the participants (not on the subject of the discussion). Instead of an indirect selfassessment, this second screening method is a third-party-assessment, where the third
party, if neutral and properly trained, translates the observed behavior into scaled parameters of personality traits. In the next section, we will present the variables for which
we have data based on the first method, a standardized questionnaire and the ones for
which we have data based on the second method, the psychological assessment.
Last but not least, the potential entrepreneurs had to present their business idea at
the assessment center. They were informed beforehand that they should provide specific
information about their concept, for instance the target group or market that the product
is aimed at, and the financial means needed to launch the business. Accordingly, this third
screening method, which again was used by the two psychologists, focused on parameter
values of entrepreneurial knowledge for each applicant.
Having clarified the method for gathering the variables of interest, we now describe
which variables were collected by each of the three screening methods and briefly analyze
why exactly these particular variables were chosen.

The Character-Based Approach

Theoretical analysis of the key factors of entrepreneurial success has been manifold. As
our empirical study concentrates on the predictive power of the character-based approach,
which is composed of the personality structure and the human capital of an entrepreneur,
we will limit our discussion in this section to the relevant models of entrepreneurial success.
It should be underlined that other important models exist as well that also analyze the
development of small firms, such as the business-oriented or the environmental approach.6
6
For overviews of the business-oriented approach, see, e.g., Porter (1981), Klandt (1984), Williamson
(1985), Picot, Laub, and Schneider (1989), Brüderl, Preisendörfer, and Ziegler (1992). There are various
empirical analyses of the business-oriented approach, see inter alia Blanchflower and Oswald (1998)
or Evans and Jovanovic (1989) who showed that the amount of available capital is correlated with
the success rate of a newly founded business. For some theoretical background and empirical analyses

Personality Characteristics and Entrepreneurship

In particular psychological but also economic research has analyzed in detail which personality characteristics are fundamental for entrepreneurial success. The following traits have
been defined as useful in explaining the past success and in predicting the future development of a newly founded business: motivational traits, such as ‘need for achievement’, ‘internal locus of control’, and ‘need for autonomy’, cognitive skills such as ‘problem-solving
orientation’, ‘tolerance of ambiguity’, ‘creativity’ and ‘risk-taking propensity’, affective
personality traits, such as ‘stress resistance’, ‘emotional stability’, and ‘level of arousal’,
and social skills, such as ‘interpersonal reactivity’ and ‘assertiveness’.7 Empirical research
aiming to underpin the theoretical propositions ex-post has taken two directions: it has
compared the parameter values of these variables, gathered with the help of psychologically validated questionnaires, either between entrepreneurs and employees, or between
successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs.
In the following, we will present the five most important variables (of those mentioned
above) for which previous research suggested the predictability of entrepreneurial success
from a theoretical and an empirical point of view and for which our own data set allows
us to make an ex-ante test.
The first (and most often discussed) variable to be analyzed is ‘need for achievement’.
It expresses the motivation of business founders to search for new and better solutions than
those given in the actual (market) environment, and their ability to realize these solutions
through their own performance in the market (see McClelland, 1961; Holmes and Schmitz,
1990; Lumkin and Dess, 1996). If a person is able to achieve such goals, it is said that
the achievement motivation of this person corresponds to the prerequisite of becoming a
successful entrepreneur. Significant differences with respect to this variable were found
between entrepreneurs and managers by Begley and Boyd (1987), Green, David, and
Dent (1996) and Müller (1999), and between successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs
by McClelland (1987) and Goebel and Frese (1999). Within the present analysis, the
on the environmental approach, see, e.g., Hannan and Freeman (1977), Brüderl and Schüssler (1990),
Sing (1990), Aldrich and Wiedenmayer (1993), Shane and Kolvereid (1995), Dean and Meyer (1996) or
Swaminathan (1996).
7
There has been extensive research on these variables in psychology. For thorough discussions of the
impact of these variables on the entrepreneurial success, see, e.g., Rotter (1966), McClelland (1961, 1985,
1987), Wärneryd (1988), Chell, Harworth, and Brearley (1991), Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon (1992), Furnham (1992), Brandstätter (1997), Rauch and Frese (2000), Müller and Gappisch (2005). In economics,
Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) as well as Holmes and Schmitz (1990) have made important contributions
relating to the variables of risk-taking propensities, and need for achievement.

6

<-----Page 8----->variable ‘need for achievement’ will be measured in two ways, by making use of Test 1 of
the questionnaire and by the evaluation based on the observations during the AC.
‘Locus of control’ (drawing on a concept of Rotter, 1966, and Furnham, 1986) measures
generalized expectations about internal versus external control of reinforcement. People
with an internal locus of control believe that they are able to determine their future
development through their own actions. Persons with an external locus of control believe
that their own behavior does not have any impact on their future outcomes, and that
success and failure is determined randomly, or by the external environment. Accordingly,
it is assumed that persons with an internal locus of control will be more successful as
entrepreneurs than individuals with an external locus of control. Empirical tests by King
(1985), Bonnet and Furnham (1991), Rahim (1996) and Müller (1999) found significantly
higher rates of locus of control for entrepreneurs than for managers. As to the comparison
of successful with unsuccessful entrepreneurs, Goebel and Frese (1999) report significant
differences. In the present study, the variable ‘locus of control’ will be assessed by making
use of Test 2 of the questionnaire.
‘Problem-solving orientation’ expresses the cognitive ability to act in a complex environment and to feel attracted to non-routine tasks. It enables an individual to understand
and solve existing problems by transferring knowledge into specific actions (see also Conrad, Müller, Wagener, and Wilhelm, 1998). Empirical evidence that a high value in
‘problem-solving orientation’ is correlated with entrepreneurship is found by King (1985),
Buttner and Gryskiewicz (1993) and Müller (1999). Within the present framework, the
variable will be measured by making use of Test 3 of the questionnaire and of the psychological evaluation during the AC.
‘Interpersonal reactivity’ describes the ability to put oneself in the place of another person. In the context of entrepreneurship, it expresses the ability to approach other people
and develop rewarding relationships with them (see, e.g., Bierhoff and Müller, 1993). It is
believed that a sufficient level of ‘interpersonal reactivity’ enables the entrepreneur to produce more client-oriented products, which is why this variable is related to entrepreneurial
success. Empirical evidence on this relation is found by Baron (2000). We will analyze this
variable by making use of the categorical variable ‘assertiveness/interpersonal reactivity’
which was extracted from the evaluation during the AC.
The final variable, ‘assertiveness’, expresses the ability to assert oneself and achieve

7

<-----Page 9----->one’s interests in a socially acceptable way. This variable is therefore complementary to
the previous one, ‘interpersonal reactivity’, and relates to the total performance of an
entrepreneur towards his clients and suppliers. It is assumed that if the ability to assert
oneself is sufficiently (but not excessively) high8 , the entrepreneur will be better able to
achieve planned profits. Also with respect to this variable, empirical studies revealed significant differences between entrepreneurs and managers (cf. King, 1985; Chell, Harworth,
and Brearley, 1991; Brandstätter, 1997; Müller, 1999). Within the present framework, the
variable ‘assertiveness’ is analyzed by making use of Test 4 of the questionnaire. Moreover,
as psychological research relates the variable ‘assertiveness’ to ‘interpersonal reactivity’,
both were measured during the psychological evaluation by making use of one categorical
variable (which combines assertiveness and interpersonal reactivity).9
Insert Table 1 about here
Table 1 displays the traits used in the present analysis, empirical findings from previous
studies, and the measurement methods applied. All five variables are expected to have a
positive impact on entrepreneurial success.
Psychological research has further clarified (for instance, in the so-called ‘GiessenAmsterdam Model’) why these particular variables are so crucial for entrepreneurial success. According to this model, these specific traits are expected to produce a strong
impact on planning the business and on the choice of strategies and actions during the
launching phase, which will in turn determine the entrepreneur’s eventual success in the
undertaking.10 Our overview of the existing empirical analysis showed that there are significant ex-post differences between entrepreneurs and managers and between successful
8

Winslow and Solomon (1987) described the optimal level of assertiveness as ‘mildly sociopathic’.
In this context it should highlighted that there is (in addition to these five) one further variable, ‘risk
attitudes’, which is deemed crucial for the development of a business (for empirical evidence, see e.g.,
Hartog, Ferrer-i Carbonell, and Jonker, 2002). Chell, Harworth, and Brearley (1991) as well as Klandt
(1996) assert, however, that it would be wrong to expect that risk-seeking entrepreneurs would have a
higher success probability. Business founders should always try to reduce their risks as much as possible
without becoming too risk-averse. The risk associated with a business opportunity should therefore be
of a medium range. Empirical research has also found that risk attitudes have a negative effect on
success beyond a certain point (cf. Begley and Boyd, 1987). Moreover, in a recent study it was shown
that the decision to become an entrepreneur is positively related to risk attitudes, but only if business
founders start out of regular employment (cf. Caliendo, Fossen, and Kritikos, 2006). For founders out of
unemployment, risk attitudes seemed to play no role, not even for the decision to become self-employed.
In the present study, we have no access to data with respect to this variable.
10
Of course, this relationship holds only if the person observed is also the source of the action (for more
details on the ‘Giessen-Amsterdam Model’, cf. Rauch and Frese, 2000).
9

8

<-----Page 10----->and unsuccessful entrepreneurs with respect to these variables.11
In the following, we will derive four hypotheses to be tested in the empirical analysis. Based on the theoretical approaches described and the previous empirical findings, we
start with Hypothesis 1, which tests whether, if properly assessed, entrepreneurs’ probability of business success will increase in proportion to the following personal characteristics:
1) ‘achievement motivation’, 2) internal ‘locus of control’, 3) ‘problem-solving orientation’,
4) ‘assertiveness’, and 5) ‘interpersonal reactivity’.
Our next hypothesis concerns the two ways of testing the variables, namely the psychological evaluation and the standardized questionnaire. In the cases where both methods
measure parameter values of the same variables, we state in Hypothesis 2 that there
should be significant correlations between the two test methods, as displayed in Figure 1
where the expected correlations are described.
Figure 1: Overview of the Set of Variables and Expected Correlations

Note: The factors entrepreneurial knowledge and entrepreneurial skills will be
explained in Section 4.2.

Previous research has also pointed out the limits of this approach. On the one hand,
the size of the firm in terms of number of employees has been described as indispensable
for the application of the model. According to this argument, the fewer employees a
11
There is one study explicitly testing whether other, more general variables also have predictive power:
Baum (1995) found that the variables studied here are more strongly related to entrepreneurial success
than more general variables (such as those used in the famous ‘big five’ test.)

9

<-----Page 11----->business has, the greater the impact of the owner’s personality on its success.
On the other hand, there is no consensus on the impact of personality structure on
entrepreneurial success. Müller (1999) suggests that these traits should be used to predict the development of an individual as entrepreneur. Given the numerous personality
variables that might influence entrepreneurial success, a second expectation is that each individual variable will only be a weak predictor for entrepreneurial success (cf., e.g., Rauch
and Frese, 2000). Gartner (1988) believes that no correlations will be found between traits
and the success of an entrepreneur at all because ‘the diversity among entrepreneurs is
much larger than differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs’.
It has therefore been suggested that correlations between all variables should be tested
for, and that factors be extracted (if a corresponding factor analysis allows us to do
so), enabling analysis of more general entrepreneurial personality trait dimensions (see,
e.g., Robinson, Stimpson, Huefner, and Hunt, 1991; Miner, 2000; Rauch and Frese, 2000;
Müller and Gappisch, 2005). Such approaches also relate to the more parsimonious trait
typologies used in the economic sciences, for instance by Lucas (1978), who focuses on entrepreneurial talent, or by Holmes and Schmitz (1990), who define entrepreneurial abilities
as crucial in distinguishing successful entrepreneurs from employees.
In our paper, we will, therefore, also test to what extent the personality variables are
correlated between each other and to what extent it is possible to extract factors from
these variables. Under the condition that we are able to do so, we state in Hypothesis
3 that the higher the factors extracted from the trait variables, the higher the business
founder’s probability of entrepreneurial success will be.

3.2

Human Capital and Entrepreneurship

Human capital theories relate to entrepreneurial success in a similar way as personality
structure: sufficient knowledge and working experience in the relevant fields enable business founders to choose more efficient approaches, for instance in organizing production
processes, creating financial strategies, or analyzing markets for the new product. The
human capital of the entrepreneur is the second part of the character-based approach
after the entrepreneurial personality.
Most theoretical studies analyzing the impacts of human capital on the success probability of a new venture are concerned with the general human capital (such as the years
10

<-----Page 12----->of schooling or working experience), with various kinds of specific human capital (such as
experience in leadership, in self-employment or in the industry chosen for the new venture), or with genetic or sociological relations (such as self-employed parents or friends).
Recent research on the impact of general human capital by Backes-Gellner and Lazear
(2003) has shown that it is important for later success if business founders have already
developed a broader knowledge base rather than specialized knowledge of a certain topic.
Relationships between the human capital approach and the success rates of entrepreneurs
have been empirically tested as well: Chandler and Hanks (1994, 1996) showed that there
is a positive impact when entrepreneurs found a new businesses in the same branch where
they had gathered previous work experience. The same authors observed only a weak
impact of general human capital on success rates in terms of years of schooling. An
explanation of the latter is given by Lazear (2004), and by Wagner (2003), who found
empirical support for Lazear’s ‘jack-of-all-trades model’ which is not necessarily correlated with years of schooling. Finally, Dunn and Holtz-Eakin (2000) found a positive
correlation between success rates of business founders and self-employed parents.
While most previous empirical research on human capital has been concerned with
general educational variables, in this paper we are able to analyze whether the specific
entrepreneurial knowledge of potential founders has any impact on the later success of
their businesses. We have access to four variables which relate to the actual level of specific human capital. As mentioned above, these variables were gathered by the psychologists during the presentation of the business idea. 1) We monitored whether business
founders had working experience in the branch of the planned business (basic competencies). 2) From the set of specific human capital variables, we observed whether the
business founders had knowledge of i) the financial background they will need to start
the business (presentation finance), of ii) the potential clients who should be willing to
buy the planned product (presentation clients), and of iii) the further financial needs in
subsequent years if the business should develop as planned (financial needs).
With respect to the predictive power of human capital, psychologists argue that variables describing the status quo of a person’s entrepreneurial knowledge are subject to
change, for instance through training, seminars and coaching. Therefore, Hypothesis 4
states that the level of human capital observed before starting the business is not correlated with later entrepreneurial success.

Empirical Analysis

In the present study, we make use of data on 414 applicants who went through the abovedescribed AC and founded their own firm in the business incubator in Hamburg. The
participants launched their businesses between 2001 and the beginning of 2004. In order
to assure no heterogeneity regarding support to the individuals, we restrict our analysis to
applicants who made use of the same kind of incubator service, which is briefly outlined
in Section 2.
In addition to the data from the AC, we collected information on the actual performance of these persons. The aim was to identify how many business founders were still
self-employed, how many had since accepted a position as a salaried employee, and how
many had become unemployed. Those who had started their own businesses were also
asked whether they had any employees. The data for this analysis was gathered through
telephone interviews carried out in the first quarter of 2005.
Insert Table 2 about here
Table 2 contains some summary statistics on the variables available, which we will
describe in Section 4.1. The first column refers to the whole sample of participants.
Since we expect that the economic development of entrepreneurs differs between older
and younger as well as between men and women, we analyze these groups separately:
columns 2 through 5 differentiate the sample by age and gender. One shortcoming of the
data is that we do not know the actual age of the individuals: only whether they are
above or below 30 years old. As can be seen in the table, men are over-represented in
our sample in the same relation as they are in the total population of entrepreneurs in
Germany (see Caliendo, Kritikos, and Wießner, 2006).
After a short overview of the descriptives of the data, we will start our empirical
analysis in Section 4.2 with an examination of the standardized test variables and of
the assessment conducted by the psychologists. In doing so, we aim to test whether the
observed parameter values of the variables in the questionnaire correspond with those of
the psychological assessments. In Section 4.3, we test the predictive power of the different
variables (tests and assessments) on two distinctive outcome variables: the employment
status and number of employed persons in the newly founded business.

12

<-----Page 14----->4.1

Set of Variables and Some Descriptives

Table 2 provides an overview and some summary statistics on the available information.
We will briefly discuss each variable and its distribution in the data. We start with
the standardized tests described in Section 3. Four test variables were used, with a
scaling from 0 to 5, where 5 indicates the best and 0 the worst result possible. The first
variable reflects the applicant’s ‘achievement motivation’, the second his or her degree of
possessing an ‘internal locus of control’, and the third reflects the applicant’s ‘problemsolving orientation’. The fourth test is a measure of the applicant’s ‘assertiveness’. It is
interesting to note that all tests are fairly equally distributed among the four subgroups.
The fourth test is the one where applicants achieve the lowest test scores. The average
values and variances of all four test scores (also the one on assertiveness) correspond
perfectly to previous empirical findings (see Müller, 1999).
The rest of the variables articulate the evaluation by two psychologists (who were
assisted by two laypersons) on different scales while observing the performance of the
applicants during the presentation of their business ideas and during the exercises.
The first block of variables analyzed at the AC dealt with the applicant’s businessspecific human capital. ‘Basic competencies’ is scaled as 0(=no) or 1(=yes) and 94 percent
of the participants in the incubator fulfilled this requirement. ‘Presentation: finance’ is
scaled on a choice set of 1(=no), 2(=partly) and 3(=very well). This variable is equally
distributed among the four sub-samples at a value of 2.1. ‘Presentation: clientele’ is scaled
on the same choice set as presentation finance and the average assessment is 1.94. Here,
young people scored worse than average (while older people did better). ‘Financial needs’
is scaled as 0(=no) or 1(=yes), where 41 percent of all applicants had a concept of how
to finance their business in the future, with a lower rate for women at 35 percent.
The second block of variables analyzed at the AC dealt with personality traits: the
need for achievement, interpersonal reactivity, assertiveness, and problem-solving orientation. ‘Need for achievement’ and ‘problem-solving orientation’ were each measured on
a scale from 1 (weak) to 3 (strong). The average value was for the former 1.8 and for
the latter 1.95 (both intermediate). ‘Assertiveness’ and ‘interpersonal reactivity’ were
measured by one categorical variable. A value of 1 reflects weak assertiveness and weak
interpersonal reactivity (24% of the sample), 2 reflects weak assertiveness and strong interpersonal reactivity (36%), 3 strong assertiveness and weak interpersonal reactivity (27%),
13

<-----Page 15----->and 4 well-balanced assertiveness and interpersonal reactivity (12%). It is interesting to
note that younger people received higher scores on the variable interpersonal reactivity
and older persons higher scores on assertiveness.

Correlation Analysis — Standardized Tests versus Psychological Assessments

Table 3 contains pairwise correlation coefficients of the four standardized tests and the
five psychological assessments. To increase the visibility of the results, we only included
coefficients that are at least significant at the 10 percent level; a star indicates significance
at the 5 percent level.
First of all, the upper part of the table reveals correlations between the variables
gathered in the questionnaire. The lower part shows that the variables measuring personal
traits and those measuring the entrepreneur-specific human capital were also correlated.
We further checked the correlation of the variables for the subgroups discussed before.
The results can be found in Tables A.1 (men/women) and A.2 (Age below/above 30 years)
in the Appendix and show that the high correlations within the two assessment methods
hold true for all subgroups in almost all cases. There is only one exception for women
showing that for the questionnaire data tests 1 and 4 are negatively correlated.
We made a factor analysis and extracted a factor labeled ‘entrepreneurial skills’
from the variables ‘achievement motivation’, ‘assertiveness/interpersonal reactivity’, and
‘problem-solving orientation’.12 We were able, as well, to extract a second factor, ‘entrepreneurial knowledge’, from the variables ‘presentation: clientele’ and ‘presentation:
finance’ (see also Figure 1). Since the same holds true for the standardized test, we made
use of a cluster analysis to condense the information to a dummy variable dividing the
observations into two groups (with high and low overall test scores).
Insert Table 3 about here
Coming to the analysis of Hypothesis 2, the expected correlations between the two
tests, we found rather surprising results: only the variables ‘problem-solving orientation’
and ‘presentation: finance’ are correlated with the standardized test variables 1, 2 and
3, although on a low level of around 0.09. Thus, as the third test should measure the

<-----Page 16----->individual’s problem-solving orientation, we observe only one correlation with the psychological assessment in the way it was expected in Figure 1. ‘Test 1 and Achievement
Motivation’ as well as ‘Test 4 and Assertiveness ’ are not correlated.
When analyzing correlations of the variables for the subgroups (see again Tables A.1
(men/women) and A.2 (below/above 30)) we found more mixed results: for individuals
older than 30 years, we found the most positive correlations, namely for two combinations
‘Test 1 and Achievement Motivation’ as well as for ‘Test 4 and Assertiveness’. Curiously,
for people younger than 30 years the same (and some further) combinations are negatively
correlated. The differentiation by gender produces no further insights.
Thus, these observations lead to two conclusions. The high correlations within each
of the two assessment methods allows us to extract two factors from the assessment
center data, and to make a cluster analysis of the test scores based on the questionnaire.
Due to the low correlations between the two assessment methods there is no support for
Hypothesis 2.
It seems that standardized tests and psychological assessments measure parameter
values that are (in the overall data set) independent of each other, and in some subgroups
positively, in others negatively correlated. Recent research points to a possible explanation
for diverging results, namely a perception bias: Arenius and Minniti (2005) argue that
the self-assessment of entrepreneurial skills might be biased and Köllinger, Minitti, and
Schade (2005) offer first evidence that business founders are not immune to overconfidence
when making a self-assessment of their entrepreneurial skills. Even if the questionnaire is
an indirect self-assessment, the possibility cannot be ruled out that there was a perception
bias among the business founders, in particular among the younger ones where we found
negative correlations.13 We will return to this point in the following section.

4.3

Analyzing the Success of the Start-Ups

We analyze the predictive power of the variables with respect to two distinct outcomes.
In a first regression, we check the influence of the variables on the employment status of
the individuals as recorded at the time of the interview. To be specific, we estimate a
13

Table 2 reveals that for the two variables ‘need for achievement’ and ‘assertiveness’, which are negatively correlated among the younger entrepreneurs, the self-assessment in the questionnaire was on
average almost the same as for the older subgroup while the AC data showed lower parameter values for
the younger entrepreneurs in comparison to the older ones.

where y 1 can take on the values self-employed (y 1 = 1), regular employed (y 1 = 2)
or unemployed (y 1 = 3). X is a vector of explanatory variables which we define further
below and the coefficients β are the ones we are interested in.
A further measure that we want to analyze relates to the success of the entrepreneur
in terms of employees.14 Therefore we construct an outcome variable which takes on the
value 1 if the self-employed person has at least one employee at the time of the interview
and 0 otherwise, i.e.,

yi2 =



 1 if

 0

Employees ≥ 1

otherwise

Hence, we can use a binary logit model for estimation. For the estimation of the two
outcome variables we employ five sets of explanatory variables X. In Specification 1 we
only exploit the standardized test scores, whereas in Specification 2 we exclusively use
the psychological assessments. Specification 3 combines both sets of explanatory variables. In Specification 4 we implement the reduced variables from the factor and cluster
analysis. Finally, in Specification 5 we include the reduced variables from Specification 4
and add two more explanatory variables concerning entrepreneurial knowledge. Table 4
summarizes the strategy.

Table 5 contains the estimation results of the multinomial logit model for the whole
sample and Table A.3 in the Appendix shows which coefficients were significant for the
four subgroups.15 The coefficients have to be interpreted in relation to the base category,

There is an ongoing discussion on the question of success measurement in the entrepreneurship
literature. We chose the two measures employment status and hired employees for the following reasons.
The variable employment status corresponds to previous ex-post analysis of the character-based approach
and, thus, allows a comparison of our findings with previous results. The variable hired employees covers
the crucial question of whether real entrepreneurship starts only if the firm owner hires additional persons.

<-----Page 18----->which in our case is unemployment. This means that a positive coefficient in the upper
half of the table indicates a variable’s positive influence on the probability of being in
self-employment (compared to unemployment). The results in the lower part refer to the
status regular employment.
Insert Table 5 about here
Table 5 shows that with respect to Hypothesis 1 there is one variable ‘assertiveness’
among the four tests of the questionnaire that has a significant effect in Specification 1. A
higher score for this variable increases both the probability of being in self-employment and
that of being in regular employment (relative to unemployment). Table A.3 reveals that
this impact is observed for the subgroups of female and younger entrepreneurs. Moreover,
‘need for achievement’ is a second variable in the questionnaire data that is significant in
the female subgroup.16
Using only the psychological assessments in Specification 2, we do not find any explanatory power for the model. That is, for the complete sample, none of the variables
generated by psychological assessment are significant at a conventional level. Table A.3,
however, illustrates that ‘problem-solving orientation’ has a significant impact for male
and younger entrepreneurs and ‘strong assertiveness’ for male and older entrepreneurs.17
Combining both sets of variables in Specification 3 confirms the positive influence of the
variable ‘assertiveness’ for the questionnaire data and also reveals a positive influence of
the variable ‘problem-solving orientation’ for the psychological assessment.
A particularly interesting result with respect to Hypothesis 1 can be found in Specification 3 for the four subgroups (see again Table A.3), namely that ‘assertiveness’ is the
only variable which has a significant impact in all four subgroups, with the two screening
methods—psychological assessment and questionnaire—working in a complementary way.
We have shown in Section 4.2 that the variables collected through psychological assessment are highly correlated between each other, and have conducted a factor analysis
to condense the information to two factors ‘entrepreneurial skills’ and ‘entrepreneurial
knowledge’. We were also able to carry out a cluster analysis of the survey data. The
results with respect to Hypothesis 3 are presented in Specification 4 showing that the

Older individuals now have a significantly lower probability of being in self-employment and regular
employment.
17

17

<-----Page 19----->factor ‘entrepreneurial skills’ has a positive influence on the probability to be in selfemployment (and also on the probability to be in regular employment). Its explanatory
power is increased in Specification 5, where we added two more independent variables
(which themselves proved not to be significant). As to the subgroups, we find that the
correlation between ‘entrepreneurial skills’ and self-employment holds again only for two
subgroups: men and older persons. In contrast, the cluster variable of the test scores based
on the questionnaire remains insignificant for all specifications and in all subgroups.
Besides the tests on the predictive power of personality characteristics, we also aim
to find out whether the status quo of entrepreneurial knowledge has any explanatory
power for an entrepreneur’s later development (Hypothesis 4 ). The estimation results
are again shown for the whole sample in Table 5 and for the subgroups in Table A.3.
For the complete sample, Specifications 3 and 5 reveal that none of the four variables
(presentation clientele and finance, financial needs and basic competencies) has any significant impact. Similarly the factor ‘entrepreneurial knowledge’ extracted from the two
presentation variables showed no predictive power on entrepreneurial success.18
With respect to the subgroups, it should be pointed out that for the female subgroup,
a high score in the variable ‘presentation clientele’—the entrepreneurs’s knowledge about
potential future clients—was positively correlated with the success variable. Even more
interesting, for the male subgroup, we observed negative correlations between the factor
entrepreneurial knowledge and entrepreneurial success.
The last findings needs to be commented. The negative significance of the factor
entrepreneurial knowledge on self-employment observed for the male subgroup does not
allow for the conclusion that male entrepreneurs will be more successful the less they
know. As these persons started their business in an incubator with intensive training and
coaching, this observation rather indicates that such training is able to compensate for a
lack of entrepreneurial knowledge before the business was founded.
At the end of our empirical analysis, we will return to one important question mentioned briefly at the beginning of this paper: firm size in terms of number of employees,
and the impact of personality characteristics on firm size. In most entrepreneurship research it is argued that real entrepreneurship starts only when the owner of the firm
18

Interestingly, high levels of entrepreneurial knowledge previous to starting a business significantly
increased the probability of later returning to regular employment but had no impact on self-employment.
It seems that other employers also have an interest in this kind of knowledge.

18

<-----Page 20----->hires at least one employee. Entrepreneurs are thus often distinguished from firm owners
without any further employees, who are then classified as simply self-employed persons.
The advantage of our data set in comparison to the earlier empirical analysis is that
we had access to the personality characteristics of potential founders before they started
to run their own business, thus, before they knew whether they would one day have
employees. Therefore, when it comes to firm size, we are able to make an analysis of our
data without a normative distinction within the population of self-employed persons.
We subsequently analyze the success of the start-ups in terms of the number of employees. The descriptives in Table 2 showed that in our sample, roughly 30% of the former
incubator clients had at least one employee at the time of the interview.19 Table 6 contains
the results for the same five specifications discussed earlier in this section. The coefficients
now have to be interpreted in the sense that entrepreneurs with at least one employee are
compared with the base category, i.e. self-employed without further employees.
Insert Table 6 about here
Interestingly, Table 6 shows that neither the variables derived from the questionnaire
nor the psychological assessment of the personality characteristics, nor the human capital variables, nor the two factors extracted from the psychological assessment, nor the
cluster variable derived from the test scores of the questionnaire show any significant
differences between entrepreneurs with and those without further employees. The level
of entrepreneurial skills and knowledge of business founders measured before their firms
were launched seem to be the same, irrespective of the later size of the firm measured in
terms of employees.
This result makes clear that other personality traits (if any) than those considered here
might drive the decision to hire additional employees once a firm has been founded. As the
prerequisites for managing others are found more in traits in the category of managerial
skills (see, e.g., Miner, 1997), we may conclude that the character-based approach is not
likely to make any prediction of whether a fairly high-skilled entrepreneur will run the
business alone or employ others.
Putting all the results with respect to Hypotheses 1, 3 and 4 together, we may conclude
that among the personality characteristics believed crucial for entrepreneurial success,
19

This corresponds to the overall share of previously unemployed entrepreneurs with further employees
in their own business. For more details, see Caliendo, Kritikos, and Wießner (2006).

19

<-----Page 21----->there is one variable—assertiveness—which proved to have a significantly positive impact
on entrepreneurial success in all four subgroups, but only if the assessment methods are
put together. Secondly, focusing on the entrepreneurial personality structure in a more
general way, it showed that the factor entrepreneurial skills had some predictive power,
while the factor entrepreneurial knowledge did not. Last but not least, the characterbased approach is not able to distinguish consistently between entrepreneurs with and
those without further employees.
With respect to the first finding—the impact of assertiveness—in all four subgroups,
we need to return once more to the correlation analysis of the previous section: the two
assessment methods were negatively (positively) correlated for the variable assertiveness
in the subgroup of young (old) participants, and we suggested that younger persons might
tend to be overconfident with respect to their skills. The present analysis, however, shows
that the psychological assessment had some predictive power where the two methods
were positively correlated (namely for the older persons) while the questionnaire had
some predictive power when the two methods were negatively correlated. The latter
observation shows that we do not necessarily have to deal with overconfidence and that
in this case psychologists might have tended to underestimate younger entrepreneurs.
Before concluding, we should highlight one final result that proved to be more stable
than any other variable in this analysis. The negative influence of the age dummy (both
for self-employment and regular employment) remains significant over most specifications
even when we differentiate between entrepreneurs with and those without additional employees. This result tells us that younger persons have a higher probability i) of remaining
self-employed after making this decision and ii) of employing further persons when selfemployed. They also have a higher probability iii) of returning to regular employment
when they stop being self-employed for whatever reason.

Conclusions

The aim of this study has been to investigate the predictive power of the character-based
approach. To do so, we collected information on those personality traits of potential business founders that were identified by psychological research as crucial for entrepreneurial
success. We had access to data - before businesses had been launched - on the following
20

<-----Page 22----->variables: ‘need for achievement’, ‘locus of control’, ‘problem-solving orientation’, ‘assertiveness’ and ‘interpersonal reactivity’. Most parameter values of these variables were
collected by making use of two assessment methods: a closed-ended questionnaire and a
one-day assessment center (AC) where trained psychologists conducted the analysis. In
addition, we obtained information about the status quo of the specific entrepreneurial
knowledge of the business founders.
We analyzed the extent to which each individual personality trait and the specific
human capital as well as some extracted factors allow predictions of entrepreneurial development. Our results are surprising in part: first, there was almost no correlation between
the two assessment methods. Second, among the observed variables of the psychological
assessment, we found correlations for the complete data set, particularly between the extracted factor ‘entrepreneurial skills’ and entrepreneurial success, but for almost no single
personality trait. Third, as to the test scores, the cluster analysis was insignificant, but
the variable ‘assertiveness’ showed a positive impact.
Previous ex-post research found that the variables ‘need for achievement’ and ‘locus
of control’ (more than the other three variables analyzed here) were positively correlated
with entrepreneurial success. Our ex-ante analysis found no such correlation. Instead,
we showed that the variable ‘assertiveness’ had an impact on the overall data analysis
and in the four subgroups that we analyzed as well. Interestingly, the latter result was
revealed only after making simultaneous use of both assessment methods. We furthermore
found that the status quo of entrepreneurial knowledge had no predictive power. This
observation is less surprising given that participants went through intensive training after
the assessment. In this respect, it seems more important to emphasize the increasing
significance of the factor ‘entrepreneurial skills’ as we added two variables referring to
entrepreneurial knowledge. This combination reveals that it might be important for future
research to focus on cognitive skills that make it possible to combine entrepreneurial
knowledge with existing traits.
There are several further results that should be highlighted. Persons who started their
own business but later returned to a position of a salaried employee after having been
offered a—possibly more attractive—job had the same level of ‘entrepreneurial skills’ and
were different from those persons who are still running their own business only insofar as
the employees took higher values with respect to the variables on entrepreneurial knowl-

21

<-----Page 23----->edge. More importantly, for the subgroup of the entrepreneurs who had hired additional
employees in their firm, both assessment methods found no significant differences when
this subgroup was compared to entrepreneurs working alone. The last finding has two
consequences: 1) The level of entrepreneurial knowledge and skills seem to have no impact on the decision whether the owner of the firm will employ further persons or not.
2) As the variables above discussed are considered crucial for entrepreneurship, the frequently proposed distinction between ‘real entrepreneurs’ (with further employees) and
small-business owners without further employees has to be reevaluated. The two groups
cannot be differentiated with respect to their personality characteristics, at least when
observed before businesses were launched.
These findings allow us to draw several conclusions. First, the predictive power
of a specifically designed assessment center is slightly better than the questionnaire.20
Moreover, this study makes clear that it might be useful to combine both methods—
psychological assessment by well trained third parties and self-evaluation through a validated questionnaire (as was done at the incubator in Hamburg)—and to use this information to improve decision-making processes on whether to become an entrepreneur.
However, predicting entrepreneurial success based on these two assessment methods is not
possible at this time. Moreover, for potential founders who aim to start a larger business,
it seems that further skills in addition to those observed here would be crucial as well.
The results of the character-based approach remain below the expectations raised by
entrepreneurship theory. Nevertheless, it is worth analyzing whether the two assessment
methods, when combined, are a better predictor of entrepreneurial success than the scoring
models currently used by banks. From a general point of view, our analysis leaves open
whether the right variables were identified to capture entrepreneurial behavior, whether
the observed variables are stable over time, whether support measures like an incubator
service have an impact on the personality structure, and whether the methods of assessing
potential entrepreneurs need to be improved. On another note, further measurements of
entrepreneurial success have to be developed. To this end additional research is needed.

20

This observation is interesting as research on the predictive power of the two assessment methods in
the field of employment mostly found the opposite, see, e.g., Schmidt and Hunter (1998).

(a)
The coefficients from the multinomial logit model have to be interpreted in relation to the base
category, which is unemployment in our case. The first sign in each cell corresponds to selfemployment, the second one to regular employment. For example, the combination (0/+) in the
last column of line 1 means, that the variable achievement motivation has no significant effect on
the probability to be in self-employment (relative to unemployment) but increases the probability
to be in regular employment (relative to unemployment).
