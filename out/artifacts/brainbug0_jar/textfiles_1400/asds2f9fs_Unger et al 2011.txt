The study meta-analytically integrates results from three decades of human capital research in
entrepreneurship. Based on 70 independent samples (N = 24,733), we found a signiﬁcant but
small relationship between human capital and success (rc = .098). We examined theoretically
derived moderators of this relationship referring to conceptualizations of human capital, to
context, and to measurement of success. The relationship was higher for outcomes of human
capital investments (knowledge/skills) than for human capital investments (education/
experience), for human capital with high task-relatedness compared to low task-relatedness,
for young businesses compared to old businesses, and for the dependent variable size
compared to growth or proﬁtability. Findings are relevant for practitioners (lenders, policy
makers, educators) and for future research. Our ﬁndings show that future research should
pursue moderator approaches to study the effects of human capital on success. Further, human
capital is most important if it is task-related and if it consists of outcomes of human capital
investments rather than human capital investments; this suggests that research should
overcome a static view of human capital and should rather investigate the processes of
learning, knowledge acquisition, and the transfer of knowledge to entrepreneurial tasks.

1. Executive summary
For more than three decades entrepreneurship researchers have been interested in the relationship between human capital –
including education, experience, knowledge, and skills – and success. A number of arguments suggest a positive relationship
between human capital and success. Human capital increases owners' capabilities of discovering and exploiting business
opportunities. Human capital helps owners to acquire other utilitarian resources such as ﬁnancial and physical capital, and it
assists in the accumulation of new knowledge and skills. Although a positive relationship between human capital variables and
success is well established, uncertainty remains over the magnitude of this relationship as well as the circumstances under which
human capital is more or less strongly associated with success. To date, the literature remains fragmented with studies differing
in the conceptualization of human capital, the choice of success indicators, and the study contexts such as industry, country, and
age of the business. We address the human capital — success relationship by systematically reviewing the literature and metaanalytically estimating the overall relationship between human capital variables and success. Moreover, we look at speciﬁc
conceptualizations of human capital attributes to test whether or not they differently relate to business success. We propose that
human capital is most important for success if it consists of current task-related knowledge and skills. Finally, we analyze

moderators of the human capital — success relationship by, investigating contextual conditions under which human capital is
particularly important, and analyzing the relationship between human capital and different success indicators.
We use meta-analysis to estimate the effects of human capital on success. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative estimate of a
variable relationship on a population level. It allows for the correction of statistical artifacts such as sampling error, and allows for
the identiﬁcation of moderator variables. Our computer-based literature search in specialized databases, manual searches in
relevant journals, and the examination of reference lists of studies and theoretical articles yielded 70 independent samples
(N = 24,733) that met our selection criteria.
Our ﬁndings showed a signiﬁcant and small overall relationship between human capital and success (rc = .098). Moderator
analyses indicated that the magnitude of the success relationship depends on conceptualizations of human capital, the context of
the ﬁrm, and the choice of success measures. The human capital–success relationship was higher for knowledge/skills which are
outcomes of human capital investments compared to experience/schooling which are direct human capital investments; the
relationships were also higher for human capital that was directly related to entrepreneurial tasks compared to human capital
with low task-relatedness, for young compared to old businesses, and for success measured as size compared to growth and
proﬁtability. The correlation between human capital and success can be as high as, for example, rc = .204 (for outcomes of human
capital investments) and rc = .140 (for young businesses).
These relationships are strong enough to draw theoretical and practical implications. Our results may guide practitioners in
their evaluation of small businesses and may resolve some of the controversies surrounding investment decisions and human
capital criteria. In order to maximize predictive validities, decision making should focus on task-speciﬁc human capital and
outcomes of human capital investments. Moreover, entrepreneurs should invest in the acquisition of task-related knowledge,
because knowledge is more important than past experiences. Finally, human capital criteria appear to be especially useful for
predicting success of businesses that are still young.
In addition to the practical implications, the variation of effect size magnitudes reported in our study also demonstrates the
theoretical usefulness to redirect human capital research in two ways. First, future research could shift the focus to investigating
the processes inherent in human capital theory. Given the dynamics in entrepreneurship and the constant need to learn and to
adapt, it may prove useful to look beyond the static concept of human capital and to examine outcomes of actual learning activities
and current learning. Second, in addition to focusing on the variance in the individual entrepreneurs, future research needs to
address circumstances that affect the size of the relationship between human capital and success. Thus, future researchers should
address contingencies in the relationship between human capital and entrepreneurial success. Such efforts may also help in
identifying stronger human capital relationships than the ones reported in this study.

2. Introduction
Human capital attributes – including education, experience, knowledge, and skills – have long been argued to be a critical resource
for success in entrepreneurial ﬁrms (e.g., Florin et al., 2003; Pfeffer, 1994; Sexton and Upton, 1985). Researchers' interest in human
capital is reﬂected in the numerous studies that have applied the concept to entrepreneurship (e.g., Chandler and Hanks, 1998;
Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Rauch et al., 2005a). In practice, investors have traditionally attached a high importance to the experiences
of entrepreneurs in their evaluation of ﬁrm potential (Stuart and Abetti, 1990). In fact, management skills and experience are the most
frequently used selection criteria of venture capitalists (Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000). Moreover, researchers have argued that human
capital may play an even larger role in the future because of the constantly increasing knowledge-intensive activities in most work
environments (e.g., Bosma et al., 2004; Honig, 2001; Pennings et al., 1998; Sonnentag and Frese, 2002).
To date, the interest in human capital continues, and most authors conclude that human capital is related to success (e.g.,
Bosma et al., 2004; Bruederl et al., 1992; Cassar, 2006; Cooper et al., 1994; Dyke et al., 1992; Van der Sluis et al., 2005). The
magnitude of this relationship, however, remains unknown. While some authors argue that the relationship between human
capital and entrepreneurial success is commonly overemphasized (Baum and Silverman, 2004), others argue that human capital
constitutes one of the core factors in the entrepreneurial process (Haber and Reichel, 2007). Thus, there is disagreement about the
relative importance of human capital in entrepreneurship research.
Moreover, the magnitude of the relationship between human capital and success seems to vary considerably across studies.
While some studies reported moderate or even high relationships (r > .40, Duchesneau and Gartner, 1990; r > .20, Frese et al.,
2007) other studies reported low relationships (e.g., r < .06, Davidsson and Honig, 2003; r < .10, Gimeno et al., 1997). One reason
for the variance of reported effects may be the presence of moderator variables. For example, an inspection of the literature shows
that studies differ in their conceptualizations of human capital, their choices of success indicators, and their study contexts such as
industry, country, and age of the business. Thus it remains unclear what kind of human capital should be related to success and
under what circumstances. Surprisingly, to our knowledge, no study has systematically investigated moderators inﬂuencing the
human capital–success relationship.
In this study, we address the human capital–success relationship by meta-analytically integrating the results of more than three
decades of human capital research. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative estimate of the population effects, allows for the correction
of statistical artifacts, and for the identiﬁcation of moderator variables (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990). Meta-analysis represents an
important step toward evidence-based entrepreneurship (Rauch and Frese, 2006) and is a practical tool for theory development.
The study contributes to the literature in at least three important ways. First, we determine the magnitude of the overall effect
of human capital on entrepreneurial success. Second, we test the effects of different human capital attributes, such as task-

relatedness and human capital investments versus outcomes of human capital investments. Finally, we identify conditions that
moderate the relationship between human capital and success.
3. Theory
3.1 . The concept of human capital
Human capital theory was originally developed to estimate employees' income distribution from their investments in human
capital (Becker, 1964; Mincer, 1958). The theory has been adopted by entrepreneurship researchers and has stimulated a
considerable body of directly related research (e.g., Chandler and Hanks, 1998; Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Rauch et al., 2005a)
and led to an even larger number of studies that include human capital into their prediction models of entrepreneurial success.
Researchers have employed a large spectrum of variables — all signifying human capital: formal education, training, employment
experience, start-up experience, owner experience, parent's background, skills, knowledge, and others.
Following Becker (1964), we deﬁne human capital as skills and knowledge that individuals acquire through investments in
schooling, on-the-job training, and other types of experience. Becker's (1964) deﬁnition suggests differentiating human capital
along with two distinct conceptualizations of human capital attributes: human capital investments versus outcomes of human
capital investments and task-related human capital versus human capital not related to a task. Human capital investments include
experiences such as education and work experience that may or may not lead to knowledge and skills. The outcomes of human
capital investments are acquired knowledge and skills. Task-relatedness addresses whether or not human capital investments and
outcomes are related to a speciﬁc task, such as running a business venture. The distinction of different human capital attributes is
important because it helps to (1) theoretically dismantle cause and effects of human capital attributes and to (2) theoretically
derive moderators of the human capital–success relationship.
A learning theoretical perspective speciﬁes the processes by which human capital attributes affect venture outcomes. Although
learning processes have been acknowledged from the onset of human capital theory (Becker, 1964; Mincer, 1958), human capital
researchers have paid little attention to the psychological processes and mechanisms that lead to human capital effects (cf. Davidsson
and Honig, 2003). Central for such a learning approach are acquisition and transfer of human capital (e.g., Reuber and Fischer, 1994;
Sohn et al., 2006).
Acquisition is the transformation from experience to knowledge and skills. Experience should not be equated with knowledge
because experience may or may not lead to increased knowledge (Sonnentag, 1998). Therefore, human capital investments may or
may not lead to outcomes of human capital investments (knowledge/skills). Thus, different processes of knowledge acquisition
require a distinction between human capital investments and outcomes of human capital investments.
Transfer is the application of knowledge acquired in one situation to another situation (e.g., Singley and Anderson, 1989).
Human capital theory does not explicate the process of transfer of human capital. The theory simply states that human capital
investments “improve knowledge, skills, or health, and thereby raise money or psychic incomes” (Becker, 1964, p. 1). From a
learning theoretical point of view, human capital has to be successfully transferred to the business owners' situation to increase
success. Successful transfer is easier in situations where new knowledge is similar to the task that needs to be performed, as
compared to new knowledge that is dissimilar to the task (Thorndike, 1906). Consequently, the task-relatedness of human capital
helps explain the differential effects of human capital on success.
3.2 . Human capital and success
Human capital theory assumes that people attempt to receive a compensation for their investments in human capital (Becker,
1964). Thus, individuals try to maximize their economic beneﬁts given their human capital. As a consequence, highly educated
people may not choose to become entrepreneurs because entrepreneurship may very well lead to reduced income compared to
other employment opportunities (Cassar, 2006; Evans and Leighton, 1989). However, once individuals have entered
entrepreneurship, those who have invested more in their human capital are likely to strive for more growth and proﬁts in
their business compared to individuals who have invested less in their human capital (Cassar, 2006), simply because they want to
receive higher compensation for their human capital investments. Otherwise, highly educated entrepreneurs would choose to
dissolve their ﬁrms and seek other, more lucrative employment opportunities (Gimeno et al., 1997). The arguments suggest that
according to human capital theory, human capital leads to entrepreneurial success.
The entrepreneurship literature provides a number of arguments on how human capital should increase entrepreneurial
success. First, human capital increases the capability of owners to perform the generic entrepreneurial tasks of discovering and
exploiting business opportunities (Shane and Venkatraman, 2000). For example, prior knowledge increases owners'
entrepreneurial alertness (cf. Westhead et al., 2005) preparing them to discover speciﬁc opportunities that are not visible to
other people (Shane, 2000; Venkatraman, 1997). Additionally, human capital affects owners' approaches to the exploitation of
opportunities (Chandler and Hanks, 1994; Shane, 2000). Second, human capital is positively related to planning and venture
strategy, which in turn, positively impacts success (Baum et al., 2001; Frese et al., 2007)1. Third, knowledge is helpful for acquiring
other utilitarian resources such as ﬁnancial and physical capital (Brush et al., 2001) and can partially compensate a lack of ﬁnancial
1
Note that there is a controversial debate about the planning-success relationship in the entrepreneurship literature (Brinckmann et al., 2010; Delmar and
Shane, 2004; Honig and Karlsson, 2004; Schwenk and Shrader, 1993).

<-----Page 3----->344

capital which is a constraint for many entrepreneurial ﬁrms (Chandler and Hanks, 1998). Finally, human capital is a prerequisite
for further learning and assists in the accumulation of new knowledge and skills (e.g., Ackerman and Humphreys, 1990; Hunter,
1986). Taken together, owners with higher human capital should be more effective and efﬁcient in running their business than
owners with lower human capital.
Hypothesis 1. There is a positive relationship between human capital and success.
3.3 . Human capital investment versus outcomes of human capital investments
According to Becker (1964), knowledge/skills are theoretically the result of human capital investments such as education and
work experience. Consequently, most studies have used education or work experience to measure the human capital construct as
proxies for entrepreneurs' human capital (Reuber and Fischer, 1994). This is a valid approach assuming that there is a relationship
between human capital investments and outcomes of human capital investments. Current research suggests that this is in fact the
case (Reuber and Fischer, 1994; Unger et al., 2009).
However, we argue that the success relationship is higher for outcomes of human capital investments than for human capital
investments because human capital investments are indirect indicators of human capital and are, therefore, one step removed,
while knowledge and skills (outcomes of human capital investments) are direct indicators of human capital (Davidsson, 2004).
Whether human capital investments lead to knowledge/skills depends on characteristics of the person and the environment (e.g.,
Gagné, 1985; Quiñones et al., 1995; Reuber and Fischer, 1994). There is no mechanistic one-to-one relationship of human capital
investments to outcomes of human capital investments. “It is possible that two individuals can be sent to start separate businesses
and thus have equal experiences. However, the outcomes can be dramatically different” (Quiñones et al., 1995, p. 905). Reﬂective
orientation (i.e., a focus on understanding the meaning of ideas and situations that help transfer concrete experience into new
information and knowledge; Kolb, 1984) and metacognitive activities (i.e., activities to control one's cognitions; Ford et al., 1998)
are two examples of many person variables that facilitate the transformation of experience into knowledge (e.g., Kolb, 1984; Keith
and Frese, 2005).
Moreover, the use of the same labels of experience does not mean that they are in fact the same. For example, education is often
measured as the years of schooling. Yet what has been learned (knowledge as the result of experience) depends on characteristics
of the school (business school or not, quality of the teaching, etc.). In conclusion, human capital conceptualized as an investment
may reveal little about the knowledge and skills that a person actually possesses. Human capital conceptualized as outcomes of
human capital investments on the other hand has the advantage that it is a direct assessment of human capital representing a
learning outcome. Outcomes of human capital investments, such as knowledge and skills, should inﬂuence effective actions by the
business owner directly. Outcomes of human capital investments should, therefore, yield higher and more consistent positive
relationships with success than human capital investments.
Hypothesis 2. The relationship between human capital and success is higher for outcomes of human capital investments than for
human capital investments.
3.4 . Task-relatedness of human capital
Human capital leads to higher performance only if it is applied and successfully transferred to the speciﬁc tasks that need to be
performed. The transfer process should be easier if human capital is related to the current tasks of the business owner. Generally,
transfer of schooling to real life works best if old and new activities share common situation-response elements (Thorndike, 1906).
It is, therefore, useful to distinguish between human capital that is task-related and human capital that is nontask-related (cf.
Becker, 1964; Cooper et al., 1994). Task-related human capital is human capital that relates to the current tasks of the business
owner (e.g., owner experience, start-up experience, industry experience, entrepreneurial knowledge). Nontask-related human
capital is human capital that does not relate to current tasks of the business owner (e.g., general education, employment
experience).
Tasks in entrepreneurship that concern all business owners include environmental scanning, selecting opportunities, and
formulating strategies for exploitation of opportunities, as well as organization, management, and leadership (Chandler and
Jansen, 1992; Mintzberg and Waters, 1982; Shane and Venkatraman, 2000). Human capital needs to be related to these tasks.
Task-relatedness of human capital is high if it is process speciﬁc (i.e., related to the processes and daily tasks of running a business)
and content speciﬁc (i.e., related to the industry the owner's business is in) (West and Noel, 2002). Owners with high task-related
human capital possess better knowledge of customers, suppliers, products, and services within the context of their business
(Gimeno et al., 1997). Such task-related human capital helps in the detection and exploitation of new business opportunities. Taskrelated human capital should, therefore, be more strongly related to success than nontask-related human capital.
Additionally, human capital that is related to the tasks in the current business context facilitates the acquisition of new
knowledge. The more similar prior knowledge is to newly acquired knowledge, the easier it is to absorb the new knowledge
(Cohen and Levinthal, 1990).
Overall, research in entrepreneurship appears to support our propositions (Bosma et al., 2004). Task-related industry
experience is positively related to business success (Lerner and Almor, 2002). In another study, owners were found to be more
successful if their current business was similar to past operations (Srinivasan et al., 1994). Not all studies, however, have yielded

<-----Page 4----->J.M. Unger et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 26 (2011) 341–358

345

clear-cut results (e.g., Chandler, 1996), thereby reinforcing the need for meta-analysis. Taken together, we suggest the following
hypothesis.
Hypothesis 3. The relationship between human capital and success is higher for human capital related to entrepreneurial tasks
than for human capital that is not related to entrepreneurial tasks.
3.5 . Context as a moderator of the human capital–success relationship
Contingency theory argues that the prediction of performance is higher if predictors are correctly aligned with certain key
variables, such as industry conditions and organizational processes (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967). Therefore, contingency theory
has been important in the development of management science (Venkatraman, 1989). With regard to the human capital–success
relationships, industry conditions are prime candidates for such a moderation effect. More speciﬁcally, the effects of human capital
on success may be especially important in high-technology industries. High-technology industries involve the use of sophisticated
and complex technologies, and they typically require extensive knowledge and research in dynamic and uncertain environments
(Khandwalla, 1976; Utterback, 1996). Human capital should help particularly in such knowledge-intensive industries because
knowledge and valid information reduce uncertainty associated with innovation and dynamic environments (Kirzner, 1997;
McMullen and Shepherd, 2006). High-technology industries are more dynamic than low-technology industries and, therefore,
owners in these industries have to continually adapt to new developments. Since human capital helps in the acquisition of new
knowledge and skills and enables business owners to make better and faster decisions (e.g., Reuber and Fisher, 1999), human
capital is more important in high-technology industries than in low-technology industries (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Tyson,
1992).
Hypothesis 4. The relationship between human capital and success is higher in high-technology industries than in lowtechnology industries.
Human capital can create competitive advantages if it is sufﬁciently different from competitors (Alvarez and Barney, 2001).
Taken to the extreme — if all owners possessed the same human capital, there would be no competitive advantage. In developing
countries, human capital is more heterogeneous and rather scarce than in highly developed countries. An example is the literacy
rate which is considerably higher in industrial Western nations than in developing countries (see, e.g., UNDP, 1998). Therefore,
human capital is more likely to create competitive advantage in the developing world. Moreover, developing countries trigger
more “necessity” entrepreneurship (Reynolds et al., 2002) because people are forced into self-employment or starting-up
businesses as there are no other alternatives available. Thus, there is higher variance of people's human capital in developing
countries.
Another way to look at the same issue is from a methodological point of view. Human capital heterogeneity in the developing
world implies higher variances of human capital compared to the developed world. Higher variance makes it easier to detect
relationships (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990). Researchers have previously suggested similar explanations for failure to ﬁnd
relationships between education and success. Lerner et al. (1997) explained the lack of relationship between education and
success in Israeli business owners by the high and relatively uniform level of education in the country with little variance.
Hypothesis 5. The relationship between human capital and success is higher in less developed than in developed countries.
Human capital has been argued to be especially important in young businesses (Davidsson and Honig, 2003). Young
enterprises suffer from the liability of newness, which refers to a higher propensity to fail for young enterprises as compared to
older, more established enterprises (Aldrich and Wiedenmayer, 1993; Stinchcombe, 1965). The liability of newness is partially due
to skill gaps and lack of information, and, therefore, human capital can reduce the liability of newness (Aldrich and Auster, 1986).
For example, owners of young businesses are typically confronted with many different and potentially new tasks. They have to
respond to new situations that may require immediate decisions and actions. Routines and strategies, however, have yet to be
developed (cf. Bantel, 1998). Thus, accomplishing daily tasks in the business, solving problems, and making entrepreneurial
decisions (e.g., decisions to act upon business opportunities) pose cognitive challenges to owners of young businesses. High
human capital assists such owners to learn new tasks and roles and to adapt to new situations (Weick, 1996). In contrast, owners
of older businesses have a “track record” and routines and established practices they can refer to. Over the years, variables other
than the owners' human capital may become more important. Since human capital created legitimacy for young enterprises,
owners' human capital should be more important in the initial years of business rather than during later stages.
Hypothesis 6. The relationship between human capital and success is higher for younger business than for older businesses.
3.6 . Human capital and different measures of success
The relative magnitude of effects of human capital may depend on the choice of the success criterion used. Research suggests
that success is a multidimensional construct (e.g., Combs et al., 2005). Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1986) distinguish between
ﬁnancial and operational performance of entrepreneurial organizations. Indicators of ﬁnancial performance reﬂect the ﬁrm's
economic achievements while indicators of operational performance (such as innovativeness) are factors that may lead to
ﬁnancial performance.

<-----Page 5----->346

J.M. Unger et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 26 (2011) 341-358

Human capital theory suggests that people want to be compensated for their human capital investments, assuming that people
seek to maximize their economic beneﬁts over their life time. Accordingly, human capital theory was originally developed to
explain variations in ﬁnancial returns of employees. Applied to entrepreneurship this means that entrepreneurs strive to receive
ﬁnancial returns from their venturing activities relative to their human capital investments. Therefore, entrepreneurs' human
capital should be positively associated with a preference for venture scale and growth (Cassar, 2006). Consequently, human capital
theory is particularly useful in explaining the ﬁnancial performance. Financial performance can be assessed by different indicators
that reﬂect distinct dimensions (Venkatraman and Ramanujam, 1986). In their meta-analysis, Combs et al. (2005) found evidence
on the convergent and discriminant validity of the three performance dimensions: proﬁtability, growth, and stock market
performance. In our meta-analysis we cannot include stock market performance because most ﬁrms studied in entrepreneurship
research are analyzed before going public. Instead, we included ﬁrm size as a performance indicator that represents the scale of
business operations (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Frese et al., 2007). The literature does not allow clear theoretical
predictions on the relative magnitude of the relationship between human capital and the different indicators of ﬁnancial
performance. Therefore, we do not suggest an a priori hypothesis; instead we pose a research question on the relationship of
human capital with the three success indicators.
3.6.1 . Research question
Is the relationship between human capital and success different dependent on which speciﬁc concept of success is used
(proﬁtability, growth, size)?
4. Method
4.1. Selection criteria
We focused on studies deﬁning entrepreneurship as business ownership and active management (Stewart and Roth, 2001). To
be included in the meta-analysis, studies were required to report a correlation between an indicator of human capital and a
measure of entrepreneurial success or a statistic that allowed the transformation into a correlation measure. The success measure
needed to address the entrepreneurial ﬁrm in order to ensure a consistent level of analysis. We considered indicators that measure
proﬁtability and growth as dimensions of ﬁnancial performance (Combs et al., 2005). In addition, we included ﬁrm size as a
performance indicator for entrepreneurial ﬁrms which start from zero (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990). We decided not to
include studies reporting ﬁrm dissolution as the dependent variable. Such measures are often ambiguous because they may or may
not signify business failure (Headd, 2003). To avoid bias in our results we excluded studies that only reported signiﬁcant effects.
4.2. Collection of studies
The goal of our study collection was to identify all empirical studies that match the scope of the study described above. This is
necessary to allow breaking down studies into different categories (Lipsey and Wilson, 2001). Therefore, we used a number of
different strategies to identify studies reporting relationships between human capital and entrepreneurial success Glass et al.,
1981; Rauch and Frese, 2006): ﬁrst, we initiated a computer-based literature search in specialized databases for all years available,
such as PsycINFO (1987–2008), ABI/Inform (1971–2008), EBSCO (Business Source Elite, 1985–2008), SSCI (Social Science Citation
Index, 1972–2008), EconLit (1969–2008), and ERIC (Expanded Academic Index, 1985–2008). We used variations of keywords of
entrepreneurship (e.g., entrepreneur, business owner, small business, venture, small ﬁrm), of human capital (e.g., human capital,
education, schooling, knowledge, skills, ability, competence) and of entrepreneurial success (e.g., success, performance, growth,
proﬁt, income, size, sales, ROI, ROE, ROA, ROS). Second, we manually searched relevant journals such as the Journal of Business
Venturing (1995–2008), Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice (1985–2008), Journal of Small Business Management (1985–
2008), Academy of Management Journal (1985–2008), Journal of Applied Psychology (1985–2008), Administrative Science
Quarterly (1985–2008), and the Entrepreneurship and Regional Development (1989–2008). The third strategy we applied was to
search the conference proceedings of the Academy of Management (1984–2008) and the Babson College Entrepreneurship
Research Conference (1981–2008). Finally, we examined the reference lists of located articles for additional studies not identiﬁed
before.
Our search resulted in 495 studies. We applied a hierarchical screening procedure in order to decide whether to include a study
or not: in a ﬁrst step, we rejected all studies that were not empirical papers (k = 51). We additionally rejected papers that included
case studies or other qualitative research (k = 24). In a second step, we inspected the method section of each remaining study to
check whether or not the study met the scope of our meta-analysis. We excluded 210 studies that did not meet our criteria for
inclusions: of these, 196 studies did not provide an indicator of human capital and/or an indicator of success; 14 studies did not
sample business owners and active managers. Additionally, 22 studies did not address the relationship between owners' human
capital and ﬁrm performance (e.g., a comparison of different types of entrepreneurs, or comparing income between entrepreneurs
and employees). Of the remaining 188 studies, 123 studies did not provide the statistical information required to calculate an
effect size (e.g., only multivariate regressions reported). We contacted the authors of these studies and asked them for the
bivariate data yielding 9 additional correlation matrices or data ﬁles (in fact, we received only 62 replies, and the majority of
authors indicated that the data was no longer available to them or that they were not able to create the correlation matrix due to
time constraints). Following this procedure, we identiﬁed 74 studies; double publications reduced this number to a total of 70

independent samples that were included in our meta-analysis. Table 1 displays the characteristics of the studies included in our
analysis.
4.3. Variable coding
The coding of human capital investments included all human capital conceptualizations that are based on past experiences. The
coding of outcomes of human capital investment integrated direct assessments of entrepreneurs' knowledge, skills, and
competencies. Table 2 displays our coding of measures applied in the studies included in the meta-analysis and the frequencies of
the human capital indicators that were used. The ﬁrst observation of our coding is that the majority of studies used measures of
human capital investments rather than outcomes of human capital investments. The most frequently employed indicators of
human capital investments were education (used 69 times), start-up experiences (31 times), industry speciﬁc experience (22
times), management experience (21 times), and work experience (12 times). Most assessments of outcomes of human capital
investments measured entrepreneurial skills, competencies, and knowledge. In the category of task-related human capital startup experience (31 times), industry speciﬁc experience (22 times), and management experience (21 times) were the most
frequently used operationalizations of human capital. Other predictors of task-related human capital included having a selfemployed parent or indicators of speciﬁc experiences in trade, technology, or small business ventures. Education (69 times) and
work experience (12) were most frequently used to assess nontask-related human capital.
We further coded the study context. The country of the businesses under investigation was coded as belonging to the
developed or less developed part of the world (countries receiving development assistance and aid in 2003; cf. Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, Manning, 2005). We further coded whether the business operated in a high-technology
sector (e.g., computer, biotechnology industry) or a low-technology sector (e.g., gastronomy, wood manufacturing). Moreover, we
classiﬁed businesses as young businesses if studies included businesses that existed for less than 8 years on average and as old
businesses if businesses existed for more than 8 years on average (cf. Bantel, 1998; McDougall and Robinson, 1990). Measures of
entrepreneurial success were classiﬁed in line with the entrepreneurial and organizational performance dimensions mentioned in
the literature (Combs et al., 2005; Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990): proﬁtability, growth, and size. The coding of performance

measures displayed in Table 3 indicates that the size was measured predominantly by number of employees (used 28 times) and
sales volume (15 times). Similar to what was reported by Delmar (1997), growth was most frequently assessed by sales growth
(16 times) and employment growth (15 times). Proﬁt was the most frequently used indicator of proﬁtability (14 times). Finally,
we coded each study according to whether it was published or not, which enabled us to statistically control for publication bias
(Hunter and Schmidt, 1990).
4.4. Analytical approaches
Our analysis was based on the meta-analytic procedures developed by Hunter and Schmidt (1990). Effect sizes were based on
Pearson product-moment correlations (r). When r was not reported but other statistics were available (e.g., t-test, chi-square,
etc.), we converted these values into the r statistic (using META5.3 by Schwarzer (1989)). Whenever studies reported multiple
correlations between human capital and performance we aggregated the effects within studies by using the mean value. To
prevent including double publications in our meta-analysis, we applied a search strategy to all identiﬁed publications and
compared them with regard to speciﬁc criteria (sample size, country of origin, and authors). By applying this strategy we were able
to identify three studies that published overlapping or identical samples seven times. In order to utilize all information possible
without violating sample independence (Petitti, 2000), we also computed the mean effect size across those studies that were
based on the same sample, thus including them only once into the analysis.

For estimating the overall relationship between human capital and success we computed the sample weighted average effect
across all studies. Moreover, we corrected dependent and independent variables for measurement unreliability. Since not all studies
included information concerning the reliability of measurements, we computed the average reliability of human capital and success
measures across the sample. Whenever a study did not indicate reliabilities for either human capital or success we used the average
reliability of this variable as the best estimate (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990). The average reliability for human capital was r = .768
(based on 22 studies) and r = .774 for success (based on 17 studies). While we note that our reliability estimate is based on a small
number of reported reliabilities, the reliability corrected effect size most likely reﬂects the true correlation more precisely than the
sample weighted effect size. Therefore, Lipsey and Wilson (2001) suggested collecting whatever reliability information is reported,
even if a large proportion of coefﬁcients is not available for individual effect sizes (p. 110). In Table 4 we report both the reliability
corrected and the sample size weighted correlations. The statistical tests of signiﬁcance, heterogeneity, and moderator effects are
based not on the reliability corrected values but only on the sample size weighted effect sizes (however, note that the statistical tests
are mostly invariant to reliability correction; see Hunter and Schmidt, 1990).
To determine whether an effect size was different from zero, we computed a 95% conﬁdence interval around the estimated
population correlation. If the lower boundaries of the 95% conﬁdence intervals are greater than zero, effects are signiﬁcant (Judge

et al., 2002). To estimate the severity of publication bias, we conducted ﬁle drawer analyses according to Rosenthal (1979). The
ﬁndings of these analyses indicate the number of studies with an effect size of zero needed to reduce the mean effect size to the
point of nonsigniﬁcance. Therefore, this estimate provides information on whether the observed effect size is spurious or not
(Lipsey and Wilson, 2001).
Several steps were taken to test moderator hypotheses. We ﬁrst examined homogeneity of all study effects. Homogeneity was
assessed by applying Hunter and Schmidt's (1990) 75% rule and calculating 95% credibility intervals. Effects are considered
homogenous if more than 75% of the observed effects' variance is explained by sampling error variance and if the 95% credibility
interval does not include zero (Judge et al., 2002). We took care not to underestimate effect heterogeneity. To assess heterogeneity
we, therefore, did not take the average effect size of each study but rather randomly selected one effect from each study. This
ensured that effect heterogeneity within studies was also considered. We report both conﬁdence and credibility intervals. While
conﬁdence intervals estimate variability in the mean correlation, credibility intervals estimate variability in the individual study
correlations. In other words, conﬁdence intervals tell us whether an estimated effect is different from zero.
When effects were heterogeneous we tested for moderators. The existence of a moderator was indicated if effect subgroups
were homogenous and if homogeneity averaged across the moderator subgroups was higher than homogeneity of the overall
effects. To examine the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference between each moderator pair we calculated z-statistics. The sum of
studies for some moderator tests differs from 70 because some studies reported effects on both sides of the moderators. Thus, the
assumption of independent effect sizes is diminished in the moderator analysis (Crook et al., 2008; De Dreu and Weingart, 2003).
5. Results
Our results supported Hypothesis 1 which proposed a positive overall relationship between human capital and success
(Table 4). The sample size weighted and reliability corrected overall effect across studies was rc = .098. Moreover, the boundaries
of the 95% conﬁdence were r = .059 and r = .093 (Table 4), indicating that the overall effect was signiﬁcant. File drawer analysis
according to Rosenthal (1979) indicated a required number of K = 5778 studies with zero effects to make the effect insigniﬁcant.
Heterogeneity of the effects for the overall relationship between human capital and success pointed to the existence of moderating
variables. Sampling error estimated from a series of randomly selected effects explained 23.67% of the overall variability across the
70 studies and 524 effects. The credibility interval included zero (Table 4).
Next, we tested moderator hypotheses. The success relationship was higher for outcomes of human capital investments
(rc = .204) than for human capital investments (rc = .090) supporting Hypothesis 2. The variance due to sampling error increased
substantially, although variance explained by sampling error did not exceed the 75% criterion. Both credibility intervals included
zero, thus suggesting further moderating inﬂuences.
Task-relatedness moderated the relationship between human capital and success. In support of Hypothesis 3, human capital
indicators that were related to entrepreneurial tasks showed higher relationships than indicators of human capital with low taskrelatedness (rc = .109 and rc = .069, respectively). Neither conﬁdence interval included zero. As indicated by the increased
percentage of variance due to sampling error, homogeneity was higher compared to the overall study effects. The 75% criterion
was not reached; therefore, further moderators exist.
According to Hypothesis 4, the technological environment of the business inﬂuences the effect size. In contrast to this
hypothesis, human capital relationships with success were equally strong in both high (rc = .109) and low-technology industries
(rc = .130). Effects in the group of high-technology businesses were homogeneous; effects in the low-technology group remained
heterogeneous, suggesting that it would be useful to search for moderators.
Hypothesis 5 postulated a higher human capital–success relationship for businesses operating in less developed countries than
for businesses in developed countries. The moderator effect was only marginally signiﬁcant (z = 1.71, p < .10) with a human
capital–success relationship of rc = .122 in less developed compared to rc = .084 in developed countries. Although sampling error
accounted for an increased percentage of variance, Hypothesis 5 was rejected.
We hypothesized age of business to moderate the human capital–success relationship (Hypothesis 6). In support of Hypothesis 6,
human capital effects were higher in young businesses (rc = .140) than in old business (rc = .056). The moderator effect was signiﬁcant
(z = 2.40, p < .05). The 75% criterion suggested homogeneity in the group of old business and heterogeneity in the group of young
businesses. The credibility intervals included zero indicating that further moderators may exist.
The relationship between human capital and success varied with the choice of success measurements used in the studies
(Research question). The relationship for size (rc = .119) was signiﬁcantly higher than for growth (rc = .069) and proﬁtability
(rc = .057). There was no difference in effects between growth and proﬁt oriented measures of success. While the variation in the
effects was homogenous for size, it remained heterogeneous for growth and proﬁt.
Finally, we found that publication bias did not affect our results; both published and unpublished studies reported effect sizes
of similar size (z = .61, ns).
6 . Discussion
We integrated over 30 years of human capital research in entrepreneurship in our meta-analysis; the analysis is based on 70
studies with an overall sample size of 24,733. The magnitude of the population effect between human capital and entrepreneurial
success was estimated to be rc = .098. Thus, we can conclude that there is an overall positive relationship between human capital
and entrepreneurial success. However, this effect is low given the high amount of attention the concept of human capital has

<-----Page 12----->J.M. Unger et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 26 (2011) 341–358

353

received in the entrepreneurship literature. The success relationship of human capital is smaller than those of personality (Rauch
and Frese, 2007) or entrepreneurial orientation (Rauch et al., 2009).
The overall effect, however, should be interpreted carefully. A number of variables moderated the success relationship. While the
effects remained positive and distinct from zero under all moderating conditions, the size of effects varied signiﬁcantly (cf. next
paragraph), thus demonstrating the usefulness of a moderator approach to investigating human capital.
Moderators in our studies can be divided into three groups: conceptualizations of human capital, the context of the ﬁrm, and
the choice of success measurements. The ﬁrst group included moderators that were derived from learning theory (human capital
investments versus outcomes of human capital investments and task-relatedness). The effects were higher for human capital
conceptualized as outcomes of human capital investments (rc = .204) than for human capital conceptualized as human capital
investments (rc = .090). Moreover, the correlations were higher for human capital related to entrepreneurial tasks (rc = .109) than
for human capital variables with low task-relatedness (rc = .069) and, thus, they support the importance of speciﬁc human capital
as compared to general human capital. The second group of moderator variables included moderators that were context related.
Effects were higher for young than for old businesses (rc = .140 and rc = .056, respectively). High versus low-technology did not
make a difference for the relationship between human capital and success. The moderator developed versus less developed
countries as the study context proved to be only marginally signiﬁcant. This implies that there may be a moderator in this area
which we were unable to uncover in this meta-analysis. Finally, moderators related to the choice of success measurement
produced different effect sizes. Size oriented success measures yielded higher relationships with human capital than proﬁt and
growth oriented measures of success (rc = .110, rc = .057, and rc = .069, respectively).
6.1. Implications for future research
The small overall effect size of human capital as well as the heterogeneity of reported effect sizes clearly requires additional
explanation. First, human capital has to be task-related and directly related to knowledge and skills. The increase in effect sizes
when human capital is measured at a higher level of speciﬁcity (e.g., number of times performing a task) was found in a previous
meta-analysis of employees' work experience (Quiñones et al., 1995). Our ﬁndings suggest shifting research on human capital
away from a static view of entrepreneurship to a process view. Past experience as an indicator of human capital may not be the
most useful variable because experience per se does not lead to knowledge — in this context other third variables are likely to have
an impact, such as individual differences or the richness of the learning environment (Reuber and Fischer, 1994). Current
knowledge is more directly related to effective behavior by the entrepreneur and, therefore, produces higher effect sizes than
measures of pure past experiences (Davidsson, 2004). Our results suggest that future research should address learning processes
and should focus on learning from experience. Such a learning perspective can explicate the processes that lead to acquisition of
knowledge and skills from experience. Learning goals and learning behavior may play an important role in this context. A process
point of view on learning will also acknowledge that, in the face of rapidly changing environments, any speciﬁc knowledge is likely
to have a decreasing shelf life (Reuber and Fisher, 1999). Some skills and knowledge will even have to be unlearned, that is,
replaced by other and better knowledge and skills. Thus, a ﬁrm's willingness, effort, and capability to learn fast and continuously
are likely to be a key to sustained competitive advantage. Besides learning behavior, other human capital aspects may become
more relevant such as the construct of adaptive expertise (Smith et al., 1997) or the stream of experience (e.g., events that happen,
which Reuber and Fisher (1999) contrast to the stock of experience).
Our results suggest strengthening the moderator approach to human capital. This is in line with Shane and Venkatraman
(2000) who argued that successful opportunity recognition and exploitation depends on individual and situational characteristics.
Future studies on human capital of entrepreneurs should not focus on the individual entrepreneur alone and thereby ignore
situational characteristics that may affect the relationship between human capital and success. The moderator approach has
important implications for a contingency theory of human capital. Potential contingencies may be the degree of other resources,
such as ﬁnancial resources (or presence of venture capital). The relationship between human capital and success may also depend
on characteristics of the individual entrepreneurs themselves. For example, human capital can only result in high growth if the
entrepreneur has the aspirations to expand the business (Wiklund and Shepherd, 2003). Moreover, people have different
performance thresholds (Gimeno et al., 1997) that are in turn dependent on motivation (DeTienne et al., 2008). In general, the
heterogeneity of effect sizes reported in our study suggests the necessity to specify the boundaries of the human capital–success
relationship.
Our analysis yielded no difference of human capital effects between high and low-technology industries. Apparently, human
capital is important in low as well as in high-technology industries. This result is in line with a study that did not ﬁnd stronger
human capital–success relationships in knowledge-intensive industries as compared to other industries (Bosma et al., 2004).
While we do not suggest, that low and high-technology industries require the same kind and level of human capital, both
industries may need a similar level of adaptability resulting in similar magnitudes of human capital–success relationships.
However, human capital may very well lead to competitive advantages within certain industries in contrast to others because
factors other than technology may play a role. It would further be interesting to investigate three-way-interactions. For example, a
high degree of required specialization in high-technology industries may lead to higher effects of task-related human capital in
high compared to low-technology industries.
The meta-analytic results revealed that effect sizes varied depending on the type of success measure — size was more highly
related to human capital than growth or proﬁtability. As far as we know, this has not been suggested by the literature. Thus, all of
our remarks here are, by necessity, speculative. If human capital advantages accumulate over time, they should affect ﬁrm

<-----Page 13----->354

performance in each consecutive year. Size may signify accumulated success or growth since start-up — at least for business
owners who are also founders of their ﬁrm (Frese et al., 2007). Thus, it can be argued that size is an appropriate measure of success
in newly founded businesses that start from zero (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990). However, there are limitations involved in
the prediction of size, for instance, size depends on the age of the enterprise as well as on the life cycle of the industry, issues that
need to be addressed when predicting ﬁrm size. Proﬁtability had the smallest relationship with human capital in our analysis. Most
studies included in our analysis used a cross-sectional design. Moreover, most studies also operationalized proﬁtability by
measuring the ﬁrm's absolute proﬁt levels instead of using relative proﬁtability indicators such as ROS or ROA (cf. Table 3). Human
capital may not affect immediate proﬁts. Human capital affects opportunity exploitation, planning, and venture strategy (Baum
et al., 2001; Frese et al., 2007), and such processes affect performance over time. Thus, if the effects of human capital evolve over
time, using current proﬁts as the success measure may represent a time-lag that is too short in the evaluation of how human
capital affects success. Our research suggests that human capital theory might want to develop a more speciﬁc theory of how
human capital relates to the different criteria of success.
Future operationalization of human capital should take the speciﬁc task requirements of the entrepreneurs into consideration.
Studies included in our meta-analysis used measures of general education and general work experience in 81 cases. Such an
assessment of general human capital is probably useful for predicting success of entrepreneurs throughout their life time.
However, entrepreneurial success is often context speciﬁc and, therefore, needs to be predicted with task-speciﬁc human capital.
Moreover, we found only 37 studies that measured outcomes of human capital investments. Direct assessments of knowledge and
skills should be done more often, particularly if the goal is to evaluate a speciﬁc enterprise or whether or not an entrepreneur has
the potential to run a high growth company. Such a knowledge and skills test requires a high degree of analysis of the speciﬁc tasks
at hand in a particular environment.
6.2. Limitations
While meta-analysis is an answer to many problems inherent in narrative reviews of the literature it is not a remedy for all
problems. Potential limitations include scope, inﬂuence of confounding variables, and publication bias. We took several measures
to counteract potential problems. First, we limited our analysis to the population of active owners or copartners with main
responsibility in the business and to human capital attributes included in the literature that can be experientially acquired. Second,
we did a number of tests on potential confounds and discovered that these confounds did not produce artiﬁcial differences — these
were not directly reported in our results; for example, there were no differences between dichotomous and continuous variables
of success and between small and medium-sized ﬁrms. Third, ﬁle drawer analysis indicated that publication bias was not a
problem. Moreover, we included many studies that merely used human capital as control variables: this is useful because these
studies had no agenda with respect to proving a certain hypothesis.
Other potential limitations are linked to the limitations of primary studies. For example, none of the primary studies included
an analysis of the survivor bias. This is, in principle, an important methodological issue because ﬁrm survival itself may be
determined by human capital. The literature is controversial: some authors argue that owners with low human capital are more
likely to fail (e.g., Bruederl et al., 1992). Other authors found that owners with high human capital and high performance
thresholds are more likely to discontinue (Gimeno et al., 1997). This may result in lower reported effect sizes of human capital–
success relationships. If both mechanisms are happening, the variance of the surviving ﬁrms is truncated. Reduced variance leads
to reduced correlations of the variables (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990). Findings are therefore limited to surviving ﬁrms.
Our meta-analysis did not include survival and failure as success measures because there were not enough studies that
operationalized survival and failure appropriately. While some studies suggest that there is a signiﬁcant positive relationship
between human capital variables and survival (e.g., Bruederl et al., 1992; Evans and Leighton, 1989; Gimeno et al., 1997), others
have reported insigniﬁcant relationships (Bates, 1990; Cooper et al., 1994; Kalleberg and Leicht, 1991; Stuart and Abetti, 1990).
However, many of these studies did not distinguish between success and survival and between failure and successful closure
(Headd, 2003). Our results, thus, cannot be generalized to survival and failure of business ventures. A related problem inherently
present in most of the included studies is the confusion of the level of analysis in human capital research (Davidsson and Wiklund,
2001). If human capital is an individual level construct, the entrepreneur would try to maximize individual level returns.
Individual level returns are not necessarily achieved by ﬁrm-level performance (Gimeno et al., 1997). For example, some
entrepreneurs may maximize their return by having multiple enterprises or even employment on the side. On the other hand, if
the dependent variable reﬂects ﬁrm-level performance, human capital may be better assessed at the level of the ﬁrm and should,
thus, examine the human capital level of the employees (Davidsson and Wiklund, 2001).
7. Conclusion
This meta-analysis provides a useful estimate of the true relationship between human capital and entrepreneurial success. The
overall effect size was .098. While this effect size is small by statistical standards (Cohen, 1977), it is as high as, for instance, the
correlation between planning and success (r = .10; Brinckmann et al., 2010). While traditional statistical reasoning may argue
against the practical importance of such correlations, these correlations may well have important implications, as the ﬁeld of
medical meta-analyses has shown (Meyer et al., 2001). As a matter of fact, a correlation of .10 may well translate into a difference
of a two times higher success rate in business owners with a high degree of human capital in comparison to those with a low
degree of human capital (Rosenthal and Rubin, 1982).

Our study may guide practitioners in their evaluation of small businesses and may resolve some of the controversies
surrounding investment decisions and human capital criteria. Investors are well advised to carefully choose from the pool of
available human capital indicators. Just using any human capital indicator may be a poor advice given the overall effect size
reported in our analysis. Our analysis suggests to rely on knowledge and task-related human capital and, thereby, considering the
speciﬁc contextual requirements of the entrepreneur.
Future studies could build on our distinctions of human capital to directly assess incremental validities of different types of
human capital. In addition to other success predictors selected human capital indicators may also increase the accuracy of
prediction models and help practitioners in their decision process.
