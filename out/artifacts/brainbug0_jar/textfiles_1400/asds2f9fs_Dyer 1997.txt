This study of automotive transaction relationships in the U.S.A. and Japan offers abta which
indicate that transaction costs do not necessarily increase with an increase in reiation-specijk
investments. We empirically examine the conditions under which transactors can simultaneously
achieve the twin benejits of high asset specificity and low transaction costs. This is possible
because the dtfferent safeguards which can be employed to control opportunism have different
set-up costs and result in different transaction costs over dl~erent time horizons. We examine
in detail the ~ractices of Javanese firms which result in effective

we have generally accepted that transaction costs
increase with increases in asset specificity. However, few studies have attempted to explicitly
measure how market transaction costs change
with_a change in asset specificity. As Williamson
( 1985: 105) observed: ‘A common characteristic
of these studies is that direct measures of transaction costs are rarely attempted.’
In a recent study, Dyer ( 1996b) found that
Japanese transactors ( suppliers–automakers) made
greater asset-specific investments than their U.S.
counterparts and that these investments were correlated with superior performance. These results
are not particularly surprising since various studies have suggested that Japanese suppliers and
final assemblers have close relationships and are
often part of a ‘keiretsu’ group (Asanuma, 1985;
Nishiguchi, 1994). But what was particularly
intriguing was that Japanese transactors incurred
significantly lower transactions costs2 than U.S.
transactors, even though they had made greater
asset-specific investments. Moreover, even within
Japan (i.e., controlling for the institutional
environment), the Japanese automaker with the
more specialized supplier group (Toyota) had
lower transaction costs than the Japanese automaker with the less specialized supplier group
(Nissan). These findings appear to be inconsistent
with transaction cost theory which proposes that
transaction costs increase with art increase in
investments
(Williamson,
transaction-specific
1985). Moreover, these findings are important
because they suggest that firms (production
networks) can simultaneously achieve the twin
benejts of high asset specificity and low transaction costs—a condition that could be an
important source of competitive
advantage.
Understanding how such a condition is achieved
may provide important insights into effective
interfirm collaboration.
This paper has two primary objectives. The
first objective is to provide evidence that transaction costs do not necessady increase with an
increase in asset specificity. This is accomplished
by reporting supplier group specialization and
transaction costs for Toyota, Nissan, Chrysler,

GM, and Ford. Interestingly, the automaker with
the least specialized supplier group (GM) had the
highest transaction costs while the automaker with
the most specialized supplier group (Toyota) had
the lowest transaction costs. The second, and
primary, objective is to explore why those results
might have been obtained. To explain these findings, the paper offers five propositions which
are developed from an exploratory study of 50
supplier–automaker
transaction relationships in
the U.S.A. and Japan and a mail survey of 156
suppliers. The exploratory study centered around
the question: What increases (or decreases) the
costs of transacting with suppliers (automakers)?
The objective was to examine what actions taken
by suppliers and automakers serve to increase or
decrease transaction costs.

THEORETICAL

BACKGROUND

Extant transaction cost economics (TCE) theory
suggests that as transactors increase their investments in specialized assets, transaction costs
increase because transactors must safeguard
against the hazards of opportunism (Klein, Crawford, and Alchian, 1978; Williamson, 1985). As
Williamson (199 la 282) has argued, ‘asset specificity increases the transaction costs of all forms
of governance.’ Transaction costs can be decomposed into four separate costs related to transacting: ( 1) search costs, (2) contracting costs,
(3) monitoring costs, and (4) enforcement costs
(Williamson, 1985; Hennart, 1993; North, 1990).
Search costs include the costs of gathering information to identify and evaluate potential trading
partners. Contracting costs refer to the costs associated with negotiating and writing an agreement.
Monitoring costs refer to the costs associated
with monitoring the agreement to ensure that each
party fulfills the predetermined set of obligations.
Enforcement costs refer to the costs associated
with ex post bargaining and sanctioning a trading
partner that does not perform according to the
agreement.
Transaction costs increase when asset specificity increases due to opportunism (defined by
Williamson, 1985, as ‘self-interest seeking with
guile’ ). Although investments in specialization
boost productivity, the incentive to make transaction-specific investments is tempered by the
fact that the more specialized a resource becomes,

<-----Page 2----->E#ective
the lower its value in alternative uses. The contingent value of a specialized resource exposes its
owner to a greater risk of opportunism than the
owner of a generalized resource (Klein, Crawford,
and Alchian, 1978).
Types of safeguards or governance structures
To protect against the hazards of opportunism,
transactors may employ a variety of safeguards
or governance structures. The term ‘safeguard’
(or alternatively ‘governance structure’ ) as used
here cart be defined as a control mechanism which
has the objective of bringing about the perception
of fairness or equity among transactors. The purpose of safeguards is to provide, at minimum
cost, the control and ‘trust’ that is necessary for
transactors to believe that engaging in the
off
will
exchange
make
them
better
(Williamson, 1985).
The most prominent safeguard employed in
Western economies is the legal contract. A legal
contract specifies the obligations of each party
and allows a transactor to go to a third party
(i.e., courts/state) to sanction an opportunistic
trading partner. For simple transactions, when
asset specificity is low, a classical contract is
typically employed. The costs of writing a classical contract are relatively low since the entire
obligations of each party are explicitly written
‘within the four comers of the document’
(Macneil, 1978). As asset specificity increases,
transactors will attempt to write a more complex
contract (i.e., a neoclassical contract) with contingency clauses which allow for equitable adjustment as market conditions chartge.3 In theory,
and practice, writing such a contract is more
costly than writing a classical contract (Macneil,
1978; Williamson, 1985). Thus, received theory
predicts that as asset specificity increases, so does
the full array of transaction costs (i.e., contracting, monitoring, and enforcement costs). As
asset specificity increases above some threshold,
the costs of contacting become prohibitive and
transactors move to unified governance/hierarchy
(Williamson, 1985).

Although contracts are viewed as the primary
means for safeguarding transactions in Western
economies, alternative means have been offered
by scholars from various fields. These are typitally referred to as ‘self-enforcing’ agreements,
‘private ordering’, or ‘trust’ (Telser, 1980; Williamson, 1985; Sake, 1991). These self-enforcing
agreements include informal safeguards such as:
relational or goodwill trust (Dore, 1983; Bradach
and Eccles, 1989; Sake, 1991) and reputation
(Kreps and Wilson, 1982; Weigelt and Carnerer,
1988), as well as formal safeguards such as
jinancial hostages (Klein, 1980) and specialized
investment hostages (Klein, 1980; Williamson,
1983 ),4 Thus, transactors have a variety of ways
to protect against the hazards of opportunism.
The choice of safeguard influences
transaction costs and value
There are costs associated with constructing a
governance structure which we will refer to as
governance ‘set-up’ costs. These are the costs
incurred to create the safeguard which governs
the ongoing relationship and typically include the
costs associated with writing contracts, building
personal trust, creating financial hostages, etc.
One may consider governance set-up costs as a
subset of the total transaction costs incurred in a
trading relationship over time. For example, the
costs of writing a contract may be viewed as a
governance set-up cost, but also as a transaction
cost (i.e., the contracting/bargaining portion of
transaction costs). The important distinction that
we want to make here is that governance set-up
costs involve an initial, up-front investment which
creates the safeguard, which in turn influences
the ongoing transaction costs (i.e., bargaining,
monitoring costs ) in the exchange relationship.
To date, scholars have paid little attention to
the relative costs of different safeguards. However, different safeguards are likely to have di#erent set-up costs and result in different transaction
costs over different time horizons. A longitudinal
perspective towards transaction costs is required.
Moreover, previous research has shown that the

reduce the probability of opportunism but in fact raise the
potential for opportunistic behavior. Only symmetric investments in specialized assets will reduce the probability of
opportunism.

<-----Page 3----->538

choice and cost of a particular safeguard will vary
depending upon the identity of the transactors and
the transaction characteristics.s Further, beyond
cost minimization, Zajac and Olsen (1993) argue
that transactors should be concerned with maximizing transaction value through value creation
initiatives. The transactor’s choice of governance
structure influences the incentives of the transactors to engage in value creation behavior for
‘noncontractibles’ such as innovation, quality, and
responsiveness. For example, in the auto industry
the governance structure (i.e., degree of suppIier–
automaker t.mst) will influence whether or not the
supplier willingly engages in value engineering or
value anaIysis —initiatives designed to continuously lower the cost (and price) of the component
but which occur after the vehicle model is introduced. Such initiatives require resources and
effort on the part of the supplier that are not
specifically called for in the contractual agreement. Further, the governance structure influences
whether or not suppliers bring new ideas or new
technology to a particular automaker. Suppliers
are less willing to bring a new technology or
design to an automaker
employing
arm’s
length/market governance if they believe the
automaker will share it with their supplier competitors (in order to maintain competitive
bidding).
To illustrate how the choice of safeguard
influences transaction costs and incentives for
value creation behavior, consider a hypothetical
case in which I am a supplier of automotive
components and a particular customer requests
that I produce a customized part that requires
investments in specialized tools. Let us consider
four different transaction situations which result
in four different governance strategies. In the first
case, assume that the owner of the other firm is
my brother. In this case, I agree to make the
investment due to previously developed goodwill
trust/social knowledge. I may trust him either
because I know his ‘type’ (e.g., he is ‘honest’)

s Recent empirical studies by game theorists using the prisoner’s dilemma game (PDG) have demonstrated that opportunism varies depending upon the identity of the exchange
partner (see Axehmd, 1984, for a description of the PDG).
For example, one study found that husbands and wives made
100% cooperative (C) choices, compared with 65% for
friends, and 22% for strangers (Argyle, 1991). Clearly, the
identity of the exchange partner has sm influence on whether
one chooses to be opportunistic or cooperative.

and/or because I can impose social sanctions on
him through our kinship network.e This safeguard
is available to me because of considerable prior
investments in the relationship. Moreover, the
incremental transaction costs associated with
using this safeguard are minimal because the
governance set-up costs have already been
incurred. Thus, I choose to make the investment
and we transact while incurnng very low transaction costs. The safeguard employed in this case
(goodwill trust) may be effective for an indefinite
duration. Further, I am willing to make efforts
at value creation beyond the original agreement
because I am confident that the resulting gains
will be fairly shared.
When contemplating the same transaction with
a graduate school classmate, I may not have
enough ‘goodwill trust’ (enough social knowledge
to assess his ‘type’ or to know if he will respond
to social sanctions) to protect my investment.
Thus, I may choose to incur additional governanceset-up costs in the form of a legal contract.
In this situation I rely on both social as well as
legal sanctions to control opportunism. Of course,
the contract is of finite duration and will need to
be rewritten when it expires, thereby resulting in
additional transaction costs.
When contemplating the same transaction with
a complete stranger, I may be unwilling to rely
on a contract to protect my investment. Consequently, I may require that the buying firm purchase the specialized assets and allow me to use
them. This solution is also likely to involve a
contract which specifies ownership of the assets
as weIl as how [ am to use the assets. Moreover,
the buyer must incur additional monitoring costs
to ensure that I am not abusing the assets. Thus,
governance set-up costs and ongoing transaction
costs again increase relative to the previous cases.
Further, I am relatively unwilling to make efforts
at value creation ‘beyond the contract’ due to
uncertainty regarding whether or not I will be
fairly rewarded. Of course, a final solution would
be for one of the transactors to vertically integrate, thereby bringing the specialized assets

6 Of course, I may refuse to make the investment because I
know my brother’s ‘type’ (i.e., he is not honest) and/or I
know that he would not respond to social sanctions. The key
is that my long history of dkct interactions with him (i.e.,
my social knowledge) assists me in choosing an
appropriatelefficient safeguatd (Sohn, 1994).

<-----Page 4----->Effective
under common ownership to mitigate the bargaining problem.
In each of these hypothetical cases the degree
of asset specificity did not change, but the choice
and cost of the safeguard, as well as the ensuing
transaction costs, did change. Thus, we observe
that even in situations where the level of asset
specificity between transactors is identical, the
transaction costs may differ. The point is that
while transaction costs may increase with asset
specificity, they will also vary independently of
asset specijci~. Further, the transactors’ choice
of governance will influence not only transaction
costs but also the incentives to engage in value
creation initiatives. Williamson ( 1985: xiii) has
argued that the central problem of economic
organization is to ‘devise contract and governance
structures that have the purpose and effect of
economizing on bounded rationality while simultaneously safeguarding transactions against the
hazards of opportunism.’ Due to differences in
history, preferences, institutional environment,
etc., transactors will employ different strategies
with regard to both the level of asset specificity
as well as the choice of safeguard.

their supply base.
A survey was then mailed to the supplier
executive identified by the automaker purchasing
department as most responsible for managing the
day-to-day relationship. Usable responses were
received from 36 Nissan suppliers (72% response
rate), 38 Toyota suppliers (76Y0 response rate),
31 Ford suppliers (62% response rate), 24 General Motors suppliers (48% response rate) and 23
Chrysler suppliers (46% response rate). In
addition, the purchasing agent at the automaker
most responsible for the supplier relationship was
asked to complete a survey to provide the automaker perspective. Usable surveys were received
from purchasing agents for 192 of the 250 suppliers.’ On objective questions (e.g., distance
between the supplier and automaker plant ), suppliers and purchasing agents were asked the same
question. In these instances, purchasing agent
responses were used only if the supplier did not
respond. Consequently, for some questions the
response rate was as high as 48 out of 50 for a
particular automaker.

THE PUZZLE:
HIGH ASSET
SPECIFICITY AND LOW
TRANSACTION COSTS
To examine the relationship between asset specificity and transaction costs, we studied transaction
relationships in the auto industry. The objectives
were ( 1) to assess the extent to which an automaker’s supplier group was specialized to that
particular automaker, and (2) to measure each
automaker’s transaction costs associated with procuring parts from those suppliers. Following is a
brief description of the research methods and
results of this study (see Dyer, 1996a, 1996b, for
a more complete description of the research
methods and measures ).
Sample and data collection
The sample consisted of two Japanese automakers
(Nissan and Toyota), all three U.S. automakers,
and a sample of their suppliers. The unit of
analysis was the supplier–automaker relationship.
Each automaker purchasing department general
manager selected a sample of 50 domestic sup-

Williamson (1985 ) identified site, physical, and
human asset specificity as distinct types of transaction-specific investments. Operation measures
of each were included in this study. In addition,
we attempted to measure the ‘transaction costs’
incurred by the automaker in managing transactions with outside suppliers (see Table 1 for a
description of the asset specificity and transaction
cost operational measures). Automaker transaction
costs were measured as the total number of individuals employed in procurement for production
parts
(including
management,
purchasing
agents/buyers, lawyers, and support staff ) divided
by the total value of goods they procured in
1991. This is expressed as the dollw value of

employee. We believe this is a reasonably accurate measure of the relative transaction costs
incurred by automakers because the procurement
staff (including lawyers) (a) is completely
responsible for searching for new suppliers, (b)

to create an overall evaluation (monitoring) of

responsible for enforcing performance (i.e., the
lawyers will take the legal actions necessaty to
ensure contract fulfillment ). Thus. we believe our
measure is a reasonable proxy for the relative
transaction costs incurred by automakers.
Data analysis
The unit of analysis was the supplier–automaker
relationship. One-tailed t-tests were used to test
for differences in supplier-automaker asset specificity. For example, the site specificity (plant
distance) supplier group mean for Toyota’s suppliers was compared to the site specificity supplier
group mean for each of the other automakers.
Results
The results presented in Table 2 indicate that not
only were the Japanese transaction relationships
characterized by higher asset specificity than their
U.S. counterparts, but they also had lower transaction costs. Toyota and Nissan’s suppliers were
more specialized on all three measures of asset
specialization. Their plants were significantly
closer (greater site specificity), they had a higher
percentage of capital investments which were not
redeployable to other customers (greater absolute

physical asset specificity), and they had more
face-to-face contact and more guest engineers
(greater human specificity). Interestingly, Toyota’s suppliers were significantly more specialized
than were Nissan’s on both the site and human
specificityy measures. Furthermore, we found that
U.S. automakers, and in particular General
Motors, had higher transaction costs than did
Japanese automakers. The purchased volume of
goods per person was only $1.6 million for GM,
while it was $5.3 million for Ford, $5.7 million
for Chrysler, and $9.7 and $12.6 million for
Nissan and Toyota respectively. This analysis
suggests that Chrysler and Ford incur roughly
twice the transaction costs procuring parts as
Japanese automakers, while GM’s transaction
costs are six to eight times higher. These differences exist despite that fact that transaction-specific investments are considerably lower for the
U.S. automotive transactors. Furthermore, even
though Toyota’s supplier group was more specialized than Nissan’s, Toyota’s transaction costs
were roughly 20% lower than Nissan’s.
These findings can be interpreted as being
either consistent or inconsistent with extant transaction cost theory, depending on one’s point of
view. On the one hand, according to received
theory, a pair of transactors who employ generalpurpose assets in the exchange relationship should
incur lower transaction costs than competing
transactors who choose to make transaction-specific investments. Recall that Williamson ( 1991a:
282) has argued that ‘asset specificity increases
the transaction costs of all forms of governance.’

Our data show that in the auto industry this
relationship does not seem to hold. However,
one can argue that the relationship between asset
specificity and transaction costs will only hold if
environmental and other factors are held constant.
Variables such as the legal and institutional
environment (i.e., culture ) can influence opportunism and the nature of controls and safeguards
employed. Thus, one might simply argue that we
would expect asset specificity to be higher, and
transaction costs lower, in Japanese supply
relations because the environment is different.
The Japanese institutional environment may
reduce the prevalence of opportunism due to
informal constraints (Dore, 1983). Williamson
( 1985) would view the environment as a shift
parameter which must be held constant for
empirical work to be valid. Further, one can
argue that Japanese transactors have simply
chosen more efficient safeguards than U.S. transactors, and thus minimized transaction costs by
more effectively
aligning transactions
with
governance structures. Thus, the findings can be
interpreted as being consistent with transaction
cost theory.
However, the fact that GM (which employs an
arm’s length strategy with suppliers ) and Chrysler
(which is now employing a partnership approach
with suppliers) operate in the identical institutional environment and yet have dramatically

different transaction costs suggests that differences in the institutional environment cannot
solely explain these differences in transaction
costs. It seems possible that Williamson ( 1985)
may have significantly underestimated the longterm search and contracting costs associated with
managing arm’s length market transactions. But
regardless of whether these findings are interpreted as consistent or inconsistent with received
theory, an examination of why these results were
obtained is warranted.

AN EXPLORATORY STUDY:
BACKGROUND AND METHOD
The findings from this study were the catalyst
for an exploratory study designed to understand
why these results might have been obtained.
However, before describing the findings of the
exploratory phase of the study it is important to
note that differences in procurement costs across
automakers may be driven by a number of factors.
In particular, two factors which we would expect
to influence procurement costs are ( 1) automaker
size (volume ) and (2) the number and complexity
of models produced. For example, larger automakers should enjoy economies of scale in managing suppliers, thereby resulting in fewer personnel in procurement (per dollar of goods procured).

<-----Page 7----->542

J. H. Dyer

However, although GM is the largest automaker,
it had the highest transaction costs. Moreover,
Ford and Toyota are similar in size and yet
their procurement costs differ markedly. Although
there is likely to be a size effect, it does not
appear to be a major explanatory variable.
A second possible reason for transaction cost
differences might be due to differences in the
number of models produced and the complexity
of the models. For example, if GM produces
more models (per dollar of sales) with more
different types of components (i.e., perhaps due
to a differentiation strategy) then we might expect
more individuals required in procurement to manage that complexity. However, studies by Clark
and Fujimoto (1991) and Nishiguchi ( 1994) suggest that Japanese automakers have developed
more models (per million dollars of sales) than
their U.S. counterparts. Moreover, Japanese suppliers are more likely than U.S. suppliers to
develop unique parts for their customers.s Thus,
if we were to make a prediction based on component complexity/customization, these studies suggest that Japanese automaker transaction costs
should be higher than U.S. automaker transaction costs.
A third possible reason for transaction cost
differences
(i.e., between
GM and other
automakers) may be that GM has chosen a market
power strategy and is using a large procurement
staff to pit a large number of suppliers against
each other so that GM gets its inputs at the very
lowest price. Thus, GM may be trading off higher
transaction costs for lower cost inputs, thereby
lowering GM’s production costs. This, of course,
could be a viable (and not necessarily ineffective)
strategy. However, every piece of research evidence from the auto industry to date indicates
that GM does not get lower input prices from
suppliers. For example, Cusumano and Takeishi
(199 1) found that the input prices for Japanese
automakers were lower than those received by
U.S. automakers. Moreover, the input prices were
also declining faster for the Japanese automakers

8Clark and Fujimoto ( 1991) found that 38% of U.S. automaker parts were ‘off the shelf parts, while only 18% of
Japanese automaker parts were ‘off the shelf.’ Similarly,
Nishiguchi (1993) found that when a U.S. supplier develops
a component for a U.S. customer, the same auto component
is fitted into 8.3 car models. In contrast, Japanese suppliers
sell the identicat part for only 5.7 models, indicating higher
customization of Japanese auto parta for car models.

than the U.S. automakers. This held true even
when the Japanese transplants used U.S. suppliers.
Furthermore, Dyer (1996a) found that between
1982 and 1992 GM, and a sample of its suppliers,
were less profitable than Toyota, Nissan, Chrysler,
and Ford and their suppliers. GM’s pretax return
on assets (ROA) was 2.8% while Toyota’s was
13.0%. Further, GM’s suppliers’ ROA was 4.8%
while Toyota’s suppliers’ was 7.1 ~o. Again, if
GM’s strategy of obtaining lower input prices
was successful, we might expect it to have some
positive effect on GM’s profits since purchased
inputs represent a high percent of the value of
any automaker’s vehicle. Although it is possible
in theory that GM is trading off higher transaction
costs for lower input prices, in practice this does
not seem to be the case.
In summary, many of the factors (i.e., size and
complexity ) which we might expect to explain
transaction cost differences among automakers
did not offer compelling explanations for these
variances. Thus, other factors within Japanese
transaction relationships must explain how they
simultaneously achieve high asset specificity and
low transaction costs.9

Data collection
To understand why Toyota and Nissan had lower
transaction costs than their U.S. counterparts (as
well as why GM had higher transaction costs
than Ford or Chrysler), we conducted exploratory
interviews with both the suppliers and automakers. We conducted sernistructttred interviews with
each automaker’s general manager of procurement
as well as at least two other executives/ purchasing agents from each automaker. In addition, we
interviewed sales and engineering vice presidents
at 50 suppliers (20 Japanese and 30 U.S.
9 There may be two additional reasons, which we could not
control for, that U.S. firms (in particular GM) might have
lower procurement productivity. One is that GM may have
been too divisionalized. Until 1992 GM’s purchasing was
decentralized into a number of divisions. Since procurement
incurs fixed costs, separating the firm into many separate
d]visions may have created duplication of purchasing
resources. Our data were collected shortly afier purchasing
was centralized. Second. since productivity is also a function
of the degree of effective competition, the collusive behavior
of U.S. automakers joined to erect trade barriers against their
Japanese competitors may have increased the degree of slack
among U.S. automakers, thereby influencing procurement productivity.

suppliers ). Interviews were typically 2 hours in
length. The purpose of the interviews was to
explore the actions of the transactors that resulted
in an increase or decrease in the costs of transacting, namely search, contracting, monitoring,
and enforcement costs (see Appendix 1 for interview questions).
Data analysis
We coded the interview transcripts using constant
comparative analysis in which each comment or
event was assigned to an emergent open coding
scheme (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and
Corbin, 1990). Open coding is the process of
naming and categorizing of phenomena. During
open coding, the data are broken down into discrete concepts and compared for similarities and
differences. This produced 21 initial codes of
actions/behaviors
that influenced
transaction
costs. These were subsequently reduced into five
increasingly abstract categories through axial
coding (Strauss and Corbin, 1990). Although
open coding fractures the data and allows one
to identify numerous discrete concepts and their
properties, axial coding puts these data back
together in new ways by making connections
between subcategories and combining them into
categories. This is done by utilizing a coding
conditions,
context,
involving
pa.radlgm
action/interactional strategies, and consequences
(Strauss and Corbin, 1990: 60-115).
Validity
We used the processes involved in the constant
comparative method as internal checks on the
validity of the data. The process is described well
by Browning, Beyer, and Shetler (1995: 121):
As the research proceeds and new data are collected, they are constantly being compared to
prior data in terms of categories and hypotheses.
When new data yield new or inconsistent information, conceptual categories and the emerging
theory are modhied to take them into account.
This process is repeated until theoretical saturation is reached: until no new categories are
emerging and no new information inconsistent
with the categories and tentative hypotheses is
being generated (Glaser and Strauss, 1%7;
Strauss and Corbin, 1990).

validity are among informants and between
informants and archival sources. Only data that
were consistent across informants and sources
are reported here. However, to further verify the
accuracy of our analysis and interpretations, we
conducted a second phase of research which
involved collecting additional data from a larger
sample of suppliers. We developed a follow-up
survey based on the exploratory interviews and
sent it to the original 250 suppliers. Responses
were received from 118 (55 Japanese and 63
U.S. ) suppliers and these data are used to validate
the propositions developed during the exploratory
interviews. In the survey we operationalized the
various safeguards described in the first section
to determine which safeguards were most widely
used by suppliers–automakers
in each country
(see survey questions in Appendix 2). The data
from the interviews and surveys are the basis for
the propositions regarding how Japanese automotive transactors simultaneously achieve higher
asset specificity and lower transaction costs than
their U.S. counterparts (see Table 3 for a summary of data sources).

RESULTS: WHY JAPANESE
TRANSACTORS HAVE LOW
TRANSACTION COSTS
Through our interviews we identified five separate, but interrelated, propositions to explain the
differences in transaction costs among automakers. For simplicity in developing the propositions,
the remainder of the paper focuses primarily on
comparing Japanese transactors (Toyota and
Nissan) and U.S. transactors (GM, Ford, and
Chrysler). However, the propositions also serve
differences
between
GM and
to explain
Ford/Chrysler. 10 we ~gue that Japanese automakers have lower transaction costs than their
U.S. counterparts primarily due to:
1. repeated transactions with a small set of suppliers;
2. economies of scale and scope in transacting
with that small supplier group (high volume
of exchange between transactors);

4. the use of noncontractual, self-enforcing safeguards (i.e., goodwill trust) which are effective
for an indefinite time horizon (as opposed to
contracts which are effective for a finite time
horizon); and
5. investments in cospecialized assets.
The theoretical, and preliminary empirical, support for these propositions is offered below.
Repeated transactions with a small supplier
group
Japanese automakers work with a much smaller
group of suppliers than U.S. automakers and
engage in repeated exchange with those suppliers
(see Table 4). Our interviews suggest that repeatedly working with fewer suppliers results in low
transaction costs for three primary reasons. First,
empirically we found that Japanese suppliers rewin the business at a car model change over 90~o
of the time compared to Chrysler and Ford at
roughly 79Y0, and GM at 52%. By making the
transaction a repeated game, Japanese automakers
increase the cost of defection/opportunism on the
part of the supplier. 11 The cost of losing the

behavior is well documented in the game theory literature
(Axekod, 19S4; Parkhe, 1993). The prospect of continuing
interaction alters the pay-off structure and increases the cost
of ‘defection.’ Thus, the future casts a ‘shadow’ back upon
the present, affecting current behavior patterns. Cceper-ation
is promoted by the establishment of a direct connection

business is greater for suppliers with: ( 1) a higher
volume of exchange with the automaker, and
(2) the expectation of a long-term relationship.
As one Japanese supplier executive observed, ‘For
us to try to take advantage of Toyota would be
very short-sighted. We have too much business
with them to risk such a foolish action’ (author
interview, 1992). Thus, the cost of opportunism
is higher for the typical Japanese supplier than
for the typical U.S. supplier. The creation of a
high-volume, repeated game increases the ‘incentive compatibility’ of the transactors.
Second, a ‘repeated game’ allows for more
opportunities in the future to correct for transaction inequities, thereby reducing bargaining
costs. More than 7570 of the Japanese suppliers
interviewed indicated that they knew that if an
inequity emerged in the current set of transactions, it would be ‘remembered’ and corrected
in the future. The majority of U.S. suppliers
indicated that inequities were rarely, if ever,
remembered by the automakers. Japanese transactors are much more likely to rely on a ‘social
memory’ which is created through repeated interactions. This memory allows Japanese transactors
to achieve ‘serial equity’ (equity over a longer
period of time) rather than requiring immediate
or ‘spot equity’ (Ouchi, 1984). Thus, it reduces
the need for transactors to invest heavily in bargaining over profits from the current set of transactions.

between a transactor’s present actions and anticipated future
benefits.

Proposition

Economies of scale and scope in transacting
On average, Japanese suppliers sell much larger
volumes of goods to automakers than do U.S.
suppliers (see Table 4). The fact that Japanese
suppliers sell large volumes of product, as well
as multiple products (i.e., part numbers), to the
automaker reduces transaction costs in two ways.
First, the costs of sharing information go down
as a percentage of the vahte of goods exchanged
due to economies of scale in transacting. The
automaker typically must collect much of the
same information from the supplier (on martageprocesses,
etc. )
ment, finances, production
whether the automaker is buying $5 million or
$500 million of parts from the supplier. The
larger the absolute volume of goods exchanged,
the lower the transaction costs per unit of
exchange. Just as scale economies lead to lower
per unit production costs, economies of scale
associated
with increasing
the volume of
exchanges with a given transactor leads to lower
per unit costs associated with completing the
transaction.

Second, ex ante and ex post bargaining costs
are reduced because economies of scale and scope
in transacting provide many more options for
correcting transaction inequities. For example,
when suppliers bid on the business for a pwticular
component, they receive a projected unit volume
from the automaker on which they base their
costs and prices. Of course, this unit volume
is an estimate but the supplier must make the
investments in plant, tooling, manpower, etc. in
order to be able to produce the projected unit
volume. Automakers verify this investment before
production to ensure that all suppliers have the
ability to produce the parts they expect they will
need. Of course, in most cases the estimate is
incorrect-in
some cases too high and in some
cases too low. However, according to both suppliers and automakers, the estimate is much more
likely to be too high than too low. 12 In the
case of a particularly inaccurate estimate, it is
impossible for the supplier to fully recoup its
investments because the assets dedicated to production are not fully utilized (the supplier’s unit
price to the automaker was based on a unit

U.S. automakers’ estimates were
typically 20–30% too high while Japanese automaker estimates were more likely to be within 5-10% of actuat volume.

<-----Page 11----->546

J. H. Dyer

volume that did not materialize). The supplier
cart respond to this dilemma in a number of
ways. First, the supplier can simply ask for a
higher price ex ante which reflects the risk
involved. 13 Second, the supplier can insist on a
more complex, contingent claims contract to protect its interests and specify damages in the event
that the estimated unit volume does not
materialize. Or finally, the supplier can go back
to the automaker ex posr and ask for some type
of compensation.
When a supplier is only transacting with the
automaker on a small number of components (as
in the U.S.), these responses-which
result in
high transaction costs—are the only ones available to the supplier. However, because Japanese
suppliers typically sell multiple components for
multiple car models, ex ante precision is less
important, and ex post bargaining is less problematic. Japanese suppliers claimed that if the actual
unit volume for a particular model was lower
than expected, they typically did not worry about
it because they were usually selling a component
on another model where the estimate was low.
Thus, according to numerous Japanese supplier
executives, ‘the high and low estimates tend to
cancel each other out.’ In situations where the
automaker estimates were particularly inaccurate
and the supplier had made large investments that
could not be recouped, rather than engage in
expensive haggling on that particular component,
the supplier simply asked for additional business
on existing or upcoming models, perhaps at a
more favorable price. Consequently, Japanese
transactors spend less time on ex ante contracting
and ex post bargaining. Economies of scale and
scope in the transaction relationship lower transaction costs by providing more options to correct
for transaction inequities.
Proposition 2: The greater the total volume
of exchange between transactors, the lower the
transaction costs per unit of exchange.

situation it is virtually impossible

for suppliers to add in a risk premium and still win the
business. Most suppliers claim that they price based on the
automaker’s estimated volume and hope they will find other
ways to make up the shortfatl if the estimated volume does
not materialize.

Substantial information sharing
Japanese automotive transactors share more information than their U.S. counterparts, thereby
reducing information asymmetry as well as the
potential for opporhmism (see Table 5 ). This in
turn reduces transaction costs. The link between
information sharing and transaction costs is
straightfotward. In neoclassical economics, transaction costs are assumed to be zero because
transactors have perfect information. Information
asymmetry is necessary in order for transactors
to behave opportunistically. As North ( 1990 108)
observes, ‘the costs of transacting arise because
information is costly’ and ‘asymmetrically held
by the parties to the exchange.’ In a transaction
world of perfect information, transaction costs
are negligible.
The transaction world of Japanese automakers
more closely approximates a world of perfect
information. Japanese suppliers and automakers
share a tremendous amount of information on
their costs, methods of production, technology,
and so forth. This reduces the ability of transactors to behave opportunistically by concealing
relevant information
(Akerlof,
1970 North,
1990). The comment of a Japanese supplier
executive illustrates this point. When asked why
his company does not try to build additional
profit into the cost estimates that they provide to
Nissan, he answered as follows:
It would be vixtually impossible for us to get
away with inaccurate cost estimates. Nissan has
much data; they have very good information on
our operations and they can analyze our cost
position. They can visit our plants and gather
information. They know us and our operations
so well, they would surely discover it. Moreover,
tJrey have at least one other supplier that competes with us and they have detailed information
to compare us. We can hide nothing (author
interview, 8 August 1992)

Over 90910of the Japanese suppliers we interviewed answered this question in a similar manner. Indeed, the supplier selection process is such
that Japanese automakers ‘screen’ for suppliers
who are willing to share information. Suppliers
who are unwilling to share information are effectively screened out. 14lltis point is highlighted by
M~umment
managers at both Japanese automakers indicated that they screen for suppliers who are willing to share
information; suppliers who are unwilling to share information

I probably shouldn’t admit this but we actually
share more information with Toyota than we do

That’s just the way they do business. If we didn’t
give them the information they wanted, they

September 1992)

Japanese automakers demand significant cost,
quality, and production information from suppliers for two reasons. First, a supplier’s willingness to share information is viewed as a signal
of the trustworthiness of the supplier. Second,
they do not take for granted that the supplier can
perform as promised. Thus, they want to verify
the capabilities of the supplier. This high degree
of information sharing reduces information asymmetries, thereby reducing contracting and monitoring costs because both parties are negotiating
with similar information.

Use of self-enforcing vs. contractual
safeguards
Japanese automotive transactors do not control
opportunism through legal contracts but instead
rely on self-enforcing
safeguards
such as
relational trust and financial hostages (stock
ownership). These safeguards presumably have
high initial ‘set-up’ costs but once in place they
have relatively low maintenance costs. 15
Our supplier survey found that Japanese automakers, notably Toyota, have been more effective
than U.S. automakers at getting suppliers to trust
them (see Table 6). Japanese suppliers indicate
that they are more likely to trust Japanese automakers to treat them fairly. ‘b Further, Japanese

automaker tended to personalize the exchange which increased
goodwill trust (Sake, 1991). Japanese procurement personnel
indicated that long-term friendships and loyatty were factors
which prevented them from taking advantage of suppliers.

friendships and loyalty as reasons for cooperating with sup

suppliers were more willing to make investments
based upon the oral promises of the automaker,
without a written contract. Interestingly, GM was
significantly less likely to have fostered trust than
Chrysler or Ford. During interviews, suppliers
reported cases of patent infringement, sending
proprietary design blueprints to competitors, and
broken contracts as reasons that they did not trust
GM. Stated one supplier executive:
Three years ago we were honored by GM as a

high performance supplier. In fact, we were the
only supplier featured with a picture in their
annual report for our performance. But this year
they came back and said we would have to drop
our price 2070 in order to keep the business.
They said they had a lower bid. When we refused
to drop our price that much, they forced us to
ship the tools to a new supplier and even had
the nerve to ask us to help the new supplier to
get up and running.
Consistent with the hypothesis that ttust is an
efficient
governance
mechanism
(Dore,
1983;
Sake, 1991 ), these findings support an inverse

relationship between trust and transaction costs.
Finally, Japanese transactors are much more
likely to use financial hostages, rather than contracts, to make a credible commitment. For
example, Japanese automakers have minority
ownership positions in many key suppliers. Nis-

san and Toyota own an average of 2370 of the
stock of their affiliated suppliers and roughly 10?ZO
across all suppliers in our sample (Table 6). Stock
ownership in a Japanese trading relationship is
representative of a credible commitment that one
firm has made to another firm (Gerlach, 1992).
A stock ownership position held by an automaker
acts as a financial hostage which encourages the
supplier to make partner-specific investments. The
use of hostages increases the costs of unilateral
defection by the automaker and lengthens the
‘shadow of the future’ by signaling good-faith
intentions and long-term commitments (Schelling,
1978; Parkhe, 1993).
The short-term ‘set-up’ costs of building trust
or investing in financial hostages are high relative
to simply writing a legal contract to attenuate the
hazards of opportunism. However, once Japanese
transactors have made the upfront investment to
develop these self-enforcing safeguards, the transaction costs decline over the long term. Selfenforcing safeguards can control opportunism
over an irtdejinite time horizon. Conversely, contracts control opportunism for only a jinire time
horizon. When the finite duration of the contract
is over, transactors must find other means to
control opportunism (i.e., write a new contract).
In contrast to Japanese practice, U.S. automrtkers have historically worked with a large set of

<-----Page 14----->Eflective
suppliers and relied on legal contracts to control
opportunism. 17The pattern for U.S. auto companies has been to establish requirements and play
suppliers off against one another in a contest
for l-year contracts (Clark and Fujimoto, 1991).
Helper ( 1991) found that the average length of
a legal contract employed by a U.S. automaker
was only 2.3 years in 1989, up from 1.2 years
in 1984. This requires annual or biannual requests
for bids from suppliers followed by the subsequent costs of analyzing the bids, negotiating,
rebidding, selecting a supplier, and writing a legal
contract. In short, this practice leads to high
search and contracting costs. Two-thirds of GM
suppliers in our survey indicated that historically
GM has rebid their component before a model
change (Table 4). In contrast, Toyota and Nissan
rebid components less than 59to of the time. As
one GM executive noted, ‘It has been necessary
for us to maintain a large purchasing department
to manage the large number of suppliers and the
frequent rebidding of parts’ (author interview,
February 199 1). U.S. automakers continually face
the costs of recontracting with suppliers because
legal contracts are only efficacious for a finite
time period.
In summary, Japanese automotive transactors
minimize transaction costs by minimizing search,
contracting, monitoring, and enforcement costs
over the long term. They do this by controlling
opportunism
in their exchange relationships
through self-enforcing safeguards rather than legal
contracts. Conversely, U.S. automakers recontract
with an ever-changing line-up of suppliers and
thus continue to incur considerable search and
contracting costs. While a legal contract may
minimize transaction costs in the short run, the
safeguards used in Japanese alliances result in
lower transaction costs over the long run.
Proposition 4: Selj-enforcing safeguards (i.e.,
goodwill trust, jinancial hostages) result in
lower transaction costs than legal contracts if
the expected duration of exchange is long term.
Investments in relation-specific or
coqwialized assets
Helper and Levine ( 1992: 566) have observed
that ‘in much of the transaction-cost literature,
IT~o”gh this patternis changing significantly, especi~ly at
Chrysler (Kamath and Liker, 1994; Dyer, 1996c).

asset specificity is assumed to be exogenously
determined by the technology’ and ‘purchasers
always choose the socially efficient level of asset
specificity .. . Governance structure follows in a
straightforward way from the degree of asset
specificity.’ 18 However, our interviews suggest
that due to uncertainty and bounded rationality,
transactors
investment

do not know ex ante what level of
in specialized
assets will be optimal.

Within Japanese supplier–automaker
relationships, the level of investment in relation-specific
assets tends to deepen over time, particularly as
transactors make initial investments, share information, build trust, and ‘discover’ new ways to
enhance performance through relation-specific
assets, For example, a Nissan seat supplier
decided to build its plant on the property adjacent
to a Nissan assembly plant. This decision was
made primarily because Nissan had a minority
equity position in the supplier and the two parties
had developed a high level of relational trust.
Once this site-specific investment was made, the
two parties discovered that rather than transport
the seats by truck (a general purpose asset), it
would be more economical to build a conveyor
belt (a highly specialized asset) to carry the seats
directly from the supplier plant to the automaker
plant. Consequently, the supplier and automaker
jointly invested in building the conveyor belt.
This example of an initial specialized investment
(i.e., a site-specific plant) being followed by subsequent specialized investments (i.e., customized
equipment) is not unusual among Japanese
suppliers–automakers.
A high degree of information sharing and trust results in higher levels of
relation-specific investments because the parties
discover new ways to enhance performance
through specialized investments.
In addition, we found that the level of relationspecific investments made by suppliers was
strongly influenced by the automaker’s strategy
with regard to supplier management and governance. To illustrate, when suppliers considered
making a particular relation-specific investment
they asked the following question: ‘Will we make
the necessary return on investment during the
payback period or length of the transaction

18Willimson ( 1985: 34) has argued that reset specificity
(technology), contractual safegumds, and price are determined
‘simultaneously.’ Thus, asset specificity may be viewed as
partly endogenous in his model.

<-----Page 15----->550

agreement/contract? According to Japanese suppliers, a sizable portion of their automaker-specific investments in customized equipment, tools,
processes, and capacity had a payback period of
at least 8 years or two model cycles (most Toyota
and Nissan models have a 4-year development
cycle). Thus, for the investment to pay off, the
supplier needed to be assured that it would be
awarded the component business for at least 8
years. Japanese automakers provided those assurances by giving credible long-term commitments
to suppliers (as evidenced by the high re-win
rates ). In contrast, U.S. suppliers considered the
duration of the legal contract as the payback
period-which
was typically 5 years or less.
Thus, U.S. suppliers rationally refused to make
relation-specific investments with a payback
period longer than the length of the contract. The
practical result of these differences in governance
strategy was that a larger set of durable relationspecific investments made economic sense for
Japanese suppliers than for U.S. suppliers.
Thus, firm-level (buyer) strategies towards
governance ultimately influences both ~ransactkm
and production costs. If one supplier uses special
purpose technologies and assets for production
while another refuses to do so due to concerns
regarding opportunism, the suppliers will have
different production costs. 19 Governance of supplier relauons has an effect on production costs
by influencing the level of relation-specific investments employed in the relationship. Thus, investments in specific assets are at least partly
endogenously determined. These findings suggest
that asset specificity is not the cause, but to a
large degree the consequence of governance strategy.
Finally, because Japanese automakers and suppliers often made symmetrical or cospecialized
investments it resulted in a hostage situation,
thereby increasing the interdependence of the
transactors (Klein, 1980; Williamson, 1983; Dyer
and Ouchi, 1993). Cospecialized investments
increase the transactors’ interdependence and,
consistent with theory, serves as an economic
rationale for cooperative, long-term relationships.
19 ~i~
finding
is Consisknt
with Lyons ( 1994). who found
that 60% of U.K. transactors in the engineering field claimed
that they were not utilizing the optimal level of specialized
investments with their main customer, primarily because they
were unwilling to expose themselves to the risk of being
oppofiunisticrdly exploited.

Of course, transactors will not make the initial
investments unless they feel sufficiently protected
against the hazards of opportunism. Thus, trartsaction costs increase with initial investments in
specialized assets. However, once a high level of
trust is achieved and the initial relation-specific
investments are made, subsequent investments
serve as a credible signal of trust and commitment. Thus, they are self reinforcing. Specific
investments, by their very nature, increase the
‘shadow of the future’ and increase the expectation of future interaction, thereby leading to a
pattern of cooperative behavior (Heide and Miner,
1992; Parkhe, 1993). Thus, we propose a curvilinear relationship between asset specificity and
transaction costs with trust as a moderating variable (see Figure 1). During the early stages of a
relationship, transaction costs increase as transactors invest in safeguards to protect initial investments in specific assets. However, once a sufficiently high level of trust is achieved and
specialized investments are made, the investments
themselves serve as a signal of trust and commitment. Thus, transaction costs may actually
decrease with increased investments in specific
assets.
Proposition 5: Above some minimum threshold level of trust, aaliitional relation-specific
investments serve to increase commitment and
the costs of unilateral defection, thereby
resulting in lower transaction costs.
A model of interfhm collaboration and value
maximization
Figure 2 proposes a model of interfirm collaboration that maximizes transaction value based on
the propositions developed previously. The model
proposed here suggests that the credibility of a
firm’s promise to behave cooperatively increases
as transactors: ( 1) demonstrate through behavior
a commitment to fiture interaction (e.g., by
increasing the re-win rate and volume of
exchange), (2) increase the amount of information
sharing, and (3) employ self-enforcing safeguards
to govern the relationship. In turn, an increase in
‘promise credibility’ (or trustworthiness) within
the trading relationship reduces transaction costs
and increases the likelihood that transactors will
invest in relation-specific assets. Furthermore,
increased investments in specialized assets serve

A model of interfirm collaboration

to reinforce the transactors’ promise credibility
by increasing the cost of unilateral defection and
lengthening ‘tie ‘shadow of the future.’zo Finally,
lower transaction costs and greater investments
in specialized assets maximize transaction value,
or the joint performance of the transactors.

m In support of this proposition, Smith and Aldrich ( 1991:
28) found that asset specificity created trust by increasing
information sharing between suppliers and buyers.

CONCLUSION
This study suggests that transaction costs do not
necessarily increase with an increase in relationspecific investments. Empirically we found that
Japanese automakers incur lower transaction costs
than U.S. automakers even though their suppliers
are more specialized to them. Through exploratory interviews we developed a number of propositions to explain these results. In particular, we
found that transaction costs differ among automakers due to: ( 1) differences in their commit-

<-----Page 17----->552

J. H. Dyer

ment to suppliers to engage in repeated exchange,
(2) differences in the scale and scope of
exchanges between the supplier and automaker,
(3) differences in interfirm information sharing,
(4) differences in the mix of safeguards chosen
to govern the exchange, notably a reliance on
self-enforcing safeguards which are efficacious
over an indefinite time horizon (as opposed to
contracts which are only effective for a finite
time horizon), and (5) differences in investments
in cospecialized assets. We have suggested that
these propositions are interrelated, meaning that
they are highly correlated and mutually reinforcing. For example, engaging in repeated transactions (Proposition 1) is important for achieving
high volume/scale
economies (Proposition 2),
sharing information (Proposition 3), developing
self-enforcing safeguards (Proposition 4), and discovering new ways to enhance performance
through specialized assets (Proposition 5). We
presume that each proposition holds true if each
of the other propositions is held constant, but it
may be that in order to significantly reduce transaction costs these actions must be taken in combination.
These findings also have implications for how
firms in a production network can maximize
transaction value. In particular, a production network that can simultaneously achieve the twin
benejits of asset specialization and lower transaction costs will have efficiency advantages over
a less specialized network with higher transaction
costs. Williamson ( 1985: 1) has remarked that
‘the transaction cost approach maintains that these
institutions [governance structures ] have the main
purpose and effect of economizing on transaction
costs.’ Indeed, the fundamental governance question, as posed by Williamson, is: How can
exchange relationships be structured to economize
on transaction costs?z 1 However, as Zajac and
Olsen (1993 ) have suggested, this may be the
wrong question. Instead, the fimdamental question
should be: How can exchange relations be struc-

2I It is w.ofi noting that there are a number of transaction
cost scholars who do not espouse the view that optimat
governance is the one that minimizes transaction costs, but
that the institutional arrangement chosen is the one that
maximizes the gains from trade. For example, Hennart ( 1993)
argues that the efficient institutional arrangement is the one
which results in the highest midual, a statement equivalent to
saying that the optimal institution is the one which maximizes
transaction value.

(which

includes both production and transaction costs )?
Our study suggests that beyond minimizing transaction costs, governance influences transaction
value by influencing the transactors’ set of
choices regarding the level of specialized assets
that will be employed. For example, a firm’s
promise credibility (trustworthiness) can be a
source of advantage because it minimizes transaction costs. However, at least as important is
the fact that trustworthiness will often result in
higher levels of performance-enhancing
investments in specialized assets because trustworthy
transactors: (1) engage in greater information
sharing which increases the probability that they
will discover new ways to enhance performance
through relation-specific investments, (2) have a
longer payback period during which to eam a
return on the investments, thereby increasing the
number of relation-specific investments that make
economic sense, and (3) are able to implement
optimal levels of specialized assets because the
costs of safeguarding the relation-specific investments are less likely to outweigh the gains. Thus,
efficient governance mechanisms (i.e., must) can
simultaneously
lower transaction costs and
increase relation-specific investments, thereby creating competitive advantage.
However, it is important to note that Japanese
procurement practices will only pay off if there
are gains to be obtained from making relationspecific investments. If parts manufacture would
not benefit from such investments, then U.S. practices may be more efficient. Furthermore, building
trust and engaging in repeated trades is not
costless. At some point Japanese transactors
had to incur the ‘set-up costs’ associated with
establishing noncontractual governance mechanisms. Moreover, the cost of building trust
includes the opportunity cost of not taking
advantage of one’s suppliers and the loss of
the opportunity to use lower-cost suppliers if
they came along. Thus, Japanese procurement
practices are not absolutely superior. They may
be superior only in the long term, and only
if relation-specific investments create economic
value. Hence, Japanese procurement practices
may be optimal given a rather specific set of
conditions. However, when these conditions
exist (as they do in the auto industry), the
practices described in this paper represent a
model for effective interfirm collaboration.
