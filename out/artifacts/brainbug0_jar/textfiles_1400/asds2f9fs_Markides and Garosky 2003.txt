<-----Page 0----->Imagine the following scenario: you wake up one
morning and decide that you don’t like the way
your 70-year old parents look. Nor do you think
they live an active-enough life. You decide that
what they really need is a change – instead of golf,
they should take up squash; instead of looking like
70-year olds, they should adopt a dietary and
fitness regime that would make them look young
again; and instead of spending their time watching
TV, they should visit the gym twice a day. You are
so determined to achieve this transformation that
you invest most of your free time in it, urging your
parents along and giving them advice what to do
and when. In your quest to make them teenagers
again you know no boundaries.

“innovative” they are, we have come up with all
these “valuable” ideas and advice to make them
more entrepreneurial so that they too – like all
those agile and pioneering start-up firms – can
create new markets and lay the foundations for
the industries of the future.

How stupid does this sound? Yet this is exactly
what we have been trying to do with big,
established companies. Not satisfied with how

Unfortunately, the probability that such a thing will
happen is equal to the probability that you will
convert your parents into teenagers again – zero.

How? By developing the cultures and structures
of the younger, start-up firms. Look, we tell them,
don’t you want to be like Body Shop or Cisco or
Virgin? All you have to do is adopt their
structures, cultures and processes. Who says
elephants can’t dance? Just go on a diet and lose
some of that excess weight, learn a few tricks
from the younger firms and off you go.

other silly ideas
Established companies do not have the skills, mindsets or attitudes to create new markets. Nor
can they easily adopt the attitudes and mindsets necessary for market creation because these
attitudes and mindsets conflict with the ones they currently have and need in their existing
businesses. However, say Costas Markides and Paul Geroski, they do have the skills, mindsets and
attitudes that are ideal for taking new market niches developed by others and scaling them up
into mass markets.

<-----Page 1----->It’s not that the advice is bad. If we ignore who
the recipient of the advice is for a moment, we
cannot but marvel at the logic of the advice. For
example, Gary Hamel has proposed ideas such as
making the strategy process democratic and
bringing Silicon Valley inside the organisation as
ingredients to strategic innovation – who can
argue with that? Similarly, one of the authors of
this article has argued that corporations could
learn from the success of the capitalist system by
importing into their organisations those features
of capitalism (such as decentralised allocation of
resources, multiple sources of financing and
constant experimentation) that promote
innovation – sensible stuff indeed.
And others have advocated the creation of
separate units or divisions within an established
organisation where new disruptive-growth
businesses could be nurtured. These are all logical
and creative ideas. But they will not work when it
comes to creating new markets.

Think about it. Even a cursory comparison of the
markets that established competitors inhabit and
a market that has just been created should alert
us to the fact that these are wildly different
beasts. Is it sensible to expect the same
organisation to develop the requisite skills and
attitudes to manage such extremes effectively?
(The point we are making here is not new. As
early as 1961, Burns and Stalker made a similar
point in their book The Management of Innovation.)
We have recently researched a number of
industries to understand how new markets get
created and how they evolve. Not surprisingly,
there is a world of difference between what
established firms need to do to be successful and
what pioneers need to do.
Established firms compete in markets where
success is based on cost advantages, clever
segmentation of the existing customer base,
effective control of distribution and strong
branding.

First the bad news
The problem is not that established firms do not
agree with these ideas or that they do not want to
adopt them. On the contrary, they will find our
recommendations (such as developing cultures
that encourage experimentation or making their
strategy process democratic or even developing a
self-cannibalising attitude) constructive and useful.
But despite agreeing with all of this, they will not
succeed in adopting these attitudes and cultures.
This is because they already have the set of skills
and attitudes that they need to compete
successfully in their existing businesses. This set
of skills and attitudes makes them good at
exploitation, which is exactly what they need to
do well in their mature businesses. Now, all of a
sudden, we want them to also adopt a set of skills
and attitudes that will make them good explorers.
But the skills and attitudes needed for exploration
co-exist uneasily with the skills and attitudes
needed for exploitation – the two often conflict
with each other. Attempting to bring on board the
skills of exploration will most likely create a
reaction from the organisation. Its antibodies will
go to work and the new skills and attitudes will
be rejected as unwanted foreign organs.

Not surprisingly, there
is a world of difference
between what established
firms need to do to be
successful and what
pioneers need to do
50 Business Strategy Review Autumn 2003 ● Volume 14 Issue 3

What they need is a culture that promotes costcutting and manufacturing excellence; a structure
that sets clear boundaries and lines of
responsibility; systems and operating controls that
keep a tight lid on costs while collecting and
exploiting valuable customer information for
marketing purposes; incentives that reward
efficiency and discourage “unnecessary”
experimentation; people that have strong marketing
and manufacturing skills and who are happy to
play according to the rules; and efficiency-oriented
units that have relatively short time horizons but
formalised roles and linking mechanisms.
Pioneers, on the other hand, compete in volatile
and unpredictable markets characterised by high
technological and customer uncertainty and high
turnover.
What they need is a culture that promotes
experimentation and risk-taking; a loose and
decentralised product structure with limited
hierarchy; internal processes directed towards the
generation, selection and development of ideas;
planning processes that are flexible and
adaptable; incentives that reward new ideas and
do not punish failures; people that are
enthusiastic about new technologies and are eager
to bet on seriously speculative projects in an
effort to push the technological frontier beyond
current knowledge; and small, entrepreneurial
task-oriented teams that try out experiments
without worrying about efficiencies or profits.
One can imagine the complexity of trying to set
up structures, cultures and processes that
facilitate exploitation of the firm’s mature
businesses on the one hand while encouraging the
exploration of new markets on the other hand.
Though not impossible, this is so difficult that
Teaching elephants how to dance and other silly ideas

<-----Page 2----->Established firms may
not be very good at

but, truth be told,
they don’t need to be

firms that attempt to do it risk getting “stuck in
the middle.” Perhaps this is the reason that has
prompted several thinkers lately to advise
established companies to “outsource” innovation.
Therefore, to repeat our argument: established
firms do not have the necessary cultures,
structures and attitudes to succeed in creating (or
exploring) new markets. Even worse, attempting
to “learn” or “adopt” the skills and attitudes of
an explorer will not do them any good – the skills
and attitudes that they currently have (and need)
to compete successfully in their mature businesses
cannot easily co-exist with the skills and
competencies needed for exploration.
This means that attempting to incorporate the
new skills in the existing organisation can
produce only one of two outcomes. Either the
existing culture and attitudes reject the new
transplants; or the transplanted skills and attitudes
take over and destroy the very things that have
made the established firm a success (and which it
still needs to be successful in its existing business).
Either way, the outcome is unpalatable.
This might help explain a paradox in strategic
innovation: despite a wealth of ideas and advice
on how to strategically innovate, it is very rare to
find strategic innovations that have been created
by big, established firms. For example, in a recent
book on radical innovation, (subtitled: “How
mature companies can outsmart start up firms”),
Leifer et al ask: “How many big companies
pioneered the technologies and business models
that now dominate e-commerce, personal
computing, biotech and wireless communications?”
The answer, according to the authors, is none. All
available evidence shows that the majority of
strategic innovations are introduced by
newcomers in an industry (rather than established
competitors). Now we know why.

Now the good news
No need to despair. Established firms may not be
very good at creating new markets but, truth be
told, they don’t need to be. Why? Because
creating new markets is not necessarily the best
strategy for them. What we have seen in our
examination of how new markets get created and
how they evolve is that the companies (or
Teaching elephants how to dance and other silly ideas

individuals) that create new markets are not
usually the ones that end up dominating these
markets. Rather, it is the companies that time
their entry into new markets perfectly, to coincide
with the birth of the mass market. Most of the
time, pioneering simply does not pay.
Amazing as it may sound, the widely held belief
that pioneers enjoy first-mover advantages and
grow to market dominance is not correct. When
we completed our research, one of our findings
that stood out was that the companies that created
new markets were unlikely to be the ones that
ended up dominating those markets. To the
contrary, most (if not all) of the pioneers in a new
market disappeared without a trace. The
companies that ended up dominating a new
market were not those that created the market nor
were they the ones that rushed to enter it first.
Rather, it was the companies that timed their entry
to coincide with the growth of the mass market.
Now, this assertion might strike many readers as
extravagant. Granted, the universally accepted
view that pioneering is a superior strategy has
received some criticism lately by researchers. But
to claim that pioneering almost never pays?
Surely this cannot be true.
Yet, this is exactly the picture that emerges if we
examine how new markets get created and how
they evolve.
For example, there have been more than 1,000
companies in the US car industry at one time or
another and more than 100 emerged in the first
15 years of this new market’s life. Yet it was
Henry Ford who conquered the market almost 30
years after its creation, even though Ford was
neither the first nor the only producer of cars in
the US at the turn of the century. All the early

markets are

pioneers disappeared quietly and nobody has
heard of them since.
We’ve seen this pattern repeat itself in industry
after industry. On the creation of a new market
there’s a mad rush of entry to colonise it. At some
stage in the evolution of the market, a “dominant
product design” emerges. As a result, those
pioneering firms that happened to bet on this
winning design survive; all others die.
The dominant design is a basic template or “core
good” that defines what the product is. Effectively,
the winning design wins because it is cheaper,
widely available and, therefore, an easy choice for
consumers confronted by excessive variety. The
problem for most pioneers who rushed into the
market is that the arrival of the dominant design
signals their death. All those firms that rushed in,
trying their luck with all kinds of possible
product designs, eventually exit the market when
their designs lose out to the dominant design.
It is important to repeat and emphasise three
points from all this:
● First, note that very few of the original
entrants (the pioneers) survive the
consolidation of the market – most disappear,
never to be heard of again
● Second, the consolidators who win in the end
are almost never the first into the new market.
Their success is based on not moving fast but
in choosing the right time to move – and that
is rarely first
● Third, the things that consolidators do – such
as entering at the right time, standardising the
product, cutting prices, scaling up production,
creating distribution networks, segmenting the
market, spending huge amounts of money on
advertising and marketing – are exactly the
kinds of things that create what we (somewhat
inaccurately) call “first-mover advantages”.
By doing these things, consolidators create
52 Business Strategy Review Autumn 2003 ● Volume 14 Issue 3

buyer loyalty, get pre-emptive control of scare
assets, go down the learning curve, create
brands and reputation, and enjoy economies
of scale – all of which give them the advantage
versus potential new entrants. Thus, even
though colonists are chronologically first into
the market, consolidators are the “real” first
movers – they are the first to the market that
counts: the mass market.
What does all this mean for us? Simple: the
creators and early pioneers of new markets are
almost never the ones that conquer the market.
If that is the case, why should established
companies worry about creating new markets?
Why should they listen to any of our advice, trying
to convert them into innovators and pioneers? Are
they not better off either waiting till the mass
market is about to develop and then jumping into
that market or, even better, creating the mass
market themselves? The latter strategy, as we argue
below, is in fact the area where mature firms have
a competitive advantage over new, start-up firms.
It goes without saying that this should, therefore,
be the strategy they should focus on.

Even better news!
And the news keeps getting better. Not only does
it not matter that established firms are bad at
creating new markets but, even better for them,
they have the skills and competencies that allow
them to excel in what is really the key in
conquering new markets – taking an early market
out of the hands of the pioneers and scaling it up
into a mass market.
This is not automatic or a matter of luck.
Creativity and hard work is required if a newlycreated market is to actually grow into a mass
market. The world is littered with promising and
exciting market niches that have never made the
big breakthrough into stardom simply because
nobody did the right things to grow them.
What exactly is required to grow market niches
into mass markets? Our research has uncovered
the following strategies:
●

early adopters) by emphasising different
product attributes to those that the pioneers
focus on. In particular, emphasise low prices

●

Build the distribution that can serve the
mass market
Create alliances with key suppliers and
producers of complementary goods so as to

advantages

Now, let’s ask ourselves the question: what kind
of firms have the necessary financial resources,
the market power and reputation needed, the
brand-building skills, and the manufacturing and
marketing skills to achieve this?
The answer should be straightforward: it is the big,
established companies that have all these skills and
competencies. The very firms that we have come to
call bureaucratic and/or dinosaurs are the ones that
are perfectly positioned to take a niche market and
scale it up into a big, mass market.
Remember all those pioneers who rushed into new
markets only to lose out to those firms that timed
their entry to perfection and conquered the market
by standardising the product, cutting prices,
scaling up production, creating distribution
networks, segmenting the market and spending
huge amounts of money on advertising and
marketing? Well, these are exactly the kind of
things that established firms are good at. Why not
focus on the things that give them a competitive
edge over the start-up firms and, by the way,
allow them to dominate the new market?
Taking a new market and scaling it up is as
important and value-creating an activity as
discovering the new market in the first place.
Unfortunately, while everybody seems to know –
and celebrate – what inventors and pioneers do
few people seem to appreciate that consolidation
is equally (if not more) innovative. Henry Ford
did not discover the car nor did he create the
initial niche in which it was sold. Yet without his
genius in creating a new way of making cars, the
mass market in cars that emerged after 1909 may
not have emerged for another decade or two.
Therefore, to repeat our thesis: scaling up a
market is an important activity that requires as
much creativity and innovation as the discovery
of new markets. It is also the area where
established firms have an advantage over start-up
firms because they happen to have the requisite
skills and competencies to convert niche markets
into mass markets. This, therefore, should be the
area they focus on. This is how big established
firms innovate. ■
