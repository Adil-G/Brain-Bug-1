ntrepreneurs play a fundamental role in bringing new technologies to market. Because technologies are
often conﬁgurable to serve a variety of different markets, it is possible for entrepreneurs to identify multiple
market opportunities prior to the ﬁrst market entry of their emerging ﬁrms, and if they elect to do so, to therefore
have a choice of which market to enter ﬁrst. The empirical results presented in this paper offer three new insights
regarding this important early-stage choice in new ﬁrm creation. First, they reveal that serial entrepreneurs have
learned through prior start-up experience to generate a “choice set” of alternative market opportunities before
deciding which one to pursue in their new ﬁrm creation. Second, the analysis indicates that entrepreneurs who
identify a “choice set” of market opportunities prior to ﬁrst entry derive performance beneﬁts by doing so.
Third, the positive relationship between the number of market opportunities identiﬁed prior to ﬁrst entry and
new ﬁrm performance is nonlinear and subject to decreasing marginal return. The research literature has yet to
acknowledge the notion of multiple opportunity identiﬁcation prior to entry, and the related idea of selecting
the most favorable market opportunity for the creation of a new technology ﬁrm.

Introduction

entrepreneur seeking to establish her new ﬁrm as a
prospering economic entity, the failure to identify a
major market opportunity prior to ﬁrst entry may be
particularly problematic.
Research that could provide further insights on the
technology-to-market linking problem in new ﬁrm
creation is surprisingly scant (Helfat and Lieberman
2002), given that this problem is of considerable theoretical interest for the entrepreneurship, strategy, and
organizational literatures (Dougherty 1992) and is also
of high practical relevance (Jolly 1997, Shane 2004).
Beyond the value creation aspect, the choice of which
market to enter is one of the most profound organizational decisions entrepreneurs are faced with, because
the nature of the market has strong imprinting effects
on a new ﬁrm’s identity, the capabilities and assets
it needs to build, and its organizational structure
(Boeker 1989).
Drawing from the literatures on learning and innovation and resource-based theory, the purpose of
this paper is to advance theoretical understanding of the technology-to-market linking problem in
new ﬁrm creation. We address two important yet
unanswered questions. First, against the backdrop
of recent studies that uncover important effects of

A growing number of studies highlight the fact
that new technology ﬁrms are an important source
of innovation and wealth creation (Shane 2004).
Before entrepreneurs can exploit the value inherent in
their technological competences, however, they need
to identify at least one market domain in which
their technologies meet customer demand. Notably,
because technological competences may create beneﬁts for end users in multiple market domains (Penrose
1959, Prahalad and Hamel 1990, Jolly 1997, Danneels
2007), by identifying more than one market opportunity, entrepreneurs might be able to select the most
favorable market conditions for new ﬁrm creation.
However, due to limited prior knowledge of markets in which a technological competence may be
valued, the identiﬁcation of multiple market opportunities prior to the ﬁrst entry appears to be fairly uncommon among nascent entrepreneurs. Shane (2000)
shows that in a set of eight entrepreneurs who
sought to commercialize a technology from MIT,
none identiﬁed more than one market opportunity,
although at least eight different markets existed.
Intriguingly, these market opportunities offered highly
diverging prospects for value creation. Hence, for an

prior entrepreneurial experience on the process of
opportunity identiﬁcation (McGrath and MacMillan
2000, Baron and Ensley 2006), we seek to understand
whether serial entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals who are
proﬁcient in new ﬁrm creation) have developed particular approaches to the technology-to-market linking problem and the associated search for market
opportunities. Speciﬁcally, we examine whether serial
entrepreneurs identify more market opportunities for
their technologies prior to ﬁrst entry—i.e., construct
a larger choice set—than novice entrepreneurs. Second, there is a major gap in our understanding
of whether entrepreneurs may indeed beneﬁt from
the identiﬁcation of multiple market opportunities.
Whereas the MIT example shows that market opportunities stemming from the same technology may
have substantially different value creation characteristics (Shane 2000), there is also research that suggests
that entrepreneurs may not be able to select effectively between opportunities or may not be able to
exploit opportunities that are more distant from their
current knowledge base. We thus investigate whether
the identiﬁcation of multiple market opportunities
prior to ﬁrst market entry leads to superior performance outcomes in new ﬁrm creation. We address
these research questions using an original data set of
83 venture capital (VC)-backed technology ventures.
The scarcity of studies on the technology-to-market
linking problem in new ﬁrm creation conceivably
warrants any addition to the literature. We believe
that several insights of the present study make a contribution. Most important, our ﬁndings reveal that a
key element of commercialization learned by technology entrepreneurs through prior start-up experience
is to generate a choice set of alternative market opportunities before deciding which opportunity to pursue ﬁrst. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that
entrepreneurs can derive performance beneﬁts from
the identiﬁcation of a set of market opportunities
prior to ﬁrst entry, and that a positive yet nonlinear relationship exists between the number of market opportunities identiﬁed (i.e., the size of the choice
set) and ﬁrm performance. We proceed with a discussion of the theoretical background and develop our
hypotheses in §3. We describe the estimation methodology and the data in §4 and present the empirical
results in §5. Section 6 concludes the paper.

Theoretical Background: Linking
New Technologies with
Market Opportunities

In its most basic form, technology-to-market linking can be seen as the combination of technological
knowledge with information on market demand, i.e.,
end-user domains where the technology, as embodied

1653

in a product, can be meaningfully employed and can
create beneﬁts for its users (Dougherty 1992, Danneels
2002). To understand the technology-to-market linking problem in new ﬁrm creation, it is necessary to
delineate the components of this problem.
2.1.

Technological Competences and
Their Fungibility
Following Mitchell (1992), technological competence
typically stems from a combination of tangible and
intangible technically related resources. The idea that
technological competences are fungible and can create
beneﬁts for end users in multiple market domains is
ﬁrmly anchored in the resource-based view in strategic management. As a case in point, Penrose (1959,
p. 25) observed that “(e)xactly the same resource
when used for different purposes or in different ways
and in combination with different types or amounts of
other resources provides different service (  ).” Subsequently, many authors have noted that technological competences lie upstream from the end product
and transcend any particular product (e.g., Prahalad
and Hamel 1990, Danneels 2007). Because a ﬁrm’s
technological competence is distinct from the products in which it is embodied, it may be utilized in a
range of applications, and thus leveraged across different market domains.1
At this point it is important to note that the range
of market opportunities emerging from a new technology and thus the generality of a technological competence are rarely clear from the outset, because they
depend on people’s (ingenious) efforts in technological competence building and market opportunity identiﬁcation (Penrose 1959). First, from a technology perspective, fungibility depends on how far and in what
direction the knowledge components embodied in a
new technology are recombined with other bits of technological knowledge (Fleming and Sorenson 2004).
Whereas some elements of a technological competence
are speciﬁc to a particular application area, others are
of a more general nature and have implications for
products in a great array of markets. Hence, although
research and development efforts may be focused on
particular applications, emerging technologies may be
untangled, altered, and integrated with other knowledge bases in order to be transformed into a more
general, or more speciﬁc, type of technological competence (Galunic and Rodan 1998, Danneels 2007). Second, from a market perspective, fungibility depends
on the identiﬁcation of different markets in which the
same type of technological functionality is valued, and
thus on the extensiveness of the search process and
1
The logic behind this argument corresponds to the rationale for
related diversiﬁcation (e.g., Miller 2006), which involves expansion
into different markets based on shared organizational competences.

the ingenuity that founders apply in their explorations.
To identify promising market opportunities, a complex
array of insights into application domains and customer needs must be gathered (Dougherty 1992).

2.2.

Acquiring Knowledge on
Market Opportunities
The acquisition of knowledge on market opportunities can be conceptualized as an organizational search
problem. In the organizational learning literature,
search activities are considered instrumental for ﬁrms’
adaptation to environmental change and the identiﬁcation of opportunities to enhance performance.
Building on March and Simon (1958), local search is
deﬁned as the behavior of a ﬁrm in seeking solutions in the immediate neighborhood of its existing
stock of knowledge. Because local search is associated
with less-risky search activities, it is the most commonly used algorithm in technological search (Stuart
and Podolny 1996). In terms of market search, this
suggests that entrepreneurs tend to identify a market opportunity either known to them in the past, or
closely related to their existing stock of prior knowledge (Shane 2000). At the other end of the spectrum, distant search (also referred to as exploration)
is deﬁned as the behavior of people attempting to
build new knowledge bases (March 1991). To conduct a distant search, entrepreneurs need to engage
in some form of boundary spanning and bridge disparate knowledge domains (Miller et al. 2007).
The process of market search and its outcome
depend on whether one assumes rational or boundedly rational behavior by founders. In a classic model
of rational decision making, founders are assumed
to explore the complete landscape and evaluate the
whole set of alternatives for linking their technological resources with market opportunities (Janis and
Mann 1977). Behavioral decision theorists stress, however, that people’s search activities are strongly inﬂuenced by cognitive and social phenomena (Cyert and
March 1963). Speciﬁcally, individuals have limited
information-processing capacity, which can readily be
exceeded when they perform complex tasks such as
organizational searches. This deﬁciency is augmented
by the uncertainty, resource constraints, and time
pressures experienced in new ﬁrm creation. Realistically, one can thus expect individuals to engage in
a boundedly rational search by employing simpliﬁed representations of search landscapes and decision
heuristics (Gavetti and Levinthal 2000).
If boundedly rational founders cannot readily identify all solutions, the question becomes how many
do they identify before they terminate their search
for market opportunities? Behavioral decision theory
suggests that actors search for alternatives until they
identify one that is good enough to meet an initial

Management Science 54(9), pp. 1652–1665, © 2008 INFORMS

set of requirements, i.e., they satisﬁce (Simon 1982).
Search is seen to commence when the newly identiﬁed alternative does not meet the aspiration levels of
founders, and to stop when a satisfying alternative
has been identiﬁed. In new ﬁrm creation such differences in aspiration levels may be most evident when
comparing founders who seek to create “lifestyle ventures” with those attempting to create high-growth,
VC-backed businesses. What is considered a satisfactory alternative is typically a function of an actor’s
prior experience and her observation of other referent
organizations (Greve 2003).

3.

Hypotheses

The preceding discussion indicates that the initial
market choice is one of the most profound decisions
in the early life of ﬁrms and that some heterogeneity can be expected in how extensively entrepreneurs
engage in a market opportunity search prior to
ﬁrst entry. Extending this discussion, our hypotheses
study two critical yet hitherto unaddressed questions.
First, against a backdrop of recent research, which has
uncovered that serial entrepreneurs possess special
insights on opportunity identiﬁcation (McGrath and
MacMillan 2000, Baron and Ensley 2006), we seek to
understand whether they also possess special insights
on the technology-to-market linking problem in new
ﬁrm creation. We ask whether they identify more
market opportunities for their technological competences prior to ﬁrst entry—i.e., construct a larger
choice set—than novice entrepreneurs. Second, theory
offers strongly conﬂicting arguments regarding the
core question of whether entrepreneurs may indeed
beneﬁt from the identiﬁcation of multiple opportunities prior to ﬁrst entry (cf. March 1991, Peteraf
and Bergen 2003). Our second set of hypotheses thus
investigates the relationship between preentry market
opportunity search and postentry performance.
3.1.

Prior Entrepreneurial Experience and
Market Opportunity Search
Individuals who create new ﬁrms are equipped with
a stock of knowledge that they can apply in the
process. Because new ﬁrms in technology-intensive
industries are typically founded by teams, it is the
preexisting knowledge of the founding team that
affects the knowledge available to the ﬁrm, the ability of the team to access and use the knowledge,
its information-gathering and information-processing
behavior, and the number and variety of solutions
that will be generated (Pelled et al. 1999). One particularly important type of preexisting knowledge is
the knowledge that has been acquired through prior
entrepreneurial experience, because repeat founders
can draw on high levels of task-speciﬁc knowledge and may have obtained special insights on the

<-----Page 4----->Gruber, MacMillan, and Thompson: Market Opportunity Identiﬁcation in Emerging Technology Firms

entrepreneurial process. Because prior entrepreneurial
experience has many tacit components that are
learned by doing, it provides a particular type of
knowledge that cannot be acquired easily through
other types of learning (Delmar and Shane 2006). In
this vein, expert information-processing theory suggests that people develop reﬁned and complex cognitive structures (schemata) as they gain experience
in a particular area. These structures may help repeat
founders in processing new information and in unifying disparate sets of information, and also in arriving
at qualitatively more sophisticated judgments (Gagné
and Glaser 1987).
In terms of opportunity identiﬁcation, these arguments suggest that serial founders could have developed speciﬁc insights on the process of opportunity
identiﬁcation and have reﬁned cognitive structures in
place that assist in market opportunity search. Two
recent studies support this assumption. First, Baron
and Ensley (2006) ﬁnd that experienced founders
have acquired richer and more reﬁned cognitive representations of business opportunities than novices
(opportunity prototypes), which helps them pursue
opportunities most likely to yield positive ﬁnancial
outcomes. Whereas novice entrepreneurs emphasize
evaluation criteria such as the novelty of the idea,
the superiority of the product or service, and the
potential to change the industry, repeat entrepreneurs
look for business opportunities that will quickly generate positive cash ﬂow, have a manageable level
of risk, and solve a customer’s problem. Second,
ﬁeld research by McGrath and MacMillan (2000) indicates that experienced founders have developed a
distinct entrepreneurial mindset that provides these
individuals with rich cognitive frameworks for identifying and pursuing business opportunities. They
ﬁnd that entrepreneurs who have repeatedly created
successful new ﬁrms employ so-called “opportunity
registers;” i.e., they identify and keep track of multiple business opportunities before they decide which
one is the best to pursue. Although McGrath and
MacMillan’s observations concern business opportunities as such, the underlying logic may also apply
in the context of market opportunities for technologies: Serial entrepreneurs seek out a larger number of market opportunities prior to ﬁrst entry, so
that they have a larger choice set at hand before
deciding which market opportunity to pursue with
their emerging technology ﬁrms.2 As indicated above,
2
As an illustration of the multiple market opportunities that can
arise from a technological resource, consider the example of a
young European plastic manufacturer. This ﬁrm developed a new
form of plastic that remains water resistant while in use, but can be
dissolved when a reagent is added to the water. It identiﬁed multiple markets for its innovative plastic, with applications ranging
from diapers to humidity sensors to agricultural ﬁlms (Jolly 1997).

1655

serial entrepreneurs may not only possess superior
abilities in market opportunity identiﬁcation, but may
also have a higher awareness of the importance of
market conditions for successful new ﬁrm creation
and thus may be more willing to search for markets.
Hypothesis 1 (H1). Founding teams that have members with prior entrepreneurial experience will consider a
larger number of market opportunities prior to ﬁrst market
entry than teams without such experience.
3.2.

Preentry Market Opportunity Search and
Postentry Performance
Given the uncertainties associated with market opportunity identiﬁcation and evaluation, the ﬂeeting
nature of some opportunities, and a variety of other
factors that impact search and ﬁrm creation processes,
it is unclear whether performance beneﬁts can be
derived from the identiﬁcation of multiple opportunities. Several theoretical arguments suggest that
the identiﬁcation of multiple market opportunities is
an important precursor to achieving superior performance outcomes in new ﬁrm creation.
First, it is one of the premises of classical decisionmaking theory that the availability of alternative solutions will enhance organizational problem-solving
outcomes (Janis and Mann 1977). This notion is
echoed by behavioral decision theorists (March and
Simon 1958) and also in studies on human creativity
suggesting that people who can brainstorm several
solutions to a problem have a higher likelihood of
ﬁnding the most promising solution (Osborn 1957).
Second, market characteristics are of great importance in entrepreneurship because they have a considerable impact on the rent-earning potential of ﬁrm
resources (Peteraf and Bergen 2003). Market opportunities usually vary along key dimensions such as
market size, lifecycle stage, demand uncertainty, entry
barriers, and competitive rivalry. For example, the
eight markets discussed in Shane (2000) had projected market sizes that ranged between 10 million
and several billion USD. Thus, moving beyond the
local solution by increasing the search space can lead
to highly novel recombinations of knowledge, potentially more valuable opportunities, and a greater set
of opportunities from which to choose. Research on
established ﬁrms supports this reasoning by suggesting that whereas local search can lead to the identiﬁcation of local performance optima, above-average
ﬁrm performance relies more heavily on a ﬁrm’s ability to identify a global optimum through a distant
search (e.g., Rosenkopf and Nerkar 2001).
Third, the market choice deﬁnes a core element of a
new ﬁrm and has a strong imprinting effect, because
it forms the basis for other key strategic decisions
such as the conﬁguration of the internal and external value chain (Abell 1980, Geroski 1998, Danneels

<-----Page 5----->Downloaded from informs.org by [155.247.166.234] on 19 May 2015, at 00:07 . For personal use only, all rights reserved.

1656

Gruber, MacMillan, and Thompson: Market Opportunity Identiﬁcation in Emerging Technology Firms

2003). New ﬁrms can get stuck with their initial (inferior) choice, because they may not be in a position to
afford the adjustment costs incurred by changing the
target market.
Fourth, although the exploitation of more distant
market opportunities requires an adequate knowledge base and access to appropriate core and complementary resources, some managerial practices can
support entrepreneurs in pursuing distant conﬁgurations. For example, they may acquire distant knowledge by hiring new team members, or by creating
alliances (Roy 2005).
Against this backdrop, we argue that it is important for successful ﬁrm creation that technology
entrepreneurs have a choice of target markets prior
to ﬁrst entry. We thus postulate the following
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2A (H2A). Technology start-ups that
consider more than one market opportunity for a technological competence prior to the ﬁrst market entry will
be more successful than those that consider just a single
market opportunity.
Extending further, the question arises whether
founders who search for ever-more market opportunities can expect to beneﬁt from constructing a
larger choice set of such opportunities prior to ﬁrst
entry. To construct a larger choice set, founders need
to broaden the scope of their search and explore
more distant regions of the search landscape (March
1991). As discussed, distant searches allow a combination of existing knowledge with new, far-ﬂung
knowledge elements. Although research indicates that
the integration of distant knowledge elements may
not necessarily lead to a viable combination, it also
suggests that combinations involving distant knowledge can lead to highly valuable and potentially
path-breaking solutions (Fleming and Sorenson 2004,
Nerkar and Roberts 2004). Thus, chances are that
founders may indeed identify highly attractive market domains when they explore more distant regions
of the market search landscape.
However, the construction of a larger choice set
is also associated with additional search costs and
mounting challenges in opportunity evaluation and
exploitation. Speciﬁcally, founders will need to devote
increasing amounts of monetary resources, time, and
energy to extend their exploration of the market
landscape (March 1991, Gavetti and Levinthal 2000).3
Thus, when entrepreneurs extend their market opportunity search they may be able to do so with only few
3
Note that some of the costs mentioned in the following discussion
could be of differential importance for novice and for experienced
entrepreneurs. For example, the latter may have a social network in
place that can provide different kinds of resources and capabilities
for new ﬁrm creation.

Management Science 54(9), pp. 1652–1665, © 2008 INFORMS

resources and may thus fail to identify major opportunities. Those who engage in an extended search
may also have fewer resources available for opportunity exploitation (Gifford 1992, 1998), and may
face an important opportunity cost, or cost of delay
(Radner 1996), since the opportunities identiﬁed early
on could be of a ﬂeeting nature.
Further, decision processes will become more arduous and costly, and the limited information-processing capacity of entrepreneurs will be increasingly
strained when more information has to be collected
and more market alternatives have to be evaluated
(Simon 1982). In this vein, research on cognitive
abilities indicates that the most complex set of interrelationships an individual can process in working
memory is a three-way interaction (Halford et al.
1994). Thus, beyond some number of market opportunities in a choice set, founders may become overwhelmed by the complexity of the evaluation task
and may not be able to evaluate the causal relationships between potential alternative actions and possible outcomes (Radner 1996).4 In the extreme, they
may even become dysfunctional as they suffer from
cognitive distress or paralysis by analysis (Peters and
Waterman 1982).
It can also be expected that the costs of exploiting more distant market opportunities are higher than
for closely related opportunities. The more distant
the identiﬁed market opportunities are, the higher
the costs of acquiring and integrating the knowledge
required to exploit them will be (Katila and Ahuja
2002). Similarly, acquiring or developing the required
resources may be too costly or may take too long to
be practical (Dierickx and Cool 1989).
In sum, these arguments suggest that although an
extended search for market opportunities can lead
to a larger choice set with potentially more valuable options, there are also important costs and major
challenges associated with a more extensive search
and evaluation process. Given the uncertainty of an
extended search and these costs and challenges, we
believe that, overall, there are decreasing marginal
returns in constructing a larger choice set.5 It should
be emphasized, however, that the speciﬁc nature of
4
In this vein, the uncertainty associated with more distant opportunities may make it difﬁcult, or even impossible, to arrive at proper
evaluations (Knight 1921).
5
There could also be economies of scale in opportunity search
activities. For example, entrepreneurs engaging in a more extensive search may purchase third-party databases to acquire information on potential application areas. Because of the possibility
of increased search efﬁciency with such inputs, a decrease in the
average cost of identifying additional market opportunities may
be observed. However, following the arguments presented above,
we believe that there are increasing challenges and costs associated
with performing a distant search for market opportunities.

considering more than one market opportunity is subject

Research Design

4.1. Sample
To examine the research questions outlined previously,
we required data on the founding team, preentry market opportunity identiﬁcation, ﬁrm performance, and
other organizational characteristics. No public data set
offers such information, so we collected data through a
self-administered survey of new ﬁrms backed by venture capital. With this sample of new ﬁrms, we could
be conﬁdent that we were studying performanceoriented new ﬁrms with high growth aspirations.
Data for this study comes from two sources:
(1) a questionnaire addressed to founders of VCbacked companies in Germany, and (2) a separate
data set containing performance data on a subset
of the surveyed ﬁrms. Survey data were collected
in the summer of 2003 using a standardized Webbased questionnaire. Access to the sample of 348
VC-backed ﬁrms was provided through collaboration with a professional services ﬁrm specializing
in Web-based solutions for the VC industry. Following a comprehensive pilot study that included interviews with more than two dozen entrepreneurs, we
developed the survey instrument and pretested it
with 10 entrepreneurs, 4 venture capitalists, and 9
academics. Prior research considers founders highly
knowledgeable and valid information sources, so we
addressed the questionnaires directly to the ﬁrms’
founders, following a key-informant approach (Huber
and Power 1985, Glick et al. 1990). The questionnaire
was online for 12 weeks. A telephone follow-up was
conducted after Week 6. We received questionnaires
from 142 VC-backed ﬁrms, yielding a response rate
of 40.8%. Respondent ﬁrms had a median founding
year of 1999. We conducted an analysis for nonresponse bias by comparing early and late respondents,
with the latter serving as a proxy group for nonresponding ﬁrms (Armstrong and Overton 1977). No
indication of nonresponse bias was found.
We merged the survey data set with a second data
set obtained from our collaboration partner and containing information on ﬁrm performance. Speciﬁcally,
this data set provided monthly revenue data, which
we totaled to obtain the yearly revenue ﬁgures used
in our analysis. However, because not all ventures
obtained venture capital prior to their initial market entry (see statistics provided further below) and
because some VC-backed ventures joined the reporting platform of the collaboration partner only after

1657

they had performed their market entry, the second
data set provided revenue data for the ﬁrst and second year after market entry only on a subset of ventures represented in the ﬁrst data set. The merged
data set contained full observations from a total of 83
VC-backed ventures. We analyzed whether any bias
was introduced because of the reduced sample size
by comparing ﬁrms in our merged data set with ﬁrms
that were not part of the merged data set. No indication of such a bias was found.
4.2.

Deﬁnition and Measurement of Variables

4.2.1. Dependent Variables (Market Opportunity Count Models/Performance Models). Number
of Alternative Market Opportunities. This variable records the number of alternative market opportunities
entrepreneurs considered for their technological competence prior to the ﬁrst market entry. In a multistage question, respondents were asked to indicate
whether, prior to ﬁrst market entry, they had considered commercializing their technological resources
(respectively, competences or know-how) in market domains completely different from the market
entered. Respondents who had indicated that they
had considered alternative markets were then asked
to report the number of alternatives considered.
Sales Revenues. Annual sales revenues (in euros)
achieved by the new venture in Year 1 and in Year 2
after the initial market entry were used as dependent
variables. Following Fox (1991), we utilized logarithmic transformations (natural logarithms) for the positively skewed sales variables.6
4.2.2. Covariates. Prior Entrepreneurial Experience.
Respondents reported the number of members of
the founding team who had previously started a
new ﬁrm. We created a dummy variable to capture
whether the founding team possessed prior entrepreneurial experience (1) or not (0).
Management Experience/ Technological Experience/Marketing Experience. Following Wiersema and Bantel
(1992, p. 95), we used the average level of a given trait
in a team to represent the group’s overall characterization. Respondents rated the levels of management
experience, technological experience, and marketing
experience that the team possessed (on a ﬁve-point
Likert-type scale, “very low” to “very high”).
6
There is no consensus as to what constitutes entrepreneurial
success (Delmar and Shane 2006). Entrepreneurs have differing
objectives for starting new ﬁrms (e.g., “lifestyle ventures” versus
“gazelles”), and objectives also vary in importance at different
stages of ﬁrm creation. Our study analyzes a sample of VC-backed
ventures, i.e., new ﬁrms that are highly growth oriented. The
achievement of sales revenues once a new ﬁrm has entered the
market is important, because it shows ﬁnanciers and other stakeholders that a ﬁrm’s vision of the market is real (“proof of market”)
and that it can deliver on its vision.

Gruber, MacMillan, and Thompson: Market Opportunity Identiﬁcation in Emerging Technology Firms

Total Time Spent on Planning and Organizing the Venture. Searching for additional opportunities involves
both direct and indirect opportunity costs. We thus
controlled for the total time spent on planning and
organizing the new ﬁrm. The measurement of planning duration utilized in this study follows prior
studies (Brüderl et al. 1996) and is similar to measures in strategy research (Brews and Hunt 1999). We
measured how many months it took from the start of
active preparation of the new ﬁrm to its market entry.
VC Seed Funding Prior to Market Entry. Extant
research suggests that the availability of resources
will inﬂuence founding team behavior (e.g., Helfat
and Lieberman 2002). Access to ﬁnancial resources
will likely impact market opportunity search, because
entrepreneurs with a resource buffer should be less
pressed for a speedy market entry and can spend
more on search activities and on reconﬁguring their
knowledge/resource base to perform long jumps on
the search landscape. Although all ﬁrms in our sample were backed by venture capital, not all of them
obtained it during the seed stage prior to market
entry. A dummy thus indicates whether the emerging
ﬁrm acquired seed funding (1) or not (0).
Total Costs in Year 1/Year 2. The total costs incurred
by the new ﬁrm in the ﬁrst and in the second year
after market entry are used as controls in the ﬁrstand second-year performance regressions, respectively. Cost data were obtained from the database of
the collaboration partner.
Breadth of Market Entry. New ﬁrms vary in the
breadth of their product offerings when entering markets, so we created a dummy variable that indicates
whether the new ﬁrm entered with multiple products (0) or with a single product (1).
Founding Team Size. Because team size is an important indicator of the human capital available in a new
ﬁrm, market opportunity search may be inﬂuenced by
founding team size. Following Wiersema and Bantel
(1992), we used a count of the individuals in the initial team (prior to ﬁrst entry).
We also used several controls pertaining to the technologies employed by the emerging ﬁrms:
Technological Fields. The resource requirements to
develop new technologies and other factors vary
across technological ﬁelds. To parcel out such variation, we included dummies to control for the technological ﬁelds represented in our study: Multimedia
and Communication (11% of the sample), Internet (12%), Electronics (6%), Process Engineering
(13%), Software (19%), New Materials (5%), Measuring/Regulation Technology and Handling Systems
(20%), and Others (14%).
Generality of Technology. Whereas the dummies for
technological ﬁelds are “catch-all” measures to control
for variations across technologies, we also employed

Management Science 54(9), pp. 1652–1665, © 2008 INFORMS

a more speciﬁc measure to parcel out the generality
of employed technological competences in our market opportunity count models. The ex ante determination of the generality of an emerging technological
competence is, however, not only a major theoretical
problem (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995, cf. §2.1),
but also poses a difﬁcult empirical challenge. We took
advantage of the information contained in our data
set and utilized the full number of observations on
market opportunity identiﬁcation (n = 133) to denote
technological ﬁelds in which entrepreneurs identify
additional market opportunities more frequently. The
derived index captures the share of new ﬁrms in
a particular technological ﬁeld that considered more
than one market opportunity.7
Self-Developed Technology Licensed-In Technology.
Using a ﬁve-point Likert-type scale, respondents
reported the degree to which the technology they
sought to commercialize had been licensed in (1) or
developed internally (5).
4.3. Methods
We used two statistical methods to test our
hypotheses. Our ﬁrst dependent variable—number of
alternative market opportunities—takes on only nonnegative integer values and consists of zeros and ones
to a signiﬁcant degree. An ordinary linear regression
is not applicable in this context, because it relies on
the normality of the dependent variable (Wooldridge
2002, Greene 2003). Poisson regression can be used
to model count variables, but the negative binomial
regression model is preferred when the assumption
of the equality of the conditional mean and variance
functions is violated (Greene 2003). Because a likelihood ratio test indicated overdispersion, we used
the negative binomial model, which generalizes the
Poisson model by introducing an individual unobserved disturbance term that allows the mean and
variance to vary (Hausman et al. 1984). The negative
binomial model (cf. Greene 2003) takes the following
form: ln i = xi + 	i (i equals the mean and variance of yi , xi is the vector of regressors, and exp	
is the gamma-distributed error term). For our second
set of dependent variables, sales revenues in Year 1
and Year 2 after market entry, we employ an ordinary
least-squares estimator (Wooldridge 2002).
Recent publications (Hamilton and Nickerson 2003)
suggest that endogeneity might pose a problem in
empirical management research, because managers
(entrepreneurs) make decisions based on expectations

checks, we ﬁnd that results are consistent when employing this
measure in lieu of the technological ﬁeld dummies.

5.1. Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix
are reported in Table 1. Correlations are relatively low,
indicating that collinearity should not be a concern.
We see that 28% of the ﬁrms considered more than one
market opportunity prior to ﬁrst entry. This evidence
provides an important extension to Shane’s (2000)
qualitative study of the eight MIT entrepreneurs, each
of whom identiﬁed just one market opportunity prior
to entry. Notably, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms with multiple
market opportunities can be found in all technological ﬁelds represented in our study (see values in
Footnote 7). Figure 1 depicts the number of additional market opportunities that had been considered
prior to ﬁrst entry. In the subsample of new ﬁrms
that considered multiple markets, the majority considered three additional markets (subsample mean =
368; median = 3). A separate calculation shows that
ﬁrms that considered multiple opportunities achieved
median revenues in the ﬁrst and second year after

of how their choice impacts future ﬁrm performance.
In particular, self-selection on unobservable or hardto-measure factors may simultaneously inﬂuence market search and performance. To address potential
problems arising from endogeneity in the market
opportunity count models, we followed Heckman’s
(1979) method to correct for self-selection, because
2SLS and 3SLS models are not applicable in the
context of negative binomial regressions (Wooldridge
2002). We ﬁrst estimated a reduced-form probit model
capturing the decision to consider additional market
opportunities. Second, we estimated market opportunity counts as a function of identiﬁed variables and
corrected for possible self-selection bias by including
the inverse Mills ratio, i.e., an index that was generated from the probit estimates. To address potential
problems arising from endogeneity in the performance models, we performed instrumental variables
regression (by ﬁrst predicting the number of alternative market opportunities with a set of exogenous
variables in a negative binomial model, then utilizing the predicted number in our performance models);
we report these results in Table 3 (Models 4 and 8).
Moreover, we include a lagged dependent variable
in the second-year models (Models 5–7), because the
inclusion of this variable offers a straightforward way
to correct for potential biases from unobserved factors that codetermine market search and performance
(Wooldridge 2002, p. 300; Hamilton and Nickerson
2003). We will thus be able to obtain accurate estimations of the ceteris paribus effect of market opportunity identiﬁcation.

5.2. Market Opportunity Count Models
Results of the negative binomial regression are presented in Table 2. Model 1 estimates a baseline model
of controls, Model 2 adds the predictor variable prior
entrepreneurial experience, and Models 3 and 4 estimate interaction effects of team variables. The predictor variable and the interactions signiﬁcantly increase
the explanatory power of Models 2–4, as measured by
twice the difference in the respective log-likelihoods
and compared to a chi-square statistic with degrees
of freedom equal to the number of newly added variables. Note that we utilize conservative two-sided
tests of signiﬁcance in Table 2.
Hypothesis 1 predicted that founding teams with
prior entrepreneurial experience would identify a
larger number of market opportunities than teams
lacking this experience. We ﬁnd support for this
hypothesis in Model 2 of Table 2. Whereas the effects
of prior entrepreneurial experience and management
experience are positive, technological experience
and marketing experience have a negative association. Additional support for Hypothesis 1 is provided in Models 3 and 4, which offer a more
detailed examination of the knowledge available in
founding teams by including interaction terms. We
see that prior entrepreneurial experience positively
moderates the relationships between marketing experience and market opportunity identiﬁcation, and
between technological experience and market opportunity identiﬁcation. Because interaction effects do not
lend themselves to easy interpretation in nonlinear
estimation models, we provide a pictorial representation of these interactions in Figures 2a and 2b. Both
graphs show that teams with prior entrepreneurial
experience consider a larger number of market opportunities prior to ﬁrst market entry. Notably, these

effects do not show up in interactions with management experience (Model 5).
5.3. Performance Models
To test the performance hypotheses, we have estimated two sets of regression models (Table 3). The
ﬁrst set of estimations (Models 1–4) gives results
for performance in the ﬁrst year after market entry.
Model 1 reports the baseline model in which a number of control variables, including the technology ﬁeld
dummies, were introduced. In Model 2 we introduce the dummy variable capturing the consideration
of alternative market opportunities prior to the ﬁrst
entry. In Model 3 we substitute the dummy variable
for the number of market opportunities considered
in order to assess the functional form of the relationship between market opportunity identiﬁcation
and new ﬁrm performance. In Model 4 we substitute
the variable number of market opportunities considered
with an instrumental variable derived in a two-stage
estimation procedure (see above). The second set of

estimations (Models 5–8) replicates this setup using
second-year performance as the dependent variable.
Again, we use two-sided tests of signiﬁcance.
In H2A we propose that the consideration of more
than one market opportunity prior to ﬁrst entry has a
beneﬁcial effect on new ﬁrm performance. Even after
controlling for differences across technological ﬁelds
using the technological ﬁeld dummies, the estimates
provided in Model 2 reveal that the coefﬁcient of
the dummy variable more than one market opportunity
is positive and signiﬁcant. Hence, we claim support for H2A. New ﬁrms that considered more than
one market opportunity prior to ﬁrst entry generated
signiﬁcantly higher revenues early on, which is an
important achievement in ﬁrm creation.
Hypothesis 2B proposes that the performance beneﬁts of considering multiple market opportunities
are subject to decreasing marginal returns. We tested
this hypothesis by substituting the dummy variable

1661

in Model 2 with the continuous variable number
of alternative market opportunities (logarithmic form)
in Model 3 and the predicted continuous variable
(instrument) in Model 4. The positive and signiﬁcant
coefﬁcients of both variables suggest support for H2B,
with point estimates from the regression estimation
conﬁrming a positive yet decreasing relationship with
performance (we did not ﬁnd evidence of an invertedU-shaped relationship).
Models 5–8 in Table 3 give results for ﬁrm performance in the second year after market entry. As mentioned, a lagged dependent variable (performance in
the ﬁrst year) was included to account for unobserved
factors (Wooldridge 2002). Although effect sizes are
somewhat smaller, Models 6–8 mirror the ﬁndings
from the ﬁrst set of regressions, and thus provide
additional support for H2A and H2B. Again, the effect
of identifying an increasing number of markets is
nonlinear; point estimates from the regression equation conﬁrm a positive, yet decreasing, relationship
with performance.
Among the controls, we conﬁrm earlier studies on
entrepreneurial teams by ﬁnding a signiﬁcant positive relationship between the number of founders and
ﬁrm performance (e.g., Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven
1990). We do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of prior
entrepreneurial experience; this result is in line with
earlier studies showing insigniﬁcant effects (e.g.,
Westhead and Wright 1998).
5.4. Robustness Tests
We performed several additional analyses to test
the robustness of our results. First, we utilized the
full sample to analyze the robustness of our market
opportunity count models. Results are consistent with
those of the restricted sample. Second, we performed
a probit estimation utilizing the dummy analyzed additional markets or not as a dependent measure. Results
are consistent with the negative binomial regressions
of market opportunity counts, in both the restricted
and full samples. Third, to analyze the robustness of
our performance models we utilized the combined
sales performance in the ﬁrst and second year after
market entry as the dependent variable. The analysis produced results (see Model 9 in Table 3) that
are consistent with those discussed earlier. Fourth,
although proﬁts in the ﬁrst and second year after market entry are a highly debatable measure of the early
performance of strongly growth-oriented ventures,
we nonetheless ran our analysis with this dependent
variable. We did not ﬁnd that the identiﬁcation of a
single market opportunity, or multiple ones, is significantly related to early proﬁt outcomes, nor were any
of the other substantive variables. Given the characteristics of VC-backed ventures, we believe that profits could be a meaningful early performance measure

Discussion

We have argued that the market choice is a profound
organizational decision in emerging ﬁrms. Against
a background of sparse prior research, this study
has produced several interesting results that have
novel implications for the organizational, strategy,
and entrepreneurship literatures, and for practice.
6.1. Theoretical Implications
Opportunity identiﬁcation and exploitation are seen
as the core of the entrepreneurial process (Shane and

Venkataraman 2000). Although opportunity identiﬁcation plays a major role in conceptualizations of ﬁrm
creation, the notion of multiple opportunity identiﬁcation prior to entry has yet to be acknowledged
in the research literature. By showing that multiple
market opportunity identiﬁcation matters, this study
suggests that the literature needs to better reﬂect the
difference between identifying a single opportunity
or multiple ones and the related idea of choosing the
most favorable market conditions for new ﬁrm creation (a notion that evolutionary biologists commonly
refer to as “habitat selection”).
Because there are multiple demands placed on the
limited attention of entrepreneurs, the identiﬁcation
of market opportunities requires that entrepreneurs

allocate time and attention away from other, perhaps
more routine, activities to search the market opportunity landscape and gather new information (Radner
1996, Gifford 1998). This allocation of attention comes
at an opportunity cost, or cost of delay, in that less
time and energy, or none at all, is available to exploit
the ﬁrst identiﬁed opportunity. However, there is also
an opportunity cost, and as our ﬁndings suggest an
important one, in not seeking to identify additional
markets. Thus, researchers may want to develop a
more nuanced understanding of a “speeding products
to market” approach suggested by earlier studies, as
entrepreneurs run the risk of rushing products to inferior markets when they neglect to explore alternative
options.
The ﬁndings also add to our knowledge on the
effects of prior entrepreneurial experience, because
it is not only experience in establishing a new ﬁrm
but also in opportunity identiﬁcation that has a key
impact on new ﬁrm performance. Our results provide an important complement to recent research by
Baron and Ensley (2006) that indicates that serial and
novice entrepreneurs apply different criteria when
assessing a business opportunity. We add to this toplevel picture by revealing that serial entrepreneurs
also identify a larger number of market opportunities than novices do, and thus are in a position to
choose the most promising market. This view also
extends McGrath and MacMillan’s (2000) characterization of the entrepreneurial mindset exhibited by
serial entrepreneurs.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd that teams possessing a
mix of prior entrepreneurial experience and experience in technology (or marketing) identify a larger
number of opportunities than teams with technology (or marketing) experience only.8 Although we
do not observe information ﬂows within teams, the
uncovered pattern indicates that serial entrepreneurs
inﬂuence the market search behavior of other team
members. Whereas recent research suggests that it
“is not the selection of people that determines the
degree of exploration, but what they are asked to do”
(Taylor and Greve 2006, p. 736), the present ﬁndings
8
Whereas these effects are not addressed in the present paper, we
will provide a brief discussion of this pattern. We ﬁnd that technological experience is negatively related to market search. Following
prior research in entrepreneurship and innovation (cf. Dougherty
1992), it seems that a primary reason for this ﬁnding is that people in technology tend to show less appreciation for market-related
topics. There may also be multiple reasons for the negative effect of
marketing experience, but it seems likely that individuals with such
a background are well trained to craft and execute sophisticated
marketing plans, and less so in the earlier stage of market opportunity identiﬁcation. A thorough analysis of how human and social
capital endowments shape market opportunity identiﬁcation in
technology ﬁrms can be found in our companion paper (Gruber
et al. 2007, 2008).

thus indicate that both aspects matter for exploration:
selecting people with the requisite level of knowledge (e.g., high levels of technological experience)
and engaging them in an exploratory search.
Along these lines, our study has additional implications for the search literature. First, most studies
in this area focus on technology search (Fleming and
Sorenson 2004). We add to this body of work by
investigating search efforts for market opportunities
for technological resources. Second, prior studies have
devoted only scant attention to the key aspect of
alternative generation (Knudsen and Levinthal 2007).
Our study provides evidence of alternative generation regarding a major organizational decision, and
shows the empirical relationship between the number
of alternatives generated and performance. Finally,
evidence on the value of path-creating search has
been an important desideratum. As the beginnings
of paths are more clearly visible in new ﬁrms, our
research setting provides a vantage point from which
to observe path creation. The results suggest a nonlinear value of path-creating market search.
6.2. Implications for Practice
Most generally, our ﬁndings indicate that technology entrepreneurs should “look before they leap.”
Although market search activities involve some challenges and costs, the consequences of not identifying
a market that offers more favorable founding conditions can be profound. It is thus unfortunate that
current business-planning handbooks typically fail
to offer guidelines on opportunity identiﬁcation and
selection, because they assume that an opportunity
has been identiﬁed. We are aware of only two books
in this area that address the issue of opportunity identiﬁcation and selection (Mullins 2003, McKnight 2004).
As for investors, VCs may suffer from biases in evaluating new ﬁrm proposals, or may not be able to
detect when such proposals suffer from entrepreneurs’
perceptual biases. Insofar as biases prevent the consideration of alternative market opportunities, we suggest that investors should emphasize an evaluation of
technological cross-application opportunities in their
due diligence.
6.3. Limitations
In interpreting the results of this study, certain limitations must be kept in mind. First, our analysis is
based on a sample of VC-backed ﬁrms, an elite category. On the one hand, this sample has advantages for
a study of market opportunity search, because these
ﬁrms are begun with high professionalism. Because
just 28% of ﬁrms in this sample considered more than
one market opportunity, we believe that this fraction
would have been smaller in samples of more conventional new ﬁrms, thus making it more difﬁcult to

<-----Page 13----->Downloaded from informs.org by [155.247.166.234] on 19 May 2015, at 00:07 . For personal use only, all rights reserved.

examine the phenomenon. On the other hand, our
results could be biased toward a speciﬁc type of new
ﬁrm. Second, our study faced common challenges
associated with measuring the generality of technological competences. Whereas prior research stresses
resource fungibility (Penrose 1959, Jolly 1997), some
technological competences may be more easily adaptable to additional markets than others. In an attempt
to parcel out this type of variation, we employed three
different kinds of control variables for the emerging technologies, and also controlled for the availability of ﬁnancial resources. Although we consider this
approach to be a viable if imperfect solution to a very
complex problem, we also sought to increase conﬁdence in our results by using instrumental variables
regression and by employing a lagged dependent
variable. The results offered consistent support for
our hypotheses. Third, data from privately held technology ventures—and, in particular, from VC-backed
ventures—is hard to obtain. In the light of our empirical results it seems that such a sample of highly professional ventures is required to address the research
questions examined in our study. However, we also
note that the sample used for the empirical analyses is
relatively small. Fourth, our study is based on performance data covering the ﬁrst two years after market
entry, which is a particularly critical period in the life
of new ﬁrms. Although we cannot rule out that new
ﬁrms that underperformed in the ﬁrst two years may
become outperformers at some later point, we believe
that early-stage performance is a major achievement
in new ﬁrm creation. For example, early-stage performance will signal to investors, potential customers,
and other stakeholders that the new ﬁrm is on a solid
track to become an established entity. Nonetheless,
future research needs to explore longer term performance. Further, given the discussion about appropriate measures of new ﬁrm performance, we note that
this study used data on sales revenues as a performance measure. Although the achievement of substantial sales revenues is an important performance
outcome for VC-backed technology ﬁrms, future studies should also investigate the relationship between
market search and other success measures.
6.4. Further Research and Conclusion
The ﬁndings from this study suggest several interesting opportunities for future research. Because our
results indicate that repeat entrepreneurs possess special insights on technology-market linking, we suggest that future studies should develop a better understanding as to why repeat entrepreneurs have learned
to identify multiple market opportunities prior to
deciding which market to enter. For example, we
believe that repeat entrepreneurs have learned not
only that market conditions are of high importance,

Management Science 54(9), pp. 1652–1665, © 2008 INFORMS

but also that technological fungibility opens up opportunities for resource leveraging. Along these lines,
researchers may also want to study the capability
needed to perform an effective market opportunity
search. As our companion study suggests, the knowledge repertoire of the founding team and its social
network seem to play a major role in the development of this capability (Gruber et al. 2007, 2008). Given
the broader importance of market opportunity identiﬁcation for ﬁrm emergence, ﬁrm evolution, and the
exploitation of the value inherent in resources, we
believe that further studies investigating the nuances
of the market search activity are crucial to understanding entrepreneurship, resource leveraging, decisions on organizational scope, growth, and related
phenomena.
