* The investmentof venturecapitalfundsin growingenterprises is a remarkablefeat of financialengineering.Investors
in privateventurecapital funds place their money for long
periodsof time in thehandsof venturecapitalistsof uncertain
ability and who have committedonly small amountsof their
own funds. The venturecapitalistsseek out promisingventures, eventually placing money in risky venturesmanaged
by entrepreneurswhose skills areunknownandwhose future
efforts are not predictable.Such investmentsare often made
in firms that have not yet registered one single dollar of
revenues;have no productsin existence at the time of investment, only unprovenand untestedideas; and do not have a
complete,experiencedmanagementteam.The entrepreneurs
have informationnot possessed by the venture capitalists.
The venture capitalists not only commit money to these
entrepreneurs,but they also commit weeks of their time
assisting them. Despite the extensive monitoring,more than
one-third of the investments made by venture capitalists
result in losses, and a sizable fractionresults in loss of the
entire original investment,often after years of waiting and
aftercountless hoursof handholdingby the venturecapitalists. Venturecapitalis an areaof finance in which issues we
encounterto a lesser degree in publiccompaniescan take on
extremeimportance.
The authoris gratefulto Stan Block, PaulGompers,ChrisMuscarella,Rick

And yet venture capital survives. Hellman (1993)
estimates that $2.5 billion of venture capital investments
were made in 1992 from a pool of $33 billion in capital
committedto the venturecapitalindustry.In the first half of
1994, $1.7 billion of new capitalwas committedto private
venturecapital funds (Private EquityAnalyst (1994)). The
mere fact that venturecapital exists bears testimony to the
adaptability of financial systems. Because problems
encounteredin venturecapitalinvesting are so challenging,
the uncertaintyso high, the asymmetriesof informationso
great, and the opportunitiesso outstanding,venturecapital
finance gives us an opportunityto study modem financial
theoryin a settingof extremes.In such a setting,some of the
issues often assumedaway in othercircumstancescannotbe
ignored.Thus, we have the opportunityand the necessity in
venture capital to learn more about risk, uncertainty,and
contractingtechnology.
In spite of the intriguingissues in venturecapitalfinance,
relativelylittle has been publishedon this subjectin the most
influentialfinancejournals.Why?Probablyfor two reasons.
First, the theoreticalproblems are complex, many-faceted,
and difficult to solve. Second, the very natureof venture
capitalcreatesdifficulties for the empiricistbecausedataon
privateinvestmentby privatefirms arenot easily obtained.
Nevertheless,significantprogresshas been maderecently
toward understanding the problems of venture capital
finance. New theories have been formulated and new
databaseshavebeen tappedordeveloped,sheddingnew light
on issues aboutwhich we knew very little as recentlyas the
1980s. The door has been opened, andopportunitiesabound
for new work on venturecapitalfinance.

The purposeof this paperis to providea selective survey
and synthesis of recent findings in venturecapital research
andto puttheminto perspective,suggestingnew avenuesfor
study.The goal of the paperis not to surveyexhaustivelyall
published work on venture capital finance. Two recent
papers, taken together, provide a more comprehensive
overview of the field. One is Sahlman's (1990) paper that
explains venture capital and its organizationalsetting. A
second is Norton's (1993) surveypaper,which takes a more
managerialorientationthandoes Sahlman'spaper.The two
paperscontain 147 referenceson venturecapital.In addition
to those papers, Gompers (1994b) provides an updated
history and an interesting analysis of the venture capital
industry.
The presentpaperbegins with an introductionto venture
capital in the first section. The second section discusses
recent findings and current controversies in a variety of
topics on venturecapitalfinance.The thirdsection points to
unanswered questions and offers suggestions for further
research.

pension funds, endowments,and insurancecompanies.The
limited partners rely on the general partners to make
investment decisions and to monitor the resulting
investmentson theirbehalf. The partnershiphas a finite life
(usually ten years), and the funds must be distributedto the
limitedpartnersby the end of thatperiod(subjectto possible
extensions for up to three years). Thus, the continued
activitiesof the venturecapitalistsdependon creatinga series
of limitedpartnershipsthatcan attractnew investmentfunds.
An important aspect of the relationship between the
generalandlimitedpartnersis the formof compensation.The
commonformof compensationis an annualmanagementfee
based on capitalcommitted,which usuallyamountsto 2.5%
of capital and a portion (typically 20%) of carriedinterest.
Carriedinterestrefersto the investmentgains realizedby the

Venturecapitaliststypicallyscreenhundredsof proposals

specialize, investing in firms at a particular stage of
development2(such as start-upor at productintroduction)or
in particularindustries.By specializing, venturecapitalists
can betterunderstandthe industryin which the firmoperates
and its technology. They may also have contacts with
suppliers,customers,or otherswithtechnicalexpertisein the
industry. Experienced venture capitalists will also have
experiencewiththe processof going public,withthe process
of selling or merginga portfoliofirm,with the liquidationof
unpromising ventures, and with the replacement of
management.That experience is a key resource that the
venturecapitalistbrings to the table in helping to nurturea
developing firm.
Recent research has sought to understand the
relationshipsamongthe limitedpartners,venturecapitalists,
and portfolio companies from both a theoretical and
empiricalpoint of view. I turnnow to some of the important
issues addressedin the literature.

In most Spanish-speakingnations, there is no explicit
term for venture capital; instead, the term "capital de
riesgo," or risk capital, is used. That term captures an
importantdimensionof venturecapital-it is capitalinvested
in highly risky ventures.But thereis moreto venturecapital
than making high-risk investments. Venture capital also
entails an active and motivated working relationship in
which the venturecapitaliststake on importantroles within
their portfolio firms in which they have invested. Venture
capitalists,actingon behalf of thirdparties,actively monitor
the investments and sometimes assume important
managerialroles withinthe firm.Wame (1988) characterizes
venturecapitalas the combinationof capitalandconsulting.
In brief, venturecapitalentailsthe investmentof risk capital

activitiesanddecision-makingprocessof venturecapitalists.
Most have takenthe pointof view thatventurecapitalistsadd
value as financial intermediaries,althougheven that basic
assumptionhas been challengedrecently(see Amit, Glosten,
and Muller (1990)). I begin here by looking at the activities
of venturecapitalistsandthen, againstthatbackground,turn
to the more recent investigations of the issue of whether
venture capital plays a positive or negative role. Finally, I
examine a numberof recent studies that deal with the wide
arrayof agency issues confrontedin a venturecapitalsetting.
A. What Do Venture Capitalists Do?
GormanandSahlman(1989) surveyedventurecapitalists
andaskedhow they spendtheirtime.Theyfoundthatventure
capitalists spend roughly half of their time monitoring an
averageof nine portfoliocompanies.They spend an average
of 110 hoursper year workingwith each portfoliofirm, and
their most frequentactivity is assisting the firm in raising
additional funds. Typical respondents said that they had
replaced three chief executive officers in portfolio
companies during their careers as venture capitalists.This
finding is consistentwith the broadview that key activities
of venturecapitalistsareidentifyingandrecruitingmembers
to the managementteamof portfoliocompanies.Those same
venture capitalists identified weak management as the
dominantcause of failureamong theirportfolio companies,
so it is naturalthat considerableemphasis would be placed
on managementability.
Venturecapitaliststypically specialize by emphasizinga
particular industry, such as biotechnology, or by
emphasizing a particularstage of development, such as
startupcompanies or companies in the expansion stage. A
number of papers describe the specialization of venture
capitalists (see, for example, Gupta and Sapienza (1992),
Norton and Tenenbaum (1993), and Ruhnka and Young
(1991)); some suggest that the specialization of venture
capitalistsmakes it prudentfor the venturecapital investor
to diversify across venture capitalists to eliminate the
diversifiable risk inherent in specialization. Barry,
Muscarella,Peavy, andVetsuypens(BMPV) (1990) provide
a tableshowingthe industryspecializationof venture-backed
IPOs and suggest that specializationaids in the monitoring
process. A numberof papersby Lemer (1994a, 1994b, and
1994c) focus specifically on biotechnology ventures and
provide details of the functioningof venturecapital within
thatindustry.
Other papers have examined the activities of venture
capitalistsin evaluatingnew opportunities.Most notablehas
been the work of Tyebjee and Bruno (TB) (1984), who

5

examined90 deals madeby 41 venturecapitalists.Theypoint
out five principal activities carried out by the venture
capitalists:
1. Deal origination
2. Deal screening
3. Deal evaluation
4. Deal structuring
5. Post-investmentactivities
Recent researchon venturecapital in the finance literature
has focused on steps four and five. A body of literaturealso
exists thatfocuses on steps two and three (for example, see
Roberts (1991) and MacMillan, Zemann, and Subbanarasimha(1987)).
In this issue of FinancialManagement,FriedandHisrich
(1994) present results of field studies and interviews with
venture capitalists to understand their activities better,
specifically their decision to invest. They show that, in the
averageinvestmentmadeby the 18 venturecapitalistsin their
sample,the venturecapitalistsspentthreeweeks of full-time
effort in evaluatingand closing the deal and thatnearly 100
days elapse duringthis process. Fried and Hisrich examine
the investmentdecision-makingprocess in orderto identify
the activities venture capitalists undertake to avoid the
adverse selection problemdescribedby Amit, Glosten, and
Muller (1990). They argue that an intensive screening and
evaluation process allows the venture capitaliststo gather
substantialamountsof informationpriorto investingandthat
this informationreducesthe adverseselection problem.
Lerner (1994b) finds another way in which venture
capitalistsreduce the adverseselection problem:They tend
to syndicatetheirinvestments,i.e., venturecapitaliststendto
invest with otherventurecapitalists.Lerer investigated651
roundsof investmentin 271 biotechnologyfirms. He found
that syndicationis common from the first investmentround
of investing, a fact that he argues is a partof the screening
process:Venturecapitalistsaremorecomfortablewith a deal
when other venture capitalists of similar experience are
willing to invest as well.
The post-investmentactivities of venture capitalistsare
also extensive. BMPV (1990) examinedventurecapitalists'
activities by studying prospectuses of IPOs by
venture-backed firms. They found that the average
venture-backed IPO had three venture capital investors
holding 34% of the pre-IPOequity in the firm. The average
IPO had two venturecapitalistsserving as membersof the
boardof directors,and an averageof 1.8 venturecapitalists
remainedon the boarda full year afterthe IPO. Surprisingly
few venturecapitalistssold any of their shares in the IPO,

<-----Page 4----->6

even thoughparticipatingin the IPO is viewed as a key exit
strategyfor the venturecapitalists.
Lerner (1994a) examined the activities of venture
capitalists in providing oversight of their portfolio
companies. Lerner studied the association between the
venturecapitalists'degree of involvementand the need for
monitoring.In particular,he found that venture capitalist
representationon boardsof directorsincreasedby 44% for
firmsin which the chief executiveofficer (CEO)hadno prior
experience in runningan entrepreneurialfirm. Lerer also
examinedthe impactof a change in CEO. He refersto CEO
replacementas an instanceof" organizationalcrisis" and as
an indication of a need for more intense monitoring. He
found that on average venturecapital investors added 1.75
board members between financing rounds when the CEO
was replaced,versus an averageincreaseof only 0.24 board
members between rounds in which the CEO was not
replaced. Thus, the monitoring activities of venture
capitalistsappearto intensify as the need dictates.
B. How Successful Are Venture Capitalists?
Venture capitalists manage other people's money to
achieve high returns.In orderto do so, they invest in risky
investment opportunities. An important indicator of the
success of venturecapital, therefore,is the realized rate of
return in relation to riskiness of investments in venture
capital funds: Have venture capitalists provided returns
adequateto compensatefor the risk incurred?
Huntsmanand Hoban(1980) examined 110 investments
by three venture capital firms over the period 1960-1975.
They showedthatventurecapitalreturnsdependon outliers.
While the average return over the period was 18.9%,
eliminating the top 10% of investments resulted in an
average returnof -0.28%. In other words, venture capital
success is highly dependenton finding a few outstanding
investments, and diversification is vital. Huntsman and
Hobanprovideno formaltests of the superiorityorinferiority
of theirreturnswith respectto a formalmodel of returns.
Martinand Petty (1983) comparedpublicly tradedfunds
with mutualfunds with a statedgoal of maximumgrowth.
They found that the venture capital funds were riskier on
average (measured by total risk) than their mutual fund
counterpartsbut thatthey were not dominated,i.e., they also
exhibitedhigherreturnson average.Kleimanand Schulman
(1992) providea morerecentanalysisof the performanceof
publicly tradedfunds, examiningsmall business investment
corporations (SBICs) and business development
corporations(BDCs).3 They find that SBICs have higher

FINANCIALMANAGEMENT/ AUTUMN 1994

returnsand higherrisk thanBDCs but thatthe risk of SBICs
is largelyunsystematic.SBICs dominatedBDCs on the basis
of systematic risk in comparison to returns over the
1980-1986 period, although Kleiman and Shulman argue
thatsubsequentcomparisonshave not been so favorable.
Brophy and Gunther(1988) studiedthe performanceof
publicly traded venture capital funds. They constructeda
portfolio of such funds. They found that, although the
individualfundshadhigh totalrisk,theirsystematicriskwas
low, andso a portfolioof suchfundshadlow risk.On a return
versus total risk basis, they found the portfolio of venture
capital funds dominated mutual funds with maximum
growthgoals and the S&P 500 Index.
Chiampou and Kallett (1989) examined 55 private
venturecapital funds, breakingthem into two groups. One
groupconsistedof 35 fundsmorethansix yearsold;the other
groupcontainedthe 20 newer funds. Chiampouand Kallett
foundthatthe investmentreturnsof the 35 maturefundsover
the period 1978-1987 averaged24.4% per annumagainsta
standarddeviation of returnsof 51.2%. The younger firms
performedmuch more poorly, averaging only 5.4% over
theirshorterlives. However,the resultsfor theyoungerfunds
probably reflect two biases in the sample. First, venture
capitalreturnsfor the broadsamplewere lower in the middle
yearsof the 1980s thanin the earlierpartof the sample,and
the newer firms' returns heavily reflected that period.
Second,it is difficultto measurethe valueof relativelyrecent
investments since their values are unlikely to have been
realized throughmergeror public offering or other events.
Their values will often be reflected at cost ratherthan at
marketvalue. The older firms will have more investments
whose values have been markedto market.
Gompers (1994b) presents an analysis of the patternof
returns in the venture capital industry, explaining why
venture returnshave fallen broadly since the early 1980s.
Gompers points out that returns were relatively high,
generally greaterthan 20% on an annualbasis, in the first
half of the 1980s. However, the early success of venture
capital,a hotIPOmarket,andfinancialderegulationattracted
capital in record amounts from pension fund investment
managers.The largerquantityof capitalplaced pressureon
the industryto find deals, and so the valuationof venture
capital deals tended to rise. Also, many relatively
inexperiencedventure capitalists entered the market.The
increaseof institutionalinvestorsin the market,accordingto
Gompers, put pressure on the venture capital funds to
demonstrateearlier the investment results that would be

reflectedin the performanceof the pension fund investment
managers. This pressure tended to cause investment in
relativelylater-stageinvestments,which could be harvested
more quickly but which, involving less risk, would be
expected to producelower averagereturns.
The analysisof venturecapitalperformanceindicatesthat
venture capitalists take on high risks that appear to be
rewardedon average.Those risks tend to be unsystematic,
so that portfolios constructedby investing in a variety of
venture capital funds will have much lower risk than will
investment in a single fund. The evidence regardingthe
performanceof those investmentsis mixed, so it remainsto
be seen whether venture capital is a superior form of
investment.
C. Venture Capital and the Going-public Process
One way to find data on venture capital activities is to
identify IPOs in which venture capitalists have been
investors in the offering firm. For example, using IPO
listings fromVentureEconomics,the majorproviderof data
on the venture capital industry, BMPV developed an
exhaustive set of initial public offerings (IPOs) by
venture-backed companies over the period 1978-1987.
BMPV examined whether the presence of experienced
venturecapitalistson the boardof a firmgoing publicaffects
the resultsof the offering.Evidenceindicatedthatthemarket
recognizedthe qualityof the venturecapitalistsbecauseIPO
underpricingwas lower when the firmhadmoreexperienced
venturecapitalistswho had been investors.
The reputationand certificationrole of venture capital
was also confirmed in a study by Megginson and Weiss
(1991). Theirfindings are consistentwith a recognizedrole
for the venturecapitalistsas monitors.MegginsonandWeiss
used a matched sample of IPOs with venturebacking and
IPOs withoutventurebacking.They found significantlyless
underpricingin those issues with venture capital backing,
which is similarto otherstudies' findings thatthe qualityof
the underwriteror auditorcan influence IPO pricing.
Lin and Smith (1994) developeda series of hypothesesto
describe the role of venture capital in the IPO process.
Because the venturecapitalistis likely to returnto the IPO
market with future offerings of portfolio companies, the
venturecapitalisthas reputationalcapitalto protect,a factor
that may influence whether, when, and at what price the
companywill go public. Lin andSmitharguethatfirmswith
venturecapitalwill be able to come to the marketearlierin
their development,backed by the relationshipwith venture
capital. Gompers (1994a) notes, however, that the venture
capitalistmay in fact choose to bringtheportfoliofirmpublic
earlierthanwould be optimalfor the entrepreneurin orderto

7

attract new investment funds. Gompers calls that
phenomenon"grandstanding."
Lin and Smith go on to arguethatthe venturecapitalist's
IPO selling decision will depend on the venturecapitalist's
reputation,the reputationof the underwriter,and the degree
of underpricing. In particular, high-quality venture
capitalists making offerings via high-quality underwriters
will be morelikely to sell in an underpricedIPO,butunlikely
to sell in cases in which the IPOis overpriced.Lin and Smith
find empiricalsupportfor all of these hypotheses.
Furthermore,the role of monitoringcan change afterthe
IPOdueto thepublicationof informationthatwas previously
private, i.e., informationalasymmetrieswill decrease as a
result of the offering and its accompanying disclosures.
Consistentwith those points,Lin andSmithexpect the value
of monitoringand control to decline, and they hypothesize
that ownership by venture capitalists will also decline
following the offering.(This is an implicationof the Admati
and Pfleiderer(1994) model as well.)
Lerner (1994c) provides evidence that experienced
venture capitalists can time the IPO market.In particular,
Lerner demonstratesthat venture capitalists tend to bring
their portfolio firms public at times when the market
valuation of those firms is particularly high, whereas
privately financed firms tend to go public at times when
marketvaluationsare lower. These results suggest that the
venturecapitalistprovidesa valuableservice in assistingthe
entrepreneurin timing the market.They also suggest that
more experienced venture capitalists have greater ability
and/orgreaterincentivesto time the marketthando theirless
experiencedcounterparts.
Gompers(1994a) shows that relatively less experienced
or less reputableventurecapitalistshave incentivesto bring
a portfolio firm public prematurely.A related paper by
Gifford (1994) investigates the same phenomenonfrom a
theoreticalperspective.
Many studieshave examinedthe role of the entrepreneur
as agentandthe venturecapitalistas principal.Conflictsarise
in such situations because the entrepreneur may have
information unknown to the venture capitalist and may
choose to shirk or overinvest, creating agency costs.
However,we may also see the venturecapitalistas agent for
the entrepreneur.The entrepreneurbrings in the venture
capitalistas a financialpartnerand consultant.The venture
capitalistmay have incentivesto offer badconsultingadvice
to the entrepreneur,i.e., advice that suggests a course of
actioncontraryto the interestsof the entrepreneur,up to and
including the abandonment of an investment that has
economic value (see Sahlman(1990) for a discussion of the
abandonmentdecision). Prematureabandonmentmay come

<-----Page 6----->8

about because the venture capitalist has a diversified
portfolioof opportunitiesanda high opportunitycost of time,
whereas the entrepreneuris fully committedto the venture
and in fact may choose to overinvestotherpeople's money.
Hence, conflicts of interest may arise because of the
incentivesof venturecapitaliststo give advice counterto the
interests of their entrepreneur-partners.
Gompers (1994a)
points out that one such area is in the timing of a public
offering. Instead of abandonment of a viable venture,
however, the venture capitalist encourages a premature
public offering in orderto achieve the visibility associated
with thatofferinganduse thatvisibility in marketingthe next
limitedpartnership.Since the value of the portfolioheld by
the venturecapitalistis not normallyupdatedto its current
market value in the absence of transactions,an IPO may
permit the venture capitalist to mark-to-market an
investmentthatpreviouslywas carriedat a lowerbook value.
This opportunitymay be especially pertinentif the venture
capitalistmarketsnew funds to pension fundmanagerswho
are concerned with reporting their own investment
performance. Gompers suggests that venture capitalists
withouta substantialtrackrecordwould be especially prone
to prematureofferings.
Gompers' empirical results support these hypotheses.
Relatively inexperiencedventure capitalists tend to bring
portfoliocompaniespublicearlierin the life of the firmthan
do establishedventurecapitalists.They also tendto raisenew
funds soonerafteran IPOthando moreexperiencedventure
capitalists. Finally, the IPOs tend to be more underpriced
than are offerings by the more experienced venture
capitalists.This finding also coincides with Lerner'sfinding
concerningthe timing of IPOs:Venturecapitalistswith their
own agendasmay be less concernedaboutthe optimization
of timing viewed from a valuationperspectiveand may be
concernedinsteadwith timing as it affects the marketingof
theirown services.
Gompers' results are disturbingfor anotherreason. In
addition to suggesting that the venture capitalists have
incentives to offer bad advice to their entrepreneursin the
matterof IPO timing, a prematureIPO can also be harmful
to the venture capitalist's investors. That is, Gompers
suggests thatthe interestsof investorsin existing funds may
be compromised by the desire to find investors for an
additionalfund. That situation reflects a potential agency
conflict with existing investorsas well as with entrepreneurs.
D. Contracting Technology between Venture
Capitalists and Entrepreneurs
Sahlman(1990) describesa myriadof agency conflicts in
venturecapital.Sahlmanexplainswhy conflictsexist, andhe

FINANCIALMANAGEMENT/ AUTUMN 1994

explains the mechanismsto deal with such conflicts. There
areconflictsbetweenthe investorsandthe venturecapitalists
as well as conflicts betweenmanagersof portfoliofirmsand
venture capitalists. Sahlman demonstratesthat there is a
similarityin the mechanismsfor addressingsuch conflicts,
and he relates agency costs in a venturecapital context to
agency issues in othersettings.
One feature of contracts between entrepreneursand
venturecapitalistsis that an entrepreneursreceive a payoff
that is typically tied to performancein several ways. First,
entrepreneurswill have an equity interest (perhaps the
dominant equity interest) and will benefit from value
creation.Further,it is commonthatthe degreeof dilutionof
entrepreneurs' ownership interests is tied directly to
performance, so that entrepreneurs(venture capitalists)
receive a larger (smaller) fraction of a more successful
venture. Entrepreneurs commonly receive a relatively
modest salary so that their success is tied to the success of
the venture.It is also commonfor venturecapitaliststo retain
sufficient controlto be able to fire or demote an ineffective
manager.The managerwould typically suffer some loss of
equity interestin such an event in additionto sufferinga loss
in the value of humancapital.
Most of the researchon agency issues in venturecapital
examinescontractingtechnologybetweenentrepreneursand
venture capitalists, taking the narrow perspective of
analyzingagencyconflicts in isolationfromotherrealitiesof
the venturecapital process. Some of the more recent work
has attemptedto take a broaderperspective. For example,
Gompers'(1994a) "grandstanding"analysisrecognizesthat
the relationshipbetween venturecapitalistand entrepreneur
is affectedby the relationshipbetweenthe venturecapitalist
and investors.Nevertheless,most of whatwe know has been
developed from the narrowerperspective.
A conflict arises between venture capitalists and
entrepreneurs because entrepreneurs have information
unavailableto venturecapitalistsand becauseentrepreneurs
makechoices thatarenot fully knownby venturecapitalists.
Forexample,initially,an entrepreneur
knows moreabouthis
or her product than will the venture capitalist. The
entrepreneur may be of unknown quality. Because
entrepreneursare often committed to a single venture and
venturecapitalistshave a portfolio of investmentprojects,
there are potentialconflicts over the amountto invest in a
venture. Using other people's money and having limited
liability, entrepreneursmay want to continueto invest even
aftera projectceases to be viable. Such investmentpreserves
the optionof the entrepreneurson the upsidepotentialof the
project. Entrepreneurs have expectations that are
incompletely known to the venture capitalists and, in the

<-----Page 7----->BARRY/ NEWDIRECTIONS
IN RESEARCHON VENTURECAPITALFINANCE

process of selling the venture, the entrepreneurs may
overstateits likely outcomes.
Venture capitalists can design contractsto lessen these
concerns.Sahlman(1988, 1990) stressesthe use of" staged"
capitalcommitmentas one featureof such contracts,i.e., the
venture capitalist commits only a fraction of the capital
neededfor the ultimatedevelopmentof a project.Subsequent
financing is then tied to the successful completion of
intermediateobjectives.
Staging the capitalcommitmentcreatesan abandonment
option and thereby increases the value of the investment.
Further,an entrepreneur'sdecision to acceptsuch a contract
will provide informationaboutthe entrepreneur'sbeliefs in
his or her own estimatesand in the time and cost requiredto
develop the firststage. Subsequentcapitalcommitmentswill
then benefit from additional information. The venture
capitalistwill be able to reducerisk beforethe second round
of financing, and if all goes well, the entrepreneurmay
benefit froman increasein valuation,leadingto less dilution
of his or her ownership interests in subsequent rounds.
Staged capital commitments also keep the entrepreneur
focused on the task at hand and may motivate a more rapid
pace of activity. Hellman (1993) points out that an
unintended consequence of this focus could be one of
myopia, i.e., the entrepreneurcould lose sight of the big
picture in focusing too narrowly on meeting short-term
goals. A way aroundthat problem is to design short-term
performanceobjectives that are essential as intermediate
steps towardsa longer-termgoal.
Gompers(1993b) furtherdevelops the notion of staging
and shows how it can deal with agency costs and can create
a strategicoption.He pointsout thatthe fractionof intangible
assets affects the level of agency costs and the need for
monitoring.4 Gompers provides empirical evidence on
staging from a databaseof 2,145 rounds of venturecapital
financingfor 795 firms.He finds thatearlystageinvestments
typicallyreceive relativelysmall amountsof capital,thatthe
rate of capitalconsumption(the "burnrate") increasesas a
venture matures,and that greaterindustry sales growth is
associated with capital commitments of longer durations.
Gompersmeasuresthe intensityof monitoringby the length

Otherrecent papershave also addressedthe contracting
problem. Admati and Pfleiderer (1994) focus on the

as otherswill providethe financing.In principle,an external
investor, such as a venturecapitalist,can enter the picture,
invest, monitor, and become equally informed. However,
having become an insider,the venturecapitalistmay suffer
the same problemas the entrepreneur:Having invested and
having learned that a project is not favorable, but has a
probabilityof success, the venture capitalist may have an
incentive to attractnew outside funds as well.5
Thus, neitherentrepreneursnor venturecapitalistscan be
assumedto provideunbiasedviews concerningthe prospects
of the investment.How can the issue be resolved? Admati
and Pfleidererdemonstratethat a contractin which venture
capitalistscontinue to maintainthe same fractionof equity
in subsequentfinancing rounds as they had in the earlier
roundwill resolve the conflict. This solution neutralizesthe
venture capitalists' incentive to mislead. Admati and
Pfleidereralso show thattheircontractis robustin the sense
that minor changes in the set of possible outcomes will not

make-up of the funds flowing into venture capital in the
1980s. Further,a theory like that of Amit, Glosten, and
Muller cannotbe said to have explainedthe poor returnsof
the 1980s unless it can also account for the much better
returnsof otherperiodsof time, as Gompers'argumentsdo.
More importantly,Amit, Glosten, and Muller (1990)
ignore importantaspects of the real world that deal with
exactly the breakdownthey describe.6One aspectis the state
of contractingtechnology designed to deal with the adverse
selection problem, or the "sorting" problem as Sahlman
(1990) describesit. In particular,stagedfinancingaddresses
this problem precisely. In staged financing, venture
capitalistsmake a relativelysmall commitmentinitiallyand
only commit additionalfunds after the entrepreneurshave
been able to demonstratein deed ratherthan in words the
promises made to attractfunds. Even in the second stage,
only a partial commitment is normally made. Thus, a
minimumof capitalis placed at risk. The venturecapitalists
essentially buy a call option on furtherinvestment,and the
entrepreneursare given powerful incentives to perform.
Additionally, entrepreneursknow that if they mislead the
venturecapitalistsin the beginning,theymay be "foundout"
before additional funds are committed. Thus, an
entrepreneur'swillingness to accept staged financing is a
signal of that entrepreneur'sbeliefs in the prospectsof the
project.
A second point that is often ignored in discussions
regarding the value of intermediariesis that the venture
capitalistcan addvalue to a project.As discussedpreviously,
the venture capitalist is often a specialist in a particular
technology or stage of developmentand can offer strategic
guidanceas well as money. Further,the venturecapitalistis
a consultantwith a stake in the outcome of the venture-a
consultant with incentives. In addition, at least some
entrepreneurs with narrow technical specialties may
recognize their limitationsas captainsof industryand may
welcome an incentivized investor who can help guide the
business towardpublic offerings or a merger.
Finally, at the level of small, risky ventures, access to
capital markets is restricted. Presumably, not all
entrepreneurscan self-financetheirprojects,and not all can
find bankersor angels who will carrythe shortfall.Venture
capitaloffers them a sourceof funds thatis designedfor use
in risky settings.The venturecapitaliststhemselvesperform
due diligence priorto investing, and informationgleaned in
thatprocess can reducethe adverseselection problem.
6Thereadershouldnote that Amit, Glosten, and Muller (1990) fully document the conditionsneededfor theirmodel to hold. They also note thattheir
model ignores aspects of, for example, contractingtechnology that could
addressadverseselection.

11

In sum, while therearetheoreticalargumentsthatventure
capitalists may not add value or may suffer from severe
adverseselection,the venturecapitalindustryhas engineered
solutionsto this problem.Contractingtechnology,the added
value created via consulting assistance, and the
unavailabilityof suitablefunds from othersources all act to
add value in the venturecapitalprocess.
G. Summary
Recentresearchhas shed new light on the venturecapital
process. We have learned about the venture
capitalist-entrepreneur relationship, but we know
considerably less about the venture capitalist-investor
relationshipand only very little aboutthe interactionsacross
those two relationships. The problems are difficult
analytically, and empirical research of high quality is a
particularlydifficult and labor-intensiveprocess, as can be
seen in recent empirical papers. Among those papers, the
work of Lerner (1994a, 1994b, and 1994c), Gompers
(1993b), and Gompers and Lerner (1994) stand out as
examples of the efforts requiredto identify and collect data
on a large sample of observations. Empirical research in
venture capital is not easy. There are few tapes to spin.
Becauseof thatdifficulty,comparativelylittlehas beendone,
and the opportunityto develop results that are novel and
importantis great.

III. Directions for FutureResearch
Researchon venturecapitalis in its infancy.Theproblems
encounteredarenot simple.Realistictreatmentsof the issues
faced in venture capital research will require innovative
approaches.Further,empiricalresearchon venture capital
was virtuallynon-existentbeforethe decade of the 1990s. It
is not easy to do, mainly because of lack of data,but some
good examples do now exist, and unansweredquestionsare
availablein abundance.
A. Angels and Venture Capitalists
Angel investingis a process in which a wealthypersonor
group places funds in a venture without taking on the
consultingrole of venturecapitalists.Sahlman(1990) argues
that"angels" invest an orderof magnitudemore funds than
do venturecapitalists,andyet we know even less aboutangel
investing than we know about venture capital. How
successful is angel investing?Given thatthereis $33 billion

importantin this decision. Likewise, an entrepreneurmay
perceive no need for the advice and guidance of a venture
capitalist.)Are the termsof financingarrangementssimilar
to those of venturecapital?Do they avoid adverseselection
in ways similarto those of venturecapitalists?How do their
rates of return compare to those attainable through
investmentin venturecapitalfunds?
In many partsof the developing world, venturecapitalis
virtuallynonexistent;raising funds for new ventures from
privategroupsor family membersis common.The so-called
informalcapital marketsare often more importantthan the
formal markets, especially early in the life of a market
economy. Sometimes this process is a way of avoiding
disclosureand/ortaxes. Understandingbetterthe process of

advice counter to the interests of the entrepreneur.That
example furtherpoints out thatthe venturecapitalistserves
a dual role as principalin some respects and agent in other
respectsin workingwith an entrepreneur.
These multiple agency relationships can play an
importantrole in determiningthe success of venturecapital
investing. For example, the extent to which a venture
capitalist is already committed because of monitoring
responsibilitiesin the managementof existing funds may
influence the investmentdecisions of potentialinvestors in
subsequentfunds.Is therea tendencyto use less experienced

to solicit potentialnew investors?A new fundwill typically
have ten years in which to create value-and generate
managementfees-whereas an older fund will have less
time, hence less potential,to add value over its remaining
lifetime. For example, if the venture capitalist makes an
investmentwith the money from fund A in companyX, and
fund A has a relatively shortremaininglife, will that short

example, public venturecapitalfunds, and thereare captive
venture capital firms (such as CitibankVentureCapital or
Hambrechtand Quist). How do these different types of
organizationsperform?How are they similar, and how do
they differ?
Sahlman's discussion of the agency conflicts and their
resolutionin limitedpartnershipsdoes not apply fully to the
public or captive form. Captive venture capital firms, for
example,receive theirfundingfrom a single sourceandlack
many of the features and issues that Sahlman discusses.
Presumably they would not inflict the grandstanding
phenomenon (discussed by Gompers (1994a)) on their
parent.On the otherhand,they bringtheirown issues to the
table.HambrechtandQuist,for example,was the most active
venturecapitalfirm in the IPO sampleof Barry,Muscarella,
Peavy, and Vetsuypens(1990), and Hambrechtand Quist's
investmentbankinggroupis also active as a leadunderwriter
in the IPO process.7
Because venture capitalists operating within different
organizationalforms differ in their relationshipswith their
principal investors, their behavior may be expected to be
different: Their contracting technology may differ, the
consultingrole they play within a portfoliofirm may differ,
they may follow different investment strategies, and they
may exhibit differencesin performance.Also, this richness
of organizational forms provides an arena in which to
examine extant empirical results. For example, if the
grandstanding phenomenon is specific to limited
partnerships,we should not see that phenomenon in the
context of otherorganizationalforms.
A related issue is whether organizational form is
associatedwith performance.One mightexpectbothriskand
returnto varyby the formof the organization.Bank-affiliated
venturecapitalistsareoften thoughtto be more conservative
in their strategyand, if so, thatshould affect risk andreturn.
Similarly, bank-affiliated venture capitalists are often
reputedto be less experiencedon average,and a numberof
papershave arguedthatthe age or experienceof the venture
capitalistscan affect the investmentprocess.
F. Risk and Return in Venture Capital
Is venture capital a superiorform of investment?Is it
inferior?The answerappearsto dependon the time periodin
question. Results are widely mixed, as is highlighted in
Gompers' (1994b) brief history of the venture capital
7In their sample of venture-backedIPOs, Barry, Muscarella,Peavy, and
Vetsuypens (1990) noted 87 IPOs in which venturecapital investorswere

industry and as is obvious from reading the performance
results contained in a variety of studies of venture capital
(e.g., Bygrave and Timmons (1992), Brophy and Gunther
(1988), Chiampou and Kallett (1989), Kleiman and
Schulman (1992), and Martin and Petty (1983)). The
performanceof venture capital investing remains an open
issue. The results vary by time period,by type of fund, and
by the degree to which the funds are combined into
portfolios.It is difficultto drawanygeneralconclusionsfrom
the mixed results obtained to date; therefore, additional
researchis needed to addressthis issue.

IV. Conclusions
Much has been learned recently in the area of venture
capital finance. We understandmore about the contracting
technology that permitsventurecapitaliststo manage their
dual roles as agents with respect to their limited
partner-investors and as principals with respect to
entrepreneursin theirportfoliofirms.Venturecapitalistsare
active, blockholding investors who provide monitoring
services and whose contractual relations guard against
failure while permittingparticipationin the upside in their
ventures.Theyuse some of the samecontractualmechanisms
for alleviatingconcernson the partof theirinvestorsas they
applythemselves in theirrelationswith the entrepreneursin
whose venturesthey invest.
In a venture capital setting, adverse selection is an
especiallyimportantconcern.Investorsdo not wish to invest
with venture capitalists who shirk, and the contracting
technology gives the venturecapitalistsstrongincentivesto
perform on behalf of the investors. Similarly, venture
capitalists want to invest their funds in ventures that are
successful, and contractualmechanismscan assurethat the
entrepreneurswith whom they place theirfunds have strong
incentives to perform.Further,the venturecapitaliststake a
numberof steps to avoid adverse selection, including their
own due diligence activities as well as investing througha
syndicatingmechanismin which the collective judgmentof
several members of the industryis broughtto bear on the
investmentdecision.
All is not perfect. For example, venturecapitalistshave
incentives to realize gains in order to demonstrate
performanceandraiseadditionalfunds.Those incentivescan
lead to conflicts of interestwith existing investorsas well as
with the entrepreneurswho rely on the venturecapitalistsfor
guidanceon matterssuch as when to make a public offering.
Empirical evidence on venture capital is not easy to
develop becauseof the privatenatureof venturecapitalfirms
and theirinvestments.Nevertheless,recentwork has tapped
into existing databasesand led to the developmentof some

<-----Page 12----->14

new ones, paving the way for further work. Recent evidence
details the process by which venture capitalists carry out their
responsibilities. Among the recent studies, we find evidence
of the participation by venture capitalists in their portfolio
companies. For example, new evidence suggests that venture
capitalists can time the IPO market, i.e., they tend to issue
IPOs close to market peaks and to avoid them at market
valleys. We also see evidence on the form of compensation
and on investment behavior by venture capitalists.
The paper suggests a number of areas in which further
work is needed. For example, although recent work explains
what venture capitalists do, it does not show whether those
activities in fact create value. Is a firm better off seeking
venture capital or finding other financing vehicles? When is
one avenue better than the others? Why is angel investing so
important? Do angel investors sacrifice return or take on
greater risk by circumventing the venture capital process?
Which approach is better, and under what circumstances?
Do venture capital investments produce superior
investment returns? The evidence to date has been mixed,
dependent on the time period in question and on
characteristics of the venture capitalists and the investment
environment. Does venture capital in fact add value for the
investor? Is venture capital an investment class into which
private investors should be attracted?
Related to both of these issues is a question about how
venture capitalists choose an exit strategy. We know that exit
or "harvesting" can come in various forms, but we don't
know if the chosen forms are ideal. What are the
circumstances under which mergers are superior to public

MANAGEMENT

offerings? When is it optimal to terminate or liquidate a
venture? We do now know that there can be a conflict
between the venture capitalists and entrepreneur about this
latter decision, but we do not know how it is resolved or how
it ought to be resolved.
Finally, one source of complexity in venture capital
investing is the existence of multiple principal-agent
relationships operating at the same time. The venture
capitalist has a set of investors in each fund that is under
management, and the venture capitalist also has incentives
to continue soliciting new funds. Might the interests of one
principal (investor) be compromised in order to attract the
other? Might the advice given by the venture capitalist to the
portfolio firms be affected by the investor relationships? We
have seen evidence that the multiple relationships can lead
to conflict. In view of those prospective conflicts, how can
we model the venture capital process more comprehensively
in order to reflect the realities of a multiple-principal,
multiple-agent market? Is the existing contracting locally
optimal but globally inadequate? New work is needed to
amplify our understanding in this area.
Venture capital is ripe for new research. Enough has been
learned recently that scholars do not have to begin their work
in darkness, but important issues remain that have not been
fully addressed or have barely been touched. Both theoretical
studies and empirical studies are needed. Such studies will
not be easy to complete, but they can make an important
contribution to our knowledge about venture capital. The
risks are high, but the potential rewards are enticing. U
