Signaling value to business angels: the proportion
of the entrepreneur’s net worth invested in a new
venture as a decision signal
DEV PRASAD, GARRY D. BRUTON and GEORGE VOZIKIS
(Final version accepted 13 March 2000)
Prior investigations have demonstrated that, under the assumption of unlimited available
personal funds, the proportion of equity retained by the entrepreneur in a new venture is an
indicator of the proposed project’s quality. Signaling theory argues that this signal of quality
can be used by investors to help evaluate and decide which potential projects to fund.
However, this paper will demonstrate that since many entrepreneurs have limited personal
capital, a more appropriate signal is the proportion of the entrepreneur’s initial wealth
invested in the project (/ ) since it indicates both the project’s value and the entrepreneur’s
commitment to the project. Such information is beneficial to both investors and
entrepreneurs as all parties seek to better understand the commitment of the entrepreneur,
and the ultimate investment quality of a proposed venture.

Keywords: business angels; private equity; decision model

Introduction
Formal venture capital funds have become widely recognized as a source of
early stage capital for business startups. But since venture capitalists fund
only a small percentage of the potential ventures presented to them (Zider
1998), a more accessible form of private equity for most entrepreneurs are
business angels, that is, individuals that invest their own financial resources in
an entrepreneur’s startup business.

DEV PRASAD ET AL .

Previous studies have described the demographic characteristics of
business angels (Freear et al. 1994a, Wetzel 1983); the degree of business
angel involvement in firms once the investment is made (Alleva and Barnes
1998, Sulivan and Miller 1990); investment criteria such as firm size and
age (Freear et al. 1994a, Freear and Wetzel 1990, Haar et al. 1988), and
business angel referral networks (Freear et al. 1994b). From these
investigations it is clear that business angels differ from venture capitalists
in several important ways. For example, business angels in contrast to their
venture counterparts, invest typically in entrepreneurial ventures in
familiar markets with known technologies that are congruent to the angels’
investment objectives. Angels also have longer exit horizons, prefer
investments closer geographically to their home base, are value-added
investors bringing both capital and know-how to the investment, often take
bigger risks or accept lower rewards than venture capitalists, and are
usually cashed-out entrepreneurs themselves who have successfully
harvested their own entrepreneurial ventures and continue to yearn for
excitement (Sohl 1999).
Modelling the actual decision process of the business angel has only
recently been substantially examined (Harrison and Mason 1999, Riding et
al. 1993, Mason and Harrison 1996, and Mason and Rogers 1997).
Specifically, Riding et al. (1993) profiled the process that leads to a
business angel’s investment decision: they argued that the process
comprises the initial screening/first impressions stage, the initial investigation stage, and the evaluation/due diligence stage. Mason and Harrison
(1996) suggested that multiple criteria are used to reject deals at the initial
screening/first impression stage, but a rejection decision at the detailed
evaluation/due diligence stage is usually based on a single criterion.
Furthermore, the due diligence and decision criteria the business angels
employs varies between the different stages of the investment decision,
with financial return criteria becoming prevalent only in the later stages of
the decision making process (Mason and Harrison 2000).
While the knowledge about the investment decision making process of
business angels is still evolving, some insight into their decision process can
be gained by examining the decision making process of managing partners
of venture capital funds, or venture capitalists. In a startup venture, the
entrepreneur must convincingly reveal the value of their venture to
potential investors in order to obtain financial support. Signaling theory,
from the financial management literature, argues that these signals from the
entrepreneur to the venture capitalists help the investor to more accurately
evaluate the information they receive (Leland and Pyle 1977).
The application of signaling theory to the study of business angels’
investing however, is yet to substantially occur. Such signals may be more
important to a business angel than to a venture capitalist, because angels tend
to behave and decide on the worth of a potential investment as principals,
rather than agents and/or employees. In contrast, venture capitalists often
have available professional resources and salaried employees who act as
agents of the fund, either internally or externally, to aid in evaluating projects
as part of their due diligence evaluation (Feeney et al. 1999). Business angels
often do not use such outside experts to evaluate proposed new ventures

<-----Page 2----->SIGNALLING VALUE TO BUSINESS ANGELS

169

since such extensive due diligence is not required when investing one’s own
funds (Wu 1988). Instead, they rely on their own expert opinion and
judgement about the entrepreneur and their proposal (Khan 1987), which
makes the analysis of signals by the business angels important, particularly in
the initial screening/first impression stage of the evaluation process.
The concept of ‘trust’ also plays a major role for a cooperative
relationship to arise within the wider web of information sources, networks,
and reliance structures (Fiet 1991). Fiet further suggests that the degree of
reliance on others in the personal contact network is a function of the amount
of network experience, and is lower for informal investors compared to
venture capitalists. In other words, experience generates trust, which in
turns controls opportunism (Frear et al. 1997). The concept of trust has not
been the subject of much interest in the literature, especially at the early
stages of the investment opportunity process. According to Harrison et al.
(1997), in addition to the well researched factors of perceived risk, utility,
importance of opportunity, and competence of the entrepreneur, the
business angel’s trust in the entrepreneur is determined to a great degree,
by the assessment of the business proposal and the signals obtained from the
entrepreneur. Thus, the entrepreneur and their project becoming closely
intertwined in the mind of the business angel.
During the initial screening/first impressions stage, there are two types
of trust-creating signals that are helpful to business angels wishing to invest
in a startup firm: a ‘value’ signal and a ‘commitment’ signal. While business
angels receive extensive information from the entrepreneur, the latter has
every incentive to present only that which is favourable. Thus, business
angels need from the entrepreneur’s presentation a signal of a reliable
measure of value they expect from the proposed venture. Additionally,
building on concepts drawn from organizational economics, the high
business risk associated with new endeavours results in business angels
desiring a ‘commitment’ signal on the part of the entrepreneur, in other
words they desire a signal of the commitment by the entrepreneur to the
new venture (Barney et al. 1989). Since a new venture typically faces a
turbulent environment in which business failure can occur quickly, the
absence of a ‘commitment’ signal may indicate an absence of appropriate
control and monitoring by the entrepreneur creates the perception that the
business angel is faced with a greater chance of financial loss. The strength
of a ‘commitment’ signal helps the business angel more accurately evaluate
which new endeavours to fund.
The value to entrepreneurial investing of such a signal has previously
been recognized. However, Leland and Pyle (1977) argued that entrepreneurs signal the value of a new venture by their level of stock ownership in
the firm by the entrepreneurs was the best signal of value. In developing
their model they assume that the entrepreneurs have unlimited wealth.
However, since in practice entrepreneurs typically have limited initial
wealth (Amit et al. 1990), their level of stock ownership may not be a valid
‘value’ signal. This paper will develop a more appropriate model to evaluate
the ‘value’ signal for business angels under those situations where the
entrepreneur has limited initial wealth. The use of this signal as a
commitment signal will also be discussed.

Literature review
Venture capital funds control an estimated $24 billion of assets in the US
(Alleva and Barnes 1998). However, financing by business angels is
estimated to be as great, if not greater, than that of venture capital (Mason
and Harrison 1995, Freear et al. 1997). Additionally, it has been shown that
entrepreneurs, if given a choice, prefer to seek out financing from sources
other than venture capital funds (Amit et al. 1990) since investors such as
business angels interfere less in business operations.
The information about new ventures is usually conveyed to potential
funding sources through the new venture’s proposed business plan (Alleva
and Barnes 1998, MacMillan et al. 1987, MacMillan et al. 1985, Rhea 1989,
Tyebjee and Bruno 1989). However, information is available to different
investors asymmetrically, since the entrepreneur will have a tendency and
an incentive to present only favourable information. While venture capital
firms have access to technical staff to evaluate business proposals and
discern such bias, the business angel is less likely to have this expertise or
employ such resources. Thus, business angels are more dependent on the
two signals provided by the entrepreneur on the expected value of the
venture and the entrepreneur’s commitment to the project (Amit et al. 1990)
Without such signals of expected value a business angel may act
conservatively, undervalue the new venture and choose not to fund the
venture since it is perceived not to have an acceptable return. Leland and
Pyle (1977) argued that the observable actions of entrepreneurs, particularly their level of equity shareholding, provide a strong signal to prevent
such under-valuation.
However, most entrepreneurs do not have the funds to purchase all of
the potential shares in the proposed new venture they desire due to their
limited initial wealth (Amit et al. 1990). The result is that the use of an
entrepreneur’s shareholding level as a signal of value may not provide an
accurate perception since the entrepreneur’s limited initial wealth and
consequently low shareholding level does not adequately reflect the true
value the entrepreneur expects from the project. It is precisely this issue of
limited wealth and the associated inability of an entrepreneur to purchase
all or a great number of shares in the proposed venture that creates the need
to create an alternative to Leland and Pyle’s (1977) model.
A simplified example can be used to illustrate the problem of using the
entrepreneur’s level of equity shareholding as a value signal of a new
project when the entrepreneur has limited initial wealth. Consider an
entrepreneur who is seeking funds for a US$1 million project to be
financed equally by debt and equity, in the form of privately held stock, of
$500,000 each. For illustration purposes, assume that the relationship
between the value of the stock and the entrepreneur’s shareholding level (a )
is of the form V = 2 + 8 (a ) where a is the entrepreneur’s proportion of
equity shareholding. Further, suppose a reliable measure of value for the
stock is $8.40. To convey this value, the entrepreneur’s shareholding level
needs to be 80% (a = (V Ð 2)/8 = (8.4 – 2)/8 = 6.4/8 = 0.80). Thus, the
entrepreneur needs to have at least $400,000 (= 0.80*$500,000) invested in
the project to accurately signal the value of the project. This may not be a

<-----Page 4----->SIGNALLING VALUE TO BUSINESS ANGELS

171

problem for an entrepreneur whose initial wealth is unlimited. However, in
the case of an entrepreneur who is for some reason only able to provide
$300,000 toward the project, this would result in an a = 0.60 (=$300,000/
$500,000). Based on an a = 0.60, the value signal conveyed for the value of
investment is $6.80 per share of stock, which is $1.60 below the value of
$8.40. Most entrepreneurs seeking financing from business angels are likely
to have limited wealth, (Amit et al. 1990), thus an alternative signal that
helps to more accurately evaluate new ventures needs to be constructed.
An alternative value signaling model
This paper, as suggested earlier, proposes an alternative and more
appropriate signal of a reliable measure of value of a new venture, which
is the proportion of the initial wealth of the entrepreneur invested in the
project (u ). This is formulated through a proof that develops a differential
equation establishing the relationship between the function of u and the
expected end-of-period value for the project. Thus, the use of u can be
taken by the business angel as a ‘noiseless’ signal of the entrepreneur’s
expected true value of the proposed venture.
Additionally, this signal can be useful to the business angel to evaluate
the commitment of the entrepreneur to the project. As discussed
previously, the business angel desires to ensure that the proper monitoring
and control by the new venture’s managers will limit the business risk faced
by the new endeavour. Agency theory argues that as ownership and
management of a firm are separated, the possibility exists that the managers
of an organization will seek to maximize their own benefit rather than the
value of the firm. The efficacy of this theory to a large number of strategic
situations has been widely accepted (Eisenhardt 1989). Investors therefore,
can expect the greatest effort at monitoring and controlling the business
risk when the entrepreneur’s interest are closely aligned with maximizing
the value of the new endeavour, typically resulting in lower levels of
diversification of the entrepreneur’s own portfolio, with a large percentage
of the entrepreneur’s personal wealth invested in the new endeavour. When
such high levels of personal wealth are involved, the performance of the
new venture will directly impact the personal wealth of the entrepreneur.
Therefore, a ‘noiseless’ commitment signal by the entrepreneur that the
business angel can use is the proportion of the entrepreneur’s wealth
invested in the new project (Barney et al. 1989).
To evaluate the usefulness of u as a ‘noiseless signal’ of the
entrepreneur’s expectation of a new venture’s true value (M) an alternative
model must be developed. To develop this model initially two time frames
need to be specified. These time frames represent: 1) the time at which the
new venture begins, t = 0 and 2) the time at which the business angel exits
from the venture, t = 1. At t = 0, the entrepreneur has information which
should allow him/her to assign a specific value to the expected return from
the project. Thus, in the future t = 1, the value from the project will be
(M 1 x~) where M is the expected end-of-the-period value
of the project,
and x~ is a random variable with mean 0 and variance r x 2 .

<-----Page 5----->172

DEV PRASAD ET AL .

Additionally the price assigned to a new venture is determined by the
investment required from the business angel, and, the pre-funding
valuation of the project by the entrepreneur (Wetzel 1983). If the
entrepreneur plans to raise funds for the project through the issue of
equity (E) only, fixed by him/her at time t = 0, it can be recognized that the
funds required from the business angel is the balance of funds required. It
is assumed that the entrepreneur needs to issue a total of N shares to raise
the equity E. Thus, the equity E is raised initially through the issue of N0
shares by the entrepreneurs at t < 0 and then through the issue of a number
of shares (NPRY), later (at time t = 0) to the business angel. Based on this
plan then:
N5

N0 1

(1)

NPRY

where, z is the total number of shares needed to raise equity E, N0 is
number of shares raised by the entrepreneur at t < 0, and NPRY is the
number of shares raised by the entrepreneur at t = 0 by selling to the
business angel.
Since it is expected that a fraction of the initial wealth of the
entrepreneur (W0 ) will be invested in the project, the amount of the initial
equity raised by the entrepreneur is:
E¢ 5
u

. W0

(2)

where, E ¢ is the equity amount initially raised by the entrepreneur at t < 0
as a fraction of total equity needed E, u is the venture project at hand, and
W0 is the initial wealth of the entrepreneur.
However, in order for entrepreneurs to become induced to sell the
NPRY shares to the angel later at t = 0, the price (P) of the shares sold
must be greater or at least equal to their own initial investment of E ¢ /N 0,
i.e. the worth of the shares N0 raised at t < 0. Hence:
E5

E¢ 1

(NPRY . P )

(3 )

where, E is the total equity raised for project u at t = 0, E ¢ is initial equity
raised by the entrepreneur which is also a proportion of hiswealth, W0 at
t < 0, NPRY is number of shares raised later from the business angel at t =
0, and P = the offering price of shares NPRY sold to the business angel.
Similarly, substituting for E ¢ from equation (2):
E5

E¢ 1

(NPRY . P ) 5 u . W0 1 (NPRY . P ) 5

K

(4 )

where, K is the total funds required for setting up project u , equal to the
total equity raised for the project.
After these transactions, the entrepreneur’s net wealth at t = 0 would then
become [(1 2 u )0] i.e. initial wealth (W0 ) minus the investment in the project
(u . W0 ). The entrepreneur could then invest his/her net wealth, after the
above-mentioned transactions partly in a riskless asset, say Y, and the balance
in a market portfolio B . Vm , where B is the fraction of the market portfolio
held by him/her and Vm is the value of that market portfolio. Thus, the budget
constraint, if the entrepreneur undertakes the project u , is:

<-----Page 6----->SIGNALLING VALUE TO BUSINESS ANGELS

173

[(1 2 u . W0] 2 Y 2 (B . Vm ) 5 0

(5 )

where [(1 2 } . W 0 ] is the entrepreneur’s net wealth, Y is a riskless asset, B is
the proportion of the market portfolio held by the entrepreneur, and Vm is the
value of the market portfolio held by the entrepreneur.
Since project u consists of an all equity firm, the returns from the project
at t = 1 would be the returns available to the equity holders of the new venture
(M 1 x~), i.e. the expected end-of-the period value of project u and a random
variable, as explained earlier. The business angel would have a claim on the
returns to equity based on his/her percentage of ownership, i.e., to the extent
of (NPRY /N ) . (M 1 x~). Assuming that the business angel is risk averse, he/
she will make an adjustment for the risk of the project while valuing the
project. The present market value of the project is then the discounted
certainty equivalent of the future value of the project, i.e., its value adjusted
for the risk of the particular project, while the discount rate is equal to the
riskless rate. Given that a ‘signaling equilibrium’ exists, the business angel’s
perception of (M), the expected end-of-the-period value of project u , is
conditional on the entrepreneur’s signal and is used to determine the present
value of the project (also the firm’s equity).
V (u

) 5 [1 /(1 1

r )] . [M (u )L]

(6 )

where V (u ) is the present value of the project (in this case also the firm’s
equity) given ‘signal u ’, r is the riskless rate of return, M (u ) is the business
angel’s perception of the project mean, given ‘signal u ’, and L is the business
angel’s risk adjustment for the project.
The riskless rate of return is included here because it constitutes an
opportunity cost for the entrepreneur. Furthermore, it has been shown that
investors such as venture capitalists, and by implication business angels, are
no greater risk takers than other entrepreneurs (Dubini 1989). Thus, the
business angel will be willing t o pay a sum equivalent to
(NPRY /N ) . [V (u )] based on his proportion of the equity offered,
(NPRY/N), and the present value of the returns (M 1 x~) from the project
V (u ).
Since the entrepreneur retains N 0 shares out of the N shares of the firm,
the proportion of the total common shares held by him (A) is N 0 /N . Thus,
the proportion of the shares offered to the business angel is (1 2 A ) since
(NPRY/N) = [(N 2 N 0 ) /N ] = [1 2 (N0 /N )] =[1 2 A ]. Solving equation (5)
for Y and replacing W0 in the resulting expression by rearranging equation
(4) we have:
Y5

W0 2 K 1

(NPRY . P ) 2 (B . Vm )

(7 )

Since the amount the business angel paid for shares in the project
(NPRY . P ) should equal the amount that he/she is willing to pay for the
proportion of the equity offered and the present value of the returns from
the project (NPRY/N) . [V (u )] given a signal u , the following expression
results:

The entrepreneur would therefore choose investments in the project, in the
market portfolio, and the riskless asset so as to maximize the expected
utility of his/her end-of-the-period wealth subject to his/her budget
constraint. Thus, the entrepreneur’s choice of the proportion of his initial
wealth to invest in the firm u , and in the market portfolio B is based upon
the decision problem: ‘Maximize the investor’s utility from their end-of~
period wealth (U) based on their equity investment, E[U(W1 )], subject to
the budget constraint’ or:

The optimal values of u and B can be determined by setting up a
Langrangian equation and solving the first order necessary conditions. As
shown in Appendix A, a differential equation is obtained which must be
satisfied by any equilibrium schedule:

As mentioned earlier, a solution to equation (14) requires that the
investors’ utility function be defined. If it is therefore assumed that the
entrepreneur’s expected utility can be expressed using a specific utility
function of the quadratic form, as is further shown in Appendix A. This
differential equation is of the form:

[M . (M (u ) 2 L] 2 [M (u ) 2 L]2 2 [b . u

(15)

This alternative model to evaluate the usefulness of u as a ‘noiseless signal’ of
the entrepreneur’s expectation of a new venture’s value, results in a
differential equation, which provides a relationship between the expected
end-of-the-period value of the project and the proportion of the entrepreneur’s initial wealth invested in the project. Thus, if business angels are
aware of the entrepreneur’s initial wealth and his/her percentage of total
equity invested in the proposed project, they should be able to use that
information as a ‘value’ signal of the expected value of the proposed project.
Additionally, the business angel can use the knowledge about the level of the
entrepreneur’s personal wealth invested in the project as a noiseless
‘commitment’ signal to evaluate the entrepreneur’s commitment to the
project and his/her dedication to monitoring and controlling project costs.
Conclusion
The model developed in the paper results in an equation, which provides a
relationship between the mean return of the project M and the proposed
project signal u based on the proportion of the entrepreneur’s initial wealth
invested in the project. Prior literature has demonstrated that the decision
making of business angels is hampered by limited access to the wide range
of financial tools and resources available to venture capitalists (Wu 1988).
However, information signaling about u provides the business angel a
readily accessible tool, which can be used to help supplement their intuitive
decision making about which projects to fund. The information signal
provided by u can be used by the business angel to evaluate the
entrepreneur’s perception of the project’s true value. Additionally, building
on the agency theory, the business angel can use the information of the
proportion of the entrepreneur’s investment of his/her wealth as an
indication of their true commitment to the project.
This information signal from u can be useful not only for the business
angel but also for the entrepreneurs themselves. It has been shown that
entrepreneurs who do not have the ability to seek out financing sources
other than venture capital funds may have problems conveying the true

<-----Page 9----->176

value of their project (Amit et al. 1990), since the retention of equity by
entrepreneurs who a priori have limited initial wealth is not a practical
signal. Thus, the knowledge that a large proportion of the entrepreneur’s
wealth is invested in the project ( may provide a direct signal of value and
commitment about the project and this should be strongly ‘advertised’ by
the entrepreneur when constructing the business plan for the project,
especially since this model has the additional benefit of demonstrating that
entrepreneurs can analyse their rate of return before making an investment
decision. Finally, this model is the only one to incorporate into the
entrepreneurial investment decision-making process the fact that entrepreneurs are perennially plagued by limited resources, and allows the
calculation of appropriate levels of return, based on their level of
commitment.
It is frequently heard from practitioners, venture capitalists and
business angels alike, that they expect a substantial portion of the
entrepreneur’s personal wealth to be invested in a given project. They are
usually less concerned about what the absolute level of that investment is,
than they are about how important this investment is to the given
entrepreneur. They rationalize, and justifiably so, that the higher the
proportion of this investment equity relative to the entrepreneur’s total
personal wealth, the more committed and the more diligent the entrepreneurs will be in protecting that investment. This way, the business angel’s or
the venture capitalist’s investment will also be protected and its return
maximized. The model presented here establishes mathematically the
applicability of such a ‘noiseless’ commitment signal, thereby, strengthening the connection between entrepreneurship theory and practice.
Prior research has largely ignored the vital role of business angels. The
model presented here provides a framework for future investigation on
topics such as how firm size and the signal from project u interact with each
other, as well as the potential threshold of minimum wealth which the
entrepreneurs must possess before a business angel will consider funding
their project, or the minimum equity investment required relative to the
total cost of a project. Additionally, since the model builds on the
assumption that the entrepreneur’s signals are truthful, the implications of
this assumption need to be examined further.
Business angels play a vital role in the economy. This vital role is
important not only for the US economy but also for many other regions
such as Canada (Sulivan and Miller 1990), Europe (Harrison and Mason
1993, Landstrom 1993, Kuusisto 1999) and Australia (Clayton 1998). A
greater understanding of the interaction between business angels and
entrepreneurs remains one of the largely untouched areas of entrepreneurship research. The theoretical model developed here has helped to establish
a basis to begin a more in-depth investigation of this research area.

Appendix A
In this appendix, we derive the model in detail. As discussed in the body of
the paper, the entrepreneur’s choice of the proportion of his wealth to
invest in the firm u , and in the market portfolio B, is based upon the
decision problem
Maximize : E . U (W1 )
~

(A1)

subject to the budget constraint
Y 5 W 0 1 (1 2 A ) . (Vu )) 2 K 2 B . V m
Or maximize:
E . [U {A . {(M 1

(A2 )

subject to the budget constraint :
Y5

W0 1

A ) . (V (u

(1 2

)) 2

K 2 B . Vm

The optimal value of u and B can be determined by setting up a
Langrangian and solving the first order necessary conditions:
d

and
d

{E . U(W ~

1)}d u 5 0

(A3a)

{E . U (W ~

Re-expressing (A3a) results in:

2 (1 1 r ) . Vm )

(A5)
To proceed further, it is necessary to examine the relationship between A
and u . Knowing that A=(N0 /N) and keeping in view Wu’s (32) comment
that the venture capitalist has more say in valuing the deal, it is assumed
that the business angels also insist on the founder pauing the same dollar
amount per share (P).

(N 0 /N ) 5 (N 0 . P ) /(N . P ) 5 (W 0 ) /[V (u )]
[u . W 0 . (1 1 r )] /[M (u ) 2 L]

Thus, equation (A5) becomes:

(A7 )
Since u is assumed to be a noiseless signal, from the rational expectations
equilbrium condition:
M [u

(A8)

Therefore (A7) can be rearranged as:
~ 1 ) . (x~ 1 L )}] 2 [E {U ¢ (W

[W 0 . (1 1 r ) . (M (u ) 2 L )] . [E{(U ¢ (W

]5 0

(A9)

This differential equation must be satisfied by any equibrilium schedule. A
solution toequation (A9) requires that the investor’s utility function be
defined. This it is assumed that the entrepreneur’s expected utility can be
expressed using a specific utility function of the form (similar to the one
assumed by Leland and Pyle (1977)):
~1)2
G{E (W

(b /2 ) . r 2 (W~ 1 )}
(A10)
~ 1 ) is the variance
Where G is a monotonically increasing function, and r 2(W
~ 1 )) 5
E(U (W

of the end-of-period wealth. This type of function, the quadratic utility
function, seems consistent with Sharpe’s Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM). Since it is consistent with the CAPM, it is also assumed that the
‘market price of risk’ can be represented as:
L* 5

{E(m~ ) 2 (1 1 r ) . V m )}/r

2

m

(A11)

~ is random gross return of the
where: L* is the market price of risk; m
market portfolio; Vm is value of the market portfolio; r is the riskless rate;
and r m 2 is variance of the market portfolio returns. Then the market’s
adjustment for the risk of the project, L in equation (3) can be expressed as:
L5

L* . (Cov (x~, m
~ ))

(A12)

Thus equations (A3a) and (A3b) can be written as:

{

The partial differential equation (A22) is a specific case of the more general
equation (A9). Equation (A22) would then represent a family of valuation

boundary condition at u =0 and C=M(0) for a valuation schedule to be an
