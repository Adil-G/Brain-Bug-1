I. Introduction
Whenever

philosophers, poets, statesmen,
theologians have written about man’s relationship to his fellow man, to nature, or
to animals, the phenomena of trust and betrayal, faith and suspicion, responsibility
and irresponsibility, have been discussed.
The significance of the phenomena of trust

or

and

suspicion

in human life is attested to

only by past preoccupations but also
by current concerns. Discussion of such
problems as the armaments race, mental
illness, the &dquo;hidden persuaders,&dquo; and juvenile delinquency frequently employ such
terms as &dquo;trust,&dquo; &dquo;suspicion,&dquo; &dquo;betrayal,&dquo;
&dquo;faith.&dquo; Past preoccupations and current
not

concerns make it apparent that the concept
of &dquo;trust&dquo; and its related concepts are vital
to the understanding both of social life and
of personality development. Yet an examination of a half-dozen or more of the leading

textbooks in social psychology (e.g., texts
by Cartwright and Zander, Homans, Krech
and Crutchfield, Lewin, Lindsey, Newcomb)
reveals that the word &dquo;trust&dquo; does not appear in any of their indexes. So far as we
know, the research summarized in this paper
represents the first attempt to investigate
experimentally the phenomena of trust.

II. The Definition of &dquo;Trust&dquo; and
Other Related Concepts
definitions of &dquo;trust&dquo; include
&dquo;confidence,&dquo; &dquo;assured reliance,&dquo; and &dquo;assured anticipation.&dquo; The term
&dquo;trust&dquo; is used in reference to the weather,
railroad schedules, cars, and animals, as
well as in relation to human beings. One
element common to many usages of &dquo;trust&dquo;
is the notion of expectation or predictability.
However, predictability is clearly not sufficient to characterize the everyday meaning of &dquo;trust.&dquo; With a little information from
the insurance companies, one can predict
with a fair degree of accuracy how many
people will die on a given day. Nevertheless, one does not necessarily &dquo;trust&dquo; that
they will die.
&dquo;Trust&dquo; involves the notion of motivational relevance as well as the notion of
predictability. If one has an expectation
that something will occur and this event is
of motivational relevance, then the concept
of trust is often applicable. However, thc
most common usages of the phrase &dquo;to
trust&dquo; have the additional meaning that
when trust is not fulfilled, the trusting individual will suffer an unpleasant consequence.2 That is, the trusting individual

that he will be worse off if he
his trust is not fulfilled than if
he does not trust. For example, if a mother
trusts a baby sitter enough to leave her baby
in her care and she does not live up to this
trust, the mother suffers an unpleasant consequence-harm to her baby. The trusting
mother, when her trust is fulfilled, is in a
more advantageous position than if she had
not trusted. She is able to do things she
likes to do which she otherwise could not.
However, the disadvantages of trusting and
having her trust unfulfilled are considerably
greater than the advantages of being able
to do things she could otherwise not do.
We shall define &dquo;trust&dquo; in such a way as
to capture some of the connotations of
everyday usage and also to permit experimental research on conditions affecting
trust. We define &dquo;trust&dquo; as follows: An individual may be said to have trust in the
occurrence of an event if he expects3 its

occurrence

off if one’s hope is unfulfilled unless one
has trusted one’s hope sufficiently to invest in
its fulfilment. "Hope" which leads to an investment of time, energy, self, etc., which is in any
way lost or damaged as a consequence of nonfulfilment, is equivalent to "trust."

an individual
expects the occurrence of an
event when he is willing to act upon his expectation, even though he perceives that non-fulfilment of his expectation (if he acts upon it)
will make him suffer a negative motivational
consequence that he is unwilling to bear. The
extent of negative motivational consequences
that an individual is willing to bear is probably
affected by the extent of the positive motivational consequence he anticipates from acting
upon his expectation. The subjective probability
level required for action under the foregoing
conditions will depend not only upon the ratio
of anticipated motivational consequences but
also upon the "security level" that an individual
requires for action. Individuals appear to vary
considerably from one another and from one
type of situation to another in the degree of

probability level. Circularly,

takes a risk when he perceives that his
potential gains from taking the risk are
greater than his potential losses; hence he
is willing to bet, even though he perceives
that his chances of winning are low. On the
other hand, if a person perceives that his
potential gains are low relative to his potential losses, he will be unwilling to &dquo;bet&dquo;

have defined &dquo;trust&dquo; and &dquo;suspicion&dquo;
general terms which are
applicable to an individual’s relations with
his inanimate, as well as with his social,
environment. One can make the definitions
of trust and suspicion advanced above applicable to social situations by substituting
for the inclusive &dquo;an event&dquo; some such
phrase as &dquo;an event produced by another
person&dquo; or &dquo;behavior by another person.&dquo;
The term &dquo;trust,&dquo; however, when applied
to interpersonal situations, often takes on
more specific implication. Thus, when we
say that Person I trusts Person II to do
something, we usually imply that II is
aware of I’s trust. Moreover, we infer that
when II does not behave in accordance with
I’s trust, II is letting I down; II has caused
harm to I. That is, Person I does not merely
trust that Person II will perform certain behavior ; he feels that II is, in some way, obligated to fulfil his trust.

fined to exist when Person I suspects that
II will do something and I perceives that
the behavior he suspects from II is perceived by II to have relevance to I. In effect, I perceives that he is an object of
malevolent behavior. Suspicion leads to
concealment by I of this awareness of II’s
motives and by II from I of his motives.
Trust, on the other hand, should lead to
communication between I and II.
Mutual trust may be said to exist when
I and II have complementary social trust
with regard to each other’s behavior. I
trusts II to behave in a certain way and is
willing to do what II trusts him to do; the
same is true for II. Each perceives that the
other person is aware of his intent and his
trust. Mutual suspicion exists when each
person expects the other person to produce
a malevolent event in regard to himself
and, in turn, is ready to produce a malevolent event in regard to himself and, in turn,
is ready to produce a malevolent event for
the other based upon this expectation. In
mutual suspicion, as contrasted with mutual
hostility, one is not necessarily aware that
the other’s desire to produce a malevolent
event is contingent upon the expectation
of being the object of a malevolent event.
In our definitions, so far, we have been
concerned with an individual’s trust or suspicion with regard to the occurrence of an
event. We have made distinctions between
events produced by persons and events
produced by impersonal agents. We have
also distinguished between events produced
by persons that are perceived to be directed
at the individual by the event’s producer
and events which are not so perceived.
Further, we have considered events (malevolent events) which are perceived to be
detrimental to the individual’s welfare and
events which are not perceived to be detrimental (benevolent events). Finally, we
have distinguished between a mutual and

<-----Page 3----->268

unilateral relationship of trust or of suspicion. Each of these distinctions is relevant
to a theory of trust and suspicion (1) which
cannot be presented in full here.
Before proceeding to the development
of some testable propositions with regard to
the conditions determining an individual’s
trust or suspicion and to the consequences
of trust or suspicion, let us briefly consider
the concept of &dquo;trustworthiness.&dquo; In its
most general sense, one could say that anything which can be trusted is &dquo;trustworthy.&dquo;
However, a more limited meaning of the
term implies that the trustworthy person is
aware of being trusted and that he is somehow bound by the trust which is invested
in him. For this more specific meaning, we
shall employ the term &dquo;responsible.&dquo; Being
responsible to the trust of another implies
that the responsible person will produce
&dquo;X&dquo; (the behavior expected of him by the
trusting individual), even if producing &dquo;Y&dquo;
(behavior which violates the trust) is more
immediately advantageous to him. The degree of responsibility of an individual to the
trust of another can be measured by varying
either the attractiveness of engaging in untrustworthy behavior, Y, or the unattractiveness of the activities involved in producing the expected behavior, X; the more
responsible the individual, the more likely
he is to produce X, despite either its unattractiveness or the attractiveness of pro-

ducing

Y.

There are, of course, many possible
for the motivation to be responsible.
One can be responsible to the trust of another because one has a positive sentiment
toward the other and wants his goals to be
realized; because one fears punishment if
one is not responsible; or because one’s internalized values are such that one feels
guilty if one is irresponsible; etc. The definition of &dquo;responsibility&dquo; in the preceding
so as to be neuparagraph was

formulated

regard to the source of the motivaresponsibility. It is, in effect, a definition of situational responsibility. One can
also consider responsibility as a more or
less stable characteristic of a personalitysome individuals having more of this chartral with

tion for

given situations than do other
individuals. For convenience, we shall employ the term &dquo;integrity&dquo; to refer to this
personality characteristic. In general, we
would expect personal integrity to be related to such personal characteristics as (1)
the strength of internalized values with
regard to responsibility; (2) the ability to
prevent or resolve conflict in responsibilities;
(3) the ability to take the goals of others
as
goals of one’s own.

Hypotheses about the Conditions
Affecting Trust
III.

Examination of our definition of trust indicates that trusting behavior may have
either positive or negative motivational consequences, depending upon whether or not
the trust is fulfilled. When the fulfilment of
trust is not certain, the individual will be
exposed to conflicting tendencies to engage
in and to avoid engaging in trusting behavior. Our hypotheses have centered around
the factors which will tend to strengthen
one or another of the conflicting tendencies
and hence to increase or decrease the probability of trusting behavior.
Our first-level hypotheses, in effect, deal
with the two basic elements of the definition of &dquo;trust&dquo;-namely, the &dquo;expectation&dquo;
and &dquo;the ratio of anticipated positive to
negative motivational consequences.&dquo; In
sum, these hypotheses assert that (1) as the
individual’s confidence that his trust will
be fulfilled is increased, the probability of
his engaging in trusting behavior will be
increased; and (2) as the ratio of antici-

anticipated negative

moti-

vational consequences increases, the

prob-

pated positive

to

<-----Page 4----->269

of his engaging in trusting behavior
will be increased.
The more interesting of our hypotheses
are concerned with the factors which affect
the individual’s confidence that his trust
will be fulfilled. These hypotheses are concerned with such factors as the nature of
the intentions that the individual perceives
his potential object of trust to have; the
perceived power of the object of trust to
cause the desired events; the power relationship between the individual and his object of trust; the influence of communication upon the development of trust; the influence of third parties upon the development of trust between two people; the individual’s self-esteem as it affects his readi-

If I is reasonably sure that II is going to

The game we have employed is a variation
of the "prisoner’s dilemma," which Luce and
Raiffa (3, p. 95) have described as follows:
"Two suspects are taken into custody and sepaiated. The district attorney is certain they are
guilty of a specific crime, but he does not have
adequate evidence to convict them at a trial.
He points out to each prisoner that each has
two alternatives: to confess to the crime the
police are sure they have done or not to confess.
If they both do not confess then the district
attorney states that he will book them on some
very minor trumped-up charge ... ; if they
both confess, they will be prosecuted, but he
will recommend less than the most severe sentence ; but if one confesses and the other does
not, then the confessor will receive lenient treatment for turning state’s evidence whereas the
latter will get the ’book’ slapped at him."

<-----Page 5----->270

thought the other person
would choose and what he thought the
other person expected him to choose.
The essential psychological feature of the
game is that there is no possibility for &dquo;rational&dquo; individual behavior in it unless the
conditions for mutual trust exist. If each
player chooses to obtain either maximum
gain or minimum loss for himself, each will
lose. But it makes no sense to choose the
other alternative, which could result in
maximum loss, unless one can trust the
other player. If one cannot trust, it is, of
course, safer to choose so as to suffer minimum rather than maximum loss, but it is
even better not to play the game. If one
cannot avoid playing the game and if one
cannot trust, there may be no reasonable
alternative except to choose &dquo;the lesser of
two evils&dquo; and/or attempt to develop the
conditions which will permit mutual trust.7
The experiments to be described below
were conducted to see whether the experichoice, what he

7 There
are, of course, many social situations
which are like that of the game, in the sense
that they do not permit rational individual behavior unless the conditions for mutual trust
exist. Any social situation in which an individual may enhance his own satisfactions to the
disadvantage of another by not adhering to the
normalized expectations or "social rules" governing the situation is of this sort&mdash;e.g., buyerseller transactions, husband-wife relationships,
pedestrian-driver interactions, a crowd in a
theater when there is a fire. In everyday situations, mutual trust is predicated upon the existence of socialized motives (e.g., an interest in
the welfare of others, a desire for social approval) or conscience or external authority or
arrangements which will provide the participants with an incentive for adheiing to the
rules. Generally, if people who are willing to
adhere to the rules cannot trust that other participants in the situation will also adhere to the
rules, there is little possibility for rational behavior except to attempt to develop the conditions under which mutual adherence to the
rules will occur.

mental game would, in fact, elicit the pheof trust and suspicion and to study
some of the conditions which might affect
the individual’s willingness to trust or not.
Observations of the subjects as they played
and interviews with them afterward make it
quite clear that, despite the highly artificial
nature of the game situation, they became
intensely involved and felt &dquo;double-crossed,&dquo;
&dquo;cheated,&dquo; &dquo;exploited,&dquo; and other emotions
which were appropriate to their experiences
while playing.

EFFECTS OF MOTIVATIONAL
ORIENTATION
some of our hypotheses concernthe effects of perceived intentions upon
the development of trust or suspicion, we
had subjects participate in the experimental
game described above under three different
types of motivational orientation:8 (a) cooperative-each subject was led to feel that
the welfare of the other person as well as
his own welfare was of concern to him and
that the other person felt the same way;
( b ) individualistic-each subject was led to
feel that his only interest was in doing as
well for himself as he could without regard
to how well the other person did and that
the other person felt the same way; (c)
competitive-each subject was led to feel
that he wanted to do as well as he could
for himself and he also wanted to do better
than the other person and that the other
person felt the same way.
Our hypotheses would lead us to predict
that under a co-operative motivational orientation, subjects will be very likely to establish a relationship of mutual trust; under

be unlikely to establish a remutual trust if they have to
make their choices without each being
aware of the choice the other person has
made; under a competitive motivational orientation, the subjects will be very unlikely
to establish a relationship of mutual trust
and will be most likely to establish a relationship of mutual suspicion.
Table 1 presents data indicating the effects of motivational orientation upon the
choice to co-operate (a choice of A or X)

secret, at the same time. In the Communication condition, they were allowed to communicate with each other before making
their choices by writing notes to each other.
In the Non-simultaneous condition, one subject made his choice first, and it was announced to the second subject before he
made his choice; no communication was
allowed between the subjects before they
made their choices. The Reversibility condition was the same as the No communication condition, except that after both subjects had made their choices and they were
announced, either one or both of them
could change their choices. They were allowed to continue changing choices as long
as they wanted to. They were told, however, that if no one changed his choice during a 30-second interval, this would be
taken to indicate that neither one wanted
to change his choice.

tional orientation. They indicate that, in all
four experimental conditions, a co-operative
orientation primarily leads the individual to
make a co-operative choice and results in
mutual gain, while a competitive orientation primarily leads the individual to make
a non-co-operative choice and results in mutual loss. The individualistic orientation
produced results which were very much influenced by the specific experimental conditions. Under the condition of Non-simulTABI,E 1

taneity, the results of the individualistic and
competitive orientations were very much
alike, while under the Communication and
Reversibility conditions, the individualistic
and co-operative orientations produced similar results.
Figure 2 presents results for a ten-trial
game under conditions comparable to those
of the No communication condition of the
one-trial game, except that the choices of
each subject were made known to the other
peison after each trial. It is apparent that
an extended series of trials did not increase

<-----Page 7----->272

the likelihood of co-operative choice on the
first trial. Moreover, for the subjects with
an individualistic or competitive orientation, the percentages of co-operative choices
tended to decrease with the number of
trials; this was not the case for the co-operatively oriented subjects. The explanation
of these results is suggested by data concerning the confirmation or disconfirmation
of the subject’s expectations with regard to

of motivational orientation. Somewhat oversimplifying the results, one can say that a
co-operative orientation will produce trusting (and trustworthy) behavior even when
the situational facilities do not encourage
it-e.g., when no communication is permitted and when one has to choose without
knowledge of the other person’s choice. On
the other hand, even when situational facilities

the other person’s choice. These data (see
Table 2) indicate that expectations of cooperation from the other person were very
likely to be confirmed for subjects with a
co-operative orientation but were very likely to be disconfirmed for those with an individualistic or competitive orientation. The
opposite was true for expectations of nonco-operation from the other person.
Taken together, the results clearly support the hypotheses concerning the effects

worthiness. In contrast to both the co-operative and the competitive orientations, the
behavior resulting from an individualistic
orientation is very much influenced by situational determinants. The implication of
this last statement is important and is worth
emphasizing because of the common assumption that mutual trust is possible only
when people are oriented to each other’s

<-----Page 8----->273

welfare. Our results indicate that trust in
co-operative behavior from another can reside in the situational determinants of his
behavior rather than in his character.
The purpose of some of our later experiments was to investigate some of the social
or situational conditions under which mutual trust could arise in subjects with an
individualistic orientation. These studies focused upon (a) the influence of communication ; ( b ) the influence of power; and ( c )
the influence of third parties.

a sizable
percentage of these subjects did
not utilize the communication opportunity

notes of the subjects who established mutual
trust were different in a number of respects
from the notes of the subjects who did not
succeed in this. These results suggested the
general question: &dquo;How can communication
opportunities be used to raise the individual’s confidence that his trust will be fulfilled and also used to elicit trustworthy or
responsible behavior?&dquo;

of intention and expectation.
That is, Person I expects Person II to perform certain activities which are necessary
to I’s gratifications and, in turn, intends to
perform certain activities which are necessary to II’s gratifications; a complementary
situation exists for II vis-a-vis his intentions
and expectations. However, for the co-operative interchange to be a stable ongoing
system, each person must have a way off
reacting to violation of his expectation
which is known to the other and which can
serve as an inhibitor of violation, since the
frequent occurrence of violations will break
down the system of interchange. However,
the nature of any ongoing system is such

that violation is likely to occur, if only by
chance. Hence, for the system to endure,
there must be some way of avoiding the
following self-perpetuating cycle: violation
on the part of Person I, leading to a reaction to I’s violation on the part of Person
II, leading to expectation of distrust from
II and hence, to repeated violation by I,
leading to a reaction to I’s violation on the
part of II, etc. That is, the system must have
some means of restoring complementarity,
once it has been violated. It must have, in
effect, a method of absolution and of recognizing when a return to complementarity
has occurred. In sum, the following elements appear to be involved in a stable

co-operative system: (1) expectation, (2)
intention, (3) retaliation, and (4) absolution.

communication. As

a

control,

one

group of subjects played the game without
any opportunity to communicate.
The experiment proceeded as follows.
The game was explained. It was indicated
that there would be five trials during the
game. Then the subjects were tested to see
whether they understood the implications
of the various combinations of choices. The
subjects were all given the individualistic
orientation. Next, the subjects either sent
or received a note. It
may be noted that
the subjects were induced to send a note
of a given type by instructions and by the

which

write. After the note

and

completed, the game was begun. The
subject and the other person, without
knowledge of what each other’s choice

would be on that trial, made their choices.
After the choices were made on each trial,
they were announced.
We expected that trust and co-operation
would increase as a function of the completeness of the communication. Results on
the first trial (see Table 3), where the subjects had not yet experienced how the
other person would play, indicated that 11
per cent of the control subjects, 31 per cent
of the subjects who received the simple
communication treatment, and 80 per cent
of the subjects who received the full communication treatment trusted the other person and made co-operative choices (i.e.,
they were &dquo;trustworthy&dquo; as well as &dquo;trusting&dquo;). The results at the intermediate levels were consistent with this trend.
Although there were about the same
number of note senders and note receivers
who were both trusting and trustworthy on
the first trial, the subject’s communication
position did have differential effects. The
note receivers more frequently tended to
expect the other person to be trusting and
trustworthy than did the note senders On
the other hand, the note receiver was more
likely than the note sender to violate the
trust he perceived the other person to have,
even when he expected the other person to
be trustworthy as well as trusting. In other
words, there was a clear tendency for the
note receiver to expect more trustworthiness
and to be less trustworthy, despite this expectation, than the note sender. In considering these results, one should keep in

mind that the notes which were sent or received were always co-operatively oriented.
A possible explanation for the differences
due to the communication position of the
subject is in terms of &dquo;commitment.&dquo; The
note sender had, by sending the note, &dquo;committed&dquo; himself to co-operation and hence
was more
likely to choose co-operatively.
The note receiver, as a result of the note
and its implicit commitment, had a better
basis for expecting the other person to be
trusting and trustworthy, but, since he had
not written a note, he had not committed
himself to choose co-operatively.

our research on the influence
of communication, it is evident that mutual
trust can be established in people with an
individualistic orientation through communication. Communication is likely to be effective in so doing to the extent that the
basic features of a co-operative interrelationship are made explicit in what is communicated. These basic features are (1)
expression of one’s intention; (2) expression
of one’s expectation; (3) expression of one’s
planned reaction to violations of one’s ex-

description of game in Fig.

What are the conditions under which a
person will be &dquo;committed&dquo; to what he communicates ? This study throws no light upon
this question. However, our earlier studies
of two-way communication suggest that,
when subjects are competitively oriented,
there is little commitment to what one communicates and hence little basis for trust as
a result of the communication one receives.
It would seem that the situation has to be
ambiguous as to whether the individuals
will interrelate themselves co-operatively or
competitively, rather than clearly competitive, before an individual will assume that
communications are informative rather than
misleading. The greater trustworthiness of
communications in an individualistic as
compared with a competitive situation possibly reflects the greater social restraints
against deception in the individualistic sit-

allowed between the players. The subwere all individualistically oriented.
Unknown to the subjects, the other players
(i.e., the occupant of position II on the
first five trials and position I on the last
trial) were always accomplices of the experimenter. The accomplice on the first five
trials always chose according to one of the
following three strategies: (a) unconditionally benevolent-i.e., no matter what
the subject chose, they always chose column A, which made the subject experience

a

gain; (b) conditionally benevolent-i.e.,

column A only when the subject
chose row X (which enabled maximum mutual gain but which had the potential of
maximum loss for the subject); (c) unconditionally malevolent-i.e., no matter what
the subject chose, they always chose column B, which made the subject suffer a
loss.
Matrices i and ia are similar, in that the
subject’s possibility of gain or loss is completely dependent upon his partner’s choice
but differ in that the partner has nothing to
lose by choosing column B rather than column A in matrix i but can gain by
choosing
B in matrix ia. The results indicate that the
subject is more likely to expect his partner
to choose column A (i.e., to make a benevolent or trustworthy choice) in matrix i,
where his partner has nothing to gain by
choosing column B, than in matrix ia. The
object expecting trustworthy behavior is
also more likely to make a trusting choice
(i.e., choose row A). A comparison of the
results for matrices ia and ii indicates that
when the subject has some power, rather
than none, to influence the outcome of his
partner, he is more likely to expect trustworthy behavior and is also more likely to
make a trusting choice. Comparison of
matrices ii and iii suggests that a further
increase in power to influence the other
person’s outcome does not necessarily lead

an

engage in

untrustworthy behavior (i.e., in
subject would prefer the pay-

matrix

offs in the BX cell to those in the AX cell).
The three types of motivational strategies
followed by the accomplices produced clear
differences. For matrix iii (the only matrix
in which the subject has an incentive not
to co-operate even when he is assured of
the other’s co-operation) the conditionally
benevolent strategy evoked an average of
3.47 row X choices out of 5 possible choices;
the unconditionally benevolent strategy
evoked an average of 1.43; and the uncon-

ditionally
of 1.00

malevolent produced an average
X choices. It should be noted

row

that, although the unconditionally benevolent and unconditionally malevolent conditions did not differ significantly in the number of co-operative choices, the subject’s
choice of non-co-operation (i.e., of row Y)
in the former treatment was frequently
based on an expectation of co-operation
(i.e., it was exploitative), while in the latter
treatment it was most commonly based on
an
expectation of non-co-operation. Further
data indicate that the accomplices who
used a conditionally, rather than an unconditionally, benevolent strategy were liked
more; the unconditionally malevolent accomplices were liked the least. The subjects
found it difficult to understand the motivation of the unconditionally benevolent ac-

complices.
In the last trial, the trial in which the
subject and the accomplice reversed positions so that the subject chose last, the accomplice always made a &dquo;trusting&dquo; choice
(i.e., chose row X). The data indicate that
the subjects who had experienced a condi-

tional
about

unconditional benevolence were
equally trustworthy (i.e., chose colA); both were more trustworthy than
or

<-----Page 12----->277

the subjects who had experienced unconditional malevolence.
To sum up, the results of this study indicate that an individual is more likely to
trust another (a) if he believes the other
person has nothing to gain from untrustworthy behavior and ( b ) if he perceives
that he is able to exert some control over
the other person’s outcome. Further, an
individual who is individualistically oriented
is more likely to respond to another person’s
trustworthiness by non-exploitative behavior
and with positive feelings if he perceives
that the other person’s behavior is conditional upon the existence of mutual trustworthiness. Finally, an individual who experiences benevolent rather than malevolent
treatment from another is more likely to respond benevolently when he has the power
to determine the outcome of the other.
INFLUENCE OF THIRD

PARTIES13

In everyday life we are aware that the
relations between two people can be very
much influenced by their relationships to a
&dquo;third party.&dquo; A &dquo;third party&dquo; may be another person, a group, a law-enforcing agent,
nature, etc. Thus, if two people are both in
the same relationship to a third party, a
bond may be established between them
which might not otherwise exist. For example, if two adolescents like &dquo;rock and
roll&dquo; or two employees resent their boss or
two people are victims of a tornado, they
may develop friendly feelings toward one
another which might not develop otherwise.
Margolin (4) has demonstrated this experimentally. He showed that if a subject is in
a hostile relationship to a third person and
he perceives that another person is also in
a hostile
relationship to the third person,
the subject will develop a friendly relation13

ship to the other person. He obtained parallel results when the relationships with the
third person were friendly rather than
hostile.14
The experiment reported here was an attempt to see whether two individualistically
oriented players in our game situation would
trust each other more if they each knew that
they both disliked a third person. The experimental procedure was to have three
people meet in the same room to take individual &dquo;intelligence&dquo; tests. One of the people was an accomplice of the experimenter;
he was instructed to act in a conspicuously
obnoxious and irritating manner.
It was then arranged that the two naive
subjects would play the game. They played
the game for 10 trials, without any communication being allowed between them,
choosing simultaneously and in secret. In
one of the experimental conditions, the accomplice’s role was simply that of an observer who kept track of the player’s scores.
He was not involved in the game; the players’ behaviors did not affect him. In the
other experimental condition, the accomplice had the task of predicting the choices
of the two players. If he predicted corrected for a given trial, he could collect
whatever was lost by the players on the
trial; if he predicted correctly but there
were no losses, he did not collect anything.
If he predicted incorrectly, he did not collect anything. As a control group, we used
the results of the previously described 10trial game which was identical with the
These results are derivable from Heider’s
of cognitive balance (2), which, in
effect, asserts that the individual attempts to
cognize the various aspects of his environment
and of himself in such a way that the behavioral
implications of his cognitions are not in contradiction. The existence of such contradictory
implications produces a state of imbalance
which gives rise to forces to remove the imbal14

experimental conditions except that
there was no &dquo;third person&dquo; present (apart
from the experimenter).
The results indicate that the introduction
of a disliked third person increases the
tendency to make trusting (and trustworthy) choices. Where the disliked third
person’s outcome is interdependent with the
choices of the two players, the highest percentage of trusting choices occurs; the next
highest occurs where the disliked person is
present merely as an observer; the least
amount occurs when there is no third party
present. The differences between the &dquo;threeperson-interdependent&dquo; and the &dquo;two-person&dquo; conditions hold for each of the 10
trials; the differences between the &dquo;observer&dquo; and &dquo;two-person&dquo; conditions occur
only for the initial and final trials. These
results indicate that awareness of mutual
opposition to a third party may lead the
individualistically oriented players to have
a greater motivation to be trustworthy and/
or to believe that the other person’s motivation to be trustworthy will be greater.

PERSONALITY AND TRUST

We have done some research and have
research in progress which bears upon

between personality chartrusting behavior. The research procedure entails collecting personality data through projective tests, questionnaires, and interviews and correlating this
data with choice behavior in the game. In
this type of study the subject is encouraged
to choose freely without instructions as to
what motivational orientation he or the
other player should assume. Our data so far
indicate a very striking relationship between &dquo;trusting&dquo; and &dquo;trustworthiness.&dquo; Subjects who are trusting when they have to
choose between trusting or not trusting are
very likely to be trustworthy even when
they can gain by being untrustworthy; the

Summary and Conclusions

In this paper I have attempted to define
&dquo;trust&dquo; and some other related concepts in
a way which does not violate everyday
usage and yet is sufficiently precise to permit experimental work with these concepts.
I have described the experimental situation
which we have used and briefly some of our
results. In capsule form, I would draw the
following implications from our results:
1. It is possible to capture in the laboratory the phenomena of &dquo;trust&dquo; and to study
experimentally some of the variables which
influence the tendency to engage in &dquo;trusting&dquo; and &dquo;responsible&dquo; behavior.
2. There are social situations which, in
a sense, do not allow the possibility of &dquo;rational&dquo; individual behavior as long as the
conditions for mutual trust do not exist.
3. Mutual trust is most likely to occur

<-----Page 14----->279

when people are positively oriented to each
other’s welfare.
4. Mutual trust can occur even under
circumstances where the people involved
are overtly unconcerned with each other’s
welfare, provided that the characteristics of
the situation are such as to lead one to expect one’s trust to be fulfilled. Some of the
situational characteristics which may facilitate the development of trust appear to be
the following:
a) The opportunity for each person to
know what the other person will do before
he commits himself irreversibly to a trusting
choice.
b ) The opportunity and ability to communicate fully a system for co-operation
which defines mutual responsibilities and
also specifies a procedure for handling violations and returning to a state of equilibrium
with minimum disadvantage if a violation
occurs.

c) The power to influence the other person’s outcome and hence to reduce any in-

centive he may have to engage in untrustworthy behavior. It is also apparent that
exercise of the power, when the other person is
making untrustworthy choices, may

elicit

trustworthiness.
The
d)
presence of a third person whose
relationship to the two players is such that
each perceives that a loss to the other player
is detrimental to his own interests vis-a-vis
the third person.
