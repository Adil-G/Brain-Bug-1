Venture Capitalist Certification in
Initial Public Offerings
WILLIAM L. MEGGINSON and KATHLEEN A. WEISS*
ABSTRACT
This paper provides support for the certification role of venture capitalists in initial
public offerings. Consistent with the certification hypothesis, a comparison of
venture capital backed IPOs with a control sample of nonventure capital backed
IPOs from 1983 through 1987 matched as closely as possible by industry and
offering size indicates that venture capital backing results in significantly lower
initial returns and gross spreads. In effect, the presence of venture capitalists in the
issuing firms serves to lower the total costs of going public and to maximize the net
proceeds to the offering firm. In addition, we document that venture capitalists
retain a significant portion of their holdings in the firm after the IPO.

THE ABILITYOF THIRD-PARTYspecialists

to certify the value of securities

issued

by relatively unknown firms in capital markets that are characterized by
asymmetric information between corporate insiders and public investors has
attracted much academic interest in recent years. Several authors, including
James (1990), Blackwell, Marr, and Spivey (1990), and Barry, Muscarella,
Peavy, and Vetsuypens (1991) have developed and tested models based at
least in part on the formal certification hypothesis presented in Booth and
Smith (1986). A related body of work, represented by DeAngelo (1981),
Beatty and Ritter (1986), Titman and Trueman (1986), Johnson and Miller
(1988), Carter (1990), Simon (1990), and Carter and Manaster (1990) has
examined how investment bankers and auditors help resolve the asymmetric
information inherent in the initial public offering (IPO) process.
In this paper we examine whether the presence of venture capitalists, as
investors in a firm going public, can certify that the offering price of the issue
reflects all available and relevant inside information. We hypothesize that
venture capitalists can perform this function; that it will be an economically

valuable function; and that the certification provided by venture capitalists
will be both a partial subsititute for and a complement to the certification
provided by prestigious auditors and investment bankers. We employ a
matched pairs methodology where a sample of venture capital (VC) backed
IPOs is matched by industry and offering size with a qualitatively equivalent
set of non-VC backed IPOs, to focus as clearly as possible on the question of
whether venture capital certification occurs and is valuable. Our results
strongly indicate that the presence of venture capitalists in offering firms
maximizes the fraction of the proceeds of the IPO, net of underpricing and
direct costs, which accrues to the issuing firm.
Specifically, we document that VC backing reduces the mean and median
degree of IPO underpricing and that such backing significantly reduces the
underwriting spread charged by the investment banker handling the issue.
Further support for the venture capitalist certification hypothesis is provided
by our finding that VC backed issuers are able to attract more prestigious
auditors and underwriters than non-VC backed issuers. In addition, VC
backed issuers also elicit greater interest from institutional investors during
the IPO and are able to go public at a younger age than other firms. Finally,
the credibility of venture capitalists' information is enhanced by the fact that
they are major shareholders prior to the IPO and retain significant portions
of their holdings after the offer.
This study is organized as follows. In Section I, a general model of venture
capital certification is provided. The sample selection criteria and descriptive
statistics are presented in Section II. In Section III, the comparison of
underwriter and auditor quality and the level of institutional shareholdings
between VC and non-VC backed firms is examined. Empirical tests of the
certification hypothesis are presented in Section IV. The pre- and post-IPO
ownership structure of venture capitalists in the issuing firm is documented
in Section V. Section VI concludes the study.

I. Certification by Venture Capitalists
Third party certification has value whenever securities are being issued in
capital markets where insiders of the issuing firm and outside investors have
different information sets concerning the value of the offering firm. Corporate insiders have an incentive to conceal (or at least delay the revelation of)
adverse information because doing so will allow them to sell securities at a
higher price. Rational outside investors understand these incentives and will
only offer a low average price for the securities offered unless they can be
credibly assured that the offering price already reflects all relevant private
information. This informationally induced standoff can lead to market failure
of the type described by Akerlof (1970) unless the information asymmetry
can be reduced.
Although Allen and Faulhaber (1989), Grinblatt and Huang (1989), and
Welch (1989), have presented signalling models which predict that corporate
insiders can unilaterally convey their private information, there are several

<-----Page 3----->Venture Capitalist Certification in Initial Public Offerings

881

factors which make first-party statements and actions suspect. For one thing,
Gale and Stiglitz (1989) show that IPO signalling models break down when
insiders are allowed to sell equity more than once. More fundamentally,
insiders have everything to gain and very little to lose from signalling falsely
at the time of an IPO. They sell securities only infrequently and thus would
only be "punished" far in the future if at all. Their gain, however, would be
immediate and possibly quite large. While disclosure regulation will surely
discourage flagrant lying and material omissions [see Tinic (1988)], it is
unlikely to be completely effective in forcing disclosure of all relevant information. Therefore, in the absence of effective signalling mechanisms in IPOs,
outside investors are likely to be convinced that accurate information disclosure has occurred only if a third party, with reputational capital at stake, has
asserted such and will be adversely and materially affected if that assertion
proves false.
Specifically, for third-party certification to be believable for outside investors, three tests must be met. First, the certifying agent must have
reputational capital at stake which would be forfeited by certifying as fairly
priced an issue which was actually over-valued. Second, the value of the
agent's reputational capital must be greater than the largest possible one-time
wealth transfer or side payment which could be obtained by certifying
falsely. Third, it must be costly for the issuing firm to purchase the services
of (lease the reputational capital of) the certifying agent, and this cost must
be an increasing function of the scope and potential importance of the
information asymmetry regarding intrinsic firm value.
There are strong a priori reasons to believe that all three of these tests are
met by venture capitalists and that the certification they can provide will
have value in an IPO. First, as the Venture Capital Journal (VCJ) (1988)
makes clear, many of the more established venture capitalists bring companies in their portfolio to market on an ongoing basis as well as participating,
over time, in a stream of direct equity investments in entrepreneurial firms.
In our sample, 53 venture capitalists bring more than five firms public from
1983 to 1987. Venture capitalists, therefore, have a very strong incentive to
establish a trustworthy reputation in order to retain access to the IPO
market on favorable terms. Furthermore, the greater a venture capital fund's
perceived access to the IPO market the more attractive it will be to entrepreneurs, thus assuring a continuing deal flow. Finally, a reputation for
competence and honesty will allow venture capitalists to establish enduring
relationships with pension fund managers and other institutional investors
who are vitally important as investors in venture capital funds and as
purchasers of shares in IPOs.
Support for the second criterion, that the value of venture capitalists'
reputational capital must exceed the maximum possible benefit from certifying falsely, is provided by Sahlman (1990). He documents that (1) successful
venture capitalists are able to achieve very high returns on relatively modest
capital outlays; (2) these returns are directly related to the age and historical
performance of the VC fund, as well as to the size of its investment portfolio;

<-----Page 4----->882

The Journal of Finance

(3) successful VC fund managers are able to establish profitable "follow-on"
funds and are also able to achieve an enhanced deal flow from entrepreneurs;
and (4) the VC fund manager market is a relatively small, tight-knit, and
efficient labor market where individual performance is constantly monitored
and valued. Therefore, the investment in reputational capital by venture
capitalists allows them to remain competitive in the venture capital industry
as well as the capital markets.
In addition to venture capitalists' investment in reputational capital, they
also are large shareholders in the issuing firm. One way in which they might
profit from false certification and take advantage of the high price is to sell
shares in the IPO. Retention by venture capitalists of their holdings after the
offer, therefore, can act as a bonding mechanism for credible certification.
The final criterion for third-parity certification to be successful or economically valuable is that the services of the certifying agent must be costly for
the issuing firm to obtain and the cost structure must be such that a
separating equilibrium is achieved between high and low information quality
firms. Venture capitalists certainly appear to meet this test since the bundle
of services they provide-including
financial capital, managerial and technical expertise, enhanced access to other financial specialists as well as certification when the firm ultimately goes public-is both very costly and very
difficult to obtain. For example, Morris (1987), Gartner (1988), and Sahlman
(1990) all demonstrate that venture capitalists expect to earn a compound
annual return of from 25 to over 50 percent (depending upon the stage of the
investment) on their investments in private companies. Therefore, entrepreneurs typically hand over large holdings of equity in exchange for
relatively small cash infusions.
Nor is this the only cost of VC investment for entrepreneurs. In addition to
very high required rates of return, venture capitalists invariably structure
their investments in such a way that most of the business and financial risk
is shifted to the entrepreneur. As described in Golder (1987), Testa (1987),
and Sahlman (1988, 1990), venture capitalists employ rather draconian
features in their capital investments, including (1) the use of staged investment under which the venture capitalist retains the right to cancel (cease
funding) an entrepreneur's venture; (2) the use of convertible preferred stock
as an investment vehicle, which gives the venture capitalist both a claim
senior to that of the entrepreneur and an enforceable nexus of security
covenants;1 and (3) the retention by the venture capitalist of the option to
replace the entrepreneur as manager unless key investment objectives are
met.
The cost and stringency of VC investment, as well as the sheer difficulty in
obtaining it (venture capitalists typically fund less than one percent of all the
proposals they receive), implies that only those firms which would benefit
most from the services venture capitalists provide will be willing and able to
accept such participation. While the role of venture capitalists in the firm is
1Megginson and Mull (1991) find that 41.9% of the VC backed firms have convertible
preferred stock in their capital structure compared to 12.6% of non-VC backed firms.

<-----Page 5----->Venture Capitalist Certification in Initial Public Offerings

obviously not limited to their activity at the IPO, one of the services that
entrepreneurial firms purchase with VC funding is easier access to capital
markets and the ability of venture capitalists to reduce asymmetrical information in the offering process. Logic suggests that growth options which are
characterized by both greater information asymmetry and uncertainty are
more likely to be associated with new entrepreneurial firms than with older,
more established companies. Therefore, the certification function of venture
capitalists should be most attractive to relatively young, rapidly growing,
companies. This being the case, we
research and development-intensive
expect such firms to make greater use of VC than do other firms.2
The model of VC certification in IPOs developed above yields three testable
hypotheses. First, since the ongoing nature of venture capitalists involved
with firms going public builds relationships with all participants in the
offering process, VC backed IPOs should have higher quality underwriters
and auditors as well as a larger institutional following than comparable
non-VC backed firms. Second, the ability of venture capitalists to reduce the
information asymmetry associated with a firm involved in the offering process should result in a reduction of both the underpricing associated with the
issue as well as the costs of underwriter, legal, auditor, and other miscellaneous expenses. If venture capitalists are able to convey credible information
about the firm, the compensation to investors, underwriters, and auditors
will be reduced since their cost of acquiring information about the company
(personally certifying the issue) will be lowered. Finally, an additional
bonding mechanism that ensures that venture capitalists' certification is
credible is the level of their capital investment in the firm both before and
after the offer. Venture capitalists who retain significant holdings in the firm
give up the opportunity to profit from false certification. Therefore, we
hypothesize that venture capitalists will not be selling a large portion of their
shares in the IPO.
II. Sample Selection

Criteria

In order to test the certification role of venture capitalists in the IPO
market, we match a sample of 320 VC backed firms with 320 non-VC backed
firms in the same industry as closely as possible by offering size.
The universe of 2,644 firm commitment IPOs issued from January 1983
through September 1987 from which the matched sample is constructed is
obtained from Investment Dealer's Digest Corporate Database (IDD). After
eliminating financial institutions, S&Ls, reverse LBOs, and firms whose first
day trading price is unavailable from Standard and Poor's Daily Stock Price
Record: Over-the-Counter, the remaining sample consists of 1,833 offers.3
2Mull (1990) documents that venture capitalists do in fact concentrate their investments in
rapidly growing industries and VC backed firms are able to grow faster, use less debt, and invest
significantly more in R&D than do non-VC backed firms.
3This sample excludes, by definition, closed-end funds since they trade either on the NYSE or
the AMEX.

<-----Page 6----->884

The Journal of Finance

Initially, 390 VC backed offers issued from January 1983 through September 1987 were identified in the Venture Capital Journal which reports IPOs
of VC backed firms with offering amounts of $3 million or more and offer
prices of at least $5. In order to be included in our sample, the VC backed
firm must be contained in the screened IDD sample and must also have an
offering prospectus available from Bechtel Information Service. Furthermore,
any VC backed firm that is either misclassified as having venture capital
participation from the prospectus or has other confounding events at the time
of the IPO, such as an acquisition, is also eliminated.4
Given that venture capital activity and the level of returns on the first
trading day (see Ritter (1984)) tends to be clustered by industry, we match
the sample of VC backed firms as closely as possible by offering amount to
non-VC backed firms in the same three-digit SIC classification.5 The final
sample consists of 320 VC backed and 320 non-VC backed firms.6 Table I
documents the concentration of VC backed IPOs in certain industries. The
majority of the sample falls within 11 separate industries with a large
concentration in the high technology area. In addition, as shown in Table II,
there are no apparent differences in the number of offerings in each year
between VC backed and non-VC backed firms.
Table III reports the differences in offering and firm characteristics for VC
versus non-VC backed IPOs using a standard t-test as well as a van der
Waerden nonparametric test. Even though firms within the same industry
are matched as closely as possible on the offering amount, VC backed IPOs,
on average, have higher offering amounts ($19.7 million versus $13.2 million) and offer prices ($11.18 versus $10.16) than non-VC backed IPOs. In
fact, the majority of IPOs with the largest offering amounts in specific
industries tend to be VC backed firms.
A comparison of the preceding year's revenue of the VC sample and the
control sample indicates that the sample is well matched in terms of operating revenues. VC backed IPOs have $37.1 million in revenue reported for the
previous year while non-VC backed offers have a slightly higher revenue of
4We define an inside shareholder (listed in the prospectus) as a venture capitalist if (1) the
prospectus notes define him as such or (2) the shareholder is clearly a company and has the word
"venture," "capital" or "investment company" in its title.
5In our matching criteria, we attempted to follow the same offering characteristics as the
Venture Capital Journal (price 2 $5 and amount offered 2 $3 million). Due to the large
concentration of VC backed firms in the Office, Computing & Accounting Machines industry as
well as the Electronic Components & Accessories industry, we included 18 non-VC backed IPOs
that had either prices less than $5 or offering amounts less than $3 million. If we exclude these
smaller firms from the control sample our results do not change.
6As a sensitivity test to the choice of control sample selection, we compared the results using
the matched sample to the results utilizing all of the 496 non-VC backed firms that are in the
same industries as the VC backed sample and met the Venture Capital Journal criteria. Our
results using the sample of all non-VC backed firms in the same industries do not materially
differ. This screen, however, tends to overrepresent some industries which have a low percentage
of VC backed firms but a large number of IPOs and underrepresents the industries mentioned in
the previous footnote.

$39.4 million. This difference is insignificant using either a t-test or the van
der Waerden test. The average book value of assets is insignificantly different between VC backed firms ($23.9 million) and non-VC backed IPOs ($27.2
million). The median, however, is larger for VC backed issues.
The mean and median yearly growth in earnings per share does not
significantly differ between the two samples, with VC backed firms having a
somewhat higher average growth rate in earnings per share (EPS) of 76.8%
than non-VC backed offers with an average of 65.5%. In addition, the
average proportion of the book value of debt as a percentage of the book value
of equity is not significantly different (31.3% for VC backed firms versus
31.9% for non-VC backed firms). The median level of debt, however, is
significantly higher for non-VC firms. Furthermore, VC backed firms have a
significantly higher ratio of the book value of common equity to the book
value of assets than non-VC firms (41.7% versus 28.1%) under both tests.
Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1989) document a statistically significant
negative relationship between the age of the firm and the corresponding

initial return. They attribute their findings to the higher amount of publicly
available information associated with older firms. In our sample, VC backed
firms are younger in age than their non-VC backed counterparts. The average number of years from the incorporation date to the offer date is 8.6 years
for VC backed IPOs and 12.2 years for non-VC IPOs, and these differences
are significant under both tests. The difference in ages between the two
samples supports the role of venture capitalists in reducing information
asymmetry. Venture capital participation and the associated certification
allow the firm to go to the public market sooner than non-VC backed
7
companies.

III. Underwriters, Auditors, and Institutional Holdings
As the firm approaches the public offering for the first time, it has the task
of hiring underwriters and auditors to manage the issue as well as to certify
the information in the prospectus. After the preliminary prospectus is filed
with the SEC, the management of the firm travels with the underwriter on a
"road show" to provide information as well as to generate interest with
institutional investors for the IPO. In general, searching for underwriters
and auditors is both costly and time-consuming for firms wishing to go
public. For the VC backed firms, however, it is likely that the venture
capitalist has been involved with other IPOs in the past and will have built
relationships with underwriters, auditors, and institutional shareholders.
Furthermore, each of these participants can infer information concerning the
IPO from their prior experience with the venture capitalist. Because venture
capitalists have reputational capital at stake in both their ability to maintain
access to the public capital markets and to attract entrepreneurial firms for
investment in the future, they have an incentive to reveal information
truthfully about the new issue. This being the case, VC backed firms should
attract higher quality underwriters and auditors since it both lowers these
participants' cost of due diligence and protects their own reputational capital.
The venture capitalists' association with high quality underwriters, in turn,
will increase their ability to place the issue with institutional managers.
A. Frequency of Underwriter Use By Venture Capitalists
An assumption of the certification role of venture capitalists is that they
build valuable relationships with underwriters that would be forfeited if they
certified falsely. Table IV shows that many of the venture capitalists in the
sample are frequent participants in the IPO market. As mentioned previously, 53 of the venture capitalists in our sample bring five or more issues to
7Admittedly, the differences in the financial and operating characteristics at the time of the
IPO between the two samples cannot be solely attributed to the presence of venture capitalists.
From the information publicly available about the control firms, we are unable to determine if
the non-VC backed companies attempted to obtain venture capital financing and were turned
down or simply did not need that type of capital.

market over the time period from 1983 to 1987. Furthermore, many venture
capitalists, such as Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, and Byers, are involved in
more than 10 issues during these 5 years. In many cases, the venture
capitalist uses the same underwriter for more than one issue.8 Out of the 15
IPOs issued with Mayfield Fund as one of the venture capitalists, nine are
underwritten by Robertson, Coleman.
Also documented in Table IV is the board participation of venture capitalists in the offering firm. The more active venture capitalists frequently have
seats on the board of directors as well as acting as lead venture capitalists.9
Given their active participation in the operations of the issuing firm, venture
capitalists are likely to influence the choice of underwriter as well as reduce
the amount of information asymmetry regarding the firm by certifying the
value of the issue to the underwriter.
B. Underwriter and Auditor Quality

We measure the quality of each underwriter as the percentage of the total
dollar amount brought to market of all 2,644 offers ($70.3 billion) classified
as IPOs in Investment Dealers' Digest Corporate Database from January
1983 through September 1987. If the issuing firm has more than one lead
underwriter indicated in the IDD database, the average of the lead underwriters' market share is used as the measure of quality. In measuring the
quality of the underwriter we are assuming that the greater the average
market share of the lead underwriters, the higher is the quality.10
Table V presents the results on underwriter and auditor quality. On
average, VC backed firms go public with underwriters who have a significantly greater percentage of the IPO market than do underwriters of non-VC
backed firms (4.4% versus 3.0%). Furthermore, underwriters in VC backed
firms are also involved in more offers (62) than underwriters in non-VC
backed firms (53). These results indicate that VC backed firms are under8Note that many of the firms in the VC backed sample have both a syndicate of venture
capitalists involved in the company as well as an underwriting syndicate involved in the
offering. For this reason, there is some double counting in the number of issues brought to
market by each venture capitalist as well as in the frequency of underwriting.
9We define the venture capitalist as the lead if he holds the largest stake of all venture
capitalists in the issuing firm.
10Simon(1990) also uses this method in computing underwriter reputation. A comparison of
our method using the market share of the underwriter as a measure of quality and the rankings
calculated by Carter and Manaster (1990) is presented in Appendix A. We choose to use our
method for two reasons. First, the Carter and Manaster sample ends in the year this sample
begins. If we were to use the Carter and Manaster rankings, we would be assuming that the
reputational capital of investment bankers does not change over time. However, this may not be
the case as evidenced by the results of Beatty and Ritter (1986) and the recent decline of some
firms in the investment banking community, most notably Drexel Burnham Lambert. Second,
using the market share of the underwriter rather than a ranking results in cardinal rather than
ordinal values. A comparison of our measure of quality with those of Carter and Manaster
results in a high degree of positive correlation between the two.

written by higher quality underwriters than their non-VC backed counterparts.
In a similar fashion, we hypothesize that venture capitalists are able to
attract higher quality auditors by reducing the asymmetry of information
between the issuing firm and the auditor. In this case, auditor quality is
measured by whether or not the firm uses a "Big Eight" accounting firm.11
Eighty-three percent of VC backed firms and 64% of the non-VC backed firms
use Big Eight auditors at the IPO indicating that VC backed IPOs are able to
attract higher quality auditors than non-VC backed firms.
1"TheBig Eight accounting firms are: Arthur Andersen, Arthur Young, Coopers & Lybrand,
Deloitte Haskins & Sells, Ernst & Whinney, Peat Marwick Main & Co., Price Waterhouse, and
Touche Ross & Co. Mergers within this group after 1987 reduced the Big Eight to the "Big Six."

<-----Page 14----->892

C. The Level of Institutional Holdings
In addition to attracting higher quality auditors and underwriters in the
IPO, we hypothesize that the presence of venture capitalists and the quality
of the investment banker will be used to elicit institutional interest. If both
venture capitalists and underwriters certify the offer price, then the cost of
acquiring information by institutional shareholders will decline. This being
the case, we expect VC backed firms to have higher fractions of their shares
held by institutions than non-VC backed companies.
Data on institutional holdings are available on a quarterly basis and are
collected from Spectrum 3: 13(f) Institutional Stock Holdings Survey which
reports the number of shares held by institutional managers who control
$100 million or more in equity. As shown in Table V, the average percentage
of IPOs held by institutions at the end of the first quarter of the offer is
significantly higher for VC backed IPOs than for non-VC backed IPOs using
both a differences in means test and the van der Waerden normal scores test.
Institutions hold, on average, 42.3% of the offer in VC backed firms as
compared to 22.2% of the amount offered in non-VC backed firms. In addition, the average number of institutional managers who hold shares in the
VC backed firm is 10.2 compared to 5.4 for non-VC backed firms.12
In summary, our results indicate that VC backed firms have higher quality
underwriters and auditors as well as a larger institutional following than do
non-VC backed offers. We attribute these findings to the ability of venture
capitalists to certify the quality of the firm by their historical investment in
reputational capital, as well as to their capacity to build and maintain
relationships with underwriters, auditors, and institutional
managers
through their ongoing involvement in other IPOs.

IV. Tests of Venture Capitalist Certification
Two testable implications of the certification hypothesis as it pertains to
venture capitalists are that the level of underpricing and the amount of
compensation to underwriters (and others) will be less for VC backed firms
than non-VC backed firms. If venture capitalists are able to reduce the
information asymmetry between both potential investors and underwriters,
the level of compensation to these participants for acquiring information will
be lowered. This being the case, initial returns and gross spreads for VC
backed firms should be lower than for non-VC backed IPOs.
12In order to measure the relative influence of VC participation and the size of both the offer
and firm on institutional investment, Tobit regressions are run using the percentage of institutional holdings as the dependent variable and a dummy variable for whether the firm was VC
backed, the log of amount offered, and the book value of assets as independent variables. Each of
the three independent variables is positively related to institutional holdings and significant at
the 1% level. These results indicate that institutional holdings are related to whether or not the
firm has VC backing as well as the size of the offering amount and the assets of the firm.

A. Differences in Initial Returns, Underwriter Compensation, and the Costs of
Going Public
Table VI provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that VC backed
IPOs have lower initial returns, gross spreads, and miscellaneous offering
expenses than non-VC backed offers. Initial returns are calculated as the
first closing or bid price recorded in Standard and Poor's Daily Stock Price
Record: Over-the-Counter minus the offer price divided by the offer price.
Underwriter compensation is defined as the gross spread as a percentage of
the offer price. Miscellaneous offering expenses include such expenditures as
auditor, legal, printing, and registration fees and are also measured as a
percentage of the offer price.
Consistent with the certification hypothesis, as indicated by the results in
Panel A of Table VI, the average intitial return for VC backed IPOs is 7.1%
compared to 11.9% for the matched sample of non-VC backed IPOs, and the
difference in initial returns is statistically significant under both tests. A
comparison of the number of issues that have positive returns yields no
apparent differences between the control sample and the VC backed IPOs.
On average, 61.2% of VC backed firms and 60.3% of non-VC backed issues
experience positive returns on the first trading day.
The significant difference in first trading day returns using a matched
sample contrasts with the results found in the study by Barry et al. (1991)
which finds no significant differences in underpricing for VC backed IPOs
versus a sample of non-VC backed firms offered from 1983 through 1987 that
are announced in The Wall Street Journal. In order to compare our findings
with theirs, we construct a control sample of all non-VC backed IPOs from
IDD that have offering amounts of $3 million or more and offer prices of at
least $5. This control sample results in 991 firms.13 Using all IPOs that meet
the VCJ criteria as a control sample replicates as closely as possible the
non-VC sample of Barry et al. In Panel B of Table VI, we find comparable
insignificant differences in initial returns to VC backed (7.1%) and non-VC
backed firms (7.6%). We attribute the differences in initial returns between
our sample and theirs to their construction of the non-VC backed sample and
corresponding lack of an adequate industry control. While we cannot determine the number of firms in the Barry et al. sample that are in industries
without venture capital participation, approximately 50% of the non-VC
firms that replicate their study which meet the VCJ criteria are in industries
with no venture capital participation whatsoever.
Also presented in Table VI is the average compensation, or gross spread, as
a percentage of the offer price, paid to underwriters by the matched sample of

13
While the number of firms in our control sample is identical to the number of firms in Barry
et al., the average offer size for our non-VC control sample is smaller at $16 million with a
median of $9.4 million. As in the Barry et al. study, however, the difference in means for
offering amount between VC backed issues and the full sample of non-VC backed IPOs is
insignificant.

VC backed and non-VC backed firms. The gross spread consists of underwriting, selling, and managing fees. Inherent in the gross spread is the cost of
due diligence as well as the potential probability of subseqluentliability due
to material omissions in the prospectus (Tinic (1988)). The presence of

<-----Page 17----->Venture Capitalist Certification in Initial Public Offerings

895

venture capitalists lowers the underwriter compensation, for example, by
lowering the underwriters' cost of due diligence. The process of acquiring
information about the firm as part of the due diligence process will be easier
if the venture capitalist has a reputation for having fairly represented
information to the underwriter about firms in prior IPOs. Furthermore,
venture capitalists may be more efficient in disseminating information than
owners in a non-VC backed firm because unlike other firms issuing equity for
the first time, they have prior experience in going public. As hypothesized,
the compensation paid to the underwriter as a percentage of the offer price is
significantly lower for VC backed firms (7.4%) than for non-VC backed IPOs
(8.2%).
The percentage of miscellaneous offering expenses paid as auditor, legal,
printing, and registration fees is related to the level of underwriter compensation in VC and non-VC backed firms. Using a similar argument as that for
underwriter compensation, we expect that continuing relationships of venture capitalists with other participants such as auditors and attorneys will
also lower the expenses of obtaining legal counsel, auditing services, and
printing. As expected, the average of miscellaneous expenses as a percentage
of the offer price is significantly lower for VC backed firms (3.6%) than
non-VC backed firms (4.3%).
Given that the level of initial returns and the expenses associated with the
offering are less for VC than for non-VC backed offers, the implication is that
the net proceeds (the amount offered excluding the overallotment option
minus the underwriter compensation and miscellaneous offering expenses) to
the firm should be higher for firms with venture capital participation. In
other words, the total costs of going public should be lower for VC backed
issues than for their non-VC backed counterparts. Ritter (1987) has defined
the costs of going public as both the direct offering expenses and the underpricing associated with the IPO. In order to measure the percentage of the
offering amount that the firm is able to keep, we calculate two ratios: (1) the
ratio of the net proceeds to the offering amount which measures the percentage of the offer that the firm retains after offering expenses and (2) the ratio
of the net proceeds to the first trading day amount which incorporates the
total effect of both underpricing and offering expenses on the proceeds to the
issuing firm. (The first trading day amount is calculated as the number of
shares offered multiplied by the closing or bid price on the first trading day.)
Using the ratio of the net proceeds to the amount offered, VC backed firms,
on average are able to keep 89% of the amount offered after all offering
expenses compared to non-VC backed firms which retain 87%. The ratio of
the net proceeds to the first trading day amount, which measures the total
costs of going public, is higher for VC backed firms (84%) than for non-VC
backed IPOs (80%). Both of these ratios are significantly different using the
t-test and the van der Waerden test. In other words, after taking into effect
both the direct (offering expenses) and indirect (underpricing) costs of going
public, non-VC backed firms are able to retain a higher proportion of the
total issue.

B. OLS Regression Analysis

Tests of the certification hypothesis as it applies to initial returns and
gross spreads using a regression analysis are presented in Tables VII and
VIII. We examine the relationship of both initial returns and gross spreads to
the following variables:
(1) A dummy variable for whether or not the issue is VC backed (TYPE).

The level of initial returns should be lower for VC backed issues
(TYPE = 1) than for non-VC backed offers (TYPE = 0). In addition, we
hypothesize that the presence of venture capitalists certifies the issue
and lowers the cost of due diligence. Therefore, there should be a
negative relationship between the dummy variable and both initial
returns and gross spreads.
(2) The natural log of the amount offered (LOGAMT). Ritter (1984) has
documented a significant relationship between the size of the offering
and initial returns. Since VC backed firms tend to be larger in terms of
offering amount, controlling for size allows us to measure the relative
influence of VC backing. If the presence of venture capitalists lowers
initial returns, then the coefficient on this variable should be insignificant and negative. Furthermore, Ritter (1987) has documented

economies of scale in the costs of going public. If this is the case,
underwriter compensation should be negatively related to the size of
the offer.
(3) The average market share of the lead underwriters (MKTSHR). We
include the market share of the underwriter in order to separate the
effect of venture capital backing from the quality of the underwriter.
In addition to the certification provided by venture capitalists, we
expect that underwriters will also certify the issue. As in previous
studies by Johnson and Miller (1988), Carter and Manaster (1990), and
Simon (1990), we expect the market share of the underwriter, as a
proxy for quality, to be negatively related to initial returns. In terms of
the gross spread, we include the market share of the underwriter to
control for the size of the underwriting firm.
(4) The age of the firm (AGE). Age is included in the regression equations
as a control for the degree of information asymmetry. Similar to
Muscarella and Vetsuypens (1989) we expect a negative relationship
between initial returns and gross spreads. This implies that older firms
have a lower degree of information asymmetry than do younger firms.
Furthermore, if the age of the firm is positively correlated with information asymmetry, the cost of due diligence will decline. Therefore,

<-----Page 20----->898

The Journal of Finance

there should also be a negative relationship between the age of the
firm and the gross spread.
B.1. OLS Regression Results for Initial Returns

The results in Table VII using the matched sample strongly support the
certification role of venture capitalists in lowering initial returns. In all
equations, the coefficient of TYPE is negative and statistically significant
indicating that the presence of venture capitalists lowers initial returns in
IPOs. Furthermore, the variable LOGAMT is insignificant. The market
share of the underwriter (MKTSHR) as a proxy for underwriter quality is
negative and significant at conventional levels. This result is consistent with
the literature on underwriter certification and is complementary to those
found in Simon (1990). As in Muscarella and Vetsuypens, the age of the firm
is significant and negatively related to initial returns even though VC
backed firms tend to be younger than their non-VC backed counterparts.14
In other words, the presence of venture capitalists significantly lowers
initial returns after controlling for the size of the issue as well as for the
certification provided by the quality of the underwriter.
B.2. OLS Regression Results for Gross Spreads

We measure the influence of VC backing on the compensation paid to the
underwriter using the same independent variables as the OLS regression
equation on initial returns. Table VIII presents the results of the regression
of gross spread on TYPE, LOGAMT,MKTSHR, and AGE. The gross spread is
defined as the underwriter compensation as a percentage of the offer price.
The coefficients on all variables are significant at conventional levels and
negatively related to the gross spread. In other words, VC backing lowers the
cost of underwriting the issue. As in Ritter (1987), there are economies of
scale in going public with larger offering sizes having a lower percentage
gross spread. The market share of the underwriter is also negatively related
to the gross spreads and implies that, in our sample, higher quality underwriters charge lower gross spreads. Finally, the older the firm, and hence the
lower the information asymmetry, the lower is the underwriter compensation.
14In order to compare our results for initial returns, we estimate the OLS equations using our
proxy of 991 non-VC backed firms for the Barry et al. (1990) sample as a control sample.

The results indicate an insignificant relationship between whether or not the firm is VC backed
and initial returns. Furthermore, LOGAMTis insignificant and negative. The quality of the
underwriter lowers initial returns as the coefficient on MKTSHR is negative and significant.
Using the sample of all non-VC backed firms, regardless of industry, results in initial returns
being inversely related to the quality of the underwriter and to the amount offered but
unassociated with the presence of venture capitalists. The regression equation with age as an
independent variable is not presented since the number of years from incorporationto the offer
date is not available for all IPOs in the sample.

<-----Page 21----->Venture Capitalist Certification in Initial Public Offerings

899

The results of the two previous sections indicate that the presence of
venture capitalists in an issuing firm certifies the offer to both investors and
underwriters, which lowers the two most important components of the costs
of going public: (1) underpricing and (2) underwriter compensation.

V. Pre- and Post-IPO Holdings of Venture Capitalists
The credibility of venture capitalists in certifying an IPO is conveyed both
through their investment in reputational capital and by their financial
holdings in the firm. This section examines the extent of insider holdings and
sales at the time of the IPO by documenting the change in ownership
structure associated with venture capitalists. The certification hypothesis
predicts that venture capitalists will retain substantial holdings in the firm
as a bonding mechanism for credible certification. In order to examine the
selling behavior of venture capitalists at the time of the initial public
offering, Table IX presents the pre- and post-offering characteristics of venture capitalist shareholdings.
A. Pre-Offering Venture Capital Characteristics
As a hedge against risk, the majority of VC backed firms have a venture
capitalist syndicate with more than one venture capitalist as a shareholder of
the firm prior to going public. As shown in Table IX, Panel A, the average
holding by venture capitalists in a VC backed firm is 36.6%. Twenty-eight
percent of the offers, or 89 IPOs, have venture capitalists owning 50% or
more of the equity of the firm prior to going public. These pre-offering
holdings of venture capitalists indicate a substantial equity position in the
issuing firm prior to the offer.
B. Post-Offering Venture Capital Characteristics
Panel B of Table IX presents the post-offering holdings of venture capitalists. The results indicate that venture capitalists retain a majority of their
holdings after the IPO. Less than half (43.3%) of VC backed IPOs have
venture capitalists selling any of their shares in the offering. Furthermore,
only three VC backed IPOs have venture capitalists selling 100% of their
total shares in the offering. The mean percentage of venture capitalist
holdings sold at the IPO is 8.0%. On average, 6.9% of the offering amount is
composed of venture capitalists' sales.
In order to compare the selling by venture capitalists with the sales by
other insiders of the firm, we examine the percentage of the amount offered
that is composed of secondary shares. Secondary shares are shares sold by
insiders of the firm. Of the 181 VC backed IPOs that have secondary shares
as part of the offering, on average, 39.6% of secondary sales are composed of
venture capitalists' shares. The remaining secondary shares are sold by other
inside shareholders.
Also shown in Panel B of Table IX, venture capitalists suffer a dilution of
their holdings after the offer. The decline in the percentage of equity held by

venture capitalists is due to both the sales of VC shares at the IPO and the
issuance of additional primary shares to the public. The fraction of equity
held by venture capitalists in the issuing firm drops from 36.6% prior to the
offering to 26.3% after the firm goes public. Furthermore, prior to the IPO,
28% of VC backed IPOs have venture capitalists owning 50% or more of the
shares, but the number and fraction of VC backed IPOs with venture
capitalists owning 50% or more after the offer falls to 27 or 8.4%. These
results indicate that while a large number of venture capitalists give up
voting control of the firm, the majority retain a significant portion of their
holdings in the issuing firm. The large post-offering holdings of venture
capitalists can be used as an additional sign of credibility at the time of the
offer since venture capitalists forego the opportunity to profit directly from
false certification.
VI. Conclusions
This paper provides support for the certification role of venture capitalists
in bringing new issues to market by examining the impact of venture
capitalists on the pricing and subsequent ownership structure of IPOs. The
presence of venture capitalists in the offering firm certifies the quality of the

<-----Page 23----->Venture Capitalist Certification in Initial Public Offerings

issue through their investment in financial and reputational capital. A
comparison of VC backed IPOs and a control sample of non-VC backed offers
from 1983-1987, matched by industry and offering size, indicates that VC
backed firms are significantly younger, have greater median book values of
assets, and a larger percentage of equity in the capital structure than their
non-VC backed counterparts.
One assumption inherent in the certification hypothesis is the degree of
repeat business venture capitalists have with the offering participants. Our
results indicate that larger venture capitalists tend to use the same underwriters with great frequency. In addition, VC backed firms are able to attract
higher quality underwriters and auditors as well as a larger institutional
following than non-VC backed IPOs.
By reducing the asymmetry of information between the issuing firm and
investors and financial specialists such as underwriters and auditors, venture
capitalists are able to lower the costs of going public. We find evidence of
significantly lower underpricing and underwriter compensation, holding offering size, underwriter quality, and firm age constant for VC backed IPOs
than for non-VC backed firms. Evidence on subsequent ownership structure
of VC backed IPOs indicates that venture capitalists are not using the IPO as
an opportunity to cash out of their holdings and realize a return on investment. Indeed, a majority of venture capitalists do not sell any of their
holdings at the offer date.
