This study investigates the effects of entrepreneurial personality traits, background
and networking activities on venture growth among 168 Chinese entrepreneurs in
small and medium sized businesses in Singapore. Personality traits include need
for achievement, internal locus of control, self-reliance and extroversion; background comprises education and experience; networking activities consist of size
and frequency of communication networks. A structural equation modelling technique – partial least squares (PLS) – is used to estimate a path model with latent
variables. The results indicate that experience, networking activities, and number
of partners as well as internal locus of control and need for achievement all have
positive impact on venture growth. Two other personality traits, self-reliance and
extroversion have negative impact on number of partners and positive impact on
networking activities, respectively. The impact of education on venture growth,
however, is moderated by firm size, positive for larger firms and negative for
smaller firms. Our findings indicate that among all the factors that we have considered, an entrepreneur’s industrial and managerial experience is the dominating
factor affecting venture growth.

In a survey of 100 venture capitalists, MacMillan et al. (1985) examined the characteristics which, if lacking, would lead to the rejection of a potential investment
project. They found that five out of ten essential factors were directly associated
with the entrepreneurs themselves. The study demonstrated the strong dependence of a venture capitalist on personality and experience, and less dependence
on the market, product, and strategy when assessing the viability of an investment.
That is, venture capitalists tended to link the characteristics of entrepreneurs with
the performance of their firms. The relationship between personal characteristics

and venture performance has also received substantial research attention (e.g.,
Begley and Boyd, 1987; Duchesneau and Gartner, 1990; Herron and Robinson,
1993; Jo and Lee, 1996). Indeed, within the area of entrepreneurship research,
empirical studies on the characteristics of entrepreneurs have outnumbered studies
of almost any other kind (Churchill and Lewis, 1986). Both practitioners and academic scholars seem to believe that venture success is more dependent on the
entrepreneur himself than on any other factor.
Despite the research effort expended on this topic, the evidence is less than conclusive (Herron and Robinson, 1993). For example, in a study of the effects of several
key psychological attributes on venture performance, Begley and Boyd (1987, p. 79)
conclude that the ‘relationships between psychological attributes and financial performance are few, but suggestive.’ Building on existing literature, the present study
attempts to examine the effects of an entrepreneur’s personality traits, background
and networking activities on the growth rate of his/her firm in the form of a causal
model. A distinct contribution of the study is that it includes two personality traits,
self-reliance and extroversion, which have been neglected in the existing literature.
Unlike previous studies, which were mainly based on data from Western countries,
this study conducted a questionnaire survey using Singaporean Chinese subjects. A
review of entrepreneurial development and its related studies in Singapore can be
found in Teoh and Foo (1997). In spite of the current setback, the rapid economic
growth of the Asia Pacific region during the past decade or so is a reflection of an
underlying entrepreneurial spirit. This study addresses the need for a more in-depth
understanding of the associated entrepreneurial development.
The following discussion is divided into several sections. First, a brief description of the entrepreneurial environment in Singapore is given. Then, hypotheses
about the relationships of the constructs are developed. It is followed by a discussion of methodological issues, such as sampling and operationalization of constructs. Data obtained from the survey are analysed using the statistical method of
partial least squares. Findings of the study are discussed and research implications
are offered in the final section.

The city-state of Singapore has about three million people, roughly three quarters of whom are ethnic Chinese. The other major races are Malay and Indian.
The government’s effort during the early years after gaining independence in 1965
concentrated on attracting foreign companies to establish operations in the country
so as to create employment and to develop the economy. Foreign multinational
corporations are still a major force in the local economy. The government has been
playing a useful and far-reaching role in the economic sphere (Krause, 1989).
Various government bodies were set up for implementing economic policies and
assisting businesses. The government is also the major shareholder of a number
of large local companies, such as Singapore Airlines and Singapore Telecom. Tan
and Tay (1994) comment that the omnipresence of the government in business
may have a dampening effect on entrepreneurship:
Almost everything in Singapore is being planned by the government and what
businesses need to do is follow what the government says. This reduces the need

for entrepreneurs to strive for better results as they will feel that by following
what the government says, success will be guaranteed. ( p. 155)
The unprecedented economic recession in 1985 prompted the government to set
up a group of task forces undertaking to analyse and reassess every aspect of economic policy. One of the task forces was the Sub-Committee on Entrepreneurship Development consisting of the country’s prominent younger entrepreneurs.
The Report of the Sub-Committee (1985) offers a thorough assessment of the
entrepreneurial environment in Singapore, and a candid critique of how the government’s development policies have affected entrepreneurs. The Report points
out that the policy which stresses attracting inward foreign direct investment
‘inevitably forces the local entrepreneur into a lesser and lesser role in the economy’
( p. 1), and that the role of state-owned enterprises ‘became increasingly perceived
as intrusive to private sector entrepreneurship’ ( p. 2). The Report also observes
that contemporary Singapore has a low tolerance for failure: ‘The prevalent view
is that failure at the job or in business will mean castigation and ruin’ (p. 21). Such
an atmosphere is hardly conducive to risk taking. Interestingly, the Report notes
that Singapore’s very economic success has contributed to a diminished supply of
young entrepreneurs: ‘With full employment, high salaries and job security in both
the public and private sectors, there has been no “push” factor for graduates and
professionals to venture forth into their own businesses’ ( pp. 21–2).
During the past decade or so, the government has tried hard to promote a spirit
of entrepreneurship in society. The whole education system, from primary school
to university, is being restructured to encourage innovation and creativity. In fact,
developing creativity has been considered one of the three priorities for Singapore’s education system in the twenty-first century (Le Blond, 1997). In 1987, the
education ministry introduced to secondary schools a thinking skills programme
called Cognitive Research Trust. This programme was devised by Edward de
Bono, the famous creator of lateral thinking (Straits Times, 1996). The traditional
curriculum content in schools has been cut by 10 to 30 per cent to allow more
time for the infusion of thinking skills, creativity and innovation (Straits Times,
1999). Since 1989, the award ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ has been conferred on
successful entrepreneurs, the prominent ones of whom actually become role
models in the country. For instance, Sim Wong Hoo is a household name in Singapore. He is the founder of Creative Technology, a highly successful indigenous
company in the multimedia industry. His prominence is illustrated by the Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s mentioning of his name during his recent speech to local
university students. While Lee encouraged young people to be more entrepreneurial and to take risks, he reminded them that competition from talents working
in high-tech industries of the USA was very keen and that only a few could make
it like Sim (Business Times, 2000). In short, compared with the past, the government is now more aware of the importance of cultivating entrepreneurship within
the city-state.

present study focuses on four major personality traits: (1) need for achievement,
(2) internal locus of control, (3) self-reliance, and (4) extroversion. The first pair of
traits are hypothesized to have direct impact on the growth of a firm. The second
pair are modelled as the antecedents of communication-related variables (number
of partners and networking activities), which directly affect the growth of a firm.
The background characteristics include an entrepreneur’s experience and education level, both having a direct effect on venture performance. Each of these
constructs is discussed below.
Venture Growth
Empirical studies of entrepreneurship have used profitability or rate of growth,
or both, as measures of venture performance (e.g., Begley and Boyd, 1987; Jo
and Lee, 1996; Stuart and Abetti, 1990). Nevertheless, profitability and growth
measure different aspects of performance as growth is sometimes achieved at the
expense of profitability in the short run. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to
combine growth rate and profitability to create a single firm performance measure
(Chandler and Jansen, 1992). Also, as most entrepreneurial firms are small or
medium in size and are privately held, they are not legally required to disclose performance information. Overseas Chinese entrepreneurs tend to keep their businesses low profile and refrain from disclosing information about their earnings
(Redding, 1990). Business growth data may therefore be a less sensitive matter for
them. Chandler and Hanks (1993) found that self-reported data of business growth
and business volume from entrepreneurs had better internal consistency and
content validity compared with other self-reported data of venture performance.
Hence, growth rate, instead of profitability, was chosen in this study as the dependent variable. The independent constructs and their relationships with venture
growth are discussed below.
Need for Achievement
This construct, originating from the seminal work of McClelland (1961), has been
frequently associated with entrepreneurial behaviour. High achievers have a strong
desire to be successful, setting challenging goals and standards for themselves. They
are not easily satisfied with current achievements, and certainly strive to improve
their performance. Many studies have found that entrepreneurs generally have
a higher need to achieve than non-entrepreneurs (e.g., Begley and Boyd, 1987;
DeCarlo and Lyons, 1979; Hornaday and Aboud, 1971). If need for achievement
is pronounced among entrepreneurs, it is reasonable to expect that this need would
drive them towards a high performance. Smith and Miner (1984) found a positive
correlation between achievement orientation of entrepreneurs and the growth rate
of their firms. Begley and Boyd (1987) reported a similar relationship, though not
a statistically significant one. Lastly, Davidsson (1989) found a positive relation
between need for achievement and willingness to pursue growth among small business owners. Based on these previous studies, we postulate that:
Hypothesis 1: Need for achievement is positively related to venture growth.
Internal Locus of Control
Locus of control refers to an individual’s perceived ability to influence events
encountered in the person’s life. Individuals with an internal locus of control

<-----Page 4----->   

587

believe that they have influence over the outcome of events through the efficacy
of their own behaviour; whereas external locus of control is the belief that external forces are the primary determinants of outcomes. The initial conceptualization of the locus of control construct was unidimensional (i.e., internal vs. external)
and has been repeatedly questioned (e.g., Lefcourt, 1981). While keeping the internal component intact, Levenson (1974) argues that the external dimension should
be split into two sub-dimensions, namely ‘chance’ and ‘powerful others’. The
present study focuses on the internal dimension of the scale. Some studies have
linked a belief in the internal control over the events in one’s life to an individual’s propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities (e.g., Gartner, 1985;
Perry, 1990; Shapero, 1975; Shaver and Scott, 1991). In particular, Brockhaus
(1980) compared the locus of control scores collected in 1975 with the success rate
of those firms a few years later. The owners of businesses which were still existing in 1978 were found to exhibit more internal locus of control than those whose
businesses had ceased to exist. In short, it is reasonable to expect that individuals
who have confidence in their ability to control the events in their lives would be
more motivated to actively seek new business opportunities instead of waiting for
them to come. Thus, the following hypothesis is suggested:
Hypothesis 2: Internal locus of control is positively related to venture growth.
Number of Partners and Self-reliance
It is important that an entrepreneur does not just work on his or her own but tries
to bring in a variety of skills, connections and other resources through business
partners that may help generate new ideas, solve problems and develop new business. The existence of partners therefore provides the firm with a larger pool of
resources to tap, and facilitates its development and growth. Studies of new venture
formation suggest that firms started by more than one person have higher chances
of succeeding than those started by only one person (e.g., Cooper et al., 1990;
Vesper, 1980). Dyke et al. (1992) found that for food manufacturers, the number
of partners was positively associated with venture growth. Therefore we postulate
that:
Hypothesis 3: Number of partners is positively related to venture growth.
The willingness to bring in partners, however, is affected by another personality
trait – self-reliance, which refers to a person’s preference for doing things and
making decisions without the help of others. The history of entrepreneurship is
full of stories of independently minded people who choose to leave secure positions in large corporations in order to pursue their own course of action. These
people usually possess new ideas and are determined to make a business out of
them. By electing to be self-employed, they gain greater autonomy in decisionmaking and face fewer organizational constraints. Though ostensibly associated
with entrepreneurial behaviour, self-reliance has rarely been included in previous studies of entrepreneurship. Independence, a personality trait closely related
to self-reliance, however, was mentioned as a characteristic of entrepreneurs in
DeCarlo and Lyons (1979) and Litzinger (1965). In the area of entrepreneurship,
self-reliance has a richer meaning than independence. A person may desire to be
an entrepreneur because he wants to be independent in the sense that he can be
© Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001

<-----Page 5----->588

. .   . . . 

his own boss. A self-reliant person, however, not only wants to be independent but
also perceives that he has the ability to carry his vision through to completion
based on his efforts alone. Such a person does not actively look for business
partners to join his firm, or, when such partners are required, he prefers to have
fewer of them.
Hypothesis 4: Self-reliance is negatively related to number of partners.
Networking Activities and Extroversion
Aldrich and Zimmer (1986) point out the importance of social networks in facilitating and inhibiting the activities of entrepreneurs. A successful entrepreneur
needs not only to manage the internal operation of his firm, but also to establish
external networks (i.e., the boundary-spanning role). Some studies (e.g., Aldrich
et al., 1987; Hansen, 1995; Ostgaard and Birley, 1996) examined the effect of an
entrepreneur’s networking behaviour on venture performance and generally found
a positive relationship between networking and performance. In particular, Zhao
and Aram (1995) studied six young technology-intensive firms in China. They
found that managers in the three high-growth firms reported greater range and
intensity of business networking than did managers of the other three low-growth
firms, matched by industry and age. Networking is especially important in Chinese
business communities because the guanxi (or, connections) possessed by an entrepreneur is often said to be a critical success factor (cf. Tsang, 1998; Yeung and
Tung, 1996).
When entrepreneurs communicate directly, frequently, and in a broad span with
their external business contacts, instead of asking subordinates to do so, their
personal networks are strengthened. They gather firsthand information about the
external environment and develop an intimate understanding of their businesses.
One outcome is better performance. For instance, Duchesneau and Gartner (1990)
found that entrepreneurs of successful firms were likely to spend more time communicating with their business partners, customers, supplier, and employees than
entrepreneurs of unsuccessful firms. In brief, studies have generally found a positive relationship between such networking behaviour and venture performance.
Therefore we reach the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 5a: Frequency of external communication is positively related to
venture growth.
Hypothesis 5b: Breadth of external communication is positively related to venture
growth.
The extent of networking activities engaged in by an entrepreneur is, in
turn, affected by a key personality trait – extroversion. An extrovert prefers to
spend time with other people rather than remaining alone. This construct has
been neglected by most students of entrepreneurship, although it was perceived as a reason for success in small businesses by the subjects in Ibrahim
and Goodwin’s (1986) study. Van de Ven et al. (1984) found that high performing entrepreneurs tended to be more externally oriented and maintained a broad
and complex network of ongoing relationships with people both within and
without the firm. An extroverted entrepreneur, compared with his introverted

589

counterparts, is expected to have more frequent communication with his business contacts, and to have a larger number of contacts or a greater breadth of
communication.
Hypothesis 6a: Extroversion is positively related to frequency of external
communication.
Hypothesis 6b: Extroversion is positively related to breadth of external
communication.
Education
Although there have been colourful stories of school drop-outs becoming highly
successful entrepreneurs, the increasing complexity of the business environment
worldwide seems to indicate that education is an essential entrepreneurial quality.
Cooper and Dunkelberg (1987) and Thompson (1986) reported that entrepreneurs
in their Canadian and US samples had a significantly higher level of education
than the general population. Similarly, Robinson and Sexton (1994) found that
entrepreneurs had a higher level of education than those in the waged and salaried
sector. They also found that there were positive relationships between the level of
education and earnings from self-employment.
Evidence concerning the effect of education on venture performance is,
however, not conclusive. The level of education and training, for instance, was perceived by South Pacific entrepreneurs as a critical success factor ( Yusuf, 1995).
Robinson and Sexton (1994) found that there were positive relationships between
the level of education and venture performance. Nevertheless, in a study of 48
new start-up firms in Korea, education was found to be only positively correlated
with profitability, but not with growth ( Jo and Lee, 1996). The study of Dyke et
al. (1992) reported both positive and negative relationships between the level of
education of the business owner and the performance variables. Stuart and Abetti
(1990) even found that education level was negatively related to the performance
of technical firms. In a recent survey of 151 Singaporean entrepreneurs in small
and medium sized firms, Tan and Tay (1994) found that the education level of the
owner was also negatively correlated with sales growth.
In spite of the contradictory findings, we tend to believe that, in general, education has a positive impact on the growth of a firm because education equips an
individual with analytical and technical skills, which are essential to managing a
business. In a survey of 100 entrepreneurs and chief executive officers in America’s
fastest growing entrepreneurial firms conducted by Hood and Young (1993), the
entrepreneur subjects strongly believed that the vast majority of knowledge that
was required to become a successful entrepreneur could be taught (at school). The
contradictory findings about the relationship between education level and venture
success may be largely due to the confounding effect of firm size.[1] None of the
studies mentioned above have controlled for firm size. The education levels of
entrepreneurs may contribute to venture growth to a varied degree, which is
moderated by firm size. That is, the contribution of entrepreneurs’ education levels
to venture growth for large firms may be more significant than it is for small firms.
This is because, in general, the operations of larger firms are relatively more
complex, need more planning and more knowledge. Hence we advance the
following two hypotheses:
© Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001

<-----Page 7----->590

. .   . . . 

Hypothesis 7: Education level is positively related to venture growth.
Hypothesis 7a: The relationship between education level and venture growth is
stronger for larger firms than it is for smaller firms.
Experience
Generally speaking, an entrepreneur’s experience consists of three main components: entrepreneurial, industrial and managerial. Entrepreneurial experience
refers to ‘the number of previous new venture involvements and the level of the
management role played in such ventures’ (Stuart and Abetti, 1990, p. 151). Industrial experience refers to experience in the industry, which the venture is in.
Managerial experience is the total experience in management regardless of the
industry. The present study focuses on managerial and industrial experience. As
Gasse (1982) pointed out, an entrepreneur’s experience can influence performance
positively or negatively. For example, prior experience can be a stumbling block
when drastic strategic change is called for. In Jo and Lee’s (1996) study, managerial experience affected performance negatively, whereas industrial experience had
a good influence on overall performance.
Most studies, however, reported a positive relationship between prior experience and venture performance. For instance, Stuart and Abetti (1990) reported a
positive effect from managerial experience; Van de Van et al. (1984) and Vesper
(1980) both reported positive effects from industrial experience; Dyke et al.
(1992) reported a positive effect from both managerial and industrial experience.
Duchesneau and Gartner (1990) used the concept of ‘breadth of managerial
experience’, which combined managerial and industrial experience, and found
that combined experience had a significant effect on venture successes. It seems
that the existing evidence generally supports a positive relationship between an
entrepreneur’s experience and performance.
Hypothesis 8: Experience is positively related to venture growth.
The above hypotheses have been formulated based on insights from the existing
literature. The steps taken to test these hypotheses are discussed in the next section.
As a visual recap, figure 1 shows the constructs and their linkages in a causal model.

Sample
A questionnaire survey research method was used to seek responses from Chinese
entrepreneurs of small and medium sized firms in Singapore. Three interviewers
telephoned potential respondents and solicited personal interviews, according to
a sample frame provided by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Singapore,
which was supplemented by randomly selected entrepreneurs listed in the Yellow
Pages. In addition to reading the background references, these interviewers had
been briefed on the objectives of this study and trained in interviewing techniques.
The strength of this method lies with the clarification of respondents’ queries, if
any, on the spot by the interviewers. This minimized misinterpretation of the
questions. Using a primary draft questionnaire, a pilot test was conducted with 26

591

Chinese entrepreneurs, whose responses were excluded from the final study. The
questionnaire was revised using the feedback from the pilot study. All the data were
collected in late 1996.
A total of 210 entrepreneurs were telephoned by the interviewers and 168 personal interviews were secured, all of which produced usable questionnaires. Male
respondents constituted 68 per cent, and 44 per cent of the respondents were aged
35 or below. This group of entrepreneurs was generally well educated – 37 per
cent had university degrees. The average length of industrial and managerial
experiences was 8 and 6.5 years respectively. Most of the firms were small in size,
with 82 per cent employing 20 staff or less. Only 15 per cent of the firms were in
the manufacturing sector; the rest were mostly in service industries such as retail
and wholesale businesses.
Measures
Venture growth was assessed by two items, growth rate of sales and profit. As all
of the companies in this study were privately held and did not disclose financial
information to the public, only self-reported data were available. The respondents
were requested to indicate the cumulative growth of their businesses with respect
to each of the two items for the past three years. The growth rates were grouped
into six brackets for the respondent to choose from. These rates range from ‘less
than 5 per cent’ to ‘greater than 100 per cent’. Brackets were used because of a
possible reluctance to reveal precise financial data. The convenience of categorical options may also have increased the questionnaire completion rate.
The four personality traits were measured by multiple indicators, with a sevenpoint scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. A sample of
the indicators is presented in the Appendix. Four items were constructed to
measure need for achievement. These measures were based on the EPPS manual
(Edwards, 1959). Internal locus of control was measured by seven items mainly
from the internal component of Levenson’s (1974) IPC scale. The four indicators
of self-reliance were mainly adapted from Duchesneau (1987). Extroversion was
measured by 12 items from Eysenck et al. (1985).
For networking activities, we looked at four popular modes of communication,
namely, face-to-face, telephone, facsimile and mail. (The option of electronic mail
was dropped because it was found to be unpopular among the respondents in our
pilot test.) Respondents were asked to indicate the frequency of communication
with their business contacts for each communication mode on a five-point scale
ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘daily’. In addition to frequency, we also examined the
breadth of communication. Respondents were requested to fill out the number of
contacts made to discuss routine business matters, and the number made to discuss
strategic business matters with respect to each of the four communication modes,
resulting in eight measures. Finally, they were also asked to indicate their level of
education (from no formal education to postgraduate), years of managerial and
industrial experience (including experience obtained before their firms were
established), and the number of business partners in their firms.
Model Estimation
The path diagram in figure 1 was estimated using a partial least squares (PLS)
latent path model developed by Wold (1982), and as implemented by Lohmöller
(1989). PLS is similar to LISREL in that both structural relations among latent
© Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001

<-----Page 9----->592

. .   . . . 

variables and the relationships between latent variables and observed indicators can be modelled, but PLS has two advantages over LISREL for this study.
PLS does not require multivariate normal data as does the LISREL maximum
likelihood estimation, and PLS is suitable for the analysis of small samples (Wold,
1986), while LISREL requires substantially larger samples (Fornell and Bookstein,
1982).
PLS was chosen in preference to traditional multiple regression and path analysis procedures for three reasons. First, in the PLS procedure, relationships among
latent variables are estimated and tested within the context of a measurement
model that explicitly assumes measurement errors in the observable variables,
whereas traditional multiple regression and path analysis assume that variables
have been measured free of errors, an assumption that in the social sciences is
often questionable (Fornell, 1982). Second, PLS allows combined regression and
factor analysis within the same statistical procedure, because factors or latent variables created as linear combinations of observed indicators in the first stage are
then used in simultaneous regressions with the latent variables in an iterative procedure (Wold, 1982). In traditional multiple regression and path analysis, scales of
the latent variables are created by either averaging, summing, or according to some
kind of factor analysis of observed variables, the results then are imported into a
regression (or path) model. The assumption is that such scores are portable, an
assumption that Fornell (1987) argued is not tenable. Third, PLS generates a
variety of reliability and validity statistics that are calculated in the context of the
theoretical model under investigation, while in traditional regression and path
analysis procedures the calculation of such statistics (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha) is
independent of the model being tested. The measurement model of the PLS procedure can be defined as either a reflective or formative mode. The reflective mode
is used for a construct that is viewed as the underlying factor giving rise to observable variables such as attitude and personality (Fornell and Bookstein, 1982). In
contrast, the formative mode is used for a construct that is modelled as explanatory combinations of its indicators. In other words, a construct in the formative
mode is viewed as the effect of its indicators. All constructs in figure 1 are
modelled as reflective, according to the classic measurement theory.
PLS is a nonparametric estimation procedure. It does not offer significance tests
based on statistical distributions. However, a jackknife procedure packaged in the
PLS software (Lohmöller, 1989) was used in this study to calculate the standard
deviation for parameter estimates and generate a t-approximate for those estimates. In PLS, the path coefficients are standardized regression coefficients; the
loadings are similar to factor loadings. Readers not familiar with the technique can
easily interpret the results by considering them in the context of regression and
factor analysis.
For testing the varied relations between education level and venture growth
moderated by firm size, the 168-respondent sample was split into two sub-samples
of about equal size, which is a widely used practice for comparing two groups in
structural equation modelling (Byrne, 1998; Delios and Beamish, 1999; Simonin,
1999). There are 79 observations in the sub-sample for smaller firms (with seven
or less employees, an average of 3.7 employees) and 78 observations for larger
firms (with nine to 400 employees, an average of 36.3 employees). The remaining
11 observations, which were excluded from the analysis, are firms with eight
employees. A comparison of the path coefficients illustrated in figure 1 resulting

from estimations using smaller and larger firm sub-samples enables the investigation of the moderating effect of firm size on the contribution of education on
venture growth, as well as exploring its moderating effects on other relations.

Model Assessment and Statistical Results
Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) system for evaluating structural equation models
was used to assess the measurement and overall structural model. Table I lists the
estimates needed for assessing these models. With the exception of two of the 43
indicators, the loadings for all multiple-item constructs are positive and high
(>0.65), indicating the convergence of the indicators with their responding underlying constructs. Also, the convergent reliability of all constructs, as assessed by the
average variance extracted (AVE), is above the critical value of 0.5, indicating that
all have explained more than 50 per cent of the variance in their observable measures. The alpha coefficients are also all above the critical value of 0.7 (Nunnally,
1978).
One criterion for assessing discriminant validity is that the correlation of a construct with its indicators (i.e., the square root of the AVE) should exceed the
correlation between that construct and any other. In all cases, these values (on the

diagonal of the matrix in table II) are considerably higher than any bi-variate
correlation between constructs. This suggests that there is strong discriminant
validity, as each construct is more highly correlated with its measures than with
any other construct.
The structural model was evaluated by the R2 of the dependent construct. As
indicated in table I, the R2 for the ultimate dependent construct, venture growth,
was 0.25 with a p-value <0.01 using Miller’s F-test (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).
The structural model is therefore considered appropriate because a significant
portion of the variance in the dependent constructs has been explained by the
independent constructs. In short, the assessment of both the measurement and
structural models indicates that the results of the PLS model are acceptable.
Figure 1 presents the path coefficients of the structural model. It should be
noted, however, that for each hypothetical relation, three path coefficients are
listed; these were estimated using three different samples. The coefficients on the
top, in bold, were estimated using the entire sample (168 cases); those in the middle,
in italics, were estimated from the sub-sample of larger firms; and those on the
bottom were estimated using the sub-sample of smaller firms. The two structural
models estimated using two sub-samples exhibit satisfactory measurement
property (convergent validity and reliability) which is comparable with that of the
model for the entire sample. The R2 of the model for smaller firms is the highest
(0.32) among the three, indicating that the structural model explains the smaller
firms better than larger firms.
All of the paths estimated from the entire sample, except education, are significant at a level of p < 0.01, and therefore receive support. Contrary to our
expectation, for Hypothesis 7 (education is positively related to venture growth)
the related path coefficient is negative (-0.06, p < 0.01). Hypothesis 7a (the
path between education and venture growth moderated by firm size) was tested
by comparing the corresponding coefficients, one estimated from the sub-sample
of larger firms (0.07), and the other estimated from the sub-sample of smaller
firms (-0.19). A t-value of 371.43 (with 155 degrees of freedom) indicates that
the coefficient for the larger-firm sub-sample (0.07) is statistically different from
that for the smaller firm sub-sample (-0.19) with p < 0.00. Thus, Hypothesis 7a

was supported, and we may conclude that the contribution of education level
to venture growth of larger firms is statistically greater than that of smaller
firms.
It is interesting to note that for both larger and smaller firms, the coefficients
for Hypothesis 1 (need for achievement is positively related to venture growth),
Hypothesis 3 (number of partners is positively related to venture growth), Hypothesis 4 (self-reliance is negatively related to number of partners), Hypothesis 6a
(extroversion is positively related to frequency of external communications), and
Hypothesis 8 (experience is positively related to venture growth) are comparable.
However, those for Hypotheses 2, 5a, 5b and 6b, in addition to 7a, are quite different. Entrepreneurs of larger firms with higher growth rates exhibit more internal locus of control, which, however, has little to do with growth rates of smaller
firms (for Hypothesis 2). For larger firms, the entrepreneur’s communication frequency with his or her network has no effect on venture growth; whereas for
smaller firms, communication frequency does have a strong and positive effect on
venture growth (for Hypothesis 5a). Finally, communication network size seems to
contribute to venture growth more for larger firms than it does for smaller firms
(for Hypothesis 5b). Extroverted entrepreneurs in larger firms tend to have a
limited network to communicate with, while those of smaller firms tend to have
a larger communication network (for Hypothesis 6b).

This study mainly investigates the effects of three groups of variables, entrepreneurs’ personalities, backgrounds and networking activities on venture growth.
Among the four personality variables, two (need for achievement and internal
locus of control) were posited to have direct impact on venture growth. Their path
coefficients are 0.14 and 0.08 respectively. The other two personality variables
(self-reliance and extroversion) were posited as having indirect effects on venture
growth, while their direct impact can be calculated, -0.03 for the former (-0.29
¥ 0.09) and 0.02 for the latter (0.14 ¥ 0.17 + 0.01 ¥ 0.06). Need for achievement
is therefore the personality trait that has the greatest impact on venture performance. This result is not surprising. As mentioned earlier, Singapore is a society
with a low tolerance for failure. The fear of failure naturally leads to a strong desire
to succeed, and venture growth is a clear indicator of business success. Nevertheless the impact of need for achievement is substantially smaller than that of
experience (0.31). Our model indicates that among all the factors considered, an
entrepreneur’s industrial and managerial experience has the greatest effect on
venture growth. The positive effects of the networking activities (frequency and
breadth of external communication) on growth confirm, to a certain extent, the
importance of guanxi in Chinese business communities.
Contrary to what was expected, education has a negative effect on venture
growth, but the effect is minimal. This is, however, not surprising, because the
effect of education on venture growth may well be moderated by firm size. Our
findings show that for larger firms, education does have a small, but positive effect
on venture growth. This is a reasonable result because the operations of larger
firms are more complicated and need more knowledge, some of which can be
gained from formal education. In particular, larger firms engage in more interna© Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001

tional trade and foreign direct investment activities, which require English proficiency and a considerable amount of book knowledge. Larger firms are also more
likely to make use of information technology and e-commerce, and education
definitely helps in these areas. Nonetheless, for smaller firms, the entrepreneur’s
education level may even have a negative effect on venture growth. Education plays
a less important role in running smaller firms because they are simpler. In the case
of Singapore, since the more educated people have been drawn into the private
sector or have opted for professional jobs, ‘those with less formal education seem
to be more venturesome’ (Economic Committee, 1986, p. 129).
Our study makes four main contributions to entrepreneurship literature. First,
there have been heated debates about whether entrepreneurs can be differentiated
from non-entrepreneurs by a set of personality traits (e.g., Carland et al., 1984,
1988; Garnter, 1988). This issue has continued to attract interest from researchers
(e.g., Begley, 1995; Busenitz and Barney, 1997; Chen et al., 1998; Johnson, 1990;
Miner, 1990). While this study does not directly participate in the debates, it does
show that personality traits in general are not important factors affecting venture
growth. Our findings are consistent with Begley and Boyd (1987), who found that
there was little relationship between psychological attributes and financial performance. The dominant impact of experience upon growth in our model suggests
that students of entrepreneurship need to shift their attention from entrepreneurial traits to entrepreneurial skills. Studies have indicated that these skills can be
developed through learning-by-doing (Collins and Moore, 1970; Gartner, 1984).
A careful examination of the intricate relationship between an entrepreneur’s
experience, learning and skills may lead to a better understanding of venture performance as well as the entrepreneurial process. Chandler and Jansen’s (1992)
study offers an example of research in this direction. They focus on how venture
performance is affected by a business founder’s self-assessed competence, which
incorporates the founder’s experience.
Second, previous studies of entrepreneurial characteristics fail to take the effect
of firm size into account. Our study clearly shows that firm size is a significant
moderating factor. Although some of the relations postulated in the model hold
for both smaller and larger firms, others are moderated by firm size. The most
drastic cases are the relations between education and venture growth, and between
extroversion and breadth of external communication; the related coefficients have
opposite signs for smaller and larger firms. While, as noted earlier, the moderating effect of firm size on the former relation makes intuitive sense, the moderating effect on the latter relation requires further research. In short, more empirical
work is required to examine and explain these and other differences affected by
firm size.
Third, this study is a significant improvement over previous studies in terms of
techniques of analysis. Almost all of the existing studies in the same stream use
conventional multivariate techniques (e.g., multiple regression, factor analysis,
cluster analysis, etc.). This study, however, used PLS, one type of structural equation model with multiple-item measures, which offers at least two types of advantage over the traditional approach, namely construct validity and integrative
modelling. The assessment of construct validity consists of three components:
(1) Content validity – a behavioural construct usually exhibits multiple manifestations, which should be measured by multiple items.
© Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001

<-----Page 15----->598

. .   . . . 

(2) Other validity – a structural equation modelling approach such as PLS is
capable of assessing the convergent validity of a construct (i.e., if all of the
measurement items converge to the construct to be measured), and also
affords an examination of the discriminant validity of a construct (i.e., if a
construct differs considerably from another related construct).
(3) Measurement error – while the conventional approach typically assumes no
measurement errors, PLS explicitly examines the magnitude of measurement errors at the construct level (e.g., average variance extracted).
Additionally, PLS offers an integrative modelling approach that enables us to associate all the constructs in a ‘causal’ framework as opposed to the traditional
approach such as regression, which requires all the independent variables to have
direct effect on the dependent variable. Our modelling approach has clearly illustrated that PLS could be a useful tool for researchers interested in studying
entrepreneurship.
Fourth and finally, with few exceptions, previous studies of the entrepreneurial
characteristics associated with venture performance have been based on Western
countries, particularly the USA. In recent years, the generalizability of management theories developed in one culture or nation to other cultures and nations has
been seriously questioned (Hofstede, 1993; Rosenzweig, 1994; Shenkar and Von
Glinow, 1994). Entrepreneurship is a culturally embedded phenomenon. Crosscultural or cross-national generalizations without adequate empirical support are
without any substance. The miraculous economic growth of the Asia Pacific region
is, without doubt, a reflection of the underlying entrepreneurial spirit in the region,
and deserves greater research attention. The present study attempts to bridge this
research gap and is a valuable addition to the scant studies about entrepreneurs
in Singapore.
The research also has some limitations. Because of the nature of our sampling
method, it is impossible to assess how representative the sample is. Additionally,
growth rates may vary across industries, but industry is not treated as a moderating variable. As a result, our findings may be biased towards industries characterized by small and non-high-technology firms. In short, our findings should be
considered tentative.
In conclusion, our research finding that experience is the single factor that has
the greatest effect on venture growth has practical implications for potential entrepreneurs. It is important for them to obtain relevant experience before they start
their own business. The weak effects of personality traits found in this study suggest
that the focus of previous studies on the impact of psychological characteristics
on performance may have been misplaced. A more fruitful research direction
appears to be studying the relationship between an entrepreneur’s skills, experience, learning behaviour, and performance.
