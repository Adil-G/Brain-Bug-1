A BEHAVIORAL DECISION T H E O R Y APPROACH T O MODELING
D Y A D I C T R U S T I N SUPERIORS A N D SUBORDINATES
JOHN K. BUTLER, JR. AND R. STEPHEN CANTRELL
Clemson University
Sammary.-The relative importances of five determinants of dyadic trust
(integrity, competence, consistency, loyalty, and openness) were investigated
from two perspectives: trust in superiors and trust in subordinates. Two experiments were designed from research on behavioral decision theory. The
participants, 78 undergraduate management students, responded to cues that
described hypothetical superiors (Exp. 1) and subordinates (Exp. 2 ) . Responses indicated the amount of trust held in each of 32 superiors and 32
subordinates. Integrity. competence, and consistency were stronger than loyalcy
or openness as determinants of trust in one's superiors and in one's subordinates.
There were no differences in the importance of any of the determinants of
trust i n one's subordinates versus one's superiors. Method considerations are
discussed.
T h e multidimensional nature of crust has been explored clinically by
Jennings (1971) and Gabarro ( 1 9 7 8 ) . T h e dimensions include ( a ) integrity,
honesty and truthfulness; ( b ) competence, technical and interpersonal knowledge and skills required to do one's job; ( c ) consistency, reliability, predictability, and good judgment in handling situations; ( d ) loyalty o r benevolent
motives, willingness to protect and save face for a person; ( e ) openness or
mental accessability, willingness to share ideas and information freely.
This study used the five dimensions of trust, defined above, to establish
experimental conditions in accordance with a behavioral decision theory research approach. This approach, labeled "policy capturing" by Naylor and
Wherry ( 1965), asks participants to make decisions about specific stimuli
or "cues." T h e values of the decisions made by each participant are then
regressed o n the specified values of the cues. T h e importances of the cues,
for a given participant, can b e represented by the standardized beta weights
of the cues in the linear regression equation for that participant (Darlington,
1968; Dawes, 1979; Fountain, 1978; Lane, Murphy, & Marques, 1982; Nystedt
& Murphy, 1979; Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1977; Slovic & Lichtenstein,
1971; Sniezek & Naylor, 1978; Zedeck, 1977). T h e rationale for letting beta
weights represent the importance of cues is that the beta weights indicate the
standardized change in the dependent variable (trust) per unit of standardized
change in each independent variable ( c u e ) .
T h e behavioral decision theory approach has demonstrated some advantages
over other self-report methods. First, the inferred objective weights calculated
by the decision theory method seem to be relatively free from social-desirability

<-----Page 1----->20

response bias (Arnold & Feldman, 1981; Stahl & Harrell, 1982). Socialdesirability response bias is an important consideration when measuring a
construct as potentially sensitive as dyadic trust. Second, the decision theory
approach easily permits wichin-subject analyses, which avoid confounding due
to differences among subjects in the interpretation of items and scales. Withinsubject designs are useful for testing for the relative importance of needs (Stahl
& Harrell, 1982), testing models of motivation (Stahl & Harrell, 1981, 1983),
and clarifying the psychological processes underlying problem solving and
choice (Einhorn & Hagarth, 1981). This paper applies behavioral decision
theory to a new area, interpersonal trust.
The dyadic nature of trust was proposed and operationalized by Larzelere
and Huston (1980). Several other researchers, using different methods, have
found support for the reciprocity of trusting relationships. The methods include the open-ended clinical interview (Gabarro, 1978; Jennings, 1971;
Selrnan, Jaquette, & Lavin, 1977), correlational tests of the results of prisoners
dilemma games (Armstrong & Roback, 1977; Lendenrnann & R a p p o r t , 1980),
and two-stage least-squares-regression tests of nomecursive models (Butler,
1983).
Gabarro ( 1978) found, from interviewing executives, that the dimensions
of trust had different importances according to the relative status of the two
individuals. For a superior's trust in a subordinate, the integrity, competence,
and consistency of the subordinate were most important. For a subordinate's
trust in a superior, the integrity, loyalty (motives), and openness of the
superior were most important. Integrity was most important for both
superiors and subordinates because they felt that, without a perception of
the other's "moral character" and "basic honesty," other dimensions of trust
were meaningless. Subordinates differed from superiors with respect to the
other dimensions, however. Subordinates emphasized the loyalty and openness
of their superiors because superiors held dominance and fate control over
the subordinates. Loyalty was important because subordinates were concerned
about superiors' "motives" and "agendas." subordinates wanted to be sure
that their bosses would let them prove themselves and not conduct "witch
hunts." Openness was important because subordinates wanted their bosses
to "level" with them and "be straight" about problems and information that
might be pertinent either to the superior-subordinate relationships or to the
subordinates' performance.
This study tests, experimentally, seven hypotheses suggested by Gabarro's
interviews. The following hypotheses refer to the relative importance of the
five dimensions in terms of one person's trust for another.
Hypothesis 1: The integrity, loyalty, and openness of one's superiors ate
more important than the superiors' competence and consistency.

Hypothesis 2: The integrity, competence, and consistency of one's subordinates are more important than the subordinates' loyalty and openness.
Hypothesis 3: There is no difference between the importance of the
integrity of one's subordinates and the importance of the integrity of one's
superiors.
Hypothesis 4: The competence of one's subordinates is more important
than the competence of one's superiors.
Hypothesis 5: The consistency of one's subordinates is more important
than the consistency of one's superiors.
Hypothesis 6: The loyalty of one's superiors is more important than the
loyalty of one's subordinates.
Hypothesis 7: The openness of one's superiors is more important than
the openness of one's subordinates.

METHOD
Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, participants made decisions,
on a 5-point scale, about the extent to which they would trust a number of
hypothetical "bosses." This experiment was given two trials with a 2-wk.
interval. The retest, a replication of the first trial, was conducted to assess
the stability over time (test-retest reliability) of the trust scale. In Exp. 2,
conducted 1 wk. after the retest in Exp. 1, participants made trust decisions
about a number of hypothetical "subordinates." So, Exp. 1 dealt with trust
in bosses; Exp. 2 with trust in subordinates.
Ninety-one junior and senior students in an undergraduate course in
management participated for credit in the course. Although the entire sample
included 91 students, 13 were absent for at least one of the three trials. These
13 were excluded from the analysis. Each of the hypothetical "bosses" and
"subordinates" was described by a set of five cues. For each "boss" or "subordinate," the five cues constitute a profile of the five dimensions of trust
(integrity, competence, consistency, loyalty, openness). Fig. 1 shows a sample
"subordinate."
Each of the five cues had two possible values, no or yes (coded 0, l ) ,
resulting in 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 = 32 combinations of orthogonal cues.
There were 32 "bosses" in Exp. 1 and 32 "subordinates" in Exp. 2. Both of
the experiments were preceded by six warm-up decisions, as suggested by
Stahl and Harrell ( 1982 ) , for the purpose of acquainting the decision makers
with the method. Each experiment described 38 "bosses" and 38 "subordinates" but the analyses included only the last 32 "bosses" or "subordinates"
with all combinations of cue descriptors. The "bosses" and "subordinates" were
ordered randomly in both experiments. Each experiment consisted of a z5,
fully-randomized, complete factorial design.
For each of the 78 decision makers, the trust decisions were regressed on

correlation for these regression equations, ( b ) write them into a data set, and
( c ) perform subsequent between-subject analyses o n the beta weights and
SMCs (Butler & Hill, 1984.)
T w o indicators of reliability were examined. First, squared multiple correlations (SMCs) were calculated for each of the decision makers o n each of
the three trials. These values represent the consistency with which each
participant made decisions (Scahl & Harrell, 1981). Second, the test-retest
correlation between the totals of the trust scale items for the two trials of
Exp. 1 was calculated.
W i t h i n each of the three trials, HI and Hg were tested with a one-way
analysis of variance and a Duncan's multiple-range ordering of the beta weights.
Between Exps. 1 and 2, H3 through H7 were tested with t tests contrasting che
corresponding beta weights of the two experiments.

MODELING DYADIC TRUST

Between experiments, the effects of history, maturation, and testing were
plausible threats to validity (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Any of these effects,
particularly testing, could have caused changes in participants between experiments. These rival hypotheses were examined by contrasting corresponding
beta weights between all three pairs of the three trials.

RESULTS
The reliability analyses indicated that the trust scale was reliable and
performed well in capcuring policies concerning the five trust conditions.
The test-retest correlation coefficient was .70. Of the 234 regressions, only
.05). Since the low value

indicates random decisions, this participant was excluded from the study (Stahl
& Harrell, 1981) leaving a between-subjects sample size of 77. The other
squared multiple correlations ranged from .38 to 9 3 , with a mean of .72 for
the first trial of Exp. 1, from .57 to .98 with a mean of .82 for its second trial,
and .52 to .98 with a mean of .76 for Exp. 2. The within-experiment hypotheses,
HI and H? were tested using a one-way analysis of variance to examine differences in the beta weights corresponding to the five trust components in
each of the three trials. Table 1 contains a ranking of the beta-weight means

ments. Table 2 shows the differences between beta-weight means for all pairs
of the three trials, and the t tests of these differences. Three conditions of trust
(integrity, competence, and openness) had significant differences between
the two trials of Exp. 1. These differences suggest that some combination of
history, maturation, and testing effects were operating between the two trials
of Exp. 1. For this reason, the retest trial is probably more relevant than the
first trial of Exp. 1 for testing hypotheses 3 through 7. Tests of the one (retest)-two differences, which were trivial and non-significant support H3 but

The experimental cues apparently provided a reliable manipulation. The
test-retest coefficients, and squared multiple correlations indicate, respectively,
stability of the trust scale over time and consistency of the decision makers
in making their decisions.
Hypothesis 2 was supported. The integrity, competence, and consistency
of subordinates were judged more important than subordinates' loyalty and
openness. However, HI was not supported. Integrity, loyalty, and openness
of superiors were not judged more important than superiors' competence and
consistency. In fact, participants indicated the same relative importance of
the conditions of trust for their hypothetical superiors as they did for their
hypothetical subordinates. In both experiments they ranked the cues from
most to least important: competence > integrity > consistency > loyalty >
openness. According to Duncan's multiple-range test ( p < .05) in both experiments, competence was significantly more important than any of the other
cues. The knowledge and skills of both superiors and subordinates ("ability

<-----Page 6----->MODELING DYADIC TRUST

25

conditions") were more powerful determinants of trust than were the "millingness conditions."
This priority, along with the failure to support HI, is not surprising for
this study. For the past 15 or 16 years, most of the participants had been
students, who probably developed trust in their superiors (teachers) according
to the technical competence of the superiors. Further, only three of the
student-participants had ever worked as supervisors. The other 74 might have
found it difficult to conceive of themselves as having subordinates. Future
research should focus on managers. Trust and mistrust are probably perceived
to be more complex (multidimensional) by practicing managers than by
students who seem to emphasize competence. Still, if a manager desires to
earn the trust of recent graduates, an understanding of the importance of perceived competence for the participants of this study would be useful. A number of researchers have affirmed the strong correlation between favorable
experiences on one's first assignment and future effectiveness (Kotter, 1973;
Schein, 1964).
Hypothesis 3 was supported. There was no significant difference between
the importance of integrity as the participants viewed their superiors vs the
way they viewed their subordinates.
Hypotheses 4, 5, 6, and 7 were not supported. There were no significant
differences in the importance of competence, consistency, loyalty, or openness
in terms of trust in bosses vs trust in subordinates.
The participants in this study disagreed with Gabarro's interviewees.
Reasons for the contradictions would include differences between students and
executives as well as differences in method. As suggested in the rationale
of the disconfirmation of HI, students might find it difficult to project themselves into the role of having hypothetical subordinates. Never having had any
subordinates, they might judge their trust in subordinates the same as they
judge their trust in superiors; but executives might perceive differences in
trust between subordinates and superiors. Future research using a method
similar to one used in this study, with executives as participants, might help
to reduce the threat to external validity, caused by the interaction of selection
and treatment. It would also be illustrative to use Gabarro's interviewing
method on students; but interviews seem to be more useful for generating hypotheses than for testing them.
B
One important difference between data gathered by interviews vs the
decision theory method is susceptibility to social-desirability bias. As mentioned above, subjective weights are more likely to be affected by this bias than
are the inferred objective weights calculated by the decision theory method.
The importance of integrity, loyalty, and openness might have been inflated in
Gabarro's interviews, particularly by the subordinates.

<-----Page 7----->J. K. BUTLER, JR. & R. S. CANTRELL

It is interesting that the difference between Exp. 2 and the first trial of
Exp. 1 (MI-M3 in Table 2 ) would have strongly confirmed I&, nearly confirmed H5,
and strongly confirmed a hypothesis opposite to Hi. These large
differences, the large MI-M2 differences, the trivial M2-M3differences,
and the asymptotic nature of leaning curves suggested that the MI-Mz and
M1-M3differences in Table 2 were caused mostly by testing, a sensitizing effect
of the first trial of Exp. 1. People might have inflated the importance of
trust determinants simply because they participated in Exp. 1. History and
maturation offer additional possible rival hypotheses but not as plausible as
that offered by testing.
The observed pattern of differences was not hypothesized. The two
trials of Exp. 1 were expected to be similar to each other but different from
those in Exp. 2. The comparisons in Table 2 suggest that the changes, which
were probably caused by testing, reached their asymptotes sometime during
the first trial of Exp. 1 or at least before the retest trial of Exp. 1. Therefore,
the M2-M3differences, rather than M1-M3,were assumed, cautiously, to represent trust-in-subordinate vs trust-in-boss differences. A more convincing
method for ruling out the effects of testing would be to conduct one experiment with hypothetical bosses and subordinates randomly interspersed.
Since the trust scale has not been validated extensively, three aspects of
internal validity are discussed. First, face validity is apparent. There is only
one statement (Fig. I ) , repeated 38 times, and used in the analysis 32 times.
It refers directly to the cues, which define personal characteristics. It elicits
a simple response concerning amount of trusc in a boss or subordinate.
Second, the experiments derive construct validity from behavioral decision
theory from which they were designed. Construct validity of the experiments
depends on the t r u h of three assumptions. The first is that the cues were
effective experimental manipulators. The second assumption is that participants underscood the statement, "With the above personal characteristics in
mind, indicace how much you would trzcst this boss (subordinate)." The third
assumption is that participants responded conscientiously and truthfully to the
statement. Strong evidence in favor of these three assumptions comes from
the high consistency of decision making for all but one of the participants in
one of the trials. Although consistency certainly does not ensure validity, it
is difficult to imagine how such consistency could have been achieved if any
of the three assumptions were false.
Third, content validity was assessed with a manipulation check. Afcer
the second experiment, all of the participants were asked to write a few
sentences answering the following questions. (1) "What procedures did you
use to make your decisions in the Research Questionnaire? In other words,
for each of the hypothetical subordinates, how did you go about choosing one

<-----Page 8----->MODELING DYADIC TRUST

27

of the responses (A, B, C, D, or E)?" and ( 2 ) "What did your responses
(A, B, C, D, or E) mean?"
Content analysis of the answers to these questions indicated that the cues
had been effective manipulators and that every one of the participants had
understood the trust statement i n the way it was intended.
T h e understanding of interpersonal trust warrants more scrutiny. T h e
motivational aspects of trust and mistrust are not well understood. Research
is needed t o determine whether the dominance of power is a n outcome caused
by mistrust. Trust seems to relate to intrinsic motivation; mistrust and power
to extrinsic motivation. There is evidence that trustworthiness and the perceived need for power are negatively correlated (Butler, 1983; Christie &
Merton, 1958; Frost, Stimpson, & Maughan, 1 9 7 8 ) . Behavioral decision theory
approaches can be used in clarifying the psychological processes that underlie
trust feelings and their consequences i n different organizational climates (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981; Einhorn, Kleinmuntz, & Kleinmuntz, 1979).
