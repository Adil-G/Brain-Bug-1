Quality, Validation, and Trust

Knowledge production in entrepreneurship requires inclusivity as well as diversity and pluralism in
research perspectives and approaches. In this article, the authors address concerns about
interpretivist research regarding validity, reliability, objectivity, generalizability, and
communicability of results that militate against its more widespread acceptance. Following the
nonfoundationalist argument that all observation is theory-laden, context specific, and that there are
no external criteria against which to assess research design and execution and the data produced,
the authors propose that quality must be internalized within the underlying research philosophy
rather than something to be tested upon completion. This requires a shift from the notion of validity
as an outcome to validation as a process. To elucidate this, they provide a guiding framework and
present a case illustration that will assist an interpretivist entrepreneurship researcher to establish
and demonstrate the quality of their work.

Introduction
Although entrepreneurship has developed substantially over the past 25 years (Cornelius,
Landström, & Persson, 2006), it remains a field still seeking legitimacy (Bruyat & Julian,
2001; Busenitz et al., 2003). A contributing factor is the breadth of the field, reflected in the
recently agreed domain statement of the Entrepreneurship Division of the Academy of
Management (Academy of Management, 2007). This defines entrepreneurship as, ‘‘the creation and management of new businesses, small businesses and family businesses, and the
characteristics and special problems of entrepreneurs.’’ While this definition is permissive,
allowing researchers to investigate entrepreneurship in a manner that fits their interests
(Brush, Manolova, & Edelman, 2008; Davidsson, Low, & Wright, 2001), some authors

caution that it also dissipates the focus of entrepreneurship research into a fragmented
potpourri (Gartner, 2001; Harrison & Leitch, 1996) that is constraining both the field’s
scholarly development and its credibility as an academic discipline (Grégoire, Noël, Déry,
& Béchard, 2006).
Accordingly, some scholars call for convergence, the ‘‘linear accumulation of knowledge which comes from a widely shared ‘paradigm’, i.e., a set of assumptions about a field’s
object of study, method of investigation, explanatory model, and overall interpretation
scheme’’ (Grégoire et al., 2006, p. 334). This derives from the belief that ‘‘as an intellectual
field matures, it becomes increasingly characterized by a set of codified theories, models,
methods, and/or measures – which are to direct ongoing research’’ (Grégoire et al., 2006, p.
335). Moreover, they believe that in entrepreneurship this will be achieved through the systematic adoption of a research paradigm characterized by a commitment to theory building
and testing in a hypothetico-deductive framework using quantitative methods to analyze
large data sets and establish generalizable findings (Davidsson, 2003). This hegemonic,
objectivist view necessitates, among other things, agreement on methods and techniques
and is problematic for two main reasons. First, it makes the assumption that all disciplines
should evolve according to the Kuhnian paradigmatic pattern of ‘‘normal’’ science. However, this appears to ignore Kuhn’s own belief that the human sciences (as he termed them)
have not yet reached the stage where there is a dominant paradigm within which normal
science progresses (Kuhn, 1996). Second, the argument for convergence in entrepreneurship research is predicated on a belief that it is a discipline in which knowledge is constituted as it is in the natural sciences. Yet, entrepreneurship is a multifaceted, complex social
construct that is enacted in many different contexts by a variety of actors. Therefore, we
propose that the production of rich, in-depth knowledge requires researchers to adopt
diverse ontological and epistemological positions, as well as draw on a range of theoretical
and practice traditions from both the social sciences and the humanities (Easterby-Smith,
Golden-Biddle, & Locke, 2008; Gephart, 2004).
Consequently, in relation to advancing the field, instead of convergence, which limits the
types of questions that can be addressed, we argue for inclusivity, diversity, and pluralism in
research perspectives and approaches. This is not to suggest that ‘‘anything goes.’’ On the
contrary, to develop knowledge and understanding of entrepreneurship all research, positivist and interpretivist, must be robust and characterized by integrity and trustworthiness.
The means of achieving and assessing such characteristics are well established and documented for positivist research. However, the central issues addressed in this article are, how
can interpretivist entrepreneurship research be undertaken in a manner that creates knowledge equal in validity to that of objectivist social science and how can this equivalence
become recognized and accepted in the entrepreneurship domain?
Where possible, we use the term ‘‘interpretivist’’ to describe nonpositivist research concerned with the investigation of social reality (Stahl, 2007). Furthermore, we adopt a methodological perspective, that is, we are concerned with ‘‘the theory of how research should be
undertaken including the theoretical and philosophical assumptions upon which research is
based and the implications of these for the method or methods adopted’’ (Saunders, Lewis,
& Thornhill, 2007, p. 602). Thus, except where used by others, we have avoided the term
‘‘qualitative’’ research which in entrepreneurship tends merely to refer to methods, that is, procedures, and techniques used to obtain and analyze research data.

The remainder of this article discusses ontology, epistemology, and methodology in
entrepreneurship research. It examines the issue of research quality and discusses it in the
context of both positivism and interpretivism. We propose validation as a process for establishing and assessing the quality of interpretivist entrepreneurship research. Finally, we
present a guiding framework and draw on a case example by way of explication.

Ontology and Epistemology in Entrepreneurship Research
The early tendency toward positivism in the management disciplines was reinforced in
the first decades of the 20th century by the influence of economics, sociology, and psychology on their evolution. As a result, both in management research generally and in entrepreneurship research particularly, it was believed to be possible to lay claims to the natural
sciences’ perceived virtues of rationality, universality, objectivity, and value-free knowledge. Thus, calls in entrepreneurship for more objectivist research (such as Davidsson,
2003), follow what currently constitutes a mainstream approach in the social sciences
‘‘of (unthinkingly) adopting methods assumed to be successfully utilized in the natural
sciences or somehow thought, on an a priori basis, to characterize proper science’’ (Lawson,
2008, p. 443). In consequence, researchers in entrepreneurship tend to be more concerned
with the definition of their object of study (e.g., new venture creation, opportunity recognition, entrepreneurial cognition, venture capital, growth) and the choice of data collection
protocols (secondary data analysis, survey research, interpretivist case studies, and so on)
than with the philosophical assumptions that underlie their work. Yet, in entrepreneurship,
management and other realms of social inquiry research should emanate from beliefs about
what constitutes an understanding and explanation of a social phenomenon (Keat & Urry,
1982). ‘‘The relationship between data and theory is an issue that has been hotly debated by
philosophers for many centuries. Failure to think through philosophical issues such as these,
while not necessarily fatal, can seriously affect the quality of management research, and
they are central to the notion of research design’’ (Easterby-Smith, Thorpe, & Jackson,
2008, p. 56). Therefore, undertaking credible social research requires that the questions
asked and the designs employed are shaped by the researcher’s underlying ontological and
epistemological assumptions.
Thus, questions confronting researchers include the following: should explanations of
the social world be deduced from observable facts? (the empiricist or positivist position);
should they be grounded in people’s self-understandings? (the interpretivist position); or
should they be based on whatever enables us to change the state of affairs in the world?
(which reflects both an instrumentalist position and a deductivist position based on the generation of effectively predictive theories) (Shapiro & Wendt, 2005). There can be no simple
answers to these questions given the complexity of the social world and the ontological differences between positivism and interpretivism. On the one hand, positivism is based on a
realist ontology which assumes that observation is theory neutral and that the role of scientific research is to identify law-like generalizations that account for what was observed. On
the other hand, interpretivism is based on a life-world ontology which argues that all observation is theory- and value-laden and that investigation of the social world is not, and cannot
be, the pursuit of detached objective truth.

The adoption of an interpretivist approach to knowledge creation (Bernstein, 1995) is
predicated on the argument that there can be no understanding of the social world without
interpretation (Johnson, 1987). In other words, in the social sciences, interpretivist research
represents a move away from erklären, the deterministic explanation of human behavior by
establishing causal relationships between variables. Rather, it is concerned with verstehen,
the understanding of human behavior which entails, ‘‘capturing the actual meanings and
interpretations that actors subjectively ascribe to phenomena in order to describe and
explain their behaviour’’ (Johnson, Buehring, Cassell, & Symon, 2006, p. 132). Interpretivist inquiry, therefore, attempts to embrace the complex and dynamic quality of the social
world and allows the researcher to view a social research problem holistically, get close to
participants, enter their realities, and interpret their perceptions as appropriate (Bogdan &
Taylor, 1975; Hoepfl, 1997; Shaw, 1999). This is achieved by generating thick and rich
descriptions of actual events in real-life contexts that uncover and preserve the meanings
that those involved ascribe to them (Gephart, 2004).
If we view an academic discipline as a community of scholars (Harrison & Leitch, 1996),
then the challenge is for those scholars to bring together insights from multiple disciplines
to investigate a set of phenomena that are ‘‘neither so broad as to defy the notion of intellectual community, nor so narrow we lose sight of our goal’’ (Davidsson et al., 2001, p. 7).

Methodology in Entrepreneurship Research
Social objects are realized through the descriptions, classifications, or explanations of the
disciplines of social inquiry. Establishing the credibility of these descriptions, classifications, or explanations ‘‘entails finding out what procedures (theoretical, practical) are used
to produce [them]. This should allow us to say that the objects so described, classified or
explained are at least partly ‘constructed’, or produced by, those procedures themselves’’
(Montuschi, 2003, p. 118). Thus, in empirical social science research objectivity may not
be used as a measure of credibility because, ‘‘talking of objectivity only makes sense in the
concrete context of an assessment of a described objective inquiry’’ (Montuschi, 2003, p.
119).
Law (2004) has recently taken these issues further: in the development of an ‘‘ontological
methodology’’ (Law, 2004, p. 154), the procedural issue is how to conduct social research
studies well; that is, how do we reflect and enact particular commitments, such as, to truth,
politics or elegance, in an investigation? What does it mean, for example, to investigate well
the experience of enacting entrepreneurial intentions? (Krueger, Reilly, & Carsrud, 2000);
to ask the ‘‘why?’’ and ‘‘how?’’ and ‘‘how was the experience?’’ type questions? Such questions lead to considerations that are broader yet more constrained than traditional questions
of methodology. They are broader, in that the concern is not just to ‘‘make truths’’ but to ask
what other realities are being made manifest in the conduct of the research (what does it
mean, the ‘‘why’’?—in other words, what is the reflexive practice of the researcher in a
search for meaning grounded in research participants’ experiences?). They are constrained,
because the outcome of these methodologies is to arrive at particular conclusions in particular locations for particular studies. Instead of there being general rules and universal methodologies (the Holy Grail of the positivist project), ‘‘there are only specific and enacted

71

overlaps between provisionally congealed realities that have to be crafted in a way that
responds to and produces [the] particular . . . we are left with situated enactments and sets
of partial connections, and it is to those that we owe our heterogeneous responsibilities’’
(Law, 2004, p. 155).
In relation to entrepreneurship Bygrave (2007) argues that its status is a practical professional discipline in which the fundamental questions are, ‘‘what should entrepreneurs do?’’
and ‘‘how can we improve entrepreneurial practice?’’ Such questions raise the issue of the
nature of the entrepreneurship discipline and the implications for choice of methodology:
In our craving for the respect of our academic colleagues we are squandering the opportunity to
build a new paradigm with imaginative research methods that are appropriate to a profession
instead of a pure science . . . we [should] keep our eyes on improving the practice of entrepreneurship (Bygrave, 2007, p. 25, 27).

In other words, the status of entrepreneurship as a practice-based discipline (Gherardi,
2006; Schatzki, 2001) suggests that its knowledge is bounded by its contextual nature.
Thus, from both the philosophy of science argument and the debate over the nature of
entrepreneurship as a discipline, there are implications for choice of methodology in the
field. Specifically, the adoption of interpretivist methodologies is a necessary reflection
of both the nature of the objects of study and the types of questions to be asked. Indeed,
Gartner and Birley (2002) propose that many important entrepreneurship questions can only
be asked (and answered) through the use of such approaches and methods. They are careful
though, not to enter a debate on whether such research is more ‘‘truthful’’ than positivist
research; rather, they argue that the use of both approaches by entrepreneurship researchers
is likely to mean that a wider range of questions may be addressed.
The implication of this is that choice of methodology becomes a matter of aptness: different types of research question are best answered by different types of study employing
appropriate methods. The challenge for entrepreneurship research is not to reject traditional
methodologies—the so-called standard, often quantitative, research methodologies that
have been instrumentally effective in a number of domains. Rather, it is to recognize that
the traditional approach is ‘‘badly adapted to the study of the ephemeral, the indefinite and
the irregular’’ (Law, 2004, p. 4)—the very characteristics of entrepreneurship research that
have been held to justify the adoption of interpretivist type methodologies (Neergaard &
Ulhøi, 2007). This reinforces the call for diversity and pluralism in entrepreneurship
research: ‘‘ . . . the breadth and richness of understanding is surely enhanced by acceptance
of the need for pluralism’’ (Jennings, Perren, & Carter, 2005, p.148).

Quality in Interpretivist Entrepreneurship Research
As indicated in the Introduction, a pragmatic challenge for interpretivist researchers in
entrepreneurship is to determine the appropriate criteria for evaluating and signaling the
quality of that research. In the discussion that follows, we employ ‘‘quality’’ as an umbrella
term to encompass notions of truthfulness, integrity, rigor, robustness, and aptness. First, we
compare and contrast positivist and interpretivist approaches to establishing and assessing

<-----Page 6----->72 Organizational Research Methods

research quality. Next, we draw on a particular study to illustrate the process of validation,
not to suggest replication of our practices. We recognize that the research process in any
particular study is contextually unique as an investigation into particular social realities and,
as such, cannot be readily generalized.

Positivist and Interpretivist Approaches to Quality
In the context of entrepreneurship, though it has not been explicitly articulated, quality
underlies the debate over the employment of interpretivist methodologies. The generally
low adoption of, and regard given to, such research in entrepreneurship has been attributed
primarily to a perceived lack of methodological rigor and attention to detail in those studies
which have been undertaken (Gartner & Birley, 2002; Neergaard & Ulhøi, 2007). It is, of
course, possible that interpretivist studies in entrepreneurship are of intrinsically poor quality (although the definition and indicators of quality remain matters for debate (EasterbySmith, Golden-Biddle, et al., 2008)). Equally, Gephart (2004) and Locke (2001) have suggested that researchers may have undertaken robust interpretivist research but failed to
describe the research process in sufficient detail. We propose that the debate over quality
in interpretivist entrepreneurship research has been founded on the assumed appropriateness of positivist approaches. We argue here for a perspective associated with nonfoundationalist research, which proposes that the issue of quality can only be addressed by viewing
it as intrinsic to the research design, that is, it is internalized within the underlying research
philosophy and orientation (Amis & Silk, 2008).
Despite calls for the adoption of more qualitative approaches in entrepreneurship
research (Gartner & Birley, 2002; Hindle, 2004; Neergaard & Ulhøi, 2007), and their widespread acceptance across the social sciences (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005), many researchers,
reviewers, and editors still favor positivist research (Easterby-Smith, Golden-Biddle, et al.,
2008; Pratt, 2008). This reflects the fact that the traditional and still dominant method of
assessing quality in research is the theory-driven approach central to the ‘‘scientific
method.’’ Such an approach relies on a commitment to the objective discovery of the truth
underlying the relations among variables, by means of research that is characterized by the
traditional criteria of internal and external validity, reliability, objectivity, and generalizability (Amis & Silk, 2008). Thus, it is easier for quantitative researchers to provide indicators of rigor by presenting a relatively straightforward, transparent methodological
account within a standardized set of procedures. For the interpretivist researcher however,
the task of demonstrating methodological rigor is made much more difficult and complex
by the range, variety, and richness of the methodological approaches available to them.
Van Maanen (1979) has argued that it is necessary to reclaim interpretivist methods for
organizational research to portray more closely ‘‘the meaning, not the frequency, of certain
more or less naturally occurring phenomena in the social world’’ (p. 539). Moreover, Amis
and Silk (2008) contend that ‘‘traditional and still dominant methods of assessing research
quality, founded on a positivistic understanding of the social world, are inherently unsuited
to producing the variety of scholarship necessary for a vital, dynamic organizational studies’’
(p. 456). This issue has been identified as a potential constraint on the development of the
field of entrepreneurship specifically. Indeed, Hindle (2004, p. 577) cautions that, ‘‘Unless
entrepreneurship . . . begin[s] to embrace higher volumes of higher caliber qualitative

<-----Page 7----->Leitch et al. / Interpretivist Research in Entrepreneurship

73

research, the relevance and potency of the entrepreneurial canon will be severely compromised by a lack of the methodological variety that is so strongly displayed in other social
sciences’’.
In relation to research quality, Amis and Silk (2008, p. 457) state that it is not ‘‘something
to be tested at the completion of the research or an outcome of the application of methods’’
(p. 458). Instead they argue that it is inseparable from the ontological and epistemological
foundations on which a particular study is based. In support of their argument they discuss
three different research orientations namely, foundationalism, quasifoundationalism, and
nonfoundationalism and the respective interpretations of quality associated with them. The
nonfoundationalist position is the furthest removed from positivism and its associated
assumptions of quality. Nonfoundationalist researchers believe that moral concerns are central to the purpose and quality of research, so there is no possibility of uncovering any neutral social facts and that all knowledge is value-laden. ‘‘Thus there can be no hypotheses to
be tested, proven, disproven, or retested as there are no objective facts to uncover’’ (p. 457).
Furthermore, from this perspective issues of quality are inherent in the underlying intent of
the research based on a ‘‘moral ethic’’ in organizational theory that is less concerned with
understanding how to design more efficient organizations than with who controls them and
the consequences of that control (Amis & Silk, 2008, p. 458; Bartunek, 2002; Clegg, 2002;
Hinings & Greenwood, 2002).
Regarding how quality in interpretivist entrepreneurship research can be established and
assessed, a critical issue to be borne in mind is the aim of such research. As Cope (2005)
reminds us, ontologically no assumptions are made about what is and is not real—descriptions of phenomena begin with people’s experiences of them. Thus, the purpose of interpretivist research is not to confirm or disconfirm prior theories, ‘‘but to develop ‘bottom-up’
interpretive theories that are inextricably ‘grounded’ in the lived-world’’ (Cope, 2005, p.
167). Consequently, quality permeates the entire research process that involves not only
a sound understanding of its ontological and epistemological underpinnings and research
design, but also experience and skill in the use of data gathering and analysis techniques.
More specifically, it entails ‘‘carefully and thoroughly capturing and describing how people
experience some phenomenon—how they perceive it, describe it, feel it, remember it, make
sense of it and talk about it with others’’ (Patton, 1990, p. 104). In addition, this has to be
carefully recorded yet, as Gephart (2004, p. 458) notes, researchers often fail to describe the
research process in sufficient detail and to articulate ‘‘how research practices transform
observations into data, results, findings and insights’’. Therefore, interpretivist researchers
in entrepreneurship, as in other social science domains, must appreciate that it is their
responsibility to provide the reader with sufficient information on the design and conduct
of their research so that she or he may assess the integrity and rigor of the research process.
In light of the above, the issue of validity must be reconsidered. Angen (2000, p. 387) has
suggested that new configurations of validity depend on qualities inherent in the researcher
and the research process and uses the term ‘‘validation’’ rather than ‘‘validity’’ to emphasize
how ‘‘a judgement of the trustworthiness or goodness of a piece of research is a continuous
process occurring within a community of researchers . . . Maintaining an antifoundationalist stance on epistemology implies the need for an ongoing open dialogue on the topic of
what makes interpretive research worthy of our trust’’ (Angen, 2000, p. 387; Lather,
1993; Mischler, 1990).

<-----Page 8----->74 Organizational Research Methods

This process of validation comprises three elements. First, as value-free science is considered an impossibility (Smith, 1990), ethical validation of any interpretivist research
study encompasses the moral stance of the researchers (Fiumar, 1990) and is reflected in
the focus on understanding meanings in everyday existence and on supporting the development of self-awareness in the research participants. It requires that we provide ‘‘practical,
generative, possibly transformative, and hopefully nondogmatic answers to the questions
we pose as researchers’’ (Angen, 2000 p. 389; Van Manen, 1990). Unger (1992) suggests
that the ethical validation of an investigation should involve asking if it is helpful to the
target population, whether alternative explanations to those articulated are presented, and
if we are aware of, or are more enlightened about, the human condition because of it. Second, given that methods per se cannot be the basis for establishing validity in interpretivist
research, validation arises from the substance of the inquiry. Accordingly, the substantive
validation of a piece of research must be thought through carefully from the inception of the
study to the completion of the research process. Creswell (1998, p. 16) observes that such
research occurs in a natural setting; the researcher is the key instrument of data collection;
data are collected as words through interviewing, participant observation, and/or qualitative
open-ended questions; analysis is done inductively; and the focus is on participants’ perspectives. Substantive validation includes the researcher assessing their biases at an earlier
stage of the process, reflecting on how these are changed through engagement with the
research topic and context, and documenting all this in the final output (Angen, 2000; Bergum, 1991). Accounts of interpretivist research should, therefore, provide compelling, powerful, and convincing evidence for the intended audience (Smith, 1990; Van Manen, 1990).
Third, the validation of such research fundamentally depends on researcher quality (Angen,
2000), and it is the responsibility of the researcher to develop a valid interpretation of their
research topic because ‘‘we have a human moral obligation to take up topics of principal
value; and we must do everything in our power to do them justice’’ (Angen, 2000, p. 391).
These elements encompass the distinctively interpretivist emphasis on the signaling of
openness to emergent issues, the paying of attention to negative and deviant (outlier) cases,
the separation of evidence and interpretation, the communication of transparency and
reflexivity in the methods used, the adoption of an approach which is both faithful to, and
critical of, the data, and the exploration of the possible relevance or utility to interest groups
(Easterby-Smith, Golden-Biddle, et al., 2008). These three elements of validation also have
implications for the three domains of the research process namely, research design and data
collection, data analysis, and interpretation. In these domains the researcher explains the
aim and rationale for the research, sets this in the context of prior knowledge of the topic,
justifies the choice of interpretivist methods as the most appropriate, explains the research
process in terms of case selection, gaining access and data recording, sets out the process of
data analysis, and clearly identifies the implications of the findings (Easterby-Smith,
Golden-Biddle, et al., 2008; Seale, 2004).
To illustrate the implications of this shift from validity as an outcome, that is, something
supported by sound and convincing evidence, to validation as the process of confirmation,
we provide a guiding framework that will allow an interpretivist researcher to establish and
demonstrate the trustworthiness of their methodological approach (Table 1). In addition, we
draw on a case illustration based on one of our own interpretivist research projects.
Although we argue that trustworthiness requires the clear and coherent signaling of

validation at all stages of the research process, we recognize that context matters and the
detailed articulation of the validation of any particular qualitative research study will necessarily be unique to itself.

Research Design and Data Collection
The study which we draw on is an investigation of women’s perceptions of the experience of raising external finance for the start-up and growth of their businesses (some
early empirical results, but not the broader methodological issues we discuss here, have
been presented in Hill, Leitch, and Harrison, 2006). As women business owners are not a
homogeneous group, and it is no longer appropriate to identify ‘‘the male’’ as the benchmark against which female entrepreneurship is judged (Ahl, 2004, 2006; Carter & Brush,
2004), the research was designed to encapsulate their heterogeneity as well as their context in terms of time and space. To capture the complicated and dynamic nature of the
process of seeking and obtaining finance, interpretivist analysis was required to give
‘‘voice’’ to women’s experiences in their own right as an underrepresented and underresearched group in entrepreneurship. We chose as our data collection method in-depth
interviews with people who had ‘‘directly experienced the phenomenon of interest’’
(Patton, 1990, p. 104). Specifically, we used the qualitative version of the critical incident interview technique (CIT) (Chell, 2004) to evoke the full complexity of accessing
finance, to allow for reflexivity and self-critical reflection as we engaged with the participants, and for the emergence of disconfirming cases (Butterfield, Borgen, Amundsen,
& Maglio, 2005; Chell, 1998, 2004; Flanagan, 1954). Although the use of CIT in entrepreneurship research has been relatively limited (Harrison & Mason, 2004), we consider
that in this study its use was fully consistent with a nonfoundationalist perspective
that considers quality in research as relational (Lincoln, 1995), grounded in the sharing
of experience between the researchers and the participants in the research (Amis &
Silk, 2008).
During the interviews, participants were asked to recall specific events from their personal perspectives and in their own words (Stauss & Weinlich, 1997), which gave them
‘‘voice.’’ This permitted ‘‘self-defined criticality’’ where the focus was on participants’
‘‘personal representation of salient moments’’ (Cope, 2003, p. 436; Cope and Watts,
2000, p. 112), thereby yielding ‘‘understanding of the incident from the perspective of the
individual, taking into account cognitive, affective and behavioural elements’’ (Chell, 1998,
p. 56). Our use of CIT in this manner enabled the creation of detailed records of events
(Grove & Fisk, 1997) and a rich set of data (Gabbott & Hogg, 1996), which facilitated the
development of depth and thoroughness in understanding.
Cope (2005, p. 176) points out that, in designing such interviews, which should allow the
course of the dialogue to be largely set by the participants (Thompson, Locander, & Pollio,
1989), researchers have to find a comfortable and achievable balance between preunderstanding (structure) and unbiased openness toward the phenomenon under study. Therefore,
it is the participants who define what constitutes both an incident and, in this case, the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of their encounters with actual or potential providers of finance
in the context of their own realities.

Analysis
Basit (2003, p. 143) describes the analysis of qualitative data as being a difficult,
dynamic, intuitive, and creative process, the aim of which is to determine the assumptions,
categories, and relationships that inform respondents’ views of the world in general and of
the issue under investigation in particular (McCracken, 1988). This involves ‘‘working with
data, organizing it, breaking it into manageable units, synthesising it, searching for patterns,
discovering what is important and what is to be learned, and deciding what you will tell
others’’ (Bogdan & Biklen, 1982, p. 145). It allows research findings to be drawn from the
dominant or significant themes teased from the raw data without the constraints of more
structured methodologies (Thomas, 2003). The primary goal is to generate understanding
of the participants’ sense making in the research situation.
Our analysis involved close reading and re-reading of the texts (the interview transcripts)
and proceeded in three stages. First, to create descriptive categories that represented a preliminary framework for analysis, we identified a number of broad categories or themes
through a process of open coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). We began with a ‘‘start list’’
(Miles & Huberman, 1994) of 13 preliminary codes or categories derived from the structure
of the critical incident interview that had been informed by both our own prior understanding of the research topic and by popular and personal understandings of the issue. Second,
we broke the raw data down into manageable ‘‘bits’’ (Dye, Schatz, Rosenberg, & Coleman,
2000), coded these bits, and assigned to temporary categories those data bits that apparently
related to the same context. In doing so, we made a series of judgments based both on our
own personal interaction with the data and with each other as researchers and on our commitment to give voice to the participants at all stages of the process.
To facilitate the separation of the perceptions and experiences of the research participants from our own perceptions of those perceptions and experiences in the analysis, we
adopted the following procedure. The nine transcripts were scrutinized by two of us, each
of whom independently coded the texts on a paragraph by paragraph basis. Following Ryan
& Bernard (2003) we ‘‘pawed’’ the text, which involved highlighting key phrases because
they appeared to make some kind of sense (Sandelowski, 1995). Third, through a process of
‘‘axial coding’’ (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) we revised and refined the start list of categories,
created subcategories and determined how the categories related to each other. This process
of constant comparison of the codes and categories emerging from the analysis was accompanied by comparison with subsequent data collected and with concepts outlined in the literature (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). By comparing and combining categories in new ways, we
sought not merely to describe, but to develop new insights into the phenomenon of interest
(Hoepfl, 1997). Thus, it is possible to signal in the written account of a research project, the
personal involvement of the researchers in the process of analysis, the nature of the
researchers’ work, the transformation in their understanding, and their thoughtfulness and
care in the choice of method and analysis (Kvale, 1996; Mischler, 1990).

Interpretation
In interpreting the outcomes of the analysis, our purpose was to create a small number of
summary categories that we considered captured the key themes in the raw data judged to

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 13----->Leitch et al. / Interpretivist Research in Entrepreneurship

79

be the most important in terms of the research objectives (Thomas, 2003). The aim of the
process was to organize and structure the outcomes of the analysis according to the issues
and topics identified by research participants as being important in understanding the phenomenon of interest (Shaw, 1999), a grounded understanding, ‘‘derived from the concepts
and categories which social actors use to interpret and understand their worlds’’ (Jones,
1985, p. 25).
In signaling the validation of the interpretation of the outcomes of the analysis, it is
important to recognize both the generative potential of the research, in terms of opening
new questions and possibilities (Peshkin, 1993), and the scope for transforming actions,
based on a cooperative approach between the researcher and the participants—as illustrated
by our study. The process of theme identification may also involve discovery of themes
missing from the text, that is, what participants do not mention—contrary perhaps to what
intuition and/or prior research and experience would suggest they might. In this study, one
such missing theme was ‘‘the deal,’’ yet intuitively one might have expected the nature of
the deal struck between applicants for, and suppliers of, finance to have influenced participants’ perceptions of the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of such encounters. Data analysis
revealed that participants appeared to be influenced less by the substance of the deal and
more by their perceptions and evaluations of the interactions between themselves and the
actual/potential suppliers of finance. This finding raises issues for further research and has
practical implications in terms of the self-reflexive behavior of both women business owners and financial institutions and intermediaries. Moreover, it allows the researchers to
clearly evidence that the research addresses issues of practical relevance through design,
analysis, and interpretation, and thereby passes the ‘‘so what?’’ test.
Using the guidance set out in Table 1, interpretivist researchers are able to highlight the
validation of their research in a way that is consistent with both their own intentions as
researchers and the situations and expectations of the participants. However, none of these
signals will be effective if the researcher herself does not describe her own skills and personal qualities (Morse, 1994). These comprise possession of good interpersonal skills
including resilience, patience, persistence in the face of ambiguity and setbacks, versatility,
and flexibility and meticulousness in carrying out the research, which can be revealed by
clearly articulating what was done and how it was done at all stages of the research process.
In addition, the creation of intersubjective understanding within both the community of
researchers and the community of the researched, the ability to communicate persuasively
(to use rhetoric, in the Aristotelian sense (McCloskey, 2008)) is paramount. If interpretivist
research in entrepreneurship is to meet the required standards of validation, then its practitioners must be accomplished craft workers (Kvale, 1996; Mischler, 1990), learning the
skills of interpretivist research through exemplars, experiential training, and practice.

Conclusion
As entrepreneurship is a multifaceted, complex social construct, we have contended that
knowledge production requires inclusivity, diversity, and pluralism in research perspectives
and approaches. Furthermore, we believe that to develop knowledge and understanding, all
such research must be robust and characterized by integrity and trustworthiness. However,

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 14----->80 Organizational Research Methods

in relation to interpretivist research, quality has been a problematic issue partly because of
the assumed appropriateness of applying positivist criteria to its assessment and also
because there are relatively few examples of thorough, rigorous, and robust studies. In this
article, we have responded to recent calls for more and better interpretivist research in entrepreneurship by elaborating the justification for, and the procedures to be followed in, conducting such research. We have demonstrated that with due care and attention, interpretivist
entrepreneurship research is capable of producing rich data through which respondents’
experiences, perceptions, and beliefs may be accessed, thus adding significantly to the
understanding of entrepreneurial behavior.
Our discussion has also been set within an argument that the real issue in advancing the
field of entrepreneurship is more to do with determining the questions to be asked (methodology) than with debating the methods (techniques) used to answer those questions. Thus,
a key issue is not selecting between qualitative and quantitative research techniques, but the
more fundamental choice between interpretivist and positivist methodological perspectives.
We have followed the nonfoundationalist argument that all observation is theory-laden and
context specific, and in consequence there are no external reference points against which to
compare research design, research execution, and the data produced. Accordingly, the issue
of quality can only be addressed by considering it to be intrinsic to the research design.
Therefore, ‘‘it becomes internalized within the underlying research philosophy and orientation rather than being something to be ‘tested’ at the completion . . . or during . . . the
research’’ (Amis & Silk, 2008, p. 466).
Our focus has deliberately been on the articulation of the issues involved in establishing
and demonstrating the validation of interpretivist entrepreneurship research. We conclude
that quality has to be established, not through some ex-post assessment of the truthfulness of
the research findings, but intrinsically through the ethical and substantive validation of the
design and execution of the research by skilled and capable researchers. In this way, we
have progressed the debate concerning the contribution that interpretivist entrepreneurship
research can make to the development of the field.
