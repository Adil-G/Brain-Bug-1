SUMMARY

Universiq

Research examining predictors of new firm performance is clearly of
interest to entrepreneurs and to those who provide advice and finds for
their ventures. A growing body of research has examined the influence upon
performance of such variables as entrepreneurs’ characteristics, processes of founding, venture attributes, and env~ro~enta~ characteristics.
however, considered as a whole, this research has shown mixed results

and limited~~ings
to date.
This paper considers some of the challenges that arise in attempting IO predict new firm
performance. A key factor is the heavy dependence of new ventures upon environmental developments,
many of which may be very dificult to predict. All firms are impacted by the environment, but new
ventures have a concentration of risk upon a few products or services, narrow markets, and a few key
resources. Thus, well-conceived ventures can fail because of unforeseen environmental shocks and the
lack of “deep pockets” to ride out hard times. These same factors can cause new firm performance to
swing widely, confounding attempts to identify predictors of good or poor performance.
There are also challenges because many entrepreneurs pursue personal goals, some of which are
noneconomic in nature. Thus,decisions about whether IOfound ventures, about how vigorously to grow
them, or about whether or not to close down marginal businesses are all influenced by the personal
values of entrepreneurs.
The diversity of ventures, encompassing firms that di$er greatly in scale and potential,
complicates the task of dete~ining
predictors of performance. It may be that the influence of a
particular variable, such as management experience, varies by type of venture. Previous research has
also used a variety of performance measures, making comparisons across studies more dificult. Little
has been done to determine whether the factors that enhance one measure of performance, such as
survival, are the same as those that lead to others, such as growth or profitability.
Previous research has been hampered by inadequate theoretical frameworks and, in some cases, by

inappropriate methods of analysis. In additionpast research often could have been characterized by a
tendency to examine variables that were easy to study, rather than those that were important.
Despite limited success to date, we should not forsake research on predictors of new venture
performance. The challenges discussed probably put limits on our ability to predict performance of
individual ventures. However, the field of study is young and there is much that can be done to add to
our understanding. The paper then develops recommendations for future research, noting that each of
the challenges considered raises specific research opportunities.

INTRODUCTION
One of the central questions in entrepreneurship
is why some new firms succeed and others
fail. If we can determine what factors influence new firm performance, this has implications
for prospective entrepreneurs,
as well as their advisors and investors. If certain factors
increase the probability
of success, then entrepreneurs
can appraise their ventures
accordingly, possibly modifying their plans or deciding not to start at that time.
Thus a number of reviews of the field have called for attention to the cues distinguishing
start-up firms with high-growth potential from those with low-growth potential (Bull 1991),
the development of causal models of new venture performance (Low and MacMillan 1988;
VanderWerf 1989), and increased understanding of the conditions that promote new venture
survival and success (Kalleberg and Leicht 1991).
This paper examines some of the challenges in trying to predict new firm performance.
Some of these problems may require care and systematic attention in conducting
and
interpreting research in this field. Others may relate to fundamental limitations in our ability
to predict new venture performance.
My thinking in this area has been sensitized by research now underway at Purdue. My
colleagues and I have been studying almost 3000 young firms and following these firms
through a three-year period (Cooper et al. 1990). We have been successful in tracking the
survival or discontinuance
of every one of these firms and the growth or decline of a great
many of them. One of the focal points of our research has been to try to predict performance,
based upon variables that can be studied at the time the new firm is established. The
frustrations and successes we have encountered have made us well aware of the problems in
doing this. I shall be making reference to this ongoing work to illustrate some of the problems
we shall be considering.
There are, of course, challenges in forecasting performance for any new undertaking,
whether an independent start-up or a venture within an established corporation. We shall
consider how attempts to forecast performance in independent new ventures may encounter
particular and distinctive problems. Such attempts may be complicated by the diversity
among independent new firms. Thus, “mom and pop” businesses, stable high-payoff firms,
and high-growth
ventures (to use Vesper’s classification-Vesper
1990) reflect such
differences in resource bases, typical environments, and strategies that the problems of trying
to predict performance may vary substantially across them.

EXISTING

THEORETICAL

FRAMEWORKS

AND RESEARCH

FINDINGS

Theoretical frameworks for analyzing influences upon new firm performance are not well
developed. However, one approach is to consider four sets of variables that can be studied at
start-up: entrepreneurs’ characteristics, founding processes, environmental
conditions, and
initial firm attributes-all
of which appear to influence venture performance. (Other factors,
such as changes in the environment and subsequent operating and strategic decisions clearly

influence buoyance
also, but the focus here is upon those variables that can be studied at
start-up.} Figure 1 presents these four sets of variables in the framework of a path analysis, in
which variables such as entrepreneurs’ characteristics and founding processes have both
direct and indirect effects upon pe~o~ance. The inte~elationships may be examined in other
ways as well. For instance, initial firm attributes might be considered as a moderating
variable, in which the influence of particular entrepreneurial characteristics (such as industry
experience) varies according to type of organization (Venkatraman 1989). Analysis might
also focus upon whether gestalts exist in which particular ent~preneu~al ch~acte~stics,
founding processes, environmental conditions, and firm attributes tend to cluster together
(Miller and Friesen 1978).
Using this framework, we see that different streams of research have emphasized
different variables. Thus, the work in ~pulation ecology has examined such firm
characteristics as newness, smallness, and generalist vs. specialist strategies and the dominant
role of the environment in dete~ining which firms survive (Aldrich 1979; Astley and Van de
Ven 1983; Hannan and Freeman 1984).
Research in organization theory and in strategic management has focused upon
environmental characteristics and initial venture characteristics, particularly strategies. Thus,
the extent to which subsequent growth is related to initial market focus and to the
characteristics of founding teams has been examined (Eise~~dt and Sch~~oven
1990), as
has the existence of “archetypes” of new firm strategies and environmental characteristics
(McDougall and Robinson 1990).
Research in en~epreueu~hip has p~icul~ly emph~ized ch~acte~stjcs of entrepreneurs, such as gender, need for achievement, education, m~agement experience, and goals.
These have been examined in regard to whether or not certain attributes of entrepreneurs may
be related to greater chances for success. This research stream has aiso examined founding
processes, such as planning, risk management, use of info~ati~n sources and networking,
team formation, and financing. The relationship between venture performance and initial
characteristics of firms has also been analyzed, including relatedness to the prior organization
of the entrepreneur (Feeser and Willard 1988).
A central theme in much of the research has been to examine influences upon
performance. However, the consideration of these relationships is relatively recent, with most
of the research having been done in the last dozen years. There were some important
antecedents, notably the longitudinal studies by Hoad and Rosko (1964), Mayer and
Goldstein (1961), Roberts ( 1972), and Cooper and Bruno (1977). However, the number and
sophistication of studies have increased substantially in recent years.

PROBLEMS IN INTERPRETING PRIOR RESEARCH
There are several problems in comparing and interpreting the work done to date. There is great
variation in research methods, including case-based inductive studies, cross-sectional survey
research, and longitudinal studies. These longitudinal studies seem particularly promising in
giving us insight into founding variables that influence later performance. (Representative of
recent longitudinal research is the 5’Lyear follow-up study of technical entrepreneurs by
Miner et al. 1991 and the 4-year study of Minnesota entrepreneurs by Reynolds and Miller
1989).
For all studies, a central problem has been the lack of well-developed theories of causal
relationships (VanderWerf 1989; Hisrich 1988). This makes it difficult to interpret the spotty and
sometimes inconsistent findings to date. Much of the work that has been done might be criticized
for being weak at the front end, for lacking theoretical frameworks to drive the research.
There is also great variation in samples. Among the 1.3 million ventures starting in the
United States each year, there is, in fact, great diversity. Gartner (1985) noted that the
differences among entrepreneurs
and across their ventures are as great as the variation
between entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs
and between new firms and established firms.
Most empirical studies have been based upon focused samples, such as technical firms in
Silicon Valley, manufacturing businesses in Pittsburgh, or companies started in Minnesota in
1979 or 1982. Findings from such studies may reflect those particular samples, but may or
may not be broadly applicable. Furthermore, at this stage in the development of the field, we
do not know whether or not there are contingent relationships. Thus, the presence of teams of
founders and close relationships to prior organization, variables that seem to relate to success
for high-technology
firms, may or may not be equally important for small retail and service
businesses. As we consider how sample selection may have affected research that has been
done to date, we should note that studies may reflect the kinds of firms that are easiest to
study. Thus, very young firms and those that die quickly are often difficult to identify and so
are often not included in samples. (In passing, it should be recognized that the question of
when a firm is started is by no means clear-cut (Reynolds and Miller 1989)). At any rate, as
we seek to develop better theoretical frameworks, the diversity among entrepreneurial firms
should be kept in mind.
Another problem relates to the variety of performance measures that have been utilized.
Survival versus discontinuance
has often been used, particularly in population ecology
with different levels of performance, some being
studies. However, firms may “survive”
marginal and others outstanding. Growth measures, considering sales or employee growth,
have often been used. Some studies have used absolute size as a performance measure,
without necessarily measuring growth rate. Subjective assessments of performance or indices
of performance have also been utilized. These depend, of course, upon how the index was
weighted or the expectations of the entrepreneur.
Sapienza, Smith, and Gannon (1988)
examined whether or not subjective assessments of sales growth and return on sales were
related to objective measures; they found no significant correlations.
This variety of
performance measures that has been used makes comparisons across studies difficult.
There are also problems relating to the ways in which data have been analyzed. Earlier
studies used cross-tabulations
or univariate analysis. It is only recently that an increasing
number of studies have utilized multivariate methods. In general, analytical methods used to
date have been less sophisticated than those characterizing
many of the older fields of
management.
As we seek to interpret prior studies and build theoretical frameworks, we should
recognize the lack of comparability
and, in some cases, the weaknesses of much of the

<-----Page 4----->PREDICTING NEW FIRM PERFORMANCE

it&

empirical work to date. This awareness should help us to understand the mixed patterns of
findings reported. They should also guide us as we plan research for the future.
There have been several articles that review the extant literature and consider the extent
to which there seem to be clear predictors of success for new firms (Low and MacMillan
1988; VanderWerf 1989; Woo, Daellenbach, and Nicholls-Nixon 1990; Cooper and
Gimeno-Gascon 1992). There are some consistent findings, but there ate also many
differences across studies. Thus, one review reported upon seven previous studies in which
the relationship between new firm performance and prior experience in the same industry for
the entrepreneur was examined. Three studies found positive relationships, one found mixed
relationships, and three found no significant relationships (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon
1992). These diverse patterns seem to have been typical for a number of variables that have
been studied. Fu~he~ore, research seeking to build models to explain new firm ~~o~~~e
has often reported large amounts of unexplained variance (Woo et al. 1990). It is clear that
predicting new firm performance is challenging. In this paper, I examine some of the reasons
for the limited success to date.
The growing body of empirical studies may offer opportunities for meta analysis. This
methodology, which takes into account both the strength of relationships in prior studies and
sample sizes, has not received much attention in the entrepreneurship field to date. It has been
applied to a number of fields where there is a body of research studies to interpret. For
instance, it has been applied to such questions as the relationship between strategic planning
and financial performance (Boyd 1991) and the various influences upon organizational
i~ovation (Damanpour 199 1).

STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND UNSTABLE PERFORMANCE
The work in population ecology, organization theory, and strategy all call our attention to the
dominant role environment plays in influencing firm performance. Factors outside the direct
control of the entrepreneur, such as the carrying capacity of an industry, may affect the
number of existing firms that are able to survive (Aldrich 1990). Major environmental change
may select out many existing firms because they are no longer suited to a changed
environment (Hannan and Freeman 1984). The upshot is that the performance of firms may
depend, in part, upon whether or not they are in the right place at the right time. Of course, one
of the central responsibilities of managers and of entrepreneurs is to evaluate the
attractiveness of indus~es they contemplate entering and to formulate strategies that take into
account both their resources and the environment (Vesper 1990). However, the point goes
beyond that. Firms that were originally well-conceived and managed may fail because of
subsequent unforeseen changes in the environment. Furthermore, many new firms are
positioned in developing and turbulent markets, where the challenges of adaptation are
particularly severe.
Such events can impact all firms, including new ventures within established corporations.
However, independent new firms may be particularly vulnerable. New firms have strategies
characterized by limited lines of products or services offered to very particular markets. (For our
sample of 2994 new firms, 64% estimated that at least 80% of their customers were located
within 25 miles of the business.) These focused strategies can lead to superior performance. If
things go well, there is no averaging effect in which other product lines or older facilities or
less-effective employees pull buoyance
down. However, the concen~ation of risk upon a
narrow resource base and the dependence upon narrow markets means that performance often
is not stable. Thus, the opening of a strong competitor, such as a Walmart in the neighborhood,

<-----Page 5----->246

the closing of access streets due to construction, or the lessening of local purchasing power due
to plant closings or strikes-all can have devas~ting impacts upon new and not very
well-es~blished firms. In new firms, the challenge of adapting to a changing environment is
compounded by a reliance upon a narrow resource base-a particular facility and a few key
employees and suppliers. Thus, a fire or accident or the departure of a key employee may make
it difficult to keep the new firm going. Because the new business is built around the
entrepreneur, key events in that person’s life may impact the firm. Fights with partners, serious
illness, or the realization that business ownership is less satisfying than expected may lead to
failure or simply to giving up. The inde~ndent start-up may find it pa~icul~ly dif~cult to deal
with the many shocks and unanticipated problems that can arise.
Another source of instability in new ventures is internal change, which can reflect
attempts to adjust to turbulent environments Change also can result from experimentation
and learning as the en~epreneur tries to determine how to compete most effectively. In
addition, changes can result from rapid growth. Writers in population ecology have argued
persuasively that established organizations have substantial inertia so that it is difficult for
them to change, particularly with regard to core features of the organization (Hannan and
Freeman 1984). They suggest that small organizations may be less subject to inertial forces
and be more likely to change; however, they argue that these firms are also more likely to die
in the process.
Notwi~standing the presence of inertia and the risks of change, we have found, in our
sample of 2994 firms, that many of these firms seem to have changed along a variety of
dimensions. Thus, of the 877 firms reporting in the third year, 43% reported that they had
added products or services in the previous year and 20% indicated that they had dropped
products or services. Ten percent reported that they had lost full-time partners, a change that
would seem to affect a core feature of a young firm. Fu~e~ore,
13% had changed locations
and 5% had even changed company names. These firms seem to be changing in a number of
ways, which may complicate the task of predicting their performance, A very successful small
firm may become a mediocre or even failing firm as it outgrows the entrepreneurs or the
management methods that accounted for its earlier success. Thus, rapidly growing new firms
may find that their very success leads to changes that make their performance unstable.
All of this means that performance in new firms is often erratic. Consider the “INC.
500,” a set of privately held companies that have experienced phenomenal growth (average
compound annual growth rate of sales over the previous four years of 97% for the 500 firms
listed in December 1989). In some years INC. reports what happened to the firms that made
the list in the previous year. They usually report that some of those amazingly successful
firms subsequently failed. One of the early studies in en~epreneu~hip sought to determine
factors associated with success and failure in small m~ufac~~ng firms. In the midst of the
study, the researchers found that some of the firms changed performance categories, i.e.,
successful firms became unsuccessful (Woodruff and Alexander 1958).
The success of independent start-ups in dealing with unexpected events may depend
upon whether or not there are insulating or coping mechanisms (Woo et al. 1990). Low and
MacMillan (1988) suggested that ventures can shape their own luck in part by being
p~imonious in the use of resources, locating in protected markets, moving incrementally,
and building networks. New firms usually have little slack, but may, under some
circumstances, have substantial flexibility (Woo, Nicholls-Nixon, and Cooper 1991). This
may enable some new ventures to respond more effectively than others to unexpected events.
The degree of insulation from environmen~l shock or the ability to cope with an uncertain
environment appear to be important concepts that have yet to be inco~orated in our research

<-----Page 6----->PREDICTINCi NEW FIRM PERFORMANCE

247

designs. The stochastic nature of the processes impacting new firms may impose real limits
upon our ability to predict performance; however, to date little has been done to explore the
factors bearing upon the ability to cope with unexpected change.
The authors of three articles have suggested that chaos theory may be applicable to
entrepreneurial processes. They argue that entrepreneurship inevitably focuses upon change.
Relationships across variables may be changing rather than stable and the sequence by which
events occur may affect outcomes (Stevenson and Harmeling 1990). Furthermore, outcomes
such as the formation or performance of firms may be enormously sensitive to slight
differences in beginning conditions. “Nonlinear systems, such as we might expect to find in
entrepreneurship, are potentially fraught with problems if we try to make predictions about
their future behavior” (Bygrave 1989, p. 28). This suggests that efforts “to target selected
companies for super-that
is, that seek to pick winners and losers-is doomed to failure”
(Smilor and Feeser 1991, p. 171). To the extent that these observations apply, entrepreneurial
performance may be extremely difficult to predict because of the unstable discontinuous
relationships that may exist between initial conditions and subsequent performance.

GOALS-NONECONOMIC

AND MIXED MOTIVE

Research on occupational choices suggests that a number of factors interact as people make
career choices (Lawler 1973). Entrepreneurs also appear to vary in their primary motivations,
as revealed in the numerous research studies that have examined differences in primary goals
of entrepreneurs. One study classified organi~tions as “craft,” “promotion,” and
“adminis~ative” types, with the primary objectives of the chief executive being
“comfort-survival,”
“personal achievement,” and “market adaptation,” respectively
(Filley and Aldag 1978). Another developed an entrepreneuria1 typology of “caretakers” and
“managers,” with the former particularly seeking “to let you do the kind of work you want
to do” and the latter emphasizing primarily financial goals (Braden 1977). Others have
emphasized that business owners may vary substantially in their orientation toward
innovation and growth (Carland et al. 1984).
The primary motivations of the entrepreneur bear upon not only the decision to start but
also upon decisions about how to manage, including whether or not to grow the firm
aggressively. The success level attained by a young firm may depend upon whether or not
other competent managers are added (and authority is shared), whether or not outside
investors are brought in (and ownership is diffused), and whether or not inves~ents in the
future are made (and current income Ievels are risked). Whether a business stabilizes at a low
level or grows may also depend upon the entrepreneur’s desire for current compensation and
a comfortable lifestyle versus sacrifices to build for the future. If the philosophy is “life is
uncertain, eat dessert first,” then the young firm is not very likely to achieve high growth. All
of these decisions depend upon the values of the entrepreneur. Davidsson (1989) investigated
the willingness of entrepreneurs to pursue growth and found that many were not motivated to
pursue substantial growth, in part because of fear of reduced control and concern about
heavier personal workloads. Thus, firms started with great promise may not realize their
potential, and firms that may appear to have modest prospects show growth because of the
drive of the founder.
A substantial body of research done to date has treated survival versus discontinu~ce as
categorical measures of performance. The assumption is that one represents a degree of
success and the other of failure. However, we should recognize that the decision to continue
or close down may be an intensely personal decision, one influenced by the values and

<-----Page 7----->248

perceived alternatives of the individual entrepreneur. Thus, entrepreneurs who are wellprepared, with strong educations, management experience, and high needs for achievement,
may be dissatisfied with marginal performance because they think they can do better. Their
counterparts with weak preparation may demonstrate great tenacity because they perceive no
alternatives. For a firm with marginal performance, the continuance or discontinuance of the
business may depend upon the entrepreneur’s required threshold levels of performance. Thus,
we have the dilemma that strong preparation may increase the probability of venture success,
but that same strong prep~ation may impose a higher minimum level of performance
required by the entrep~neur to keep the business going. Likewise, a business that appears to
satisfy highly valued noneconomic goals of the entrepreneur (such as being independent) may
have low threshold levels of performance required to stay in that business. Econometricians
have devetoped methods to estimate unobserved, stochastic thresholds. Such models have
been applied in fields such as labor economics, looking at threshold levels of wages required
for housewives to enter or stay out of the labor market (Nelson 1977). In that research, the
threshold level was affected by such variables as the number and ages of children and
education of the housewife and her husband. We are currently using data from our study of
2994 entrepreneurs to determine whether or not minimum threshold levels differ for
entrepreneurs whose backgrounds make it likely that they will have different perceived
opportunities. However, as noted above, whether or not they stay in business and their
patterns of development may depend greatly upon the goals of the founder.

DO PREDICTORS OF SUCCESS VARY BY TYPE OF VENTURE OR BY
LEVEL OF PERFOR~NCE?
The diversity of new enterprises raises questions about the ways in which “type of venture”
may influence performance. Thus, there may be some differences in the critical variables
leading to success for mom-and-pop businesses, stable high pay-off firms, and high potential
ventures. These kinds of firms clearly vary in their probable scale and need for the managerial
skills associated with building and directing an organization. They probably differ in their
degree of reliance upon the entrepreneur’s technical or operating skills. Thus, a mom-and-pop
business, such as an auto repair shop, may depend greatly upon the founder’s mechanical
skills, while a high-grows venture may require substantial financial resources and the ability
to develop an organization.
One reason why prior research shows such spotty results may be because we have not
examined systematically how venture type may exert direct or indirect effects or how it may
moderate other ~lationships being studied ~Ve~atrarn~ 1989). Thus, industry experience
may be critical in high-technology firms or in those fields in which operating knowledge is
not widely diffused. In other fields, such as restaurants, it may be possible to acquire many of
the needed skills through franchise arrangements or from suppliers.
The clear conclusion is that we must use care in pooling samples and in interpreting prior
research. Also needed are better theoretical frameworks that enable us to think about the
variables directly or indirectly affecting new venture performance. This kind of unders~ding
should permit us to think about what factors are of general impo~ance across all new firms,
They should also help us to consider me~ingful ways in which firms may differ and thus help
us to develop typologies that illuminate differences across types of firms.
As we seek to predict success in new firms, it should be recognized that drivers of
performance may differ according to the performance level achieved. Thus, factors increasing
the probability of marginal survival may differ from those bearing upon the probability of

<-----Page 8----->PREDICTING NEW FIRM PERFORMANCE

249

high growth. As an example, age of the entrepreneur may be related to performance, but in
ways that differ by measure of performance considered. One review of prior research noted
that three studies had found that older entrepreneurs were more likely to survive or have
higher income, and three other studies found that the firms of older entrepreneurs were less
likely to grow (Cooper and Gimeno-Gascon
1992). Although these differences have not been
systematically explored, it may be that older entrepreneurs are less likely to invest (and risk)
the time and money needed to grow. However, they may be less inclined to close down
marginal businesses because they perceive fewer employment alternatives.
These distinctions have received little attention to date. We have found in our research
on 2994 young firms that there do seem to be some differences in the factors bearing upon
different levels of performance. Thus, we found that having parents who owned a business
appeared to increase the probability of marginal survival, but not of growth. However, gender
(being male), having full-time partners, and not being in retailing or personal services
increased the probability of high growth, but not the probability of marginal survival (Cooper,
Gimeno-Gascon,
and Woo 1991). We can speculate about, although we do not fully
understand, the reasons for these differences. Future research might profitably explore the
extent to which the predictors of performance vary according to different dimensions or levels
of performance and the reasons for these differences.

STUDIED

VARIABLES

VERSUS

VARIABLES

THAT

ARE

IMPORTANT

Research to date has tended to focus upon variables that are relatively easy to gather
information about or to measure. This may not be the same as focusing upon the variables
that most bear upon performance. Many studies have examined entrepreneurial
attributes,
such as age, gender, education, and whether the entrepreneur had experience in the same
industry. These offer the advantage of being accessible through questionnaires.
Many of
these variables presumably are proxies for the underlying knowledge, skills, or drive that
really contribute to performance differences; however, the underlying variables usually are
not studied. Our models may leave much unexplained
variance because we are not
measuring the right things.
Some of the variables that we need to study may be relatively obscure, sometimes
because the entrepreneurs wish to keep a low profile or because of the strategic information
advantages of obscurity. Other variables may relate to unique events and thus be overlooked
(MacMillan and Katz 1992).
Behavioral characteristics,
such as commitment and determination
and the ability to
enlist the assistance of others, may deserve more attention than they have received to date.
Research reporting the criteria applied by venture capitalists as they evaluate new ventures
suggest that these professional investors focus upon factors that have not received much
attention in academic research. For instance, some of the factors that they weigh most heavily
include whether or not the entrepreneur is “capable of sustained intense effort” and is “able
to evaluate and react to risk well” (MacMillan et al. 1985).
What VanderWerf (1989) has termed the “How” variables could be studied much more
aggressively than has been done to this point. Research might focus upon the processes followed,
such as how relationships were developed with key employees and suppliers or how information
was gained about consumer preferences. There is some evidence that many independent
entrepreneurs are able to assemble resources at very low cost. They may be able to co-opt these
resources more easily than their corporate counterparts because they are not constrained by
corporate mindsets and are not required to abide by corporate rules (Starr and MacMillan 1990).

<-----Page 9----->250

A. C. COOFBR

Block and MacMillan (1985) suggested that a new venture is an experiment with implicit
hypotheses. Woo and co-authors (1990) emphasized that entrepreneurship is a process of
ex~~mentation and learning. En~epreneu~ must assess the environment as they search for
opportunities, and they must interpret feedback from the marketplace as their ventures unfold.
The cognitive processes followed by entrepreneurs, including those who are successful and
those who are not, have received very little attention.
We might expect that independent start-ups, with their limited resources and need to
establish a foot-hold where they had no presence before, would be heavily dependent upon
decisions about strategy. There has been some examination of relationships between market
characteristics, competitive strategy variables, and the performance of young firms (Sandberg
and Hofer 1987; Feeser and WiIl~d 1990; McDougall and Robinson 1990). Probably most
has been done in considering venture strategies within the corporate context and utilizing the
PIMS database. However, research on strategies of independent ventures has been limited,
with many unexploited opportunities to apply some of the conceptual frameworks that have
been developed in the field of strategic management.
These kinds of research probably require departure from the survey research so common
in the field. They may also call for different theoretical frameworks and deeper involvement
with the entrepreneurial ventures. There may be trade-offs between sample size and the
research methods appropriate for these questions. The criticisms raised here could certainly be
posed in regard to the work my colleagues and I have been doing as we followed 2994
entrepreneurs through time. We designed questionnaires that could be self-administered and
completed in about 15 minutes. As we work with this large data-base, we are often reminded
that we are dealing with variables that lend themselves to surveys, rather than examining the
underlying factors that may be driving performance.

CONCLUSIONS
At this time our ability to predict performance of new firms is limited. It may be that some of
the factors reviewed here, particularly the stochastic nature of the processes, the importance
of noneconomic goals, and the instability of performance levels, place limits on what can be
done. Corporate ventures are also un~e~ain, and their prospects depend upon many contextual
variables relating to the strategy and structure of the corporation. However, some of the
problems of forecasting venture performance may be particularly challenging for independent
start-ups.
Nevertheless, we should recognize that this is a young field. It is only in the last decade
or two that researchers have begun to study systematically the factors bearing upon the birth
of new firms and their subsequent performance. Prior to 1980, there were no journals and no
regularly scheduled conferences dedicated to en~ep~neurship. Now, there are about 14
journals and, in some years, over a dozen conferences (Katz 1992, p. 28). A growing cohort
of researchers is working in the field, including young faculty with solid training in research
methodology and the drive associated with trying to “make their careers” in the field.
Attempts to predict the performance of new firms are likely to continue to be central to
the study of entrep~neu~hip. Despite the inherent problems mentioned above, my view is
that we can do better. The challenges discussed here suggest a number of opportunities for
future research:
1. We need better theoretical frameworks and more theory-driven empirical research. In
some cases our understanding may be advanced by borrowing constructs and
theoretical frameworks from other fields (MacMillan and Katz 1992). In doing this we

should ensure that our usage reflects a real understanding of the best current thinking in
these fields. For instance, Carsrud and his associates have noted that the failure to use
contem~ra~ concepts in the behavioral sciences has been one reason for disappointing
research on the role of personality traits of entrepreneurs (Cat-stud, Gaglio, and Olm
1987).
The influence of environmental uncertainty may limit our ability to predict individual
firm performance. However, the strong influence of the environment may also present
opportunities for research. We might examine more explicitly the factors influencing the
ability of new ventures to function in turbulent environments. Research might also
examine the nature and effectiveness of insulating mechanisms or the factors bearing
upon the ability of ventures to bring about successful change.
Although entrepreneurs’ differing goals complicate the task of predicting performance,
they also present research oppo~unities. More could be done in examining entrepreneurs’
goals (as measured at different times) and their career alternatives (as perceived at
different times) and how these bear upon decisions about starting, growing, and
terminating ventures.
The diversity among entrepreneurs and ventures presents challenges in planning and
interpreting research. However, this diversity raises opportunities in that we need to learn
more about how type of entrepreneur or type of venture acts as a moderator in influencing
relationships between predictors and buoyance.
We also need to unde~tand more
fully the effects of different performance measures and whether the factors that enhance
performance vary according to the measure used.
We should examine the variables that seem to be important, even if they are not easy to
study. Exploratory research and a variety of research methodologies may be needed as we
seek to understand processes that have not been studied much to this point.

It is easy to be critical of a young developing field, implicitly applying the standards of more
mature fields that represent the fruits of decades of scholarship. However, this is an exciting
field that continues to develop, a field not constrained by a required adherence to an
established orthodoxy. One of the strengths of the field of entrepreneurship has been its
openness to a variety of approaches. This has led to many very interesting questions being
posed, even though they may not have been pursued in great depth. My hope is that we can
continue this creativity and this openness, even as we work toward more rigor.
Although there are major challenges in predicting new firm performance, progress has
been made. I would suggest that we need to be sensitive to the special problems discussed
here as we seek to build upon what has been done and to increase our understanding of the
factors bearing upon new firm performance.
