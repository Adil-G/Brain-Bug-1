past performance and future
expectations
Jagdish N. Sheth

Introduction
The purpose of this invited paper is to assess what has happened since the
publication of the paper, “A model of industrial buyer behavior” (Sheth,
1973), and to suggest future academic research opportunities and challenges
with respect to theory, methods and empirical observations in organizational
buyer behavior (OBB).
As we all know, forecasting the future is a highly risky business, especially
if you live through the future. However, I will attempt to do this one more
time in this paper for two reasons: First, I probably will not be around to
witness the future, and second, the best way to forecast the future is to create
one! Therefore, in this paper I will “fast forward” the assessment of
academic research conducted since the early 1970s and spend more time
suggesting new and exciting research opportunities and challenges in interorganization buyer behavior. In the Appendix, a detailed review of academic
research of the past 25 years is provided.

Descriptive model

Fast forward
My first exposure to, and experience with OBB was in 1962 at the
University of Pittsburgh. Under the leadership of Professor John Howard,
several of us doctoral students were trying to develop a descriptive model of
how industrial buyers make buying decisions and supplier selection. I
distinctly remember interviewing industrial buyers of steel companies in
Pittsburgh about their purchase of industrial fasteners (bolts and nuts) and
electrical motors. At that time, the marketing discipline had just discovered
the marketing concept; and brand loyalty, retailing and mass advertising
were influential in the development of marketing thought (Sheth et al. 1989).
Consequently, I was surprised to discover that industrial, institutional, and
trade buying behaviors were rich with empirical evidence, concepts, and
methodology (Sheth, 1973, 1976).
Since the early 1980s, research on OBB has simply exploded (Ward and
Webster, 1991). This can be attributed to at least three reasons. First, the
shift from understanding and influencing consumers to customers
(industrial, institutional, and trade) has led to a greater focus on OBB.
Second, both the academic journals and business professional organizations,
including the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM),
have encouraged research and, publications on inter-organization buying
behavior. Finally, as suggested in Sheth et al. (1988), the marketing
discipline is increasingly influenced by the disciplines of organizational

economics.
Three conceptual models

The three conceptual models in OBB published in the 1960s and 1970s
(Robinson et al., 1967; Sheth, 1973; Webster and Wind, 1972) were also
significantly influential in generating academic interest in organizational
buying behavior. The concepts of Make-Buy and Modified-Rebuy; the
Buying Center; the behavioral aspects of decision making; the joint vs.
autonomous decisions; and conflict resolution in joint-decision making
processes led to significant research as summarized in the Appendix of this
paper.
Perhaps the most popular area of research in OBB has been the
understanding of the decision-making process, its antecedents, as well as
mediating and moderating contextual variables. In particular, marketing
scholars have tried to apply behavioral and economic concepts of power,
conflict, and influence in understanding the group dynamics within the
buying center. Most of the research methodology for studying this
phenomenon has been survey research wherein a key informant is asked to
either role play or recall incidents of specific organizational buying
decisions.

Three research streams

However, there have also emerged three additional research streams that are
worth noting. The first has to do with buyer-seller interaction and buyerseller relationships, especially in the area of channels as customers. This
stream of research is heavily influenced by El-Ansary and Stern’s (1972)
classic work on power, dependence, and conflict, and later on by
Williamson’s transaction cost theory.
A second stream of research has focused on partnering with suppliers to
achieve better product quality and customer satisfaction. Included in this
stream of research are the clinical case studies of supplier partnering
relationships carried out by the IMP group in Scandinavia, and subsequent
use of networks theory and methodology to quantitatively measure the
strength of the customer-supplier relationships over time.
A third major research trend is focused on supply chain partnering and the
use of information technology (networked computing and on-line data
services). This includes quick response, just-in-time, and the use of
electronic data interchange (EDI) for maximizing efficiency through
economies of time (reduced cycle times) and mass customization in sharp
contrast to the older theories of economies of scale and scope.
Assessment
This fast forward review of the past 20 plus years, surprisingly, generated
the same feelings and reactions as the first review I did in the 1970s. Despite
continued impressive research in OBB, I believe there is still a perception
today among marketing scholars that it is a neglected area of marketing. I
cited several reasons for that belief in the 1970s (Sheth, 1978). Let us see if
the same holds true even today.
“First, most research in organizational buying behavior has been practiceoriented and less academic oriented” (Sheth, 1978, p. 65). This, I believe, is
still true but to a less extent. More papers on OBB are now published in the

8

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING VOL. 11 NO. 3/4 1996

<-----Page 2----->first tier academic journals, and probably reflect better scientific approach at
least in terms of logical positivism tradition of scientific inquiry.
Generating knowledge

“Second, more good research seems to have been conducted in Europe than
in the US and therefore, we are not as aware of its existence” (Sheth, 1978,
p. 65). This fact is still very prevalent in terms of generating knowledge (we
only have to look at the impressive research tradition of the IMP group and
more recently in the services marketing area). However, it is better
disseminated today through publications in US journals as well as more
active participation by the European scholars in the US based academic
conferences.
“Furthermore, research in organizational buying is also scattered across
several disciplines such as political science, organizational psychology, and
several sub-areas of business including production, finance, and personnel
management” (Sheth, 1978, p. 65). Today, this is even more true as scholars
in other disciplines have focused their research on the economic aspects of
organizational behavior and particularly on buying behavior due to the
recent interests in total quality management (TQM), and supplier partnering
relationships.
“Third, it seems easier to relate to consumer behavior based on researcher’s
own introspective analysis of personal experiences but requires additional
efforts to experience and learn the reality in organizational buyer behavior
prior to conducting research. As such, borrowing and applying many of the
theories and methods from the behavioral sciences seems more
straightforward in consumer behavior than in organizational buying
behavior” (Sheth, 1978, p. 65). This idea is less true today primarily because
it is more and more prevalent for marketing scholars to have three to four
years of work experience before starting the postgraduate education. At the
same time, bulk of field research conducted in the postgraduate courses still
tends to be the study of consumers versus customers. Furthermore, the trend
is likely to persist unless the early training during the coursework and
internships is consciously channelled toward business-to-business markets.

Hard sciences and
economics

“Finally, it is true that consumer marketers have tended to be more receptive
and less hard-nosed about applying new and different techniques and
theories of behavioral sciences probably because of the presumption that
consumer behavior is, by definition, more complex and emotional than
organizational buying behavior. Therefore, consumer behavior and consumer
marketing have distinguished themselves as the leading edge of the
marketing discipline. Hence, the popular belief that research in
organizational buying behavior is scarce, non-scholarly, and more trade
oriented” (Sheth, 1978, pp. 65-55). I believe this is much less true today than
25 years ago. Indeed, some of the best young scholars in business-tobusiness marketing are trained in hard sciences, industrial organizations, and
economics, as well as committed to academic research in OBB.
While the last 25 years of research has continued the tradition of earlier
research and have moved up the ladder of academic rigor and relevance, I
see some challenges and opportunities in business-to-business marketing
which paralleled similar efforts in international marketing and more
recently in services marketing. First, business-to-business marketing will
not become a discipline unless it is anchored to a well-respected theory

<-----Page 3----->whether home grown or imported. This seems to have made a significant
difference in the respectability of consumer research and to some extent
marketing strategy in marketing. So far, business-to-business marketing
seems to be still in search of a good theory, and therefore, it is
predominantly context driven similar to international marketing. Second,
business-to-business marketing must become methodologically more
sophisticated especially as compared to other areas of marketing such as
brand equity, product life cycle, and advertising. The latter have utilized the
econometric and mathematical modelling and analytical tools to enhance
scientific knowledge and respectability. While the use of LISREL,
networks, and other multivariate techniques in business-to-business markets
is admirable and in the right direction, the potential to do more is enormous.
Also, it will be highly desirable to rely less on surveys of subjective
perceptions of key informants as the basic data collection procedure, and
instead use more financial and other analytical data bases similar to
COMPUSTAT and PIMS databases. Figure 1 thus suggests surpluses and
shortages of research in OBB.
Total quality
management philosophy

OBB has been dramatically changing since the 1970s for at least four
reasons (Figure 2). First, global competitiveness, especially in the
manufacturing sector, such as process machinery, automobiles and heavy
engineering, have pointed out the competitive advantages of creating and
managing supply chain relationships. Second, emergence of the TQM
philosophy has encouraged “reverse marketing” starting with external
customers and moving backward into procurement processes and
practices, especially as they relate to reduced cycle times and zero
inventory management. For example, demand driven manufacturing
(DDM) or flexible manufacturing and operations have been instituted in
order to serve the diversity of demand with respect to form, place and
time value to customers. Third, industry restructuring through mergers,
acquisitions and alliances on a global basis has reorganized the
procurement function from a decentralized administrative function to a
centralized strategic function. This is further intensified by outsourcing
(buy vs make), many support functions such as data processing, and
human resources. Finally, use of information technologies including

Two-dimensional shift

Fundamentally, the consequence of changing paradigms of OBB is likely to
result in a two-dimensional shift as shown in Figure 3.
As OBB shifts from a transaction centred to a relational-centred philosophy,
and as it shifts from a decentralized domestic sourcing to a centralized
global sourcing process, most of the academic research and theory related to
organizational decision making including the buying center concept, make
vs. buy decisions, sources of interdepartmental conflict and its resolution,
and buyer-supplier negotiations will become obsolete. As Eric Hoffer, the
philosopher historian has eloquently stated: “In times of drastic change, it is

<-----Page 5----->the learners who inherit the future. The learned find themselves equipped
with a world that no longer exists.” I believe our older knowledge in OBB is
likely to be less and less valuable. We need to learn new concepts, methods
and theories appropriate for the new world of OBB.
Crisis of relevance

There is enough precedent in marketing for this crisis of relevance. For
example, scholars who studied operations research found themselves caught
in the transition to multivariate techniques. Similarly, within multivariate
techniques, we witnessed the shifts from the traditional regression,
discriminant and factor analysis to logit-probit models, on the one hand, and
LISREL on the other hand. Similar shifts of knowledge took place in the
substantive areas of marketing. For example, behavioral theories of
marketing were superseded by competitive strategy theories and concepts
from industrial organizations, and more recently the market transactions
theories and concepts are giving way to hierarchies and networks as
organizational frameworks.
The good news is that as the half life of academic knowledge declines
exponentially, it is also creating enormous opportunities for future research
in OBB (see Figure 4). The following areas of future research look very
promising for academic research as the procurement practice changes from
transaction centred to relationship centred, and from domestic to global
sourcing:
•

Supplier as customer. As supply function becomes more a strategic
differentiator and a core competency, it will encourage treating suppliers
less as vendors and more like partners. Therefore, the buying
organizations will have to develop both commitment and trust. It is
possible to be a world class supplier, but it is very difficult to be a world
class customer. Customers often engage in opportunistic behavior even
though they are happy with existing suppliers by exercising their market
power. This results in lack of a trusting relationship. Most suppliers
therefore, do not trust their customers. Similarly, business customers do

be dependent on them. Therefore, they do not make a commitment by
reducing their choices. In the future, business customers will have to
reduce the number of suppliers and invest in a handful of suppliers with
respect to training, capital and know how. In other words, what
companies do with their customers with respect to customer selectivity
and key account management processes and practices will become
equally important for managing relationships with their supplier
community.
Buying center structure
and process

Outsource internal
activities

Establishing processes
and platforms

•

Cross-functional supplier teams. As business customers begin to source
on a global and relational basis with their key suppliers, they will have
to internally create and maintain cross-functional teams that are
dedicated or focussed on their key suppliers. As these cross-functional
supplier teams replace the buying center structure and process, there will
be a need for academic frameworks, concepts, and methods to study and
enhance performance of cross-functional supplier teams.

•

Does partnering pay? Just as relationship marketing is struggling with
the issue of return on investing in relationships with customers, there
will be similar concerns about partnering with suppliers. Therefore, what
will be very desirable is to develop a performance metric that
analytically quantifies supplier relationship equity. My a priori
hypothesis is that similar to smaller market share brand names whose
cost of maintenance is more that its value, supplier partnering with
smaller share suppliers will not be economical. This should result in
supplier selectivity.

•

Supply experience curves. Managing supplier relationships on a global
basis is not an easy task as most business customers have realized.
Therefore, in industries where supply function is a key strategic
advantage, companies will focus on creating core competency in supply
side management and develop sharper experience curves. Therefore, we
need to learn how to apply experience curve concepts and methods to
supply side management similar to what is applied in manufacturing.

•

Hub and spokes organization. As organizations reduce the number of
suppliers in each product or service category, and at the same time
outsource internal activities, there will be a need for developing a hub
and spoke organization in which one or two suppliers in each product or
service category are the spokes and the procurement organization
becomes the hub on a global basis. This hub and spokes organizational
architecture has analogs in local area networks (LANS) and in computer
assisted logistics systems (CALS). It would be fascinating to use
networks methodology to study the hub and spokes organizational
designs.

•

Bonding with suppliers. Creating, managing, and enhancing ongoing
relationships with suppliers on a global basis will require organizations
to learn about, and invest in bonding processes and philosophies similar
to what organizations are learning and practicing with their customers.
What are the governance concepts and processes for bonding with
suppliers? Are they different from the governance processes appropriate
for bonding with customers?

•

Global sourcing. This is a key driver for future academic research.
While several global enterprises, especially in the automotive, high
technology and the aerospace industries are establishing processes and

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING VOL. 11 NO. 3/4 1996

13

<-----Page 7----->platforms, it is still at an infancy stage of practice in other industries.
Similarly, there is no real academic framework that provides insights
and explanations for global sourcing. At best, we have one or two books
on global sourcing that reflect its importance and practice.

Providing value-added
services

•

Cross-cultural values. Both the buying and selling practices and value
systems vary significantly across cultural boundaries. In some cultures,
reciprocity is declared illegal and unethical whereas in other cultures it
is the preferred way of doing business. What is considered as an agency
fee in one country is recognized as a bribe, subject to prosecution under
the anti-corruption laws. Similarly, doing business with family members
and politically connected individuals is presumed to provide a sense of
trust and commitment in some cultures whereas it is considered as
nepotism and unethical behavior in others. This is another area of
academic research of enormous potential.

•

Cross-national rules. Similar to cross-cultural differences, there are also
cross-national rules that regulate economic behaviors of enterprises.
Specifically, the two-tier regulation (one for domestic and the other for
foreign enterprises) is common with respect to ownership, management
control, and coproduction practices. With the rise of nationalism in
recent years, this has become a key issue for global enterprises such as
McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, General Electric, and Enron, especially as they
expand their market scope and supply scope in large emerging nations
such as India, China, and Indonesia.

•

Services procurement. We know a lot about product procurement;
however, our academic knowledge for services procurement seems to be
limited. As organizations outsource more and more internal services,
and as suppliers engage in providing value-added services to their
customers, one expects greater need to understand and research services
procurement. Furthermore, most advanced countries are, defacto,
services economies as measured by employment and GNP contributions.
Services Procurement will have the same issues as what services
marketing scholars have experienced: Are services different than
products? What is the impact of perishability, simultaneity of production
and consumption, and lack of standardization on services procurement
function, especially on a global basis? This has become a major issue in
advertising agencies, professional services (accounting, legal, human
resources and consulting), as well as information services (data
processing, telecommunications and on-line services).

Concluding remarks
The fundamental message of this invited paper for scholars in OBB can be
summed up as good news and bad news. The bad news is that half life of the
impressive knowledge generated in the past 25 years is declining at an
exponential rate. The good news is that the repositioning of the procurement
practice from an administrative, and transaction focused function to a
strategic, and relational focused function is generating numerous future
opportunities for innovative and insightful academic research.

Appendix
Research related to Sheth (1973) and Webster and Wind (1972) models
Decision-making process:

18

•

Dempsey (1978). This reports the results of a study dealing with the vendor selection
process. Based on the results of the study, the author identifies five evaluative criteria
(vendor stability, basic economic criteria, geographic affinity, attendant services, and
assurance mechanisms) and four categories (seller dominated external information, buyer
oriented external information, salesmen, and buyer oriented internal information).

•

Vyas and Woodside (1984). The authors develop an inductive model of supplier choice
processes. Their descriptive, composite model incorporates subroutines of events,
interactions and decisions learned from studying entire industrial buying processes of 18
products.

•

Anderson and Chambers (1985). Describes a new model of organizational buying process
based on the assumption that organizational buying behavior is essentially a form of work
behavior. The model emphasizes the role of reward measurement systems in motivating
purchasing process participants. A second submodel is concerned with the process of
group interaction and consensus formation.

•

Banting et al. (1991). This reports the results of a two nation (Hungary and Canada)
study of the industrial buying process. Similarities as well as differences in purchasing
patterns between the two nations were found.

•

Rangan et al. (1992). This offers a framework for buyer behavior oriented
microsegmentation of industrial customers. Four segments of national accounts of a large
industrial company are identified: transaction buyers, programmed buyers, relationship
buyers and bargain hunters.

•

Dholakia et al. (1993). The authors report an empirical investigation on the length of time
firms take in making major purchase decisions and examines its antecedents. Findings
suggest that firm size, buy-class, decision-making unit (DMU) size, information sources
and size of consideration set, all significantly affect decision-making time.

•

Bunn (1994). The author applies a combination of literature and field-based approaches
to develop four constructs that underlie buyer behavior: procedural control; proactive

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING VOL. 11 NO. 3/4 1996

<-----Page 12----->focusing; use of analysis techniques; and search for information. Measurement scales for
these constructs are created and evaluated through a survey of purchasing professionals.
•

Schmittlein and Peterson (1994). Their model applies customer base analysis in which
past purchase behavior of customers are observed to understand the current and likely
future purchase patterns. Results indicate that customer base analysis can be both
effective in predicting purchase patterns and in generating insights into how key customer
groups differ.

•

Brown (1995). The author tests a conceptual model of the relationships among buyer’s
perspectives of and attitudes toward a vendor company’s marketing mix, and the
moderating effects of insupplier/outsupplier status of the seller. Results indicate
significant moderating effects of insupplier/outsupplier status, and generally validates
predictions made on the basis of attitude theory.

•

Buying center – influence of members of buying center. Silk and Kalwani (1982) reported
findings bearing on the reliability of measures used in industrial market surveys to
identify the structure of buying groups. They found a lack of consensus about purchase
influence between pairs of informants from the same organization. They also found
ratings appear to differentiate among roles but not stages in the decision process.

•

Thomas (1982) studied the nature of interpersonal influence on the individual’s decision
in organizational buying. Findings suggest that social and organizational bases of
influence of personal sources explain changes in a decision maker’s product evaluations.

•

Jackson et al. (1984) carried out work to identify relative influence of participants and
how it changes across purchase of different products, buy classes and procurement
decisions. Findings indicate that the relative influence of the buying center members is
constant in different buy classes, but changes across product types and decision types.

•

Thomas (1984) studied internal relationships among key participants in the buying center.
Findings indicate relative importance of selected bases of power, and their relative
importance by organizational position.

•

Berkowitz (1986) addressed the issue of who the main influencers are in new product
adoption. Findings indicate that end users and technical staff are interested in product
sampling; that price was an important consideration among end users and technical staff;
and that the purchasing department exercised the final authority for ordering.

•

Lynn (1987) analyzed the structure of the buying center for a professional service and
found that CPA buying centers are similar in size and in the number of levels of corporate
hierarchy and functional areas as other industrial services.

•

Kohli and Zaltman (1988) developed a multi-item scale to tap influence, and the process
through which influences are manifested in buying centers.

•

Martin et al. (1988) compared the expectations of buying center role groups for
transportation mode selection and found meaningful differences between role groups.
Findings support the suggestion that role members in a buying center have different
perceptions of suppliers.

•

Kohli (1989) identified factors that affect an individual’s influence in the buying center.
The study found that expert power has the greatest influence followed by reinforcement
power of the individual.

•

McQuiston (1989) focussed on who participates on organizational purchase and decisions
and the factors that affect the interpersonal influence between participants during the
session. This author proposed a structural equation model that suggests the purchase
situation attributes of novelty, complexity and importance are causal determinants of
participation and influence in industrial purchase decisions.

•

Ronchetto et al. (1989) introduced the organizational buying system concept as an
organizational framework for exploring the patterned, repeated interactions that
characterize ongoing purchasing processes. Findings indicate that organizational actors
derive influence from the position they occupy within the buying system. Individual
influence is derived from properties of the formal and informal structure.

•

Buying center – structure. Choffray and Lilien (1980) present a methodology for
segmenting industrial markets on the basis of functional involvement in phases of the
purchasing decision process. Implementation of the methodology in a real life situation
involving industrial cooling systems led to the identification of four segments of
organizations.

<-----Page 13----->•

Woodside and Sherrell (1980) report a study on purchase of industrial equipment in the
paper manufacturing industry. Five decision stages and five overlapping buying centers
were found.

•

Johnston and Bonoma (1981) developed a method for the quantifiable dimensions of a
buying center. They defined and operationalized five interactive dimensions of the buying
center: vertical and lateral involvement; extensiveness; connectedness; and purchasing
manager centrality.

•

Moriarty and Bateson (1982) tested the current methodologies of surveying all members
of a DMU. They found that there was a greater response rate to the use of “snowballing
by telephone” technique as against single stage and exhaustive snowballing.

•

Environmental influences on organizational buying behavior. Grønhaug (1976)
developed a taxonomy for classifying organizations and comparing their behavior in
buying situations, based on the organizations that were product dependent and product
independent and found purchasing activities to be more structured in product dependent
than in product independent organizations. The study also found that search behavior,
buying motives and goals pursued were different in the two types of organizations.

•

Spekman and Stern (1979). presented a conceptual and methodological framework for
examining OBB from a multiperson level of analysis. They view structure as a central
variable for it shapes the nature and degree of interpersonal interaction within the buying
group, and it is also a primary determinant of the buying group’s information acquisition
and processing capabilities.

Based on the in-depth study of 21 buying processes, Drumwright (1994) addresses how and
why socially responsible buying becomes important in organizations. Socially responsible
buying is addressed under the general rubric of noneconomic buying criteria and is observed
from the perspective of concern for the environment.

20

•

Information search. Webster (1970) found little support for word-of-mouth
communication in industrial markets and suggested a key role for manufacturers’
salesmen.

•

Martilla (1971) established the importance of word of mouth communication within
firms and found that the opinion leaders had greater exposure to impersonal information.

•

Moriarty and Spekman (1984) conducted empirical investigation of the sources of
information sought by decision participants and discovered the importance of nonpersonal information.

•

Deshpande and Zaltman (1987) studied the use of marketing information in industrial
firms.

•

Bunn and Clopton (1993) developed the taxonomy of industrial customers information
source use. They concluded that purchase situations are significantly related to choice of
an information source mix.

•

Weiss and Hiede (1993) studied the nature of the search behavior in high technology
markets. They concluded that search behavior is determined in part by certain inherent
characteristics of markets and in part by buyer’s present situation.

•

Organizational climate and role perceptions. Qualls and Puto (1989) explored the
benefits of using organizational climate as one of the factors affecting decision-framing
processes of industrial buyers. Experimental findings indicate that buyer’s general
orientation towards risk affects the frame and, subsequently, the buyers’ choice. However,
there were mixed results with regard to the organizational climate factors affecting
decision frame and subsequent choice.

•

Robertson and Wind (1980) conducted an empirical study that focussed on organizational
climate to explain industrial buying behavior.

•

Spekman (1981) presented organizational type as a potentially important company
specific characteristic that affects the organizational buying process. Differences in the
importance associated with purchasing related factors exist among purchasing managers
from commercial, not-for-profit and governmental organizations.

•

Thomas (1982) conducted an empirical study on the role perceptions of the members of a
buying center.

•

Michaels et al. (1987). Research perspectives from role theory are examined with a large
sample of purchasing professionals. The results suggest that an awareness of the nature

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING VOL. 11 NO. 3/4 1996

<-----Page 14----->and influence of role stress in the buying context could be valuable to marketing
professionals.
•

Henthorne et al. (1993) examined the role played by informal members of the buying
center and their impact on the type and level of risk perceived by the organizational
buyer. Results indicated that informal influence has a significant effect on perceived risk
experienced by the organizational buyer.

•

Conflict resolution. Ryan and Holbrook (1982) propose a construct, decision-specific
conflict, in an attempt to integrate purchasing conflict, exchange transactions and
microsegmentation. Using 17 purchasing decisions faced by automobile fleet
administrators, nomological validity was supported by an inverted U shaped relationship
between conflict and responsibility weighted by time.

•

Barclay (1991) formulated a model of organizational characteristics that affect buying
related interdepartmental conflict and found that organizational characteristics such as
barriers to communication, the reward system and the ambiguity of departmental
responsibilities explain a substantial portion of the variance in the manifestations of
buying related conflict.

Research related to Robinson et al. (1967)
•

Buy-class framework. Bellizi and McVey (1983) based on research conducted in the
commercial construction industry, test the effects of product type and purchase
experience on industrial buyer behavior (to test the validity of the buy - grid model). The
findings indicate that product type is a meaningful variable which is related to industrial
buyer behavior. However, the purchase experience variable or buy-class variable is not
significantly related to buyer behavior.

•

Leigh and Rethans (1984) apply cognitive script theory to the analysis of industrial
purchase behavior in a computer terminal purchase. Industrial buyers’ scripts for the
overall new purchase process, an initial sales call, a follow up negotiation meeting and a
modified rebuy situation are established and validated.

•

Patton et al.’s (1986) research premiss is that in certain types of industrial purchase
decisions (vendor selection in modified rebuy situations), the presence of certain
mediating variables may indicate that the individual purchasing agent rather than a
buying group may make the vendor selection decision. Major findings are that
individual decisions seem to predominate in modified rebuy decisions, that loyalty to
existing suppliers seems to have an effect on the extent of individual decision making
and that the extent of joint decision making appears to be related to the size of the firm.

•

Anderson et al. (1987) used an empirical approach to examine the buy-class framework.
Managers of salesforces were asked about the behavior their salespeople encounter on the
part of their industrial customers. Much of what salespeople observe is found to
correspond closely to the buy-class theory. Also “problem newness” and “information
needs” dimensions are found to be strongly related. However, “seriousness of
consideration of alternatives” seems to be a separate dimension that does not operate
entirely as predicted by the buy-class framework.

•

Wilson et al. (1991) developed a contingency model for predicting buying center choice
using two situations of the RFW framework (modified rebuy and new task decisions) and
three levels of perceived risk. Organizational buying centers in firms responded to
product evaluation decisions. These data were used as input for seven alternate models of
group choice in order to note the predictive accuracies of each model by situation. Major
findings are that in new task situations with high perceived risk, a unanimity model tends
to predict choice most accurately. In modified rebuy situations with moderate to high
risk, group choice models such as a voting model tend to be used; in these, group
judgments are considered but unanimity is not required.

•

Bunn (1993) developed a classification scheme (taxonomy) of buying patterns and
situations. It consists of four prototypical “buying decision approaches” identified
through empirical procedure: search for information, use of analysis techniques, focus on
proactive issues, and reliance on control mechanisms. The use of the particular decision
approach depends on four situational characteristics: purchase importance, task
uncertainity, extensiveness of choice and perceived buyer power.

Research related to buyer – seller interaction models
Dyadic and interactive perspectives. Sheth (1976) provides a comprehensive conceptualization
of the buyer-seller interaction process. It has been postulated that the quality of interaction is a

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING VOL. 11 NO. 3/4 1996

21

<-----Page 15----->function of the compatibility between the buyer and the seller with respect to both the style and
the context of interaction. A number of personal, organizational, and product-specific factors
are described as determinants of style and extent of communication on buyer-seller interaction
processes.

22

•

Bonoma et al. (1977) emphasized in this monograph the need for taking a dyadic
approach.

•

Nicosia and Wind (1977) suggest a model based on inter-organizational and intraorganizational processes during buying decisions. They take a dyadic perspective of
processes in the selling organization as well as processes in the buying organization.
They describe the buying process in terms of individuals and groups, both in selling and
purchasing organizations and in terms of activities performed by them.

•

Bagozzi (1978) provides an exchange theory framework of industrial buying and decision
processes. He emphasizes the interactions between buyers and sellers during the
exchange process and reviews leadership and decision-making, group decision-making
processes (including research and theory in bargaining and negotiation), coalition and
other group effects, and social power approaches.

•

Bonoma et al. (1978) posited a “system paradigm” consisting of an “embeddation model”
in which dyadic relations are contained in an overall system context. They stress the
characteristic of “interdependence” in dyadic relations.

•

Bonoma and Johnston (1978) offer dyadic or two-party models as reconceptualizations
for understanding industrial buying behavior. In the dyadic model, the two most
important variables are the relational variables between the two parties (e.g. trust,
cooperation). The exchanges that take place between the members of the dyad are the
most meaningful of these relational variables. Also included are other variables, such as
situational variables. Exchanges and interrelationships are posited as the basis for
explaining buying behavior.

•

Research focussed on interaction and social variables. Håkaannson (1982) presented the
industrial marketing and purchasing (IMP) group interaction model. Drawing heavily on
the microeconomic notions of the “new institutional economists”, the IMP model reflects
the idea that transaction costs may be reduced when a transaction is internalized in one
unit. The authors prefer to call the “buyers” and “sellers” as actors linked to one another
by “short term exchange” episodes and “long-term exchange” episodes. Besides the
interaction based linkages, the relationship is influenced by its “atmospheres” (e.g. power
dependence, cooperation, expectations etc.).

•

Metcalf et al. (1992) apply the IMP interaction model to study buyer-seller collaborative
efforts or factors that engender close relationships between buyers and sellers. The basic
processes are posited as integral to the development of close buyer-seller relationships:
exchange, cooperation and adaptation.

•

Heide and Miner (1992) examined cooperation between 136 industrial buyers and
suppliers by examining the effects of anticipated interaction and frequency of contact on
buyer-seller cooperation. Using the iterated games framework, they predict that
anticipated open-ended future interaction or extendedness, and frequency of contact will
increase the chances and that a pattern of cooperative behavior will occur, but
performance ambiguity will decrease such chances. Results indicated that extendedness
and frequency are associated with joint cooperation.

•

Negotiation process and strategies. Clopton (1984) pointed out that industrial buyers and
sellers as individual are boundary spanners, linking communication between the two
firms; moreover, when long-term relationships are usually sought and both parties are
expected to emerge from negotiation with favorable outcomes and conflict is prevalent.

•

Perdue and Summers (1991) reported findings from a field study on the relation between
negotiation strategies used by the purchasing agent and the characteristics of the purchase
content (cost sensitivity of the buyer firm, supplier competition, uniqueness of the buying
firm’s specifications, buyer’s cooperative orientation, having information, and formal
planning). Results demonstrate the ability of contextual variables to predict the
negotiation strategies likely to be used by purchasing agents.

•

Perdue (1992) reported the findings from a field study of purchasing agents’ use of ten
aggressive bargaining tactics when negotiating rebuy purchases of components parts.
Results suggest that purchasing agents favor tactics that manipulate the sellers’
perceptions about the degree of competition for the purchase contract to persuade (or
coerce) the seller to concede.

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING VOL. 11 NO. 3/4 1996

<-----Page 16----->•

Dabholkar et al. (1994) proposed a framework of business-to-business interaction that
integrates approaches to bargaining from social psychology and economics in order to
provide a conceptual paradigm emphasizing long-term relationships. They propose a
classification of negotiation behavior along two dimensions and examine the dyadic
negotiation process that translate negotiation behavior into long-term relationships.

•

Buyer-supplier relationships. Dwyer et al. (1987) describe a framework for developing
buyer-seller relationships based on a continuum of contractual, discrete, relational
exchanges.

•

Hallén et al. (1991), on the basis of social exchange theory and resource-dependence
model, formulated a structural model of interfirm adaptation. The model accounts for
mutual adaptation as a consequence of trust-building as well as for unilateral adaptation
due to imbalanced dependence between the parties. Results support the view that
interfirm adaptations are elements in a social exchange.

•

Heide and John (1992) showed that norms play a very significant role in structuring
economically efficient relationships between independent firms.

•

Han et al. (1993) examined how industrial buyers and suppliers perceive recent changes
in business markets and found that major factors influencing companies toward using
fewer suppliers include the need for enhanced performance, cost reduction and greater
technical cooperation. They also found that good relationships are characterized by
mutual trust and satisfactory exchange.

•

Provan (1993) developed theory and hypotheses explaining constraints on the emergence
of opportunism when buyer-supplier relations are considered in a network context. It is
hypothesized that opportunistic behavior of individual network suppliers relative to the
dominant buyer, or hub firm, will decline at increasing levels of embeddedness in an
interdependent supplier-buyer network, despite conditions of high asset specificity and
small numbers bargaining.

•

Anderson et al.(1994) used a network approach to provide a means for understanding the
connectedness of business relationships in a dyadic context. They also conduct a
substantive validity assessment to furnish some empirical support for the constructs.

•

Buyer-seller relationships in channel context. Cadotte and Stern (1979) developed a
dynamic process model for inter-organizational relations in marketing channels. Five
interrelated elements are emphasized: conflict potential; dependence (and its obverse
power); conflict perception; resultant force; and conflict after match. The model is based
on the political-economy perspective of power and dependence.

•

Frazier (1983) developed a framework of inter-organization exchange behavior in
marketing channels.

•

Frazier and Rody (1991) developed hypotheses on the reciprocal use of non-coercive and
coercive influence strategies by the supplier and the distributor in the channel dyad and
on the interrelationships of these strategies with the interfirm power, latent conflict,
manifest conflict, and conflict resolution constructs. Hypotheses are generally supported
by data from a national survey of industrial distributors.

•

Boyle et al. (1992) developed new measures of influence strategies in marketing channels
(i.e. the means by which a firm’s personnel communicates with its partners to affect their
behavior) in order to examine associations with the strength of buyer-seller relationships
(relationalism) and alternate governance structures (market, administrative, franchise and
corporate).

•

Special arrangements between buyers and sellers. Frazier et al. (1988) explained how
JIT exchanges compare with other forms of exchange; what conditions are most
conducive to the initiation of JIT exchanges; and what key factors influence the success
or failure of initiated JIT exchanges.

•

Heide and John (1990), drawing on a normative theory of transaction costs, identified
conditions under which alliances in industrial purchasing are useful. Results support the
model wherein it is posited that the utility of the relationships is derived from an ability
to safeguard relationship-specific investments and to facilitate adaptation to uncertainty.

•

Noordewier et al. (1990) demonstrated that performance in terms of acquisitions costs is
enhanced when, under conditions of uncertainty, firms introduce more relational elements
in their purchasing arrangements.

•

Handfield (1993) proposed a model using resource dependence to explain how and why
purchasing is moving towards JIT. Results support the idea that purchasing departments

JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING VOL. 11 NO. 3/4 1996

23

<-----Page 17----->in make-to-order firms are likely to reduce the number of critical suppliers in response to
uncertainty in demand.
•

Swift and Coe (1994) examined single and multiple sourcing of products. A sourcing
preference scale is developed to measure purchasing manager’s attitudes towards either
single or multiple sourcing. Differences in selected demographic and organizational
characteristics between purchasing managers having preference for single and multiple
