Abstract
Process-tracing
approaches
to the study of decision making usually involve analysis of
verbal protocols or information
board measures. This article draws a parallel between the
decision-making
research
and the general field of problem solving with respect to the
analysis of think-aloud protocols. A literature review is given of the types of analyses used in
studies on decision making in which think-aloud protocols were collected. Results indicate
that only four of the twenty-three
decision studies involve the construction
of process
models such as are common in problem-solving
research.
Possible objections
against
think-aloud data are discussed and the construction
and use of process models in decisionmaking research is illustrated
by means of an information
display board task in which
subjects were asked to think aloud. Similarities and dissimilarities
between decision making
and general problem solving and their implications for the construction
of process models
are discussed.

1. Introduction
Most research devoted to the identification
of strategies underlying
a multi-attribute decision or judgment
belongs to one of two main research
paradigms:
structural
modeling
or process tracing (Ford et al., 1989; Billings and Marcus,
1983; Abelson
and Levi, 198.5; Westenberg
and Koele, 1994). In the structural
modeling
approach
a subject’s judgment
strategy is investigated
by finding a
mathematical
function that shows a good fit on the relation between the provided
information
(the stimuli) on the one hand and the judgments
(the outcomes) on
the other hand. This function is considered
to be an adequate description
of the
way judgments
are made.

In the process-tracing
approach the focus is on the process itself and not on the
relation between stimuli and outcomes of the decision process. Data are gathered
during this process in order to reveal the train of thought leading to a final
decision (Svenson,
1979). The process-tracing
techniques
originate
from human
problem-solving
research (cf. Payne, 1976) and the most frequently
applied techniques are the information
board and the collection
of verbal protocols.
It has
been argued that process-tracing
techniques
are more suitable for the study of
decision processes because, in contrast to structural modeling techniques,
they can
produce more detailed,
explanatory
models of decision behavior
(Payne, 1976;
Payne et al., 1078).
Such models can be compared with the process models that are frequently used
in problem-solving
research on the basis of think-aloud
protocols as descriptions
of
cognitive processes (see e.g. Newell and Simon, 1972; VanLehn,
1989; Anderson,
1989). A process model describes how the process goes from an initial state of
knowledge through a sequence of states of knowledge to a particular
goal state.
When such a model is given data as input it produces a particular
output in the
way the process under study is supposed to be.
In this article we will focus on the construction
of such process models on the
basis of think-aloud
protocol
data for the description
of individual
decision
processes.
In the next section we will review the studies on individual
decision
behavior
that used think-aloud
protocols
as data. It will be demonstrated
that
process models are seldomly
constructed
in these studies. There are several
possible reasons for this finding. First, there may be scepticism about the usefulness of think-aloud
protocols as data. We will discuss the main objections
against
the use of verbal reports in the subsequent
section. Second, researchers
in the area
of decision making may be unfamiliar
with the derivation
of process models from
verbal protocols. Therefore
we will illustrate
how a process model can be constructed
and analysed
by means of an example of a multi-attribute
decision
problem. Third, decision-making
research may be less suitable for the derivation of
process models than problem-solving
research.
In the last section we will argue
that, notwithstanding
the existing differences
between decision making and problem solving, process models are suitable for the description
of decision processes
as well.

2. Decision

studies

using

think-aloud

protocols

Sources for the literature
search included a computerized
search of Psychological Abstracts,
and the references
given in major articles like Ford et al. (1989).
Several criteria were used in this search. First, we restricted the review to studies
on individual
decision processes,
thus excluding studies on group decision processes. Second, we included only those studies that involved well-defined
multi-attribute decision problems, so studies that involved decision problems merely in the
form of open questions were excluded. Third, only studies that used think-aloud
protocols
as verbal data were included,
because in our opinion other types of

<-----Page 2----->J.M. Harte et al. /Acta Psychologica 87 (1994) 95-120

97

verbal data, such as retrospective
protocol data or interviews, are not suitable for
the derivation
of process models. Fourth,
unpublished
manuscripts
were not
included.
We found twenty-three
studies that met these criteria. Table 1 presents
an
overview of these studies, which are summarized
by a brief description
of the
purpose of the study, and the method(s) of analysing the protocols. In addition, we
coded the studies with respect to the abstraction
level of the theory and the
segmentation
level of the protocol.
Abstraction leuel of the theory refers to the specificity of the hypotheses tested in
the study. Think-aloud
protocols can be used not only for generating
and testing
detailed process models but also for testing more abstract theoretical
generalizations (Ericsson
and Simon, 1993): the hypothesis
regarding
a certain cognitive
process can be confirmed
or rejected simply by demonstrating
the presence or
absence of certain information
in the subject’s verbalizations.
We distinguished
three abstraction
levels of the theory, namely, in order of decreasing
abstraction:
“non-sequence”,
“sequence”,
and “process
model”.
A study testing abstract
if the hypotheses
concerned
only nonhypotheses was coded as “non-sequence”
sequential
characteristics
of the process, and it was coded as “sequence”
if the
hypotheses
involved the sequential
order in which certain process characteristics
model” when it involved the
would appear. A study was coded as “process
construction
of a full process model which simulated
the decision process and
reproduced
the decision outcome.
Segmentation level of the protocol refers to the size of the parts into which the
think-aloud
protocol is divided before the analysis. The coded segmentation
levels,
ordered
from coarse to fine, were “whole protocol”,
“fragments”,
and “statements”. A study was coded as “whole protocol” if the protocol was not divided at
all, for example when a subject’s whole protocol was categorized
after inspection
by the researcher, which may be sufficient in the case of analysis on a very abstract
level. A study was coded as “fragments”
if only a few parts of the protocol were
used, which can be the case when the purpose of the study is to investigate
whether or not certain information
is used during the process. A study was coded
as “statements”
if the protocols were segmented
into the finest size. Statements
are meaningful
components
of utterances which can be recognised in speech by the
relatively long pauses that separate them. This fine segmentation
level is necessary
if the purpose of the study is to compare the protocols with a process model.
Sometimes
it is useful to analyse the protocols by first aggregating
a few statements. For example, if a number of statements
together refer to the execution of a
clear-cut part of the process as described by the theory, this set of statements
can
be aggregated
into one piece of data. This way of aggregating
data, called
aggregation by processes, and several others are described by Ericsson and Simon
(1993).
Four studies used the coarsest level of segmentation;
the decision strategies
were deduced
after examination
of the whole protocol. (Olshavsky,
1979, first
analysis; Isen and Means, 1983, second analysis; Wang, 1990, second analysis;
Ranyard and Abdel-Nabi,
1993). The descriptions
of strategies in these studies all
involved some sequential
elements.

Only one study used fragments of the verbal protocols (Payne, 1976). Conclusions about the decision processes
drawn from information
display board data
were illustrated with a few excerpts from the verbal protocols.
Twenty-one
studies used (also) the finest level of segmentation,
namely statements. Eleven of these studies were coded as “non-sequence”
(Olshavsky,
1979,
second analysis; Herstein,
1981; Fidler, 1983; Isen and Means, 1983, first analysis;
Johnson
and Meyer, 1984; Svenson
and Karlsson,
1986; Ranyard,
1987, first
analysis; Maule, 1989, both analyses; Tyszka, 1989; Wang, 1990, first analysis; Biggs
et al., 1993, second analysis). With the exception of the studies of Herstein
and
Wang, these studies tested hypotheses
about the decision
process in several
experimental
conditions
by comparing descriptive statistics derived from the statements. In most cases, these statistics were the frequencies
of statements
assigned
to certain coding categories.
Herstein
(1981) used descriptive
statistics based on
statements
in another
way, namely as predictors
of the final decision.
These
predictors were combined with other nonverbal
data in order to construct a model.
Although this model provides a description
of the decision process, the sequence
of the verbal data was disregarded
during the analysis. Therefore,
this study was
coded as “non-sequence”
also. Wang (1990, first analysis) performed
factor analysis on the frequencies
of the coding categories in order to find basic factors and
cognitive operators in the decision-making
process.
Eight of the studies using statements
were coded as “sequence”.
Five of them
compared frequencies
of statements
across different parts of the protocol, in order
to test hypotheses about the sequence of events in the process (Bettman and Park,
1980; Svenson, 1983, 1989; Butcher and Scofield, 1984; Montgomery
and Svenson,
1989). In two studies (Biggs et al., 1985; Ranyard,
1987, second analysis) the
position in the protocols of certain types of statements
were used to classify the
decision strategies of the subjects. In Biggs et al. (1993, first analysis) the amount
of information
used and pattern of information
acquisition
(similar to the index
introduced
by Payne, 1976) derived from verbal protocol data and from information search data were compared to determine
the completeness
of the think-aloud
protocols.
Four of the studies using statements
were coded as “process model”. Process
models appeared
to be constructed
on the basis of think-aloud
data only in the
studies of Payne et al. (1978), Einhorn et al. (1979), Svenson (1985) and Johnson et
al. (1991).
In conclusion,
it will be clear from the above that only a minority (17%) of the
think-aloud
studies in decision making reviewed here developed process models, in
spite of the fact that the great majority of the studies (91%) divide the think-aloud
protocols up into the fine segmentation
level of statements,
which is pre-eminently
suitable
for generating
and testing process models. Obviously,
all methods
of
analysing verbal data described
above can yield valuable
information
about the
decision process. Nevertheless,
it is surprising to observe that process models are
constructed
seldom,
especially
when taking
into consideration
decision
researchers’ growing interest in the thread of the decision process, and the ability of
process models to yield detailed descriptions
of this process.

3. Objections

against think-aloud

protocols

103

as data

Many researchers
have been reluctant
to use verbal protocol
analysis as a
source of data. This may partly be attributed
to the fact that verbal protocol
analysis is quite often confused with the method of introspection
(as was applied
by for example Titchener).
There is, however, a fundamental
difference between
these methods (Payne et al., 1978; Svenson,
1989). In verbal protocol analysis
subjects are naive with respect to the theoretical
constructs of interest and are not
requested
to theorize
but are asked to report what they are thinking
while
performing
the task. The method of introspection,
on the other hand, requires
well-trained
subjects who are asked to theorize about their own thoughts. In short,
introspection
subjects are asked to interpret
their thoughts themselves,
whereas
think-aloud
subjects are asked to avoid any of such interpretations.
Nevertheless,
there still are a few important
issues to be considered
with respect to the validity
of verbal protocol data, which we shall discuss below.
Can cognitive processes be verbalized at all?
Clearly not all processes taking place in our head can be verbalized.
There are
several factors that determine
the verbalizability
of the process: cognitive penetrability, level of automation,
and content of information.
The notion of cognitive penetrability,
developed by Pylyshyn (19891, concerns
the distinction
between the “machinery”
of a cognitive system and the information
that is processed by this machinery.
The machinery
itself cannot be observed or
altered by cognitive means. Only the information
residing in it can be observed,
altered, or verbalized.
For example, we cannot increase or reduce the capacity of
working memory and we cannot observe or influence the way in which information
is retrieved from long-term memory.
A task can be performed
automatically
or by actual problem solving or decision
making. The level of automation
is determined
by the experience
of the subject
with the task. A subject may gain experience during the course of the experiment,
or even already possess this experience prior to the experiment.
As the degree of
practice increases, the intermediate
steps of the cognitive process will be shorter.
In the extreme case the think-aloud
protocol of an expert might even contain only
the final result.
Finally, the content of the information
processed may be difficult to verbalize
because the task involves visual information.
In these cases the thoughts require
oral encoding before they can be reported which may make thinking aloud more
difficult and can result in incomplete
protocols.
Are the cognitive processes

affected

by the think-aloud

procedure?

The notion that cognitive processes are affected by the think-aloud
procedure is
called reactivity.
Ericsson
and Simon (1984, 1993) reviewed the literature
on
reactivity of the think-aloud
method and concluded
that thinking aloud tends to

<-----Page 9----->104

J.M. Harte et al. /Acta

Psychologica X7 (1994) 95-120

slow down the process but does not change the sequence of thoughts during the
process. The authors based their conclusion
on studies that compare properties of
cognitive
processes
with and without
concurrently
thinking
aloud. The extra
verbalization
activity accounts for the difference
in time. Because of this need for
more time, it is recommended
not to collect think-aloud
data during tasks that are
to be performed
under time pressure:
thinking
aloud will interfere
with the
performance
of the task, thus resulting in incomplete
protocols or in altered ways
of performing
the task.
In a study by Russo et al. (1989) thinking
aloud appeared
to influence
the
accuracy of performance
of the task. However,
Biggs et al. (1993), who also
investigated
the effect of reactivity, found that verbalization
had effect only on the
time needed to complete
the task. Ericsson
and Simon (1993) argue that the
differences
with respect to accuracy found by Russo et al. may be due to the
experimental
procedure
used in that study.
The whole experimental
setting of a think-aloud
session may of course influence
the cognitive processes but in this respect the think-aloud
method is quite comparable to all more or less intrusive measurement
methods.
Do think-aloud protocols
actual thought processes?

constructions

When a subject gives a concurrent
think-aloud
protocol, the protocol is a report
of the thought process. Although
think-aloud
protocols
may suffer from minor
errors, which are common in human speech production,
there are no indications
that think-aloud
protocols contain information
made up by the subjects. In their
literature
overviews, Ericsson and Simon (1984, 1993) conclude that serious problems occur only if there is room for interpretation
or forgetting. This is the case
when there is time between the actual cognitive process and the verbalization
of
the process,
as in introspection,
where substantial
interpretation
of thoughts
before giving the reports is part of the method, and as in retrospective
reports,
where subjects are asked how they performed
the task afterwards.
Is it possible to interpret protocols

reliably?

Analysis
of think-aloud
protocols
requires
objective
coding procedures:
the
interpretation
of a protocol
must not depend
on the person who codes the
protocols. This objectivity can be promoted by having at least two persons coding
the protocols and determine
the inter-judge
reliability. We will return to this point
in the next section.

In order to be sure that these
it is useful to conduct a pilot study beforehand.
Furthermore,

with respect to the analysis of think-aloud
protocols,
several judges interprete
the same protocols.

4. Constructing

and analysing

it is recommended

105

to have

process models

In cognitive psychology, a process model comprises two components:
knowledge
and architecture.
Knowledge refers to the knowledge people bring with them when
they perform the task. The architecture
is derived from psychological
knowledge
about the architecture
of the human mind. In this section we will explain how a
process model is usually constructed
and analysed in the field of problem solving,
and how this procedure
can be applied in the field of decision making. We
distinguish
seven steps, which are summarized
below:
(1) Task analysis: modeling the way(s) in which the task can be performed.
(2) Construction
of a psychological
model: this model predicts how people will
behave, and is obtained by applying psychological
knowledge about the architecture of the human mind to the task analysis.
(3) Construction
of a coding scheme: such a scheme describes how the processes
hypothesized
in the psychological model will appear as text in the protocol, and
it is obtained by operationalizing
the psychological
model.
(4) Collection of protocols: registration
of subjects’ verbalization
of thoughts while
performing
the task.
(5) Segmentation
of protocols: dividing protocols into smaller parts.
(6) Coding of protocols: applying the coding scheme to the segmented
protocols.
(7) Comparison
of the coded protocols with predictions
from the psychological
model.
Each of these steps will be discussed here separately and illustrated by means of
an example of a multi-attribute
decision problem. The example is taken from a
typical information
board experiment.
Subjects were asked which bank they would
prefer when they were to open an account. Six banks, labeled ‘A’ up to ‘F’, were
each described
in terms of six attributes:
credit facility, customer-friendliness,
number of cash-dispensers
in town, rate of interest of the account, familiarity with
the bank, distance from home. The aspects of the banks, i.e. the particular values
of the banks on these attributes,
were expressed in terms of a ten-point
scale. All
task information
was presented
by means of a computerized
information
display
board: a matrix with the banks arranged along the left side and the attributes along
the top side, each matrix cell containing
one aspect, i.e. the value of one bank on
one attribute.
Initially the aspects in the cells are hidden, but they can be made
visible by clicking with the computer
mouse on a desired cell. In this way, the
subject’s order of search for information
can be traced.
The usual analysis procedure
in such an information
display board experiment
is to derive several search variables on the basis of the subjects’ search process,
such as Variability of search and Pattern of search (see Payne, 1976; Billings and

<-----Page 11----->106

Scherer, 1988). Variability

deviation
of the proportion
of aspects
examined
per alternative
within the set of alternatives.
Examining
a constant
number
of aspects of each alternative
(standard
deviation
of zero) indicates
a
compensatory
strategy, and examining
a variable number of aspects indicates
a
noncompensatory
strategy. Pattern of search is defined as the number of alternativewise moves minus the number of attributewise
moves, divided by the sum of
these two numbers.
Thus a negative pattern score indicates mainly attributewise
search, while a positive score indicates mainly alternativewise
search. Although the
main topic of this article is the use of process models in decision-making
research,
these common information
board measures
will be calculated
also, in order to
make a comparison
between the two methods.
Step 1: Task analysis

Constructing
process models is a difficult task which can be simplified
by
starting with a rational task analysis. This is a first approximation
of the process
model to be constructed,
based on a rational
method for performing
the task,
without taking into account too many psychological
aspects. Task analysis involves
structuring
of the task and a first conceptualization
of the possible way(s) to solve
the problem.
To formulate
these solutions
we need to know what knowledge
people use when performing
the task, for example as a result of their experience,
or task instructions.
In short, task analysis consists of formalizing (a) the structure
of the task, (b) the rational way(s) in which the problem can be solved, and (c) the
task-relevant
knowledge that we expect or know people to have.
In the general field of problem solving, a wide variety of reasoning mechanisms,
methods, and strategies have been developed
that can be used for task analysis.
These will provide a good first approximation
of the model. In the field of
multi-attribute
decision
making, accordingly,
we may think of the well-known
decision
strategies
formulated
in the decision-making
literature
(e.g. Svenson,
1979).
We performed
task analysis for our example as follows. All multi-attribute
decision
problems
have the same basic task structure in common,
involving
alternatives,
attributes,
and aspects. As rational ways to solve the problem we took
as points of departure
four decision strategies that are of particular
interest for
information
display board experiments
like our example
since each of them
corresponds
to a specific search mode, i.e. combination
of Pattern and Variability,
as was suggested by Payne (1976): the linear strategy (alternativewise,
constant),
variable),
the elimination-by-aspects
the conjunctive
strategy
(alternativewise,
strategy (attributewise,
variable),
and the additive difference
strategy (attributewise, constant). The strategies can be summarized
as follows:
Linear:

Integrate
the aspects of each alternative
into an
overall value. Choose the alternative
with the highest overall value.

<-----Page 12----->J.M. Harte et al. /Acta Psychologica 87 (1994) 95-120

Conjunctive:

Elimination-by-aspects:

Additive

difference:

107

Reject all alternatives
with aspects that do not meet
a minimum
threshold
on one of the attributes.
Choose the remaining
alternative.
Reject all alternatives
with aspects that do not meet
a minimum threshold, starting with the most important attribute. Choose the remaining
alternative.
Evaluate the difference between two alternatives
on
each attribute
and sum them up. Choose the alternative with the largest positive sum difference.

It must be remarked
here that there are more than these four strategies that
correspond
to certain search modes in information
display boards. The reason we
confine
ourselves
here to these four strategies
is that in experiments
using
information
display boards these have been the strategies investigated
most frequently.
Closer examination
of the conjunctive
strategy and the elimination-by-aspect
strategy reveals that, dependent
on the height of the threshold employed, a strict
application
of these strategies does not always yield exactly ~lze best alternative,
which is the goal of the task. If the threshold
is too low, several alternatives
remain, and if the threshold is too high, none of the alternatives
remain. In these
instances, strictly following these strategies can lead to one best alternative
only if
the thresholds are adjusted.
The additive difference
strategy was suggested by Tversky (1969) for binary
choices. Since our example concerns more than two alternatives,
we will follow
Payne’s (1976) adaptation
of the additive difference strategy to decision problems
with more than two alternatives,
which implies that the procedure is repeated with
the chosen and a new alternative
until all alternatives
are evaluated.
’
We constructed
a model for each decision strategy as applied to the banking
problem, the models are shown in Fig. 1. The principle of threshold adjustment
was incorporated
in the conjunctive
model and the elimination-by-aspects
model,
and the additive difference model was adapted to the situation with more than two
alternatives.
The models in Fig. 1 are formulated
in terms of a pseudo-programming language. A process model is always represented
in the form of a more or
less formal language. The languages used most frequently are conceptual
modeling
languages,
production
rules, problem-behavior-graphs
and pseudo-programming
languages (see Van Someren et al., 1994). A discussion of these formal languages
is beyond the scope of this article, which purpose is to illustrate the use of process

’ It should be mentioned
here that the additive difference
strategy when adapted as above to the
case of more than two alternatives
and more than two attributes,
leads to a mainly attributewise
opening
of the cells only in the case of less than four alternatives.
Only then the number
of
attributewise
moves exceeds the number of alternativewise
moves, otherwise
the additive difference
strategy leads to a mainly alternativewise
search mode, in spite of the atributewise
processing
of
information.

models in the field of decision making. For the sake of brevity, we confine our
example to a pseudo-programming
language.
In the models, each decision strategy is supplemented
with the task-relevant
knowledge we expect subjects to bring with them: we expect, for example, that
people will not apply the rational
strategies
to all attributes,
but only to the
attributes
they consider to be relevant on the basis of their experience with banks.
In the same way, subjects may bring their own knowledge in the form of individual
subjective levels of acceptance
(thresholds)
on an attribute, which in addition may
change during the decision process.
Step 2: Construction

of a psychological

model

A psychological
model is obtained
by adding architectural
aspects to the task
analysis, i.e. by applying psychological
knowledge about the cognitive machinery, in
particular
the cognitive
constraints,
to the task analysis. In other words, the
psychological
model predicts how people do behave when performing
the task,
whereas the task analysis describes the various behaviors that can occur.
The architecture
consists of a working memory and a long-term
memory. The
working memory has a limited capacity: it can handle five to eight information
items simultaneously.
Information
can be stored from working memory
into
long-term memory. Vice versa, information
can be put back into working memory

<-----Page 14----->J.M. Harte et al. /Acta Psychologica 87 (1991) 95-120

109

by retrieving
it from long-term
memory. These long-term
memory operations,
storage and retrieval,
are relatively slow and also error prone. A faster way of
putting information
into working memory is by reading it via a sensory buffer from
a so-called
external memory, for example when a scratch-pad
is used. These
processes can be so fast that the external memory functions
as an extension
of
working memory. In our example, the information
display board may well function
as such an external memory. The information
items in working memory can be
changed also by manipulation
of the items themselves, for example by inferences.
We applied this architectural
knowledge to the task analysis where we thought
it to be relevant. The conjunctive
strategy, the elimination-by-aspect
strategy, and
the additive-difference
strategy were considered
to yield no problems with respect
to the capacity of working memory: there is not any moment
in the decision
process where subjects have to hold more than six items at the same time. The
linear strategy, on the other hand, was expected to yield cognitive overload. At a
certain moment the subject has to hold too many items in working memory, namely
when evaluating
the fourth alternative:
the three evaluations
of the already
processed
alternatives,
and the six aspects of the fourth alternative.
However,
because the information
display board may function as an external memory, this
problem may arise not until the processing of the fifth or even sixth alternative.
We incorporated
this in the model by assuming that people who use a linear
strategy do follow this strategy until they experience
cognitive overload. If that is
the case, they will proceed by holding in working memory only the alternatives
with
evaluations
that pass a certain threshold. This means that in the second step of the
linear strategy one line has to be inserted:
IF (#banks
evaluated + #relevant
attributes > 6) THEN test whether alternative > threshold.
Step 3: Construction of a coding scheme
A coding scheme is an operationalization
of the psychological model that relates
the psychological
model to the text of the think-aloud
protocols.
The coding
scheme describes how each hypothesized
subprocess in the model will appear in
the protocol. This must be done in such a way that coders who do not know the
context can recognise protocol fragments as instances of processes hypothesized
in
the model. The specificity of the coding scheme must correspond
to the specificity
of the model on the one hand and the level of segmentation
of the protocol on the
other. It is essential
that the coding scheme is objective
in the sense that it
produces the same interpretations
regardless of the person applying it. Usually, it
is necessary to train the coders how to use the coding scheme and to evaluate its
reliability.
The four models are different with respect to the cognitive activities undertaken
or, in terms of problem solving, with respect to the operators
that are applied in
order to go from one state of knowledge to the next state of knowledge.
Huber
(1986, 19891, who treats decision
making as an instance
of problem
solving,
identified several operators specific for the solution of decision problems. Some of
these operators
involve the evaluation
of an element
against some internal
or

<-----Page 15----->J.M. Harte rt al. /Acta

I IO

Psychologica

87 (1994)

95-120

external standard of attractiveness,
others involve comparing or combining
two or
more elements.
An element
can be an aspect as well as an alternative
or an
attribute. We constructed
a coding scheme for our example consisting of evaluative
operators,
comparative
operators,
combining
operators,
and information
acquisition operators. The coding scheme is shown in Table 2. The operators EVAL, SAT
TEST, MAT TEST, MAX, and DIFF are derived from some of the operators
defined by Huber.
The sequence of coded predictions
from the psychological
models constructed
in the former step are shown in Fig. 2. A difference
between decision problems
and general problems is that they are ill-defined.
There is more than one possible
goal state, depending
on the subjective values of the decision maker with respect to
the importance
of attributes
and the evaluation
of aspects. As a consequence,
the
sequence of coded predictions
cannot be too specific. Still, the four models can be
distinguished
from one another.
Step 4: Collection

of protocols

Think aloud protocols are gathered by asking subjects to talk aloud about what
is going on in their mind while performing
the main task. The quality of the
obtained
protocols
is to a large extent dependent
on the instructions
of the
experimenter
and the entire experimental
setting. For advice on instructions
and
experimental
settings for think-aloud
experiments
we refer to Svenson (1989), Van
Someren et al. (1994), and Ericsson and Simon (1984, 1993).
Step 5: Segmentation

of protocols

In most cases, the verbal report of the subject is tape-recorded
and subsequently
transcribed.
As explained
in the introduction,
the protocols are segmented
into
smaller parts; the level of segmentation
depends on the purpose of the study.
For our example we tape-recorded,
transcribed,
and segmented
into statements
the think-aloud
protocols of two subjects. The segmented
protocols are shown in
Fig. 3.
Step 6: Coding of protocols
The protocols can now be coded by means of the coding scheme. Coding the
protocols implies that each statement
in the protocol is assigned one of the coding
categories from the model. To ascertain that the coding scheme is objective, the
coding should be done by at least two coders so that the inter-judge
reliability can
be determined,
by calculating kappa (Cohen, 1960) or Fleiss’s (1971) generalization
of Cohen’s kappa for the case of more than two raters. A detailed discussion of
interjudge
reliability
aspects and measures can be found in Van Someren et al.
(1994).
The statements
of the two protocols in Fig. 3 were coded by three coders using
the coding scheme in Table 2. During this coding it appeared that it was not always

clear whether the categories
READ, EVAL, or INTEG should be assigned to a
particular
statement.
In a few cases it seemed as if the subject attended to aspects
and converted them into a subjective value almost simultaneously.
In order to solve
this problem the coding READ + EVAL was sometimes used (Statements
18, 19,
25, 26, 27, 29 and 30 of Subject 2).
The agreement between the three coders was determined
by calculating Cohen’s
generalized
kappa (Fleiss, 1971) and was very high: 0.97 for the first protocol and
0.82 for the second protocol.
The three coders discussed
each difference
and
decided on the most suitable coding category. The final codings of the statements
are also displayed in Fig. 3.

the psychological

Now the coded protocols can be compared with the processes as predicted by
the model. If all coded statements
of the protocol and their sequence
are in
perfect accordance
with the model, it can be concluded
that the model is a good
description
of the process. However, such a good fit will seldom be found. There
may be important
events in the protocols that were not predicted by the model, or
the model contains
elements
that never occur in the coded protocol,
or the
sequence
of events in the protocol is systematically
different
from that in the
model.

Quantifying
the fit of sequential
models, including
the process models, is
difficult because, unfortunately,
there is no error theory available and there are no
standard
techniques
that give a quantitative
measure for the degree of fit. This
means that a less satisfying solution has to be accepted. It may be possible, for
example, to define measures based on uncodable vs. codable and unpredicted

missing) vs. predicted statements.

When comparing
the coded protocol of the first subject with the codings
predicted by the models as displayed in Fig. 2, it appears that the decision strategy
of this subject is very similar to the linear model. Not exactly in accordance
with
the model prediction,
however, is the sequence of the codings READ, EVAL, and
INTEG. The linear model predicts reading, evaluating and integrating
per alternative, whereas the coded statements
indicate that the subject first read the aspects
of four banks and only then evaluated
these aspects. However, as was discussed
above, the assignment
of these coding categories
was not always unambiguous
since now and then these operations
seemed to be executed almost simultaneously.
Therefore we decided to aggregate the respective statements
into a broad READ
+ EVAL + INTEG (RED coding category. As a result, an almost perfect predicted sequence appeared, as can be seen in the last column of Fig. 3. One striking
difference emerged from the comparison
of these two sequences:
the part of the
process just after the selection by means of the MAT-test. According to the model
the alternative with the highest subjective value should be selected at this moment.
Our subject, however, gathered more information
by selecting a few new attributes
before making his final choice.
The coded protocol of the second subject shows most resemblance
with the
additive difference model because of the repetitive choice between pairs of banks.
After selecting the most important
attributes the subject took the first two banks,
A en B, and chose the most attractive one. Subsequently,
he compared the chosen
bank with the next bank and chose the most attractive
one of this pair. This
procedure
was repeated until all banks were considered.
However, in most cases
the basis on which the subject made these binary choices appeared
to be rather
different from that of the additive difference model. The predicted transformation
of aspects of two alternatives
into a subjective difference value (DIFF) was applied
only once, namely when comparing bank A and B in Statement
14. Otherwise, a
kind of threshold test (SAT TEST) was used, or merely evaluative operators.

5. Discussion
In the above we illustrated
how think-aloud
data and process models can be
used to identify decision strategies
in a specific decision task: the information
display board. There are several advantages of using process models in comparison
to the usual information
board method of analysis.
First, process models can help to overcome an awkward interpretation
problem
in the usual method of analysis: the inductive step from search modes to decision
strategies. If subjects use one of the four decision strategies described above, they
will show the corresponding
search mode. However, as mentioned
above, one
cannot argue the other way around: if a certain search mode is found, the subject
might have used this particular
strategy, but he or she may have used another
strategy or combination
of strategies as well, yielding the same search mode. The
use of process models can help to overcome this interpretation
problem,
since
deviations
from the strategies or combinations
of strategies can be determined.

<-----Page 21----->116

J.M. Harte et (11./Acta Psychologica 87 (1994) 95-120

According
to the usual information
board method,
Variability
and Pattern
of
search would have been calculated on the basis of the opened cells. The strategy of
the first subject would then have been described as a variable, mainly alternativewise search mode (see Fig. A.1 in the Appendix) and categorized
as a conjunctive
strategy instead of a linear strategy. The second subject’s strategy would have been
described
as a constant,
mainly attributewise
search mode (see Fig. A.11 and
classified as an additive difference
strategy. The latter is in accordance
with the
results of the protocol analysis. However, we would jump to conclusions
by stating
that the two methods yield convergent
results in this case because, as was noted
above, a strict application
of the additive difference strategy in decision problems
with more than three alternatives
actually would result in a constant, but mainly
alternativewise
(positive) Pattern of search, just as the conjunctive
strategy.
Second, process models provide a solution to the acquisition-versus-processing
matter. The usual information
board indices are based on the order in which the
cells are opened; the order in which the information
is actually processed is not
elicitated. In our example, the protocol analyses identified information
acquisition
and information
processing as separate parts of the decision process. Both protocols revealed that in a few cases the information
in the cells was not processed
until all relevant cells were opened and that the order in which the information
was processed was different from the order in which it was acquired.
The use of process models enables
a detailed
description
of the decision
process. But as demonstrated
in the introduction,
in decision research the occurrence of process models in the analysis of think-aloud
protocols
is a rarity,
especially in comparison
to the common use of them in general problem-solving
research. This may be considered
a remarkable
difference,
since the experimental
tasks in both types of research are much alike: the decision process can well be
defined as a search process from an initial state of knowledge to a certain desired
goal state of knowledge, which is the common definition of the solution process in
general problem solving.
The registration
of think-aloud
protocols is time-consuming,
and the construction of a process model can be complicated.
In using this method, one can be faced
with various difficulties:
the question of how to model random effects like differences in behavior between people or within a single person, how to determine
the
degree of specificity of the model and when to decide whether the fit of the model
to the data is satisfactory or not. Because there are no clear guide-lines
handling
these problems, the researcher
is forced to make ad hoc decisions when constructing the process model and analysing
the think-aloud
data. In spite of these
difficulties,
this method is widespread
in problem-solving
research, and the question arises whether there is something special to decision problems that makes it
too difficult to apply this method.
The major difference seems to concern the nature of the desired goal state. In
problem-solving
studies, subjects are presented
with problems that have one (or
more) logically correct solutions.
In decision research, on the other hand, there
often is no correct solution: the desired goal state is heavily dependent
on the
subject’s subjective values. In many decision problems there simply is no single

Psychologica 87 (1994) 95-120

decision that can be identified
as the objectively
correct one. This is the main
reason why many decision researchers
prefer to speak of “optimal”
decisions
rather than “correct” decisions.
This difference
has implications
for the usual procedure
for constructing
process models, more specifically, for the rational task analysis. Task analysis involves
formalization
of the task structure, the rational ways to solve the problem, and the
knowledge subjects bring with them. In problem-solving
research, the emphasis is
on defining the rational ways to come to a correct solution. In decision-making
research,
where the correct solution
is not so clear-cut,
this can be done by
defining possible decision strategies leading to an optimal decision. The decisionmaking literature provides a variety of formulated
decision strategies (e.g. Svenson,
1979; Payne, 1976, 1982). All these strategies are based on the assumption
that
people use subjective values. For example, as in our example, people have their
own ideas about which attributes
are important
and which are not. In fact, this
type of subjectivity can be seen as the knowledge subjects bring to the task. As a
consequence,
in decision-making
research, the emphasis in task analysis may well
be more on the formalization
of knowledge than is the case in problem-solving
research. In short, the subjectivity comprised by the desired goal state in decision
problems does not cause insuperable
difficulties.
We believe that the development
of process models can be useful in decisionmaking research
for several reasons.
First, when a process model has been
constructed
successfully,
this model has much more explanatory
power than
models derived by other methods of research, because it provides detailed predictions about individual
decisions and the process leading to the decision. Second,
process models contain
detailed
hypotheses
about the knowledge
involved in
cognitive processes.
Third, the construction
of a process models requires
the
elucidation
of all relevant
information
about the decision task. Experience
in
cognitive psychology has shown that this tends to pay off because the structure of
the task and the knowledge that people bring up are the best explanatory factors of
responses on many tasks.
