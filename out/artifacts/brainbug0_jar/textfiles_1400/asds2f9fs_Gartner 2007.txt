This article is an introduction to a special issue on entrepreneurial narrative that provides
theoretical and empirical links between scholarship in narrative and entrepreneurship as well as
demonstrates how theories and methods in narrative may be applied to the study of entrepreneurship
as a phenomenon. A conjecture that narrative perspectives might lead to a “science of the
imagination” is offered.

1. Executive summary
This article is an introduction to a special issue on entrepreneurial narrative. A simple
definition of narrative approaches is: an analysis of the stories that people tell. The special
issue consists of seven articles. The first article is Terry Allen's story, told in 1984, or how
he started a toy store, in Rutland, Vermont, in 1965. The Toy Store(y) serves as the basis for
six articles that apply narrative approaches.
The goal of the special issue on entrepreneurial narrative is to provide theoretical and
empirical links between scholarship in narrative and entrepreneurship as well as
demonstrate how theories and methods in narrative may be applied to the study of
entrepreneurship as a phenomenon. Narrative approaches and narrative methodologies are

reflexive, that is, in the process of analyzing other people's stories, we, as researchers, are
also looking into the mirror of our own stories of how and why our research is conducted.
To describe how and why the articles in this special issue analyzed a particular story told by
an entrepreneur, from a reflexive point of view, a discussion of the evolution of this special
issue is offered, and reasons are provided for why the Toy Store(y) in particular, serves as
the focus of these narrative analyses.
This introduction is not a summary of the articles in the special issue. Rather, the
introduction points out three broad insights that seem to characterize all six narrative
analyses: (1) Stories are never complete, in and of themselves. Stories are told in a particular
context, to particular listeners, by a particular story teller, for particular purposes. When a
story is subject to various narrative approaches, a variety of insights can be gained as to
what is really being said and why, as well as what wasn't said which might be. (2) Stories
are told in the larger context of other stories and ideas: “larger voices.” To listen/read a story
offers an opportunity to engage in how a story interrelates to other “larger voices” that
readers/listeners bring with them. To call upon these “larger voices” through narrative
approaches has value analytically and creatively. (3) Narrative approaches come with their
own epistemology, theories, and methods that must be met on their own terms. As this
occurs, narrative approaches will play an increasing role in entrepreneurship scholarship.
Readers of the six entrepreneurial narratives might be skeptical of articles where, at
points in their development, there is an allowance for “fiction.” That is, when there are
“unknowns” in the knowledge of specific “facts as given,” the authors of these narrative
analyses are likely to provide “facts as made.” There might be a fear that narrative
approaches might lead to taking normative paradigmatic scholarship down the rabbit hole
of treating all knowledge as “fiction.” This is not actually the case, and rather than setting up
a struggle of either/or between paradigmatic approaches and narrative approaches, their
inherent similarities are recognized as ways in which knowledge is gained through the
application of skill.
The label, “science of the imagination” is suggested as another promise for what
entrepreneurship (and specifically, entrepreneurial narrative) might offer as a contribution
to scholarship. The narrative of entrepreneurship is the generation of hypotheses about how
the world might be: how the future might look and act. The articles in this special issue not
only probe how entrepreneurs generate and modify their visions of the future, the scholars
in these articles generate and modify alternative visions of the future, as well. There is a
skill here, in these six entrepreneurial narratives, that is subtle, but very critical for
understanding how the imagination works.
This article concludes with a suggestion that narrative approaches offer ways for both
scholars and practitioners to “tell back” entrepreneurial stories. The process of “telling
back” surfaces the models we use to talk about entrepreneurship. Narrative approaches not
only uncover the models we currently use to talk about entrepreneurship, they give us new
ways to talk this phenomenon, as well.
2. Introduction
The aim of this special issue on entrepreneurial narrative is to provide theoretical
and empirical links between scholarship in narrative and entrepreneurship as well as

<-----Page 2----->W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

demonstrate how theories and methods in narrative may be applied to the study of
entrepreneurship as a phenomenon. I believe that embedded in this aspiration is a sense
that narrative approaches surface tensions in “how things are currently done” in
entrepreneurship scholarship. I will also suggest that narrative perspectives in the study
of entrepreneurship might also lead to the genesis of a science of the imagination. The
aim, then, of this special issue is rather far reaching and hitting this target requires a
certain amount of deftness, not only on the part of the authors writing for the special
issue, but, of our readers, as well. Given that a variety of readers may encounter this
special issue (i.e., experts in narrative with little knowledge of entrepreneurship, experts
in entrepreneurship with little knowledge of narrative, experts in narrative and entrepreneurship, and novices in both entrepreneurship and narrative scholarship), it was a
challenge to select papers and engage authors in revisions that met these multiple goals.
I believe that much of the tension in reading the articles in this special issue will be due to the
inherent conflict between “insiders” and others, that is, between expert specialists in specific
intellectual domains and those less knowledgeable (Davis, 1971). Demonstrating knowledge
and expertise to one group is often irrelevant or obvious to another. One of the major strength's
of the Journal of Business Venturing has been its constant admonition to scholars to translate
theories and results based on insider expertise for a larger domain of individuals (both
practitioners and scholars) with less know–how. Yet, in practice, this has meant that both sides
must stretch: the novice to undertake an effort to learn aspects of a scholar's insights and
methods, and, the expert to let go of a certain precision, nuance and language that only insiders
can see and appreciate. Otherwise, I sense, there is dissatisfaction from each end of the
continuum, and not much learning. It behooves readers, then, to bring along fewer expectations
and more alertness to the ideas, methods and insights offered in these articles.
The remainder of this article will describe: the evolving logic for how this special issue
came to be; highlight from my perspective, some of the insights and ideas posited in the
articles in this special issue; and offer some speculations about how the study of entrepreneurial narrative might provide the basis for a science of the imagination.
3. From a story to a narrative analysis
It is very easy to complicate the scholarly area that is connoted by such terms as
discourse, narrative, and story (Grant et al., 1998; Rhodes and Brown, 2005). I will offer
this rather simplistic description of what narrative approaches do: they involve analyzing
the stories that people tell. Hosking and Hjorth (2004: 265) offer a more elaborate
description:
•
•
•
•

“Story construction is a process of creating reality
in which self/story teller is clearly part of the story.
Narratives are relational realities, socially constructed, not individual subjective realities.
Narratives are situated — they are con-textualized in relation to multiple local–cultural–
historical acts/text.
• Inquiry may articulate multiple narrative and relations.
• Change-work works with multiple realities and power relations, for example, to
• facilitate ways of relating that are open to possibilities.”

There is much discussion about what a story or narrative consists of, whether all stories
are narratives or whether all narratives are stories, and any number of other conundrums that
scholars in this field can quickly mire themselves in (Grant et al., 2004). Be-that-as-it-may,
without getting quickly lost in what are, actually, important semantic issues involved with
the labels narrative scholars use to describe aspects of these types of research, narrative
approaches provide some very powerful tools for exploring what entrepreneurs (or others)
say about what they do.
If there seems to be one archetypal characteristic of narrative approaches and narrative
methodologies (e.g., Boje, 2001; Gabriel, 2004; O'Connor, 1997) that permeates this
perspective, it would be their reflexivity (Fletcher, 2007). That is, in the process of
analyzing other people's stories, we, as researchers, are also looking into the mirror of our
own stories of how and why our research is conducted on these other people's stories
(Czarniawska, 1997). To describe how and why the articles in this special issue analyzed a
particular story told by an entrepreneur, from a reflexive point of view, then, requires some
discussion of the evolution of this special issue. While this discussion might seem
egocentric, it speaks to the spirit of recognizing the importance of the context in which
narrative analyses take place.
First, it is worth noting the difficulty of describing the origin of this special issue “after
the fact.” Writing now, about the evolution of an idea that was not, at the outset, labeled as
“entrepreneurial narrative” to this outcome as a set of articles on entrepreneurial narrative
in the Journal of Business Venturing, is much of the difference suggested by Bourdrieu
(1977) between opus operatum — sense making about the process after it is over, as a
finished task, and modus operandi — sense making about the process while one is still in
it. This description is opus operatum, with much of the messiness, wrong turns, waiting,
ambiguity, and my own stupidity, ignorance and confusion-missing. Since Fletcher (2007)
also writes about how this special issue evolved, it may be well worth comparing these two
accounts.
I believe that the origin of this special issue, did, actually, begin with this initial question:
Is it the researcher, or the “data,” that makes for the generation of insights when undertaking
qualitative research? If one, for example, looks at Pitt's (1998) analysis of interview
material from two entrepreneurs, are the insights gained from his reading of these
entrepreneurs due to: the source material the two entrepreneurs provided; Pitt's process of
uncovering this source material; Pitt's analyses; or (“all of the above,” or “something else,”
and/or…)? This question is, actually, a fantasy about viewing researchers separate from their
research [i.e., “How can we know the dancer from the dance?” (Yeats, 1956)]. Yet, in my
own neurotic way (Adler, 1917), I would treat both quantitative and qualitative information
“as if” (Vaihinger, 1924/1952) they were sought, collected, interpreted and analyzed
irrespective of the researcher. What makes this question “neurotic” is treating the fiction of
“research separate from the researcher” as fact (that is, fact as “given” rather than as
“made”).1 Research (quantitative or qualitative) is not “fact as given,” yet, I continue to
hold on to this neurotic fantasy that “data” is separate from the researcher and the research
1
The author thanks Ellen O'Conner for her comments on this section and for offering Giambattista Vico's
insight that the term “fact” in Latin is “factum” which means “made.” Yet, as she points out, we now, tend to think
of “fact” as something that is “given.”

process. While I was generally aware of many scholars who had poked holes in this fantasy
(e.g., Geertz, 1988; Hatch, 1996; Van Maanen, 1988 — I offer only a few citations rather
than a comprehensive bibliography to signal my knowledge of mostly North American
writers and their sensibilities), it simply is, for me, hard to let go of this fiction. I tend to
believe that the quantitative data in the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (Gartner
et al., 2004) is “fact as given” rather than a fairly complicated social construction of the
beliefs of over 100 scholars submitting questions for a questionnaire, phone survey
specialists probing for responses, respondents interpreting these survey questions (e.g.,
“What does completing a business plan ‘in my head' mean?”) and scholars selecting
questions for analysis and interpreting their results. It was not hard for me to segue from my
fantasy that quantitative data (i.e. the PSED—that can be studied by many scholars with the
assumption that this research is separate from the researchers who created this data and
analyze it) to considering this question: What would happen if a variety of scholars studied
the same qualitative “data”? If the qualitative “data” was held constant, would we see
variation in the insights generated? If so, would the differences in insights be due to
theories, methods, or other issues idiosyncratic to the scholars, themselves?
While Hillman (1983: 111) suggests that: “To be sane we must recognize our beliefs as
fictions, and see through our hypotheses as fantasies,” I couldn't let go of this goal of
getting a number of scholars to look at the same qualitative data. My background is strongly
influenced by what might be labeled as the “Harvard approach” (Contardo and Wensley,
2004) to analyzing qualitative data as represented in the case method (Barnes et al., 1994;
Naumes and Naumes, 1999), and with many years of both creating and using cases for
teaching, and with experience with case competitions (as a writer, judge, and team sponsor),
the idea of taking qualitative data and comparing how scholars analyzed this material,
seemed an obvious and valuable exercise. And, while the Harvard Business Review in the
“Case Study” section of their magazine offers a comparative evaluation of case material
from the viewpoints of a variety of practitioners and scholars, I had not seen an academic
journal attempt to publish a series of scholarly articles analyzing the same material. This
concept, therefore, seemed worth pursuing.
While I was attending the first “Movements in Entrepreneurship” workshop in
Sweden, in June 2001, I mentioned this idea (about having a number of scholars look at
the same qualitative data) to Denise Fletcher, and suggested that I had a transcription of a
story that an entrepreneur had told me that I thought could serve as the basis for the “data”
to analyze. She indicated that the idea and story sounded intriguing, and to send her the
transcript. I did.
Now, what the previous paragraph just omits, is my recollection of another, larger
dialogue occurring between us on: the “problem” of qualitative researchers publishing
their work in North American based academic journals; the issues of validity and reliability in case research that quantitative-oriented journal reviewers seemed to have with
manuscripts that didn't have numbers; and the general lack of knowledge and interest of
most North American scholars in the history and philosophy of the science embedded in
qualitative entrepreneurship scholarship. I was, then, completing a special issue for the
Journal of Business Venturing on qualitative research with Sue Birley (Gartner and
Birley, 2002), and the above issues seemed most salient based on this insight from that
experience: The knowledge and skills of many European entrepreneurship researchers in

<-----Page 5----->618

W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

the area of qualitative scholarship were far and ahead of their North American counterparts. My sense was (is) that North American scholars who are not steeped in the rich
European traditions and methods of qualitative scholarship simply lack clues to the kinds
of significant contributions that qualitative scholarship can make.
As Fletcher (2007) describes in her article, there was email correspondence about: the
history of the transcription of the entrepreneur's story of the founding of a toy store, which
in these articles, is labeled as the “Toy Story,” the “Toy Store” or the “Toy Store(y);” and the
reasons for why I thought this story might be of value for scholarly analysis. And,
subsequently, she wrote a manuscript about this story and sent it to me. The arrival of this
manuscript was the inflection point for knowing that there were other scholars who would
take the risk of analyzing the story of the “Toy Store,” and, that the story seemed to be
sufficient for a “Call for Papers.”
Starting with the knowledge that Denise Fletcher and I had of which scholars might have
some interest and capability to explore the Toy Store(y), I began to contact individuals to
ascertain their willingness to develop a manuscript that would be considered for
presentation at the Lloyd Greif Symposium on Emerging Organizations, which was an
event that I held at the University of Southern California. In addition, besides their
manuscript submissions to the symposium, both Chris Steyaert and Daniel Hjorth provided
numerous connections to qualitative researchers who might have important contributions to
make. From this variety of contacts, manuscripts were submitted, some were selected
(decisions were make by the special issue editor), and authors of those selected papers met
in February 2004 to present and discuss their work. This special issue then took form as
papers were reworked and revised.
A number of reasons (in the retrospection of opus operatum) can be offered for why the
“Toy Store(y)” was selected as the focus of the analyses in this special issue. First, the story
is a transcription of an entrepreneur's presentation told in a classroom setting, similar to the
format in many university entrepreneurship courses where entrepreneurs serve as “living
cases.” Second, the story is, I believe, typical of the genre of stories that entrepreneurs tell in
classroom settings, and, it would not be out of the ordinary for a successful entrepreneur to
tell a story based on a distant experience that reflected how the entrepreneur underwent a
“rite of passage” from a naïve to sophisticated entrepreneur (Smith and Anderson, 2004).
Third, the story is typical of the structure of an entrepreneur's story that would end with
explicit “lessons” of the kind “Do what I say, not what I do” yet, much of the insights that
can be gleaned from the story capture implicit and tacit knowledge about what the
entrepreneur actually does. Fourth, there are a number of situations described in the story
that are rich in their implications about the values, ethics, character, thoughts, motivations
and behaviors of the story's protagonists. Fifth, there is, as in many Harvard-type cases, a
“trick” or insight in the story where the application of a bit financial acumen would likely
lead a reader to a different conclusion as to the financial straights the entrepreneur tells us he
is in [see Baker (2007) for an exploration of this insight]. And, finally, the story, from my
perspective, was engaging, and, it seemed that part of the reason I sought to have the story
explored was to better understand why it was engaging. So, all-in-all, there seemed to be
enough material in the Toy Store(y) for other scholars to work with that could likely lead to
some keen insights about the nature of entrepreneurship. If you have not already done so, I
suggest that you read The Toy Store(y) (Allen, 2007) in this issue before reading anything

<-----Page 6----->W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

619

further in this article or any of the other articles. The Toy Store(y) article serves as the “data”
upon which all of the other articles are focused.
4. The possibilities of narrative
It would be hubris on my part to make claims that I have substantial expertise in the
scholarship of narrative and its application to entrepreneurship. I believe the articles in this
special issue are exemplars of the richness, complexity, and depth of narrative scholarship
as applied to the entrepreneurship field. I believe that my contribution to this special issue,
and to entrepreneurship scholarship, as a whole, is in my role as an amateur (as in the Latin
root “lover of”) of entrepreneurship (Gartner, 2004). I am interesting in the phenomenon of
entrepreneurship, in whatever form and manifestation (Gartner, 1985, 1993). The
implication of this, then, is that I am devoted to looking at the phenomenon of
entrepreneurship, at hand, and open to gaining whatever knowledge and skills necessary to
make sense of what is within my grasp, and the stories that entrepreneurs tell about their
ventures is more often in my day-to-day experience, than not. To explore the story that an
entrepreneur tells about the creation of a business, puts me into the scholarship of narrative,
but not as one who seeks to use an already gained expertise in narrative ideas and methods.
The review process, then, for the development of these articles, involved sending the
manuscripts out to all of the participants in the symposium, as well as to other colleagues I
thought might help provide me with insights, with the goal of encouraging these authors to
provide better clarity and understanding of narrative approaches for “non-narrative” trained
scholars. As mentioned earlier, the ability to write an article that both speaks to scholars in
narrative, as well as to outsiders to this tradition, is a challenge that these authors have met.
My intention in this section of the article is to offer my sense of some of the important
issues and ideas that are addressed in the articles in this special issue, as I have come to
appreciate them. I believe this perspective will be of value to the “typical” reader of the
Journal of Business Venturing: a reader who has knowledge of entrepreneurship
scholarship, is more likely to be using quantitative methods for exploring the phenomenon
of entrepreneurship, and, a reader who is likely to wonder about the value of narrative ideas
and methods for entrepreneurship scholarship, as a whole. It should also be recognized that
the articles speak for themselves, and that the few thoughts I offer merely hint at a
cornucopia of insights that can be gleaned from careful study.
4.1. Not the “whole story”
My analysis of the Toy Store(y) accepts this story, “as is” — this is, as a story told by
Terry Allen: nothing more and nothing less. Yet, in every analysis in this issue, scholars
challenge this “as is” assumption. Indeed, Steyaert (2007) begins his article with “I can
safely assume that this is not the whole story…” The narrative approach recognizes that a
story is never the whole story. Any story is embedded in a context which involves
recognizing: when and where the story was written (e.g., how might this story be influenced
by the time period of 1965, by the location of the story in Rutland, Vermont in 1965); who is
telling the story (e.g., what do we know and don't know about Terry Allen, the “author” of
this story, and, what about other characters in this story, such as John Simmons, the other

<-----Page 7----->620

W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

entrepreneur, or the wives, or the banker, or the toy supplier, or…), what is in this story (e.g.,
what information does the author of this story provide, what is omitted, what else could the
story say, and why wasn't it said?); and why the story is being told (e.g., what are the
author's intention's in telling this story, what were the intentions of the special issue editor
in having this story told, rather than another?).
Each of the articles in this special issue both explores and challenges the context of the
whole story of the Toy Store(y). As O'Connor (2007) posits, “We want the real goods,”
beyond the literal and superficial level of the story “as is.” Her article provides an overview
of the problems of the using the Harvard Case Method approach which assumes a reliable
representation of events and an assumption that events depicted in cases are the “facts”
rather than interpretations or assumptions. The Toy Store(y) is of a genre, a type of writing,
that has its own format and logic that is followed by both the author and the reader, and that
the genre cannot, as a format, be able to contain the “whole story.” I find that O'Connor's
analysis of Terry Allen's own lesson of the toy story “I don't know what we learned from
this thing, except that if you don't know anything it pays to be absolutely lucky” very
perceptive in how she demonstrates that Allen did learn during the events of the story about
how to make money from the genesis of the toy store idea. To talk about luck is to place this
story in the genre of other entrepreneurship stories where both Allen and the reader not only
assume luck, but, also fail to devote the effort to pursue paths to elucidate how
entrepreneurship does occur. Insights into how Terry Allen gains this knowledge does not
come easily without narrative methodologies that can parse out the interlocking logics this
escapade offers.
Fletcher (2007), through the use of the narrative approach of reader response theory,
explores the context of the Toy Store(y) itself, as products of: the author, Terry Allen; the
special issue editor, Bill Gartner; and the article author, Denise Fletcher. As readers, we expect
that there is a way in which stories will be told, and, we embrace a story about entrepreneurship
that satisfies certain assumptions and beliefs. Fletcher (2007) offers the idea of the
“stretchiness” of entrepreneurship, in that stories “stretch” beyond an author's own telling into
a larger social construction that is based both on the author's story and on what others bring to
their reading of this story, as well. The “whole story,” then, must recognize the social, political,
philosophical, and inter- and intra-personal context of the story and how it subsumes this story
into something else that is no longer just the author's story, alone.
Both Baker (2007) and Ahl (2007) suggest other stories that could be told in
conjunction with Allen's story of the Toy Store(y) as a well of capturing more of the
“whole story.” While Ahl's narrative analysis is grounded in a post-structuralist feminist
perspective, and could be viewed as, primarily, an exploration of gender issues in
entrepreneurship research and education, I see the value of her analysis in exploring this
question: “Who else should be speaking?” I find her observation that all of the men in
Allen's story have names, and the women do not, as a critical example into Ahl's feminist
perspective that men in Allen's story have, through their implicit identification, more value
and importance than the women. Yet, the women have a critical story to tell, not only as coinvestors in this venture, but also as partners and managers of the store's operations. Issues
of gender, then, are also issues about how power and influence are exercised and described,
which then implies that some individuals may be more privileged to both tell stories and to
be listened to.

<-----Page 8----->W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

621

Baker, in his application of the idea of bricolage (Baker and Nelson, 2005) to the events
of the Toy Store(y) suggests a series of other stories told by characters identified in Allen's
story as a way to show that the intentions and processes of bricolage can occur outside the
specific intentions of the entrepreneur. This idea of “network bricolage” (Baker, Miner,
Eesley, 2003), and the stories Baker offers to portray this idea, provide another example of
Allen's toy story as not being the “whole story.” While Terry Allen offers a story that makes
him the primary agent that manipulates other characters towards his goals, Ted Baker offers
stories that make these other characters the primary agents who manipulate Terry Allen
towards their goals. As examples to demonstrate the similarities and differences among
bricolage, “resource seeking,” and improvisation, Baker's use of the narrative approach
provides a way to surface how the use of bricolage may often be unrecognized, and
therefore, untold, by entrepreneurship scholars and practitioners.
4.2. “Larger voices calling”
While all of the articles in this special issue recognize a broader context of social,
political, relational, institutional, etc. characteristics that envelop Terry Allen's particular
telling of a business startup story, both Hjorth (2007) and Steyaert (2007) point to, what I
would term, “larger voices” the inform us of deeper sensibilities and strategies in the nature
of entrepreneurship. Hjorth (2007) uses the character of Iago, from Shakespeare's Othello
to speak outside of managerial and institutional perspectives embedded in our normative
views of what entrepreneurship is and how it occurs. Initially, I found the Iago/Roderigo
dialogue somewhat incongruous with Terry Allen's toy story, yet, further meditation on
Iago's words and Hjorth's exegesis of the drama of entrepreneurship, made apparent to me,
how the comprehensive demands of narrative approaches offer an understanding of human
nature, not just the nature of entrepreneurship. Rather than narrative approaches serving our
normative rationality of thinking of narrative as data for the grist of management
scholarship (e.g., Pentland, 1999), narrative approaches can fundamentally alter our world
view of what entrepreneurship is vis-à-vis the whole person. By pointing out what Iago
speaks, Hjorth yearns for what Allen leaves unspoken to the audience that expects the
“enterprise discourse.” I believe that Hjorth (2007) is right in his view that “For
entrepreneurship the art, politics, ethics, aesthetics of organization creation is, I suggest,
central.”
Steyaert (2007) very subtly probes (through the use of the philosophy of Nietzche,
literary studies, the humanities, sociology and anthropology) issues about how the
individual is construed in entrepreneurship scholarship. He suggests that “‘who is the
entrepreneur?' is not the wrong question, it is a right question wrongly formulated.” and
crafts an approach to the individual using the narrative alternative. In order to use
narrative approaches now (as in this special issue), Steyaert playfully recognizes what it
would mean to have used narrative approaches then (Gartner, 1988), when one form of the
discussion of the role of the entrepreneur in entrepreneurship was taking place.
Entrepreneurial narratives are told in the larger context of a culture of personal narratives
in which we all tell our stories in one form or another. “Larger voices” may inform us of
the many ways of (who, what, where, why and when) of story telling, yet Steyaert (2007)
asks us to consider narrative approaches as a way to “resign from analyzing and

<-----Page 9----->622

W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

interpreting stories too much and perhaps invest in completing them, playing along,
rearrange them, etc.” Narrative approaches, then, not only have value analytically, but
also, creatively.
4.3. “Attention must be paid”
As I suggested earlier, while one might consider the usefulness of narrative approaches in regards to how they might be applied to normative quantitative scholarship
in entrepreneurship, it might be more appropriate to consider how narrative approaches
are valid and insightful, in and of themselves. By implication, once one considers
narrative approaches on their own terms, the “terms” of this scholarship, are indeed
costly for the quantitative scholar to acquire. I find that the authors in this special issue
grapple with the difficulty of bringing readers into their realm of expertise and insight,
and, that competence in their areas is often broader, deeper, and more complicated than
the foundations of quantitative scholarship. I have not, for example, read recently in a
quantitatively based article how authors felt the necessity of explaining multiple linear
regression and its various nuances and applications to an analysis of their data, yet,
approaches to narrative, at least for now do seem to require more explanation. Given the
format and genre of journal articles, this lack of the easy shorthand of common
citations, methods, and terminology in narrative approaches might appear to put the
publication of articles using narrative analyses at a “competitive disadvantage” to more
easily understandable articles from a normative quantitative perspective. I am less
inclined to believe this. My view is based less on whether scholars find some relative
advantage in using particular qualitative or quantitative methodologies to enhance their
ability to publish, and more on the insight that “attention must be paid” to narrative in
entrepreneurship.
I find Bruner's (1986: 11) idea of two modes of thought (i.e., “a good story and a wellformed argument”) particularly helpful in suggesting that a focus on narrative is not about
narrative's relative value to what Bruner labels as the paradigmatic or logico-scientific
approach. The narrative approach is a comprehensive way of understanding the world. It is
ontologically complete.
“The imaginative application of the narrative mode leads instead to good stories,
gripping drama, believable (thought not necessarily “true”) historical accounts. It
deals in human or human-like intention and action and the vicissitudes and consequences that mark their course. It strives to put its timeless miracles into the
particulars of experience, and to locate the experience in time and place. Joyce
thought of the particularities of the story as epiphanies of the ordinary. The paradigmatic mode, by contrast, seeks to transcend the particular by higher and higher
reaching for abstraction, and in the end disclaims in principle any explanatory value
at all where the particular is concerned.” (Bruner, 1986: 13)
Without belaboring the differences between these two modes of thought, the point I
believe worth making here is that an understanding of the phenomenon of entrepreneurship
begs for the narrative mode. Therefore, significant growth in the application and publication
of narrative scholarship is inevitable.

5. A science of the imagination
One might be skeptical of a series of papers where, at points in their development, there is
an allowance for fiction. That is, when there are “unknowns” in the knowledge of specific
“facts as given,” the authors of these narrative analyses are likely to provide “facts as made.”
It would seem, then, that a drift towards the recognition and use of narrative approaches
places the entrepreneurship scholar in the solipsistic bind of reading “science fiction”
(creating facts to serve a fiction) or reading “fiction science” (seeing the process of creating
facts as a fiction). There might be a fear that narrative approaches might lead to taking logioscientific scholarship down the rabbit hole of treating all knowledge as “fiction.” This, I
believe, is not actually the case, and rather than setting up a struggle of either/or between
logio-scientific approaches and narrative approaches, it seems more appropriate to consider
their inherent similarities. Ormizton and Sassower (1989) point out that the word science
comes from the Latin word scientia, which means “knowledge” or scire meaning “to know.”
“Scire has its roots in skei, which means “to cut” or “to split.” Knowledge, then, is
understood as the ability, the skill “to separate one thing from another, “to discern.”
In the Greek, such separation is related to skhizein meaning “to split” into many
parts, which is the root for schizo- and schism. Thus, the ability to discern
differences, or what Plato calls in The Republic a certain kind of “mindfulness” is
related to another Latin root skel, which also means “to cut” but which is more
directly related to a concept developed later in the Old Norse where reason,
knowledge and incisiveness are comprehended by skil, a precursor to our contemporary term skill.” (p. 5).
The focus on the etymology of science, here, is to suggest to the logio-scientifically
oriented scholar that all knowledge requires the acquisition of a skill to discern it. The skills
of logio-scientific and narrative approaches are both, hard won, and both, not easily
dismissed. To acquire knowledge about the nature of entrepreneurship is to be mindful of
the phenomenon's many parts.
I do believe that a focus on entrepreneurial narratives might actually provide a unique
contribution to narrative scholarship, normative logio-scientific entrepreneurship scholarship,
and to scholarship in science, as well. I posit that normative science tends to hold up as the
culmination of the scientific method the standard of falsifiability (Popper, 1959): for an idea to
be a scientific idea, it must be testable. I will risk this speculation that the scientific process
obsesses on the selection of non-falsifiable ideas. In most cases, less concern is offered for how
ideas are generated for falsifiable testing [Campbell (1987) being a significant exception]. Yet,
in the Popperian world of falsifiability, the process of science requires the generation of ideas:
“Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means
for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her. And
we must hazard them to win our prize.” (Popper, 1959: 280).
The process of how ideas come into existence, is, an inherent aspect of entrepreneurial
narrative. To study Terry Allen's story, for example, is to struggle not only with how an idea
originates and becomes, but also with how narrative scholars struggle, themselves, with
how ideas originate and become (in their study of how their own ideas originate and

<-----Page 11----->624

W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

become when reading Terry Allen's story). The reflexiveness of narrative scholarship
speaks to a “double doubling” of idea creation as both subject and process, twice (both as
the object of study, and in the study of the study of the object).
The label, “science of the imagination” is suggested, then, as another promise (Shane and
Venkataraman, 2000) for what entrepreneurship (and specifically, entrepreneurial narrative)
might offer as a contribution to scholarship. What I find intriguing about the Terry Allen
story, is not only how the entrepreneurs constellate the toy store idea “as if” (Gartner, Bird
and Starr, 1992; Vaihinger, 1952) it were an on going business, but also how these
entrepreneurs suggest various permutations of the idea's manifestation: “What if?” There is,
in Allen's toy story, an imagination of the future in most of the actions these entrepreneurs
undertake: “What if” we start a toy store? “What if” we get toys on consignment? “What if”
we rent a space… get a loan, buy more toys, corner the market on Marvel Mustangs…? The
narrative of entrepreneurship is the generation of hypotheses about how the world might be:
how the future might look and act. The articles in this special issue not only probe how
entrepreneurs generate and modify their visions of the future, the scholars in these articles
generate and modify alternative visions of the future, as well. “What if” the reader's
knowledge and experience were taken into account in the reading of the toy story? “What if”
the women or the banker told their stories of the toy story? “What if” we were to consider all
of the paths not taken, and write these unlived lives, as lived? There is a skill here, in these six
entrepreneurial narratives, that is subtle but very critical for understanding how the
imagination works.
6. Conclusion
I had originally thought to end this introduction with the idea that entrepreneurship scholars
face a “story deficit.” That is, while we (academic entrepreneurship scholars) currently live in a
world that offers a variety of stories by and about entrepreneurs, the arena of academic
entrepreneurship scholarship seems to lack much recognition and discussion of entrepreneurship stories. Ask yourself, what stories do you call upon to talk about entrepreneurship?
While I can name dozens of entrepreneurs, I doubt whether I could actually tell much about
their stories. I have logico-scientific descriptions, explanations, categories, concepts, and
hypotheses about entrepreneurs, but, frankly, I don't have many stories to tell. Maybe you do.
While it might be appropriate to surmise that narrative approaches might challenge us to
collect more stories, I now believe that the issue is not a “story deficit” but a deficit in how
entrepreneurship stories are told. The articles that comprise this special issue show us that
there are a variety of narrative approaches that offer a multitude of insights into just one
story told by an entrepreneur. I would conjecture there might be ten times the six articles in
this special issue that could talk about Terry Allen's story. I hope that this special issue
might encourage more scholars to engage in narrative approaches and work to surmount the
difficulties of the journal publication process.
These special issue articles represent, in a more sophisticated form, Bruner's (1986: 6–7)
idea of “telling back” a story:
“One gets a sense of the psychology of genre by listening to readers “tell back” a
story they have just read or spontaneously “tell” a story about a “happening” in their

<-----Page 12----->W.B. Gartner / Journal of Business Venturing 22 (2007) 613–627

625

own lives. “Telling back” a Conrad story, one reader will turn it into a yarn of
adventure, another into a moral tale about duplicity, and a third into a case study of a
Doppelganger. The text from which they started was the same…
But stories, in Paul Ricouer's phrase, are “models for the redescription of the world.”
But the story is not by itself the model. It is, so to speak, an instantiation of models
we carry in our own minds. An undergraduate seminar in which I once participated
interpreted Hamlet as an account of the bungling of a Danish prince who had
become ‘sword happy” at his German university and who was so inept at killing the
man he hated that he did in his wisest friend, Polonius, in the process. Yet, this
student admitted, the play was a “tragedy,” but it was also a bungle (he was in
engineering — with a passion.)”
And so, in these six entrepreneurial narratives, Terry Allen is “told back:” through a
culture of personal narratives, confronted with the Harvard case method; within the
interrelationships of a set of readers and writers; as a misogynist; as a bricolager; and mute
vis-à-vis Shakespeare's Iago. Every telling is an aspect, another facet, of a more multidimensional perspective on the nature of entrepreneurship.
And, the process of “telling back” is not only of value as a scholarly exercise. Denise
Fletcher (2007) offers images of students' readings of the toy story, as a way to stretch our
imaginations of what narrative approaches might offer.
“At best, education can only be undertaken as an experiment — an attempt to
engage others by recollecting – responding or reacting – to the constellation of
textual phrasings or connections. The perpetuation of a specific tradition, or fostering disciplines, is not the issue.” (Ormizton and Sassower, 1989: 133).
I hope that this special issue engages you in new ways of knowing and talking about
entrepreneurship.
