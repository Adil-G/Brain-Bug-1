we often experience
conflict about how much of one attribute
(e.g., savings) to
trade off in favor of another (e.g., leisure). In order to explain how people resolve
such conflict,
students
of decision making have traditionally
employed
either
formal models or reason-based
analyses. The formal modeling approach, which is
commonly
used in economics,
management
science,
and decision
research,
typically
associates
a numerical
value with each alternative,
and characterizes
choice as the maximization
of value. Such value-based
accounts include normative
models, like expected utility theory (von Neumann
& Morgenstern,
1947), as well
as descriptive
models, such as prospect theory (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979). An
alternative
tradition in the study of decision making, characteristic
of scholarship
in history and the law, and typical of political and business discourse, employs an
informal,
reason-based
analysis.
This approach
identifies
various reasons and
arguments
that are purported
to enter into and influence decision, and explains
choice in terms of the balance of reasons for and against the various alternatives.
Examples of reason-based
analyses can be found in studies of historic presidential
decisions,
such as those taken during the Cuban missile crisis (e.g., Allison,
1971), the Camp David accords (Telhami,
1990), or the Vietnam
war (e.g.,
Berman,
1982; Betts & Gelb, 1979). Furthermore,
reason-based
analyses are
commonly
used to interpret “case studies” in business and law schools. Although
the reasons invoked
by researchers
may not always correspond
to those that
motivated
the actual decision makers, it is generally
agreed that an analysis in
terms of reasons may help explain decisions, especially in contexts where valuebased models can be difficult to apply.

primarily to explain non-experimental
data, particularly
unique historic, legal and
political decisions. In contrast, value-based
approaches
have played a central role
in experimental
studies of preference
and in standard economic analyses. The two
approaches,
of course, are not incompatible:
reason-based
accounts may often be
translated
into formal models, and formal analyses can generally be paraphrased
as reason-based
accounts.

we use “reasons”
in the present

by the decision maker.
Despite
its limitations,
a reason-based
conception
of choice has several
attractive features. First, a focus on reasons seems closer to the way we normally
think and talk about choices. When facing a difficult choice (e.g., between
schools, or jobs) we try to come up with reasons for and against each option - we
do not normally
attempt to estimate their overall values. Second, thinking
of
choice as guided by reasons provides a natural way to understand
the conflict that

or conflicting
reasons for competing
options.
Unlike
numerical
values, which are easy to compare, conflicting reasons may be hard to reconcile.
An analysis based on reasons can also accommodate
framing effects (Tversky &
Kahneman,
1986) and elicitation effects (Tversky, Sattath, & Slavic, 19SS), which
show that preferences
are sensitive to the ways in which options are described
(e.g., in terms of gains or losses), and to the methods through which preferences
are elicited (e.g., pricing versus choice). These findings, which are puzzling from
the perspective
of value maximization,
are easier to interpret
if we assume that

aspects of the

Finally,
a
conception
of choice based on reasons may incorporate
comparative
considerations (such as relative advantages,
or anticipated
regret) that typically remain
outside the purview of value maximization.
In this article, we explore the logic of reason-based
choice, and test some

1. Choice

between equally

attractive

options

How do decision makers resolve the conflict when faced with a choice between
two equally attractive options? To investigate this question, Slavic (1975) first had
subjects
equate pairs of alternatives,
and later asked them to make choices
between the equally valued alternatives
in each pair. One pair, for example, were
gift packages consisting of a combination
of cash and coupons. For each pair, one
component
of one alternative
was missing, as shown below, and subjects were
asked to determine
the value of the missing component
that would render the two
alternatives
equally attractive.
(In the following example, the value volunteered
by the subject may be, say, $10).
Gift package A
_

Cash
Coupon

book

worth

$32

Gift package B
$20
$18

A week later, subjects
were asked to choose between
the two equated
alternatives.
They were also asked, independently,
which dimension - cash or
coupons - they considered
more important.
Value-based
theories imply that the
two alternatives
- explicitly equated for value - are equally likely to be selected.
In contrast, in the choice between gift packages above, 88% of the subjects who
had equated these alternatives
for value then proceeded
to choose the alternative
that was higher on the dimension
that the subject considered
more important.
As Slavic (1975, 1990) suggests,
people
seem to be following
a choice
mechanism
that is easy to explain and justify: choosing according to the more
important
dimension
provides
a better reason for choice than, say, random
selection, or selection of the right-hand option. Slavic (1975) replicated the above
pattern in numerous
domains, including choices between college applicants,
auto
tires, baseball players, and routes to work. (For additional
data and a discussion
of elicitation
procedures,
see Tversky et al., 1988.) All the results were consistent
with the hypothesis that people do not choose between the equated alternatives

analysis of choice, the two tasks are
choice situation it should not matter whether people

are asked which option they prefer, or which they would reject. Because it is the
options themselves
that are assumed to matter, not the way in which they are
described,
if people prefer the first they will reject the second, and vice versa.
As suggested by Franklin’s
opening quote, our decision will depend partially
on the weights we assign to the options’ pros and cons. We propose that the
positive features of options (their pros) will loom larger when choosing, whereas
the negative features of options (their cons) will be weighted more heavily when
rejecting.
It is natural to select an option because of its positive features, and to
reject an option because of its negative features. To the extent that people base
their decisions on reasons for and against the options under consideration,
they
are likely to focus on reasons for choosing an option when deciding which to
choose, and to focus on reasons for rejecting an option when deciding which to
reject.
This hypothesis
leads to a straightforward
prediction:
consider
two
options, an enriched option, with more positive and more negative features, and
an impoverished option,
with fewer positive
and fewer negative
features.
If
positive features are weighted more heavily when choosing than when rejecting
and negative
features
are weighted relatively
more when rejecting
than when
choosing,
then an enriched
option could be both chosen and rejected
when
compared
to an impoverished
option. Let PC and P, denote,
respectively,
the
percentage
of subjects who choose and who reject a particular option. If choosing
and rejecting are complementary,
then the sum PC + P, should equal 100. On the
other hand, according to the above hypothesis,
PC + P, should be greater than 100
for the enriched
option and less than 100 for the impoverished
option.
This
pattern
was observed
by Shafir (1993). Consider,
for example,
the following
problem which was presented
to subjects in two versions that differed only in the
bracketed
questions.
One half of the subjects received one version, the other half
received
the other.
The enriched
option
appears
last, although
the order
presented
to subjects was counterbalanced.

Parent A, the impoverished
option, is quite plain -with no striking positive or
negative features. There are no particularly
compelling
reasons to award or deny
this parent custody of the child. Parent B, the enriched option, on the other hand,
has good reasons to be awarded custody (a very close relationship
with the child
and a good income),
but also good reasons to be denied sole custody (health
problems
and extensive absences due to travel). To the right of the options are
the percentages
of subjects who chose to award and to deny custody to each of
the parents. Parent B is the majority choice both for being awarded custody of the
child and for being denied it. As predicted, P, + P, for parent B (64 + 55 = 119) is

greater than 100, the value expected if choosing and rejecting were

(z = 2.48, p < .02). This pattern is explained by the observation
that the enriched
parent (parent
B) provides more compelling
reasons to be
awarded as well as denied child custody.
The above pattern
has been replicated
in hypothetical
choices between
monetary
gambles, college courses, and political candidates
(Shafir, 1993). For
another example, consider the following problem,
presented
to half the subjects

We suggest that the gorgeous beaches are likely to provide a more
compelling
reason when we choose than when we reject, and the lack of nightlife
is likely to play a more central role when we reject than when we choose. Indeed,
spot B’s share of being preferred
and rejected exceeds that of spot A (P, + P, =
67 + 48 = 115, p < .05). These results demonstrate
that options are not simply
ordered
according
to value, with the more attractive

and the less

Instead,
it appears that the relative importance

3. Choice under conflict: seeking options
The need to choose often creates conflict: we are not sure how to trade off one
attribute
relative to another or, for that matter, which attributes
matter to us
most. It is a commonplace
that we often attempt to resolve such conflict by
seeking reasons for choosing one option over another.
At times, the conflict
between
available
alternatives
is hard to resolve, which may lead us to seek
additional
options, or to maintain the status quo. Other times, the context is such
that a comparison
between alternatives
generates
compelling
reasons to choose
one option over another. Using reasons to resolve conflict has some non-obvious
implications,
which are addressed below. The present section focuses on people’s
decision
to seek other alternatives;
the next section explores some effects of
adding options to the set under consideration.
In many contexts, we need to decide whether to opt for an available option or
search for additional
alternatives.
Thus, a person who wishes to buy a used car
may settle for a car that is currently available or continue searching for additional
models. Seeking new alternatives
usually requires additional
time and effort, and
may involve the risk of losing the previously
available options. Conflict plays no
role in the classical theory of choice. In this theory, each option x has a value u(x)
such that, for any offered set, the decision maker selects the option with the
highest
value.
In particular,
a person
is expected
to search for additional
alternatives
only if the expected value of searching exceeds that of the best option
currently
available.
A reliance on reasons, on the other hand, entails that we
should be more likely to opt for an available option when we have a convincing
reason for its selection,
and that we should be more likely to search further when
a compelling
reason for choice is not readily available.
To investigate
this hypothesis,
Tversky and Shafir (1992b) presented
subjects
with pairs of options, such as bets varying in probability
and payoff, or student
apartments
varying in monthly rent and distance from campus, and had subjects
choose one of the two options or, instead, request an additional
option, at some

<-----Page 8----->Shafir et al. I Cognition

Note that in both pairs of problems the choice between x and y - the conflict
condition - is non-trivial
because the xs are better on one dimension
and the ys
are better on the other. In contrast, the choice between x and X’ - the dominance
condition - involves no conflict because the former strictly dominates
the latter.
Thus, while there is no obvious reason to choose one option over the other in the
conflict condition,
there is a decisive argument
for preferring
one of the two
alternatives
in the dominance
condition.
On average, subjects requested an additional alternative
64% of the time in the
conflict condition,
and only 40% of the time in the dominance
condition
(p <
.05). Subjects’ tendency
to search for additional
options,
in other words, was
greater when the choice among alternatives
was harder to rationalize,
than when
there was a compelling
reason and the decision was easy.
These data are inconsistent
with the principle of value maximization.
According to value maximization,
a subject should search for additional
alternatives

dominance
condition is also available in the conflict condition,
value maximization
implies that the percentage
of subjects who seek an additional
alternative
cannot
be greater
in the conflict than in the dominance
condition,
contrary
to the
observed data.
It appears that the search for additional
alternatives
depends not only on the
value of the best available option, as implied by value maximization,
but also on
the difficulty of choosing among the options under consideration.
In situations of
dominance,
for example,
there are clear and indisputable
reasons for choosing
is equally distant and I save
one option over another
(e.g., “This apartment
$40!“). Having a compelling
argument
for choosing one of the options over the
rest reduces the temptation
to look for additional
alternatives.
When the choice
involves conflict, on the other hand, reasons for choosing any one of the options
are less immediately
available and the decision is more difficult to justify (e.g.,
“Should I save $60 a month, or reside 18 minutes closer to campus?“).
In the
absence of compelling
reasons for choice, there is a greater tendency to search for
other alternatives.

people’s preferences
among options
that were available
all along. Whereas
in the previous
section we considered
people’s tendency
to seek alternatives
in the context of a given set of options, in
this section we illustrate phenomena
that arise through the addition of options,
and interpret
them in terms of reasons for choice.
A major testable
implication
of value maximization
is that a non-preferred
option cannot become preferred when new options are added to the offered set.
In particular,
a decision maker who prefers y over the option to defer the choice
should not prefer to defer the choice when both y and x are available.
That the
“market
share” of an option cannot be increased by enlarging the offered set is
known as the regularity condition (see Tvcrsky & Simonson,
in press). Contrary to
regularity,
numerous
experimental
results indicate
that the tendency
to defer
choice can increase with the addition of alternatives.
Consider,
for instance,
the
degree of conflict that arises when a person is presented with one attractive option
(which he or she prefers to deferring
the choice), compared
to two competing
alternatives.
Choosing one out of two competing
alternatives
can be difficult: the
mere fact that an alternative
is attractive
may not in itself provide a compelling
reason for its selection,
because the other option may be equally attractive.
The
addition
of an alternative
may thus make the decision harder to justify, and
increase the tendency
to defer the decision.
A related phenomenon
was aptly described by Thomas Schelling, who tells of
an occasion in which he had decided to buy an encyclopedia
for his children. At
the bookstore,
he was presented
with two attractive encyclopedias
and, finding it
difficult to choose between the two, ended up buying neither - this, despite the
fact that had only one encyclopedia
been available he would have happily bought

there are situations
in which people prefer each of the
available alternatives
over the status quo but do not have a compelling reason for
choosing
among the alternatives
and, as a result, defer the decision,
perhaps
indefinitely.
The phenomenon
described
by Schelling was demonstrated
Shafir (1992b) in the following pair of problems,
which were
groups of students (n = 124 and 121, respectively).

The results indicate that people are more likely to buy a CD player in the
latter, low-conflict, condition than in the former, high-conflict, situation (p < .05).
Both models - the AIWA and the SONY - seem attractive,
both are well priced,
and both are on sale. The decision maker needs to determine
whether she is
better
off with a cheaper,
popular
model,
or with a more expensive
and
sophisticated
one. This conflict is apparently
not easy to resolve, and compels
many subjects to put off the purchase until they learn more about the various
options.
On the other hand, when the SONY alone is available,
there are
compelling
arguments for its purchase: it is a popular player, it is very well priced,
and it is on sale for 1 day only. In this situation,
having good reasons to choose
the offered option, a greater majority of subjects decide to opt for the CD player
rather than delay the purchase.
The addition of a competing alternative
in the preceding example increased the
tendency to delay decision. Clearly, the level of conflict and its ease of resolution
depend not only on the number
of options available,
but on how the options
compare.
Consider,
for example,
the following problem,
in which the original
AIWA player was replaced by an inferior model (n = 62).

In this version, contrary to the previous high-conflict version, the AIWA player
is dominated
by the SONY: it is inferior in quality and costs more. Thus, the
presence of the AIWA does not detract from the reasons for buying the SONY, it
actually supplements
them: the SONY is well priced, it is on sale for 1 day only,
and it is clearly better than its competitor.
As a result, the SONY is chosen more
often than before the inferior AIWA was added. The ability of an asymmetrically
dominated
or relatively inferior alternative,
when added to a set, to increase the
attractiveness
and choice probability
of the dominating
option is known as the
asymmetric
dominance
effect (Huber,
Payne, & Puto, 1982). Note that in both
the high-conflict and the dominance problems subjects were presented
with two
CD players and an option to delay choice. Subjects’ tendency to delay, however,
is much greater when they lack clear reasons for buying either player, than when
they have compelling
reasons to buy one player and not the other (p < .005).
The above patterns violate the regularity condition,
which is assumed to hold
so long as the added alternatives
do not provide new and relevant information.
In
the above scenario, one could argue that the added options (the superior player in
one case and the inferior player in the other) conveyed
information
about the
consumer’s
chances of finding a better deal. Recall that information
considerations could not explain the search experiments
of the previous section because
there subjects reviewed all the potentially
available options. Nevertheless,
to test
this interpretation
further, Tversky and Shafir (1992b) devised a similar problem,
involving
real payoffs, in which the option to defer is not available.
Students
(n = 80) agreed
to fill out a brief questionnaire
for $1.50. Following
the
questionnaire,
one half of the subjects were offered the opportunity
to exchange
the $1.50 (the default) for one of two prizes: a metal Zebra pen (henceforth,
Zebra), or a pair of plastic Pilot pens (henceforth,
Pilot). The other half of the
subjects were only offered the opportunity
to exchange the $1.50 for the Zebra.
The prizes were shown to the subjects, who were also informed that each prize
regularly
costs a little over $2.00. Upon indicating
their preference,
subjects
received their chosen option. The results were as follows. Seventy-five

Thus, in
accord with the asymmetric
dominance
effect, the tendency to prefer x over y can
be increased by adding a third alternative
z that is clearly inferior to x but not to y
(see Fig. 1). The phenomenon
of asymmetric
dominance
was first demonstrated,
by Huber,
Payne, and Puto (1982), in choices between
hypothetical
options.
Wedell (1991) reports similar findings using monetary
gambles.
The following
example involving real choices is taken from Simonson and Tversky (1992). One
group (n = 106) was offered a choice between $6 and an elegant Cross pen. The
pen was selected by 36% of the subjects, and the remaining
64% chose the cash.
A second group (n = 115) was given a choice among three options: $6 in cash, the
same Cross pen, and a second pen that was distinctly less attractive.

the subjects

pen, but its presence

effects, called extremeness
aversion,
which refers to the finding that,
within an offered set, options with extreme values are relatively
less attractive
than options with intermediate
values (Simonson,
1989). For example, consider
two-dimensional
options x, y, and z, such that y lies between x and z (see Fig. 2).
Considerations
of value maximization
imply that the middle alternative,
y, should
be relatively
less popular in the trinary choice than in either one of the binary
comparisons
(y compared
to x, or y compared to z). Extremeness
aversion,
on
the other hand, yields the opposite prediction because y has small advantages
and
disadvantages
with respect to x and to z, whereas both x and z have more
extreme advantages
and disadvantages
with respect to each other. This pattern
was observed
in several experiments.
For example,
subjects were shown five
35 mm cameras varying in quality and price. One group (n = 106) was then given
a choice between two cameras:
a Minolta X-370 priced at $170 and a Minolta
3000i priced at $240. A second group (n = 115) was given an additional
option,
the Minolta 7000i priced at $470. Subjects in the first group were split evenly
between the two options, yet 57% of the subjects in the second group chose the
middle option (Minolta 3OOOi), with the remaining divided about equally between
the two extreme options. Thus, the introduction
of an extreme option reduced the
“market share” of the other extreme option, but not of the middle option. Note

The indeterminacy
of reasons for going to Hawaii discourages
many students
from buying the vacation,
even when both outcomes - passing or failing the
exam - ultimately
favor this course of action. Tversky and Shafir (1992a) call the
above pattern
of decisions
a disjunction effect. Evidently,
a disjunction
of
different
reasons (reward in case of success or consolation
in case of failure) is
often less compelling
than either definite reason alone. A significant proportion
of
the students
above were willing to pay, in effect, for information
that was
ultimately
not going to affect their decision - they would choose to go to Hawaii
in either case - but that promised to leave them with a more definite reason for
making that choice. The willingness to pay for non-instrumental
information
is at
variance with the classical model, in which the worth of information
is determined
only by its potential
to influence decision.
People’s preference
for definite as opposed to disjunctive
reasons has significant implications
in cases where the option to defer decision is not available.
Consider
the following
series of problems
presented
by Tversky
and Shafir
(1992a) to 98 students.
Win llose version:
Imagine
that you have just played a game of chance that gave you a 50%
chance to win $200 and a 50% chance to lose $100. The coin was tossed and
you have [won $200/last $1001. You are now offered a second identical gamble:

group of subjects (n = 123) were presented with both the fail and the pass versions,
and asked whether or not they would buy the vacation package in each case. Two thirds of the
subjects
made the same choice in the two conditions,
indicating
that the data for the disjunctive
version cannot be explained by the hypothesis
that those who like the vacation in case they pass the
exam do not like it in case they fail, and vice versa. Note that while only one third of the subjects
made different decisions depending
on the outcome of the exam, more than 60% of the subjects chose
to wait when the outcome was not known.

already been tossed, but that you will not know whether you have won $200 or
lost $100 until you make your decision concerning
a second, identical gamble:
50% chance to win $200 and 50% chance to lose $100. Would YOU?:
(a) accept the second gamble.
(b) reject the second gamble.

36%
64%

The data show that a majority of subjects accepted the second gamble after
having won the first gamble and a majority also accepted the second gamble after
having lost the first gamble.
However,
the majority
of subjects
rejected
the
second gamble when the outcome of the first was not known. An examination
of
individual
choices reveals that approximately
40% of the subjects accepted the
second gamble both after a gain in the first and after a loss. Among these,
however, 65% rejected the second gamble in the disjunctive
condition,
when the
outcome
of the first gamble was not known.
Indeed,
this response
pattern
(accepting in both conditions
but rejecting in the disjunction)
was the single most
frequent
pattern,
exhibited by 27% of all subjects. This pattern,
which violates
Savage’s
(1954)
sure-thing
principle,
cannot
be attributed
to unreliability
(Tversky & Shafir, 1992a).
The students above were offered a gamble with a positive expected value, and
an even chance of a non-trivial
loss. Different
reasons were likely to arise for
accepting
the second gamble depending
on the outcome of the first. In the win
condition,
the decision maker is already up $200, so even a loss on the second
gamble leaves him or her ahead overall, which makes this option quite attractive.
In the lose condition,
on the other hand, the decision maker is down $100.
Playing the second gamble offers a chance to “get out of the red”, which for many
is more attractive
than accepting a sure $100 loss. In the disjunctive condition,
however, the decision maker does not know whether she is up $200 or down $100;

<-----Page 19----->30

already been tossed, but that you will not know whether you have won $600 or
$300 until you make your decision concerning
a second gamble: 50% chance to
win $200 and 50% chance to lose $100.
A total of 171 subjects were presented with this problem, equally divided into
three groups. One group was told that they had won $300 on the first gamble, a
second group was told that they had won $600 on the first gamble, and the third
group was told that the outcome
of the first gamble - $300 or $600 -was
not
known (the disjunctive
version). In all cases, subjects had to decide whether to
accept or to reject the second gamble which, as in the previous problem, consisted
of an even chance to win $200 or lose $100. The percentage
of subjects who
accepted
the second gamble in the $300, $600, and disjunctive
versions,
were
69%, 75%, and 73%, respectively.
(Recall that the corresponding
figures for the
original
problem
were 59%, 69%, and 36%; essentially
identical
figures were
obtained
in a between-subjects
replication
of that problem.)
In contrast to the
original problem, the second gamble in this modified problem was equally popular
in the disjunctive
as in the non-disjunctive
versions. Whereas
in the original
scenario the second gamble amounted
to either a no-loss proposition
or a chance
to avoid a sure loss, in the modified scenario the second gamble amounts to a
no-loss proposition
regardless of the outcome of the first gamble. The increased
popularity
of the second gamble in the modified problem shows that it is not the
disjunctive
situation itself that discourages
people from playing. Rather, it is the
lack of a specific reason that seems to drive the effect: when the same reason
applies regardless of outcome, the disjunction
no longer reduces the tendency to
accept the gamble.
As illustrated
above, changes in the context of decision are likely to alter the
reasons that subjects bring to mind and, consequently,
their choices. Elsewhere
(Shafir & Tversky,
1992) we describe a disjunction
effect in the context of a
one-shot
prisoner’s
dilemma
game, played on a computer
for real payoffs.
Subjects (n = 80) played a series of prisoner’s dilemma games, without feedback,
each against a different unknown
player. In this setup, the rate of cooperation
was 3% when subjects knew that the other player had defected, and 16% when
they knew that the other had cooperated.

The above “disjunctive”
manipulation
- which has no direct bearing from the
point of view of value maximization
- appears
to influence
the reasons
for
decision that people bring to mind. Another kind of manipulation
that seems to
alter people’s reasons without bearing directly on options’ values is described in
what follows.

6. Non-valued

The positive features of an option typically provide reasons
for choosing that option and its negative features typically provide reasons for

What happens when we add features that are neither attractive
nor
aversive?
Can choice be influenced
by features that have little or no value?
Simonson and his colleagues have conducted a number of studies on the effects
of non-valued
features,
and tested the hypothesis
that people are reluctant
to
choose alternatives
that are supported by reasons that they do not find appealing.
In one study, for example, Simonson,
Nowlis, and Simonson (in press) predicted
that people would be less likely to choose an alternative
that was chosen by
another person for a reason that does not apply to them. UC Berkeley business
students
(n = 113) were told that, because of budget cuts and in order to save
paper and duplicating
costs, a questionnaire
that they will receive was designed
for use by two respondents.
Thus, when subjects had to enter a choice, they could
see the choice made by the previous “respondent”
and the reason given for it.
The choices and reasons of the previous respondents
were systematically
manipulated. One problem,
for example, offered a choice between attending
the MBA
programs
at Northwestern
and UCLA. In one version of the questionnaire,
the
previous respondent
had selected Northwestern,
and provided the (handwritten)
reason, “I have many relatives in the Chicago area.” Because this reason does not
apply to most subjects,
it was expected to reduce their likelihood
of choosing
Northwestern.
In a second version,
no reason was given for the choice of
Northwestern.
As expected, those exposed to an irrelevant reason were less likely

For example, an offer to purchase a collector’s plate - that most did not want - if
one buys a particular brand of cake mix was shown to lower the tendency to buy
that particular
brand relative to a second, comparable
cake mix brand (from 31%
to 14%, p < .OS).Choosing brands that offer worthless bonuses was judged (in a
related study) as more difficult to justify and as more susceptible to criticism. An
analysis of verbal protocols showed that a majority of those who failed to select
the endowed option explicitly mentioned
not needing the added feature. It should
be noted that sale promotions,
such as the one involving the collector’s plate offer
above, are currently
employed
by a wide range of companies
and there is no
evidence
that they lead to any inferences
about the quality of the promoted
product (e.g., Blattberg
& Neslin, 1990).
The above manipulations
all added “positive”,
albeit weak or irrelevant,
features,
which should not diminish
an option’s
value; yet, they apparently
provide a reason against choosing the option, especially when other options are
otherwise
equally attractive.
Evidently,
the addition of a potentially
attractive
feature that proves useless can provide a reason to reject the option in favor of a
competing
alternative
that has no “wasted” features.

7. Concluding

remarks

People’s choices may occasionally
stem from affective judgments
that preclude
a thorough evaluation
of the options (cf. Zajonc, 1980). In such cases, an analysis
of the reasons for choice may prove unwarranted
and, when attempted
by the
decision maker, may actually result in a different,
and possibly inferior, decision
(Wilson
& Schooler,
1991). Other choices, furthermore,
may follow standard
operating
procedures
that involve minimal
reflective
effort. Many decisions,
nonetheless,
result from a careful evaluation
of options, in which people attempt
to arrive at what they believe is the best choice. Having discarded
the less
attractive
options and faced with a choice that is hard to resolve, people often
search for a compelling
rationale
for choosing one alternative
over another.

principles
that govern the role of reasons in decision making, and thus some of
the fundamental
our understanding

ways in which thinking about reasons is likely to contribute
to
of the making of decisions. A reliance on the more important

dimensions-those
likely to provide more compelling
reasons for choice -was
shown in section 1 to predict preferences
between previously
equated options.
The notions of compatibility
and salience were summoned
in section 2 to account
for the differential
weighting
of reasons
in a choice versus rejection
task.
Reasons,
it appears, lend themselves
to certain framing manipulations
that are
harder
to explain from the perspective
of value maximization.
In section 3,
manipulating
the precise relationships
between competing
alternatives
was shown
to enhance or reduce conflict, yielding decisions that were easier or more difficult
to rationalize
and justify. Providing a context that presents compelling
reasons for
choosing an option apparently
increases people’s tendency to opt for that option,
whereas
comparing
alternatives
that render
the aforementioned
reasons
less

tends to increase people’s tendency
to maintain
the status quo or
search for other alternatives.
The ability of the context of decision to generate
reasons that affect choice was further discussed in section 4, where the addition
and removal of competing
alternatives
was interpreted
as generating
arguments
for choice based on comparative
considerations
of relative
advantages
and
compromise.
The relative weakness of disjunctive
reasons was discussed in section
5. There, a number of studies contrasted
people’s willingness to reach a decision
based on a definite reason for choice, with their reluctance
to arrive at a decision
in the presence of uncertainty
about which reason is actually relevant to the case
at hand. Section 6 briefly reviewed choice situations
in which the addition
of
purported
reasons for choosing an option, which subjects did not find compelling,
was seen to diminish their tendency to opt for that option, even though its value
had not diminished.
The nature of the reasons that guide decision,
and the ways in which they
interact,
await further investigation,
There is evidence
to suggest that a wide
variety of arguments
play a role in decision making. We often search for a
convincing
rationale
for the decisions that we make, whether for inter-personal
purposes,
so that we can explain to others the reasons for our decision, or for
intra-personal
motives, so that we may feel confident of having made the “right”
choice. Attitudes
toward risk and loss can sometimes be rationalized
on the basis
of common
myths or cliches, and choices are sometimes
made on the basis of

Indeed, it has been repeatedly
observed

that the axioms of rational choice which are often violated in non-transparent
situations
are generally
satisfied when their application
is transparent
(e.g.,
Tversky & Kahneman,
1986). These results suggest that the axioms of rational
choice act as compelling
arguments,
or reasons, for making a particular
decision
when their applicability
has been detected,
not as universal
laws that constrain
people’s choices.
In contrast to the classical theory that assumes stable values and preferences,
it
appears that people often do not have well-established
values, and that preferences are actually constructed
- not merely revealed - during their elicitation
(cf. Payne, Bettman,
& Johnson,
1992). A reason-based
approach lends itself well
to such a constructive
interpretation.
Decisions,
according to this analysis, are
often reached by focusing on reasons that justify the selection of one option over
another.
Different frames, contexts, and elicitation procedures

decision.
The reliance on reasons to explain experimental
findings has been the hallmark
of social psychological
analyses.
Accounts
of dissonance
(Wicklund
& Brehm,
1976) and self-perception
(Bern, 1972), for example, focus on the reasons that
people
muster
in an attempt
to explain
their counter-attitudinal
behaviors.
Similarly,
attribution
theory (Heider,
1980) centers around
the reasons
that
people attribute
to others’ behavior.
These studies, however,
have primarily
focused
on postdecisional
rationalization
rather
than predecisional
conflict.
Although
the two processes
are closely related,
there are nevertheless
some
important
differences.
Much of the work in social psychology
has investigated
how people’s decisions affect the way they think. The present paper, in contrast,
has considered
how the reasons that enter into people’s thinking about a problem
influence their decision. A number of researchers
have recently begun to explore
related issues. Billig (1987), for example, has adopted a rhetorical
approach to
understanding
social psychological
issues, according to which “our inner deliberations are silent arguments
conducted
within a single self” (p. 5). Related
“explanation-based”
models of decision making have been applied by Pennington
and Hastie (1988, 1992) to account for judicial decisions, and the importance

Rather,
we suggest that an analysis of reasons may illuminate
some aspects of
reflective choice, and generate new hypotheses for further study.
