As American colleges and universities have increasingly become involved in economic
development since the mid-1980s, there has been a concomitant growth of interest in
measuring the impacts of higher education on regional economies. This study examines the influences of 4-year colleges and universities in the United States at the metropolitan level, focusing on the internal and external factors that affect the generation of
regional economic development impacts, the spatial extent of the impacts, and separating the effects of different university functions. Knowledge-based university activities,
particularly teaching and basic research, are found to have substantial positive effects
on regional earnings gains. The greatest impacts occur in small- and medium-sized
regions, suggesting that universities may be able to act as a substitute for agglomeration economies. Spatial spillovers across regions are influential as well, indicating a relatively flat spatial gradient of university impacts that stretches to neighboring
regions.
Keywords: economic development; universities; higher education; knowledge production; externalities

The past two decades have witnessed escalating interest in understanding the impacts of institutions of higher education on the processes of regional economic growth and development. Dramatic changes in global and regional economic conditions, including the increasing globalization
of commerce and continuing long-term declines in traditional manufacturing sectors, have
induced state and regional economic development agencies in the United States as well as other
economically advanced nations to invest in strategies to leverage the emerging knowledge-based
economy in their regions. These strategies have included efforts to attract and retain technologyintensive industries and innovative firms, to imbue the labor force with the skills needed for productivity in the knowledge economy, and to enhance regional abilities to adjust in the face of
rapidly changing economic circumstances.
Many approaches have focused on public universities as the primary public producers of
knowledge, such as strengthening technology transfer programs, encouraging university-industry
partnerships, and tailoring educational curricula to match the skill demands of knowledge-based
industries. In the United States, congressional passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980 and subsequent related legislation granted universities the intellectual property rights to patentable inventions arising from federally sponsored research, thus supporting engagement in entrepreneurial
and technology development activities (see Mowery, Nelson, Sampat, & Ziedonis, 1999). Encouraged at both the state and federal levels, as well as by the lure of additional funding in a period of

tight budgets, U.S. universities have generally embraced the goal of economic development as a
complement to their traditional missions of education, research, and public service.
Public investments of any kind generate a range of questions concerning the magnitude and distribution of their impacts as well as their effectiveness in achieving desired objectives. In the case
of public research universities, issues of knowledge and spatial spillovers are central to determining expected regional economic impacts. The continuing development and appeal of economic
frameworks such as new growth theory and new economic geography have focused additional
attention, both within and outside of academe, on the processes of innovation and knowledge production and diffusion. Nevertheless, attempts to understand and assess the activities of institutions
of higher education have varied widely, both in terms of the methodologies used and the range of
estimates produced regarding the impacts of universities on their regional economies.
This article addresses the question of whether and to what extent institutions of higher education, specifically 4-year universities in the United States, influence regional economic development outcomes. In so doing, we concentrate on three primary research questions. First, we distinguish among several key university activities, including teaching, basic research, and
technology development, in order to separate their impacts on regional development while also differentiating effects due to additional regional and external factors. Second, we assess the regional
importance and geographic extent of spatial spillovers arising from university activities. Third, we
explore the role of universities in relation to regional agglomeration economies in achieving positive economic development outcomes. The article extends previous research by using a comprehensive data set encompassing all metropolitan regions and universities in the United States,
explicitly addressing spatial spillovers, and separating impacts attributable to different university
functions.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
One task that is fundamental to the issue of assessing the economic impacts of higher education
is to distinguish the different ways in which colleges and universities potentially contribute to
regional economic development. Modern universities embody a diverse set of missions and organizational goals that differently affect their surrounding regions, ranging from the traditional functions of teaching and public service to the more recent activities of licensing inventions and engaging collaboratively in research with private sector industries (Glasson, 2003; Thanki, 1999).
Synthesizing previous research, Goldstein, Maier, and Luger (1995) identify eight different functions or outputs of modern research universities that lead to economic development impacts: (a)
creation of knowledge, (b) human capital creation, (c) transfer of existing know-how, (d) technological innovation, (e) capital investment, (f) regional leadership, (g) influence on regional milieu,
and (h) knowledge infrastructure production.
Although the first six of these outputs are relatively straightforward, the last two are less
well defined, and thus worth specifying in more detail. Influence on regional milieu denotes
the distinctive contributions to atmosphere and environment—intellectual, cultural, social, and
recreational—that universities impart to their surrounding regions, typically unintentionally, as a
by-product of their presence and activities. Such externalities are often highly valued by residents
as well as businesses and other regional organizations. There can be negative externalities as well,
such as rises in labor and commercial costs accompanying university employment growth.
The notion of knowledge infrastructure originated in the economics literature with endogenous
growth theory as one component of the more extensive regional agglomeration economies concept
(Krugman, 1991; Romer, 1990). Knowledge infrastructure can be defined as the stock of knowledge together with the institutional and organizational components that support its growth and
application (Smith, 1997). On the regional scale, knowledge infrastructure includes not only the
system of public and private knowledge-producing institutions but also the innovation and learning capacities of firms, workers, and institutions and the network of connections among them.
Thus, many elements of knowledge infrastructure exist even in regions lacking major research universities. The interactions among the components of knowledge infrastructure form the basis for

the third research question posed in this article of whether universities rely on or can substitute for
other forms of knowledge infrastructure in a region. In quantitative studies, knowledge infrastructure is often generalized to agglomeration economies or proxied by agglomeration measures.
Because of narrow topic areas and data constraints, nearly all studies of university impacts have
considered only one or two of the outputs identified by Goldstein et al. (1995). Traditional methods
of assessing the impacts of universities have focused largely on those impacts arising from direct
spending and regional investment activities, whereas more recent approaches have concentrated
on basic knowledge and human capital creation, knowledge infrastructure provision, technological innovation, and technology transfer activities of universities. Little research has considered
separately the impacts of regional leadership or university influence on the regional milieu. The
primary methodological approaches to investigating the impacts of universities on regional economic development that are observed in the literature are case studies, surveys, econometric analyses, and cross-sectional and quasi-experimental designs (Salter & Martin, 2001).
Case studies of university economic impacts in the United States can be traced back in the literature at least as far as an influential 1971 American Council on Education report that set forth a standardized approach to impact estimation (Blackwell, Cobb, & Weinberg, 2002; Felsenstein, 1996;
Goldstein, 1989). Most case studies estimate the direct and indirect impacts of university spending,
investment, and employment in a region through growth accounting, regional input-output modeling, estimation of Keynesian multipliers, or occasionally a broader economic forecasting model
(Candell & Jaffe, 1999; Thanki, 1999). For example, Harris’s (1997) analysis of the University of
Portsmouth finds an employment multiplier between 1.55 and 1.79 and an output multiplier of
1.24 to 1.73, and Glasson (2003) calculates an output multiplier of 0.70 to 1.12 for Sunderland
University. Felsenstein (1996) uses an econometric model based on input-output relationships to
estimate that Northwestern University contributed more than 10,000 jobs (an employment multiplier of 1.55) and half a billion dollars in output to the Chicago region in 1993. He goes further,
simulating the adjustments in regional population and employment that would occur over time in
the counterfactual situation (i.e., removing the university from the model). Candell and Jaffe
(1999) adopt several variants of input-output methodology to analyze the extent to which research
institutions affect local industries in Massachusetts, concluding that the creation of start-up firms is
one of the most localized impacts of publicly funded research. Numerous researchers have investigated student migration patterns but have failed to produce consistent conclusions (e.g., Blackwell
et al., 2002; Felsenstein, 1995, 1996, 1999; Goldstein & Luger 1992; Huffman & Quigley, 2002).
It is especially difficult to estimate the induced effects of human capital in attracting private sector
activity (Malecki, 1997). Felsenstein (1994) reviews many earlier U.S. university economic impact studies.
The case study framework is severely constrained by information availability in deriving quantitative estimates for the range of economic impacts. Multiplier and input-output techniques are
limited to assessing the backward linkages induced by the spending and regional investment activities of universities, whereas expenditure analyses fail to consider the so-called dynamic impacts of
knowledge production or other university outputs that alter interfirm relationships (Martin, 1998;
Thanki, 1999). Impact studies also require explicit counterfactual assumptions to compare impacts
with what would have occurred in the absence of the university, and these vary widely across
studies.
One approach is to measure outputs of interest rather than ultimate economic outcomes, including spin-off firms, university-industry linkages, and patents and license income (e.g., Clinch,
1996; Feller, Ailes, & Roessner, 2002; Jones-Evans, Klofsten, Andersson, & Pandya, 1999;
Steffensen, Rogers, & Speakman, 2000; Walshok, Furtek, Lee, & Windham, 2002). Pressman,
Guterman, Abrams, Geist, and Nelsen (1995) examine the 205 active patent license agreements
held by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995 and estimate induced industrial investments of $980,000 per license-year. Kramer, Scheibe, Reavis, and Berneman (1997) calculate a
similar figure of $930,000 for the University of Pennsylvania. Rogers et al. (1999) count 19 spinoff firms from University of New Mexico research centers through 1996. Unfortunately, by carrying the analyses only to the stage of program outputs, these studies do little to further our understanding of the ultimate impacts of university activities on economic development outcomes.

<-----Page 4----->Goldstein, Drucker / ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

Another strategy is to focus on qualitative or anecdotal information, such as the extent and quality of university-industry linkages (Candell & Jaffe, 1999; Feldman, 1994; Glasson, 2003). Weiler
(2000) presents a case study of the impacts of Colorado State University’s agricultural extension in
helping link microbreweries to local growers. Keane and Allison (1999) use a structured interview
framework to analyze the University of the Sunshine Coast and argue that the effects of university
generation and support of local knowledge infrastructure outweigh traditional expenditure and
employment impacts. Qualitative approaches circumvent some of the information deficits of quantitative case studies but do so at the expense of general comparability with other studies.
The principal advantage of the case study approach consists in being able to collect primary data
on a wide variety of subjects (including some not amenable to quantification). There are two main
drawbacks: the difficulty of attribution—determining the causal link between university activities
and regional outcomes of interest—and the lack of generalizability to other universities, other
regions, or even different economic situations. These two shortcomings have meant that little in the
case study literature begins to answer the research questions posed in this article. In theory, multiple case studies using standard data and techniques could be combined to yield conclusions with
greater external validity, but the relatively high cost of primary data collection makes this infeasible in practice.
A second methodology evident in the literature is based on surveys. Although case studies often
incorporate information gathered via questionnaires, the survey approach is distinguished by its
application to multiple regions and institutions of higher education, thus establishing generalizable
results (Luger & Goldstein, 1997; Malecki & Bradbury, 1992). Surveys have been used to examine
a variety of university impacts, including the ways in which different industries utilize public
research, the impact of regional scientific and human capital, job formation, and the importance
of university-industry collaborations (e.g., Bozeman, 2000; Salter & Martin, 2001; Varga, 1997).
Several surveys reveal that firms tend to identify universities as an important factor in location
choice and spin-off success (Smilor, Gibson, & Dietrich, 1990; Varga, 1997). By examining a survey of research and development laboratories in the United States, Adams (2002) finds that knowledge spillovers originating from universities are more geographically localized than those from
industrial research efforts, a result seconded by Beugelsdijk and Cornet (2002) for the Netherlands. Surveys conducted of German and Spanish firms, however, show the frequency of
university-industry collaborations and industrial innovations to be more closely aligned with the
intensity of research and development within firms than with proximity to research institutions
(Beise & Stahl, 1999; Sáez, Marco, & Arribas, 2002).
Perhaps the most prominent use of surveys has been to utilize the annual collection of technology transfer data in the United States by the Association of University Technology Managers
(AUTM). For instance, Jamison and Jansen (2000) demonstrate the sizeable impact of the BayhDole Act in stimulating university technology development activities across the nation, whereas
Blumenstyk (2002) and Carlsson and Fridh (2002) use AUTM data to examine the characteristics
of universities that have been successful in technology transfer. Rogers, Yin, and Hoffman (2000)
specifically link the effectiveness of university technology transfer offices with faculty salaries,
donations, and the capture of federal and industrial research funding.
Survey research is far less common in the university impact literature than case studies, and the
approach has only modestly extended the results achieved with case studies. Because of the costs,
surveys tend to focus on a single area of university activity. Survey questions aimed at the attribution problem suffer from obvious validity threats such as respondent ignorance or bias (Salter &
Martin, 2001). Attempts to generalize across universities and regions have been ambiguous in that
the impacts seem to depend on various national, regional, industry, and university characteristics
(Adams, 2002; Varga, 1997).
Economists, in particular, have adopted a different tactic by estimating econometric knowledge
production functions. Drawing from the earlier work of Solow (1957) and Arrow (1962) concerning the importance of knowledge and technology in aggregate production functions, Griliches
(1979) and Jaffe (1989) established the configuration that forms the basis for most current econometric knowledge production research. The Griliches-Jaffe methodology describes a CobbDouglas production function for knowledge with patents as the measure of innovation constituting

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY / February 2006

the dependent variable and industry and university research and development expenditures as two
independent variables.
Many researchers subsequently have modified and extended the Griliches-Jaffe model to obtain
a wide variety of results. For instance, Riddel and Schwer (2003) demonstrate that industry research
and university degrees, but not university research, serve to stimulate patents in technology-based
fields, whereas Acs, Audretsch, and Feldman (1994) show that university research and development have greater impacts for small firms than for large firms and that these effects differ across
industrial sectors. Varga (1998, 2000, 2001) details the importance of agglomeration (as proxied
by population or employment) in allowing technology-intensive firms to take advantage of university research. Numerous studies have focused on the importance of spatial proximity in facilitating
the economic impacts of university knowledge production. Jaffe (1989) finds that the effects of
university research on corporate patents are mediated by spatial location—proximity to university
research matters to corporate patents. Patent citation patterns suggest that knowledge diffusion is
geographically localized in both the United States and Europe (Fischer & Varga, 2003; Hall, Jaffe,
& Trajtenberg, 2000; Jaffe & Trajtenberg, 1996; Jaffe, Trajtenberg, & Henderson, 1993). Start-up
firms tend to be more geographically localized than other outcomes of university knowledge production (Candell & Jaffe, 1999). Anselin, Varga, and Acs (1997) find that universities have a large
attractor effect on research laboratories, and Sivitanidou and Sivitanides (1995) reach a similar
result for private research laboratories at the intraregional scale.
Overall, econometric analyses have demonstrated that knowledge, as an output, has qualities
that make it unique. As such, knowledge-producing organizations must be considered differently
from other large organizations. External benefits of knowledge production in the form of spatial
spillovers lead to increased innovation among regional firms, although with considerable variety
across studies in the measured magnitude and significance of this effect. Regional agglomeration
economies may be important in enabling private sector industries to absorb and benefit from university research. As to the methodological approach, restrictive assumptions such as production
function form and components and the suitability of proxies for complex concepts provide structure but may be difficult to justify empirically. Measurement and data availability issues limit the
ability of econometric studies to separate the impacts of different university activities. Although
the results of econometric studies are more easily generalizable than case studies, most of the economic research concentrates on the technological innovation outputs of universities, neglecting the
other ways in which universities contribute to regional economic development.
Cross-sectional analyses are less restrictive than econometric analyses. Simply put, researchers
select a sample from the full population or sampling frame and statistically analyze the relationships between variables. The primary advantage of the cross-sectional approach is flexibility,
because few modeling assumptions are imposed; its disadvantages include susceptibility to sampling issues and omitted variable bias.
In the context of the regional economic development impacts of higher education institutions,
cross-sectional designs are most commonly employed in the absence of established theory to guide
the formation of explicit models. Cross-sectional studies have provided ambiguous results about
the tendency of technology-intensive firms to locate near universities, perhaps because of the
industrial classification schemes conflating routine production tasks with knowledge-dependent
activities such as research and development (Varga, 1997, discusses Audretsch & Stephan, 1996;
Bania, Eberts, & Fogarty, 1993; Glasmeier, 1991; Markusen, Hall, & Glasmeier, 1986). University
and industry patents do tend to be colocated within regions, at least within certain fields (Agrawal
& Cockburn, 2003). Regression-based analyses of citation patterns suggest the importance of
proximity in supporting university-industry joint research efforts and other collaborations,
although the effects are relatively weak and vary across industries and nations (e.g., Spencer, 2001;
Tornquist & Hoenack, 1996).
New-firm formation has also been studied with cross-sectional methods, again leading to divergent results (Varga, 1997). Florax (1992) and Florax and Folmer (1992) use investments in
manufacturing equipment and buildings as proxies of firm presence, finding no relationship to university proximity in 40 regions in the Netherlands. Bania et al. (1993), examining 25 metropolitan
areas in the United States, find significant effects of university research on new-firm births for the

electrical and electronic equipment but not the instruments industry. By examining new-firm births
using U.S. Census microdata, Kirchhoff, Armington, Hasan, and Newbert (2002) demonstrate that
university research does spur the creation of new firms. Regional population, a proxy for agglomeration economies, is revealed to have a substantial positive influence as well. Several studies,
however, have demonstrated that the dependence of firm births on university activity varies by
industry sector and field (e.g., Harhoff, 1999; Swann & Prevezer, 1996; Zucker, Darby, & Brewer,
1998).
In contrast to cross-sectional analyses, quasi-experimental designs attempt to mimic the conditions for true experiments as closely as possible in field settings (Cook & Campbell, 1979;
Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002). Before introducing statistical controls for possibly intervening factors, researchers attempt to control their influence by strategically manipulating the study
population, time period, and sampling so as to either maximize or eliminate variation in rival factors, thus reducing the probability of omitted-variable biases. In studies of the economic impacts
of institutions of higher education, the regional distribution of universities by size and type would
represent the treatment variable. A control group might consist of a set of regions lacking significant knowledge-producing organizations or a different set of regions possessing types of knowledge organizations other than research universities. Although control group cases cannot be
assumed, as with true experiments, to be equivalent to the treatment cases in all respects except for
the treatment itself, comparing gain scores—differences in the outcome variables over time, that is,
between a pretest and posttest—takes the different starting positions into account.
Quasi-experimental designs have appeared occasionally in regional research (e.g., Isserman,
1987; Isserman & Merrifield, 1987), but to the authors’ knowledge, only one study has explicitly
used a quasi-experimental design to estimate the contributions of knowledge-producing organizations to regional economic development outcomes. Goldstein and Renault (2004) contrast U.S.
regional wage growth between the 1969-to-1986 and 1986-to-1998 periods, with 1986 as a break
point corresponding to the widespread adoption of entrepreneurial activities in research universities. They find universities to have a significant influence only in the period from 1986 to 1998 and
conclude that the entrepreneurial activities of universities are more important for economic development than the traditional functions such as human capital creation and regional leadership that
were present in both time periods. In addition, by separating regions by total employment size, they
produce mixed evidence of the relationship between agglomeration economies and university
influence. The interaction between employment size and university research is not significant in
either time period, and regional size has a positive effect, supporting the contention that agglomeration economies are more important than universities in stimulating economic development. Only
in the smaller regions, however, is there a significant difference in the period from 1986 to 1998
between areas with and without a major research university, suggesting that universities may
sometimes substitute for agglomeration.

METHOD
Objectives and Design
The fundamental purpose of this study is to estimate the effects of universities on regional economic well-being. To do so, we separate the influences of different university functions as much as
possible while controlling for other regional development factors. Although we are not able to distinguish among all of the eight functions identified by Goldstein et al. (1995) within the constraints
of our data set, we do employ measures that serve to isolate the traditional functions of knowledge
and human capital creation from the newer university mission of technology development. This
approach extends previous research by supporting stronger and more general claims about the relative importance of these university activities in influencing economic development outcomes at the
regional level. In addition, we investigate the possibility that university activities depend on (or
conversely, substitute for) regional agglomeration economies, and we examine the impacts of spatial spillovers arising from universities and other economic activities in nearby regions. The rela-

tionship between agglomeration and university impacts has been addressed primarily in qualitative fashion in the literature, whereas analyses of university spillovers have concentrated on
technological innovation and transfer activities.
The unit of analysis is the metropolitan statistical area (MSA). All variables (described below)
are measured on an MSA basis. The study population consists of 313 MSAs within the contiguous
United States, based on the 1999 definitions by the U.S. Census Bureau.1 The time period of the
analysis is from 1986 to 2001. 2
The study methodology combines characteristics of cross-sectional and quasi-experimental
designs. We include all available MSAs (except for five outliers) as the study population in order to
maximize both variation in the measured indicators and external validity. Because of the geographic dispersion of university activities, particularly teaching, across all MSAs, it is not possible
to use regions that lack university influences as control groups. Instead, we include several measures of university functions in a multivariate regression context. The dependent variable is calculated as the change or gain score in the outcome variable over the time period to further account for
the nonequivalence of the study regions.
We pose three research hypotheses, each pertaining to one of the central research questions presented earlier. First, although the technological development role of higher education institutions
has been strongly emphasized in recent years, we postulate that the traditional university missions—teaching and basic research—remain the dominant mechanisms by which universities
affect regional economic development. Second, we suggest that spatial spillovers from universities
and from other regional economic activities are important in influencing the economic development of nearby regions. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of university activities are leveraged by regional agglomeration economies. In other words, all else equal, university impacts are
larger in the presence of greater agglomerations of resources and economic activity.
We present estimates obtained from two models. The first model, designed to address the first
two hypotheses, is a multivariate regression focused on university and regional variables that
includes indicators of possible spatial spillovers among regions. The second model partitions the
MSAs by size to consider the third research question of whether university impacts depend on or
leverage agglomeration economies.3 This second approach also supports a more detailed examination of the first two hypotheses based on regional size. Both models are estimated using maximum
likelihood methods to correct for spatial dependence. 4
Dependent Variable
Our measure of regional economic development is based on the average annual earnings per
non–farm worker.5 In contrast to per capita income, per worker earnings take only earned income
into account, excluding other sources of income such as rents, dividends, interest, and government
transfer payments. These latter sources of income may skew per capita income measures in regions
with large numbers of retirees, disabled persons, veterans, or economically inactive residents. By
choosing average earnings per worker, we focus on the quality of regional jobs as the gauge of
regional economic well-being.
To separate the dependent variable from changes in macroeconomic conditions over the time
period of the analysis, including shifts in the dollar’s nominal value and regional purchasing
power, we first adjust average annual earnings per worker using the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
series.6 We then construct a normalized index by calculating each MSA’s CPI-adjusted average
earnings per worker as a percentage of the corresponding CPI-adjusted figure for the United States
as a whole.7 Finally, the dependent variable is calculated as the change in the normalized index
value between 1986 and 2001.
As an example, consider that the average earnings per worker in the Rochester (New York)
MSA in 1986 was $21,543. The corresponding figure for the United States was $19,630. After
adjusting by the Northeast Urban CPI (for Rochester) and the U.S. City Average CPI (for the
United States), these become $19,391 and $17,911 in 1982 to 1984 dollars, respectively. The index
value for the Rochester MSA is $19,391 divided by $17,911, or 108.3%, indicating that Rochester’s normalized and price-adjusted 1986 average earnings per worker is 8.3% higher than for the

Downloaded from http://edq.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on September 30, 2008

<-----Page 8----->Goldstein, Drucker / ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

nation. The same calculation for 2001 yields a value of 91.7% for the Rochester MSA. Thus, the
dependent variable for Rochester has a value of –16.6.
Constructing the dependent variable as the change in the index value over the study period helps
to control for some of the local factors endemic to particular regions that account for the
nonequivalence of the study areas. For instance, small MSAs that contain large universities may
have relatively large numbers of students employed in low-wage, part-time jobs, holding down the
average earnings per worker. (Conversely, they may have unusually large proportions of specialized, highly paid university employees that raise average earnings.) Considering differences over
time rather than levels of average earnings should minimize this type of distortion.
It is interesting to note that the coefficient of variation for the normalized index increased from
1986 to 2001 from 0.1209 to 0.1663. At the same time, there is a significant and positive relationship between index values in 1986 and 2001.8 Thus, regional positions with respect to the normalized index have tended to remain similar over time (the example given of Rochester, New York, is
an exception), with widening variance across the 313 MSAs included in the study. This leads to a
conjecture of cumulative causation that is revisited below in the section on conditioning and
control variables.
Measures of University Presence
We employ four university-related variables to investigate different university functions that
affect regional economic development. First, the total amount of research expenditures, compiled
on an annual basis by the National Science Foundation, indicates research and development activities.9 Total research expenditures is a typical choice as a measure of university knowledge production due to its ready availability and comparability across institutions (Varga, 1997).
The creation of human capital is measured with two different variables.10 The first is the total
number of degrees awarded within the region in science and technology fields at the bachelor’s
level or higher.11 Because of high variable multicollinearity, it is not possible to include a count of
science and technology degrees along with either degrees in all subjects or degrees in nonscience
fields and obtain reliable coefficient estimates. Therefore, the second variable included is the ratio
of graduate-level degrees in science and technology fields to the total number of undergraduate and
graduate degrees awarded in all fields. Together, these two measures indicate both the relative
amount of human capital creation and the extent to which regional university teaching activity
focuses on graduate studies in science and technology fields, the type of instruction most directly
applicable to knowledge-intensive industry employment.
Finally, the fourth measure of university activity is the number of patents assigned to universities within the MSA.12 This variable enables us to separate the technology-development aspect
from the more traditional function of the university in conducting basic research. Although, as a
proxy for university-based technological development, patent measures have their share of faults
(for instance, the act of obtaining a patent suggests only potential technological usefulness without
ensuring that innovations are commercially relevant), there are no better measures available
nationwide at a regional or institutional level of disaggregation. Earlier research suggests that patents are related to the market value of knowledge and knowledge spillovers from universities
(Agrawal & Cockburn, 2003; Goldstein & Renault, 2004).
By utilizing four indicators that pertain specifically to three of the university functions detailed
earlier, we are able to separate the impacts of institutions of higher education according to three of
their primary outputs: teaching, basic research, and technology development. There are two shortcomings to acknowledge. First, as mentioned before, data constraints as well as multicollinearity
preclude us from including indicators to measure the other university functions. Second, the
selected proxies are necessarily imperfect and may capture some effects of the otherwise omitted
(but often codirectional) university outputs. For instance, regions with fast-growing universities
might evidence earnings gains because of rising university employment and payroll (direct effects)
as well as from increases in research activity and human capital creation. In such a case, the estimated coefficients of the university variables may overstate the influence of the measured university functions.13 This confounding issue is perhaps most likely in smaller metropolitan areas domi-

nated by relatively large research universities, such as Iowa City, Iowa, or Columbia, Missouri.
Data show, however, that on average, salaries for full-time instructional faculty and staff in all
degree-granting institutions have been essentially flat (in constant dollars) from 1987-1988 to
1998-1999 (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2001). Although there is undoubtedly variation in the amount of change in faculty salaries among institutions, we find no evidence that our
dependent variable measure would be systematically biased by faculty salary growth exceeding
the growth rate of all earnings during our study period.
As discussed earlier, the issue of spatial spillovers has received attention in numerous empirical
studies, with widely varying results. Because spillovers may extend not only within but across
closely situated regions, we consider two measures of proximate university activity. First, we
include a count of the number of MSAs (inclusive of the reference MSA) within 60 miles of the reference region as a very basic indicator of the level of proximity to other regions.14, 15 This measure
combines possible interregional spillovers of university influences, including basic knowledge
creation and regional leadership, as well as nonuniversity agglomeration economies such as labor
pooling and specialized input availability. Second, because many graduates may remain near the
university but not necessarily within the particular MSA, we include the total number of graduatelevel science degrees awarded in all MSAs within 45 miles of the reference region. Because theory
and previous research suggest the existence of knowledge and human capital spillovers but provide
no consistent guidance as to their spatial extent, several distance cutoffs were tested, and the measures for the final model were selected on the basis of the quality of the fit obtained.16 Spillover
measures corresponding to other university variables included above, such as degrees in all fields,
the ratio of graduate science to total degrees, and research and development expenditures in neighboring regions, were also tested in an attempt to further separate spillovers by university activity,
but they were either highly colinear with the two selected proximity variables or provided little
additional explanatory power.17
Conditioning and Control Variables
There are numerous other factors that may influence the extent to which university activities
translate to regional economic outcomes. As discussed earlier, agglomeration economies may help
firms and industries to utilize university knowledge products efficiently. There may be a threshold
level below which agglomeration effects are negligible or with diminishing returns to increased
agglomeration beyond that point. We proxy agglomeration economies by the natural logarithm of
total MSA employment at the beginning of the time period. We include the baseline level of the
dependent variable (the CPI-adjusted normalized index of average earnings per worker in 1986) to
account for the possibility of cumulative causation—regions that start ahead subsequently may
tend to reap larger gains. The regional population growth rate over the study time period is added as
a measure of regional dynamism because regions that experience more rapid changes inherently
have greater opportunities for economic development.18, 19
Regional industry structure may play a pivotal role, both in establishing the basic capacity for
regional economic development and in providing more specific agglomeration economies. We
include two particular dimensions of industry structure: the percentage of regional earnings in
manufacturing and the percentage of earnings in business services. Each of these two dimensions
is represented both by the percentage of regional earnings accounted for at the start of the time
period and the change in the percentage earnings over the study period.20, 21 Manufacturing is the
economic sector most likely to be able to appropriate advances in basic knowledge and technological know-how for economic gains in the short term. The other dimension, business services,
roughly indicates available regional agglomeration economies.
Entrepreneurial activity is often discussed as crucial to economic success, particularly in
knowledge-intensive sectors, yet is very difficult to measure at the regional level with secondary
data sources (Acs, 1996; Malecki, 1991). We include two measures that, although not ideal, begin
to approach the concept of entrepreneurial activity. First, the percentage of regional earnings generated by sole proprietorships (i.e., self-employed individuals) indicates small-business activity,
which is strongly related to entrepreneurialism (Malecki, 1991). The change in this percentage

Downloaded from http://edq.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on September 30, 2008

<-----Page 10----->Goldstein, Drucker / ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

over the study period is included as well. Second, the count of commercial patents awarded annually to private sector entities takes into account the innovative, technology-creation aspect of entrepreneurial behavior.22
It is possible that the amount and type of research and development performed by industry in
each metropolitan region may affect either the overall gains in average earnings directly or the
extent to which academic research is performed and converted into economic gains. Jaffe (1989)
found some statistical evidence of academic research supporting industrial research activity in the
context of a model explaining knowledge production as measured by state-level patenting rates.
Unfortunately, very little data exist on industrial research and development activity at the metropolitan level. The only variable available for use in this study as a proxy for industrial research and
development is a count of the number of private sector research laboratories by metropolitan area
in 1985 (National Research Council, 1985). This indicator did not add significantly to the models
presented in the next section and so is omitted; tests of the endogeneity of industrial and academic
research activities were also negative.
The base educational level of the population may also be a contributing factor to regional economic success. We include the percentage of the older-than-25 population with a college degree
(bachelor’s level or higher), as well as the percentage of those without a college degree that have
obtained at least high school equivalency. Both of these variables are taken from the 2000 Decennial Census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). 23
Some measure of geographic or economic “centrality” is traditionally included in explanatory
studies of regional growth. Accessibility to suppliers, markets, and information sources is a key
factor in promoting economic vitality, though centrality may mean different things in different
economic sectors. Given the importance of high-speed transportation and face-to-face communication in modern knowledge-based industries, we use air transportation to indicate centrality. Specifically, we include dummies to denote whether each MSA is classified by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics as a small, medium, or large air hub.24
Quality of life is often discussed as an attribute that aids in economic success by attracting entrepreneurs, high-quality workers, and talent to the region. Quantitative measures of the quality-oflife concept vary tremendously in the literature. Due to the constraints imposed by the geographic
unit of analysis chosen for this study, we incorporated three indices taken from the Places Rated
Almanac (Savageau, 2000) that broadly measure the attractiveness of the regional environment in
terms of crime, health care access, and climate for each metropolitan area.25
Finally, there may be geographic variations that the CPI adjustments and other control variables
do not fully take into account. For example, the broad shifts in population and investment from the
Northeast and Midwest to the West and South that began in the 1950s and 1960s continued
throughout the study time period. Dummies for major census regions control for such remaining
macroregional variations.26 Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all the variables used in this
analysis.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Combined Model
The first model examines all the MSAs together (see Table 2). It was estimated using maximum
likelihood techniques, implementing a spatial error model to correct for spatial dependency in the
data.27 Metropolitan areas that are located relatively near to each other may tend to have similar values of the dependent variable, even accounting for the proximity measures and other explanatory
variables included in the model. The postulated model fits quite well, explaining more than two
thirds of the variation in the dependent variable. Most of the statistically significant coefficients
indicate impacts that follow the directions suggested by theory and previous research.28
Three of the four measures of university activity are statistically significant in explaining MSA
variation in the change in average earnings. Research and development expenditures are strongly
related to increases in regional average earnings, but the scale of the effect is relatively small. For

example, in the “average” region, an additional $10 million in annual university research expenditures represents a 37% increase in funding but raises the earnings index by only 0.23 over 15 years.
In contrast, the median change in the earnings index across the 313 study regions from 1986 to
2001 was –4.51. The coefficient of the count of science degrees is negative, but higher percentages
of graduate science degrees among all degrees awarded are associated with increases in the
regional index of average earnings. Together, this suggests that producing too many degrees at all
levels reduces relative earnings, perhaps by enlarging the qualified workforce and flooding the
labor market. Given a particular number of graduates, however, concentrating available educational resources in science and technology fields and at the graduate level is advantageous for
regional development. University patenting activity does not yield a significant effect. The conclusion to be drawn from the first model is qualified support for the first hypothesis: The traditional
outputs of knowledge and human capital are the primary means by which institutions of higher
education effect economic development outcomes.
The second hypothesis—the importance of interregional spillovers in regional economic development—is clearly demonstrated by the two proximity-based measures. The number of graduatelevel science degrees awarded in MSAs within 45 miles is strongly associated with rises in regional
average earnings; the number of MSAs within 60 miles is positively associated and just barely
misses significance at the 10% level. Science and technology education occurring in neighboring
regions aids in regional development, as many graduates select employment options in nearby
MSAs. Proximity to other MSAs includes spillovers of university as well as other types of eco-

nomic activities, generally representing access to resources supportive of economic development
outcomes. These findings indicate that the spatial gradient of university impacts may be substantially flatter than indicated in previous research—stretching across neighboring regions. This
phenomenon may be of particular benefit to areas that do not contain major research universities
themselves, such as Youngstown, Ohio, or New London, Connecticut. Unfortunately, variable
multicollinearity prevented including more specific measures of university spillovers in the model.
Several other regional factors help explain average earnings changes. Other things being equal,
regions that start with higher average earnings exhibit smaller increases over the study period, contradicting the conjecture of cumulative causation. Regions with lower relative earnings may have
had more room for improvement and succeeded in securing the initial “easy” benefits from economic development efforts. Agglomeration economies and industry structure are important:
Larger base employment, greater shares of regional earnings accruing to business services and to
manufacturing, and increases in the shares of business services and manufacturing earnings are all
positively related to regional development. Because most regions experienced declines in the share
of manufacturing earnings (279 of the 313 MSAs), the last variable for these areas may be interpreted as indicating that declines in manufacturing’s share of earnings inhibit regional earnings
growth. As expected, rapid population change and commercial patenting support greater gains in
average earnings, but the estimated coefficients of proprietorships’share of earnings and change in

share are negative, perhaps indicating that regional entrepreneurialism supports employment
rather than earnings, at least in the short run. 29
One counterintuitive result is that greater high school–level education among the noncollegeeducated portion of the workforce is a significantly negative factor. Perhaps those with high
school–equivalent educations are less willing than those without to accept employment in lowpaid jobs, such as those available in the service sector. Finally, it is worth noting that only one of the
census region dummies is significant, which suggests that the adjustments made to the dependent
variable to account for regional price differentials removed most but not all regional macroeconomic differences.30
Partitioned Model
The second model partitions the 313 MSAs by size before applying the same regression analysis techniques as in the first model.31 The size categories are based on 1986 levels of regional
employment. The three categories are selected as an attempt to compromise between the competing objectives of classifying the MSAs by different levels of potential agglomeration and retaining
sufficient cases and degrees of freedom in each category to support the regressions. Fewer variables are significant than in the previous two models because of the reduced sample size used in
each regression.
The results are sharply different across the three partitions (Table 3 compares the estimates; the
full results are presented in Tables 4-6).32 For the large MSAs, the most important variables are
business services, the change in the share of earnings from business services, educational attainment, and the starting employment level. In terms of university activities, the ratio of graduate science degrees and the spillover of graduate science degrees from neighboring MSAs have positive
influences, but science degrees awarded within the region depress earnings gains. The number of
nearby MSAs and population growth are positively related to average earnings gains, with estimated coefficients greater in magnitude than in the unpartitioned model.
The medium-sized MSAs evidence powerful influences from within-region university activities: university research and development expenditures (very strongly positive), science degrees
(strongly negative), the ratio of graduate science degrees to all degrees (strongly positive), and university patenting (strongly negative). The $10-million hypothetical increase in university research
expenditures that raises the average region’s index by 0.23 in the first model serves to augment the
earnings index for the typical medium-sized MSA by 1.01. The medium category seems to represent the size for which a research base is extremely important to regional economic development,
to the extent that university participation in other activities such as education and patenting actually
detracts from that support. Herein is an answer to the question of whether university activities
leverage regional agglomeration economies. The larger MSAs benefit only slightly from withinregion university research and development, whereas these medium-sized regions benefit substantially. In other words, this evidence contradicts the third hypothesis presented above and instead suggests that university activities may serve as substitutes for agglomeration economies. ChampaignUrbana, Illinois, and Charlottesville, Virginia, are possible examples of this phenomenon. Each is
a medium-sized region boasting a major research university that has enjoyed above-average earnings gains during the time period of the analysis. Most of the remaining significant variables,
including business services and manufacturing earnings, have the influences expected from the
earlier models.
For the small MSAs, the total amount of graduate science degrees awarded in the surrounding MSAs (together with the reference region) and the extent to which within-region teaching is
focused on graduate-level science and technology fields both have positive effects. University research and development are significantly negatively related to earnings change. In contrast, university patenting activity is positive in effect. The conclusion to be drawn with respect to the first
research hypothesis is opposite from that suggested by the unpartitioned model: Small MSAs may
benefit more directly (at least in terms of earnings) from university technology development and
teaching activities than from basic research. Thus, the relative importance of the measured university activities to economic development outcomes differs with the size of the host region. Corvallis,

Oregon, presents an excellent example of a small region that is home to a university heavily
engaged in technology development. Starting size (represented by the logarithm of employment)
is important within the small MSA category, probably due as much to the fact that the category has
no lower size boundary as to a threshold or critical mass effect (this reasoning holds true for the
large-MSA size category as well).
Overall, regarding the third hypothesis, there is little evidence that the effect of university activities on regional economic development outcomes depends on agglomeration economies, at least
as proxied by regional employment size. Indeed, though all three MSA size categories exhibit a
positive influence from graduate science intensity, medium MSAs show the most benefit from
university research activity, and only the small MSAs gain with university technology development. Rather, this presents positive support for the idea that university activities can substitute for
agglomeration economies. The results also demonstrate that the answer to the first research question depends on regional size: Technology development is as important as the more traditional university missions of research and teaching in the small but not the medium or large MSAs. As to
the second hypothesis, all three size regions exhibit positive spatial spillover effects. Nevertheless, factors such as supporting business services and overall population growth remain the most

regions.

CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
This research makes use of a relatively simple analytical framework combining elements of
cross-sectional and quasi-experimental research designs to test the importance of universities in
determining regional economic development trajectories in the United States since the mid-1980s.
The empirical results suggest that the university activities of research, teaching, and technology
development help to raise regional average earnings and that knowledge and other spillovers
across regional boundaries are influential as well. This serves as at least a partial validation of state
and local policies designed to improve economic circumstances by creating or bolstering the economic development function as well as the more traditional research and human capital creation
activities of regional universities.
The effects of universities within the region are found to be particularly important in small- and
medium-sized MSAs, those containing fewer than 200,000 nonfarm jobs. The behavior of average
earnings in larger regions is more dependent on nonuniversity factors such as business services and

starting employment level. Presumably, the fact that universities constitute a much smaller proportion of total innovative activity in the larger MSAs means that they are a less crucial ingredient in
regional economic advancement. Human capital formation, particularly at the graduate level in
science and technology fields, also raises average earnings in smaller MSAs. The evidence
implies, however, that too many degree awards can detract from earnings gains by glutting the local
labor market or by taking resources away from other more influential university functions. If maximizing positive economic development impacts is a priority mission for universities, teaching
functions should be tailored to match the skill demands of the local labor market.33
Despite the importance of university influences, factors external to universities, including the
stock of business services and the educational attainment level, remain the most influential determinants of regional economic progress over all size regions. Agglomeration economies, such as
those measured by business services and the base employment level, are significant as well. There
are indications, however, that the knowledge-based activities of universities can act as a substitute
for regional agglomeration economies in small- and medium-sized regions rather than relying on a
critical level of available urbanization economies existing to be able to influence regional economic development outcomes.
The key advance from this study is the deliberate separation of the regional economic impacts
of different university activities. The strength of the research design in terms of external validity is

also its weakness in that the selection of measures is limited by the availability of secondary data on
a nationwide basis. Using a similar approach, future research might seek to incorporate additional
data sets or create more refined indicators of university activities and other regional factors to more
closely measure the impacts of the various university functions in particular regional settings.
It would be informative to perform cross-national studies to extend the results to a broader set
of advanced industrial economies and types of higher education institutions. By combining the
results from this and future studies based on similar research designs with evidence obtained using
alternative assumptions and methodologies, we can continue to expand and refine our understanding of the processes by which universities affect their regions and the factors that mediate that
influence.

NOTES
1. We treat primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) and New England consolidated metropolitan areas
(NECMAs) as equivalent to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). There are 318 MSAs, PMSAs, and NECMAs according
to the 1999 census definitions (based on the 1990 census). This study includes all but 5. The Chicago, Los Angeles, and New
York PMSAs are excluded as outliers because of their size. Within these metropolitan areas, the sheer volume of economic
activity must overwhelm the contributions of local universities. In addition, for the very largest cities, it is difficult to argue
that census metropolitan area boundaries appropriately approximate functional economic areas. (The values of the relevant

<-----Page 18----->Goldstein, Drucker / ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

variables from these PMSAs are, however, incorporated into the spatial spillover variables.) Anchorage and Honolulu are
also omitted because of their economic and geographical isolation as well as peculiarities of county and census area
boundaries in Alaska and Hawaii.
2. This time period is selected to begin when public universities began to substantially incorporate entrepreneurial and
economic development activities as part of their missions (Bozeman, 2000; Feller, 1990; Mowery, Nelson, Sampat, &
Ziedonis, 1999).
3. Another reasonable and intuitive strategy for investigating the third hypothesis is to incorporate one or more interaction terms into the nonpartitioned model. Our attempts to follow this alternative approach, however, yielded very poor
results. Interaction terms were added (separately) to the first model to explore the differential influence of university activities based on MSA size, manufacturing intensity, and starting average earnings in 1986. The results were uniformly unsatisfactory, both in terms of significance and often also by flipping the coefficient signs for the noninteracted independent
variables.
4. This is solely an error correction technique and does not pertain to the spatial spillover hypothesis; please see Note 17
below.
5. The data for this and the other regional economic indicators used in this study are available from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS) of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/regional/reis).
6. For each MSA, the adjustment is made using the most closely applicable Consumer Price Index (CPI) series. MSAs
within the largest PMSAs (e.g., Atlanta, Cleveland, Denver, Houston, San Francisco) have their own series, whereas smaller
MSAs are categorized by major census region. For instance, the CPI series that most closely matches the Tucson MSA is
West Urban. The overall U.S. City Average series is used to adjust the U.S. average earnings per worker. The base (reference) period for each of these series is 1982-1984. The CPI series are compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://
www.bls.gov/cpi).
7. The average earnings per nonfarm worker for the United States does include regions excluded from the study population, namely, the five MSAs omitted as outliers as well as all nonmetropolitan counties. We constructed an alternate dependent variable by normalizing each MSA’s figure as a percentage of the population-weighted average of the average earnings
per worker of the 313 MSAs used in the study. Regression analyses conducted with this alternate dependent variable yielded
negligible changes in results.
8. The correlation coefficient between the 1986 and 2001 index is 0.8430. A simple univariate regression of the 2001
index value on the 1986 value yielded a coefficient of 1.1076 with standard error 0.0401 and t-statistic 27.64.
9. These data are available through the CASPAR database (http://caspar.nsf.gov).
10. The pertinent data are collected by the National Center for Educational Statistics as part of the Integrated PostSecondary Education Data System. These data are also available through the CASPAR database. Because the data are available beginning only with 1987 graduates, we associate 1987 figures with the beginning of the study time period in 1986.
11. We classify the following two-digit categories from the 1990 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) taxonomy as science and technology fields: agricultural sciences (02), biological and life sciences (26), communications technologies (10), computer and information sciences (11), engineering (14), health professions and related sciences (51), mathematics (27), physical sciences (40), and science technologies (41).
12. The information is obtained from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/
oeip/taf/brochure.htm).
13. Estimating across the study population of metropolitan regions, this effect may create some degree of upward bias
in the coefficients of the measures of university presence because the institutions that are growing the most in terms of
research, teaching, and technology development activity will also tend to be those hiring personnel and adding to their payrolls. Lacking separate indicators of the other university outputs, we have no way to measure the degree of such bias within
the framework of this research. Our thanks to an anonymous reviewer for pointing out this possibility.
14. Distances are calculated as great circle distances between MSA centroids. MSA spatial boundaries are from the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing files of the U.S. Census Bureau, translated into ArcView format and distributed by the Environmental Systems Research Institute.
15. We also tested a set of size-based measures, such as the total nonfarm employment in MSAs within various distances
of the reference MSA, but the simple unweighted count measure yielded superior results.
16. Both 45 and 60 miles lie within what is ordinarily considered to be an easy commuting distance, such as from downtown Detroit to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
17. We should note that in the context of a model that explicitly includes indicators of spatial spillovers as independent
variables, spatial error regression is simply an error-correction technique and does not produce a substantive interpretation.
Any remaining spatial autocorrelation beyond that which is accounted for by the spatial spillover variables cannot be
explained within the regression context and acts only as an obfuscation of the correct coefficient standard errors.
18. Rapidly changing areas are able to incorporate innovations to a greater degree than are more slowly changing or stagnant regions simply because there is less bulk remaining in place. This fact is widely recognized in fields such as computing
and communications technologies (rapid obsolescence spurs adoption of the newest technologies), education (higher
instructor turnover speeds changes in curricula), and infrastructure and land-use planning (rapidly growing cities have more
opportunities to restructure the built environment) and is no less true in terms of economic restructuring and development.
19. Population change is calculated between the closest decennial census years, 1990 to 2000. Because it is possible that
population change is endogenous to the model (regions with greater economic success may attract in-migrants or, less probably, have higher birth or survival rates), each of the models was reanalyzed omitting the population change variable. All
results were very similar to those presented in the text: No signs were changed for any significant variables, and significance
levels were only slightly altered.

20. Due to data suppression by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the share of earnings to manufacturing figures were
not available for the year 2001 for nine MSAs. For these MSAs, the end-of-the-study-period figure was approximated by the
latest nonsuppressed information: Asheville (2000), Charlottesville (1997), Cincinnati (2000), Columbus, Georgia (1997),
Flagstaff (1997), Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News (2000), Santa Fe (2000), Seattle (2000), and Washington (1998).
21. The latest year available for share of earnings to business services was 2000. Due to data suppression by the Bureau
of Economic Analysis, the business earnings share figures were not available for 2000 for eight MSAs. For these MSAs, the
end-of-the-study-period figure was approximated by the latest nonsuppressed information: Augusta-Aiken (1999), Cincinnati
(1997), Columbus, Ohio (1999), Huntington-Ashland (1999), Knoxville (1997), Macon (1997), Sarasota-Bradenton
(1999), and Terre Haute (1994).
22. Commercial patent data are taken from the U.S. Patent Citations Data File compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research (http://www.nber.org/patents). The data are organized from original U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data
files and are described in detail in Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001).
23. The 2000 census data were used because of the need for concordance with the 1999 MSA definitions used in this
study. Although 1990 data would have been preferable in terms of more closely matching the starting point of the time
period of analysis, the 2000 figures still present a reasonable measure because changes in the educational attainment level
occur quite slowly for the entire older-than-25 population. Nevertheless, to check for possible endogeneity, both of the models were recalculated omitting the education variables. The signs of the other coefficients remained unchanged, and the significance levels changed only slightly.
24. The reference category is no air hub. MSAs with multiple airports were assigned the largest categorization. The data
are available in the annual publication Airport Activity Statistics, formerly published by the Federal Aviation Agency and
now produced by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This research adopts the 1986 classification (Federal Aviation
Agency, 1986).
25. The crime index is based on the incidence of violent and property crimes. The health care index is based on the number of family care physicians, specialists, surgeons, hospital beds, certified hospitals, and certified teaching hospitals per
capita. The climate index is based on the number of below-32-degree and above-90-degree (Fahrenheit) days, seasonal
affect (cloudiness, precipitation, fog, sunlight), and frequency of hazardous weather. All three indices range from 0 to 100,
with 100 as the most attractive. Two MSAs were not included in the almanac: Auburn-Opelika (Alabama) and Corvallis
(Oregon). These were assigned the index values of their nearest neighboring MSAs, namely, Montgomery for AuburnOpelika and Eugene for Corvallis, both approximately 50 miles distant.
26. The dummies are for the Midwest, the South, and the West. The reference region is the Northeast.
27. Values of the global Moran’s I and Geary’s C statistics were computed to diagnose spatial dependence in the dependent variable. The standard deviations of these statistics were calculated both by assuming a normal distribution and by
using a random location assumption. Each statistic indicated significant positive spatial correlation. The model was estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial error, and spatial lag regression techniques. LaGrange multiplier diagnostics performed on the OLS regressions favored a spatial error rather than a spatial lag interpretation, suggesting that OLS
yields consistent coefficient estimates but incorrect estimates of standard errors and significance levels. Because the coefficient estimates obtained from the spatial error model presented no major differences from the OLS estimates in terms of
magnitude, sign, and significance level, only the results of the spatial error models are presented here. The OLS results are
available from the authors upon request. In addition, several types of weights matrices were tested, yielding quite similar
results. The results presented in this article arise from the use of an inverse distance weights matrix. All spatial dependence
diagnostics and maximum likelihood regressions were carried out using SpaceStat (Anselin, 1992, 1995).
28. As described separately for each measure in the previous section, each independent variable was expected to have a
positive impact on the change in the index of average earnings except for the dummy variables.
29. Proprietors tend to report lower earnings than the average for nonproprietors, and this means that regions gaining in
the share of earnings to sole proprietors may report smaller increases in average earnings. Business service and manufacturing jobs report average wages that are larger than the overall average of the national economy. Thus, regions with increasing shares of business service and manufacturing jobs may record increases in average earnings due to labor occupation
composition.
30. Models run with an alternate dependent variable not adjusted with the CPI series yielded larger significance levels
for the coefficients of the census region variables but no major differences in the other coefficients.
31. Spatial dependence diagnostics were calculated independently for the first model and for the three partitions of the
second model, yielding mixed indications of preferability among OLS, spatial error correction, and spatial lag correction
regression techniques. All three types of regressions were then carried out for each of the three partitions. As with the first
model, there were only minor differences in coefficient estimates and significance levels. To maintain consistency, results
are presented for the spatial error correction regressions only; the results for the spatial lag and OLS regressions are available
from the authors upon request.
32. To the extent possible, the same independent variables were used for all of the partitioned regressions in order to
ensure comparability. All of the air hub dummies were dropped from the regression for small MSAs due to lack of variation
(only three of the small MSAs are classified as a hub of any size); similarly, the medium– and large–air hub dummies were
dropped from the regression for medium MSAs.
33. This conclusion may hold more weight in the short than the long run; the breadth of university activities may be one
factor allowing areas to escape regional lock-in to particular development paths and technological regimes (see Paytas,
Gradeck, & Andrews, 2004).
