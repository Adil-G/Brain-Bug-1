(12), we have
E(Rp) = (1-/p) * RF + 1p * E(Rm),
or
E(Rp) = RF +

Pp * (E(Rm) -

RF).

(13)

Equation (13) is the Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM), an extremely important theoretical
result. It says that the expected return on a portfolio should exceed the riskless rate of return by an
amount which is proportional to the portfolio beta.
That is, the relationship between return and risk
should be linear.
The model is often stated in "risk-premium"
form. Risk premiums are obtained by subtracting
the risk-free rate from the rates of return. The expected portfolio and market risk premiums
(designated E(rp) and E(rm)respectively) are given
by
(14a)

E(rp) = E(Rp) - RF,
E(rm) = E(RM)

-

(14b)

RF.

Substituting these risk premiums into Equation
(13), we obtain
E(rp) = 8 p * E(rm)

(15)

In this form, the CAPM states that the expected
risk premium for the investor's portfolio is equal to
its beta value times the expected market risk
premium.
We can illustrate the model by assuming that
short-term (risk-free) interest rate is 6 per cent and
the expected return on the market is 10 per cent.
The expected risk premium for holding the market
portfolio is just the difference between the 10 per
cent and the short-term interest rate of 6 per cent,
or 4 per cent. Investors who hold the market portfolio expect to earn 10 per cent, which is 4 per
cent greater than they could earn on a short.term
market instrument for certain. In order to satisfy
Equation (1 3), the expected return on securities or
portfolios with different levels of risk must be:
Expected Return for Different Levels of Portfolio Beta
Beta

Expected Return

0.0
0.5

6%
8%

1.0

10%

1.5

12%

14%

The predictions of the model are inherently sensible. For safe investments (/3 = 0), the model
predicts that investors would expect to earn the
risk-free rate of interest. For a risky investment (,8

> 0) investors would expect a rate of return proportional to the market sensitivity (,8) of the investment. Thus, stocks with lower than average
market sensitivities (such as most utilities) would
offer expected returns less than the expected
market return. Stocks with above average values of
beta (such as most airline securities) would offer
expected returns in excess of the market.
In our development of CAPM we have made a
number of assumptions that are required if the
model is to be established on a rigorous basis.
These assumptions involve investor behavior and
conditions in the capital markets. The following is
a set of assumptions that will allow a simple
derivation of the model.
(a) The market is composed of risk-averseinvestors
who measurerisk in termsof standarddeviationof
portfolio return.This assumptionprovidesa basis
for the use of beta-typerisk measures.
(b) All investorshave a commontime horizonfor investment decision making (e.g., one month, one
year,etc.). This assumptionallowsus to measureinvestor expectationsover some common interval,
thus makingcomparisonsmeaningful.
(c) All investors are assumedto have the same expectationsabout future securityreturnsand risks.
Withoutthis assumption,the analysiswouldbecome
much more complicated.
(d) Capital marketsare perfect in the sense that all
assets are completelydivisible,there are no transactions costs or differentialtaxes, and borrowing
and lendingrates are equal to each other and the
same for all investors.Without these conditions,
frictional barrierswould exist to the equilibrium
conditionson whichthe model is based.
While these assumptions are sufficient to derive
the model, it is not clear that all are necessary in
their current form. It may well be that several of
the assumptions can be substantially relaxed
without major change in the form of the model. A
good deal of research is currently being conducted
toward this end.
While the CAPM is indeed simple and elegant,
these qualities do not in themselves guarantee that
it will be useful in explaining observed risk-return
patterns. In Section 8 we will review the empirical
literature on attempts to verify the model.
7. Measurement of Security
and Portfolio Beta Values
The basic data for estimating betas are past rates of
return earned over a series of relatively short intervals-usually days, weeks, or months. For
example, in Tables 3 and 4 we present calculations

based on month-by-month rates of return for the
periods January 1945 to June 1970 (security betas)
and January 1960 to December 1971 (mutual fund
betas). The returns were calculated using Equation
(1 a).
It is customary to convert the observed rates of
return to risk premiums. Section 6 showed that risk
premiums are obtained by subtracting the rates of
return that could have been achieved by investing
in short-maturity risk-free assets, such as treasury
bills or prime commercial paper. This removes a
source of "noise" from the data. The noise stems
from the fact that observed returns may be higher
in some years simply because risk-free rates of interest are higher. Thus, an observed rate of return
of eight per cent might be regarded as satisfactory
if it occurred in 1960, but as a relatively low rate
of return when interest rates were at all-time highs

<-----Page 5-----><-----Page 6----->Exhibit 9 shows the plot of the monthly risk
premiums on the 100-stock portfolio against the
NYSE index for the same 1945-1970 period. As in
the case of National Department Stores, the bestfit line has been put through the points using
regression analysis. The slope of the line (A&)is
equal to 1.10, with a standard error of 0.03. Note
the substantial reduction in the standarderror term
compared to the security examples. The estimated
alpha is 0.14, with a standard error of 0.10. Again,
we cannot conclude that the true alpha is different
from zero. Note that the points group much closer
to the line than in the National Department Store
plot. This results, of course, from the fact that
much of the unsystematic risk causing the points to
be scattered around the regression line in Exhibit 8
has been elimated. The reduction is evidenced by
the R2 measure of 0.87 (versus 0.27 for National
Department Stores). Thus the market explains

more than three times as much of the return
variation of the portfolio than for the stock.
Table 5 gives regression results for a sample of
49 mutual funds. The calculations are based on
monthly risk premiums for the period January
1960 to December 1971. The market is represented by the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index.
Average values and standard deviations for the 49
funds in the sample are shown in the last two rows
of the table. The average beta value for the group
is 0.93-indicating, on the average, that the funds
were less risky than the market index. Note the
relatively low beta values of the balanced and bond
funds, in particular the Keystone B1, B2, and B4
bond funds. This result is due to the low systematic
risk of the bond portfolios.
Up to this point we have shown that it is a
relatively easy matter to estimate beta values for
stocks, portfolios, and mutual funds. Now, if the

<-----Page 7----->the 500 security betas from each 52-week period
(the historical betas) with the 52-week betas in the
following period (the future betas). Thus nine correlation studies were performedfor the ten periods.
To compare the stationarity of security and
portfolio betas, Levy constructed portfolios of 5,
10, 25, and 50 securities and repeated the same
correlation analysis for the historical portfolio
betas and future beta values for the same portfolios
in the subsequent period. The portfolios were constructed by ranking security betas in each period
and partitioning the list into portfolios containing
5, 10, 25 and 50 securities. Each portfolio contained an equal investment in each security.
The results of Levy's 52-week correlation studies
are presented in Table 5. The average values of the
correlation coefficients from the nine trials were
0.486, 0.769, 0.853, 0.939, and 0.972 for portfolios of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 stocks, respectively.

beta values are to be useful for investment decision
making, they must be predictable. Beta values
based on historical data should provide considerable information about future beta values if
past measures are to be useful. How predictable
are the betas estimated for stocks, portfolios of
stocks, and mutual funds? Fortunately, we have
empirical evidence at each level.
Robert A. Levy [ 13 ] * has conducted tests of the
short-run predictability (also referred to as
stationarity) of beta coefficients for securities and
unmanaged portfolios of securities. Levy's results
are based on weekly returns for 500 NYSE stocks
for the period December 30, 1960 through December 18, 1970 (520 weeks). Betas were developed
for each security for ten non-overlapping 52-week
periods. To measure stationarity, Levy correlated

<-----Page 8----->Correspondingly, the average percentages of the
variation in future betas explained by the historical
betas are 23.6, 59.1, 72.8, 88.2, and 94.5.
The results show the beta coefficients to be very
predictable for large portfolios and progressively
less predictable for smaller portfolios and individual securities. These conclusions are not affected by changes in market performance. Of the
nine correlation studies, five covered forecast
periods during which the market performance was
the reverse of the preceding period (61-62, 62-63,
65-66, 66-67, and 68-69). Notably, the betas were
approximately as predictable over these five reversal periods as over the remaining four intervals.5
The question of the stability of mutual fund beta
values is more complicated. Even if, as seen above,
the betas of large unmanaged portfolios are very
predictable, there is no a priori need for mutual
fund betas to be comparatively stable. Indeed, the
betas of mutual fund portfolios may change substantially over time by design. For example, a portfolio manager may tend to reduce the risk exposure
of his fund prior to an expected market decline and
raise it prior to an expected market upswing.
However, the range of possible values for beta will
tend to be restricted, at least in the longer run, by
the fund's investment objective. Thus while one
does not expect the same standardof predictability
as for large unmanaged portfolios, it may nevertheless be interesting to examine the extent to
which fund betas are predictable.
Pogue and Conway [21] have conducted tests
for a sample of 90 mutual funds. The beta values

for the period January 1969 through May 1970
were correlated with values from the subsequent
period from June 1970 through October 1971. To
test the sensitivity of the results to changes in the
return measurement interval, the betas for each
sub-period were measured for daily, weekly, and
monthly returns. The betas were thus based on
very different numbers of observations, namely
357, 74, and 17, respectively. The resulting
correlation coefficients were 0.915, 0.895, and
0.703 for daily, weekly, and monthly betas. Correspondingly, the average percentages of variation in
second-period betas explained by first-period
values are 84, 81, and 49, respectively. The results
support the contention that historical betas contain
useful information about future values. However,
the degree of predictability depends on the extent
to which measurement errors have been eliminated
from beta estimates. In the Pogue-Conway study,
the shift from monthly to daily returns reduced the
average standard error of the estimated beta values
from 0.11 to 0.03, a 75 per cent reduction. The
more accurate daily estimates resulted in a much
higher degree of beta predictability, the correlation
between sub-period betas increasing from 0.703 to
0.91 5,6
Exhibit 10 shows a Pogue-Conway plot of the
first-period versus second-period betas based on
daily returns. The figure illustrates the high degree
of correlation between first- and second-period
betas.
In summary, we can conclude that estimated individual security betas are not highly predictable.

Levy's tests indicated that an average of 24 per
cent of the variation in second-period betas is explained by historical values. The betas of his portfolios, on the other hand, were much more predictable, the degree of predictability increasing with
portfolio diversification. The results of the Pogue
and Conway study and others show that fund
betas, not unexpectedly, are not as stable as those
for unmanaged portfolios. Nonetheless, two-thirds
to three-quartersof the variation in fund betas can
be explained by historical values.
The reader should remember that a significant
portion of the measured changes in estimated beta
values may not be -due to changes in the true
values, but rather to measurementerrors. This observation is particularly applicable to individual
security betas where the standard errors tend to be
large.
8. Tests of The Capital Asset
Pricing Model *
The major difficulty in testing the CAPM is that
the model is stated in terms of investors' expectations and not in terms of realized returns.The
fact that expectations are not always realized introduces an error term, which from a statistical
point of view should be zero on the average, but
*The material in this section was also prepared as an appendix to testimony to be delivered before the Federal
Communications Commission by S.C. Myers and GA.
Pogue.

where Rj, RM, and RF are the average realized
returns on the stock, the market and the risk-free
rate. If the CAPM is correct, the average residual
term, Ej, should approach zero as the number of
periods used to compute the average becomes
large. To test this hypothesis, we can regress the
average returns, Rj, for a series of stocks (j= 1,
N) on the stocks' estimated beta values, /3G,during
the period studied. The equation of the fitted line
is given by
Rj=y0

+ y1j+/j,

(18a)

where yo and y1 are the intercept and slope of the
line, and i,j is the deviation of stock j from the
line. By comparing Equations (17b) and (18a), we
infer that if the CAPM hypothesis is valid, /L
Furshould equal Ej Jand hence should be small.
~~~~~~~A
thermore, it should be uncorrelated with 3,j,and
hence we can also infer that yv and y1 should
equal RF and RM - RF respectively.
The hypothesis is illustrated in Exhibit 11. Each
plotted point represents one stock's realized return
versus the stock's beta. The vertical distances of
the points from the CAPM theoretical line (also
called the "market line") represent the mean
residual returns, Ej. Assuming the CAPM to be
correct, the Ej should be uncorrelated with the fBj
and thus the regression equation fitted to these
points should be (1) linear, (2) upward sloping with
slope equal to RM - RF, and (3) should pass
through the vertical axis at the risk-free rate.
Expressed in risk-premiumform, the equation of
the fitted line is

<-----Page 10----->in risk-premium form [Equation (15)], the predicted values for y0 and yi are 0 and rm, the
mean market risk premium (RM - RF). Thus shifting to risk premiums changes the predicted value
only for yo, but not for y1.
Other Measures of Risk
The hypothesis just described is only true if beta
is a complete measure of a stock's risk. Various
alternative risk measures have been proposed,
however. The most common alternative hypothesis
states that expected return is related to the standard deviation of return-that is, to a stock's total
risk, which includes both systematic and unsystematic components.
Which is more important in explaining average
observed returns on securities, systematic or unsystematic risk? The way to find out is to fit an expanded equation to the data:
Rj=

yo + yl8j + y2(SEj) + pj.

<-----Page 11----->The results for the first test show a significant
positive relationship between mean return and
beta. A one-unit increase in beta is associated with
a 7.1 per cent increase in mean return.
The results for the second test do not agree with
the CAPM's predictions. That is, high unsystematic
risk is apparently associated with higher realized
returns. However, Miller and Scholes show that
this correlation may be largely spurious (i.e., it may
be due to statistical sampling problems). For exam-

ple, a substantial positive correlation exists between beta and (SEC)2. Thus unsystematic risk
will appear to be significant in tests from which
beta has been omitted, even though it may be
unimportant to the pricing of securities. This sort
of statistical correlation need not imply a causal
link between the variables.
Test number (3) includes both beta and (Sgj)2 in
the regression equation. Both are found to be
significantly positively related to mean return. The

<-----Page 12----->inclusion of (SEj)2 has somewhat weakened the
relationship of return and beta, however. A oneunit increase in beta is now associated with only a
4.2 per cent increase in mean return.
The interpretation of these results is again complicated by the strong positive correlation between
beta and (SEj)2,and by other sampling problems.8
A significant portion of the correlation between
mean return and (SEj)2 may well be a spurious
result. In any case, the results do show that stocks
with high systematic risk tend to have higher rates
of return.

By carefully grouping the securities into portfolios, much of this measurement error problem
can be eliminated. The errors in individual stocks'
betas cancel out so that the portfolio beta can be
measured with much greater precision. This in turn
means that tests based on portfolio returns will be
more efficient than tests based on security returns.
The second problem relates to the obscuring effect of residual variation. Realized security returns
have a large random component, which typically
accounts for about 70 per cent of the variation of
return. (This is the diversifiable or unsystematic
risk of the stock.) By grouping securities into portResults for Tests Based on Portfolio Returns

the test period were divided into 10 portfolios. The
securities were assigned on the basis of their betas
during the preceding four years-the 10 per cent
of securities with the lowest betas to the first portfolio, the group with the next lowest betas to the
second portfolio, and so on.
After the start of the test periods, the securities
were reassigned annually. That is, each stock's
estimated beta was recomputed at the end of each
successive year, the stocks were ranked again on
the basis of their betas, and new portfolios were
formed. This procedure kept the portfolio betas
reasonably stable over time.
The performance of these portfolios is summarized in Table 8. The table gives the arithmetic
mean monthly returns and average beta values for
each of the 10 portfolios and for each test period.
For the 1929-69 period, the results indicate a
strong positive association between return and
beta. For the 1948-69 period, while higher beta
portfolios had higher returns than portfolios with
lower betas, there was little difference in return
among portfolios with betas greater than 1.0. The
1956-69 period results do not show a clear relationship between beta and return. On the basis of
these and other tests, the authors conclude that
NYSE stocks with above average risk have higher
returnsthan those with below average risk, but that
there is little payoff for assuming additional risk
within the group of stocks with above average
betas.
In their second study [3], Blume and Friend
used monthly portfolio returns during the 1955-68
period to test the CAPM. Their tests involved fitting the coefficients of Equation (1 8a) for three

sequential periods: 1955-59, 1960-64, and 196568. The authors also added a factor to the
regression equation to test for the linearity of the
risk-return relationship.9
The values obtained for y0 and y1 are not in
line with the Capital Asset Pricing Model's predictions, however. In the first two periods, y0 is substantially larger than the theoretical value. In the
third period, the reverse situation exists, with y0
substantially less than predicted. These results imply that y1, the slope of the fitted line, is less than
predicted in the first two periods and greater in the
third.'0 Friend and Blume conclude that "the comparisons as a whole suggest that a linear model is a
tenable approximation of the empirical relationship between return and risk for NYSE stocks over
the three periods covered.""
Black, Jensen, and Scholes. This study [1] is a
careful attempt to reduce measurement errors that
would bias the regression results. For each year
from 1931 to 1965, the authors grouped all NYSE
stocks into 10 portfolios. The number of securities
in each portfolio increased over the 35-year period
from a low of 58 securities per portfolio in 1931 to
a high of 110 in 1965.
Month-by-month returns for the portfolios were
computed from January 1931 to December 1965.
Average portfolio returns and portfolio betas were
computed for the 35-year period and for a variety
of sub-periods. The results for the complete period
are shown in Table 9. The average monthly portfolio returns and beta values for the 10 portfolios
are plotted in Exhibit 12. The results indicate that
over the complete 35-year period, average return
increased by approximately 1.08 per cent per
month (13 per cent per year) for a one-unit in-

amount predicted by the CAPM. As Exhibit 12
shows, there appears to be little reason to question
the linearity of the relationship over the 35-year
period.
Black, Jensen, and Scholes also estimated the
risk-return tradeoff for a number of subperiods.12
The slopes of the regression lines tend in most
periods to understatethe theoretical values, but are
generally of the correct sign. Also, the subperiod
relationships appear to be linear.
This paper provides substantial support for the
hypothesis that realized returns are a linear function of systematic risk values. Moreover, it shows
that the relationship is significantly positive over
long periods of time.
Fama and MacBeth. Fama and MacBeth [6] have
extended the Black-Jensen-Scholes tests to include
two additional factors. The first is an average of
the /j2 for all individual securities in portfolio p,
designated 83p2.The second is a similar average of
the residual standard deviations (Sfj) for all stocks
in portfolio p, designated SP-. The first term tests
for nonlinearities in the risk-return relationship,
the second for the impact of residual variation.

where, according to the CAPM, we should expect
Y2 and y3 to have zero values.
The results of the Fama-MacBeth tests show that
while estimated values of y2 and Y3 are not equal
to zero for each interval examined, their average
values tend to be insignificantly different from
zero. Fama and MacBeth also confirm the BlackJensen-Scholes result that the realized values of yo
are not equal to Rf, as predicted by the CAPM.
Summary of Test Results
We will briefly summarize the major results of
the empirical tests.
1. The evidence shows a significant positive relationship
between realized returns and systematic risk.
However, the slope of the relationship (y1) is usually
less than predicted by the CAPM.
2. The relationship between risk and return appears to
be linear. The studies give no evidence of significant
curvature in the risk-return relationship.
3. Tests that attempt to discriminate between the effects
of systematic and unsystematic risk do not yield
definitive results. Both kinds of risk appear to be
positively related to security returns. However, there

is substantial support for the proposition that the relationship between return and unsystematic risk is at
least partly spurious-that is, it partly reflects
statistical problems rather than the true nature of
capital markets.

Obviously, we cannot claim that the CAPM is
absolutely right. On the other hand, the empirical
tests do support the view that beta is a useful risk
measure and that high beta stocks tend to be priced
so as to yield correspondingly high rates of return.
9. Measurement of Investment Performance
The basic concept underlying investment performance measurement follows directly from the riskreturn theory. The return on managed portfolios,
such as mutual funds, can be judged relative to the

<-----Page 15----->returns on unmanaged portfolios at the same
degree of investment risk. If the return exceeds the
standard, the portfolio managerhas performed in a
superior way, and vice versa. Given this, it remains
to select a set of "benchmark" portfolios against
which the performance of managed portfolios can
be evaluated.
Performance Measures Developed
from the Capital Asset Pricing Model
The CAPM provides a convenient and familiar
standard for performance measurement;the benchmark portfolios are simply combinations of the
riskless asset and the market index. The return
standard for a mutual fund, for example, with beta
equal to ,Qp,is equal to the risk-free rate (RF) plus
,8p times the average realized risk premium on the

market (RM - RF). Thus the return on the per-

formance standard (Rs) is given by
RS = RF + /p (RM-RF),

The MarketLine

where RM and RF are the arithmetic average
returns on the market index and riskless asset
during the evaluation period. The performance
measure, designated arp, is equal to the difference
in average returns between the fund and its standard; that is,
ap=

RP-RS,

(22)

where Rp is the arithmetic average return on the
fund. Under the CAPM assumption, the expected
values of RP and RS are the same; therefore the expected value for the performance measure a'p is
zero. Managed portfolios with positive estimated
values for ap have thus outperformedthe standard,
and vice versa. Estimated values of alpha (ap) are
determined by regressing the portfolio risk
premiums on the corresponding market risk
premiums.

The interpretation of the estimated alpha must
take into consideration possible statistical
measurement errors. As we discussed in Section 7,
the standard error of alpha (SE,) is an indication
of the extent of the possible measurement error.
The larger the standard error, the less certain we
can be that measured alpha is a close approximation of the true value.13
A measure of the degree of statistical
significance of the estimated alpha value is given
by the ratio of the estimated alpha to its standard
error. The ratio, designated as ta, is given by
ta = ap / SEa.

The statistic ta gives a measure of the extent to
which the true value of alpha can be considered to
be different from zero. If the absolute value of ta is
large, then we have more confidence that the true
value of alpha is different from zero. Absolute
values of ta in excess of 2.0 indicate a probability
of less than about 2.5 per cent that the true value
of alpha is zero.
These methods of performance measurement
were originally devised by Michael Jensen [10, 1]
and have been widely used in many studies of investment performance, including that of the recent
SEC Institutional Investor Study [21].
A performance measure closely related to the
Jensen alpha measure was developed by Jack L.
Treynor [24]. The Treynor performance measure
(designated TI)'4 is given by
TI

=

a//.

(24)

The difference between the a and TI performance
measures is simply that the fund alpha value has
FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL / MAY-JUNE 1974 O

83

<-----Page 16----->been divided by its estimated beta. The effect,
however, is significant, eliminating a so-called
"leverage bias" from the Jensen alpha measures.
This is illustrated in Exhibit 13.
Funds A and B in Exhibit 13 have the same
alpha values. (The alphas are equal to the vertical
distance on the diagram between the funds and the
market line.) By combining portfolio B with the
riskless rate (that is, by borrowing or lending at
RF), any return-risk combination along line Y can
be obtained. But such points are clearly dominated
by combinations along line X-attainable
by
borrowing or lending combined with fund A. As
Exhibit 13 shows, the alpha for fund A, when
levered to the same beta as fund B (Point A'),
dominates the latter's alpha value.
The Treynor measure eliminates this leverage effect. All funds which lie along a line (such as X or
Y) have the same TI value; therefore borrowing or
lending combined with any fund outcome will not
increase (or decrease) its performance measure.
The Treynor measure thus permits direct performance comparisons among funds with differing beta
values.
Problems with the Market Line Standard
The tests of the CAPM summarized in Section 8
indicate that the average returns over time on
securities and portfolios tend to deviate from the
predictions of the model. Though the observed
risk-returnrelationships seem to be linear, they are
generally flatter than predicted by the CAPM, implying that the tradeoff of risk for return is less
than predicted.
This evidence raises some question as to whether
the CAPM market line provides the best benchmark for performance measurement and suggests
instead that other benchmark portfolios may be
more appropriate. For example, under certain conditions, the "empirical"risk-returnlines developed
by Black, Jensen, and Scholes [1 ] and others
would seem to be a reasonable alternative to the
CAPM market line standard. This might be the
case if the portfolio for which performance is being
measured were restricted to exactly the same set of
investment options used to create the empirical
standard,that is, if the portfolio were fully invested
in common stock and could not use leverage to increase its beta value. For such a portfolio it would
seem appropriate to measure performance relative
to the empirical line, as opposed to the market
line.
A comparison of these standards is illustrated in

Exhibit 14. The market line performance measure
(designated as a, in Exhibit 14) is equal to the vertical distance from the portfolio to the market line.
The empirical line measure (designated a2) is the

vertical distance from the portfolio to the empirical
line. Since ideally all the stocks used to develop the
empirical line are contained in the market index,
the empirical line, like the market line, would be
expected to have a return equal to market return,
RM, for beta equal to 1.0. The intercepts on the
return axis, however, are typically different for the
two lines. The market line intercept, by definition,
is equal to the average risk-free rate. The empirical
line intersects the return axis at a point different
from RF, and typically above it. This intercept
equals the average return on a portfolio with "zero
beta", designated Rz. The existence of a long-run
average return on the zero beta portfolio that differs from the riskless rate is a clear violation of the
predictions of the CAPM. As of this time, there is
no clear theoretical understandingof the reason for
this difference.
To summarize, empirically based performance

<-----Page 17----->standards could, under certain conditions, provide
alternatives to those of the CAPM market line
standard. However, the design of appropriate empirical standards requires further research. In the
interim, the familiar market line benchmarks can
provide useful information regarding performance,
although the information should not be regardedas
being very precise.15 .
Footnotes
1. From this point on, systematicrisk will be referredto simply
as "risk." Total risk will be referred to as "total risk."
2. We use the term portfolio in a general sense, including the
case where the investor holds only one security. Since portfolio return and (systematic) risk are simply weighted
averages of security values, risk-returnrelationships which
hold for securities must also be true for portfolios, and vice
versa.
3. The sample was picked to give the broadest possible range
of security beta values. This was accomplished by ranking
all NYSE securities with complete data from 1945-70 by
their estimated beta values during this period. We then
selected every 25th stock from the ordered list. The data
was obtained from the Universityof Chicago CRSP (Center
for Research in Security Prices) tape.
4. The commercial paper results in Table 3 are rates of return,
not risk premiums.The risk premiumswould equal zero by
definition.
5. Correlation studies of this type tend to produce a conservative picture of the degree of beta coefficient
stationarity.This results from the fact that it is not possible
to correlate the true beta values but only estimates which
contain varying degrees of measurement error.
Measurementerror would reduce the correlation coefficient
even though the underlying beta values were unchanged
from period to period.
6. These results are consistent with those found by N. Mains in
a later study [16]. Mains correlated adjacent calendar-year
betas for a sample of 99 funds for the period 1960 through
1971. The betas were based on weekly returns.The average
correlation coefficient for 11 tests was 0.788, with individual values ranging from a low of 0.614 to a high of
0.871.
7. SEj is an estimate of the standarderror of the residual term
in Equation (17a). Thus it is the estimated value for o(e),
the unsystematic risk term defined in Equation (8). See
column (6) of Tables 3 and 4 for typical values for
securities and mutual funds.
8. For example, skewness in the distributionsof stock returns
can lead to spurious correlations between mean return and
SEj. See Miller and Scholes [19], pp. 66-71.

14. Treynor's work preceded that of Jensen. In a discussion of
Jensen's performance measure [26], Treynor showed that
his measure (as originally presented in [25 ]) was equivalent
to
TI = RF - a/13.
Since RF is a constant, the TI index for rankingpurposes is
equivalent to that given in Equation (24).

decision they draw from their knowledge are valid,
but also because of the effect of their knowledge
and thought on the price behavior of securities.
The unconventional analyst will be as fully aware
as he can of what Street analysts know and think.
Approaching Street opinion with humility, he will
respect and seriously reckon with it.
But he must do so from a higher standpoint-like the player-manager of a football or
baseball team. He will play the game like the
others, but at the same time be above it, so that he
can best see and understand how the various plays
assemble into a winning strategyor why they fail so
to assemble. He must have the penetration to
foresee tendencies towards criticality in the conditions currently favoring a company (as a team);
the courage to question the assumptions about a
company and its environment that others take for
granted, or about investment strategies with which
other players are comfortable; above all, the
imagination to shift perspectives, to see situations
from points of view to which others are unaccustomed, that they may be unable even to conceive. He would be critical also of the critical
opinions he himself holds, incessantly seeking
refutation rather than confirmation, of his
opinions, so that periodically corrected, perhaps
drastically revised, they may be more and more
sensitively attuned to changing situations. He
would thus be able to annul errors before their
consequences can no longer be mitigated at acceptable cost.
Like the player-manager of a team, a moneymanager'sprimary role is that of manager, not that
of investor. That should be the basis of his
motivation as well as his thinking. He should seek
his rewards from effectively performing as a
manager rather than from playing the market for
his own account. (It may be best that he not play
the market at all, just as it is usually best for a team
that its manager not also be one of the players.)

If use of inside information is discouraged, and
if economic analysis can have no value for the investor, he is unlikely to achieve superior performance by relying on conventional approaches.
Rather, superior performance requires the special
intellectual temper and approaches to investment
opportunities suggested in this article. a
