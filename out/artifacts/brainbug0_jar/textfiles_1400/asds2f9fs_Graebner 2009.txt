CAVEAT VENDITOR: TRUST ASYMMETRIES IN
ACQUISITIONS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS
MELISSA E. GRAEBNER
University of Texas at Austin
I explore the role of trust in acquisitions of entrepreneurial firms, taking a dyadic view
that gives equal attention to buyers and sellers. The two parties have asymmetric views
regarding whether their counterparts are trustworthy. I outline how these asymmetries
emerge, persist, and influence behavior, including tendencies to behave deceptively
and to guard against deception. I also find that buyers’ and sellers’ beliefs concerning
whether their counterparts are trustworthy and trusting are often erroneous. I explore
the implications of these findings for developing a theory of trust asymmetries and
argue that selecting buyers on the basis of trust increases rather than diminishes
entrepreneurs’ vulnerability.

Interorganizational trust is a subject of substantial interest to organizational and management
scholars. Previous research has focused primarily
on trust in the context of long-term alliances, particularly long-lasting relationships between buyers
and suppliers (e.g., Dyer & Chu, 2000; Sako &
Helper, 1998; Saparito, Chen, & Sapienza, 2004).
Scholars have examined how trust develops between alliance partners (e.g., Doz, 1996; Ring & Van
de Ven, 1994), influences subsequent partner selection (Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999), and shapes outcomes such as governance structures (Gulati &
Singh, 1998), information sharing (Larson, 1992;
Uzzi, 1996), satisfaction with partnerships (Anderson & Narus, 1990; Mohr & Spekman, 1994), and
financial performance (Luo, 2002).
Interfirm trust has received much less attention
in the context of an equally significant set of interorganizational transactions, mergers and acquisitions
(M&A). Acquisitions are important strategic tools
that enable companies to obtain valuable technology (Puranam, Singh, & Zollo, 2006), spur innovation (Ahuja & Katila, 2001; Paruchuri, Nerkar, &
Hambrick, 2006), penetrate international markets
(Birkinshaw, Bresman, & Hakanson, 2000; Vermeulen & Barkema, 2001), and reconfigure firm
resources (Capron, Dussauge, & Mitchell, 1998).
Yet, despite the importance of these transactions,
mergers and acquisitions have received little attention in the organizational trust literature (Stahl &
Sitkin, 2005).
Similarly, trust has received little attention in the
large literature on mergers and acquisitions. The

M&A literature provides some hints that trust plays
a role in mergers and acquisitions, but ultimately
these hints raise more questions than they answer.
Case study data suggest that acquisition targets favor acquirers they trust (Graebner & Eisenhardt,
2004), and larger-scale studies indicate that acquisition deals are more likely to occur when a buyer
and seller have a prior direct relationship (Schildt
& Laamanen, 2006; Vanhaverbeke, Duysters, &
Noorderhaven, 2002) or shared network ties
(D’Aveni & Kesner, 1993), circumstances that may
foster trust (Gulati, 1995; Larson, 1992; Uzzi, 1997).
Yet despite these signs that trust may be present
between buyers and sellers, authors have described
deception by buyers as “standard practice” (Buono
& Bowditch, 1989: 256) and noted that distrust
often emerges after deals close (Buono, Bowditch, &
Lewis, 1985; Haspeslagh & Jemison, 1991), when
buyers’ “prior promises mean nothing” (Marks &
Mirvis, 2001: 87).
The apparent coexistence of trust and deception
in acquisitions is puzzling. On the one hand, if
buyer deception is common, it is not surprising that
sellers would prefer buyers they trust. But if sellers
favor buyers they trust, how can deception by buyers remain so common? If buyers and sellers often
have prior direct relationships or shared thirdparty ties, why are sellers so often mistaken in their
assessments of buyers? Moreover, knowing they are
trusted by sellers, why do buyers not feel the sense
of moral obligation to behave in good faith that
has been observed in alliances (Larson, 1992)? Why
aren’t buyers more concerned with the negative
implications of deception for postdeal cooperation
by acquired employees, or for their firms’
reputations?

These questions are especially perplexing for acquisitions of knowledge-based, technology-intensive firms, an important source of innovation and
growth in high-technology industries (Ahuja &
Katila, 2001; Puranam et al., 2006). In knowledgeintensive markets, firm leaders have more discretion to choose their acquirers (Coff, 2003), suggesting acquisition targets may be particularly able to
select buyers they trust. Technology-intensive industries are often tightly networked (Castilla,
Hwang, Granovetter, & Granovetter, 2000; Powell,
1990), implying that sellers should have easy access to information about buyers. Moreover, the
success of a technology-based acquisition depends
on the continued presence and cooperation of acquired employees (Granstrand & Sjolander, 1990;
Ranft & Lord, 2002), raising the potential costs to
buyers of behaving deceptively. These factors
should make the coexistence of trust and deception
even less likely.
In the current work, I seek to unravel these puzzles. The purpose of this study is to explore trust
and deception in acquisitions of technology ventures, giving equal attention to the views of buyers
and sellers. In examining these issues, I aim to
address calls for more context-specific examinations of trust (Kramer, 1999; Krishnan, Martin, &
Noorderhaven, 2006; Schoorman, Mayer, & Davis,
2007). I find that trust and deception can coexist in
the context of acquisitions because of a complex set
of asymmetries and errors in both parties’ views
regarding trust and trustworthiness. I examine how
these patterns both emerge from and influence acquisition events and behavior. A central theoretical
contribution of this research is a greater understanding of trust asymmetries, a topic that has been
identified as a “pressing unanswered question” in
trust theory (Gulati & Sytch, 2008: 277). Prior interorganizational trust research rests on an implicit assumption that trust between partners is symmetric,
yet it “has not examined the empirical validity of
this assumption nor the antecedents and the outcomes of asymmetric trust in interorganizational
relationships” (Zaheer & Harris, 2005: 193). The
current study begins to address these gaps by describing how trust asymmetries emerge, persist,
and influence decision making and behavior in the
strategically important setting of mergers and acquisitions. In addition, this study helps to develop
a dyadic perspective on acquisitions by giving
equal attention to the viewpoints and actions of
selling firms (Graebner, 2004; Graebner & Eisenhardt, 2004), a group largely neglected by prior
research.

METHODS
This study grew out of a broader research endeavor examining acquisition processes and decision making from the viewpoints of both buyers
and sellers. Trust was not a concept that was identified a priori as being of interest but one that
emerged from the data as an important influence on
acquisition decision making. A subsequent review
of the interorganizational trust literature revealed
very little previous work on trust in acquisitions,
suggesting the need to extend theory in this area.
The general approach of this study is “theory
elaboration” (Lee, Mitchell, & Sablynski, 1999).
Drawing upon prior research, I define trust as a
positive expectation regarding the conduct of another party in a situation involving risk or vulnerability (Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998; Zaheer,
McEvily, & Perrone, 1998). I adopt the perspective
that trust is a multilevel concept (Currall & Inkpen,
2002) and define interorganizational trust as the
“collectively-held orientation” of a group’s individual members toward another group or firm (Zaheer
et al., 1998: 143). By this definition, groups and
organizations as well as individuals can both trust
and be trusted. Trust at the top management team
level may be particularly critical in interorganizational transactions, since senior management is responsible for major strategic actions such as alliances and acquisitions (Schoorman et al., 2007;
Zaheer, Lofstrom, & George, 2002). Therefore, in
this study, I focus specifically on trust between the
top management teams of the buyer and seller engaged in an acquisition (or, if the buyer is a very
large firm, the top management team of the relevant
business unit).
The research design is a qualitative, multiplecase study (Eisenhardt, 1989). Case studies are a
preferred research strategy for examining complex
social phenomena because they allow researchers
to develop a holistic understanding of real-life
events (Yin, 2003) and to elucidate dynamic processes involving multiple causal chains (Pettigrew,
1992). In comparison to single-case, ethnographic
studies, the multiple-case method trades off a degree of detail in favor of greater generalizability
(Yin, 2003).

Setting
The research setting was acquisitions of entrepreneurial, technology-based ventures. This setting offered several advantages. As stated previously, acquisitions of technology ventures have particular
relevance for developing theory on trust in acqui-

<-----Page 2----->2009

sitions. Trust may be especially pertinent in these
transactions because technology-intensive firms
are more able to choose their own buyers (Coff,
2003) and have access to dense industry networks
that may supply useful information about potential
partners (Powell, 1990). In addition, privately held
targets represent the majority of acquisition activity
in the United States (Capron & Shen, 2007), and
acquisitions of entrepreneurial firms are the subject
of substantial and growing research interest (e.g.,
Puranam et al., 2006; Schweizer, 2005).
The current study focuses on the acquisition
wave of 1999 –2000. Most merger and acquisition
activity occurs in waves (e.g., Andrade & Stafford,
2004; Rhodes-Kropf & Viswanathan, 2004). These
waves are often triggered by technological advancement or other industry shocks (Harford, 2005),
coincide with peak market valuations, and are
followed by market declines (Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson, & Viswanathan, 2005). Following this pattern, the 1999 –2000 acquisition wave was triggered
by a significant technological advance (the growth
of the Internet) and coincided with a “boom-bust”
cycle in the financial markets.
Sample
The primary sample included 12 entrepreneurial
firms and eight acquirers. Table 1 summarizes various characteristics of the firms in this sample.
Three entrepreneurial firms were sampled in each
of four industries: networking hardware, communications software, financial software, and online
commerce. The sampled industries differed on key
strategic dimensions such as cost structure, customer profile, and method of sales and distribution.
In each industry, two of the entrepreneurial firms
were acquired (for a total of eight acquisitions), and
the remaining firm received interest from buyers
but remained independent. The eight completed
acquisitions provided a dyadic view of the entire
acquisition process. However, to understand if
trust influences whether an acquisition occurs at
all, it was also useful to examine deals that were
considered but never realized. I therefore gathered
data on deals that any of the eight buyers and 12
potential targets considered but did not complete.
Entrepreneurial activity is spatially concentrated
(Schoonhoven & Romanelli, 2001; Sorenson & Stuart, 2001). Since regional clustering could influence the dynamics of trust in acquisitions, I sampled both target-acquirer pairs that were located in
the same region and pairs that were located in
regions distant from one another (e.g., a European
firm acquiring a Silicon Valley start-up). The completed acquisitions included four target-acquirer

Graebner

437

pairs located in the same local region and four pairs
located in distant regions. All acquisitions took
place less than six months prior to data collection,
improving the likelihood that informants accurately remembered events that had occurred (Huber
& Power, 1985). Six acquisitions were ongoing during data collection. This allowed incorporation of
both real-time and retrospective data, a useful combination for understanding the sequence and flow
of events (Pettigrew, 1992). Retrospective data allow for efficiency in data collection, and real-time
data improve depth of understanding of how events
evolve over time (Leonard-Barton, 1990).
The mean acquisition price in the sample was
$175 million, which is very similar to the average
acquisition price of $155 million for U.S. venturefunded companies in the study time period, according to the database VentureSource. All acquisitions involved the purchase of 100 percent of the
targets’ equity. The sampled acquisitions were paid
for with the buyers’ equity, as was typical during
the study time period (Schultz & Zaman, 2001) and
is typical during merger waves in general (RhodesKropf & Viswanathan, 2004).
Agency theory suggests that the acquisition
motives and preferences of a target firm’s managers and its shareholders may differ (Jensen &
Meckling, 1976). I therefore collected information about the ownership structure of the target
firms. Of the eight companies that were acquired,
management owned a controlling share in four,
and investors owned a controlling share in four.
Five acquired firms had received venture capital,
and the remaining three were funded through
other sources, such as self-financing and angel
investment. I also collected information on acquired firm board composition. The mean number of directors was 5.1; 32 percent of the directors were active company managers; 44 percent,
investors; and 24 percent, outsiders. This breakdown was similar to the board composition reported in other studies of entrepreneurial firms
(Kaplan & Stromberg, 2003; Lerner, 1995).1
The buyers in the sample were more diverse and
included both young entrepreneurial firms and established multinational corporations. There were
six publicly traded and two privately held buyers.
The average number of employees among buyers

Lerner (1995) reported an average of 5.0 directors in
his sample (including 27 percent active managers, 46
percent investors, and 25 percent outsiders), and Kaplan
and Stromberg (2003) reported an average of 6.0 directors
(35 percent active managers, 41 percent investors, 23
percent outsiders).

was 8,500, with a range of 150 to 50,000. Because
some research has suggested that prior acquisitions may create routines that shape buyers’ behavior in subsequent deals (Zollo & Singh, 2004),
I collected data on buyers’ acquisition experience. I gathered information on whether a firm as
a whole had conducted prior acquisitions, as well
as whether individual members of the firm’s top
management team or board of directors had acquisition experience. Three of the eight buyers
had acquisition experience at the firm level and
had developed dedicated M&A staff. Of the remaining five buyers, three had acquisition experience among both the top management team and
the board of directors. The remaining two buyers
had acquisition experience within the board of
directors only. For completeness, I gathered the
same experience information for sellers. Although no seller had acquisition experience at
the firm level, 10 of the 12 sellers had acquisition
experience within their top management team,
board of directors, or both.

Data Collection
I used several data sources: (1) quantitative and
qualitative data from semistructured interviews
with key acquisition participants from both selling
and buying firms, (2) e-mails and phone calls to
clarify interviews and track real-time processes,
and (3) archival data, including company websites,
business publications, and regulatory filings. I conducted more than 80 interviews. The first phase
included 15 pilot interviews with managers who
had sold their companies, managers who had purchased companies, investors in companies that
were sold, and acquisition intermediaries. The pilot interviews indicated that sellers’ acquisition decisions were usually made by a small set of people,
typically the chief executive officer and two or
three key executives and/or board members. Buyers’ decision processes involved somewhat broader
participation, but decisions were ultimately made
by the top management team of the firm or, if the
buyer was very large, the top management team of

<-----Page 5----->440

Academy of Management Journal

the relevant business unit. Other individuals at
both firms had limited awareness of the events
taking place until late in the acquisition process.
In the primary data collection, I interviewed multiple senior-level informants from each firm. (See
Table 1 for a list of the positions of these interviewees.) Use of multiple informants mitigates subject
biases (Golden, 1992; Miller, Cardinal, & Glick,
1997) and leads to a richer, more elaborated model
(Schwenk, 1985). The pilot interviews guided my
identification of the informants who were the most
influential in each acquisition process. To further
ensure that the sample included the most important individuals, I used snowball sampling. My initial entry was typically made through either the
CEO of the selling firm or the head of business
development at the buying firm. Each informant then
named other individuals who had been actively involved in the acquisition within both the buyer and
seller. Selling firm informants typically included the
CEO and senior vice presidents (VPs), as well as one
or more investors who were board members and/or
had led a funding round. Buying firm informants
typically included the CEO or business unit head, the
vice president of business development, and one or
more other senior managers or board members who
were involved with the acquisition.
The interviews were 60 to 90 minutes in length.
Interviews began with background information and
then asked the informant for an open-ended chronology of the company’s acquisition-related activities and decisions. Open-ended questioning leads
to higher accuracy in retrospective reports (Lipton,
1977; Miller et al., 1997). Examples of questions
include, “When did you first begin thinking about
acquisition?” “What alternatives to acquisition did
you consider?” “What potential buyers/targets did
you consider, and what kind of interaction did you
have with them?” “Could you describe the negotiation process?” and “What happened after the acquisition closed?” No questions specifically mentioned trust, deception, or related issues. However,
these topics emerged unprompted in informants’
discussions of the pros and cons of various potential partners and their descriptions of negotiation
processes. Each interview concluded with several
closed-ended questions about the firm, including
its founding date and number of employees. In
addition to the buyers and sellers, I interviewed
several individuals who had extensive acquisition
experience, such as the head of technology mergers
at a prominent investment bank. These interviews
included questions that were idiosyncratic to the
expertise of the informant.
All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed.
The transcriptions totaled 1,260 double-spaced

June

pages. I asked follow-up questions via phone or
e-mail when clarification was required. If acquisition events were ongoing, I conducted subsequent
interviews when a major event occurred, such as
closure of the deal or the departure of an acquired
executive. This procedure allowed me to capture
events and viewpoints as they emerged. I interviewed informants as many as three times.
Throughout data collection, I took steps to minimize informant biases. First, as noted above, the
sample comprised cases in which the events of
interest had occurred no more than six months
prior to data collection. Prior research has suggested that informant recollections are stable over
periods of this length (Huber, 1985). Second, the
sample included real-time as well as retrospective
cases. During the analysis phase, I compared the
real-time and retrospective cases and confirmed
that no differences were present. Third, the informants included multiple individuals from each
selling and buying firm. Such individuals are likely
to have different perspectives on and interests in
the acquisition process. If retrospective (or other)
bias were an issue, I would have seen significant
differences in their event descriptions (Seidler,
1974). I did not. Fourth, I took care to interview
individuals at the center of the acquisition process.
Highly influential and knowledgeable informants
are the most reliable, particularly when they are
recalling important, recent events (Huber & Power,
1985; Kumar, Stern, & Anderson, 1993; Seidler,
1974). Fifth, I promised confidentiality to encourage candor (Glick, Huber, Miller, Doty, & Sutcliffe,
1990; Huber & Power, 1985; Miller et al., 1997).
Finally, I addressed potential subject bias by employing multiple data sources (Jick, 1979). I compared informants’ responses not only with those of
other informants, but also with archival data (from
sources such as acquisition announcements and
regulatory filings) where appropriate.
Data Analysis
Data analysis was partly planned and partly
emergent. Throughout the analysis, I shifted back
and forth between the raw data, the patterns emerging from the data, and extant theory on trust in
interorganizational transactions. The analysis took
an iterative rather than a linear path but for simplicity is presented here in distinct stages.
Stage 1. Because the purpose of this study was to
examine the role of trust throughout the acquisition
process, a first analytical step was to understand
and organize key acquisition events. I began by
writing detailed case studies (Eisenhardt, 1989).
The case studies were 40 to 70 pages in length and

<-----Page 6----->2009

included informant quotes as well as tables and
timelines summarizing the key facts of each acquisition. A second researcher also examined the raw
data and formed an independent perspective,
which was incorporated into each case.
I used a temporal bracketing strategy to distill a
process model from the cases (Denis, Lamothe, &
Langley, 2001; Langley, 1999). This strategy involves identifying discrete time periods, or phases,
within a process. In this study, phases were demarcated by changes in the individuals involved, the
nature of the activities taking place, and the physical location of these activities. Five acquisition
phases emerged from this analysis. The first phase
is screening, in which CEOs and business development officers initially evaluate both potential partners and potential partnership structures (i.e., acquisition versus alliance). The second phase is
socializing, in which the CEOs or business unit
heads of the two firms informally interact in nonwork settings. The third phase, which may overlap
with socializing, is agreeing in principle. In this
phase, the top managers’ discussions shift from
personal topics to drafting the outlines of the acquisition agreement. The fourth phase is legalization, in which managers work with attorneys and
financial advisors to create formal, legally binding
acquisition documents. This phase concluded with
the official closing of a deal. The last phase is
implementation, in which managers from the two
firms begin integrating the businesses.
Stage 2. The second stage of analysis was aimed
at understanding how informants described and
conceptualized trust in the context of acquisitions.
Prior research has used many different dimensionalizations and measures of trust (e.g., Cummings &
Bromiley, 1996; Currall & Judge, 1995; Mayer,
Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Because none of these
measures has emerged as dominant (McEvily &
Tortoriello, 2007), and because many were
uniquely tailored to their original settings, I initially cast a broad net. I examined each interview
transcript in detail, using existing interorganizational trust research in a “sensitizing” role (Miles &
Huberman, 1984; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). The trust
literature drew my attention to comments regarding
trust, vulnerability, integrity, deception, commitment fulfillment, reliability, and other related concepts. In this process, I discovered a correspondence
between informants’ comments and the trust dimensions developed and validated by Cummings and
Bromiley, who described trust as “an individual’s
belief or common belief among a group of individuals
that another individual or group (a) makes good-faith
efforts to behave in accordance with any commitments both explicit and implicit, (b) is honest in

Graebner

441

whatever negotiations preceded such commitments,
and (c) does not take excessive advantage of another
even when the opportunity is available” (1996: 303).
In the present context, evidence of trust on Cummings and Bromiley’s (1996) “a,” “b,” and “c” dimensions (described above) included the following
examples: (a) “We totally trusted them. We liked
how they did business—they do what they say they
are going to do”; (b) “When we got into the details
of the deal [during negotiations] . . . [the CFO] . . .
was just unbelievable to us. He was a straight shot”;
and (c) “You can trust them. . . . If we thought [buyer’s management] were out to get us and wanted to
drive us to the bone and sweat us out and were out
to screw us over, I wouldn’t have done the deal.”
Evidence of distrust on these dimensions included
comments such as: (a) “There’s never a sure thing.
[The deal] is not done until it’s signed and delivered,” (b) “During the courtship, everyone puts
their best foot forward. Then you find out later,”
and (c) “You get the feeling that they are going to
take you for a ride, chip away at your value—and
that leaves you exposed.” As in Cummings and
Bromiley (1996), the three dimensions were closely
related; in no case did leaders from a firm express
trust toward a given counterpart on one dimension
and distrust toward the same counterpart on any
other dimension.
Stage 3. In the final stage of analysis, I integrated
the findings from the preceding stages to understand how the presence or absence of trust influenced the unfolding of the acquisition process, and
vice versa. The process model developed in stage 1
served as an analytical guide. I examined each of
the phases, noting how buyers’ and sellers’ beliefs
concerning trust and trustworthiness both emerged
from and affected the activities taking place. I used
standard cross-case analysis techniques (Eisenhardt, 1989) to look for patterns and revisited the
data often, using charts and tables to facilitate comparisons between cases (Miles & Huberman, 1984;
Yin, 2003).

FINDINGS
Trust Asymmetries and the Acquisition Process
In this section, I address how buyers’ and sellers’
trust-related views both emerge from and influence
events throughout the phases of the acquisition
process. I find asymmetries between buyers and
sellers regarding whether trust is important in the
transaction and find both asymmetries and errors
in firms’ assessments of whether their counterparts
are trustworthy and trusting. In the screening
phase, sellers eliminate distrusted partners, but

<-----Page 7----->442

Academy of Management Journal

buyers do not. This creates a fundamental asymmetry in which most sellers trust their buyers, but
most buyers distrust their sellers. During the next
two phases of the acquisition process, socializing
and agreeing in principle, trust asymmetries grow
and deception is common, particularly among buyers. Deception ranges from negotiation-related
bluffing to more serious, material deception. The
occurrence and form of deception are related to
whether the deceiver trusts and feels trusted by the
other party. However, beliefs about whether the
other party is trustworthy and/or trusting are often
inaccurate. In the legalization phase, asymmetric
views of one another’s trustworthiness lead most
buyers, but few sellers, to engage in extensive due
diligence and to implement protective deal terms.
During postdeal implementation, deception may be
revealed and trust damaged. I explore why buyers
are willing to behave deceptively, despite potential
risks to postdeal cooperation and industry reputation. Finally, I outline the complex relationships
between trust asymmetries, trust errors, and acquisition behavior and explore implications for developing a broader theory of trust asymmetry in interorganizational transactions.
Screening: Emergence of Trust Asymmetries
For both buyers and sellers, the acquisition process began with the decision to pursue some form
of partnership with another firm. Firm leaders
viewed partnerships as opportunities to obtain
technologies, products, and expertise more quickly
than they could be developed internally. As a business development executive at Checkmate commented, “It is all about timing. It is like a race in
this market.” Having decided to seek a partnership,
firm leaders faced two intertwined, and often simultaneous, sets of decisions: choosing the best
form of partnership, and choosing the best partner.
Forms of partnership. Although partnerships
can take many forms, leaders of both buyers and
sellers focused their initial decision making on the
broad choices of acquisition or alliance. Prior work
has proposed several theoretical explanations for
firms’ decisions to acquire rather than ally (for reviews, see Schilling and Steensma [2002], Villalonga and McGahan [2005], and Wang and Zajac
[2007]), and these theories have differing implications for the role of trust in acquisitions. One explanation draws upon transaction cost economics
(Williamson, 1975, 1985), focusing on a firm’s need
to minimize opportunistic behavior by transaction
partners. If concerns over opportunism are relatively low, alliance is considered more efficient
than acquisition (Alston & Gillespie, 1989; Schill-

June

ing & Steensma, 2002). However, alliances may
enable partners to misappropriate knowledge
(Steensma & Corley, 2000), particularly in technology-intensive industries (Villalonga & McGahan,
2005). In addition, alliances often require renegotiation at a later date, subjecting a firm to “smallnumbers bargaining” and possible exploitation by
its partner (Pisano, 1990). Acquisition avoids both
problems, since it provides the acquirer with the
ability to monitor and control the acquired organization and to redirect its activities without engaging in renegotiation. Therefore, if the risk of opportunism is high, transaction cost arguments favor
acquisition over alliance.
A second explanation for the choice between alliances and acquisitions draws from real options
theory (Folta & Miller, 2002; McGrath, 2000). Alliances may offer firms greater flexibility since they
are easier to reverse than acquisitions, yet still offer
the larger firm the option of later acquiring the
target (Kogut, 1991). Such flexibility is particularly
important if there is uncertainty regarding whether
a technology will work or will have commercial
success (Steensma & Corley, 2001).
A third theoretical explanation for firms’ choice
between acquisition and alliance draws on the resource-based (Wernerfelt, 1984) and knowledgebased (Grant, 1996) views of the firm. These perspectives focus on creating sustainable competitive
advantage and suggest that acquisitions offer two
advantages over alliances. First, the hierarchical
control resulting from an acquisition may promote
faster and more effective coordination of knowledge-based resources across multiple individuals
(Conner & Prahalad, 1996). Second, acquisition
provides the buyer with exclusive access to the
target’s technology and expertise, providing the
buyer with a resource that is unique and difficult to
imitate (Kale & Puranam, 2004). In contrast, even
an exclusive alliance leaves open the possibility
that a partner could eventually be acquired by a
competitor of the larger firm.
To the extent that acquisitions are motivated by
transaction cost concerns, we might expect buyers
to be likely to distrust their targets. In contrast, real
options and resource-based explanations for acquisition versus alliance decisions have no clear implications for whether trust would or would not be
present in an acquisition (Conner & Prahalad,
1996). In the current study, both transaction cost
and real options explanations received some limited support. Harbor’s leaders expressed a transaction cost logic for choosing between alliance and
acquisition, while Picasso’s leaders expressed a
real options logic, indicating that alliances and minority investments were useful for exploring uncer-

tain technologies without the commitment of an
acquisition. No other firms mentioned either transaction cost or real options rationales for choosing
acquisition rather than alliance. Table 2 summarizes the rationales for the studied acquisitions.
As in other research on technology acquisitions
during this time period (Uhlenbruck, Hitt, & Semadeni, 2006), resource- and knowledge-based perspectives played a more prominent role in acquir-

ers’ decisions. The desire to keep a target’s skills
and expertise out of the hands of competitors was a
motivator for five of the eight acquirers. A vice
president at Craze explained, “We’ve created a
portfolio of the best companies. . . . We’ve acquired
the best companies off the market, so no one else
could.” A need for closer coordination also motivated buyers to seek acquisition rather than alliance. A business development executive at Picasso

<-----Page 10----->2009

reasoned, “This market was going to be strategic for
us. We needed to have a full set of products in our
portfolio. . . . You need to have the technology inhouse so that you can provide an end-to-end solution. You can’t do that with a partner’s product.”
Sellers also played an important role in the decision to engage in an acquisition rather than an
alliance. Like buyers, sellers viewed acquisition as
a means to achieve closer coordination and to ensure their partners did not combine with competitors instead. An executive at Isle explained, “Basically, whoever could get Harbor was going to be
automatically the leader in the space. . . . So that
was what drove our decision making.” In addition,
both buyers and sellers mentioned that acquisitions
played a signaling role that could not be fulfilled by
an alliance. Buyers viewed acquisitions as a signal
to financial analysts that their firms were able to
aggressively enter new markets. A board member at
Ciao reasoned, “The market sees right through business development deals. . . . The acquisition of
Goalie put a stake in the ground: we can acquire
companies, we can integrate companies, we know
how to think about synergistic businesses.” Sellers
viewed merging with a larger firm as signaling scale
and credibility to potential customers in a way that
alliances could not.
In sum, these acquisitions were primarily motivated by resource-based and signaling concerns,
and only secondarily by transaction cost logic.
Thus, the decision to participate in an acquisition
versus an alliance was not in itself an indication of
distrust. Nonetheless, as discussed below, clear
patterns of trust and distrust began to emerge as
buyers and sellers evaluated the pros and cons of
specific partners.
Choice of partners. In tandem with deciding
whether acquisition or alliance was more attractive, firm leaders evaluated specific partners. Both
buyers and sellers often considered many possible
partners. A leader at a seller, Concept, recalled,
“We had a list of people we thought would be good
candidates to get acquired by. . . . Somebody knows
somebody, that sort of thing.” Both buyers and
sellers narrowed their lists of potential partners on
the basis of strategic fit, including such characteristics as product line complementarity and technology platform similarity. For sellers, however, trustworthiness was also an important criterion for
screening partners. Potential buyers were favored if
they were perceived as trustworthy and were eliminated if perceived as not trustworthy. Table 3A
summarizes the role of trust in sellers’ screening of
buyers. Sellers based their judgments of trustworthiness on prior direct relationships, including
friendships and business partnerships; shared

Graebner

third-party ties; industry reputation; and impressions formed during initial partnership-related
conversations.
For example, Monet’s leaders favored one buyer,
Picasso, because of its industry reputation for trustworthiness. According to Monet’s chief financial
officer, “Screwing companies is not Picasso’s reputation.” Conversely, Monet’s leaders refused to
consider acquisition by a potential buyer that they
did not trust, as Monet’s CEO explained:
We have the same board chairman as they do, but
we didn’t like their CEO. He’s dishonest. He tries to
negotiate deals with employees behind the backs of
investors. He is just not somebody our management
team wanted to do business with.

Monet was not unusual. Eleven of the 12 sellers,
including both management-controlled and investor-controlled firms, indicated that trust was a significant criterion for screening buyers. If a seller
distrusted a buyer, talks ended quickly. Sellers who
distrusted all of the buyers approaching them simply rejected all offers and remained independent.
The CEO of Evergreen explained why she rebuffed
all of her company’s potential suitors thus: “We
were really suspicious of them. We trusted them
zip.”
Buyers did not demonstrate a reciprocal concern
for the trustworthiness of sellers, however. Table
3B summarizes the role of trust in buyers’ screening
of sellers. Although buyers were not acquiring targets because of distrust per se, lack of trust was not
viewed as a reason to eliminate a target, either. Six
of the eight buyers expressed distrust in their eventual targets. Buyers suspected these sellers of hiding their motives, exaggerating the state of their
technology development, and secretly negotiating
with other parties. Typical buyer comments included: “This all seemed like ‘vaporware,’” “They
showed a demo, but demos are always smoke and
mirrors,” and “They were playing us.” Nonetheless, buyers were willing to acquire these targets.
Why might buyers and sellers assess the importance of trust in acquisitions so differently? One
potential explanation is that buyers chose to acquire precisely because they distrusted the target.
However, as noted earlier, fear of opportunism was
not the primary motivator for these acquisitions. A
second explanation is that sellers were younger,
less experienced firms, and perhaps were more naı̈ve than buyers about acquisitions. These distinctions likely had an impact, but the data suggest
disparities in experience cannot be the entire explanation. First, both seasoned (e.g., Picasso) and

novice (e.g., Harbor) acquirers were willing to negotiate with distrusted targets. Moreover, although
no selling firm had previously been acquired, many
individual selling firm leaders had experience with
acquisitions at other firms. Yet both more- and lessexperienced selling firm leaders valued trustworthiness in their buyers.
A final explanation arises from considering the
roles that buyers and sellers have in the acquisition

process, the risks that are involved, and the shift in
power that occurs after deals close. In the course of
an acquisition, sellers lose power while buyers gain
power. This asymmetry is an inherent feature of
acquisitions, regardless of the motivation for a deal
or the experience levels of either buyer or seller.
This shift in power seems to have engendered buyers’ and sellers’ disparate views of the importance
of trustworthiness.

Power, risk, and the importance of trust. The
buyers and sellers in this study began the acquisition process with approximately equal bargaining
power. As one buyer noted, “Quite honestly, they
needed us as much as we needed them.” Powerdependence theory (Emerson, 1972a, 1972b) suggests that actors have power in an exchange if they
have viable alternatives—that is, if their desired
resource is available from more than one potential

partner. Both buyers and sellers had alternatives to
acquisition, allowing them to walk away from unattractive deals. Sellers typically had multiple
would-be suitors as well as investors willing to
further fund them as independent firms, and buyers had multiple would-be targets offering roughly
comparable technologies. A vice president at Ciao
noted this: “There are two companies a week that
want to be acquired by us. It’s just overwhelming.”

<-----Page 13----->448

Academy of Management Journal

Yet after the deal closed, a buyer’s and seller’s
relative power would be very different. The buyer
typically dominates key managerial positions as
well as the board of directors of the combined firm
(Harford, 2003; Hartzell, Ofek, & Yermack, 2004;
Wulf, 2004). Given their prospects of heightened
power, buyers viewed sellers’ trustworthiness as
nonessential. A leader of Craze explained that if he
did not trust a seller, Craze would simply plan
more intensive postdeal intervention:
If we are to acquire this, we need to come in immediately with an integration team, pour effort into beefing
this up and making it work. . . . If the motivation is
there from a revenue and market perspective, the outlook is pretty much, “You have to make it work, no
matter what.” We could have swooped in right away
and “Oh my God, this is going to be hard” and fixed it.

Sellers, however, lose power after acquisitions
close. Sellers face the risk that buyers will impose
unwelcome practices and strategies on acquired
firms (Jemison & Sitkin, 1986), replace acquired
managers, change leadership succession plans
(Hartzell et al., 2004), or even close acquired firms
entirely (Santos & Eisenhardt, 2009). If a buyer had
deceived them during negotiations, the seller’s top
management team and employees would suffer. A
vice president at Trend commented on the sense of
obligation she felt toward her employees: “You feel
an incredible amount of responsibility for helping
these employees. . . . My biggest concern was that
they not be disregarded, that they be given good
positions.” Similarly, the CEO of Model remarked:
When I think of [employee], I think, “He deserves
the best possible place to work that the world can
possibly give him, because he’s that kind of person.”
I feel that tremendous debt of gratitude for the employees. . . . I’m looking for a company that values
people as well as results.

Although these arguments help explain managers’ preferences for trustworthy buyers, an intriguing question is why sellers’ investors would support such preferences. Agency theory suggests that
although selling firm executives might prefer a
trustworthy buyer for the sake of themselves or
their employees, investors would be concerned
only with obtaining the highest price (Jensen &
Ruback, 1983).2 However, in this sample, both
manager-controlled (e.g., Rocket, Isle, Goalie, Spur)
and investor-controlled (e.g., Monet, Trend, Con-

value offer from those presented to them” (Jensen &
Ruback, 1983: 6).

cept, Junket) firms screened buyers on the basis of
trust. Investors in these ventures believed that only
senior management could decide whether and to
whom to sell a company. A venture capitalist and
board member in Junket, an investor-controlled
firm, commented: “This is a personal philosophy
issue. I will not make any decisions for management. They have to make that call.” One reason that
venture capitalists did not want to force the hands
of managers was concern about access to future
investment opportunities. Venture capitalists compete for access to attractive investments, and a negative reputation among entrepreneurs could be a
competitive liability. A venture capital investor in
Evergreen explained, “As a venture investor, your
reputation is part of what makes you successful,
and entrepreneurs, if you do wrong by them, they
are not going to come back to work with you.”
A final question is why buyers so often distrusted
their sellers. Assuming that concerns over opportunism were not the primary reason for acquiring,
there is no a priori reason why buyers would be
more likely to acquire distrusted versus trusted
companies. The explanation seems to be twofold.
First, buyers (and sellers) had a generalized distrust
of most potential partners. The firms were engaged
in rapidly changing and intensely competitive markets. As technologies developed, adjacent markets
and products converged, and partners who began
in slightly different sectors could quickly become
competitors. Experimental evidence suggests that
as conflict becomes more salient, exchange partners are less likely to be viewed as trustworthy
(Molm, Peterson, & Takahashi, 2003). Similarly,
competitive industry dynamics seemed to foster a
“predator or prey” mind-set that encouraged wariness of outside firms. Second, selling firms were
generally younger and smaller than buyers. As a
result, buyers were somewhat more likely than targets to feel that they lacked sufficient knowledge to
trust their counterparts (cf. Kotha, Rajgopal, & Venkatachalam, 2004). One buyer commented about a
target thus: “We tried to dig out information on
them. . . . But the best we could find was they were
working at an apartment on Sand Hill Road.”
Socializing: Trust Asymmetries and
Conflicting Interpretations
Once a buyer and seller had identified acquisition as an attractive means of partnering and identified one another as attractive partners, the next
phase was typically socializing between the leaders
of the two firms. In six of the eight completed
acquisitions, buyer and seller leaders met informally in nonoffice settings, including restaurants,

both buyer and seller, the conversation topics were

much more personal, including college memories,
hobbies, and life philosophies.
Buyers and sellers had distinct and often con-

flicting interpretations of these social interactions.
Sellers viewed socializing through the lens of trust
formation, and they perceived social interaction as
building deeper relationships through honest exchange of information. Buyers viewed the same
events through the lens of bargaining and saw social interaction as a way to gain influence over
sellers. As a result, the disparity between buyers’
and sellers’ views of one another’s trustworthiness
grew. At the same time, socializing influenced both
parties’ emerging beliefs regarding whether they
were trusted by their counterparts. Firm leaders’
views of whether their counterparts were trusting,
as well as trustworthy, played an important role in
shaping subsequent behavior, particularly deceit.
Table 4 presents case information and exemplary
quotations about socializing and its interpretation.
Deepening of sellers’ trust. For sellers, socializing was an opportunity to deepen trust by developing sincere personal relationships with buyers. For
buyers, informal interaction was an opportunity to
gain bargaining leverage by gathering information,
engaging in ingratiation, and isolating sellers from
their legal and financial advisors. Trend and its
buyer, Armor, offer an example. Early in the two
firms’ acquisition talks, Armor’s CEO invited
Trend’s CEO to his home for an evening. An Armor
vice president observed that the conversation
strayed from acquisition: “[The CEOs] just shot
the s—. We didn’t talk much about the company.”
On the basis of this personal interaction, Trend’s
leaders trusted Armor sufficiently to refuse an attractive offer from a competing bidder, even before
receiving a formal written offer from Armor’s
board. Armor’s leaders, however, viewed socializing with Trend’s CEO as a negotiating tactic intended to prevent Trend from accepting an acquisition offer from Armor’s biggest competitor.
Armor’s vice president of business development
explained:
We tripped over the fact that one of our competitors
was actually in the midst of attempting to do an
acquisition of them. I called our CEO and said, “Get
your butt down here! This company is off the charts
compared to everything else we’ve looked at. We
can’t let this happen.” What our CEO did, which is
what he does so well, is he sat down with [Trend’s
CEO] personally. They spent the afternoon together.
And then he asked [Trend’s CEO] to come over later
that evening and sit down and talk with him. We
spent the rest of the evening talking about things
other than the acquisition. We talked about his aspirations, our aspirations. I think [Trend’s CEO]
very much enjoyed the conversation.

The vice president regarded this socializing, or
“bear hugging,” as an excellent persuasion tool:

June

It stood out as a very good move that we made. We
“bear-hugged” them at just the right moment. Those
two days that we spent with their people were very
effective. Slowly but surely, the management began
realizing they didn’t want to work for the other
buyer.

Fortunately for Trend’s leaders, Armor’s statements to Trend during the socializing process were
essentially accurate. This was not true for other
buyers. Most buyers neither expected sellers to be
trustworthy during social interactions, nor felt obligated to be trustworthy themselves. An illustration of this pattern is the case of Rocket and North.
Rocket was in the process of raising a round of
venture capital financing when approached by
North about a potential partnership, possibly including an acquisition. Rocket’s CEO and North’s
business unit head began a series of informal meetings at a nearby coffeehouse. Rocket’s CEO viewed
these talks as an honest exchange of information
that built a personal relationship and reinforced his
trust in North. He recalled:
We met off and on from January to July. It was a
good time for us both to learn. We were pretty open,
too. We got to trust them that way. We told them we
were on an IPO track and talking with venture capitalists. Openness is the best policy.

North’s representative felt quite differently
about the meetings, saying, “We were just fishing
information from them.” He explained that he
viewed the coffeehouse sessions as a way to improve North’s bargaining position by convincing
Rocket not to take additional venture capital investment, which would have increased Rocket’s
valuation. As a stalling tactic, he intentionally
misled Rocket’s CEO by suggesting that North
would be willing to provide capital to Rocket as
an independent firm:
That was a tricky time. [Rocket] had some [venture
capital] term sheets on the table. The company
would have been more expensive after VCs got in.
North pretended [we were] interested in throwing in
$5 to $10 million for a VC round. That was the
official story. I think my role and actions were to
keep friendly conversation open and daily contact. I
was making sure they didn’t sign the VC stuff. I sat
with [Rocket CEO] in the Starbucks cafe having conversations about life and the universe and everything. It was this endless discussion.

North’s representative concluded that the informal conversations had “worked really well” in
persuading Rocket to decline financing and pursue acquisition.

buyers, socializing provided an opportunity for
both buyers and sellers to develop beliefs regarding
whether they were trusted by their counterparts.
Surprisingly, these assessments were often wrong.
Table 5 contrasts the actual and perceived trust of
both parties. Five sellers (Monet, Rocket, Concept,
Goalie, and Prime) misread whether their buyers
trusted them. Four of these five sellers believed
they were trusted by buyers, when the opposite was
true. Two buyers (North and Karma) also made
errors. In both cases, buyers mistakenly believed
that sellers did not trust them.
In the case of Rocket and North, both buyer and
seller were mistaken. Their informal interaction
at the coffeehouse left Rocket’s CEO feeling that
North’s leader was demonstrating his trust in
Rocket by being very forthcoming. Rocket’s CEO
commented that North’s leader “probably told us
more than he should about their business strategy
and how we fit in.” In fact, North’s representative
distrusted Rocket’s CEO, commenting, “We had
to be careful . . . it was worrying that we didn’t
know what he was after.” For his part, North’s

leader erroneously believed that Rocket’s CEO
viewed him with skepticism and knew that he
was not being entirely honest. Although North
pretended to be interested in providing venture
capital rather than acquiring Rocket, North’s
leader believed that Rocket’s CEO was savvy
enough to know better: “I don’t believe that he was
naı̈ve enough [to think] nothing was going on.”
Whether correct or not, leaders’ views of the
other firm’s trust, as well as its trustworthiness,
influenced leaders’ behavior in important ways.
Specifically, leaders’ views of whether their
counterparts were trustworthy and/or trusting
shaped decisions regarding whether to behave
deceptively. This influence became particularly
apparent during the next phase of the acquisition
process.
Agreeing in Principle: Trust, Distrust,
and Deception
Agreeing in principle, which often followed
quickly after socializing, involved signing a non-

<-----Page 18----->2009

binding acquisition letter of intent, or term sheet,3
outlining the proposed deal. Signing a letter of
intent could be a risky matter, particularly for sellers. Term sheets typically include a legally binding
“no-shop” clause that requires the two firms to
negotiate exclusively until either the deal closes or
a specified time period expires. If the acquisition
fails to come to fruition, both buyer and seller
could lose valuable time in their searches for suitable partners. For sellers, an even more critical
issue was delays in raising additional capital. Sellers often put fundraising plans on hold during acquisition talks, which put their solvency at risk if
the buyer withdrew from the deal.
However, because most sellers trusted their buyers, they viewed an agreement in principle as tantamount to a completed deal. Sellers expected that
once a letter of intent had been signed, the remaining details were formalities. A Goalie founder explained that he had no doubt that Ciao would fulfill
its promise to complete the acquisition: “Even
though we [still] had to talk to the lawyers a lot, we
basically had agreed to compromise on all the issues. If you can trust them, you feel like they’re
good people, and all of the small little details will
be worked out.”
Buyers approached the letter of intent differently, as a means of gathering additional information before making a final decision about the deal.
As an executive from North commented, “Our ambition with the term sheet is basically to get in and
do some due diligence, to make sure the technical
side is working.” Moreover, many buyers behaved
deceptively during this phase. Deception took two
forms: negotiation-related deception, or “bluffing,”
and a more serious form of misrepresentation,
which will be termed material deception.4 Both
forms were related to the deceiver’s beliefs concerning whether the opposite party was trustworthy and/or trusting. Table 6A summarizes information on buyers’ trust and perceived trust and offers
illustrative evidence on buyers’ deception, and Table 6B presents similar information for sellers.

3
Technically, a term sheet is an attachment to a
letter of intent. However, informants used the terms
interchangeably.
4
Note that this form of deception was not necessarily “material” in the legal sense of constituting fraud.
The U.S. legal system allows for considerable misrepresentation within negotiation contexts, and participants are usually protected from fraud allegations if
they abide by the letter of a contract, regardless of
statements made during negotiations (Schweitzer,
2005; Shell, 1991).

Negotiation-related deception. Negotiation-related deception involved providing misleading information about the presence of alternative targets
or buyers, the prices of competing offers, and deadlines for making decisions. Negotiation-related deception was common, with seven of the eight buyers and three of the eight sellers exhibiting this
behavior (Tables 6A and 6B). Both young firms
(e.g., Concept and Karma) and large, experienced
firms (e.g., Picasso and North) engaged in negotiation-related deception.
An example is the buyer Harbor. Harbor intentionally misled Isle’s leaders about how much Harbor was willing to pay for the company. A Harbor
executive recalled, “We started out at a pretty low
number, and we negotiated pretty hard to keep it
low . . . they certainly had a lot more room to go.
Which, to this day, they’re not aware of. They were
at a pretty big disadvantage.” A second example is
the seller Craze, which manipulated buyers’ views
regarding the presence of competing bidders. A
Craze board member explained that the negotiation
involved “A lot of ‘Kabuki theater.’ I mean, a lot of
effort was made to make the buyers believe that
certain companies were part of the auction process.”
One reason that negotiation-related deception
was so common is that bluffing was viewed as a
widespread practice in bargaining situations. In the
words of one informant, acquisition talks are “like
a poker game.” This view is consistent with statements in the negotiation literature that bluffing is
“an accepted part of the negotiation process”
(Schweitzer, 2005: 3). Because negotiation-related
deception was viewed as so commonplace, only in
a narrow set of circumstances would firm leaders
not engage in this behavior. As Tables 6A and 6B
indicate, only when firm leaders both trusted and
felt trusted by their counterparts did they refrain
from negotiation-related bluffing. Figures 1A and
1B demonstrate this pattern graphically.
The combination of trusting and feeling trusted
by the opposite firm seemed to trigger a logic of
cooperation, partnership, and fairness that discouraged any deception, even negotiation-related bluffing. Armor, the lone buyer to not engage in any
deception, both trusted and felt trusted by its target.
Armor’s CEO explained how these views shaped
the negotiation process: “We just sat down and
ballparked a number. We didn’t try to play hardball
and we tried to be generous. The term sheet was
very simple.” Sellers generally followed the same
pattern as buyers, refraining from negotiation-related deception if (and only if) they both trusted
and felt trusted by their counterparts. However,

Material deception. Some firms also engaged in
a second form of misrepresentation, which I term
“material deception.” Material deception pertained
to topics that went beyond bluffing about prices or
competing offers. For buyers, material deception
involved misleading the seller about postintegration plans such as layoffs, relocation of personnel,
changes in strategic direction, or diminished roles
for senior managers. For sellers, material deception
involved misleading the buyer about the status of
the seller’s product development efforts, the inten-

tions of key personnel to remain with the firm, or
other issues related to the buyer’s future ability to
realize value from the acquisition.
Material deception was viewed as a more serious
matter than negotiation-related bluffing. The same
informant who compared negotiation to a poker
game felt material deception was unacceptable,
arguing:
You have to be very candid in these discussions
about what your objectives are. You can’t make

things up, “I intend to stay for the next two years,
and I’ll stick around,” knowing that I’ll pull the plug
one month later. I think not being honest about
things is a mistake.

As Tables 6A and 6B indicate, material deception
occurred less frequently than negotiation-related
deception. Firm leaders seemed to use a different
logic when considering whether to engage in this
more serious form of deceit. Like negotiationrelated deception, material deception was linked to
whether leaders trusted and felt trusted by their
counterparts in the other firm; however, a more
restrictive set of conditions had to be present for
material deception to occur. Figures 2A and 2B
illustrate patterns of trust and material deception,
indicating that firms only engaged in material deception when they distrusted but believed they
were trusted by their counterparts.
An example is the case of Goalie and its buyer,

Ciao. Prior to acquisition discussions, Ciao leaders
had assisted Goalie with introductions to venture
capital investors. Ciao correctly observed that
through this process, Goalie had developed trust in
one of Ciao’s investors and board members. A Ciao
vice president commented, “Goalie really trusted
[our board member]. To some extent they trusted
him more than they trusted their own financial
advisors.’” Ciao did not trust Goalie, however, as
Ciao’s CEO explained: “There was this question
about what’s the truth and what isn’t the truth of
the deal. You’re saying this, but what are you really
going to do?”
Goalie’s trust in Ciao provided Ciao’s leaders
with the opportunity to behave deceptively. Ciao’s
board member acknowledged the temptation: “If
you get someone who doesn’t know what they’re
doing, you can take advantage. . . . You like to take
advantage where it’s to your benefit.” Moreover,

believing that Goalie was not trustworthy provided
a rationale for justifying this behavior. Psychological research suggests that a fear of exploitation provides a moral justification for deception based on
self-defense (Bazerman, Curhan, Moore, & Valley,
2000; Steinel & De Dreu, 2004). Similarly, Ciao’s
board member explained his negotiating tactics as
self-protection: “Here’s the way we thought about
it: we tried to limit our downside . . . so we played
a bit of the tough guy.”
Facing the combined forces of temptation and
fear, Ciao leaders engaged in material deception
toward Goalie. Goalie’s founders were insistent
that none of their employees be terminated as a
result of the acquisition and that their company not
be relocated. Ciao leaders assured them this would
not happen, despite secretly intending to lay off the
majority of Goalie’s personnel and move the company to California. A Ciao board member recalled:
We only need five of their employees, [but] we
didn’t go and tell them, “Hey, what we’re going to
do is go out and fire ten people.” We specifically
said, “You can keep the business as-is, running in
New York, through April.” So we’re buying ourselves some time. And then on April 15, we say,
“Here’s who has to move.”

Because they trusted Ciao, Goalie’s leaders took
Ciao’s representations at face value. Goalie’s CEO
affirmed that relocating was “the one thing that was
nonnegotiable about the deal,” and another Goalie
executive said, “There’s literally no overlap—no
one who’s going to get fired. No layoffs.”
Two other buyers, Harbor and Checkmate, also
distrusted their targets but felt trusted by them.
Like Ciao, both Harbor and Checkmate engaged in
material deception. However, as indicated by Figure 2b, no seller fell into the category of distrusting
but feeling trusted by the buyer, and no seller engaged in material deception. It is worth nothing
that material deception by sellers was not impossible. Craze leaders related the story of a previous
acquisition in which the seller had provided misleading information about headcount in a critical
area. That acquisition differed from the other cases
in that the seller was engaging with Craze not by
choice, but by necessity, because the seller’s originally preferred buyer had just been acquired by
another firm. As this example suggests, material
deception by sellers was possible, but unlikely,
because most sellers only engaged in conversations
with buyers they trusted.
Seller trust and buyer deception. The frequency
of deception by buyers raises the question of why
sellers originally believed these buyers were trustworthy—and how they could so often be mistaken.

Prior research suggests that interfirm trust emerges
gradually from a combination of direct experience,
reputation, and third-party referrals (Gulati, 1995;
Larson, 1992; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Sako &
Helper, 1998; Uzzi, 1997), which provide “timely,
relevant information on the . . . reliability of potential partners” (Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999: 1446). Similarly, sellers based their assessments of trustworthiness on direct experience from friendships and
previous professional interactions, on a buyer’s
general industry reputation, and on shared ties
with third parties such as investors and past employers. However, these sources did not seem to be
reliable predictors of a buyer’s behavior in an acquisition. One reason is that acquisition situations
may trigger behavior that is not seen under other
circumstances, such as personal friendship or even
interfirm alliance. Prior interactions between buyer
and seller are likely to differ greatly from an acquisition in risk and importance. Acquisitions involve
high stakes, which can foster deception and other
competitive behavior (Gneezy, 2005; Tenbrusel,
1998). An informant from one buyer observed that the
acquisition context generated a marked change in
his own firm’s senior executives. When a deal was
in jeopardy, the executives turned from “mild-mannered” and “chummy” to angry and calculating:
They were livid. It’s interesting to sit in on a board
meeting, because our CFO and chief legal guy are
very mild-mannered, but they were really mad. And
it’s interesting to hear the CFO saying, “We really
want to dominate the world.” He’s a really chummy
sort of guy.

In several cases, buyers were experienced acquirers, providing sellers the opportunity to seek information about buyers’ previous behavior in acquisition settings. Yet even this information was not
necessarily predictive of buyers’ actions in subsequent acquisitions. Acquisitions are heterogeneous
events (Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1999; Zollo &
Singh, 2004). As a leader from Craze explained,
“Things change here all the time. [Acquisitions] are
not cookie-cutter.” Buyers’ circumstances and behavior could change in a variety of ways from one
acquisition to the next. One serial acquirer even
described making a conscious decision to become
less honest in future deals. The CEO had tried in a
previous acquisition to be very open and “show
[the acquirees] what nice guys we were,” but after
experiencing disappointing results, had decided in
future acquisitions to “be quite a bit more ruthless . . . go in with a fairly Machiavellian set of
rules.” Finally, the model developed here suggests
that a buyer’s actions may differ dramatically depending on whether the buyer views a specific

<-----Page 23----->458

Academy of Management Journal

seller as trustworthy and/or trusting. As a result, in
one acquisition a buyer may be quite honest, but
in the next, highly deceptive. All of these factors
may make it difficult for sellers to accurately predict whether a buyer will behave deceptively in a
specific acquisition.
Legalization: Trust Asymmetries and Precautions
The fourth phase of the acquisition process, legalization, refers to the period between signing an
agreement in principle and officially closing the
deal. The legalization period provides a final
chance for both buyers and sellers to protect themselves against counterparts’ dishonesty. During this
period, both firms can take precautions, including
checking references on the other party’s leaders,
validating information about the opposing firm’s
technology and strategic plans, and designing deal
terms to defend against possible misrepresentations. Table 7 presents evidence about this stage for
each case.
Buyers typically took advantage of the legalization phase, conducting extensive due diligence
and developing deal terms such as escrow periods
that protected the buyer if target leaders had behaved deceptively. An example is Craze. Like most
buyers, Craze conducted careful due diligence
on its target, reviewing important customer contracts, examining the quality of the seller’s technology, and even probing relationships among employees. Craze’s chief technology officer outlined
this process:
As we go further in the diligence, then we may ask
for some more detail. Sometimes you notice that a
certain person doesn’t want to work with this person, or they actually happen to mention that their
business model won’t survive beyond next year, so
these tidbits of information. . . . [And] legal will ask
about all their customer agreements and license
agreements. We try to evaluate what components
the software is built out of, the cost of those components going forward, and will this be expensive to
continue to develop and deploy? You ask those
questions in the initial overview, and then in the
second level of the diligence, you actually drill
down to seeing the contract, worldwide license, etc.

Seven of the eight buyers described both conducting due diligence and implementing deal terms to
protect themselves against any misrepresentation
by their targets.
It was possible for sellers to take similar precautions. For example, Trend’s leaders described gathering financial analysts’ reports to get outside assessments of Arbor’s management team and hiring
an investment bank to assess Arbor’s financial

June

prospects. Fastlane’s CEO demanded a “sizeable
break-up fee” to guarantee interim financing if
Craze withdrew from the acquisition deal. Yet
Trend and Fastlane were the only two of the eight
sellers to take significant precautions during legalization. Four sellers did not describe taking any
steps to safeguard against a buyer’s possible dishonesty, and the remaining two sellers took only
minimal steps, engaging in limited due diligence.
For example, an officer at Monet commented, “I
asked a few friends at other Picasso acquisitions,
and they verified what we thought. But we didn’t
do any systematic checking.” Moreover, none of the
eight sellers used both due diligence and deal terms
to protect themselves.
A partial explanation for these differences is that
sellers were smaller firms with limited resources to
expend investigating buyers. In addition, because
they were privately held, sellers did not face the
prospect of shareholder lawsuits if their due diligence were lacking. However, these factors do not
appear to tell the whole story. Even in the two cases
in which the buyers were privately held and relatively safe from shareholder lawsuits, the firms
took far more precautions than sellers. Moreover,
while sellers did not have unlimited resources,
they did have the assistance of high-caliber attorneys and experienced investors, many of whom
gave cautionary advice. Yet sellers often did not
heed the advice that these counselors provided. For
example, one of Monet’s board members, a partner
at a prestigious venture capital firm, was concerned
that Picasso was behaving opportunistically toward
Monet during negotiations. He advised Monet to
hire an investment bank, to no avail:
I tried to interject the help of getting a bank involved, but the company said no. “Let me handle
it,” said our CEO. The whole point of this game is
that if you let time go by, you lose leverage. And
Picasso doesn’t let time go by. It is, “Strike this deal,
strike this deal.” We could’ve interrupted that if
we’d done the right things, but there wasn’t any
inclination to.

Monet’s leaders also disregarded legal advice suggesting they were vulnerable to Picasso. Monet’s
chief financial officer explained:
The lawyers warned us about what we were doing,
but didn’t drive the process. They warned us that
the option agreement locked us with Picasso and left
us vulnerable. So the lawyers did their jobs. But we
went ahead anyway because we figured that Picasso
would treat us fairly.

As this quotation suggests, one reason that selling
firm leaders took fewer precautions during legaliza-

tion is that, unlike buyers, they believed they were
dealing with trustworthy parties. One seller reasoned:
You have to know who you’re working with and
whether you can trust them. No matter how long the
document, no matter what the reps and warranties and
indemnifications, you can never capture in a docu-

ment the spirit of the deal. And it’s going to work not
because of the document you create, but because of the
way the two parties work together.

Due diligence and contractual safeguards simply
did not seem necessary to sellers when dealing
with trusted buyers.

<-----Page 26----->2009

This pattern of behavior raises the question of
how buyers could engage in extensive due diligence and propose complex deal terms without
raising doubts in sellers’ minds about whether
buyers trusted them or were trustworthy. Buyers
succeeded in this behavior partly by designating
specific roles to be played by different individuals within their firms. The individual who had
socialized with the seller stayed away from difficult conversations. A vice president at Trend
explained:
[Our chief financial officer] did the negotiation—I
don’t do negotiating, because I’m supposed to be
their friend. And that’s one of the things we do: we
divide up the responsibility. There is a Dr. No. I stay
pristine because I’m the bear-hug guy. . . . So Dr. No
is the CFO.

Ciao employed a similar separation of roles when
legalizing the deal with Goalie. This strategy allowed sellers to attribute an individual’s aggressive
bargaining behavior to the characteristics of this
person, rather than to the characteristics of a buying firm as a whole. When dealing with the tough
CEO of Ciao, Goalie’s leaders attributed his behavior to being new at his job: “I could not get a feeling
for him. He was more evasive. And that was because he just started. He had a ton of cleaning up to
do.” Separation of roles led sellers to continue to
trust and feel trusted by buyers, even as buyers
protected their own interests.
Implementation: Distrust and Misperceptions of
Seller Goals
A surprising aspect of buyers’ behavior during
acquisition negotiations was their apparent lack of
concern with the potential consequences of deception. Negotiation-related deception might never be
revealed (some buyers commented that even after
deals had closed, sellers did not realize they had
been deceived), and it was viewed as only slightly
reprehensible, suggesting that even if caught by
their negotiation counterparts, deceivers might not
suffer substantial repercussions. However, material
deception was another matter. Before deal close,
selling firm leaders discussed a variety of goals
with buyers and typically believed they had established satisfactory informal agreements regarding
issues such as the destiny of the seller’s technologies, the degree of autonomy acquired leaders
would have in the combined firm, and employee
terminations and relocations. After the deals
closed, if buyers began to implement layoffs, relocations, and other unexpected strategic changes,
sellers could realize they had been deceived. More-

over, material deception occurred only in situations in which sellers trusted their buyers, suggesting sellers could feel particularly betrayed when
this deception was revealed. Even if the buyers felt
that material deception was morally justifiable, it
would seem to be a poor strategy for retaining and
motivating acquired employees.
One potential explanation for buyers’ readiness
to engage in material deception (despite knowing
they were likely to be caught) is that buyers were
acquiring companies primarily for their assets, and
they were not concerned with whether acquired
personnel remained with the firms. However, as in
other studies of technology acquisitions (Graebner,
2004; Granstrand & Sjolander, 1990; Ranft & Lord,
2002), the data suggest that retaining acquired employees was essential for realizing value from these
deals. One buyer noted, “Unless you retain the
leadership of the talent, you discount what you’ve
acquired fairly substantially.” Similarly, a leader
at Checkmate, one of the most deceptive buyers,
commented, “We are buying the top management
team.” Buyers’ inclination to behave deceptively
seemed to arise not from a willingness to lose acquired personnel, but from a belief that despite
being betrayed, acquirees could be retained and
motivated by appropriate financial incentives and
contractual terms. Because they distrusted their
targets, buyers doubted sellers’ stated goals and
priorities, believing sellers exaggerated their nonmonetary concerns. Table 8 summarizes evidence
regarding sellers’ actual goals and buyers’ beliefs
about sellers’ goals. A board member at Ciao dismissed Goalie’s statements about location, layoffs,
and autonomy, describing them as “blah blah blah”
and “playing mouthpiece.” He claimed that Goalie’s leaders “undoubtedly did [the acquisition] as
each one of them trying to figure out, ‘What’s the
best way to get dollars out of the system.’” Accordingly, Ciao leaders assumed that financial incentives would be sufficient to assuage any postdeal
disappointments for the seller.
Such assumptions did not always prove to be
accurate. For example, buyers Harbor and Checkmate distrusted their targets, but believed (correctly) that the targets trusted them. Both Harbor
and Checkmate engaged in negotiation-related and
material deception. The goals that Isle’s leaders
expressed to Harbor prior to deal close included
remaining in their original location, retaining autonomy, and finding the largest audience for their
technology. Isle’s chief technology officer said this
about himself:
“Me big geek.” I’m a technologist. I want to build
something that I want everyone to use and tell me

the people you think are critical to get this
done get economic benefits, but also are tied

Autonomy. “I wanted to structure a marketing organization—the chartering of the teams, the structure, what
are they supposed to do. I think you get to a point
where you want to make the decisions, you want to do
it your own way. . . . I have not been happy with what
I’m doing . . . am I walking away from money? Yes, I’m
walking away from money. You would say it’s a lot of
money.” (CEO)

Financial. “I modified my package because
they wanted to have something to reassure
some retention for me to stay. . . . The
acquiring company was worried about my
package. Are people going to stay? That kind

how wonderful I am. I want my ego boost! I’m not
here for a quick buck, I’m here to do my big thing.

Harbor’s leaders were aware of these desires but
intentionally misled Isle’s leaders in order to facilitate the deal, later admitting:
[We were] sort of half telling them what was going to
happen, and half still a sales pitch. It’s almost as if
we never really told them completely what we
wanted to do. We told them what they wanted us to
want to do.

Harbor’s leaders justified this behavior as necessary
to close the deal and avoid being exploited by Isle.
At the same time, Harbor’s leaders were relatively
unconcerned about deceiving Isle, because they believed that economic incentives would ultimately
pacify Isle’s leaders. As a manager at Harbor recalled, “In order to make the deal fairly palatable to
the players, we negotiated with them on the price.
They sure got a lot for a short amount of work, so I
don’t think they’re unhappy.” Harbor’s management viewed Isle’s financial gain as fair compensation for relocation, loss of autonomy, and changes
in technical direction. The leader of Harbor’s postmerger integration effort explained the message she
tried to convey to the acquirees: “‘You were just
bought, we just paid a lot of money. Do what we
say. You just have to do what we say.’”
When Harbor did not abide by informal agree-

ments, Isle leaders felt their trust had been betrayed, and many left their jobs, despite economic
incentives to stay. A Harbor executive described
how Isle’s leaders viewed a loss of autonomy as a
betrayal that money could not remedy:
[Isle leaders] genuinely felt that Harbor had committed to them that they could do their own thing. And
they just could not tolerate the fact that it would not
be that way. The founders were very unhappy with
the way this was going. These people are walking
away from a lot of money. The guy who just left
walked away from everything that was not vested.

Although still convinced that their deceptive tactics had served the purpose of closing the deal,
Harbor leaders began to realize that they had lost
valuable assets when Isle’s management departed. As a Harbor executive commented: “The
acquisition obviously was a disaster.”
Another example of a buyer’s erroneous assumptions about seller motives is the acquisition of Spur
and Prime by Checkmate. The CEOs of both selling
firms were experienced leaders who valued having
influence and believed Checkmate had agreed to
provide them with considerable responsibility. The
CEO of Prime said, “I have an employment agreement, but I’ve expressed myself to [Checkmate] that
as long as I’m helping, I’ll be here.” Similarly, the
CEO of Spur reported this: “What I’ve told Check-

can influence the company significantly and make
sure I’m not bored. If not, I’m not going to stay.”
The seller CEOs trusted Checkmate to comply with
these agreements, but Checkmate leaders did not
feel bound by their informal predeal conversations.
Instead, Checkmate’s CEO felt that the “economic
umbilical cord” was the “single best way to keep
somebody.” When Checkmate failed to provide influential positions, the CEOs of both Prime and
Spur became discontented and exited Checkmate
only months after their companies were acquired.
Spur’s leader explained that even before he left the
firm, he began withdrawing from his responsibilities: “At some point I realized I was just in for the
ride, so I hung out and didn’t do much. There’s
definitely some bitterness. I feel I’ve been used.”
Firm leaders seemed unhappily surprised by these
events, describing the results of the acquisition as
“abysmal” and “nonfunctioning.”
DISCUSSION
The objective of this study was to explore trust
and deception in acquisitions. In contrast to the
prevailing assumption in interorganizational trust
research that the members of a dyad share trusting
beliefs—that is, the assumption that trust is symmetric across a dyad (Dyer & Chu, 2000, 2003; Lui
& Ngo, 2004; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994; Schoorman
et al., 2007; Zaheer & Harris, 2005)—I found a more
complex pattern. Buyers and sellers often had
asymmetric views regarding whether trust was im-

portant in choosing a partner and whether their
counterparts were trustworthy. Moreover, both
buyers’ and sellers’ assessments of their counterparts’ trust and trustworthiness were often mistaken. Table 9 summarizes these asymmetries and
errors. This study has also explored underlying
causes for the trust asymmetries between buyers
and sellers and argued that these imbalances foster
seller vulnerability and buyer deceit.
In the discussion below, I examine the implications of these findings for developing a broader
theory of trust asymmetries in both acquisitions
and other interorganizational relationships. In a recent assessment of the state of organizational trust
research, Gulati and Sytch identified trust asymmetries as an important theoretical gap, asking, “What
are the antecedents of such asymmetries, how sustainable are those asymmetries, and what implications could they have for behavioral dynamics in
the dyad?” (2008: 277). Two other recent appraisals
of interorganizational trust research (Schoorman
et al., 2007; Zaheer & Harris, 2005) also identified
trust asymmetries as a significant gap in extant
theory. The following discussion is intended to
begin to address this oversight by examining the
emergence, persistence, and consequences of trust
asymmetries.
Trust Asymmetries: Emergence, Persistence,
and Consequences
Emergence. I earlier observed that buyers and
sellers often held asymmetric views of one anoth-

<-----Page 30----->2009

er’s trustworthiness (Table 9, column 1) and argued
that this pattern emerged from a combination of
several factors. First, both buyers and sellers had a
general distrust of other firms, heightened by their
competitive, “land-grab” industry environment.
Second, sellers expected to lose power after the
acquisitions closed, while buyers expected to gain
power. This disparity led sellers to favor the few
buyers they trusted; but buyers did not discriminate between trusted and distrusted targets.
Although these factors may partially reflect the
specific characteristics of the time period and of
acquisition transactions, there is reason to believe
that similar patterns may sometimes emerge in
other settings. Even in less intensely competitive
environments, firm leaders may be inclined to distrust most potential partners because of in-group/
out-group bias (Williams, 2007). In any transaction
involving a shift in power, the “losing” party is
likely to favor those few partners it trusts, but the
“gaining” party has no reason to reciprocate; instead, a combination of competitive dynamics and
in-group bias may lead the “gaining” party to adopt
a default position of distrust. The result is that
many transactions entail trust by one partner but
distrust by another.
The current study focused on acquisitions, yet
other transactions in which one actor voluntarily
cedes power to another may have similar asymmetries, with the actor “losing power” favoring trusted
partners while the actor “gaining power” does not.
Examples of such transactions include managers’
and union leaders’ selection of an arbitrator to resolve a labor dispute; industry leaders’ creation of a
“self-policing” or “watchdog” organization; or even
the selection of a new dean by a faculty hiring
committee. In all of these examples, both parties
begin with the ability to walk away, but after
the decision is made, one party must submit to the
power of the other. Hence, we might expect the
parties to employ differing screening criteria, leading to trust asymmetries.
The emergence of trust asymmetries need not be
limited to situations involving an impending asymmetry in power, however. Trust asymmetries may
also arise when two parties have unequal information about one another, as might be the case, for
instance, when one firm is more established and
better-known than its counterpart. More generally,
when facing any risky transaction, firms may
choose either to transact only with trusted partners,
or to exercise vigilance with whatever partner they
choose. Any occasion in which one party chooses
trust while the other chooses vigilance can create
initial trust asymmetries. Furthermore, under cer-

Graebner

465

tain conditions, trust asymmetries may persist for
some period of time.
Persistence. Prior theory has suggested that trust
imbalances will be short-lived. If one party trusts
another, the trusted party will feel obliged to reciprocate, leading to symmetric trust (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003; Zaheer & Harris, 2005). Alternately, if one party distrusts another, the
distrusted party will lose faith, leading to the development of symmetrical distrust (Ferrin, Bligh, &
Kohles, 2007). This argument requires making two
assumptions. The first is that firm X’s leaders realize they are trusted by firm Y. This assumption is
based on the belief that firm X accurately interprets
Y’s behavior—for instance, information sharing
rather than monitoring—as signaling trust rather
than distrust (Das & Teng, 1998; Ferrin et al., 2007).
The second assumption is that believing firm Y
trusts them causes firm X’s leaders to trust firm Y in
return (e.g., Ferrin et al., 2007; Johnson, Cullen,
Sakano, & Takenouchi, 1996). This relationship has
often been posited without a specific rationale (e.g.,
Das & Teng, 1998; Serva, Fuller, & Mayer, 2005).
However, one possible explanation draws upon
links between affect and trust (e.g., Dunn &
Schweitzer, 2005; McAllister, 1995). Knowing they
are trusted may lead firm leaders to experience
positive affect, which may in turn lead to trust.
Conversely, knowing that they are distrusted could
foster negative affect, leading to distrust.
The current study suggests that neither of these
two assumptions may be entirely accurate. As columns 4 and 5 of Table 9 indicate, both firms’ assessments of whether their counterparts trusted
them were frequently mistaken. This was particularly true for sellers, who often believed their buyers trusted them when the opposite was true. This
study suggests several reasons why firm leaders
may not accurately assess whether they are trusted
by their counterparts, even after observing behavior
such as information sharing or monitoring. First,
communication may hold different meanings for
the trusting and distrusting parties. The trusting
party may view social interaction and information
sharing as building trust, while the distrusting
party primarily views these activities as an opportunity for ingratiation and strategic reconnaissance.
Second, monitoring activities may be delegated
only to a few individuals within the distrusting
firm. The trusting party may attribute monitoring
behavior to the characteristics of those individuals,
rather than reassessing its views of the firm as a
whole.
Even if firm leaders accurately assess whether
they are trusted or distrusted by their counterparts,
it is not clear that this will cause leaders to change

<-----Page 31----->466

Academy of Management Journal

their own beliefs to match. As columns 6 and 7 in
Table 9 indicate, firm leaders frequently distrusted
their counterparts but felt trusted by them, or vice
versa. These mismatches occurred in either of two
scenarios. In one scenario, firm leaders trusted
their partners, but felt they were distrusted in return. This was the case for the leaders of sellers
Concept and Isle and buyer Karma. In all three
cases, firm leaders felt that they were distrusted
because of a misunderstanding or an event beyond
their control. Concept’s CEO believed his forthrightness during a breakfast meeting was misconstrued; Isle believed Harbor was wary because of a
prior deal gone bad; and Karma believed Concept
was nervous because Karma had to pull out of early
negotiations after it had itself received an acquisition offer. None of these “depersonalized” explanations for being distrusted seemed to produce negative affect or to trigger reciprocal distrust. Weber,
Malhotra, and Murnighan (2005) provided a complementary argument, suggesting that vulnerable
parties may ameliorate their anxiety through motivated cognition, in effect convincing themselves
that the more powerful party is trustworthy. As a
power-reducing transaction moves forward, the
trustor may become increasingly powerless. This
may encourage individuals to stick to their trusting
beliefs despite feeling they are distrusted in return.
In a second scenario, firm leaders distrust their
partners, but feel that they are trusted. This was the
case for buyers Ciao, Harbor, Picasso, and Checkmate. These buyers believed they were simply
more savvy than their sellers. A vice president of
Ciao (a firm that was itself still private and had not
done any prior acquisitions) compared his firm favorably to Goalie, commenting, “They actually had
a lot of naivete.” A common feature of both mismatch scenarios is that firm leaders interpreted
trust imbalances in ways that reflected positively,
or at least not negatively, on themselves. Such positive interpretation may have removed any impetus
to change their beliefs. This pattern is consistent
with other evidence that trusting (or distrusting)
beliefs are not easily altered. For example, a distrusting party that is engaging in active vigilance
and monitoring is unlikely to ever develop trust in
its counterpart (Ghoshal & Moran, 1996; Sapienza &
Korsgaard, 1996; Strickland, 1958).
Consequences. Finally, this study’s findings suggest potential consequences of trust asymmetries. I
find that trust asymmetries foster both negotiationrelated and material deception, though in somewhat different ways. Deception is only eliminated
in the condition of perceived symmetrical trust, in
which an actor both trusts and feels trusted by its

June

counterpart. Material deception only occurs in the
asymmetrical scenario in which a party distrusts
but feels trusted by its counterpart. Prior theory
suggests that if focal firm leaders believe their
counterparts are trusting, these leaders will refrain
from opportunism out of a sense of moral obligation and out of concern about potential harm to the
relationship and to the focal firm’s reputation (Larson, 1992). However, this study suggests that even
if a firm’s leaders view another party as trusting,
the leaders may feel no sense of moral obligation if
the other party is not viewed as trustworthy. Moreover, negative consequences only deter deception if
the firm’s leaders believe that the deception will be
revealed and that the deceived party cannot be
pacified through another means. For example, in
this sample buyers typically felt that negotiationrelated deception would not be revealed and that
financial incentives could counteract material deception. Because buyers did not typically trust
their sellers, they did not accept sellers’ representations that other issues were as important as financial gain. Because tendencies to deceive are greater
when the costs to others are perceived to be low
(Gneezy, 2005), this discounting of sellers’ nonfinancial motives may have further encouraged buyers’ deceit. As a result, as columns 2 and 3 of Table
9 indicate, trusted parties, particularly buyers, often engaged in deception. Furthermore, this deception often went undetected, because trusting parties did not feel the need to engage in due diligence
or other forms of vigilance.
Limitations and Future Research
As with all case study research, an important
issue is the degree to which the findings are generalizable to a broader sample. This is ultimately an
empirical question that will be answered only by
future studies. However, a variety of indicators suggest that this study’s findings may generalize to
other acquisitions. First, like the cases in this
study, the majority of U.S. mergers and acquisitions
involve privately held targets (Capron & Shen,
2007); are conducted in friendly rather than hostile
negotiating conditions (Andrade, Mitchell, & Stafford, 2001); and occur during wave periods, which
coincide with high market valuations (Maksimovic
& Phillips, 2001; Rhodes-Kropf et al., 2005). Evidence also suggests that acquisitions in the study
time frame were similar in important respects to
acquisitions that have occurred in other time periods. For example, the financial returns for most
1998 –2001 acquirers were only “trivially” different
from acquisition returns in the preceding 20 years
(Moeller, Schlingemann, & Stultz, 2005: 763).

<-----Page 32----->2009

Nevertheless, other types of acquisitions may differ in ways that influence the dynamics of trust.
The acquisitions studied here were primarily motivated by a desire to create competitive advantage
through valuable and inimitable resources. Some
acquisitions may be motivated by a transaction cost
logic, which could possibly lead to different patterns of trust and deception. In addition, these sellers were relatively high-performing firms, and so
they had the opportunity to decline buyers they did
not find attractive. In acquisitions of distressed
firms, managers may be forced to sell to acquirers
that they distrust. In addition, if a seller is a public
firm with greater exposure to shareholder lawsuits,
we might expect investors and board members to
demand that the target simply accept the highest
acquisition offer, regardless of whether firm leaders
trust the buyer. However, anecdotal evidence suggests this is not always the case. For example, litigation following the Daimler-Chrysler merger suggests that Chrysler’s investors trusted DaimlerBenz’s leaders and were angry to find that the
buyer’s informal promises were not fulfilled after
deal close.
Another factor that may lead to different patterns
of trust in acquisitions is whether buyer and seller
have prior acquisition experience. Acquisition experience could theoretically influence sellers, making them more skeptical of buyers’ promises, or
could influence buyers, either making them more
cynical and deceptive, or perhaps making them
more aware of the potential negative effects of deception. A comparison of the more and less experienced buyers and sellers in this sample did not
provide clear evidence of such patterns, but differences might be apparent in a larger sample. If a
buyer had conducted prior acquisitions, this could
also provide the seller with better information regarding the buyer’s trustworthiness in subsequent
acquisitions. However, as argued earlier, even behavior in previous acquisitions was not a particularly reliable guide to a buyer’s future actions,
given the heterogeneity of acquisition events.
A final area for future research is trust asymmetries in other types of interorganizational transactions, including strategic alliances. In prior work
the typical assumption has been that trust within
an alliance is symmetric (e.g., Dyer & Chu, 2000,
2003; Lui & Ngo, 2004; Ring & Van de Ven, 1994;
Schoorman et al., 2007; Zaheer & Harris, 2005).
However, this assumption may not always be accurate. For example, Zhang and Rajagopalan (2002)
found evidence that international joint venture
partners may differ in their abilities to exert a credible threat of retaliation for bad behavior. It seems

Graebner

467

plausible that such disparities could lead to differences in the degree to which each partner trusts its
counterpart.

Conclusion
This study’s aim was to explore issues of trust
and deception in acquisitions. In this research I
moved beyond the oft-studied setting of long-term
buyer-supplier alliances and observed how a different context—mergers and acquisitions—may influence the development of trust. In addition, this
study provides insights into trust asymmetries, an
area that several scholars have identified as a significant void in interorganizational trust theory.
I conclude with some advice for managers, particularly entrepreneurs. Smaller firms have received little attention in research on interorganizational relationships, although these firms may have
different viewpoints and face distinctive risks in
both alliances (Alvarez & Barney, 2001; Prashantham & Birkinshaw, 2008) and acquisitions (Graebner & Eisenhardt, 2004). This study suggests that
the role of seller is a difficult one, with no obvious
solution. Strategies that have been suggested as
ways to reduce deception in negotiations, such as
screening potential partners on the basis of reputation or developing a social relationship prior to
negotiating (Schweitzer, 2005), may actually increase a seller’s vulnerability. Both practices are
likely to increase a seller’s trust in a buyer, but
since trustworthiness cannot be predicted with certainty from either past behavior or social interaction, any sense of security may be false. The best
advice for sellers may be to retain their skepticism.
A leading technology investment banker, dubbed
by another informant the “king of M&A,” gave the
following words of caution:
Some buyers can put out a lot of bulls__. “We’ll
make you CEO, we’ll make you president, you’ll be
the next guy in line.” I’ve told my client, “This is
bulls__. You know this is not a commitment. I read
this guy, and he is not going to do it. If you are fine
with this, and you just want more money, that is
fine, but if you are thinking you are going to be the
CEO, don’t do it for that reason.”

Rather than relying on trust, a seller may be better
off exercising an abundance of caution. As trustworthy as a buyer may seem, a seller would be wise
to verify the buyer’s statements, ensure that important issues are resolved in written contracts, and
follow the advice of experienced attorneys. To do
any less may simply set a seller up for future
disappointment.
