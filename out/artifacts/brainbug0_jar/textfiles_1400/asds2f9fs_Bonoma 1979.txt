ABSTRACT
A theoretical connection was proposed between certain social personality variables,
namely locus of control (Internal or External) and trust (High and Low) and the formal
decision-making model of Subjective Expected Utility (SEU). Rather than adopting the
traditional definition of these variables as “generalized expectancies” for behavior of self
and others, locus of control and trust were reconceptualized as intrapersonal tendencies to
favor, prefer, or otherwise bias the subjective probabilities entering into a decision computation.
S’s high in external control orientation did not differ from internals overall, but external males were more risk averse under certain choice conditions (female-sex-role appropriate dilemma, probability-estimate form). Low-trust S’. were also more risk averse
than high-trust S’s, overall. Low-trust males generated maximally risk-averse choice solutions under the choice condition of feminine role problem appropriateness and probability
estimation. In general, female S’s made choices that were more consistent with SEUpredicted solutions than males.

INTRODUCTION
A generally overlooked but potentially interesting connection can be drawn
between some social learning correlates of personality and formal decision
models. For example, the social learning variable of locus of control (Internal/External Control [ 181) is traditionally defined as a somewhat amorphous
“generalized expectancy” which an individual holds with regard t o reinforcement. Internally oriented people are said to believe that they themselves primarily
control their decisional outcomes; externally oriented individuals, that “fate” or
“luck” largely determines their behavioral reinforcers. Consistent with this
“generalized expectancy” definition, the locus of control construct seems an excellent way in which to capture some systematic intrapersonal differences in

individuals’ decision styles. Specifically, it appears to offer an empirical measure
of an individual’s probabilistic cognitive biases about how much his or her own
actions generally modify the decision-consequence links that make up acts of
choice. While substantial work has been done using the locus of control construct
to explain variations in behavior during probability matching, level of aspiration
[20], and information-evaluation tasks [7], only a few examinations of the more
general issue of locus of control as a personality intrusion into risky or uncertain
decision making can be cited [ 151.
A similar “generalized expectancy’’ construct has been offered for the trust
(191 variable, both as it is used within and without social learning theory [8]. For
Rotter, trust is a generalized expectancy referring to how much other people’s
statements about environmental decision-consequence links can be relied upon.
Schlenker et al. [21] restrict the range of the construct t o risky situations in which
the person who trusts has something significant to lose; and Deutsch [8] provides
a means for conceptualizing trust by observing that trust most appropriately
refers to risky situations in which A’s reliance on B’s work will bring A more
harm if disconfirmed than good if confirmed.
The potential relation of these “generalized expectancies” to formal decision
models (see [ 141 for a review) becomes clearer when it is remembered that (a) such
models view much of human behavior as a “series of decisions” [6, p. 3831,
(b) the consequences of these decisions may be scaled in terms of their (subjective) worth or utility, and (c) the relation between any decision and its potential
consequences are ordinarily only probabilistic (again, subjectively) and not certain. (See [lo] or [14] for a good introduction.) In the subjective expected utility
(SEU) model, for example, a decision maker is assumed to evaluate the worths of
the various consequences associated with his decisions as well as the probabilities
of the decision-consequence links comprising the set of choice alternatives. Each
utility is weighted by its subjective probability (multiplicatively) to determine a
“subjectively expected utility’’ for that choice; the decision maker is then
assumed to act as if he were trying to maximize the net SEU available in his choice
set.
What Rotter, Deutsch, and others hypothesize about personality (i.e., crosssituation decisional consistency) when they reference what individuals “generally
expect” is translatable in decision theory terms to mean that classes of individuals
distinguished by such personality correlates may hold some subjective probability
values as more likely, favorable, or just as more frequently occurring than others
as they go about making choice decisions. That is, “expectancies” in the
cognitive sense are just probabilistic frames on one’s world. It is not
unreasonable to suggest that certain general forms of probability preference
characterize certain classes of individuals (e.g., optimists). There is evidence [91
from lottery and betting studies that such biases or preferences do occur regularly. Then, locus of control and trust can be redefined from the vantage of SEU
models by saying that these personality correlates represent a consistent tendency
of individuals to “bias” or “distort” the subjectively generated probabilities
they compute as the link between their decisions and hoped-for or feared

consequences in some characteristic manner. If this general rationale is correct,
such consistent biases would generate reliable differences in decision-making
tasks similar to those which appear in information, persuasion [17],or even social
protest studies [ 1 I].
Bonoma and Schlenker have recently [2] [3] 141 reported some studies on
decision making in general and the SEU hedonic calculus in particular which offer both a novel methodology and some unusual findings within which to make
some test of the general reasoning offered above. Instead of having S’s make
choices and then reasoning backward to probability and utility scalings, the investigators first preexperimentally trained s’s on probability and utility scales (31.
S’s were then presented with several hypothetical decision dilemmas modified
from the Kogan-Wallach Choice Dilemmas instrument [ 131. These dilemmas
were quantified on the predefined experimental scales so that only one numerical
decision component was missing. S’s were asked to intuitively supply that missing
(numerical) value so that the value of the uncertain alternative would be “just
greater” than that of the certain choice.
In three different experiments [4]involving over 200 S’s and including one
complete replication study, several findings were stable. The first was that,
generally, both male and female S’s chose missing decisional parameters in an
SEU-consistent, defined as “rational,” fashion in accord with the task directions, even though they were naive about decision theory and probability theory,
and even though problems were presented strongly as a matter of opinion, not as
one of computation or fact.
The second major result, and the one we further pursue in this paper, concerns the conditions in which “rational” solutions were not provided by s’s. The
major finding has been a sex by form-of-Opinion-Questionnaire interaction on
Ss’ deviations from the “rational” value postexperimentally computed for each
problem using an SEU model. Only the males who responded to feminine-roleappropriate problems’ requiring a probability-response-format (Form PF)
generated reliably “irrational” (i.e., risk-averse) values on the decisional dilemmas; the “irrationality” was three times as large in magnitude as any other experimental mean. This unusual pattern was found in all three experiments.
Though Bonoma and Schlenker were able to speculate on it [4], they were not
able to explain it.
Fortunately, both locus of control and trust data had been collected from S’s
as an ancillary experimental exercise-it turns out these data are important in explaining Ss’ decision making as the present study will show.

’The sex-role treatment was included because initial experiments [4. Experiments 1 and 111 showed
that male and female subjects showed no sex differences when responding to decision dilemmas in
which the central actor was represented only as male. The absence of differences was so disparate with
the main body of conflict literature that a female-appropriate problem set was constructed to pursue
the sex variable along sex role. rather than phenotypic, lines.

THEORETICAL RATIONALE AND HYPOTHESES
Locus of Control

The reconceptualization of the social personality variables of locus of control and trust offered above suggests that these constructs may be profitably
viewed within a theoretical decision perspective as representing a kind of intrapersonally held, cognitively consistent “frame” or bias for subjective probability
generation. An internal locus of control subject, for example, is presumed to
generally believe in the power of his own acts in producing consequences, and
therefore to bias or characteristically “set” probabilistic decisional components
differently from a subject who displays a predominately external locus of control
orientation. The theoretical reconceptualization does not suggest, however, just
how a given level of locus of control, or of trust, should affect decisional logic,
either alone or in concert with each other. The personality literature, fortunately,
offers some hints.
Regarding locus of control, the following pattern emerges. Internals (1’s)
have been found to prefer intermediate or “safe” bets as opposed to risky ones in
gambling tasks [MI, to take longer to make more difficult as opposed to more
simple decisions [ 121, to use previously provided information more completely in
evaluating another person [17], and also to seek out available choice information
more fully before making a decision (71. Conversely, S’s characterized as high in
external (E’s) locus-of-control orientation prefer risky bets, do not vary decision
time with decision complexity, and neither seek out fully nor use well available
decision information before providing a choice evaluation. It would seem the I’s,
consistent with their desire to believe that they, and not fate or luck, control their
outcomes, have a frame or tendency to set their subjective decisional parameters
in close correspondence with the external decisional information provided. E’s,
however, believing traditionally that luck or fate will control the decisional consequences anyway, tend to pay less attention to the external decisional components.
If the 1’s are called “accuracy” decision makers, the E’s may be called “sloppy”
decision makers.
Thus, the findings and rationale of locus of control overall seem to suggest
that 1’s are more careful decision makers, and are more information- and
evaluation-oriented; therefore, perhaps 1’s would be more “rational” (i.e., SEUconsistent) decision makers generally due to a bias to have subjectively generated
probabilities be highly consistent with provided objective decisional indices or
choice information. In the Opinion Questionnaire methodology (explained more
fully in the methods section), which asks S’s to select a missing subjective probability (or utility) so that one decisional alternative is “just greater” than another
in subjective satisfaction, we hypothesize that I’s, as opposed to E’s, should appear to generate decisional solutions generally more consistent with SEU-dictated
solutions, which demands close attention to all decisional parameters for successful computation. Further, given that probability-estimate response formats and female-sex-role problem sets have been previously found to be most

<-----Page 4----->19791

43

disruptive (that is, not consistent with SEU-dictated solutions) to rational decision making for male S’s, male 1’s should evidence less deviance from SEUdictated “rational” solutions to the dilemmas than male E’s. Formally,
1.

1’s should generate decisional solutions reliably more SEU-consistent than
E’s.

2.

When confronted with decisional formats which have been previously found
to produce risk aversion in choice, 1’s should be less affected by these disturbances than E’s. Since these conditions have affected only males reponding
to probability-estimate, female-role-appropriate problems, male E’s (but not
male 1’s) should generate solutions highly inconsistent with SEU-predicted
values to the decision dilemmas under these conditions.

’

Trust

The theoretical translation for trust is not so easily made. While the locus of
control variable is easily seen as a generalizable frame on all decisional tasks, the
trust variable has been traditionally associated only with an individual’s behavior
in interaction or interpersonal settings. It is not unreasonable to suggest,
however, that whatever decisional biases are interpersonally revealed by
high (Hi)- versus low (Lo)-trust S’s may be part of a more general “style” of
decision making. Deutsch presents an important clue to such a general style when
he notes that trust is the expectation of the occurrence of an event, where the “expectation leads to behavior which [the actor] perceives to have greater negative
motivational consequence if the expectation is not confirmed than positive
motivational consequence if confirmed” [8, p. 2661. Put bluntly, Deutsch argues
that high-trust individuals are poor bettors in the sense that they tend to make
bets with a clear margin of negative to positive SEU’s because they
characteristically bias the subjective probabilities associated with success upwards. If such a bias exists and is generalizable beyond just interpersonal relations, we would expect high-trust individuals to be less “rational” in their solutions to decisional dilemmas than low-trust S’s. Also, Hi’s should make more irrational decisions in those decisional format or context conditions found to cause
deviations from “rational” solutions previously. Low-trust individuals, contrarily, should generally tend toward SEU-consistent, “rational” problem solutions
because they lack such a general bias. Thus,

3.

Lo’s will be more “rational” in decision solutions to the dilemmas than Hi’s
when an SEU-dictated solution is used as the comparison for “rationality.”

4.

Hi’s should evidence the most deviance from SEU-dictated “rational” solutions in decisional contexts previously found t o generate risk-averse choices.

‘Note that the previously found choice-disturbance conditions are just those involving subjective
probability estimation; the theoretical basis for the personality variables are reported herein.

<-----Page 5----->DECISION SCIENCES

44

[Vol. 10

Since these choice-disturbing contexts have affected only male S’s previously, male Hi’s should generate the most risk-averse decisional solutions under
these contexts.
If locus of control and trust represent two different sorts of “frames” on
decisional computation, one might ask about their joint presence and interaction
in the same individual. Does a Hi-trust, I-oriented S make decisions differently
than a Hi-trust, E-oriented S? Theoretically, it would seem as if trust and locus of
control may be related and may even be somewhat exclusive. That is, an “accuracy bias” (1 orientation) does not seem to be compatible with a “poor betting” (High trust) bias within the same individual; the two operate at crosspurposes. This is tantamount to saying that a correlation may exist between locus
of control and trust levels-1’s should be generally low in trust levels, and E’s
high. The present study confined itself to assessing the presence or absence of
such a general correlation without specifically investigating the various combinations of locus of control and trust possible for each S.

METHOD
Design
Male and female S’s responded to seven different decisional dilemmas (two
times for each dilemma in a different item order) on one of four forms of the
Opinion Questionnaire. These forms were male-sex-role appropriate, probability
estimate (Form P); male-sex-role appropriate, utility estimate (Form U); femalesex-role appropriate, probability estimate (Form PF); and female-sex-role appropriate, utility estimate (Form UF), as explained below. S’s were divided (see
below) into Hi and Lo trust, and Internal versus External locus-of-control orientation. Their total mean deviations (SEUo) from SEU-dictated “rational” decision solutions were analyzed separately for locus of control and trust. The design,
then, was a 2 (sex) by 4 (form) by 2 (trust) analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the
trust variable, and a similar three-way ANOVA for the locus of control variable.
Additionally, a Pearson correlation ratio was computed on the relationship between locus of control and trust scores in the sample.
Subjects
Fifty males and fifty-three females were recruited for the experiment from
the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle, campus. The subjects were all
undergraduate introductory psychology students participating in the experiment
for course credits. Nine S’s were deleted from the design, seven for failing to
show up for the second administration of the questionnaire and two for failing to

understand the experimental instructions as measured by a quiz.3 The total n for
analysis was ninety-four; deletions were approximately equal over cells.
Questionnaire Construction

The Opinion Questionnaire method is more fully described in [3] and [4].
Briefly, the original “English language’’ paragraphs for seven of Kogan and
Wallach’s [13] Choice Dilemmas were presented to S’s and supplemented with a
“Gain-Loss Summary Statement” which quantified the probabilities and utilities
associated with each decision alternative available to the central actor.
In the Opinion Questionnaire, an actor is faced with a choice between a certain, but only moderately profitable, alternative and an uncertain, but potentially
greatly profitable (or costly), alternative. The task is to provide the minimum
probability (utility) for success of the uncertain alternative before the S , taking
the place of the central actor completely,‘ would adopt the latter over the former.
As previously discussed, Forms P and P F asked for probabilities while
Forms U and UF asked for utilities or “satisfaction units” (SU’s) in the decision
estimate. The response scale for the former ranged from 0-10 chances in ten steps
of one chance; for the latter, from 0-100 SU’s in steps of ten SU’s. Forms P and
U used “Mr.” A, B, “him,” “his,” etc., as the male-sex-role appropriate phrasing, while Forms P F and UF used “Ms.”A, B, “her,” etc., as the female-sexrole appropriate phrasing. The decisional parameters provided by the investigators (i.e., the utlities and odds for the certain alternative plus all
parameters except for the one uncertain choice) were defined on common scales
and were systematically varied over problems [4]. A sample situation from the
Opinion Questionnaire phrased in male-appropriate, probability-estimate (Form
P) format may be found in the Appendix.
The major dependent variable was a derived measure, SEUD (deviations
from the SEU of the certain alternative from the uncertain alternative on each
dilemma). Essentially, the experimenters entered Ss’ decisional (probability or
utility) choices into the SEU equation to get an SEU for the uncertain alternative,
compared this with the value generated from the SEU computation for the certain
alternative, and recorded the direction and degree of deviation of the first from
the second. All computations occurred postexperimentally and were performed
’S’s were given a preexperimental demographic questionnaire and instructional quiz which assessed
(a) their naivete regarding decision theory, formal mathematical training, and probability theory, as
well as (b) seven items testing their comprehension of the relatively complex instructions and scales.
On the demographics, the only difference was a sex difference. with males (F=4.0, p < .05) reporting
slightly more mathematical training than females. The two S’s deleted from the design both made
more than three errors on the instructional quiz; the remaining S’s averaged 0.9 errors. with no
reliable differences over cells.

‘The original Kogan-Wallach procedure has S’s udvise the central actor only-a more “active” roleplaying [16] procedure was adopted because of its ability to generate decisions similar to those of
“real” decisional contexts [22].

by the investigators; S’s made no computations other than supplying a missing
value. A risky choice is indicated by a negative (-) value; a conservative one
(conservative in this sense has defined as risk aversion, as opposed to the other
possible definition-the avoidance of using extreme values of subjective probabilities) by a positive ( + ) value.
After responding to the second administration of the Opinion Questionnaire, all s’s completed Rotter’s [18] Locus on Control Scale as well as Rotter’s
[19] Trust Scale under the titles “Preference Scale” and “General Opinion
Survey,” respectively. The range of scores on the Locus of Control Scale was
2-18. A median split was used to classify S’s. S’s in the 2-10 range were classified
as 1’s (n =44);S’s in the 11-18 range were classified as E’s (n = 50). S’s did not differ reliably in their assignment to cells of the design by 1/E classification
(Xz<1.3); cell size ranged from 11-13.
For the trust variable, the range generated was 44-82. Again a median split
was used to classify the S’s. S’s scoring from 44-66 were termed low trust; there
were 47 Lo’s. S’s scoring from 67-82 were classified as Hi’s, and there were 47
such S’s. No reliable classification differences (X2
< 1) were uncovered by cells of
the design; cell size ranged from 10-14.
The two separate administrations of the instrument to all subjects were used
to generate a test-retest reliability coefficient. The Pearson correlation between
the grand mean of a given S’s “deviations from rationality” from seven different
decisional dilemmas completed in the first administration, and the same grand
mean from the second administration (three-week interval), was computed and
equalled .78 (p< .001). An analysis of variance was calculated using the sequence
of administrations as an independent variable. When no significant differences
between administrations were discovered, the scores from all fourteen decisional
dilemmas were collapsed into one total mean deviation (SEUD) for each S. The
total mean of S’s SEUo scores generated from the two administrations of the
seven decisional dilemmas was entered into the 2 (sex) x 4 (form) unweighted
means ANOVA for the I/E and trust classifications, respectively.
‘Among the other excellent recommendations of an anonymous reviewer was the suggestion that we
submit the data collected to a multiple regression analysis. This was done, with only those variables
significant in the ANOVA analyses being entered to predict SEUD. The model constructed was of the
form
SEUD=a+ b,SEX+ b,FORM+ b,I/E+ b,TRUST+ b,SEXx GROUP+e.
The R*of the regression attained only a value of .18. with a standard error of 13.4 units. The only
significant effects obtained among the regressed variables were the Trust variable (.05) and the Sex x
Group (.05) factor.
The results diverge from the ANOVA analyses below. Since the ANOVA analytic technique is a
special case of the general linear model represented by a regression technique (ANOVA uses noncontinuous treatment variables only), the results cunnot be different unless there is curvilinearity in the
data set such that overall correlative estimates are nullified by reversals at various treatment levels.
This indication of curvilinearity in (at least) the S’s trust and I/E classification scores led to the
separate computation of correlation coefficients on those scores below; the hypothesis of curvilinearity is indicated by those analyses.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Correlation Between 1/E and Trust

To provide a rough preliminary check on our reasoning about the possible
interactions between locus of control and trust scores, a correlation coefficient
was computed between these two indices for each S. The theoretical rationale dictates that a reliable coefficient should obtain since (for example) high levels of
trust and high I orientation are inconsistent in a decision theory translation. The
correlation between the trust and 1/E measures overall was only + .16, which was
not reliable. There was some suggestion of curvilinearity in the data (see footnote
5 ) , so the Pearson r was computed separately for 1’s and E’s over trust levels. For
the I’s, the correlation was -.22 (pC.06); for the E’s, the correlation was .25
(p c .04).Thus, the correlational data support the theoretical rationale that for 1’s
trust is negatively correlated with increasing externality and that for E’s trust and
externality are positively related.
The overall correlation between trust and the grand mean of deviations from
“rationality” (SEUD) was .07 (nonsignificant); the overall correlation between
locus of control and SEUDscores was .28 (p c .05).
Locus of Control
Table 1 presents the results of the ANOVA including locus of control, sex,
and form of questionnaire, and three significant ( p c .05) effects and one
marginally significant ( p c .06) effect are evident. The first is a sex main effect,
with males (X=1.6) reporting reliably more risk averse mean SEUDvalues than

females (X=0.2). Hence, sex of S had some reliable effects on decision making
independent of other variables, as has been found in past research [13]. Sex effects, however, were generally modulated differentially over form and internaVexterna1 classifications, as summarized below.
The interaction between sex of subject and form of questionnaire reached a
reliable level (p < .05). Female subjects making decisions under questionnaire
Form P (male-sex-role appropriate, probability-estimate format) were more risk
averse (x=5.52) than males (x=3.15) responding to Form P, while males
responding to Form P F (female-sex-role appropriate, probability-estimate format) were significantly more risk averse
17.32) in their decision making than
females
2.15) under the same conditions. Thus, the sex of subject by formof-questionnaire interaction appears t o be caused by subjects required to make
decisions of a probability response format under the opposite sex role. These
decisions turn out considerably more risk averse than other decisions.
The two-way interaction between form of questionnaire and locus of control
was only marginally significant (p< .06) and explicable by one simple effect-E’s
responding under questionnaire Form P F (female-sex-role appropriate,
2.4) in their SEUD comprobability-estimate format) were more risk averse
putations than were 1’s (x=O.9),
(F=4.3, df = 1 and 78, p < .05). The previous
findings of Bonoma and Schlenker [4], then, would primarily seem to have been
due to the behavior of E’s, not the 1’s. No other comparisons in the interaction
between form of questionnaire and locus of control were reliable (p’s > .lo).
The three-way interaction of locus of control, sex, and form of questionnaire, which was highly significant (p< .Ol), is depicted in Figures 1A and 1B. Inspection of the figures clearly shows two conditions under which strong choice
“irrationality” (evidenced as risk aversion) was generated. Of the I-oriented S’s,
males under the Form P condition (x=16.0) were significantly the most risk
averse; of the E-oriented S’s, males under the Form P F (x=32.4) were
significantly the most risk averse. These conditions were not equally disturbing to
choice “rationality” for all subgroups of S’s, however. First, for female S’s, the
SEUD scores were not significantly different from SEU-predicted scores under
either of the male-disturbing questionnaire forms. Second, not all of the males’
scores were significantly different. I-oriented males responded somewhat
(x=8.7), but not reliably, more deviantly to the PF questionnaire than either
(both F’s<2.0, d f = 1 and 78). The only
female 1’s ( x = 2 . 2 ) or E’s (x=8.1),
subsets of S’s for which there were reliable choice deviations are the I-oriented
males under Form P ( p < .05) and the E-oriented males under Form PF (p < .01).
The E-oriented males are the most risk averse of all subsets of S’s: when tested
against I males (p< .Ol), I females (p< .Ol), or E females (p< .Ol), and against
the grand mean of all other cells (p < .02). The I-oriented males are significantly
risk averse only under Form P. Overall, I-oriented males are not significantly
more risk averse than other subsets of S’s. N o other comparisons in Figures 1A
and 1B were significant; all possible comparisons were made (p’s > .15).
Thus, Hypothesis 1, which stated that 1’s should be more “rational” decision makers than E’s (a) overall and (b) under the choice-disturbing conditions

(Form PF), was only partially confirmed for a subset of these S’s. 1’s were not
generally reliably less deviant from SEU-consistent decision solutions than E’s
(no locus-of-control main effect); they were so only under the female-sex-role appropriate, probability-estimation conditions which had been found to generate
risk-averse choices earlier by Bonoma and Schlenker [4]. The three-way interaction of locus of control, sex, and form further clarified this pattern; it was not all
S’s who were risk averse under the P F questionnaire form-rather, only male
subjects high in external-control orientation were reliably deviant from SEUdictated “rational” values.
These results are reassuring in the sense that they add some additional weight
to the earlier assertion [2] [3] [4] that S’s respond generally in a manner consistent
with (or not reliably different from) SEU-dictated solutions in some decisionmaking tasks like the Opinion Questionnaire. Even the “choice disturbance”
conditions coupled with a probability-estimation response format with femalesex-role appropriate wording is not disturbing for either I or E females or for I
males. Rather, only the E males were reliably risk averse, even under these
“disturbing” conditions.
These results are perplexing because it is not readily apparent why this
subgroup of male, E-oriented S’s was so radically deviant from their fellows. Certainly, it is easy to argue that males [2], being unused to responding as if they
were female actors, might generate extremely conservative SEUo’s because of an
“irrational” stereotype of females or sheer inexperience with responding in a
female-role set. But why under probability-estimation conditions alone? Why
only the E-oriented Ss? And, why males but not females?
If we return to the original theoretical link between locus of control and decision logic, some speculative yet plausible answers arise to each question. Regarding why the effect occurs in the probability-estimate, but not utility-estimate conditions, it can be recalled that locus-of-control orientation, as a generalized expectancy or probability, was assumed to characteristically bias the way in which
S’s generated, evaluated, or preferred the probability components associated with
their decision ratiocinations. This effect should be more pronounced when probabilities, as opposed to utilities, are estimated, since it was only in the probabilityestimate forms that the subjective probability component was left unspecified in
the task set for S’s (i.e., they supplied it) and hence open to bias by S’s. If this
argument carries force, we should look for a similar “biasing” trend in the other
probability-estimate form of the Opinion Questionnaire, Form P. Referring to
Figures 1A and lB, it can be seen that a nonsignificant reversal of the malefemale differences occurred for external-control s’s. That is, under maleappropriate wording, the female E’s were in fact more “irrational” or risk averse
7.0) than their male
-2.9) counterparts. This is exactly the finding to be
expected if locus of control, as a “probability” frame, has more direct effects on
those questionnaire forms where this parameter is free to vary and not specified
by the task.
Turning to the second problem, why only the E-control males evidenced “irrationality” or risk aversion, we again appeal to the theoretical link between

locus of control and choice decisions. E’s,it will be remembered, traditionally are
supposed to have a generalized espectancy that their decision-consequence links
are more characterized by “outside” environmental influences than by processes
internal to them. Working from a general cultural sex-role stereotype (e.g., [5])
which characterizes females as rather plodding, conservative, and affect-ridden
“irrational” decision makers, it is possible to suggest that the E’s were simply
following the task instructions very well and modeling as accurately as possible
their understanding of the role to be assumed. I’s, on the other hand, because of
their general expectancy that internal (self) factors influence their decision processes, might have been either less willing or less able to adopt this conventional
stereotype completely, since they tend to view their decision tasks frum the set
which claims that they (and not any provided values) primarily determine their
decision estimates. Thus, it could be argued that E’s may be better at role playing,
at “externalizing” than 1’s; male E’s displayed the extreme risk aversion they
both conventionally expected and also found comfortable with their general decision styles. It must be noted that this interpretation is consistent with the “accuracy bias” for 1’s hypothesized in the introduction. If 1’s are indeed more
assiduous at processing decisional information generally, why then did they not
process the sex-role context and produce more risk-averse responses than E’s? An
alternative, of course, is that 1 and E males just have different understandings of
how females would make decisions, the former attributing much selfdetermination and the latter much control by luck or chance to feminine decision
styles. The present data do not permit any differentiation of these possible explanations.
On the third question, why only males displayed (significant) I vs. E differences, there appears to be a plausible cultural explanation for &hestrength of
the effect with male, as opposed to female, S’s. In current society. it seems probable that females must become adept at performing decision tasks competently
under both male-role-appropriate (because of male dominance in task setting)
and female-role-appropriate conditions. The same adaptability might not hold
true for males, who because of privileged position do not ordinarily encounter
female-role-appropriate tasks. Hence, all other things equal, we would expect the
males responding under female-role sets to display more disturbance from unfamiliarity than would females responding under male-role sets, and this
hypothesis generally corresponds to the pattern of obtained differences (Figures
IA and 1B).
Parenthetically, one fact which stands out from Figures 1A and lB, as well
as from the sex main effect, is that females were generally more “rational” (i.e.,
SEU-consistent) decision makers than males, a finding which takes one more
brick from the stereotype of the irrational decision styles of the “weaker sex.”
Trust

exactly approached the SEU-consistent rationality value of zero SEUDover all

all items than females.
The interaction of trust with form was reliable (p < .02), and is depicted in
Figure 2. As the figure shows, the difference between the high- and low-trust S’s

was only in the choice-disturbance conditions identified by Bonoma and
relevant,
Schlenker and found in the I/E analysis above-female-role
probability-estimate response conditions. The high-trust versus low-trust comparison was reliable for this condition by simple effects test (F= 5.93, p < .03); no
other comparison reached reliable levels.
Thus, Hypothesis 4 was also confirmed by these data; under conditions of
“choice disturbance,” high- as opposed to low-trust S’s display reliably more
choice “irrationality,” in this case, risk aversion. The general pattern of these
findings is the same as that disclosed for the locus-of-control analyses, with the
exception that in no way were the trust findings differentiable in regard to sex of
S’s. The findings, rather, seem equally strong whether males or females are the
decision makers.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
The obtained findings generate as many questions as they do conclusions.
Some of the more interesting ones are overviewed here.

2.

The most important conclusion to be drawn is that locus of control and trust
as “social” personality variables have some kind of theoretical relationship
to the formal decision-making models. There appears to be some heuristic
value in viewing these personality variables as probabilistic “styles.”
“frames,” or other intraindividualistic and consistent ways of interpreting,
generating, and evaluating the subjective probabilities associated with
decision-consequence links (see [23] for some theoretical suggestions about a
similar mechanism). Extreme values of I/E control and trust are associated
with reliable biases of decision reasoning: locus of control in a rather complex manner as it interacts with questionnaire form and sex of S’s, and trust
somewhat more straightforwardly as well as in interaction with questionnaire form. There may be some clear benefits in attempting to reconceptualize other personality variables (e.g., extroversion-introversion or other
Jungian types [I]) in expectancy terms, and hence promoting personality
constructs toward decision theoretic relevance.
The data obtained in this study at least make somewhat more plausible a
theoretical answer to why probablity response formats (especially when
phrased in female-sex-role-appropriate manners) generate a set of situational
decision variables which “disturb” otherwise “rational” and SEUconsistent decision making. Apparently, S’s extreme on the social personality constructs of I/E control and trust may tend to reliably bias, distort, or
otherwise preferentially set the subjective probability components entering
into their decision reasoning differently from their fellows.’ The parameters

‘Strictly, it is only the theoretical link posed in the introduction, and not the data, which argues for
this interpretation.Since utilities were varied experimentally as well, we cannot assert empirically that
the obtained effects were solely due to “probability distortions.”

of such differences are clearer; E-oriented males, and high-trust S’s, display
these “disturbances to rationality” maximally. Most important, of course, is
why choice-disturbance conditions exist so reliably and whether they
generalize beyond the present methodology or are just an idiosyncracy of the
Opinion Questionnaire task. Some evidence exists indicating that
generalizability of role-playing tasks like the Opinion Questionnaire is quite
high [la]. If this general assertion turns out to be confirmed for our specific
methodology, then it is extremely important to identify exactly which other
variables, besides I/E and trust, effect choice disturbances.
On sex and sex role, a distorted variant of the nature-nurture question, the
results clearly indicate that both factors, alone and interactively, affect
choice logic. Females, over all conditions, tended to be more “rational”
decision makers than males; however, it is clear that this overall finding was
due to the extreme choice conservatism generated by PF males (E’s only). An
interesting point is that there are some choice situations which certain S’s
(e.g., males) with unique (e.g., E-oriented) personality patterns just “cannot
handle,’’ or alternatively, certain situations which the SEU model cannot
predict.
Finally, the Opinion Questionnaire methodology seems to offer a good tool
for investigating individual as well as social psychological influences on decision making. It is especially valuable if the investigator is not especially interested in “traditional” decision making concerns, such as choice transitivity or utility scaling, but rather wants to treat such variances as “noise” in
order to focus on the reasoning process itself.

APPENDIX
A Sample Opinion Questionnaire Problem
Form P-SITUATION 7
Mr. G , a married 30-year-old research physicist, has been given a five-year appointment by a major university laboratory. As he contemplates the next five years, he realizes
that he might work on a difficult, long-term problem which, if a solution could be found,
would resolve basic scientific issues in the field and bring high scientific honors. If no solution were found, however, Mr. G would have little t o show for his five years in the
laboratory, and this would make it hard for him t o get a good j o b afterwards. On the other
hand, he could, as most of his professional associates were doing, work on a series of shortterm problems where solutions would be easier t o find, but where the problems are of lesser
scientific importance.
