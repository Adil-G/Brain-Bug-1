Analyzing the Use of Informationin Investment
Decision Making: A Methodological Proposal

I.

INTRODUCTION

Foresightful investment analysts have long recognized the need to understand more clearly the detailed processes underlying investment
decisions-especially decisions made by acknowledged experts. For
example, Bernhard observes that, if the mental processes of consistently
successful investors are intuitional, that intuitional reasoning must be
made understandable.' In a similar vein, others have argued that, by
compelling the investment analyst to translate his vague attitudes, opinions, and reasons into explicit quantities, the analyst's thoughts are
brought out into the open where they can be observed, evaluated, and
tested.2

Researchers in the areas of economics, finance, and psychology
have recently taken up the challenge of simulating and describing the
judgment process. There are, at present, a number of methods that
should be of interest to persons concerned with the dynamics of investment decisions. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to this work and to present an experiment that illustrates the
use of one such method for quantitatively describing the use of information in investment decisions. Due to limitations of the sample of
subjects and the particular cases being judged, the reader should view
the experiment as a methodological illustration-not a finished empirical
investigation.

making has been carried out by Clarkson, who undertook to simulate

the portfolio-selection processes of a bank's trust-investment officer.3
Clarkson collected a large number of protocols based on the verbalized
reflections of the investment officer who was asked to "think aloud"
while reviewing past and present decisions. Using these protocols as a
guide, the investment process was translated into a sequentially branching computer program. When the validity of the model was tested by
comparing its selections with actual portfolios selected by the trust officer, the correspondence between actual and simulated portfolios was
found to be remarkably high.4
B. Linear Models
Clarkson's work shows that, given patient and intelligent effort, many
of the expert's cognitions can be distilled into a form capable of being
simulated by a computer. However, this paper will emphasize yet another approach-one that attempts to provide less of a sequential analysis and more of a quantified descriptive summary of the way that a
decision maker weighs and combines information from diverse sources.
This approach aims to develop a mathematical model of the decision
maker and requires less time and effort on the part of investigator, subject, and computer. It forms a nice compromise between the complex
"computer model" of Clarkson and the relatively naive approaches of
the precomputer era-such as simply asking the decision maker how he
makes his judgments. The philosophy and techniques for developing
such mathematical models are discussed in considerable detail by psychologists Hoffman, Hammond, and Goldberg.=>
The basic approach requires the decision maker to make quantitative evaluations of a fairly large number of cases, each of which is
defined by a number of quantified cue dimensions or characteristics.
A financial analyst, for example, could be asked to predict the long-term
price appreciation for each of fifty securities, the securities being defined
in terms of cue factors such as their price-earnings (P/E) ratios,

corporate-earnings growth trend, dividend yield, etc. Just as investigators interested in modeling the characteristics of the market have
suggested using multiple correlational procedures to capture the way
in which the market weights and responds to these factors, Hoffman,
Hammond, and others would suggest fitting a regression equation to the
analyst's judgments to capture his personal weighting policy. The resultant equation would be:
A

Jpa=a+blXl

+b2X2?..

+bkXk,

(1)

where Jpa= predicted judgment of price appreciation; X1, X2 . . . Xk
are the quantitative values of the defining cue factors (i.e., P/E ratios,
earnings, etc.); and bi, b2 . . . bk are the weights given to the various
factors in order to maximize the multiple correlation between the predicted judgments and the actual judgments. These weights are assumed
to reflect the relative importance of the factors for the analyst. Equation
1 is known as the linear model.
Psychologists have found linear models to be remarkably successful
in their ability to predict judgments of such diverse criteria as psychiatric
diagnosis, malignancy of ulcers, job performance, and the riskiness and
attractiveness of gambles.6 Political scientists have found linear models
useful for describing judicial decision processes in workmen's compensation and civil liberties court cases.7 Researchers interested in simulating financial and managerial decisions have independently discovered
the value of linear models. For example, Bowman and Kunreuther successfully fit linear models to decisions concerned with production scheduling, and Hester used regression analysis to develop a "loan offer
function" representative of the lending policy of a particular bank.8

C. Configural Models
When an analyst associates good investment decisions with complex and
interrelated decision rules, chances are that he envisages types of patterned or configural relationships rather than the linear combination
rule discussed above. Configurality means that the analyst's interpretation of an item of information varies, depending upon the nature of
other available information. An example of configural reasoning involving price changes, volume, and market cycle is given by Loeb:
"Outstanding strength or weakness can have precisely opposite meanings at different times in the market cycle. For example, consistent
strength and volume in a particular issue, occurring after a long general
decline, will usually turn out to be an extremely bullish indication....
On the other hand, after an extensive advance which finally spreads to
issues neglected all through the bull market, belated individual strength
and activity not only are likely to be shortlived but may actually suggest
the end of the general recovery.9'
Such introspective reports indicate that analysts believe that factors
relevant to investment decisions should often be interpreted configurally.
Therefore, it is important that techniques used to describe judgment be
sensitive to such processes. The linear model can be made sensitive to
configural effects by incorporating cross-product terms into the policy
equation of the judge. When models become this complex, however,
the proliferation of terms in the equations becomes so great that proper
estimation of the weights for the configural and nonconfigural terms
can be difficult. For this reason, some investigators have turned to a
related model, that of the analysis of variance (ANOVA), to describe
complex judgment processes.
III.

THE

ANOVA

MODEL10

The structural model underlying ANOVA is quite similar to that of
multiple regression. However, the ANOVA model typically imposes two
important restrictions on the factors that describe the cases being judged:
(a) the levels of the factors must be categorical (e.g., good vs. average
vs. poor; up vs. down, etc.) rather than continuous variables;1" and
(b) the factors must be orthogonal (uncorrelated); in other words, if
P/E ratio and dividend yield are two factors, they should be uncorrelated across the set of stocks. In return for these restrictions, the
ANOVA model efficiently sorts the information about linear and configural judgment processes into nonoverlapping and meaningful portions.
9. G. Loeb, Thle Battle for Ini estmnent Surviv al (New York: Simon &
Schuster, 1965), p. 65.
10. The description of the analysis-of-variance model and techniques can
only be given minimal coverage here. For more details, the reader should consult
a standard textbook of statistics.
11. These categories could have more descriptive labels, however. For
example, P/E ratio could be categorized as below 10, between 10 and 20, and
above 20.

For illustrative purposes, consider the situation in which an analyst
is asked to judge the potential price appreciation of several securities
on the basis of just two factors, support trend of prices and marketvolume trend, each of which could be either up (+) or down (-) for
a given stock. Imagine also that the judgments are made on a rating
scale varying from 1 (very little potential) to 9 (very great potential).
The ANOVA model, applied to this situation, would assert that:
Jijk -

M + ao +

P3k +

yjk +

eijk,

where JiJk is the analyst's rating of the ith stock, a stock that was observed to be in condition (level) j with respect to support trend, and
condition k with respect to volume trend; M is the mean of the ratings
over all the stocks, regardless of their level of support and volume; aj
is the main effect of support trend; ,83kis the main effect of volume trend;
yjk is the interaction effect created by combining support and volume
over and above any effects associated with these factors considered
separately; and eiik is a random error component.
The main effects, aj and Pk, are defined as follows: aj
-Mj-M,
and ,1 = Mk - M, where Mj and Mk are the mean ratings of all stocks
having level j, with respect to support trend, and level k, with respect
to volume trend, respectively. Finally, yjk, the interaction effect, is defined as:
'Yjk

Mk

-

M

-

aj - 1k=

Mk

-

M-Mk

+ M,

where Mik is the mean rating for all stocks jointly having level j of
support and level k of volume.
To further illustrate the meaning of main effects and interactions
and their relationship to the interpretation and use of information, consider the following example. Suppose that the mean rating given to a
number of stocks varies with support and volume as indicated in figure
1. Here, we see that the ratings vary systematically with changes in support (aj # 0) but are not influenced by changes in volume (Pk
0).
This systematic variation with support is called the main effect of support.12 When a factor has a statistically significant main effect, we shall
12. We have been treating the cell entries in fig. 1 as mean judgments.
There will typically be variability around these means. This "within-cell" variability is usually regarded as sampling error. It is important to estimate whether an
apparent effect is, or is not, due to error before deciding that something systematic
is actually occurring. The analysis of variance is well known for its ability to test
whether an effect is greater than could be attributed to error. If it is, we say that
the effect is "statistically significant." If a factor has n levels where n > 2, its
main effect can be partitioned into a linear trend component and curvilinear
components up to degree n - 1. Thus, a significant linear trend in the main
effect of factor X would indicate that the best fitting polynomial equation to
predict the judgments should include a linear function of X. If a significant
quadratic trend appears in the main effect of factor X, an X2 term should be
added to the equation, etc. For further discussion of this point see W. G. Cochran
and G. M. Cox, Experimitental Designs (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1957),
pp. 335-75.

the levels of a factor and the overall mean, M, the greater the influence
of that factor upon the judgments.
Sometimes two or more factors might each produce significant
main effects. An example is shown in figure 2. Here, the mean judgment
for each of the four cells equals an additive combination of the effects
of the individual factors. That is, stocks that are characterized by a
favorable level for both factors receive a higher mean rating than do
stocks for which only one factor is favorable. When factors have an

judged has to meet a certain minimum standard on all factors before
it can receive a high evaluation.
Although the introspections of experts concerning the manner in
which they make judgments are replete with statements about their
dependence upon patterns or configurations, there have been few attempts to demonstrate such complex processes empirically. The ANOVA
technique is important because, by isolating the effects of interactions
from those of main effects, it makes the empirical description of configural judgments feasible.
IV.

AN

EXPERIMENT

ILLUSTRATING
THE
ANOVA
TECHNIQUE

A. Subjects
The subjects were thirteen stock brokers and five students. The students
were working toward an M.B.A. and were about to complete a graduate
course in investment analysis. Nine of the brokers came from three
brokerage firms located on the West Coast. The remaining four brokers
came from one firm located in Chicago. On the average, the brokers
had about four and one-half years of experience. Their median length
of experience was two years, and the range was six months to fifteen
years.
B. Procedure
To apply ANOVA to the study of investment decisions, one first selects a set of presumably relevant factors (i.e., items of information
or dimensions along which a stock can be described) and then constructs hypothetical stocks such that specific combinations of these
factors are represented. Judgments are made by the subjects about each
of these stocks, and these are analyzed by means of an ANOVA model.
Main effects and interactions are calculated and tested for statistical
significance.
In the present study, common stocks were described by means
of eight factors commonly provided in Standard & Poor's Standard
Listed Stock Reports. Each factor could take one of two levels. The
factors, with their abbreviations and levels in parentheses, were:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)
g)
h)

Industry (IND-Stable vs. Dynamic);
Resistance Level (RES-Up vs. Down);
Support Level (SUPP-Up vs. Down);
Volume Trend (VOL-Up vs. Down);
Near-Term Prospects (NTP-Good vs. Poor);
Profit-Margin Trend (PMT-Up vs. Down);
P/E Ratio Comparison (PER-Good vs. Poor); and
Earnings per Share Yearly Trend (EYT-Up vs. Down).

Next, hypothetical stocks were constructed by combining levels

<-----Page 9----->291

Information in Investment Decision Making

of these eight dichotomous factors so that pairs of factors were uncorrelated across the total set. This property is desirable if the independent
influence of each factor is to be estimated with minimal ambiguity. One
way to insure such independence would have been to construct all
combinations of factors (28, or 256 stocks in this case). Doing so
would have permitted an analysis of all main effects and interactions
among any combination of the eight factors. However, for purposes
of saving time and effort on the part of the subjects, a smaller number
of companies was employed. If one is willing to forego the ability to
study higher-order interactions (i.e., interactions involving a large number of variables) and to assume that their influence would be negligible,
it is possible, by means of a fractional replication design, to evaluate
the main effects and lower-order interactions with a considerably reduced number of stimuli. For the present study, a 4 fractional replication of a 28 factorial ANOVA design was used to guide the manner in
which the hypothetical companies were constructed.15 This produced a
set of sixty-four stocks. This reduction of stimulus companies from 256
to sixty-four resulted in the confounding of main effects and two-way
interactions with certain of the higher-order interactions. Other higherorder interactions served to estimate the error term in the ANOVA.
Thus, if configural use of three of more factors did occur, the error
term would have been inflated.
Figure 4 illustrates the way in which information about a company was displayed to the subjects. The sixty-four stocks were preceded
by eight practice stocks and were bound in a notebook. The subjects
worked on the judgments in their leisure time. They were not told that
the companies were hypothetical. They reported that the task was extremely interesting and several noted that they were able to conjure up
images of companies as they read the information about the stocks.
The average amount of time spent in evaluating the companies was
two and one-half hours. The range was between one and five hours.
The testing was done during the months of March and April of 1969.
The subjects were instructed as follows:
Your task as an account executive is to evaluate each firm with regard
to its potential capital appreciation,with a time horizon of six to eighteen
months. Your judgmentwill be on a scale from 1 to 9, with 1 representing
an expectationof a substantialdecrease in the value of the stock, 5 meaning
you expect no significantchange, and 9 being an expectationof a substantial
increase in value. You are free to use these numbers and the numbers in
between them in any way that you wish to express gradationsin your expectation about a stock.
Each company's stock should be judged with regard to its possible
inclusion into a customer's portfolio. As you make each judgment, keep
in mind that the client is a middle-aged businessman,40 to 45 years old,
whose current portfolio is valued at $10,000. During the period of time
15. For details of how to construct such fractional replication designs, see
Cochran and Cox (n. 12 above), pp. 244-92.

when the information about the companies was compiled, the stock market

was expected to move up very gradually,with no wide fluctuationsin either
direction.
There is a set of 8 "practice" companies to familiarize you with the
factors and rating scale. It is not expected that you will complete your
evaluations in one sitting, and it may be helpful to review your judgment
levels on the "practice" companies before each sitting, to ensure consistent
evaluations for the total group of companies.
It is important that you maintain a consistent frame of reference and
"style of judgment" throughout the study. Therefore, please don't discuss
the study or the way you are making your judgments with anyone else
until after you have finished.

C. Results
How did the subjects evaluate stocks on the basis of the eight factors?
Upon completing his ratings, one broker gave this description of his
approach.

<-----Page 11----->293

Information in Investment Decision Making

I looked first at Industry to determine the possible range of price
swing and then used Near TermProspectsalong with PIE Ratio Comparison
to determinethe play the P/E would have in price action. After a decision
was made here, I combined Profit Margin Trend and Earnings per Share
Trend to get a feeling for the impact earnings direction would have on
price. Then I would combine judgments of PIE Ratio and Earnings per
Share to decide the fundamentalcondition of the company, and I applied
my judgmentof the company'sfundamentalcondition to the three technical
factors. I would then arriveat a decision regardingprice movement.
This rather vague verbal description is typical of the way that
expertise is usually communicated. It would be difficult for another
broker, a student, or an investor to gain much insight into this broker's
use of information on the basis of such a report. It is because of the
inadequacies of such reports that more precise, quantitative descriptions
are valuable.
To illustrate the sorts of analyses that can be performed on these
data, we shall consider, in detail, the judgments of brokers 2 and 10.
There was rather poor agreement between these two brokers' ratings
of the same stock. The correlation between their judgments, across the
sixty-four cases, was only .26. Our analyses will attempt to make the
sources of this disagreement explicit.
In order to measure the influence of the various factors, an
ANOVA was performed on each broker's responses. Sums of squares
and mean squares were computed for each of the eight main effects
(individual factors), each of the two-way interactions, and certain threeway interactions that could be estimated with this particular factorial
combination of stocks. In addition, two indices of the importance of a
factor or interaction were computed for each effect. One was simply
the standard calculation of the magnitude of an effect, based upon the
degree to which the mean judgment shifted as the levels of a factor
varied. The second index, called C&, is a function of the squared magnitudes of effect and provides an estimate of the proportion of the total
variance in a subject's judgments that could be attributed to a particular main effect or interaction.16
Tables 1 and 2 present the results of the analyses for the two
brokers. The ratings of broker 2 changed significantly with variation
in the levels of each of three factors. The most influential factor was
Earnings Yearly Trend, with Support Level a close second and Resistance Level third. No interactions were significant. Summing the co2
indexes for these statistically significant effects, it appears that about
50 percent of the variance in this broker's responses could be accounted
for on the basis of these three main effects. In this analysis, there is no
way to determine whether the remaining variance is due to unreliability
(error) in the judgments or to higher-order interactions.
16. The rationale and computing formulas for the co2 index are presented
in W. L. Hays, Statistics for Psychologists (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston,
1963), pp. 381-82, 406-7.

Broker 10 exhibited six significant main effects, the strongest of
which were due to changes in Near-Term Prospects, Earnings Yearly
Trend, Profit-Margin Trend, and P/E Ratio. In addition, seven interactions were significant. Thus, broker 10 was influenced by more (and
different) factors than was broker 2 and interpreted them in more configural ways. A polynomial equation appropriately weighting single
factors (main effects) and cross-product terms (interactions) would
account for 83 per cent of the variance in the ratings of this broker.17
Even though broker 10, with seven significant interactions, was
processing information in a highly configural manner, most of the systematic variance in his judgments could be accounted for (predicted)
by means of an additive combination of main effects. The configural
processes of the other seventeen subjects accounted for even less variance. On the average, main effects accounted for about 75 per cent of
the variance in each subject's ratings, while interactions contributed only
4 per cent. The negligible contribution of interactions is a typical finding
in other types of judgmental studies and testifies to the remarkable ability
of main effects to predict judgments generated by configural processes.
Thus, fairly simple models can often do an excellent job of simulating
configural thought processes.18
The finding of a significant main effect or interaction is only a first
step in understanding how a judge uses information. It should be followed by an examination of the relevant mean ratings, graphical representation of the effects, and interrogation of the judge concerning the
rationale behind his behavior in order to further understand the effect.
To illustrate, the significant interaction between the effects of Industry
and Near-Term Prospects for broker 10 is pictured graphically in figure 5. The figure shows that a dynamic industry increases this broker's
estimate of a stock's potential when the company's near-term prospects
are good but decreases its attractiveness slightly when prospects are poor.
An index of the overall importance of a given factor was calculated by summing the magnitude of the main effect of that factor with
the magnitudes of all significant interaction effects containing that factor. The summed effect of a given factor was divided by the sum of
the effects of all factors. This index of importance was thus a percentage
score where the sum of all percentages totaled 100. Table 3 illustrates
the calculation of this index for broker 10.
17. The equation of the judge should, ideally, be cross-validated against
a new sample of this judge's predictions. When this is done, one would expect
some shrinkage in the percentage of variance that the equation could predict.
However, previous studies of judgment models have found the degree of shrinkage
in such new samples to be tolerably small. See, e.g., N. Wiggins and P. J. Hoffman,
"Three Models of Clinical Judgment," Journal of Abniormlal Psyclhology 73 (February 1968): 70-77.

This index was used to compare all thirteen brokers and five students with one another. The results, presented in the upper half of table 4, indicated that: (a) there were substantial individual differences
in the use of the various factors; (b) both brokers and students relied
most heavily on Earnings Yearly Trend; however, the students focused
on this variable to a greater extent than did the brokers; (c) brokers
exhibited more disagreement with one another than did students;
(d) technical indicators (Resistance, Support, and Volume) and NearTerm Prospects were used more by brokers than by students; the latter
relied more heavily on Earnings Yearly Trend, P/E Ratio, and ProfitMargin Trend.
The greater agreement among students and their tendency to rely
less on technical market indicators is undoubtedly due to the fact that
they were just completing the same course from the same instructor on
the topic of security analysis. In contrast, the brokers had more varied
kinds of training and experience.
How closely would the judges' subjective impressions of the relative importance of the eight factors conform to the index of importance
calculated from the ANOVA model? To answer this question, each
subject was asked, after completing his ratings, to distribute 100 points
over the eight factors proportionally to his feelings about their importance in determining his judgments. These distributions are presented

in the lower half of table 4. They indicate that: (a) subjective weightings were even more variable, across individuals, than were the computed effects; each factor was seen as most important by at least one
judge; (b) the brokers' subjective weights did not relate closely to their
calculated effects (the correlation between subjective and computed
effects, across brokers, was only .34) ;19 although Earnings Yearly Trend
had the highest mean subjective and computed weights, the subjective
importance attributed to Industry was consistently overestimated; also,
Volume was perceived as more important than Resistance and Support,
a fact that was not confirmed by the calculated effects; (c) students'
subjective weights were considerably more accurate (their correlation
with computed effects was .79), but they, too, overestimated the effects
of Industry and Volume.
The finding that students' subjective weights were more similar
to their computed effects than were the subjective impressions of the
brokers prompted an examination of the relationship between number
of years experience as a broker and accuracy of self-insight. Insight
was measured by correlating a broker's subjective weights with his
calculated effects across the eight factors. It was hypothesized that,
since students were most insightful, the brokers' insight might decrease
with increasing experience. Across the thirteen brokers, the Spearman
rank correlation between the insight index and experience was -.43,
which is in the direction specified by the hypothesis.
Why should greater experience lead to less valid self-insight? Perhaps the recent classroom and examination experiences of the students
and young brokers necessitated an explicit awareness of the mechanics
of the skill that they were attempting to learn. With increasing experience, skilled behaviors become more automatic and require much less
attention. Because of this, they may also be harder to describe. The
question is an intriguing one and needs to be investigated with more
precision than was done here. It may be that the most experienced analysts produce verbal rationales for their evaluations that are less trustworthy than those of their inexperienced colleagues.
D. Criticisms of the Experiment
When questioned about the task, several brokers felt that the factors
and their levels were not descriptive enough. They would have preferred
judging companies for which charts of support, resistance, and volume
trends were given along with actual numbers representing the levels
of profit margins, P/E ratios, etc. They also requested some information about current price and trading range of the stock. Still others felt
that the type of client should have varied from one stock to another.
The suggestions for more descriptive information could readily be ac19. It is possible that the brokers were estimating subjective main effects
only and that a new index that omitted the calculated effects of interactions would
produce significantly higher correlations between subjective and computed importance. This hypothesis was tested and was not substantiated.

commodated within the restrictions of the ANOVA technique, and
variation of the type of investor, as one of the cue factors, would lead
to an interesting study of the manner in which the use of information
changed from one type of client to the next.

CONCLUDING

REMARKS

The principal results of the illustrative study, namely, that strong individual differences in linear and configural use of information exist, can
be made explicit, and can be contrasted with subjective perceptions,
should be viewed as preliminary until further studies are completed.
These studies should use more sophisticated analysts as subjects and
more realistic cases as stimuli. Stimulus cases can be made more realistic,
as noted above, by allowing factors to take more than two levels and
by defining those levels in more descriptive terms. However, studies
should also be done in which analysts judge real companies. Here, one
does not have precise control over the distributions and interrelations
of factors, and these factors will undoubtedly be correlated across a set
of companies. In these studies, multiple regression rather than ANOVA
should be used as the data-analysis model and it may not be possible
to estimate configural effects with precision. However, it should be possible to make many of the same types of comparisons, using main effects,
as were made above in the illustrative study.20
The results of the present study suggest that techniques such as
ANOVA and multiple regression,have considerable promise as devices
for describing and furthering our understanding of the use of information in investment decisions. These techniques are likely to provide
experts with new insight into their inferential processes. Furthermore,
they might also be valuable teaching devices that would enable students
to see exactly how their own processes differ from those of experts or
optimal models.
One additional and rather remarkable benefit from quantitative
analyses of judgment bears mentioning. Studies by Bowman, Kunreuther,
and Goldberg have shown that, although mathematical models based
on such analyses may not be optimal, the consistent application of these
models often leads to decisions that are superior to those of the individuals who are being modeled.21 This arises from the fact that humans
tend to be erratic in their judgments, thus generating error that reduces
their accuracy. The model filters out this error and is, therefore, able
to outperform the decision maker whose judgments it was designed to
simulate. The exciting implications of this discovery remain to be
exploited.

companies, see Hoffman (n. 5 above), and Hammond, Hursch, and Todd (n. 5
