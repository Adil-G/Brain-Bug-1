Summary--Given the vast amount of codeable information in marital interactons, observational coding
systems must emphasize particular classes of behavior. The most widely used marital coding scheme, the
Marital Interaction Coding System (M ICS), like many older 'behavioral' coding systems, emphasizes verbal
content over affect. Changes made to the MICS between versions Ill and IV are described; they were
intended to increase the system's use of coded affect and to decrease autodependence in sequential analysis.
We used an archival data set of 994 couples' videotaped conflict negotiations coded with the MICS. As
intended, the MICS-IV, relative to the MICS-Ill, was found to have the advantage of capturing more
non-verbal affect expressed during marital interactions, which resulted in stronger interactional
contingencies (e.g. Wife Blame--*Husband Blame, Husband Facilitation ~Wife Facilitation). The M ICS-IV
also yielded significantly lower levels of spurious autodependence.

COMPARISON

The behavioral study of marriage began with an emphasis on overt, observable behavior. The
development of sophisticated, reliable and valid observational coding systems (e.g. Marital
Interaction Coding System [MICS], Hops Wills, Weiss & Patterson, 1972; Couples Interaction
Scoring System, Notarius, Markman & Gottman, 1983) resulted in a large body of research
delineating the behavioral differences between distressed and non-distressed couples. Distressed
couples, compared with non-distressed couples, were found to behave less positively, more
negatively, and were more likely to reciprocate negativity (see Schaap, 1984; Weiss & Heyman, i 990
for detailed reviews). Cognitive-behavioral psychologists (e.g. Baucom, Fincham) then began
broadening the behavioral focus to include inferential and/or non-observable variables (such as
emotion and cognition), while also making extensive use of observational coding systems.
Observational coding systems are important to the psychological study of marriage because they
generate much of what we know about marital functioning. Unfortunately, published studies using
observational coding systems rarely go beyond reporting reliability and, occasionally, validity data.
Furthermore, when such systems are revised, research consumers often do not know what changes
have been made. Changes to a coding system may affect mean scores for coding categories (e.g. base
rate data) and, of special importance for sequential analyses, the strength of both between- and
within-person contingencies. If scholars expect to wrest meaning from the conflicting results of
observational research (of Weiss & Heyman, 1990), more detailed information must be disseminated.
Coding systems are designed to record behaviors of interest, and it is natural that they evolve over
time as research questions evolve. For example, the MICS began as a behavioral coding system;
decision rules stipulated that if behaviors were multiply coded, as would be the case when some
affective expression occurs simultaneously with a discrete verbal behavior (e.g. a problem description
made with a hostile voice tone), only the verbal behavioral code should be retained (Weiss &
Summers, 1983). Relegating affect to a lower status is inconsistent with the now-established empirical
evidence that affective elements of communication are more highly related to marital quality than
actual verbal content (e.g. Gottman, 1979; Gottman, Markman & N otarius, 1977; Hahlweg, Reisner,
Kohli, Vollmer, Schindler & Revenstorf, 1984; Vivian & O'Leary, 1987). In response, MICS decision

rules were revamped to capture greater affective nuance* and codes were added to tap important
inferential constructs (e.g. withdrawal, dysphoric affect).
This paper has two aims. First, we wished to present the first published description of changes from
MICS-III to MICS-IV. We hope this will make it easier for consumers of MICS research to
comprehend the current system. Second, we wanted to test several specific hypotheses regarding the
differences between two versions of the MICS. To make these hypotheses more comprehensible, we
first will describe the changes made to the MICS.

Differences between MICS-III and M I C S - I V
The development, history and use of the MICS-III are described in detail by Weiss and Summers
(1983)Weiss & Summers (1983)t. The MICS-III comprised 30 codes organized into seven a priori
behavioral categories: blame (e.g. put down, criticize); invalidation (e.g. disagree, deny
responsibility); problem description; proposals for change; facilitation (e.g. paraphrase/reflect,
humor); validation (agree, approve); and irrelevant (e.g. unintelligible or off-topic talk). Non-verbal
affect codes (e.g. negative voice tone, smile) could be double-coded with behaviors. However, these
codes were not used for sequential analyses. State codes (attention, not-tracking) denoted listener
eye-contact; these codes were used for sequential analysis only if the listener did not emit any codeable
behavior. Microbehaviors are assigned an a priori categories, such as blame and validation, and base
rates and sequential statistics are typically reported for categories, not specific codes. Codes,
categories, and changes between MICS-III and MICS-IV are summarized in Table 1, and will be
discussed below.
New coding categories. Spurred by Gottman and Krokoff's (1989) combination of several
MICS-III codes into a 'withdrawal' category, we set out to use behavioral analytic techniques to
construct a new MICS code for withdrawal. As described in detail elsewhere (Heyman, Weiss & Eddy,
1990), we had spouses review their videotaped conflict and indicate when they thought the husband
was withdrawing. These withdrawal 'windows' were then examined and the withdrawal code was
formulated and taught to MICS coders.
We found no single marker of withdrawal that was necessary and sufficient to define the behavior.
Thus, coders are asked to use a gestalt of behavioral cues (i.e. no response to partner; turn offcues
such as rolling eyes, which precede withdrawal episodes; closed-off body language; no eye contact
or 'glazed' eye contact; muscular rigidity and tenseness; decreases in baseline levels of body
movements) to judge if the spouse is withdrawing. Withdrawal is coded as long as it occurs (e.g. a
*Although radical behaviorists would rightly maintain that all is behavior (especially when discussing an obserrationalcoding
system), the common but artificial distinction of 'behavior" (observable motor actions and verbal content) and "affect"
(observable facial and bodily movements which are interpreted as displays of emotion), will be maintained throughout
the paper.
t A comprehensive table of studies using the MICS studies since 1983 is available from the authors. Couples from Follette
and Alexander (1992) were excluded because it was a dating sample.

listener who withdraws during five different speaker statements will receive five different withdrawal
codes). Despite the high degree of inference necessary, coders can reliably discriminate withdrawal.
Furthermore, their coding significantly corresponds with couples' own coding of withdrawal
(Heyman & Weiss, 1989).
As mentioned earlier, marital research during the 1980s included an increased focus on affect.
Accordingly, we included a code for dysphoric affect. Early studies of the marriages of depressed
women indicated that depressive behaviors of depressed/maritally distressed women suppressed
blame responses from their spouses (Biglan, Hops, Sherman, Friedman, Arthur & Osteen, 1985) and
children (Hops, Biglan, Sherman, Arthur, Friedman & Osteen, 1987) at significantly greater rates
than depressed/non-maritally distressed and non-depressed/non-maritally distressed wives.
Furthermore, there is good reason to believe that the 'negative' affects of anger and dysphoria are
theoretically and functionally separate (Biglan, Lewin & Hops, 1990). In adding a dysphoric affect
code (which includes complaints about the self, whining, crying and sad affect), we borrowed heavily
from the code used in earlier studies of depression in marriage, the LIFE coding system (Hops, Biglan,
Arthur, Warner, Holcomb, Sherman, Oostenink, Osteen & Tolman, 1988).

Restructuring the MICS coding unit
Typical representations of marital interactions either ignore listener behaviors or create an artificial
speaker-listener-speaker-listener alternation that destroys the actual sequence of the behaviors by
treating concurrent behaviors as if they were consequent behaviors. Weiss and Summers (1983)
argued that for a marital coding system to be truly systemic, both partners should be coded
continuously. Dual-stream coding (see Fig. 1) allows researchers to examine both the internal
determinants (autodependence) and social determinants (cross-lags) of behavior (Jones & Gerard,
1967; see also Warner, 1992).
Dyadic Behavior Units (DBUs) are the atomic unit for the MICS. As shown in Fig. I, each DBU
contains one husband behavior and one wife behavior. The rules for forming the DBUs in the
MICS-III were as follows:
(1)each DBU contains both a husband and wife code describing concurrent behavior
homogeneous in content;
(2) only behavior and [attention] codes are used;
(3) behavior codes take precedence over [attention] codes ([attention] codes are used only when
no concurrent behavior code is listed); and
(4) a new DBU is created whenever one partner's behavior changes. The fourth rule allows either
speaker or listener behavior to provide new inputs into the couples' system (Weiss & Summers, 1983,
p. 109).
Although the fourth rule derived from the systemic intentions of Weiss and colleagues, it is
inappropriate for use in sequential analysis when the units of analysis are transitions between
individual behaviors (e.g. H:Withdrawal--,W:Blame), rather than transitions between DBUs (e.g.
H:Withdrawal/W:Blame~H:Attention/W:Blame), are the unit of analysis. This proposition will
now be explained in detail.
Coders are instructed to begin a new DBU when (a) a new speaker gains the floor or (b) when
the speaker begins a new thought. Thus, it is the speaker who drives the creation of DBUs. However,
this produces coding problems. To illustrate, according to rule 4, ifa husband makes a compromise
and the wife assents twice, two DBUs are created when the data are prepared for sequential analysis:
the husband is recorded as compromising and then compromising again, with the wife assenting each

<-----Page 3----->R i c h a r d E. H e y m a n et al.

740

time. Thus, it appears as if the husband proposed a further compromise in response to the wife's
assent, which did not occur. This is problematic for two reasons. First, it increases the
autodependence between behaviors by artificially creating 'sequences' out of single occurrences.
Second, it violates the most basic assumption made in sequential analysis, the assumption of sampling
independence (¢fBakeman & Dorval, 1989), because in this case no code but compromise can form
the second DBU.
Fortunately, the flaw in the MICS-III DBU formation is easily solved. If one reformulates rule
4 by using the same rules used during coding (a new DBU is created whenever a new speaker gains
the floor or when the speaker begins a new thought) and by adopting a one-code-per-original-unit
rule for both the speaker and the listener, the DBU formation rules becomes both theoretically and
statistically sound.
A second major change in DBU formation was made to increase the amount of affect captured
during sequential analysis. MICS-III rule 2 states that only behavior and attention codes are used
in DBUs (i.e. affect codes were discarded). Because affect codes typically carry the most important
message in a DBU--for example, a husband describes a problem while rolling his eyes--they should
not be summarily dismissed. MICS-IV uses a hierarchy of codes (see Table 2). For each DBU with
double or triple codes, the code with the highest position in the hierarchy is retained and the rest
are discarded. Thus codes with the highest a priori importance have the best chance of being kept,

whereas less important codes are more likely to be rejected from sequential analysis. As described
above, a wide array of studies have demonstrated the primacy of affective expression (and especially
negative affect) in influencing marital communication. The a priori system currently in use (Table 2)
was arranged in declining order of importance of code clusters; these clusters have received empirical
support from factor analyses of the MICS (Heyman, Eddy & Weiss, 1995; Jacob & Krahn, 1987).
The most highly negative codes (put down, criticize, mindread negative and turn off) were placed
highest, followed by expressions of dysphoric affect (complain and cry), mildly negative codes
(off-topic, deny responsibility, excuse, disagree, non-comply), constructive problem discussion codes
(positive physical touch, humor, smile/laugh, mindread positive, disapprove, approve, paraphrase/
reflect, accept responsibility, positive solution, negative solution, compromise, agree), neutral
problem discussion codes (interrupt, comply, assent, problem description, command, normative,
question, unintelligible talk), and listening states (attention and not-tracking). It should be
emphasized that these were our a priori groupings, and that they are user modifiable.
Aims q[" study
We were interested in testing if the changes to the MICS DBU rules had substantial effects for
two reasons. First, did our modifications have the desired effect of reducing spurious
autodependence? Once corrected, are cross-lag contingencies (i.e. H--*W and W--*H sequences)
stronger than auto-lag contingencies? For example, are husbands' behaviors more strongly a product
of responding to their wives' behaviors (as behavioral studies traditionally have assumed), or can
husbands' behavior be more simply attributed to their own behavioral consistency?
Second, did the changes to the MICS increase its sensitivity to affect (i.e. higher base rates of
affectively laden categories and stronger cross-lag contingencies on these categories)? Specifically, we
hypothesized that the base rates in the blame category (which includes turn-off, a code comprising
hostile voice tone and facial expressions) and facilitation (which includes three codes that were
dropped under MICS-III rules, question, smile/laugh and positive touch) would be significantly
higher under MICS-IV rules than MICS-III. Because of the hypothesized shifting of DBUs to more
affective-laden categories, categories that are exclusively behavior-based (description, propose
change, validation and invalidation) may have significantly higher base rates under MICS-III rules.
METHOD

Subjects
All marital conflict negotiations coded at the Oregon Marital Studies Program, University of
Oregon, between 1987 and 1991 were archived (N = 994 couples). If more than one problem
discussion was coded, only the first discussion was used for this study. This archival sample comprised
data from 14 marital studies laboratories. The exact recruitment strategy and special sample
characteristics differed depending on the intent of the particular study. Most studies included both
distressed and non-distressed couples, and most used volunteer subjects (as opposed to a random
sample).
Ns are provided because not all demographic information could be obtained from the participating
laboratories. Length of marriage was M = 9.73 years, (SD = 8.27, N = 391). Men's mean age was
34.04 years (SD = 10.16, N = 569) and women's was 32.43 years (SD = 9.34, N = 569). Couples had
a mean of 2.36 children (SD = !.48) and a mean family income of $31,045.39 (SD = 16,619.32,
N = 160). Some studies used the Marital Adjustment Test (Locke & Wallace, 1959) and some studies
used the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier, 1976). DAS scores were converted into MAT scores
using the formulas provided by Crane, Allgood, Larson and Griffin (1990). Men's mean MAT score
was 106.02 (SD : 21.8, N = 438) and women's was 106.61 (SD = 20.14, N = 437).
Procedure
The standard marital interaction paradigm involves generating a list of conflictual areas for a
couple, and asking them to discuss the problem for 10-15 min and try to reach a solution. Couples
typically rate these interactions as quite naturalistic (e.g. Margolin, John & Gleberman, 1988).

Sessions were videotaped, and tapes were shipped to the University of Oregon. Tapes were scored
by trained undergraduate coders using the MICS, under the supervision of RLW. Sessions were
coded under an agreement with investigators that an agreement criterion of 70% with a master coder
would be used. Any sessions that fell below this criterion were recoded; any coder who regularly fell
below 70% agreement was put into a retraining module. Approximately 300-400 sessions were coded
by two independent coders, with acceptable levels of reliability. In an earlier generalizability study,
Wieder and Weiss (1980) reported that disagreements among MICS coders were not a significant
source of variance. Cohen's kappas are not available for the entire database. However, several
investigators calculated kappas for their studies and reported them; the average kappas were as
follows: Gottman and Krokoff (1989), x > 0.72; Gottman and Levenson (1992) x > 0.60; Heyman
et al., (1990) x > 0.70. It was not feasible to calculate kappa-by-code for a system of over 30 codes.
We generated base rate and sequential indices for each couple (i.e. not aggregated across couples)
from the original protocols using the MICS-III and MICS-IV rules. Because some tapes were coded
with MICS-III and some with MICS-IV, codes and code categories added to the MICS-IV were
excluded from these analyses. We chose kappa (Wampold, 1989) as our lag-sequential statistic.
Kappa (a non-parametric test statistic) is similar to the more widely employed z-score (a parametric
statistic), but it is preferable because it is not influenced by the total number of codes in the interaction
sequence (Wampold, 1989). The length of the sequence is especially a concern when a large,
heterogeneous sample is used. To facilitate more stable sequential statistics, kappas were calculated
only when the category frequency exceeded four.
RESULTS
Base rate results for MICS categories are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Because MICS-III rules
(Weiss & Summers, 1983) emphasized behavior and excluded concurrent affect, we hypothesized that
MICS-III would capture lower levels of positive and negative affect. This was confirmed (i.e. in
Tables 3 and 4, MICS-IV had significantly higher levels of Blame and Facilitation). Categories that
contain mostly content-based behavior codes had higher levels with the MICS-III rules (i.e.
Invalidation, Validation, Propose Change, Irrelevant and Problem Description). Also as
hypothesized, nearly all MICS categories displayed significantly less autodependence in MICS-IV
than MICS-III (see Tables 5 and 6).

Finally, as predicted, sequences involving reciprocity of affect (i.e. Blame and Facilitation) showed

DISCUSSION

Using the population of studies coded over a five-year period, several hypotheses concerning the
third and fourth editions of the Marital Interaction Coding System were supported. First, the
MICS-IV, relative to the MICS-III, captures more non-verbal affect expressed during marital
interactions. That is, MICS-IV's hierarchy rules for creating sequences result in more strong negative
(i.e. blame) and more subtle positive (i.e. facilitation) codes. MICS-IV rules also result in less
behavior-laden negative (i.e. invalidation), positive (i.e. validation and propose change) and neutral
(i.e. problem description and irrelevant) codes. Because strong negative affect is considered to be the
most important phenomenon in marital communication (e.g. Gottman, 1990; Notarius & Markman,
1989), this finding is an important one.
Second, we found that several important interactional sequences between spouses (e.g.
Blame ~ Blame, Facilitation--* Facilitation) result in stronger contingencies using the M ICS-IV rules
rather than MICS-III. Thus, both base rate and sequential findings have been sharpened by adopting
rules that recognize the primacy of affective communication. The major implication for observational
researchers is that a study's results depend not only on the obvious variables of codes, coders and
observed behavior, but also on the manner in which the codes are transformed into sequences.
Because a result can be considered important or worthless depending on whether it is statistically
significant, the significant rule-based differences found here can have quite important implications
for what MICS-IV studies 'find'. This point holds true not only for MICS studies, but all
observational studies, because all observational systems must operationalize which elements of
observed behavior (including affective behavior) are considered important.
Third, internal determinants of behavior (i.e. autodependence) have been virtually ignored in the
marital interaction area. Allison and Liker (1982), in their widely cited paper on lag sequential
analysis, argued that researchers should correct for autodepedence. However, no marital studies
using lag-sequential analysis have accounted for autodepedence. The present study provides both

positive findings and a stark warning concerning autodependence. Beneficially, MICS-IV rules
generate significantly lower levels ofautodependence than MICS-III. In other words, using MICS-IV
to structure sequential data leads to lower contingencies between one spouse's behavior and his/her
same subsequent behavior, due to the modification of MICS-III rules that mandated autodependence
in certain situations.
However, autodepedence may still be a substantial problem. Because the MICS is coded in parallel
streams (see Fig. 1), it provides the opportunity to compare the relative strengths of auto- and
cross-lags. Most categories in the MICS do show significant autodependence (i.e, auto-lag kappas
at lag- 1 are significantly different from 0) but because of the high power due to large sample size,
unimportant relations can be statistically significant. However, the magnitude of the auto-lag
sequences was equivalent to, and sometimes greater than, the corresponding cross-lags. This opens
the possibility that some cross-lag effects previously reported in the literature may be due more to
intra-spouse responding (i.e. either self-stimulation or responses that last longer than one coding unit)
than to inter-spouse responding.
This finding should not be a great surprise to communication researchers. Although the null
hypotheses in sequential analysis assume that all behaviors emitted are truly random, it has been
known for some time that communication is highly patterned (see Gottman, 1979, for a review).
Marital researchers have mostly examined cross-lag contingencies, but significant patterning is also
evident within spouses. This patterning is probably due to three factors. First, by coding at the level
of the thought, the MICS often codes a monologue as multiple DBUs. Thus, it becomes quite easy
for a speaker (and for the listener) to continue to behave similarly unit after unit. Second, internal
determinants of behavioral consistency are phenomena to be explained in their own right and not
necessarily treated as nuisance variables to be partialled. That each spouse behaves in a predictable,
patterned manner is what makes communication possible. Finally, previously identified phenomena
such as negative reciprocity (e.g. Margolin & Wampold, 1981) may result in consistent (and therefore
autodependent) levels of affect. Thus, affective responding to negative partner behavior may result
in significant cross- and auto-lag contingencies.
For this final reason, simply partialling autodependence as a nuisance variable (e.g. Allison &
Liker, 1982) may result in overly conservative estimates of the social determinants of behavior.
Nevertheless, marital researchers must be wary of interpreting cross-lag effects (typically the only
form of sequential analysis in marital studies) without also examining the auto-lag effects.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, marital adjustment data were not available

on a couple-by-couple basis; thus, the results are based on all couples coded, rather than separate
analyses for distressed a n d non-distressed couples. A l t h o u g h the n o r m s presented here are helpful,
a replication that includes separate tables for distressed a n d non-distressed couples would be useful.
D e m o g r a p h i c variables were also n o t available on a couple-by-couple basis, thus precluding analyses
by variables such as age or income. T h u s we c a n n o t say that these results apply to all couples or across
all d e v e l o p m e n t a l time points; however, the heterogeneity a n d size of our sample argues for it
represents those couples typically studied in marital oberservational research. Again, extensions of
this research including such variables would be informative. Finally, the results are based on a single
10-rain interaction. A l t h o u g h some data exists to s u p p o r t the stability of results based on such
o b s e r v a t i o n s (Wieder & Weiss, 1980), this issue has not been exhaustively studied. Sequential
statistics, because they are often based on small frequencies per cell, are more vulnerable to short
observational segments t h a n base rates. A large scale replication of this study that also examined
the stability of both base rates a n d sequences could address this concern.
In conclusion, this study provided a guide to and test of the changes the system has u n d e r g o n e
since then. G i v e n the often confusing (Weiss & H e y m a n , 1990) body of literature that marital
o b s e r v a t i o n research has produced, we hope that this empirical test of the effects of the changes to
the M I C S will aid in the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of new study findings and provide some context when those
findings differ from the extant research.
