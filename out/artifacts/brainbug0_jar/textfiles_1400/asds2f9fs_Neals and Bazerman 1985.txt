THE EFFECTS OF FRAMING
AND NEGOTIATOR OVERCONFIDENCE
ON BARGAINING BEHAVIORS AND OUTCOMES
MARGARET A. NEALE

Two systematic biases-the framing of conflict and negotiator overconfidence-are suggested as possible influences on negotiator behaviors.
To investigate these biases, 100 subjects were asked to negotiate a fiveissue contract under controlled conditions. Results indicated that (1) a
positive frame led to more concessionary behaviors and successfill performances than a negative frame and (2) realistically confident subjects
exhibited more concessionary behaviors and successful performances
than subjects who were overconfident. Implications of the results of this
study for third-party intervention and the training of negotiators are
discussed.

The negotiation literature has strived to identify elements of the bargaining situation that enhance the resolution of conflict (Kochan, 1980). Routinely,
it has focused on negotiator differences (Rubin & Brown, 1975), third party
impasse procedures (Grigsby & Bigoness, 1982; Kochan, 1980; Kochan &
Baderschneider, 1978; Rubin, 1980), or various normative models that predict
negotiator behavior (Fisher & Ury, 1981; Nash, 1950; Raiffa, 1982). The literature has not, however, specified the ways in which negotiators deviate from
rationality and actually make decisions within the bargaining context. The
purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of systematic biases on the
negotiation process.
FRAMING AND OVERCONFIDENCE BIASES
Since March and Simon's (1958) delineation of the concept of bounded
rationality, specifying human judgment as deviating from rationality in predictable ways, researchers have made considerable efforts to identify the
decisional heuristics inherent in human decision making (cf., Pitts & Sachs,
1984). These heuristics or "rules of thumb" are generally quite useful in
reducing the amount of information to be processed. However, there are

certain situations in which these judgmental heuristics have been shown to
bias decisional outcomes in systematic ways (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1978;
Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982; Nisbett & Ross, 1980). Although there are
a number of decisional biases that have been identified (Kahneman, Slovic,
& Tversky, 1982), this study will examine two biases that are particularly
likely to influence negotiator behavior. In both cases, we will argue that the
systematic bias reduces the likelihood of resolution and decreases the quality
of the final contract obtained by the biased negotiator. Specifically, this paper
examines the impact on negotiations of negotiators' (1) framing conflict in
terms of avoiding losses, as opposed to obtaining gains, and (2) being overconfident of the acceptability of their bargaining positions. We chose these
two biases as representatives of the population of decisional biases because
we had an a priori expectation concerning the impact of these two decision
biases on concessionary behavior, and thought that evidence regarding this
expectation will be important in improving dispute resolution techniques.
Prior to any further development of the study, it is important to give an
overview of the framing and overconfidence biases by (1) describing each
particular bias, (2) relating each bias to the negotiation process, and
(3) specifying predictions that flow from the application of these two biases
to the negotiation situation.
Framing
Kahneman and Tversky's (1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) prospect
theory has suggested that decision makers treat the prospect of gains and
losses quite differently. Consider the following example from Tversky and
Kahneman (1981: 453):
The U.S. is preparingfor the outbreakof an unusual Asian disease
which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs
are being considered. Which would you favor?
1. If ProgramA is adopted, 200 people will be saved.
2. If ProgramB is adopted, there is a 1/3 probabilitythat all will
be saved and a 2/3 probability that no one will be saved.
Of the 159 respondents, 76 percent chose Program A - the certain outcome while 24 percent chose Program B - the risky outcome. The prospect of being
able to save 200 lives for certain was more attractive than a risky prospect
of equal expected value. A second group of subjects received the same cover
story with the following options:
1. If If ProgramA is adopted, 400 will die.
2. If ProgramB is adopted, there is a 1/3 probabilitythat no one
will die and a 2/3 probability that all will die.
Of the 169 respondents, only 13 percent chose the certain outcome of Program
A while 87 percent chose the risky outcome of Program B. That is, the prospect
of 400 people dying for certain is less acceptable than a 2/3 probability that
600 people will die, although the expected values of the two choices are
equivalent. Based upon these and related findings (Kahneman & Tversky,
1979; Thaler, 1980; Tversky &Kahneman, 1981), individuals are risk-averse-preferring a certain outcome over a risky one - when evaluating the pros-

pect of gains. Further, Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) prospect theory states
that potential gains and losses are evaluated relative to their effect on current
wealth. Choice is explained by an S-shaped value function-a value function
that is convex, indicating a risk-averse orientation, for gains and concave,
indicating a risk-seeking orientation, for losses. This figure shows that the
value placed on saving 200 lives is more than one-third of the value placed
on saving 600 lives. In contrast, the value loss suffered by losing 600 lives is
not three times as great as losing 200 lives.
Consider a hypothetical labor-management situation. The union claims
they need a raise to $12/hour, and that anything less would represent a loss
to employees given the current inflationary environment. In contrast, management claims that they cannot pay more than $10/hour, and that anything

more would impose an unacceptale loss to the company. In this simplified
one-issue case, what if each side had the option of either settling for $11/hour
or going to arbitration? Since both parties typically view negotiation in terms
of what they have to lose, following Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) basic
propositions, they will respond in a risk-seeking manner and are likely to
choose arbitration.
Theoretically, for arbitration to be an effective impasse procedure, it
must be infrequently used (Feuille, 1977). A usual explanation for the lack of
use of more successful forms of arbitration (e.g., final offer by package
arbitration) is that these forms impose costs on the participants for their
having resorted to impasse. Examples of the costs of arbitration include
(1) the additional time commitment of the participants required in the arbitral process, (2) the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, (3) the increased
uncertainty of the outcome-as the parties no longer have control over the
final outcome - and (4) the lowered quality of the final outcome. The quality
of the arbitrated award is lower than that of a negotiated agreement, assuming that the parties at conflict can better fashion a contract that meets their
needs than can a neutral third party (Crawford, 1979). Thus, an arbitration
award of an $11 hourly wage can be expected to be of lower quality than a
negotiated contract including an $11 hourly wage.
Changing the subjective gain/loss situation, given the same objective
situation specified above, results in a very different predicted outcome. If
the union views anything above $10/hour as a gain and management views
anything under $12/hour as a gain, then a positive frame will exist, risk
aversion will tend to dominate, and negotiated settlement will generally
occur. The implication of the above framework is critical. Both sides in
negotiations often talk in terms of why they need a certain wage - they talk
in terms of losses. What if they believe themselves? The first scenario above
provides the answer! They will adopt a negative frame, exhibit risk-seeking
behavior, and increase the likelihood of their reaching impasse because of a
general reduction in concessionary behavior. Specifically, as suggested by
Farber and Katz (1979), a risk-seeking orientation - such as that resulting
from evaluating the prospect of losses - will lead to an increased likelihood
of reaching impasse and invoking arbitration. Conversely, a risk-averse
orientation - such as that resulting from evaluating the prospect of gains
will lead to an increased likelihood of reaching a negotiated settlement. In
addition, because the negative frame is posited to increase the frequency of
impasse, the quality of the outcomes determined by third party intervention
should be lower than that obtained by reaching a negotiated settlement, as
the two parties should be able to reach an agreement superior to that imposed
by a third party (Crawford, 1979).
Negotiator Overconfidence
Negotiator overconfidence represents a second bias that reduces concessionary behavior and negotiator success in reaching agreement. While research

on clinical judgment, decision making, and probability estimation has demonstrated many systematic deviations from rationality, evidence also shows
that individuals have unwarranted confidence in their fallible judgment
(Einhorn & Hogarth, 1978). Realistically confident individuals should, for
example, be accurate on 80 percent of the judgments to which they give confidence judgments of 80 percent. Laboratory studies, however, find overconfidence to be common. For example, for a large group of two-choice questions for which subjects were 75 percent confident that their judgment was
correct, typically only 60 percent of the questions have been correctly
answered. For confidence judgments of 100 percent, it is common for subjects
to be correct only 85 percent of the time (Fischhoff, 1982). Finally, when
people put confidence intervals around numerical judgments (e.g., "I am 95
percent certain that there are between 500 and 700 pennies in the jar"), it
is common for the actual number (of pennies) to fall outside the 95 percent
boundaries for 50 percent of all subjects (Bazerman & Neale, 1983).
The level of confidence with which the negotiator evaluates the likelihood of a particular offer being accepted specifically addresses this issue of
probability assessment. As Einhorn and Hogarth (1978, 1981) and Lichtenstein, Fischhoff, and Phillips (1982) demonstrate, people generally tend to
be overconfident in judging their chances of success. One of the primary
goals of negotiation is to convince an opponent of the feasibility of the focal
negotiator's offer and the unfeasibility of the opponent's offer. One probable
result of this process is that negotiators may well convince themselves that
their particular offers are obviously more equitable and would therefore be
chosen by the arbitrator should impasse be declared. Unless negotiators are
able to take their opponent's perspective, they are likely to underestimate
the value of their opponent's position (Neale & Bazerman, 1983), a tendency
that would then lead to their attaching a higher probability to the arbitrator's
accepting their offers than is realistic.
Bazerman and Neale (1982) have found that the higher negotiators evaluate their probability of success to be, the less concessionary will be their
behavior. The more secure negotiators are of their current offers being accepted
by arbitrators, the less they will compromise on final offers. Negotiator overconfidence is the norm. They (Neale & Bazerman, 1983) have also found
that, while in the aggregate only 50 percent of all final offers can be accepted,
subjects believed that, on the average, they had a 65.4 percent chance of final
offer acceptance by the arbitrator in final offer by package arbitration. This
overestimation of the probability of success can have serious consequences
for the outcome of a negotiation. If negotiators had more accurately assessed
the likelihood of success, they might have behaved quite differently in terms of
concessionary behavior and information gathering in order to raise the probability of success to a more acceptable level. Overconfidence should decrease
negotiators' willingness to concede as they will have misjudged the amount
of compromise necessary to reach resolution. Thus, we posit that overconfidence results in lower resolution rates and less successful outcomes.

Our predictions concerning the effects of framing and overconfidence on
negotiator behaviors can be formally stated as follows:
Hypothesis 1. Negotiators who frame negotiations in terms
of losses will use less concessionary processes during the
negotiation and have less successful outcomes than will
negotiators who frame negotiations in terms of gains.
Hypothesis 2. Individuals who are overly confident about
the accuracy of their judgment of the probability of success
in final offer arbitration will use less concessionary processes and have less successful outcomes than will those
who are realistically confident about the accuracy of their
judgments.

METHODS
Subjects
One hundred male and female undergraduate students from the College
of Business Administration at the University of Texas who were enrolled in
the upper-division management course volunteered to participate in this
experiment. They were told that they were participating in a study of bargaining behavior.
Procedure
Two independent variables were employed in a 2 x 2 factorial design.
Factor A was a negative or positive frame of the bargaining situation resulting from a memorandum presented to the subject. Factor B was the level of
negotiator confidence (realistic confidence vs. overconfidence) in securing a
successful outcome. Because of the nature of the manipulations, eight experimental confederates who were unaware of the theoretical basis of the experiment served as the union negotiators. They had extensive practice in the
negotiation simulation and used a strategy of reciprocal concessions (reciprocity norm) (Esser & Komorita, 1975). While there is research suggesting
that negotiators do not follow a straight reciprocity strategy (Hartnett &
Cummings, 1980), or any other one strategy consistently, we chose this particular strategy to limit, to the extent possible, the amount of experimental
"noise" generated by the confederates. Thus, the choice of a consistent negotiating strategy was one mechanism to reduce the impact of multiple confederates with different negotiating styles.
In addition to the extensive practice in the negotiation simulation, the
confederates got instructions to secure the best contract they could for the
union given certain constraints. These constraints consisted of (1) a specific
starting position in the negotiation - the union's initial offer - and (2) matching opponents' concessions with their own. Further, the confederates were

<-----Page 7----->40

unaware of the decision-rule nature of the arbitration decision. Their ignorance of the decision-rule was, in part, a function of the opponents' asymmetric valuations of the issues and the confederates' lack of knowledge of this
aspect of the game. That is, some issues were of greater value to the union
than to management and neither party had access to the other's valuation.
Upon arriving at the experimental site, subjects were assigned the roles
of management negotiators while the confederates were assigned the roles of
union negotiators. It might be interesting from a framing perspective to determine if the role affects the negotiator's frame. Traditionally, the union may
be positively framed by virtue of seeking contractual increases - gains while management may be negatively framed by being requested to give up
value to the union. Of course, with the recent union "givebacks," the customary frame of these two institutions may be reversed. However, the goal of this
study was limited to determining if framing had any systematic effect on
negotiator behavior in the context that the study set up.
We then randomly assigned subjects to one of four experimental
conditions: negatively framed, overconfident; negatively framed, realistically
confident; positively framed, overconfident; or positively framed, realistically confident. Confederates were blind as to the particular assigned condition of their opponents; confederate-subject pairs were of the same sex.
The frame condition was manipulated by means of a memorandum to
the negotiator from the personnel director. For both conditions, all objective
information was identical. That is, a number of settlement points on each of
five issues were identified. Each settlement point was coupled with a figure
that represented the net gain or loss in dollars for settling at that particular
point. In the negatively framed condition, subjects were informed that:
Any concessions beyond those granted will represent serious
financial losses to the company. Please rememberthat your primaryobjectiveis to minimize such losses to the company.I cannot
emphasize the severity of this situation enough. It is mandatory
that you, as Townsford'srepresentative,secure the necessaryconcessions from the union to reduce our losses to a tolerable level.
In the positively framed condition, subjects received the following instructions:
Any union concession from their current position will result in
gains for the company. Please rememberthat your primaryobjective is to maximizesuch gains forthe company.I cannotemphasize
the importance of these gains to Townsford enough. It is mandatory that you, as Townsford's representative, secure such concessions from the union to increase these gains to a meaningful
level.
After receiving and reading an informational packet (Grigsby & Bigoness,
1982) consistent with their assigned role and frame, participants received
instructions concerning the upcoming negotiation. In addition, the consequence of reaching impasse-final offer by package arbitration-was explained
to theni. This explanation was coupled with a rather detailed written description of the particular arbitration process that could occur. After the subjects
had read the packets and listened to the explanations, any questions they

<-----Page 8----->1985

Neale and Bazerman

41

had concerning the negotiation or arbitration process were answered. Subjects then participated in a practice negotiating session with a confederate
negotiator in the union role. This confederate was not the same individual
the subject would oppose in the actual negotiating session. The purpose of
the 15 minute practice negotiating session was to familiarize subjects with
the content of the bargaining simulation as well as to allow them the opportunity to develop and list arguments to support their positions.
After the practice session, the portion of subjects previously assigned to
the realistically confident condition participated in a training session focusing on their tendency to overestimate their probability of success. The training consisted of a discussion and illustration of the overconfidence with
which individuals imbue their fallible judgments. That is, subjects assigned
to the realistically confident condition were told that negotiators routinely
overestimated their likelihood of being awarded the contract in final offer
arbitration. Subjects were also told that, on the average, respondents in an
earlier study indicated that they had a 65.4 percent chance of their final offers
being accepted. The experimenter then suggested that this figure indicated a
state of overconfidence, since only one of the two final offers would be
accepted-there was only a 50 percent chance of the average final offer being
accepted. During the training of this realistically confident group, the experimenter specifically avoided any reference, explicit or implicit, to behaviors
that could result from a more realistic level of confidence. The training
consisted only of informing the subjects that such a tendency existed. The
other half of the subjects, those assigned to the overconfident condition,
received no training. We expected that a lower estimation of their probability of success would be the subjects' obvious behavioral response to the
training; we thought an interesting response on their parts would be their
increasing their probability of success by fashioning more equitable contracts through additional concessionary behavior.
Once the training session was complete, the negotiating opponents bargained for 20 minutes. The confederate union negotiator initiated the bargaining process by presenting the first proposal on the issues. The five issues
negotiated were vacation pay, hospital (medical) plan, wages, paid sick days,
and night shift differential. All issues were presented to the subjects at the
same time and the participants were free to negotiate these issues in whatever manner they chose. If, after 20 minutes, they had not reached resolutions,
negotiators were asked to submit a final offer to the arbitrator and to then
estimate the proabability that this final offer would be accepted. The arbitrator then chose the final offer that was least costly to the opponent; that is,
management's final offer was evaluated in terms of what it would cost union,
and union's final offer was evaluated in terms of what it would cost
management. The final offer chosen was the one that exacted the least cost
from the opponent - in other words, represented the greatest overall concession rate. The negotiators involved were then informed of the arbitral outcome and the specifics of the contract. On the other hand, if the negotiators
reached a resolution, they were simply asked to sign a copy of the final

<-----Page 9----->42

contract. We then asked all subjects to complete a short questionnaire assessing their evaluation of the contract and the means by which they secured
that contract.
Measures
The hypotheses concerned the prediction of two dependent variables:
(1) concessionary processes, and (2) successful outcomes. Concessionary processes were measured in three ways: (a) amount of concession (b) number of
issues resolved during the negotiation session, and (c) level of competitiveness. Amount of concession was measured by the dollar difference between
subjects' initial positions and their contracts if resolution was reached, or by
final offers in cases of impasse. The number of issues resolved was measured
by how many of the five issues the negotiators reached agreement on. Level
of competitiveness experienced by subjects was measured by summing their
opponents' responses to four 7-point agree/disagree items (a = .81). The
following is a sample item: "My opponent was very competitive in his/her
bargaining stance."
Successful outcomes were also measured in three ways: (a) whether or
not resolution occurred, (b) dollar value of final contracts to management
negotiators, and (c) subjects' perceptions of the fairness of the contract.
Each of these interrelated measures represents a valued outcome to management negotiators. The dollar value of the contract was measured as the sum
of the dollar gains (savings) or losses (costs) to the company for that particular settlement point across all five issues. If all five issues were agreed upon
during negotiation, then resolution was reached. Finally, perceived fairness
was measured by summing the subjects' responses to six 7-point agree/disagree
items (a = .78). The following is a sample item: "The offers made by my
opponent were fair."
Finally, we obtained measures for checking each of the manipulations.
The framing manipulation was verified by measuring the subjects' expected,
acceptable bargaining outcome prior to negotiation (predicted outcome). The
manipulation check, although somewhat indirect, focused on what the negotiator viewed as an acceptable settlement. Extrapolating from Farber and
Katz (1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1981), we predicted that the negatively framed negotiators would demand a premium for foregoing arbitration
and reaching negotiated agreements. They would require a larger share of the
objective "pie" be contained in a contract for it to be acceptable to them than
would positively framed individuals. The confidence manipulations were
verified by the probability assessments reported for the likelihood that their
final offers would be accepted if arbitration were invoked.
RESULTS
Analysis of the effectiveness of the manipulations showed that the predicted acceptable bargaining outcome (the framing manipulation) was significantly greater for the negatively framed condition than for the positively

<-----Page 10----->1985

framed condition: F1,98 = 5.8, p<.02; $20,794 (s.d. = 10,415) versus $16,051
(s.d. = 9,825). Also, the assessments of probability of success (the confidence
manipulation check for those subjects who did not reach agreement) were
significantly higher for those individuals in the overly confident condition
than in the realistically confident condition: F1,37 = 5.8, p<.02; 68.9 percent
(s.d. = 16) versus 57.7 percent (s.d. = 10). When the concessionary rates of
these two groups were compared, the realistically confident groups were
significantly more concessionary than were those in the overconfident group;

F1,98 = 7.7, p<.01; $34,680 (s.d.
An inspection of the correlation matrix (Table 1) of the dependent variables confirmed the predicted relationship among the three variables reflectof competitiveness (COMPETE) (scored
ing concessionary processes-level

during the bargaining session (NRSLVD)-and the three variables represent(RESLN), value of the contract (CONing successful outcomes-resolution

Measures for concessionary processes and successful outcomes were therefore derived by standardizing each process and outcome indicator (with a
mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1) and then adding the three standard
scores for each construct together. Subsequent analyses were conducted on
the two resulting dependent variables.
Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) yielded no significant interaction effects. Further, the ANOVA results showed there were no significant
differences in the dependent variables as a function of sex of subject or
particular confederate (p<.70 and p<.40, respectively). The means and standard deviations for the dependent variables are presented in Table. 2. For

<-----Page 11----->44

further clarification, the means of the original dependent variables are presented in Table 3. In general, this table illustrates that the components of
both the process and outcome constructs are all in the predicted direction;
that is, amount of concession, number of issues resolved, value of the final
contract, perceived fairness of the contract, and percentage of negotiated
agreements were all greater under the positively framed and realistically
confident conditions. Further, as predicted, the perceived level of competition was greater under the negatively framed and overconfident conditions.
Frame
ANOVA results showed that the frame of the negotiation significantly
affected the negotiation process: F197 ==8.7; p<.004; w2 = .068; -.755 (s.d. =
2.8) versus .786 (s.d. = 2.3). That is, negotiators who viewed the situation
from a negative frame, in terms of what they stood to lose, showed little
concessionary behavior. The analysis of successful outcomes suggested that
the frames of management negotiators significantly influenced outcomes in
the predicted direction: F1,97 = 20.5, p<.0001; o2 = .159; -1.0 (s.d. = 2.6)
versus 1.1 (s.d. = 1.7). Thus, positively framed negotiators had more successful outcomes than did negatively framed negotiators. In both analyses, only
a small portion of the variance was accounted for.

in their judgments showed less concessionary behavior in the negotiation

confident negotiators (those who received training) were able to obtain outcomes that were superior to those of individuals who were overconfident:

was accounted for.

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this experiment was to identify systematic ways in which
negotiators' judgments affect both the process and outcome of contract
negotiations. The results showed that both the frame of negotiation and the
level of confidence with which negotiators evaluate bargaining situations are
instrumental in shaping both the outcome and the process of bargaining.
Thus, both a negotiator's frame and level of confidence exert significant
influence on whether or not the negotiator will choose the risky option of
arbitration rather than accepting the certainty of a negotiated settlement. It
should be noted, however, that the frames of negotiators and their levels of
confidence accounted for only a small percentage of the variance. Thus,
although these judgmental biases have a significant impact on negotiator
behavior, obviously more is going on in the negotiation interaction than can
be explained by these two variables.
Given these results and Kahneman and Tversky's (1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) prospect theory, we suggest that individuals are more likely
to choose a certain outcome - the negotiated settlement - when evaluating
the prospects of perceived gains. But when individuals evaluate the prospect
of losses, they behave in a more risk-seeking manner-they are more likely to
choose the risky option of arbitration rather than to take what appears to be a
certain loss. This finding is especially interesting considering that their invoking arbitration resulted in our subjects' obtaining less successful outcomes
than were obtained by those reaching negotiated settlements. It appears that if
individuals view potential outcomes in terms of what they have to lose, both
parties become risk-seekers, impasse is likely to be declared, and arbitration
invoked. Conversely, if individuals evaluate potential outcomes in terms of
gains, they behave in a risk-averse manner and are more likely to reach a
negotiated settlement.
The second variable that we found explained differences in resolution
behavior was the level of confidence negotiators have in the likelihood of the
arbitrator choosing their offers in final offer arbitration. We found that the

confidence training exerted considerable influence on how negotiators bargained as well as on the likelihood of a negotiated outcome. If negotiators
were overconfident, this overconfidence was reflected in their overestimating the expected value of the uncertain outcome - the arbitrated contract.
Overestimating the value of the uncertain outcomes may be sufficient to
cause risk-averse negotiators to choose the risky option of arbitration because
the premium demanded then appears so large as to block agreement. More
realistic assessments of their chances of success should and did result in
increases in the probability of their choosing negotiated over arbitrated
settlements. When negotiators are more realistic in their assessment of success - in the realistically confident condition - the probability of a negotiated outcome increases.
The results support the notion that it is critical for negotiation researchers to consider the effect of negotiators' systematic biases on the developing
character of the negotiation process. These findings may be especially relevant in demonstrating the impact of these systematic biases on the practice
of third-party intervention procedures, particularly mediation. If the effects
found here are real and prove to be consistent with results from nonstudent
samples, this knowledge can be used to augment the efficacy of a third party
in successfully encouraging parties to reach a negotiated settlement. This
"push" towards a negotiated outcome can improve the process of collective
bargaining by returning the responsibility for settlements to the negotiators
themselves. However, this study did not collect data that could inform the
timing of such interventions by mediators.
Finally, the results of the study have implications for the training of
negotiators. Currently, this training seems functionally to be an apprentice
arrangement. Because the reliance on decisional biases is not restricted to
the uninitiated (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), the apprenticeship method of
training negotiators is unlikely to have a significant impact on reducing their
vulnerability to these biases. But if negotiators can be made aware, through
specific training, of the systematic ways in which they can and do perceptually alter the negotiation situation, they may be able to use this information
to realize significant strategic advantages over less sophisticated opponents.
Specifically, if negotiators can be trained to (1) be alert to the systematic
biases to which they are vulnerable, (2) differentiate actual, objective gains
or losses from the perceptions of gains or losses, and (3) understand and
anticipate the effects of opponents' attempts to manipulate the frame of the
negotiation, level of confidence, and salience of various costs to the negotiator through attitudinal restructuring (Walton & McKersie, 1965), they may be
able to use this knowledge to their particular advantage in the collective
bargaining situation.
There are obvious limitations to this study. Particularly salient in this
context is the issue of generalizability of these results to other than student
populations. In its most conservative interpretation, the results of this study
indicate only that an experimenter can manipulate the frame and level of
confidence of students negotiating with confederates under a reciprocity

strategy so as to significantly alter both the processes and outcomes of their
bargaining behavior. Further, these results say nothing about the impact of
framing and overconfidence biases with different negotiating strategies (e.g.,
hard, soft, or principled strategies).
Although the use of student subjects quickly raises the specter of
nongeneralizability of these results, there is some support for the idea that
human decision making processes are comparable across different levels of
professional training and experience. Einhorn and Hogarth (1978) suggest
that neither professional training nor experience necessarily increase the
soundness of professional decisions. Further empirical research into the
decision making processes of experienced versus inexperienced decision
makers has been equivocal with respect to outcomes. Research has shown
both that experience with a task improves judgments relative to that task
(Christensen-Szalanski & Beach, 1982; Phelps & Shanteau, 1978; Slovic, 1969)
and that experience with a task does not improve judgment relative to the
task (Bushyhead & Christensen-Szalanski, 1981; Einhorn & Hogarth, 1978).
Most research that has identified differences has focused solely on the outcome of judgments and has ignored the cognitive processes involved in
arriving at decisions. Because our research emphasizes heuristics that influence cognitive processes, the use of student subjects-who seem to be vulnerable to the same decisional biases as experienced individuals-is,
on some
levels, justified.
Our findings raise a number of interesting issues that should be
addressed in the future. Additional studies should explore the effects of
systematic biases on negotiator behaviors and negotiation outcomes. For
example, it would be useful to explore the effects of different levels of accountability of negotiators to constituencies on the extent to which negotiatiors
fall prey to these systematic biases. Next, do differences in the way individual negotiators process information - for instance, differences in levels of
perspective-taking ability - moderate the intensity of these cognitive biases
and reduce the likelihood of reaching negotiated settlements? Other future
research could address the issue of generalizability. There are many rich
negotiation contexts besides collective bargaining that remain uncharted.
Future studies could investigate these other contexts to determine how they
are influenced by framing, overconfidence, and other systematic biases. An
obvious avenue of exploration, particularly for the framing bias, is the effect
on typical buyer/seller transactions of specifying the task as one of minimizing expenses (a negative frame) versus maximizing profit (a positive frame).
Thus, there seems to be considerable work to be done within the negotiation
context in the identification, prediction, and removal of systematic biases
that influence individuals' abilities to make effective decisions.
