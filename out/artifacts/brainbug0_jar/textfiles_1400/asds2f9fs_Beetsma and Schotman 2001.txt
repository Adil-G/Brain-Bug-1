DATA

Roel M. W.J. Beetsmaand Peter C. Schotman
We use data from a television game show involving elementary lotteries as a natural experiment
to measure risk attitudes. Unique features of our data set are the substantial monetary stakes
and the large sample size. CRRAand CARAutility specifications perform approximately equally
well. We find robust evidence of substantial risk aversion. Extensions of the basic model, which
allow for a separate utility flow purely from playing the game or for decisions based on decision
weights instead of actual probabilities, raise the estimated degree of risk aversion.

Risk attitudes play a critical role in determining the demand for insurance as
well as the demand for risky assets and the equilibrium returns on these assets.
Despite the importance of risk preferences, we still have very little idea about
the answer to empirical issues like the average risk aversion of individuals, the
determinants of risk attitudes and the heterogeneity of risk preferences among
individuals. The empirical findings depend to a large extent on the particular
methods used to investigate these issues. Friend and Blume (1975) obtain
indirect evidence about the degree of risk aversion from individual asset
holdings. They estimate the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA) at
roughly between 2 and 3. Other indirect evidence is provided by the equity
premium puzzle. The observed spread between average stock returns and the
risk-free interest rate can only be consistent with an expected-utility maximising framework if we assume extremely large values for the RRA coefficient,
usually around 20.1 Campbell (1996) shows that the puzzle is compounded if
one includes human capital in measured wealth.
Direct evidence on the degree of risk aversion is obtained from experiments
and surveys. Gertner (1993) uses data from the television game show 'Card
Sharks', and finds risk-aversion estimates that are comparable to Friend and
Blume's (1975) estimates, although somewhat higher. In another natural
experiment, based on the television game show 'Jeopardy', Metrick (1995)
concludes that players display near risk neutrality. In an experiment in which
Chinese students are presented with basic lotteries, Kachelmeier and Shehata
(1992) find large differences between how much individuals are willing to pay
for a lottery and for how much they are willing to sell the same lottery. This
suggests that revealed risk preferences depend on the way problems are

framed. Barsky et al. (1997) provide survey evidence which suggests that
heterogeneity in risk preferences is important.2
In this paper, we use data from the finals of the Dutch television game show
LINGO to measure risk attitudes. The LINGO final is a word guessing game
which evolves over several rounds. At the start of each round, players decide
whether to stop or to continue with the possibility of doubling the money they
have won so far or losing everything, in which case the game ends. Due to its
specific structure, the game reduces to a series of elementary lotteries in which
the survival chances fall over the rounds, while the money stakes rise. The
players' decisions thus give an indication about their risk attitudes. For several
reasons, LINGO provides a suitable natural experiment in this regard. First, the
decisions that players have to take are extremely simple, because LINGO is a
non-strategic game. Second, the decisions involve serious amounts of money
for most players. On average, a player takes home over 2,500 Dutch guilders (1
Dutch guilder (f) is approximately $0.5), while at the later stages of the game
players often must make decisions with more than f10,000 at stake. The
necessity of large stakes for inference on risk aversion has often been emphasised, most recently by Rabin (2000). Finally, the game has been shown so
often on television (on one of the main channels), that most of the players can
be expected to be at least reasonably familiar with the game (in addition, there
is a pre-qualifying tournament). All this helps to contribute to the validity of
the assumption that players take decisions that reveal their true risk preferences.
We start the empirical analysis by investigating to what extent the players'
decisions can be explained by 'rules-of-thumb' variables. These are observable
statistics from the game (for example, statistics that give an indication of the
survival chances, which are not directly observable). By estimating such
exploratory regressions, we obtain an idea of what factors are critical in
determining the players' decisions.
Our next step is to adopt an expected-utility maximising framework and
estimate both constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) and constant absolute risk
aversion (CARA) utility specifications for the players. This part of the analysis
is in the spirit of Gertner (1993). We confirm his results, qualitatively speaking,
with an independent (and larger) data set for a game which is even simpler
from the players' perspective.3 If we calibrate initial wealth at the median
Dutch household wealth, we obtain an estimate for relative risk aversion of
approximately 7.
We consider several extensions of the basic expected-utility model. First, we
allow for heterogeneity in the ability to guess words and, therefore, differences
in the survival chances across players. This extension hardly affects our results.
Second, because LINGO might attract people that are especially keen on
2
Heterogeneity in risk preferences may help to explain why so few people are stockholders (Mankiw
and Zeldes, 1991), which, in its turn, might have important effects for the behaviour of asset returns.
3 In contrast to Gertner
(1993), in modelling the players' decisions, we can take explicit account of
the effect of future decisions on the current optimal decision.

playing these types of games and on being on television, we allow for the
possibility that the players derive additional utility purely from playing the
game. Ceterisparibus, teams would continue longer. Hence, to explain the stop
decisions in the data, the estimated degree of risk aversion has to increase.
Third, we replace the actual survival probabilities with unobserved decision
weights, as Prospect Theory - see Kahneman and Tversky (1979; 1982) and
Tversky and Kahneman (1992) - suggests. This extension is motivated by the
substantial amount of evidence that suggests that individuals tend to be
overconfident when taking decisions under risk.4 In the current context,
individuals may systematically overestimate their odds because they overestimate their ability to solve the word puzzles in LINGO.5 Our estimates indeed
suggest that players tend to overestimate their survival chances. To nevertheless explain that they do sometimes stop, the estimated degree of risk aversion
increases further.6
The final step in our analysis consists of some general robustness checks on
the model. First, we test whether adding our 'rules-of-thumb' variables could
help to explain decisions not captured by the expected-utility model. While
the latter renders most of these variables irrelevant, it seems that it is not able
to account fully for the effects of variables that point to possible heterogeneity
in ability and in risk attitude. Second, we simulate the estimated decision
model to show that it generates outcomes that match other features of the
data.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 1 describes the
game, while Section 2 describes the data and reports summary statistics. In
Section 3 we estimate decision models based on rules-of-thumb. Section 4
provides the theory for the estimation of the expected-utility maximisation
models. In particular, we show that due to the particular structure of the game,
the players' multi-stage decision problem can be effectively reduced to a onestage decision problem. Section 5 reports and discusses the empirical results
for the basic expected-utility model. Section 6 explores the extensions of the
basic expected-utility model and provides some general robustness checks.
Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

possibility is that players display bounded rationality - for a recent survey, see Conlisk
(1996) - when computing their odds. However, it is hard to see how this could lead to the systematicbias
in the perceived odds suggested by our results.

Although it is sometimes argued that transformations of probabilities should be considered as an
integral part of an individual's risk attitudes (Wakker, 1994), we believe that a person's ability to assess
his odds should be distinguished from his personal risk attitude.

involves a 'pre-final' and a 'final'. In the pre-final, two couples have to guess
five-letter words (for which they are given certain clues - see Appendix). For
each word they guess correctly, a couple receives f50. The couple which has
solved the most five-letter words at the end of the pre-final progresses to the
final. The other couple goes home with the money it has won and cannot
come back for any further games. In the pre-final, teams have one other
possibility of winning money, which is totally unrelated to the game. This side
effect is called the jackpot (see Appendix).
Our main interest is in the final. The final is played over a maximum
number of five rounds. In essence, each round involves an elementary lottery,
as depicted in Fig. 1. The couple enters the round with a particular stake. For
the first round, this is the amount of money won in the pre-final. At the start of
each round, the couple decides whether to continue or to stop. If they stop,
they take home their current stake and are not allowed to come back for any
further games. If they continue, they must play a lottery. If they win the lottery,
their stake for the start of the next round doubles; if they lose, all the money is
lost, the game stops and the couple is allowed to come back in the next show
unless this is their third, and last, final. If they come back they play again a prefinal against another couple, in which they either drop off, or win and enter
the next final.7 Given that they are not allowed to come back after their third
final, a couple also plays at most three pre-finals. Finally, if a couple has won
the lottery in all five rounds in any given final, they are not allowed to come
back. Fig. 2 summarises all the possible routes for an arbitrary couple from the
start of its first pre-final until it leaves for good. It also shows the potential
sources of the total accumulated gains for each of the possible routes.
The actual game in each round of the final again involves guessing a fiveletter word (with similar clues being given as in the pre-final). The maximum
number of attempts for a word in a given round is five. The number of
attempts determines the number of balls a couple has to draw from an urn. In

particular, for each attempt needed to guess the word in some round the
couple has to draw one ball (without replacement) from the urn. If they did
not guess the word in five attempts, they must draw the maximum number of
six balls.
Now consider the LINGOboard in Fig. 3. At the start of the first round in the
final, each of the nine open boxes, i.e., those not filled with an X, contains
some number, while the urn contains 35 numbered balls and one golden ball.

Once one row, column or the diagonal of the board is completely filled with
X s, the game is over the players lose their stake, as explained above. In the
initial position this would happen if the ball with the number 5 is drawn.
Once the couple has drawn the required number of balls (without a row,
column or the diagonal of the board having become completely filled with
X ), they go to the start of the next round. If, at some point, they draw the
golden ball, they stop drawing balls and survive the round. The golden ball is
placed back into the urn and the couple go immediately to the start of the
next round. At the start of the next round, the stake is doubled and they make
their new decision whether to stop (and take home their new stake) or to
continue. The starting position of the board and the urn is the one inherited
from the end of the previous round.
Summarising, LINGO provides a natural experiment for measuring risk
attitudes, because at the start of each round in a given final, the players face a
very simple decision problem: whether to continue. Moreover, because with
any new draw from the urn, either the number of 'good' balls in the urn (ie,
the balls with a number that is not on the LINGOboard) decreases or another
box of the board is filled with an X, the survival probabilities are decreasing
over the rounds. This should induce players to stop if the odds become too
unfavourable.
8 For each of the nine numbers in the
open boxes, there is exactly one ball in the urn which contains
the same number.

2. Data and Descriptive Analysis
Most of the data were generously provided by the producer, IDT. The
remainder of the data were obtained by watching the programme on television.9 We use observations from finals 633 to 1,611. This is a total of 979
finals but, of course, this constitutes a much larger number of decisions, given
that each final can last for up to five rounds.
Table 1 shows some key summary statistics for the finals. The entries only
refer to the players who appear in the final. Candidates are selected on the
basis of their ability to guess words and their appearance on television. Hence,
there is no apparent link between the selection criterion and their risk
attitude. For most of the couples, we know their gender. Females are clearly
overrepresented in this game. For about 20% of the finals, we know the ages of
the players. By far, most of them are in their twenties or thirties. Players
younger than twenty and older than sixty-five are very rare. We also know the
education level and/or profession for about 20% of the participants. From this

it appears that students are overrepresented. We have little idea how the
composition of the sample will affect our measures of risk aversion. One source
of information is Hartog et al. (2000) who conducted surveys among Dutch
people, in which respondents were asked about the amounts they would be
wiling to pay for certain lottery tickets. From the answers, it appears that
women are more risk averse than men and that the schooling level reduces risk
aversion. The initial stake in the final, which is equal to the amount a team
wins in the pre-final (Wo guilders), is on average f473. This translates to (25 X
f473 =)f15,136 potential gains for a team that plays and wins all five rounds
in the final. The average realised total gains per couple is approximately
f5,000, which would be quite a serious amount of money for most of them.
The distribution of the gains is very dispersed; more than half of the teams
leave without winning anything in the final.
An important input for calculating the odds in the lotteries is the ability of
couples in solving the word puzzles. Table 2 gives the frequency distribution of
the number of balls that had to be drawn in each of the rounds of the observed
finals. We tested for many different ways of splitting the sample to search for
heterogeneity in ability. Gender differences, age or number of appearances in
the final do not significantly alter the ability distribution. The null hypothesis
of the distributions being equal could only be rejected for a split according to
the amount of money a couple has won in the pre-final round (Wo). The table
shows the distributions for Wo < > 400. Even here the differences are small.
Since we cannot find reliable other instruments for possible heterogeneity in
ability, unless explicitly stated otherwise, we make the assumption that all
couples have the same ability in solving the word puzzles.
Table 3 separates the first, second and third finals into the percentage of
couples that continued and survived all five rounds (WINNER), those who
stopped before or at the end of the fourth round (STOPPER), and those who
won nothing this final (LOSER). As is clear from the table, the percentage of
losers falls, while the percentage of stoppers increases with the number of
appearances in the final. This indicates that people are less willing to take
risks, if they run out of possibilities to return in future shows. Of the losers in
the first final 49% (= 232/475) managed to come back into the second final,

while 50% (= 80/159) of the losers in the second final returned in the third
final. As this means that the probability of winning against a random couple in
the next pre-final is about one half, there must be only minor differences in
abilities across the couples participating in the game.
An important input for the decisions are the odds at which couples play the
next lottery. If j balls must be drawn, then the probability of surviving the next
round can be calculated from the number of balls that remain in the urn
(BALLS) and the number of direct possibilities of filling a row, column or
the diagonal on the LINGO board (BAD). This probability is denoted
Pj(BAD, BALLS). BAD and BALLS together denote the state of game. Using
the ability distribution fj from Table 2 we compute the overall probability of
surviving the next round as

couples stop at survival probabilities well above a half. We almost never observe

so risk averse that they stop at a survival probability of 0.86.

THE

ECONOMIC

JOURNAL

Based on Rules-of-Thumb

Variables

[OCTOBER

This section contains an exploratory data analysis to find out which variables
players may use in their decisions. Before turning to decision rules based on
expected utility maximisation (in the next section), we will study possible
'rules-of-thumb' variables that players might use in deciding whether to stop
(yi = 0) or to continue (yi = 1). We use Probit regressions based on an
indicator y* which is a linear function of variables that players can observe
immediately or that they can compute with little effort. We consider variables
that can reasonably be expected to play a role in the decisions (for example,
because they provide an indication of the survival chances). Formally, the
players stop if y* < 0 and continue otherwise.
The most interesting decisions are the last decision in each show and, in
shows where the players decided to stop, also the next-to-last decision. The last
decisions of winners and losers give an indication of an upper bound on their
risk aversion, while the final two decisions of stoppersjointly give an upper and
a lower bound on their risk aversion. For a given final, our data set of decisions
thus includes stoppers twice (the round they stop and the round before that,
when they still decided to continue) and the other couples once (their last
'play' decision, whether they win or lose). The total number of observations is
1,186. We assume that the error terms in the Probit regressions are uncorrelated, even though we sometimes observe multiple decisions by the same
couple.10 These are the explanatory variables for the decision to play:
* STAKE: the amount of money at stake at the moment the decision is to be
taken
It is included because, at given odds, a larger stake increases the riskiness
of the bet as measured by the variance of the possible outcomes. For this
reason, we would expect STAKEto have a negative effect on the likelihood
to continue in this final.
* FINAL: the number of finals (including this one) played by the candidates.
If FINAL is higher, the number of possiblities for coming back is reduced,
which should discourage the players from continuing. This suggests that
FINALhas a negative effect.
* BALLS: the number of balls still in the urn
A larger value of BALLS raises the survival probability and, hence, we
expect its effect to be positive.
* BAD. the number of open positions on the LINGO board for which a row,
column or the diagonal would be directly filled if the corresponding
number were drawn from the urn
BAD is expected to have a negative effect.
* LAST: the last round of play in this final
This variable is included as an indication of heterogeneity. If teams differ
in their risk attitudes, then the more risk-averse players will stop earlier.
10 The
possible correlations will have no easy pattern, since we can have multiple observations of the
same team for several reasons. A couple may decide to stop (2 observations) or observations span
multiple shows (when a couple returns in a second or third final).

That means that in later rounds of the game, players with less risk aversion
are overrepresented. Because they are less risk averse on average, we
expect teams to be more willing to play in later rounds, ceterisparibus.
* Wo: the initial stake in this final, which may serve as a proxy for the ability
to solve word puzzles
Ceterisparibus, better players would have an incentive to stop later, which
suggests that it should have a positive effect.
* PROB: the survival probability (computed according to (1))
If players in fact base their decisions on a rule-of-thumb, then PROB
should not have any independent explanatory power. It might also be too
complicated to calculate or estimate PROB on the spot. Since PROB is a
function of BAD and BALLS (though highly nonlinear), players who could
somehow estimate their survival probabilities, would no longer need to
base decisions on BAD or BALLS separately, once they know PROB. This
suggests that either PROB, or the combination of BAD and BALLS is
redundant (as an explanatory variable).
Table 5 contains the results of the Probit regressions. All explanatory variables
are significant and have the expected sign, although PROB, BAD and BALLS
cannot be included simultaneously due to severe multicollinearity. The first
regression in Table 5 does not include PROB, and thus tries to explain
decisions by employing only variables that are directly observable by the
players. In the second regression we replace the regressors BALLS and BAD by
PROB. While the other coefficients are basically unaffected, PROB becomes
highly significant. The fit of this model is hardly different from the fit of the
first regression. These results suggest that players take account of their odds by
basing their decisions on variables which are highly correlated with the survival
probabilities computed with the help of equation (1).
This exploratory model serves as a benchmark to evaluate the more structural expected-utility maximisation models that we develop below.

4. Expected-Utility Maximisation
We turn now to the analysis of decision models based on expected-utility
maximisation. We are interested in how well decisions can be explained using
utility functions that are often employed in economic analysis. Moreover, we
would like to know how well these models perform when compared with the
decision models based on rules-of-thumb, which we estimated in Section 3.
The main objective of the expected-utility analysis is to obtain estimates of the
degree of risk aversion.
The decision problem faced by the players seems complicated, because it
may be followed by other decisions. One such complicating factor is the
potential possibility to return the next show after losing today. Instead of
getting zero, one can expect to gain something from tomorrow's game. The
return possibility can be seen as an option which affects decisions in this final
whether to stop or continue. The other option element is the possibility of
deciding again in the next round of the current final. For example, suppose
that the game has evolved until the start of the second round. The decision to
stop would eliminate the possiblity of making a similar decision at the start of
the third round and could therefore affect the decision taken at the start of
the second round. In general, this aspect would require dynamic programming
techniques to solve for the optimal stopping rule.
In this section, we provide some theoretical results pertaining to the specific
game under consideration. In particular, we show that, because of the (weakly)
decreasing survival probabilities over the rounds, the decision problem reduces, under rather weak conditions, from a multi-stage dynamic programming problem to the choice between receiving the current stake with certainty
and a single elementary lottery. This simplifies the analysis of the game
considerably, and motivates the econometric model.
We start the analysis by considering a one-round game, which could be the
last round of an actual final. Let U(x) be the utility that a couple gets from
receiving amount x.11 Fig. 1 (page 824) shows the decision tree for the oneround game. At the start of the round the stake is x. The probability of
surviving this round (PROB) is denoted p. If the players decide to stop, they
keep x with certainty. If they continue, they receive 2x with probability p, while
they obtain utility U(a) with probability 1 - p, where U(a) depends on how
often they could possibly play the final in future shows. The amount a
therefore represents the certainty equivalent (expressed in guilders) of coming
back. In other words, it is the amount they would be willing to pay to come
back in the next show. If the players cannot come back (because it is their
third final), then a = 0.
Denoted by V(A) the expected utility from action A= 0 (stop) or A 1
(continue) at the start of a hypothetical one-round game, so that
1l This assumes that the two players that form a couple have the same utility function, which implies
that they do not disagree about the decision to be taken. In fact, when watching the show on television
we very rarely observe disagreement about whether to continue or to stop. Moreover, we assume that
they share their gains equally. Because we have no way of knowing how they actually share their gains,
this seems to be a rather natural assumption.

(2)

V(0) = U(x)

V(1) = (1-

If x < a, it is always optimal to continue. Throughout this section, we will
therefore assume that x> a. The players will decide to stop if V(1) < V(0), or
equivalently if p is smaller than the critical probability p* given by
p.

U(x) - U(a)
U(2x) - U(a)

(3)

Observe that p* is decreasing in U(a), which means that continuing becomes
relatively more attractive the higher is the utility from returning the next day.
If x < a, we define p* = 0, and players will always continue.
In the empirical analysis we will use two different utility functions. The first
is the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) specification
U(x)^'

(W+ x)l-Y - 1

y>0

(4)

where W acts as a wealth level against which the gains (x) in this final will be
evaluated. We assume that W > 0 and y > 0. Moreover, if W = 0, then we
(otherwise U(0) would no longer be defined), while
impose 0< y <
=
ln(W + x). The critical probability p* follows as
limy,l U(x)
.*

(W+ x)l- - (W+ a)l((W + 2x)1-(W + a)l-Y

(5)

showing that the optimal stopping rule will depend on all parameters
(x, W, y, a).12
W can have several possible interpretations and will, therefore, be referred
to as the referencewealth level. Strictly speaking, under expected-utility maximisation W would be interpreted as the wealth level at the start of the final.
Because initial wealth may well differ across couples and because it is unobservable, it is less suitable in the empirical work. When we use the CRRA function,
we must therefore treat W as a parameter and interpret it as the average level
of wealth of our sample. This is an important drawback of the CRRA utility
function.
In the prospect theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), individuals attach utility, or more precisely 'value', only to current gains and losses
rather than to final wealth. In that case, W = 0 and the CRRA specification
reduces to the power utility function
U(x) =

X1-Y - 1

1 -y

0<y<l

(6)

In their experiments, Kahneman and Tversky (1982) find support for equation
12 If a
couple shares their gains equally, each would have a utility U(x/2), and an initial wealth W/2.
Since (5) is homogeneous of degree zero in x, a and W, decisions based on individual utility or team
utility will be the same.

case is the power utility function for teams in the third final (when a = 0). In
that case, p* = () 'l-, so that decisions would be independent of the stakes of
the lottery. In all other cases, the stakes will matter.
The other type of utility function that we consider is constant absolute risk
aversion (CARA):

U(x) =-exp[-y(W

(7)

Parameter y now denotes the coefficient of absolute risk aversion. Using the
data from their survey, Hartog et al (2000) conclude that CARA is a reasonable
description of the risk attitude of individuals with financial wealth of up to
f100,000. This is substantially higher than the median household wealth in the
Netherlands.
The different implications of the CARA utility function can be seen by
computing the critical probability

The right-hand side of this equation is the probability p for which a riskneutral person is indifferent between receiving x with certainty, or 2x with
probability p and a with probability (1 - p).
Next consider Fig. 4, which shows a two-round game. It could represent the
last two rounds within a given final. Hence, the option value a remains
constant over the two rounds. At the start of the first round, the couple either
stops and takes home x with certainty, or they continue. In the latter case, they
survive, with probability pl and lose with probability 1 - pi. If they play and
survive, they enter the second round, where the game is of the same format as
the one-round game analysed earlier in the section, although now with a
probability p2 and an initial stake of 2x. The expected value of coming back,
given by U(a), is the same as in the first round. The survival probability P2 at
the start of the second round is unknown at the start of the first round. Hence,
the expected utilities from stopping or continuing at the start of the first
round of the two-round game are given by

following proposition:

THE

ECONOMIC

JOURNAL

[OCTOBER

1. Suppose (13) holds. The optimal decision at the start of the first
round of an n-round game is to continue if and only if pi > pp.
PROPOSITION

Proof Here, we give the proof for the two-round game only. This serves as
the first step of the induction argument for the general case, which is
available upon request. We have already seen in (11) that, if it is optimal to
continue at the start of the one-round game, it is also optimal to continue at
the start of the two-round game. Now, we provide the proof for the stop
decision. Suppose that pl < p*, so that it would be optimal to stop at the
start of the one-round game. Since p2 < pi and p* < p2 (by assumption),
one has that p2 < p*. Hence, by the definition of p2 as the critical
probability, we have
max[ U(2x), (1 - p2)U(a) + p2U(4x)] = U(2x)
for all possible realisations of p2. Therefore,
V2(1) = (1 - p) U(a) + pi U(2x)=

V1(1) < V(0) = V2(0)

Together, Proposition 1 and Lemma 1 imply that, for CRRA and CARA utility,
a team should stop the first time the elementary lottery becomes unfavourable.
The option to make similar decisions in future rounds of a given final is
worthless. The intuition is that, if the odds are too unfavourable to continue
now, they will certainly be too unfavourable in future rounds, because they
cannot improve (the set of open positions on the LINGO board remains constant
or shrinks in the remainder of a given final) and the critical survival probabilities
weakly increase (because the amount of money at stake rises).

5. Empirical Results for the Expected-Utility Model
In this section, we present estimates of decision models based on expected
utility maximisation. As we already noted, we assume that all players have the
same utility function. For now, we assume also that all couples have equal
abilities in guessing five-letter words and, therefore, equal survival probabilities
(for a given state of the game).
In Section 4 we showed that, due to the special structure of the game, under
very weak restrictions (see Proposition 1), the player's decision problem at any
moment reduces to an elementary lottery. Expected-utility maximisation then
motivates the following probit model for the stop/play decision,
q

Y2~
Yi
?ipi-~P~Zwhere pi is the survival probability computed as the right-hand side of (1), and
with observations yi 0 (stop) if y* <0 and yi- 1 (continue) if y* > 0.
Teams will play if the survival probability pi exceeds the critical survival
probability p*. The error term ci is assumed to be normally distributed with
mean zero and variance a2. The parameters of the model are the degree of

risk aversion y, the option value of returning the next show for teams in the
first or second final (al and a2, respectively), reference wealth W (for CRRA
utility), and the error variance a2 = E(e2).13'14 The error term could capture a
variety of effects. One would be the presence of non-systematic errors in the
assessment of the survival probability pi. Another would be that individuals
make mistakes in their choices even when they know their odds.15 Finally, the
error term may arise from the presence of heterogeneity among the players
which is not systematically linked to their survived probabilities.
Table 6 shows the estimates for the CRRA utility specification. The first row
shows the results for a power utility specification (W = 0). This specification
assumes that players' utility is determined only by the gains from the game,
without any reference to their level of wealth. The estimate of y of 0.42 is
highly significant (conditional on W = 0), and indicates a strong rejection of
risk neutrality (y = 0).

Notes:Dependent variable is the play/stop decision (1/0). y is the coefficient of relative risk
aversion in the CRRA model. 'Wealth' denotes the reference level of wealth. al and a2 are
the equivalent (guilder) amounts of the 'comeback' utilities. In L is the value of the
loglikelihood at the optimum, and a is the standard deviation of the error term. Standard
errors are in parentheses. The parameters have been estimated by maximum likelihood
conditional on different values of reference wealth. The lower panel of the table is based on
the subsample of teams that are in the final for the third (and last) time, and the
complementary subsample. The hypothesis of equality of y in the two subsamples cannot be
rejected at the 5% level.
13 While in the
previous section, we kept a constant over the rounds, because we considered a given
final, here a is allowed to vary according to whether observations belong to first or second finals (for
third finals, a = 0). We expect that a1 > a2, because the possibility of coming back after the first final
also allows for a possibility of coming back after the second final.
14 Contrary to the standard probit model the residual standard error a is identified. Equivalently, we
could have written y* = /3(pi - p*) + ci with the variance of i normalised to one.
15 In particular, we may observe a stop decision even when x < a. Because stop decisions at low
stakes are very rare, this happens only in a handful of cases.

The other rows of the table report estimates of y for different levels of
reference wealth to demonstrate the dependence between y and W. When we
increase the wealth parameter, the estimate for y also increases. With wealth
equal to f50,000, the relative risk aversion parameter increases to 6.99. All
these models with wealth in excess of f10,000 fit the data about equally well.
This multicollinearity arises because the informative stakes in the games are
mostly concentrated in a range between 2,000 and 5,000 guilders. Within this
range, the utility functions -(10,000 + x)-1'06 and -(50,000 + x)-5 99 imply
very similar critical probabilities p*.
This is illustrated by the following example. Consider a lottery with f4,000 at
stake (x - 4,000). A person with a low wealth W= 10,000 will play the lottery if
the probability of winning is larger than p* = 0.65. Someone with the higher
wealth W= 50,000, but the same relative risk-aversion coefficient will always
play the lottery at this probability, since the stake is relatively low compared to
his higher wealth. To obtain a critical probability p* = 0.65 when the reference wealth level is f50,000, a person must have a higher risk-aversion coefficient. Indeed, when y = 6.99, the critical probability for the f4,000 lottery is
0.63, almost equal to the critical probability at (W = 10,000, y = 2.06). Over
the range of stakes that we see in the data, the combination of low wealth and
a low risk-aversion coefficient implies the same behaviour as high wealth and a
high risk-aversion coefficient. Unrestricted estimation of the CRRA model does
not allow us to identifiy W and y separately. The wealth level of W = 50,000 is
representative for household wealth in the Netherlands.16 Hence, if the
participants of LINGO are representative for the Dutch population, a relative
risk aversion parameter of y = 6.99 would be our best guess.
The results displayed in Table 6 are reminiscent of the findings in the
literature. In general, the literature has found that different measures of
wealth have major effects for asset pricing models. For example, Campbell
(1966) finds that, if the measure of wealth is increased by including human
wealth, the estimate for the CRRA coefficient increases substantially. Jagannathan and Wang (1996) study a cross-section of stock returns and find that
the estimates of the conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM) are
substantially improved by including a measure of human capital in investors'
wealth.
Parameters al and a2 are the estimates of the 'guilder certainty equivalent'
16 Bloemen
(1997) estimates median household wealth in the Netherlands at approximately f50,000
in 1993 and 1994. He also provides median household wealth estimates for various age classes and
education levels of the head of the household. For the set of finals for which the age and the education
level of both players were available (68 finals in total), we attributed to each player the median
household wealth level for the age/education group to which the player belongs. The average of the
household wealth levels thus obtained is approximately f32,500. Since this is only a very rough wealth
estimate of the population of LINGOplayers, in the sequel we use f50,000 as our baseline wealth level.
We note that, if the average Dutch household consists of two persons, then the wealth level per
individual would be f25,000. A team participating in LINGOwould again hold f50,000. Finally, we note
that we have estimated our model on the subsample of finals for which we have the team-specific wealth
estimates. However, we failed to obtain sensible results. With differences in wealth, the values of the
comeback options should be allowed to vary across the teams. The size of the subsample, already small,
does not admit such an extension.

values of coming back when playing the first and second final, respectively.
That is, al (a2) guilders is the amount of money that players would be willing
to pay to be allowed to come back after the first (second) final. The estimates
for al and a2 are both highly significant and sizable, indicating that the
possibility to come back plays an important role in the decisions taken. Note
also that al > a2, as required by the model.
The results for the CARA utility specification in Table 7 are very similar to
those for CRRA utility. The risk-aversion parameter is significantly different
from zero (risk neutrality). With W = 50,000, its estimate of 0.12 implies an
estimated degree of relative risk aversion of 6.0, which is somewhat smaller than
what we obtained for CRRA utility. The option values and the fit are almost
identical to those for the CRRA model. Without data on individual wealth, the
two specifications have similar implications for behaviour in the LINGO game.
To give an impression of what the estimates imply for an agent's risk
attitude, Table 8 considers the choice between x with certainty or a lottery with
payout (2x, a; p, 1 - p). That is, a lottery with pay-off 2x with probability p
and some fixed amount a with probability 1 - p. The table shows that an agent
with constant relative risk aversion, no reference wealth (W = 0 and thus
y = 0.42) would only be willing to take the gamble if the probability of winning
is at least 0.67. For the power utility function (W = 0), the critical probability
does not depend on the stake x. Models with either W= 10,000 or
W = 50,000 fit the data better, and imply that teams are more willing to play if
the stakes are low. The critical probabilities are almost identical for the CRRA
and CARA models.
A positive option value a reduces the critical probabilities. Therefore, firsttime finalists will always play as long as the stakes are below a. Even with stakes
larger than a, first-time finalists should almost always continue. Only if the
stakes are above f4,000, do they require a survival probability that is more than
one half. This usually does not happen until the fourth round of a final. The

Notes:The entries report the critical probabilities p* for various parameter combinations of the CRRA
and CARAutility functions and for various stakes x. The parameter a is the option value for teams that
have the option to return in a next show. Parameter estimates are from Tables 6 and 7. The critical
probabilities are defined as p* = [U(x)- U(a)]/[U(2x) - U(a)] and denote the lowest
win probability at which a player will prefer the lottery with payout (2x, a; p, 1 - p) over the sure
amount x.

most informative data are therefore the decisions made by third time finalists,
who cannot return.
For this reason, we split the complete sample into a subsample containing
third finals only and a subsample containing first and second finals only. The
lower panels of Table 6 and 7 present the subsample estimates for CRRA and
CARA utility, respectively. For the third finals subsample the option values al
and a2 are, of course, not identified. The point estimates of y for the
subsamples are not significantly different from each other. The estimate of y is
significant in both subsamples.
6. Model Extensions

and Robustness

Checks

The results presented in Section 5 for the basic expected-utility model suggest
substantial risk aversion on the side of the LINGOplayers.17 In this section, we
address the robustness of these results by estimating extensions of the basic
expected-utility model and providing some additional checks on these models.

6.1. Heterogeneityin Ability
We found that the amount a team wins in the prefinal, Wo, had a significant
effect on the frequency distribution of the number of balls to be drawn in a
final round (Table 2). This is most likely the result of differences in the ability
to guess words. Heterogeneity in ability means that some teams have a higher
17 The model estimated in the
previous section will from now on be referred as the 'basic expectedutility model' to distinguish it from the extensions discussed in this section.

survival probability in the final and, therefore, play longer. Better teams will also
have a higher option value of returning. They can expect to win more next
show, and might even have a higher probability of winning the prefinal in the
next show. To test these effects, we split the sample of finals into those for which
Wo < 400 and those for which Wo > 400, and allow al and a2 to differ between
these two subgroups. For each of the subgroups, we compute the survival
probabilities according to (1), replacing the overall frequency distribution fj
with the corresponding subgroup-specific frequency distribution.
Table 9 presents the results for CARA utility. The new estimate for y, 0.13,
hardly differs from the original estimate. The estimates of a1 and a2 for the
'high-ability' group exceed those for the 'low-ability' group, although the
difference is only significant in the case of a2. The results for CRRA utility are
not reported, because they almost exactly coincide with those for CARA utility.

6.2. Flow Utility
The participants in the show may not be a random sample from the Dutch
population, but they may rather be people who enjoy these types of games or
who like to be on television. To investigate this issue empirically, suppose that
players derive some additional utility purely from the joy of participating in a
television show. That is, we assume that they have the augmented utility
function
U(x, i) = U(x) + cii

(15)

where i is the round of play in a LINGO final. For teams that stop, the last
round of play is (i-1).
When cl >0, the additional term makes playing
another round more attractive. The critical probability p* now becomes

For CRRA and CARA utility, it is straightforward to see that the critical
probabilities are increasing over the rounds in a given final if cl >0 (use
Lemma 1 and observe that ci/[U(2x) - U(a)] is decreasing in x, x> a).
Hence, as before, the multi-stage decision problem of the players is reduced to
a single, elementary lottery. The row labelled 'Flow utility' in Table 9 contains
the estimation results. We present them only for CARA utility, because the
results for CRRA utility are very similar. Parameter cl is significantly positive.
Compared to the basic model, it is now more attractive to continue longer,
ceterisparibus. Hence, to explain that players occasionally do stop, the estimate
for y increases to 0.20. The difference in the loglikelihoods of the regressions
(see also Table 7) indicates that the basic model is rejected.

6.3. Decision Weights
A third possible extension of the basic model is motivated by empirical
evidence based on psychological models of behaviour which suggests that
individuals tend to be overconfident (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). In the
context of LINGO, such overconfidence would lead players to overestimate
their abilities in solving word puzzles. To model systematic deviations between
actual probabilites and the weights that subjects give to alternative outcomes,
(cumulative) prospect theory introduces the concept of decision weights
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, 1982; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992; Benartzi
and Thaler, 1995). If people are overconfident, the decision weight attached
to survival is larger than the actual survival probability. In that case people will
tend to play longer than would be justified by their risk preferences. However,
the longer people play in the LINGO final, the lower our estimates of risk
aversion. When we mistakenly model the decision rule using the actual survival
probabilities, we will therefore obtain biased low estimates of the risk-aversion
parameter.
We will employ the following flexible double Logit transformation from
actual probabilities p to decision weights 7r(p):
eq

1 + eq
ln[p/(

- p)] -

(17)

0)

If = 0 and ) = 1, the transformation reduces to r -= p. In this specification,
ut acts primarily as a shift parameter and allows for a systematic over- cq.
underestimation of the actual survival probabilty. Parameter co determines the
curvature of the function :r(p).
Players now base their decisions on their own subjective assessment of their
survival chances. Fortunately, since :r(p) is a monotonic and continuous
function of the actual probabilities, the players' decision problem simplifies

again to a single elementary lottery, where the actual survival probability pi is
now replaced by the decision weight 7r(pi). As under the cumulative prospect
Theory, we assume that the decision weights sum to one. Hence, the decision
weight attached to not surviving this round is given by 1 - z7(pi).
In the probit model, the actual probabilities pi are replaced by the decision
weights r(pi),
(18)
Yi =- 7r(pi) P* + i
while p* is still the critical probability defined in (3). Separate identification of
the risk aversion parameter and the parameters in the transformation from
actual probabilities to decision weights rests on the functional specifications
imposed on utility and on the transformation. The different nonlinearities of
:r(pi) and p* identify the parameters. Different assumptions about utility
could, in principle, affect the estimated risk aversion and the estimated
probability transformation. However, in the following, we stick to CRRA or
CARA utility, which we have employed throughout.
In Table 9, we report the parameter estimates for CARA utility. The estimate
of the risk aversion y has doubled compared to the basic expected utility
model. At the same time, the estimated decision weights are higher than the
actual probabilities. The bias is illustrated in Fig. 5, which depicts the estimated
function rt(p). For every observation i, we have that :r(pi) > pi and, in many
cases, the decision weight is substantially larger than the actual probability. If

that is the case, a higher value for y is needed to explain the observed stop
decisions in the data. The value of the log-likelihood functions indicates that
the model fits the data significantly better than the basic model.18

6.4. VariableAddition Tests
In Section 3 a rule-of-thumb model was estimated to describe the behaviour of
teams. If utility maximisation provides a correct description of players' decisions, the expected-utility model should be able to encompass the rule-ofthumb specification. For this purpose, we estimate the probit model

(19)
where pi p* is the difference between the actual and the critical survival
probability computed at the maximum likelihood estimate for the CARA
specification in Table 7 (CRRA utility gives virtually the same results). If the
theoretical choice model provides an adequate description of the behaviour of
the players, all explanatory variables in the vector Zi in (19) should have zero
coefficients.
The first row of Table 10 shows that the basic expected-utility model
certainly beats the most naive decision rule, ie that people always play: the
constant term is not significant. The second row indicates that the expectedutility model correctly captures the effects of the survival probability (BAD,

BALLS, PROB), the 'comeback' options (through FINAL) and the size of the
lotteries (STAKE). When we use the full set of instruments, we find that LAST
denoting the number of the round of the final in which the decision is made and Wo are both significant.
In each of the models, LAST enters with a positive coefficient, which
indicates that people are more inclined to play the further the final progresses,
ceterisparibus. We include LAST to test for heterogeneity in risk preferences.
More risk-averse players will stop earlier, and, therefore, in later rounds of a
given (first, second or third) final, the population of players will, on average,
be less risk averse. At given odds, such players are more likely to continue.
Another way to pick up the effect of potential heterogeneity in risk aversion
is to split the complete sample into a subsample containing third finals only
and a subsample containing first and second finals only. People who enter the
final for the third day in a row must have lost on the two previous days. This
could select only those people who are relatively less risk averse than the
average player. However, although the estimates of y for third finalists in
Tables 6 and 7 are indeed lower than those for the other subsample, the
difference is not significant.
Similarly, teams with a higher initial stake Wo tend to continue longer than
implied by the expected-utility model and the extensions we considered. Wo is
even significant for the model with heterogeneity in ability. An explanation
might be that players that enter with a high Wo are relatively more overconfident. Hence, despite that, on average, they continue longer because of
better survival chances, this may be strengthened further because they overestimate their odds to a larger extent. However, the data do not support this
explanation. When we estimate the decision weights model for the two
subsamples based on Wo, the estimates of the parameters in (17) are not
significantly different between the subsamples.

6.5. Simulation
By simulating the model, we can compare additional implications of the
estimated decision rule with the actual data from the game. This provides an
extra check on the estimated decision rule. We simulate the model by
repeatedly drawing an initial stake Wo from its empirical distribution. Starting
with Wo, the first round of the game is played. We simulate how many
and which balls players draw from the urn, which determines whether they
lose or proceed to the second round. After updating the survival probability,
the estimated decision rule determines whether players continue or stop.
The procedure continues until players stop, lose, or win all five rounds of the
final.19
Simulation is most straightforward for third finals, since players have no
possibility of returning in future shows. Repeating the simulation 500,000

times, we record the distribution of the gains in the final (W1) and the
percentage of STOPPERS, LOSERS and WJNNERS.Simulation results for the
third final using the basic expected-utility model are given in Table 11. The
simulated data closely corresponds with the actual distribution of STOPPERS,
LOSERSand WINNERSin the sample. The simulated gains are higher than the
actual W1, although well within a two-standard-error range. It appears that our
model does not systematically make wrong predictions about the circumstances in which players will stop or play.
The most interesting result from the simulations is that they allow us to
compute the option value a2 endogenously. When players lose in a second
final, they are allowed to come back in one more show. From the average
utility of the simulated money gains, we find the certainty equivalent
a2 = 1,402. Analogously, for the sample of losers in the second final, the
certainty equivalent of the average utility of their money gains gives an estimate
of a2 equal to 1,423, which is very close to the simulated value. Both are less
than the estimated parameter value a2 = 1,523 in Table 7, which means that
players either overestimate their winning chances or attach value to being
allowed to appear in a television game one more time.20
7. Conclusions
One of the main problems in economics is the assessment of individuals' risk
attitudes. In this paper, we have used a new and unique dataset, obtained from
the Dutch televison game show LINGO, to estimate the degree of risk aversion
of its players. LINGO provides an excellent natural experiment for this purpose:
the players' decisions are simple (stop or continue), the dataset is large and
the money stakes are high.
Our main findings are the following. First, using our basic expected-utility
framework, we found clear evidence of risk aversion (although less than what
is needed to explain the equity-premium puzzle), both for our complete

sample of finalists and for third finalists only (ie, the group that might be
expected to be the least risk averse). Based on our initial wealth estimate of
f50,000, we estimate the coefficient of relative risk aversion at approximately 7.
The implied willingness to engage in an elementary lottery depends on the size
of the stake: the required minimum probability of winning in a lottery in which
the stake is either doubled or everything is lost rises from 53% for a stake of
f1,000 to 73% for a stake of f8,000.
The second main finding is that, for plausible generalisations of our basic
framework, the estimated degree of risk aversion increases. One extension is to
allow for the players' utility not only to depend on the money gains but also on
the act of playing itself (e.g., players just enjoy playing these types of games or
they like to be on television).21 Another extension is to allow decisions to be
based on decision weights rather than the actual probabilities. In accordance
with empirical findings in other contexts, the estimates suggest that players
display a strong tendency to overestimate their chances of success. This could
most likely be attributed to an overestimation of the ability to solve word
puzzles. To explain the stop decisions in the data with this model, the
estimated risk aversion needs to increase.

Appendix: Additional Details of the Game
Cluesfor Guessingthe Word:Whenever a couple has to guess a new word, two letters
(and their positions in the word) are alreadygiven. If some attempt yields one or more
additional letters that feature in the word, then these letters are also indicated. It is also
indicated whether the position of these letters within the word is correct or not. Using
this information, words can usuallybe found in a small number of attempts.
Thejackpot:In the pre-final, there is also a 'jackpot', which increases by f50 after
each correctly guessed word. After each word they solve, a couple can draw two balls,
without replacement, from an urn containing green and red balls (this is a different
urn from the one used in the final). The jackpot accumulates over the shows until
some couple has drawn a total of three green balls in a given pre-final. This couple
receives the amount in the jackpot, which startsat zero again. Thus, the starting value
of the jackpot in some given pre-final is the jackpot value at the end of the previous
pre-final.Gains from the jackpot are not at risk in the final. However,when the jackpot
has risen to a high value, this may provide an incentive to continue longer in the final,
because the failure to survive this final (if it is not the third final) yields another
attempt at the jackpot in the next pre-final.
21 Another reason, not
investigated here, why our baseline risk-aversion estimates may understate
players' true risk aversion is the 'gambling with the house money effect' (Thaler and Johnson, 1990):
players are not yet accustomed to the money they have won so far and are, therefore, more willing to
bet their stakes.
