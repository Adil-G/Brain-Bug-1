E

vidence suggests that consumers often hesitate to transact with Web-based vendors because of uncertainty about vendor behavior or the perceived risk of having personal
information stolen by hackers. Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice—behaviors essential to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is critical to both researchers and
practitioners. Prior research on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and inconsistent deﬁnitions of trust, making it difﬁcult to compare results across studies. This paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary, multidimensional
model of trust in e-commerce. The model includes four high-level constructs—disposition to
trust, institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions—which are further delineated into 16 measurable, literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties
of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical, legal advice Web site. The
results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among
the trust constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as are relationships between
the trust constructs and three other e-commerce constructs (for external nomological validity)—Web experience, personal innovativeness, and Web site quality. Suggestions for future
research as well as implications for practice are discussed.

Introduction
“The trust factor opens up or closes down the pace and nature
of electronic commerce growth. . . . Trust is so multifaceted.
. . . What exactly is trust? It’s so easy to talk about, so hard to
pin down.—Keen et al. (1999)

The Internet promises to revolutionize the shopping
and information-gathering choices available to consumers. However, the enormous potential of B2C commerce

(Wang et al. 1998) can only be realized if consumers feel
comfortable transacting over the new medium with unfamiliar vendors (Gefen and Straub 2002). Yet, “almost
95% of consumers have declined to provide personal
information to Web sites”—63% of these indicated this
is “because they do not ‘trust’ those collecting the data”
(Hoffman et al. 1999, p. 82). This suggests that consumer
decisions to adopt B2C commerce involve not only

perceptions of the technology (e.g., perceived usefulness and ease of use; Davis et al. 1989), but also beliefs
about the e-vendor (Friedman et al. 2000). Lack of trust
in Web vendors can deter consumer adoption of ecommerce (Bhattacherjee 2002). Similarly, the perceived
risk of having one’s personal identity or ﬁnancial information stolen by hackers (O’Brien 2000) can deter Web
site use. Thus, a lack of trust in the technical and institutional environments surrounding the Web can also
hinder e-commerce adoption. Because Internet social
cues are minimal, trust is difﬁcult to establish (Gefen
and Straub 2002). Web vendors must act purposefully
to overcome consumer perceptions of uncertainty and
risk by building trust—both in their own Web sites and
in the broader Internet environment. Understanding the
nature and antecedents of trust is, therefore, a major
issue for both Internet researchers and practitioners
(e.g., Fox 2000, Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky 1999, Stewart
1999).
Trust has traditionally been difﬁcult to deﬁne and
measure (Rousseau et al. 1998). Researchers have
called the state of trust deﬁnitions a “confusing potpourri” (Shapiro 1987, p. 625), a “conceptual confusion” (Lewis and Weigert 1985, p. 975), and even a
“conceptual morass” (Barber 1983, p. 1; Carnevale and
Wechsler 1992, p. 473). Although some researchers
have treated trust as a unitary concept (e.g., Rotter
1971), most now agree that trust is multidimensional
(Mayer et al. 1995, Rousseau et al. 1998). Yet there is
little agreement on the speciﬁc dimensions that constitute trust and little research on how the dimensions
interrelate. Keen et al. (1999) noted that, “. . . the basic
conclusion in all these ﬁelds [is] trust is becoming more
and more important, but we still can’t really say what
it exactly is” (pp. 4–5). For years, trust researchers have
called for conceptual clarity (Golembiewski and
McConkie 1975, Kee and Knox 1970) but with little success (Wrightsman 1991). This lack of clarity is also seen
in research on Web trust, in which diverse and inconsistent deﬁnitions of trust make it difﬁcult to compare
results across studies. Some e-commerce researchers
have deﬁned trust as a belief in an attribute of the
trustee (Menon et al. 1999, Stewart 1999), whereas others have deﬁned trust as a willingness to believe the
trustee (Fung and Lee 1999). Some researchers have
not provided a conceptual deﬁnition (Hoffman et al.
Information Systems Research
Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2002

1999). Research progresses more quickly when constructs are well deﬁned and measures correspond to
conceptual deﬁnitions (Kaplan 1964, Schwab 1980).
This article contributes by developing and validating an instrument to measure a literature-grounded,
cross-disciplinary typology of trust constructs that apply to the Web context. Validating instruments adds
value in multiple ways (Straub 1989)—(a) it brings
more rigor to research and allows research to be conducted in a more systematic manner; (b) it “promotes
cooperative research efforts” (p. 148); (c) it makes research results more interpretable and clear; and (d) it
helps assure that research results are valid or “can be
trusted” (p. 148).
The cross-disciplinary nature of the trust typology
in this study highlights the multiple, interrelated dimensions of e-commerce trust. Thus, trust, as a willingness to depend on a vendor to deliver on commitments, is not the same as trust as a belief that the
vendor uses consumer data ethically, or the same as
trust as a perception that the Internet is technologically
secure. Each trust type has different implications for
consumer behavior and for how trust is built. Therefore, it is important to distinguish among the multiple
dimensions of trust.

Theory
Trust is important because it helps consumers overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engage
in “trust-related behaviors” with Web-based vendors,
such as sharing personal information or making purchases. These perceptions may be especially salient
when interacting with an unfamiliar vendor. Thus, a
particularly critical form of trust in e-commerce may
be a user’s initial trust in a Web vendor. This paper
focuses on initial trust.
Initial trust (McKnight et al. 1998) refers to trust in
an unfamiliar trustee, a relationship in which the actors
do not yet have credible, meaningful information
about, or affective bonds with, each other (Bigley and
Pierce 1998). Credible information is gleaned after parties have interacted for some time. In e-commerce, we
posit that credible information is gained only after the
truster (i.e., a Web user) has both engaged in trustrelated behaviors (e.g., disclosing personal information) and assessed the “trustworthiness” of the vendor

335

<-----Page 2----->McKNIGHT, CHOUDHURY, AND KACMAR
Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce

by observing the consequences of those behaviors. The
period during which a consumer visits and explores a
vendor’s Web site for the ﬁrst time (the focus of this
study) is clearly within the domain of initial trust. We
apply an initial trust model because Web vendors need
to engender sufﬁcient trust to persuade ﬁrst-time consumers to transact with them. In initial relationships,
people use whatever information they have, such as
perceptions of a Web site, to make trust inferences
(McKnight et al. 1998).
The focus on initial trust also reﬂects our assumptions about how trusting beliefs form. The cognitivebased trust literature posits that trusting beliefs may
form quickly (before parties have meaningful information about each other) because of social categorization, reputation, illusions (irrational thinking), disposition, institutional roles and structures, or out of the
need to immediately cooperate on a task (McKnight et
al. 1998, Meyerson et al. 1996). The knowledge-based
trust literature (Blau 1964, Ring and Van de Ven 1994),
on the other hand, indicates that trust develops gradually through experiential social exchange (Lewicki
and Bunker 1995, Shapiro et al. 1992). The model of
initial trust proposed in this paper adopts the assumptions of the cognitive-based literature, based on our
conviction that people form trusting beliefs early, but
that these may change as people gain experience with
the trustee.
Deﬁnitions and Models of Trust
Various types of trust have been proposed (Butler
1991, Cummings and Bromiley 1996, Mayer et al.
1995). Most researchers have deﬁned trust according
to their speciﬁc disciplinary worldview. Psychologists
deﬁne trust as a tendency to trust others (Rotter 1971).
Social psychologists deﬁne trust as a cognition about
the trustee (Rempel et al. 1985). Sociologists deﬁne
trust as a characteristic of the institutional environment. Many variants of the above types exist, including a signiﬁcant number in e-commerce research
(McKnight et al. 2001–2002).
The confusing proliferation of trust types has
prompted some researchers to develop composite trust
deﬁnitions (e.g., Doney et al. 1998, Kee and Knox 1970,
Mayer et al. 1995). For instance, Kee and Knox (1970)
deﬁned a set of ﬁve trust-related constructs: dispositional factors, situational factors, perceptions of the

336

other, subjective trust, and behavioral trust. Mayer et
al. (1995) included propensity to trust, trust (willingness to be vulnerable to another), and perceptions of
trustworthiness (cognitions). What these models have
in common is some combination of trusting dispositions, cognitions, and willingness/intentions.
In this paper, we build on the integrative model proposed by McKnight et al. (1998), because it includes
institution-based trust as well as the more common
trust types—trusting intentions, trusting beliefs, and
disposition to trust. This model was also chosen because it includes measurement-level subconstructs.
Following McKnight et al. (1998), we integrate these
trust constructs within the broad framework of the
Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Fishbein and Ajzen
1975) (Figure 1). TRA posits that beliefs lead to attitudes, which lead to behavioral intentions, which lead
to the behavior itself. Davis et al. (1989) found that
attitudes fell out of the model empirically, making
their model more parsimonious. Applying this more
parsimonious version of TRA, we posit that trusting
beliefs (perceptions of speciﬁc Web vendor attributes)
lead to trusting intentions (intention to engage in trustrelated behaviors with a speciﬁc Web vendor), which
in turn result in trust-related behaviors (extending
McKnight et al.).
We further posit institution-based trust and disposition to trust as antecedents to trusting beliefs/intentions. Institution-based trust is the sociological dimension of trust. It refers to an individual’s perceptions of
the institutional environment—in this case, the Internet. Perceptions of the structural characteristics of the
Internet, such as safety and security, can inﬂuence
trusting beliefs and trusting intentions towards a speciﬁc vendor (Keen et al. 1999). Disposition to trust means
a general propensity to trust others, which can also
inﬂuence an individual’s beliefs and intentions towards a Web-based vendor and is, therefore, important to include in the model.
We discuss individual elements of the model in
greater detail below.
Trust-Related Behaviors. Trust-related behaviors are
actions that demonstrate dependence on a Web vendor, that make one vulnerable to the vendor, or increase one’s risk (Mayer et al. 1995, Zand 1972). Numerous researchers have conceptualized trust as a

behavior (e.g., Anderson and Narus 1990, Deutsch
1973, Fox 1974). Commonly discussed trust-related behaviors in electronic commerce include sharing personal information, making a purchase, or acting on information provided by a Web site. Because of the
difﬁculty of asking subjects to undertake such behavior, we did not measure actual behavior in this study.
Instead, we measured trusting intentions, that is, intention to engage in trust-related behaviors with the
Web vendor. This is not uncommon in TRA-based
studies of technology acceptance (e.g., Agarwal and
Prasad 1998, Karahanna et al. 1999, Venkatesh 1999,
2000). Prior research has conﬁrmed a strong correlation between behavioral intentions and actual behavior
(Sheppard et al. 1988, Venkatesh and Davis 2000).
Trusting Intentions: Intention to Engage in TrustRelated Behaviors. Trusting intentions means the
truster is securely willing to depend, or intends to depend, on the trustee. Willingness to depend (volitional
preparedness to make oneself vulnerable to the
trustee) and subjective probability of depending (the perceived likelihood that one will depend on the other)
form two distinct subconstructs of trusting intentions.
Subjective probability of depending is the more concrete subconstruct, going beyond a stated willingness
to rely on another to stated intentions of relying on
them in speciﬁc ways. For example, Currall and Judge
(1995), deﬁning trust as a subjective probability of depending, measured the probability that one would
Information Systems Research
Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2002

share information with the other person. On the Web,
a consumer would have willingness to depend if they
agree to general statements about volitional preparedness to rely on the vendor. We propose that consumer
subjective probability of depending involves the projected intention to engage in three speciﬁc risky behaviors—provide the vendor personal information, engage in a purchase transaction, or act on vendor
information (e.g., ﬁnancial advice).
Trusting Beliefs: Perceptions of Speciﬁc Web Vendor Attributes. Trusting beliefs means the conﬁdent
truster perception that the trustee—in this context, a
speciﬁc Web-based vendor—has attributes that are
beneﬁcial to the truster. Although many types exist in
the literature (e.g., Butler 1991), three trusting beliefs
are utilized most often (Bhattacherjee 2002, Gefen 1997,
Mayer et al. 1995): competence (ability of the trustee to
do what the truster needs), benevolence (trustee caring
and motivation to act in the truster’s interests), and
integrity (trustee honesty and promise keeping).
These three beliefs were included based on a categorization of trusting beliefs in 32 trust articles or
books. Fifteen types of trusting beliefs were found (Table 1). Because the difference between many of the
types was small, we used conceptual clustering to
group them into categories. We then picked the three
that appeared most frequently and seemed most relevant. Thus, the ﬁrst three columns in Table 1 relate to

Notes: Benevolence includes favorable motives and not acting opportunistically or manipulatively. Although most of the authors of these sources define
trust as a belief or an expectancy, the definitions of Baier (1986), Giffin (1967), and Husted (1990) are stated in terms of behaviors or actions. Morality
includes goodness. Integrity includes honesty and sincerity. Competence includes ability, capability, and good judgment. Predictability includes consistency.
Carefulness includes keeping confidences safe. Attraction refers to Personal Attraction. Dynamism is used in the context of public speaking.
Coding Examples:
Ring and Van de Ven 1994: p. 93—“. . .a view (of trust) based on confidence in another’s goodwill [coded as goodwill]. . .faith in the moral integrity [coded
as morality]. . .of others. . . . ;” Sitkin and Roth 1993, p. 373—“The model assigns the term ‘trust’ to refer to belief in a person’s competence [coded as
competence] to perform a specific task under specific circumstances. . . . ;” Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994, p. 132—“Trust is. . .an expectation of goodwill
and benign intent [coded as goodwill].”

some kind of trustee capability. To be responsive and
to have goodwill toward another is similar to trustee
benevolence (Columns 4–6). Integrity, implying one is
ethical, overlaps conceptually with morality and credibility, and with reliability and dependability to the
extent that they have ethical overtones (Columns 7–
11). Both integrity and benevolence reﬂect ethical
traits. However, benevolence refers to trustee motives
and is based on altruism (Mayer et al. 1995), whereas
integrity refers to keeping commitments and not lying
(implying reliability), traits that may be held for utilitarian, rather than altruistic, reasons. Openness, carefulness, and attractiveness were excluded from the
model because few instances (Columns 13–15) were
found. We also excluded predictability because it has
to do with consistency, which is more relevant to an
ongoing trust model than to an initial trust model.
The distinctions among belief types are important.
Consider an e-vendor of music CDs versus a Web provider of medical information. The latter should be
more concerned with consumer beliefs about competence than the former, because the risk from lack of
“performance” is higher for the medical information
consumer. On the other hand, the CD vendor requires
disclosure of personal information, so consumers may
be more concerned about vendor benevolence and integrity. The distinction is also important because the
effects of third-party endorsements may differ. An endorsement from a professional association (e.g., the
American Medical Association for a medical Web site)
may promote high competence beliefs, whereas an endorsement from the Better Business Bureau (BBB)
should inﬂuence integrity beliefs.
Institution-Based Trust: Perceptions of the Internet
Environment. Institution-based trust is the belief that
needed structural conditions are present (e.g., in the
Internet) to enhance the probability of achieving a successful outcome in an endeavor like e-commerce.
Institution-based trust comes from sociology,1 which
1
Some sociologists (e.g., Shapiro 1987) are concerned only with objective, behavioral institutional characteristics. Others research behavioral characteristics, but measure perceptions as proxies for the
behaviors (e.g., Burt and Knez 1996). Finally, some (e.g., Barber 1983)
research perceptions related to institutional characteristics. We view
institution-based trust largely in perceptual terms, because we believe that, on the Web, perceptions ultimately determine trusting
beliefs and trusting intentions.

Information Systems Research
Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2002

deals with the structures (e.g., legal protections) that
make an environment feel trustworthy (e.g., the United
States immigrant culture of the 1800s, Zucker 1986).
Just as legal systems of justice and protection took time
to set up in the “wild, wild west” of 19th-century
America, so procedures and structures of security and
protection are now being established in the “wild, wild
Web” of the 21st century. Technological and legal safeguards that produce institution-based trust are as important to the Web consumer as was the quickdrawing sheriff who produced the security of
institution-based trust for an 1850s frontier settlement.
Two dimensions of institution-based trust are deﬁned: structural assurance and situational normality.
Structural assurance means one believes that structures
like guarantees, regulations, promises, legal recourse,
or other procedures are in place to promote success
(Shapiro 1987, Zucker 1986). For example, one with
high Web-related structural assurance would believe
that legal and technological Internet protections like
data encryption safeguard one from loss of privacy,
identity, or money. Situational normality means one believes that the environment is in proper order and success is likely because the situation is normal or favorable (Baier 1986, Garﬁnkel 1963, Lewis and Weigert
1985). A consumer who perceives high situational normality would believe the Internet environment is appropriate, well ordered, and favorable for doing personal business. They would believe that, in general,
vendors in the environment have the attributes: competence, benevolence, and integrity.
The distinction between trusting beliefs about a speciﬁc vendor and institution-based trust is important.
Third-party icons that address general security may
enhance perceptions about the Internet, but not beliefs
about a speciﬁc vendor. On the other hand, an icon
from an entity such as BBB may inﬂuence a customer’s
trusting beliefs in a speciﬁc vendor, but may do nothing to appease the consumer’s uneasiness about the
general security of the Web.
Disposition to Trust. Disposition to trust is the extent to which a person displays a tendency to be willing to depend on others across a broad spectrum of
situations and persons. We use two subconstructs of
disposition to trust. Faith in humanity means one assumes others are usually upright, well meaning, and

339

<-----Page 6----->McKNIGHT, CHOUDHURY, AND KACMAR
Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce

dependable. Applying the idea that trusting beliefs refer to a speciﬁc person’s integrity, competence, and benevolence, we extend the trust literature by suggesting
that faith in humanity can be decomposed in the same
way. Thus, we posit separate subconstructs for faith in
general others’ competence, benevolence, and integrity.
Trusting stance means that, regardless of what one believes about peoples’ attributes, one assumes better
outcomes result from dealing with people as though
they are well meaning and reliable (McKnight et al.
1998, Riker 1971). Trusting stance, an economic choice
variable, is like the consumer who has a personal strategy to trust vendors until they prove him/her wrong,
whether or not they have worthy characteristics. Faith
in humanity is about attributes of general others; trusting stance is a personal approach to dealing with
others.
Trust-building strategies may be different for individuals with low versus high disposition to trust. For
instance, links to well-known corporate sites may enhance trusting beliefs in the eyes of a consumer with
high disposition to trust, but may alienate one with
low disposition to trust (who may be suspicious of any
trust-building attempts).
Relationships Among Trust Constructs
Figure 2 depicts the subconstructs of, and linkages
among, the trust constructs. Disposition to trust should
inﬂuence trusting beliefs because it tends to color interpretations of the interpersonal relationship at hand.
Gefen (2000) found that disposition to trust inﬂuences
trust in vendors. Similarly, disposition to trust should
positively inﬂuence perceptions of the institutional setting. Figure 2 also shows disposition to trust impacting
trusting intentions directly, but this relation should be
weak because it is largely mediated by trusting beliefs.
The direct effect of disposition to trust on trusting beliefs is likely to be strongest when both the institutional
context and the speciﬁc trustee are unfamiliar to the
truster (Bigley and Pierce 1998, Rotter 1971). If one has
sizeable experience with an institutional context (but
not with a speciﬁc trustee), that experience will directly
inﬂuence institution-based trust, and the impact of disposition to trust on trusting beliefs will be largely mediated by institution-based trust. If a Web user gains
experience with a speciﬁc vendor, the experience may

340

be the dominant inﬂuence on trusting beliefs, instead
of dispositional or institution-based trust.
Institution-based trust is proposed to relate positively to both trusting beliefs and trusting intentions.
When a situation feels safe, we tend to believe that
those in the situation have trustworthy attributes
(McKnight et al. 1998). Thus, a consumer who is comfortable with the Web situation and the security of its
structures is likely to have high trusting beliefs in a
speciﬁc vendor. Similarly, feelings of contextual security entice us to have trusting intentions.
Trusting beliefs will relate positively to trusting intentions because a consumer with high trusting beliefs
perceives the Internet vendor to have attributes that
enable the consumer to hold a secure willingness to
depend on the vendor. Perceptions that the vendor is
honest, for example, encourage the consumer to provide personal information. TRA research also supports
this link, in that beliefs strongly predict corresponding
intentions (Davis et al. 1989).
Relationships with Other e-Commerce Constructs
The Web trust model also needs to be understood in
light of three existing e-commerce constructs: personal
innovativeness, Web experience, and perceived site
quality (Figure 2). Personal innovativeness (Agarwal
and Prasad 1998) is a trait that reﬂects conﬁdence or
optimism regarding adoption of new ideas or technologies. Disposition to trust also reﬂects a general optimism (Uslaner 2000). Furthermore, disposition to trust
allows one to adapt and inﬂuences the ability to learn
new things (Erikson 1968). Hence, disposition to trust
should positively affect personal innovativeness.
One of the most basic of trust-building tenets is that
experience with the object of trust promotes trust in
the object (Blau 1964, Luhmann 1979). This tenet applies to both institution-based trust and trust in the
Web vendor. It suggests that general Web experience
will be positively related to institution-based trust because experience provides the consumer a feeling that
dealing with the Web is proper and normal, which is
represented by situational normality. Also, Web experience will assure most people that the Web is safe,
positively affecting structural assurance.
Perceived Web site quality should relate positively

to both trusting beliefs and trusting intentions because
using the Web site provides the ﬁrst experiential taste
of the vendor’s presence, solidifying initial impressions. People make trust-related assumptions about
others based on whatever they know (McKnight et al.
1998). Therefore, if consumers perceive that the Web
site is of high quality, they will assume that the Web
vendor has positive attributes and will form trusting
intentions. Because experience conquers uncertainty
(Luhmann 1979), site quality leads to trust in the
vendor.

The items used to operationalize the constructs (see the

negatively worded trust items tend to factor separately
into distrust (Wrightsman 1991), which is conceptually
separate from trust (Lewicki et al. 1998, McKnight and
Chervany 2001), we used all positively worded items.
We did not measure trusting behaviors, a limitation
future research should address. For trusting intentions

previously developed and tested (with Cronbach’s alpha ⬎ 0.90) for use in organizations, with items largely
from Dobing (1993). For trusting intentions-subjective
probability of depending, new items were developed
to measure three common trust-related Internet behaviors: provide personal information, buy from the vendor, and follow vendor advice. We felt respondents
would perceive these intentions to embody vulnerability, as the deﬁnition of trusting intentions suggests
(Mayer et al. 1995).
The trusting beliefs items were adapted from scales
reviewed and summarized in Wrightsman (1991), especially Johnson-George and Swap (1982) and Rempel
et al. (1985). In selecting items, we tried to capture the
aspects of the belief that were most relevant to the Web
context. Thus, for competence, we measured perceptions of how well the vendor did its job or how knowledgeable the vendor was (expertness/competence).
We excluded dynamism (as a speaker), because it is
not relevant to the Internet. The integrity items captured perceptions of vendor honesty, truthfulness, sincerity, and keeping commitments (reliability/dependability). Finally, the benevolence items focused on the
vendor acting in the customer’s best interest, trying to
help, and being genuinely concerned.
No speciﬁc structural assurance or situational normality items were located. Typically, sociologists have
either observed this kind of trust or, in Garﬁnkel’s
(1963) case, experimentally created it.2 We developed
situational normality items to capture the same three
dimensions—competence, benevolence, and integrity—
by adapting the trusting beliefs items to reﬂect perceptions about Web vendors in general (instead of a speciﬁc
Web vendor). For structural assurance, we utilized terms
like “safeguards,” “protect,” “robust,” and “encryption” to refer to the structures making the Web safe.
As with trusting beliefs, we dimensionalized faith in
humanity into competence, benevolence, and integrity.
Existing items were adapted from scales compiled in
Wrightsman (1991). The items refer to attributes of people in general, distinguishing them from beliefs about a
speciﬁc Web-based vendor. No items corresponding to

the deﬁnition of trusting stance were found, so we created a new scale for this subconstruct with three items.
Nontrust items were adapted from existing scales:
Agarwal and Prasad (1998) for personal innovativeness and Cheskin (1999) for perceived site quality. Web
experience was operationalized as the frequency of use
of Web newspapers, news groups, information on
products, and shopping, based on Georgia Institute of
Technology’s Graphics, Visualization, and Usability

Although such instruments are sometimes called surveys, following
Boudreau et al. (2001), we suggest referring to instruments used during experiments as questionnaires (or experimental instruments) and
reserving the term surveys for the context of ﬁeld studies.

In a similar vein, Gefen (1997) used a PC Magazine Editors’ Choice
award (with permission from the publisher) as an imprimatur for
the hypothetical freeware that was being used as his experimental
stimulus.

Data Collection
Data for the study were collected through questionnaires3 administered in the context of an experiment.
The speciﬁc setting for the study, a created artifact of
a legal advice site, was devised for two reasons. First,
a growing number of sites offer advice to consumers
in such sensitive ﬁelds as law and medicine. These sites
introduce an interesting aspect of trust—whether or
not the user is willing to act on the advice such Web
sites provide. Second, trust becomes more salient as
the level of risk to the consumer increases. Acting on
legal advice from a Web site entails much more longterm personal risk (i.e., potential legal liability) than
does, for example, buying a music CD online.
The subjects began by completing a questionnaire
that included measures of disposition to trust,
institution-based trust, Web experience, and personal
innovativeness. Subjects were then told that they have
a malfunctioning air-conditioner in their apartment
but, after repeated calls to the landlord, it has not been
ﬁxed. They were asked to investigate their legal rights
in this situation by visiting a legal advice Web site for
which they had seen an advertisement in the local
newspaper. After the subjects explored the Web site to
ﬁnd the relevant information, they answered questions
about their trusting beliefs/intentions and perceived
site quality. The entire study was conducted online.
Subjects for the study were undergraduate and
graduate students at three large universities. Two pilot

tests (n⳱71 and 80) provided feedback to make improvements (mostly minor) to the items. For the ﬁnal
sample, 1,729 subjects participated; 1,403 responses
(81%) were usable. To ensure that respondents had sufﬁcient Web experience, 1,141 of the 1,403 respondents
were from a university-wide required computer literacy class that delivered course materials on the Web.
The other respondents were information systems majors. The incentive for participating was extra credit
(0.8 to 2% of the course grade). Table 2 provides respondent demographics.
The use of student subjects has sometimes been
questioned on grounds of external validity (Gordon et
al. 1986). However, multiple reasons suggest that, in
this case, the use of student subjects does not present
a signiﬁcant threat to validity. First, students are sometimes considered poor surrogates for the “real world”
because they are asked to imagine themselves in an
organizational context (e.g., as a CEO). This study does
not require an imagined organizational context.
Rather, consumer electronic commerce is an individual
decision-making situation. Second, students are often
asked to respond to questions about situations that are
both unrealistic and completely unfamiliar (e.g., the
hiring or ﬁring of employees or the acquisition of companies). In this study, respondents were familiar with
the Web, averaging almost four years of Web experience. Online consumers are generally younger and
more highly educated than conventional consumers,
which makes student samples closer to the online consumer population (OECD 1998).
Third, the problem presented to the subjects (landlord/tenant dispute) was speciﬁcally designed for a
student population. Because most students are or have
been directly involved with tenant issues, they can

identify with the situation of a failed air-conditioning
unit and responsibility for repairs. The act of seeking
legal advice may not be as familiar, but here too individuals must often turn to the Web to seek information
on unfamiliar situations.
Fourth, to ensure that the students took the experiment seriously, they were informed by course instructors that special software would be deployed to
“grade” selected responses (the questionnaire asked
students about the content of the advice they had
read). They were told that the percentage of extra
credit awarded would be based on the number of correct responses. Although this was not enforced, it enhanced the probability that students would take the
study seriously. Students did not know it was not enforced until after all data were collected. The pilot
studies indicated that approximately 25–35 minutes
were needed to complete the study. Results indicated
an average response time of 29.3 minutes, afﬁrming
that the subjects took the task seriously. In addition,
we tested whether the subjects had skipped any aspect
of the study or had essentially circled the same number. Cases that failed on these points were discarded.
The length and quality of responses to several qualitative questions also enhanced the researchers’ conﬁdence that respondents were serious about the study.
As Lynch (1999) has noted: “Findings from single
real-world settings and speciﬁc sets of ‘real’ people are
no more likely to generalize than are ﬁndings from
single laboratory settings with student subjects. Just as
in the laboratory, the real world varies in background
facets of subject characteristics, setting, context, relevant history, and time” (p. 368). That is, because any
sample involves subjects with speciﬁc attributes, results from a single real-world study may not generalize to the broader population, with diverse characteristics, any better than results from a single study using
student subjects. Ultimately, complete generalizability
must be established by replication in multiple settings
with multiple samples.
Because the experiment was conducted over a period of several weeks, one thing we were not able to
prevent was subjects talking to each other about the
study, or what Cook and Campbell (1979) refer to as
the threat of “compensatory rivalry.” We felt that telling students not to discuss the study might have

343

<-----Page 10----->McKNIGHT, CHOUDHURY, AND KACMAR
Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce

drawn more attention to the issue. Thus, to verify ex
post whether this was a problem, we performed
means-difference tests to compare the responses from
subjects completing the study at an earlier date to responses from those who completed the study later. The
rationale was that any systematic biases introduced by
students discussing the study would be reﬂected in
signiﬁcant differences among the variables. The sample was divided into six cells, representing each of the
six weeks within the study period. An analysis of variance was performed on the dependent variables using
the week number (1–6) as the independent, categorical
variable. No signiﬁcant differences were found on the
major dependent variables.4

Analysis
Data analysis took place in three phases, as described
below. In the process, we analyzed three types of validity: convergent, discriminant, and nomological. Together, these types of validity constitute construct validity, or “the extent to which an operationalization
measures the concept it is supposed to measure”
(Bagozzi et al. 1991, p. 421). Convergent validity means
the extent to which the measures for a variable act as
if they are measuring the underlying theoretical construct because they share variance (Schwab 1980). Internal consistency reliability is generally considered a
necessary, but not sufﬁcient, condition for convergent
validity (Schwab 1980). Discriminant validity means
the degree to which measures of two constructs are
empirically distinct (Bagozzi et al. 1991, Davis 1989).
Nomological validity refers to whether the construct
performs as expected within its nomological network
(Schwab 1980), such as relating to other constructs as
theory suggests (Boudreau et al. 2001, Webster and
Martocchio 1992).
Phase 1: Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
In the ﬁrst phase, exploratory, principal components
factor analysis and internal consistency reliability analysis were conducted to determine the extent to which
the high-level trust constructs were discriminant. Our
objective with the PCA was to cull out items that did

The signiﬁcance level for the overall F-statistic was 0.29, whereas
the p values for the individual constructs ranged from 0.13 to 0.84.

344

not load on the appropriate high-level construct
(Churchill 1979). The PCA was performed using an
oblique rotation for theoretical reasons. McKnight et
al. (1998) argued that these trust constructs form a
model of causally linked variables, which implies positive correlations. Mayer et al. (1995) also argued the
relatedness of dispositional, belief, and intentional
trust constructs. Orthogonal rotation assumes constructs are not correlated. Thus, if theory predicts the
constructs are correlated, as is the case here, it is less
appropriate to use an orthogonal rotation (Kerlinger
1986, McDonald 1985). More interpretable factors result with an oblique rotation (Dillon and Goldstein
1984). Because theory did not suggest a speciﬁc degree
of obliqueness, the SPSS default degree of rotation
(delta value of zero) was used.
Phase 2: Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
The second phase was a CFA, using Structural Equation Modeling to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the latent subconstructs (e.g., competence, benevolence, and integrity) within each of the
four high-level trust constructs (disposition to trust,
institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting
intentions). We conducted this analysis by creating a
LISREL 8.3 path diagram for each construct (Figures
3–6), its constituent subconstructs, and their items. We
applied the following indices and standards to assess
model ﬁt: goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI) and normed ﬁt
index (NFI) greater than 0.90, adjusted goodness-of-ﬁt
index (AGFI) greater than 0.80 (Gefen et al. 2000), comparative ﬁt index (CFI) greater than 0.90 (Jiang and
Klein 1999/2000), and root mean square of approximation (RMSEA) lower than 0.08 for a good ﬁt and
lower than 0.05 for an excellent ﬁt (Browne and
Cudeck 1992). The RMSEA is particularly well suited
to determining the number of latent subconstructs in
a construct because it decreases when an additional
sub-construct reduces the F0 (minimal population discrepancy function) substantially, but increases, showing poorer model ﬁt, if including the additional subconstruct only reduces F0 slightly (Steiger and Lind
1980). Thus, it is used to provide guidance on the number of optimal subconstructs to use (Lievens and Van
Keer 2001), which was central to our objective of conﬁrming the constituent dimensions of the high-level
trust constructs.

Convergent validity was assessed using three criteria: individual item lambda coefﬁcients greater than
0.70, a signiﬁcant (0.05 level) t statistic for each path
(Gefen et al. 2000), and each path loading greater than
twice its standard error (Anderson and Gerbing 1988).
Discriminant validity among the latent variables is
shown without question if the intercorrelations are less
than 0.60 (Carlson et al. 2000). Because this was not
always the case, two additional analyses were conducted. First, a more detailed discriminant validity test
was performed using a constrained analysis method
(Sharma 2000), which involves setting the correlation
between one pair of variables (e.g., benevolence and
integrity in the case of disposition to trust) to unity
(1.0) and running the model again. A v2 difference test
is used to compare the results from the constrained
and original models (Anderson and Gerbing 1988).
Discriminant validity is evidenced if the v2 difference
is signiﬁcant (supporting the original model). Second,
following Gefen et al. (2000), we ran alternate models
in which we combined two (or more) latent subconstructs into one and compared the resulting v2’s to
that of the original model (with the subconstructs modeled separately). If the v2 difference test shows the
original model to be a better ﬁt, discriminant validity
among the subconstructs is established.

Phase 3: Second-Order Models
In the third phase, we used second-order models (using LISREL 8.3) to analyze cross-construct relationships and reafﬁrm discriminant validity among the
constructs. This analysis was performed at both the
item and scale levels to ensure cross-validation and interpretation of results. We assessed internal nomological validity by testing proposed relationships among
the trust constructs themselves, and external nomological validity by examining relationships between the
trust constructs and other e-commerce variables (Figure 2).
Finally, we were able to leverage our large sample
size to provide greater conﬁdence in the results. The
sample was divided approximately in half by randomly selecting cases. The randomly selected sample
(n⳱724) was used in the tests, with the remaining
items (n⳱679) used as a hold-out sample for conﬁrmation testing.

through an exploratory, principal components factor
analysis (PCA) with SPSS 9.0 direct oblimin rotation,
as described above. We were primarily looking for
problem items—those whose loading on the intended
construct was lower than one or more cross-loadings.
No problem items were found; in fact, no items had
cross-loadings above 0.4 (Boudreau et al. 2001, Hair et
al. 1998) on the “wrong” trust construct.
We then examined the factor structure within each
high-level trust construct. Ten factors with eigenvalues
above 1.0 resulted. Disposition to trust formed three
factors, with no cross-loadings above 0.4. Faith in
humanity-benevolence and faith in humanity-integrity
factored together. Institution-based trust split by situational normality and structural assurance. One item
from the situational normality factor had a crossloading of ⳮ0.42 on structural assurance, but this
cross-loading was still much lower than the loading of
the item on the main factor (⬎0.60). Furthermore,
dropping the item did not improve the reliability of
this subconstruct. Therefore, the item was retained.
The trusting beliefs items all loaded strongly together into a single factor. A second analysis was performed using just the items forming trusting beliefs
and specifying the number of factors based on theory
(Fabrigar et al. 1999, Wayne and Liden 1995). When a
two-factor solution was speciﬁed, competence belief
split cleanly from benevolence and integrity beliefs.
When a three-factor solution was speciﬁed, all items
loaded by the types in the model, with loadings above
0.55 on the intended subconstruct and cross-loadings
below 0.4. Thus, no items were changed.
Trusting intention formed three well-deﬁned factors: intention to make purchases, intention to follow
advice/willingness to depend, and intention to give
personal information. The only cross-loading above 0.4
was the second item for Give Information (GI), which
loaded at 0.42 on willingness to make purchases. Factor 10 consisted of weak loadings from items for trusting intention-willingness to depend, indicating that
this subconstruct may not have been fully captured by
the “intention to follow advice/willingness to depend”
factor noted here. Once again, a second analysis was
conducted using just the items designed to measure
trusting intention. Initially, we obtained the same three
factors as described, with no cross-loadings above 0.4.

346

When a four-factor solution was speciﬁed, trusting intentions split cleanly into the four subconstructs in the
model. However, one item that was designed to measure willingness to follow advice loaded instead on the
factor willingness to depend. Examining this item suggested that it had been worded to be closer to willingness to depend. Thus, this item was reassigned for the
CFA. We again found that the second item designed
to measure GI had a cross-loading of 0.40 and a relatively low loading of 0.49. However, the item was retained because the cross loading was lower than the
loading, and because reliability analysis showed that
dropping this item only improved the alpha for GI
from 0.70 to 0.73.
Next, internal consistency reliability analyses were
conducted, using Cronbach’s alphas. Table 3A reports
results based on the factor pattern in the PCA, and
Table 3B reports alphas based on more detailed breakdowns. All constructs are reliable by Nunnally’s (1978)
heuristics.
Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis
Disposition to Trust. Figure 3 shows the results of
the CFA analysis of the disposition to trust part of the
model. With GFI, NFI, and CFI statistics above 0.9,
AGFI above 0.8, and an RMSEA below 0.08, model ﬁt
was good. Convergent validity for each of the four subconstructs is shown by the criteria discussed above—
the item lambda coefﬁcients were above 0.70 (0.73–
0.92), each path was signiﬁcant (t values between 21.4
and 31.0), and each path loading was greater than
twice its associated standard error (0.035–0.058).
Five of the six pairs of latent variables passed the
discriminant validity test, with intercorrelations less
than 0.60. However, benevolence and integrity were
highly correlated (0.69). Thus, the two additional tests
for discriminant validity described previously were
conducted. We ran six different constrained models,
each time setting to unity the correlation between one
pair of the four subconstructs. For all six pairs, the v2
was signiﬁcant (p ⬍ 0.01), supporting discriminant validity. We then ran a model combining the two subconstructs of benevolence and integrity. The model ﬁt
indicators worsened signiﬁcantly (RMSEA⳱0.10). The

v2 difference test conﬁrmed (p ⬍ 0.01) that the four subconstruct model is a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt. Models
with other combinations of subconstructs were also
tested, but in each case the model ﬁt was signiﬁcantly
worse (0.16 ⬍ RMSEA ⬍ 0.19) than the original model,
as conﬁrmed through v2 difference tests.

results for institution-based trust. The model ﬁt was

above: all path t values (24.7–34.5) were signiﬁcant, the

and each path loading was greater than twice its standard error (0.034–0.054).
Discriminant validity among the subconstructs
could not be assured by reviewing the intercorrelations, which were each greater than 0.60. Thus,
we ran multiple models, constraining the correlations
between subconstructs to 1.00—for all pairs, the v2 difference was signiﬁcant (p ⬍ 0.01). We then ran multiple
models combining two subconstructs. The model ﬁt
statistics worsened in each case. For each combination
of situational normality subconstructs, the original
RMSEA (0.065) increased to 0.075–0.130. Combining a
situational normality variable with structural assurance worsened the RMSEA to 0.14 or 0.15. Combining

all situational normality items into one variable and
the four structural assurance items into one variable
worsened the RMSEA to 0.18. Combining all the variables together produced an RMSEA of 0.19. Combining the situational normality-general and -integrity
subconstructs worsened the ﬁt the least (0.075), followed by combining benevolence and competence
(0.083). In each case, a v2 difference test conﬁrmed that
the original model was a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt. Thus,
the model demonstrates discriminant validity. However, given the marginal declines in model ﬁt when
general and integrity are combined, or when benevolence and competence are combined, these alternatives
may be worth considering in the interest of parsimony.
Trusting Beliefs. Figure 5 shows the CFA results
for trusting beliefs. Convergent validity was demonstrated: path t values (25.9–32.7) were signiﬁcant, the
item lambda coefﬁcients were between 0.81–0.93, and
each path loading was greater than twice its standard
error (0.035–0.050). Although the GFI, NFI, and CFI
statistics were above 0.9, and AGFI was above 0.8, the
RMSEA was 0.101, indicating the model ﬁt was not as
good.

348

Discriminant validity among the subconstructs
could not be assessed simply by looking at the subconstruct intercorrelations, because each was greater
than 0.60. The constrained analyses showed that, for
all pairs, the v2 difference was signiﬁcant (p ⬍ 0.01).
Thus, the model shows discriminant validity. Next, we
ran three models that each combined two subconstructs. The model ﬁt statistics worsened in each case,
with the RMSEA increasing to 0.13 for the benevolence/integrity combination, 0.18 for benevolence/
competence, and 0.21 for competence/integrity. The
model RMSEA was 0.22 when all three subconstructs
were combined. v2 difference tests conﬁrmed the superior ﬁt of the original model. Although the original
model ﬁt is not optimal, combining elements of the
model did not improve ﬁt.
One possible explanation for the less-than-good ﬁt
may be that, with limited exposure to the vendor’s
Web site, subjects may not have had the time to develop trusting beliefs in the vendor at the posited level
of granularity. It is possible that more time and experience are needed for trusting beliefs to evolve along
the discriminant lines (competence, benevolence, and

integrity) proposed in the model. This issue calls for
further investigation.
Trusting Intentions. Figure 6 shows the results for
trusting intentions. Items for willingness to depend
had high lambdas, as did most of those for the Follow
Advice latent variable. Overall, 13 of 16 items had
lambdas above 0.70. The model had a reasonable ﬁt
(GFI/NFI/CFI above 0.9; AGFI above 0.8; RMSEA ⳱
0.073). As before, the lambdas were signiﬁcant and
higher than double their standard errors, indicating
convergent validity.
Although only one subconstruct intercorrelation
was greater than 0.60, all models with constrained correlations of 1.0 between pairs of subconstructs were
run—the v2 difference was signiﬁcant (p ⬍ 0.01) in each
case. We also ran all combinations of models combining two subconstructs. The model-ﬁt statistics worsened in each case. The RMSEA increased to 0.12 for the
willing to depend/follow advice combination, which
the correlations indicated as the most hopeful one. The
model RMSEA was 0.17 when all four subconstructs
were combined. v2 difference tests conﬁrmed the superior ﬁt of the original model, demonstrating discriminant validity.
Hold-out Sample Analysis. As noted previously,
Information Systems Research
Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2002

we had set aside a hold-out sample to reconﬁrm the
results. We ran the models using this hold-out sample.
In general, the hold-out sample had comparable statistics with the original sample, but with slightly worse
ﬁt. For example, the RMSEA increased from 0.043 to
0.058 for disposition to trust, 0.065 to 0.069 for
institution-based trust, 0.101 to 0.114 for trusting beliefs, and 0.073 to 0.076 for trusting intentions. None
of these, in our judgment, indicate that the instrument
has psychometric problems.
Second-Order Model and Internal Nomological
Validity
Figure 7 shows the results for the second-order model,
testing internal nomological validity5 by examining relationships among the trust constructs. The model had
a close ﬁt by the criteria indicated previously (GFI/
NFI/CFI above 0.9; AGFI above 0.8; RMSEA⳱0.049).
The ﬁt with the hold-out sample was slightly inferior,
but still good. The lambdas for most subconstructs
were above 0.7. One exception was trusting stance,
5

We divided tests on nomological validity into internal and external,
based on whether the relationships tested were within the network
of trust constructs, or between the trust constructs and other variables. As far as we know, this is not an established practice, but made
sense in this context.

which indicates that this subconstruct may be somewhat different from faith in humanity. In the trusting
intentions conceptual category, GI and Make Purchases (MP) had low loadings, indicating that these
subconstructs may differ slightly from willingness to
depend or to follow advice. Because the MP loadings

350

were only 0.41, we ran an alternate model without MP
and found it was signiﬁcantly better (based on the v2
difference test)—the ﬁt statistics were, however, similar to the original model (CFI⳱0.93, GFI⳱0.98,
AGFI⳱0.98, NFI⳱0.92, RMSEA⳱0.044).
One possible explanation for the low loadings may

<-----Page 17----->McKNIGHT, CHOUDHURY, AND KACMAR

be that our hypothetical Web site was a free advicegiving site. To respond to questions about making purchases or sharing personal information, the subjects
had to project their likely behavior in a unique scenario. Would they be willing to pay for advice from
the site in case of a future legal dilemma? Would they
be willing to share personal information if it earned
them a 15-minute telephone consultation with one of
the lawyers behind the site? Responding to these scenarios may have required too great an inferential leap
for subjects. Thus, the validity of these items needs to
be tested in the context of a different site whose primary purpose is to sell something and that requires
the user to disclose personal information, such as name
or credit card number.
Data strongly support the proposed links from disposition to trust to institution-based trust and trusting
beliefs, and from trusting beliefs to trusting intention
(all p ⬍ 0.01). However, the link from institution-based
trust to trusting beliefs was not signiﬁcant in the primary sample (although it was in the hold-out sample).
This was surprising. Because the respondents had substantial experience (3.6 years, on average) with the Internet (the institutional context), we would have expected that the link from institution-based trust to
trusting beliefs would be signiﬁcant, and that
institution-based trust would mediate much of the impact of disposition on trusting beliefs. Yet this was not
the case.
One possible explanation may be that most respondents’ experience with the Internet was acquired
through the use of simple information-based and shopping sites, not advice-giving sites like the one used in
this study. Thus, the respondents may have perceived
that the institutional context with which they had experience was not the same as the institutional context
in this study. As a result, dispositional factors inﬂuenced trusting beliefs more than institution-based trust
did. Institutional factors were not, however, irrelevant.
One indication of this was the signiﬁcant result in the
hold-out sample. To explore the issue in greater detail,
we ran the model without disposition to trust—the
links from institution-based trust to both trusting beliefs and trusting intentions were signiﬁcant. These
ﬁndings suggest that, in e-commerce, institution-based
trust may be important, but the relevant institutional
Information Systems Research
Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2002

context may need to be deﬁned in more speciﬁc terms
than just general beliefs about the Internet, particularly
as the Internet begins to be utilized for more specialized applications (such as advice sites). This deserves
further research.
External Nomological Validity
Based on the previously discussed theoretical development of relationships between the trust constructs
and other e-commerce variables, external nomological
validity was assessed as follows. Personal innovativeness was added to the disposition to trust model. General Web experience was added to the institutionbased trust model. Perceived site quality was added to
the combined trusting beliefs and trusting intentions
model. Table 4 shows the results—the numbers reported in the bottom half of the table are the path coefﬁcients between the external and trust constructs.
All the expected relationships were found. Personal
innovativeness was signiﬁcantly (p ⬍ 0.001) related to
disposition to trust. Web experience related to
institution-based trust, and site quality related
strongly to both trusting beliefs and trusting intention
(all p ⬍ 0.001). Thus, the constructs displayed adequate
external nomological validity.

Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce

We found, however, that loadings for the ﬁrst two
items that measured Web experience were low. We ran
an alternate model that split Web experience into two
constructs—items 1 and 2 (reading newspapers and
reading/posting to news groups) as one construct, and
items 3 and 4 (accessing information about products/
services and shopping) as a second construct. The
model ﬁt improved signiﬁcantly, per a v2 difference
test. However, the reliability for the construct with
items 1 and 2 was only 0.56. We then ran a model without the ﬁrst two items for Web experience. The model
ﬁt improved again, and per a v2 test, was signiﬁcantly
better than the ﬁt with all four items. Thus, we recommend that future researchers drop these two items
from the scale for Web experience—it is possible that
even users with high levels of Web usage and experience do not spend much time reading newspapers or
participating in newsgroups.6 However, this results in
a two-item scale for Web experience, which should be
augmented.

Discussion and Conclusions
This paper began with the premise that trust is critical
to consumer adoption of e-commerce. Yet, current
studies on trust in e-commerce may not account for the
complex, multidimensional nature of trust. This study
proposed and empirically validated measures for a
multidimensional deﬁnition of trust with four highlevel interrelated trust constructs, comprised of 16
cross-disciplinary, literature-grounded subconstructs.
Having a comprehensive, consistent set of measures
with sound psychometric properties should enable ecommerce trust research to progress more quickly by
allowing results to be compared across studies.
The study shows that, far from being unitary, trust
has many dimensions. It contributes by validating empirically the distinction among the three dimensions of
competence, benevolence, and integrity, showing that
e-commerce consumers gauge Web vendors not in
broad, sweeping terms, but in terms of speciﬁc attributes. Trusting beliefs demonstrated statistical separation even in the initial relationship, when respondents
had only one interaction with the Web site. Thus, it is
6

352

possible for a consumer to believe quickly that a Webbased vendor is honest and benevolent, but not competent enough to earn the consumer’s business or viceversa. These distinctions should become more
pronounced as the relationship matures, because trusting beliefs differentiate with familiarity. The fact that
the three “faith in humanity” subconstructs were more
discriminant than the three trusting beliefs supports
this. Subjects developed faith in general others’ benevolence, competence, and integrity over a lifetime, making these more discriminant than trusting beliefs in a
speciﬁc vendor, developed in one brief interaction
with the vendor’s Web site. In addition, the paper
shows that these three attributes apply not only to the
interpersonal domain, but also to the dispositional and
institutional domains. That is, even when it comes to
Internet vendors in general, people hold speciﬁc beliefs
with respect to particular attributes rather than
broadly trusting or not trusting.
Furthermore, more than previous empirical trust
studies, this work shows that trust constructs relate to
each other in organized, meaningful ways. This is important because the word trust is commonly used to
describe both detailed phenomena (e.g., “I trust him to
keep his promise.”) and higher order phenomena (e.g.,
“I just don’t trust the Web.”). With the measures presented in this study, trust research can be conducted
at either level of analysis.
The ﬁndings also empirically deﬁne the role of trust
among three constructs already important in ecommerce. Disposition to trust is positively related to
personal innovativeness, Web experience relates positively to institution-based trust in the Web, and perceived site quality is highly correlated with trusting
beliefs and intentions in the vendor. The site quality
ﬁndings show that, in the context of initial relationships, people make judgments about little-known
trustees on the basis of whatever they know. Thus,
users formed beliefs about the attributes of an unknown vendor partly on the basis of perceptions about
Web site quality. People in an uncertain situation seek
assurance for their beliefs through experiential evidence (Fazio and Zanna 1981) such as that supplied by
viewing a Web site.
The study suggests a number of opportunities for further research. Some of these relate directly to overcoming the limitations of this study. First, the current study
Information Systems Research
Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2002

<-----Page 19----->McKNIGHT, CHOUDHURY, AND KACMAR
Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce

did not directly measure behaviors. It would clearly be
desirable to conduct a study in which the ultimate outcome of interest—trust-related behavior (Lewis and
Weigert 1985)—is directly measured. We identiﬁed a
handful of commonly discussed trust-related behaviors in e-commerce—there may be others. Particularly
interesting would be a longitudinal study that tracks
how trusting beliefs are formed, how they lead to trusting intentions, and how these, in turn, lead to actual
behavior.
The loadings for two trusting intentions subconstructs—make a purchase or disclose personal information—were low, perhaps because these functions
did not directly relate to the advice-giving Web site
presented to the subjects. It would be interesting to test
these measures in the context of other Web-based
tasks, such as shopping (Bhattacherjee 2002), where
sharing information and making purchases are more
directly supported.
The speciﬁc focus on advice giving may also explain
why we did not see a signiﬁcant, direct relationship
between trusting beliefs/intentions and institutionbased trust, as deﬁned and measured in this study in
terms of beliefs about Web vendors in general. Two
possible avenues for future research present themselves. Because vendor type matters (Noteberg et al.
1999), the ﬁrst would be to test the link from
institution-based trust to trusting beliefs in a Web vendor selling books, CDs, or airline tickets (Gefen and
Straub 2002), because these vendors may be closer to
what subjects had in mind when answering questions
about institution-based trust. A second approach
would be to adapt the measures of institution-based
trust to be more speciﬁc to the context of a particular
trustee and then examine the same relationship. For
instance, instead of measuring this construct in terms
of perceived attributes of Web-based vendors in general, the items could be changed to measure or manipulate structural perceptions of advice-giving sites on
the Web (Palmer et al. 2000). The latter may become
particularly useful as consumers begin to use the Web
for increasingly specialized tasks.
The model for trusting beliefs, although indicative
of multiple underlying subconstructs, did not have a
very good ﬁt and may require adjustments. The Web
experience scale could also be modiﬁed. Finally, the
Information Systems Research
Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2002

measures developed here could beneﬁt from testing
with different subjects (Cook and Campbell 1979), speciﬁcally nonstudent subjects with more (and less) experience with the Web. In addition, while the scenario
presented (landlord/tenant) was familiar to our subjects, the act of seeking legal advice likely was not.
Thus, it would be interesting to explore how familiarity (Gefen 2000) with the task inﬂuences user trust in
the vendor.
Further research could expand on the ﬁnding that
trusting beliefs are signiﬁcantly affected by disposition
to trust. Speciﬁcally, do people with low versus high
disposition to trust respond differently to trustbuilding treatments, such as icons from third parties
(Palmer et al. 2000)? Can those with low disposition to
trust be persuaded to transact with unfamiliar vendors
without, for instance, referrals from trusted friends or
relatives?
Opportunities exist to extend the results of this study.
For instance, whereas Figure 7 depicts relationships
among the second order trust constructs, researchers
could proﬁtably examine relationships among speciﬁc
subconstructs of these constructs (e.g., structural assurance as related to willingness to provide personal
information). It would also be interesting to examine
how the model presented here might change as we
move beyond the domain of initial trust to trust in ongoing relationships. Clearly, experience would need to
be added to the model (Blau 1964, Cheskin 1999). Beyond that, we believe the constructs included in the
model would still be relevant, but the relationships
among them, and their relative inﬂuence, may change.
We speculated earlier that both dispositional and institutional factors would become less important
inﬂuences on trusting beliefs than the truster’s prior
experience with the same trustee (Gefen 2000). Furthermore, the model for trusting beliefs may become
more discriminant (Lewicki et al. 1998). Additional
trusting beliefs (e.g., predictability—McKnight et al.
1998) may also need to be considered. Will certain
trusting beliefs become more signiﬁcant inﬂuences
than others on trusting intentions? How will buyers
react if a vendor demonstrates competence, but is not
perceived as honest or vice-versa? In addition, the
model should be applied in the B2B environment.
There are opportunities to apply the trust constructs

353

<-----Page 20----->McKNIGHT, CHOUDHURY, AND KACMAR
Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce

and measures to studies of trust-building strategies.
The multidimensional nature of trust suggests that researchers need to study the relationship between different trust-building mechanisms and the speciﬁc trust
constructs inﬂuenced by these mechanisms. Finally,
for research on Internet adoption, it may be interesting
to understand the relative importance of trust vis-à-vis
previously studied adoption constructs, such as relative advantage, perceived usefulness, and perceived
ease of use (Gefen and Straub 2002).
The study also has implications for practitioners. The
most important is again the recognition that trust has
many dimensions (Rousseau et al. 1998). A clear implication of multidimensionality is that a differentiated
trust-building strategy may be necessary, depending,
in part, on the nature of the target audience. For instance, if the target community is less experienced with
the Internet, seals touting the security of the Internet
and clear explanations of structural and technological
safeguards may be used to promote institutional trust.
In an industry where the audience is likely to be more
technology savvy (e.g., in the digital imaging industry)
and Web-based interaction is common, a vendor
should probably focus more on building beliefs about
its own competence through such mechanisms as endorsements from respected customers, seals of approval from professional associations, or a very highquality Web site (Shneiderman 2000). Of course, in
many cases, multiple (or all) dimensions may need to
be addressed in a multipronged, trust-building strategy. For instance, in an industry that consumers may
perceive as being high risk, (e.g., online banking), vendors need to promote both trust in the Internet environment and beliefs about the honesty and/or benevolence of the vendor (Keen et al. 1999) e.g., through

seals from agencies such as Trust-e that attest to the
privacy policies adhered to by the Web vendor.
Practitioners also need to recognize the relationship
among dimensions of trust and their differential effect
on consumer behavior. For example, in the data, the
subjective probability of giving personal information
and of making purchases were more strongly correlated with situational normality-benevolence than
with competence or integrity. This suggests that perhaps vendors need to join forces, in trade associations
or industry groups, to enhance consumer perceptions
of the benevolence of Web-based vendors. Similarly,
beliefs about vendor integrity correlate more with consumer intentions to purchase than beliefs about vendor
competence. Thus, interventions that promote integrity beliefs may have the greatest promise in getting
customers to the purchase stage. Finally, the high correlation between site quality and trusting beliefs underscores the importance of a high-quality Web site.
Rational or not, we found that a high-quality Web site
creates consumer beliefs that the vendor is not only
competent, but also honest and benevolent.
Overall, then, this article contributes by validating a
diverse set of consistent, literature-based trust measures and by showing how these measures relate to
each other and to other e-commerce constructs. We believe the model and the measures hold signiﬁcant
promise to help practitioners and researchers better
understand the dimensions, antecedents, and consequences of trust in the e-commerce domain.
