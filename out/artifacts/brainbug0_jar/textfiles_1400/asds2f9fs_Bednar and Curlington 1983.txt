REVIEW

A growing number of theorists and researchers wvho study human comn-municalion have utilized1a "systems'' perspective
as their fundineamntal theoretical base. Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson's "pragmatic"
approach to human conm-municationprovicled one of the firstmajor discussions of
such a theoretical rationale.5 Weick's notion
of "collective structure" and Scheflen's
"'behavioral programs" also proffered a
similar systems view of communication.6
Fisher and Hawes further expanded the
view of commnunication as a social system
identifiable through interactive behaviors,
and they applied the perspective more precisely to communication research.7
The general principles of this theoretical
perspective have been explicated in other
publications8 and have provided the basis
for empirical investigation of the communication process in numerous settings.9
This approach to the study of communication is summarized by Fisher as follows:
commnunication occurs in a social system;
the structure and function of a system are
visible in the behaviors carried out by indiv iduals; the structureof a comnimunication
system is defined by basic interaction sequences that recur predictably according

Hawes define as "one unit emitted by one

is termed an interact. This unit of analysis
is defined as a contiguous pair of acts or
complete statements- the antecedent act

which provides a translation or reduction
of the complexities of discourse into a simpler set of types.'" Usually, a scheme contains mutually exclusive categories, and
each communication act can be classified
into one and only one category. Each act is
coded in turn, preserving the sequence of
the interaction.
After coding the interaction, the researcher then conducts both a static and
contiguity analysis of the data. Static analysis determines the frequencies of different
acts during any given time period. Contiguity analysis tallies the frequencies of
interacts-antecedent
and subsequent
acts-during the same time period. A time
period, then, may be characterized by recurring patterns of both acts and interacts.'4
The basic research procedure of interaction analysis is to identifyacts and interacts and to determine their arrangements
and recurring patterns over time. These
patterns define the structure, functions,
and behavior of the comnmunication system
at any given timne.'5

can extend these economic analyses. The
Cross model implies, forexample, thatone

their opponent's position. Hamermesh
argues that since this responsivenesswill
probablyoccur just beforetheexpirationof

He assertsthatthispatterncan be observed

of concessionsduring negotiation.Cross's
model implies that if one partydiscovers
the opponent conceding sooner than expected,the responsewill be an increasein
demands, not reciprocal concessions. The
laboratoryexperimentsof Siegel and Fouraker support this inverserelation of concession rates.3' Comay, Melnik, and Subotnik,however,presentempirical evidence
on bargainingduring eight strikesin New
York City that shows that increased concessions by one party are matched with
higher concessions by the other.32They
also find evidence that managementconcedes at a constantrate,whereasunion concession ratesincreaseover time.Associated
with these issues is the possibility,as suggested by Walton and McKersie,that concession behavior is markedly different
during a strike.33
They suggest that when
negotiations fail, there can be an initial
hardeningof positions beforesettlementis
eventuallyreached.
Interaction analysis, by providing descriptivedata on bothimpassedeterminants
and concession behavior,has the potential
of, in Kochan's words, "measuring what
economists tend to defineas unobservable
variables.""

Observingthe Unobservable
A sample analysis of bargaining interaction, employing the systemsperspective
and interactionanalysis, is presented to
show how "unobservable" aspects of economic bargaining theoriescan be studied
empirically.We make no attemptto generalize the results from this one analysis.
Rather, we attempt only to demonstrate
the methodologyand show how its results

about the processof negotiating.
The data forthis example wereobtained
from edited transcriptsof negotiations in
1941 betweentheBarringtonOil Company
and theOil WorkersInternationalUnion.35
The negotiators had addressed approximnately
seventy-five
issues, most of which
had been settled without difficulty.Disagreement still existed, however, on the
wage issue,and thetranscripts
wereofnegotiation sessions that focused primarilyon
thatissue.
The transcriptscover the last seven negotiation sessions between the parties,

extending over a period of five weeks and
resulting in a settlement. Present at the
first three sessions were four local union
negotiators and four company negotiators.
Sessions four through seven saw the same
union and company negotiators, with the
addition of the international union president.
Specifically, this analysis tracks both the
report and command aspects of negotiation messages and employs both static and
contiguity analysis.36 The report or content
aspect of a message refers to what is said,
whereas the command or relational aspect
refersto how the message is said and serves
to define the nature of the relationship between the communicators.37 As Watzlawick,
Beavin, and Jackson argue, "Every communication has a content and a relationship
aspect such that the latter classifies the
formerand is thereforea metacommunication. "38 These authors furtherexplain,

The reportaspect of a messageconveysinformation aind is, therefore, synonymous

communication with the content of the message.

In this example, we trackboth the content
and relational aspects of messages in an
attempt to obtain a more complete understanding of negotiation. Content messages
can be useful in analyzing strategy, and
relational data can be used to examine
how negotiators define and change their
relationship over time.
Transcripts of the negotiations were
divided into "communication units (statements) emitted by one individual, "40 or
"acts," which were the unit of analysis for
the static analysis. Antecedent and subsequent acts, or "interacts," were the unit of
analysis for contiguity analysis. The seven
bargaining sessions produced 265 acts and
264 interacts.
Coding systems with mutually exclusive
and exhaustive categories were required for
purposes of classifying communication
units. As this research example tracks both
relational and content dimensions of bargaining messages, two coding systemswere
employed.

Content coding was accomplished with
a coding system developed by Walcott and
Hopmann.41 Bargaining Process Analysis
II (BPA II) represents the attempt of Walcott and Hopmann to measure the negotiation process in small groups. The coding
system measures the following:
substantive behavior, or behavior directly
associated with the subject matter of negotiations, such as initiations, acceptances,
rejections, and retractions;
strategic behavior, or behavior designed
to affectthe behavior of other actors in the
not implying a subnegotiations-but

Relational coding was accomplished
with the coding systemdeveloped by Ellis.43
(The Ellis coding system is an extension of
the system developed by Rogers and Farace.-4) Statements are coded into either control bids ( T ), which are attempts to domi-

natc or control the interaction; deference
( I ), which symbolizes submissiveness to
another; or equivalence ( - ), which is a bid
for mutual identification.45

relational categories were collapsed into three for
purposes of data analysis. "Dominance" and "Structuring" were collapsed to form the "Control Bids"
category; 'Equivalence" remained the same; and

The data were divided and analyzed in
several ways. First, the seven negotiation
sessions were divided in two by the session
at which the national union representative
intervened. This division of the data permitted comparisons between the interactions at the firstthree sessions (in which
the union spokesman was the local union
president) and the interactions at sessions
four through seven (in which the union
spokesman was the international union
representative).
The data were also divided into three
phases, each approximately equal in terms
of numbers of acts and pages of transcript.
Sessions one and two were combined for
phase one; sessions threeand four forphase
two; and sessions five, six, and seven for
phase three. This division of the data facilitated both static and contiguity analyses to
determine whether unique

phases.
The data were firstanalyzed at the level of
the act. Percentages of statements in each
content and relational category provide a
description of the statements employed
by the negotiators at various stages of the
negotiation.
The data were also analyzed at the level
of the interact,using Markov-chain analysis.
A Markov model is a discrete-statestochastic
model, or a "time series model in which the
characteristic and useful properties appropriate to the time series are not the deterministic mean-value functions but the probability structure itself."46 In other words,
stochastic models are not appropriate to
predict changes in the mean values of a
process over time, but rather they are used
to predict changes in probability distribu"Deference" and "Submissiveness'' were collapsed
to formthe "Deference"category.
Two trained raters coded the data. Tests of reliability were performedon all units of analysis coded
in the relational categories.The interrater

tions as a function of time. In this research
example, the Markov model represents
the process of negotiating by focusing on
the transition probabilities between various
statement categories.47
Results for Acts
Table 1 shows that during bargaining
between local union and management representatives, the distribution of statements
aniong the relational categories was similar
for union and management representatives,
but the distribution of content statements
was markedly different.The management
representatives engaged in more task behavior (71 percent vs. 51 percent), less persuasive behavior (7 percent vs. 21 percent),
and less procedural behavior (8 percent vs.
21 percent).
In contrast, during the sessions in which
the union spokesman was the international
representative, the distribution of content
statements was similar for both parties,
except for statements of strategic behavior
(14 percent for union vs. 3 percent formanagement); but the distribution of relational
statements was quite different.The international representative uttered more dominant and controlling statements (55 percent
vs. 43 percent) and deferred less (4 percent
vs. 15 percent) than the management negotiators.

Table 2 shows the percentage of content
and relational acts for the three phases of
bargaining, each representing about onethird of the number of acts and pages of
transcript. The distribution of relational
statements was similar in most respects,
although in phase one, the management
representatives employed a much higher
percentage of task behaviors (74 percent vs.
51 percent), and the union negotiators engaged in more persuasive behavior (21 percent vs. 2.5 percent) and procedural behavior
(23 percent vs. 8 percent).

economic analystsbecause it presumably involves "unobservable" phenomena.

Results for Interacts

used to determinewhetherthe transition
probabilitieschanged over time.48This test
comparesan individual time-periodmatrix
with a composite matrix. The AndersonGoodman statistichas a Chi-square distribution, and a statisticallysignificant
result signifies change in the interaction
over time.49

strugggle
This researchexample allowed forcomparisons between report and command
aspects of bargaining messages. As mentioned previously,one of the interesting
findingswas thattheprobabilisticstructure
of command (or relational) messages
changed over time, while the structureof
report (or content) statementsremained
stable. The results for report statements,
however,should be interpretedcautiously
because of the limited numberof units of
analysis in this study.
Since there is evidence that transition
probabilities for relational statements
remain stable in uninterruptedbargaining
(when union and managementrepresentatives remain unchanged), it may be that
the predomninantpattern of competitive
symmetrycontinues throughoutbargaining, whereas the contentmessageschange.
In other words, the typesof contentstatenents utilizedin negotiationmayvaryover
time yet continue to maintain a predominant "one-up" ( T ) patternof interaction.
The data in Tables 3 and 4 show how interactionanalysiscan be used toexaminethe
conflicting evidence on concession behavior. As previouslynoted, Comay, Melnik, and Subotnik found that concessions
are reciprocated,yetCross as well as Siegel
and Fouraker argued that increased demands are the predominantresponse.The
argumentthatconcessionsare not reciprocated is supportedby the resultsof this researchexample.
Inspectionof the transitionprobabilities
in Tables 3 and 4 revealedthatthedeferenceto-deferencecell ( It) was empty for all
phases of thebargaininginteraction.In the
"relational" categories, a concession is
coded as deference( t ) and an increased
demand as dominance ( j ).52 If statements

The transitionmatricesof Table 3 show
that deference(antecedent function=

that as bargaining progressed,deference

of bargaining,the probabilitythata dominance statemnlent

of bargaining. Although not conclusive,
these results show how analysis of interkind of
action patternsprovidesa different
data for testing this specific hypothesis
about concession behavior.
An Agenda for Future Research

There are at least two major obstacles
to using interactionanalysis in bargaining
research.The firstis the obvious need for
largersamples. Our researchexample was
a single bargaining case. A much larger
collection of transcripts,or access to live
negotiations,would be necessary to proceed with this line of research.Carefully
executedllaboratorystudies may also providlea means of obtaininginteractiondata.
The second data requirementis theneed

negotiation sessions in our research examnpleproduced a relativelysm-allnumber

analysis of lag structuresusing Markovchain analysisrequiresa much longerseries
of acts and interacts.
If these data requirementscan be satisA negotiatormay,forexample, "defer"byconsenting
to discuss a particular topic suggestedby the other
negotiator without ultimately conceding on that
topic.

It should be noted thattherelationalcoding scheme
used in this researchis not designed specificallyto
measure concession behavior. However, every substantive concession would have been coded in the
deferencerelationalcategory.

fied, future research in the following areas
seems warranted, for several reasons. First,
many economic theories imply that strikes
can result from mistakes in bargaining.
This analysis can be amplified by determining whether the interaction patterns
leading to impasse differfrom those leading to settlement. Second, concession behavior can be studied to see whether, or
under what circumstances, concessions
are reciprocated and how concession rates
change as negotiations progress. A related
question is whether concession patterns
change with the onset of a strike.
Third, it is argued that strikeprohibitions

and other differencesin the legal structure
of private and public sector labor relations
affectthe bargaining process. A comparison
of interaction patterns in bargaining under
these differentlegal structuresis one way of
investigating this issue. Finally, the increasing prominence of public sector bargaining has sparked interest in the impact
of differentthird-party intervention structures. In particular, many hypothesize that
conventional and final-offer arbitration
produce differentbargaining behaviors. A
detailed description of communication
patterns may produce new evidence on that
important question.
