ABSTRACT
In each of two experiments respondents were asked to narrow a given set of
multiattribute options to a ®nal choice in three successive stages. Some participants
were asked to record which options they would include at each stage while others
were asked to record which options they would exclude at each stage. The choice
options in Experiment 1 were 24 alternative automobile descriptions, while in
Experiment 2 participants were presented with 32 dierent graduate schools.
Consistent with the existence of separate criteria for inclusion and exclusion,
signi®cantly more options were retained prior to ®nal choice (in Stages 1 and 2)
under exclusion than under inclusion. This ®nding held both for options with and
without missing information. Nevertheless, when we examined Stage 3 in each
experiment, we found no systematic dierences between the distribution of ®nal
choices in each condition. These results, along with supplemental data, support a
theoretical account in which options about which the decision maker is unsure are
retained under exclusion but not under inclusion. # 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

KEY WORDS:

inclusion and exclusion processes; consideration sets; missing
information

Suppose that you were faced with the task of choosing from a large number of options each varying on
several important dimensions. One strategy would be to break down the task into a series of discrete
steps paring down the number of options as you go. You might then adopt one of two dierent
approaches to this task: including all options at each stage that you would consider at later stages or
excluding all options at each stage that you would reject for consideration at later stages. The obvious
research questions are: Are these two approaches Ð inclusion and exclusion Ð merely two dierent
labels applied to the same process or do they represent truly dierent processes? Will the ®nal choice
you make dier depending on your approach to the task?
Prior research suggests that dierent processes may be involved. Huber et al. (1987) found that a
greater number of job applicants were selected for interviews when subjects were asked to identify

applicants they would not interview than when asked to identify applicants they would interview.
Huber et al. concluded that dierent selection strategies may be used under dierent conditions.
A second and more recent study in this area (Yaniv and Schul, 1997) provides even more evidence to
support the notion of dierent processes for inclusion and exclusion. Subjects were given factual
questions (e.g. `Which of the following elements was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie?') with a list
of 20 possible answers. Subjects in the inclusion condition were instructed to mark alternatives `that
were likely to be the correct answer'. Subjects in the exclusion (or elimination) condition were
instructed either to mark alternatives `that are not likely to be the correct answer' or to mark
alternatives such that `it is likely that they are not the correct answer'. Responses to the two dierent
versions of the exclusion condition did not dier from each other; about 50% were eliminated and 50%
were left within the `answer set'. By contrast, only 18% of the answers were left within the answer set in
the inclusion condition. Yaniv and Schul concluded that the answer set was larger under an exclusion
than under an inclusion condition because each procedure was associated with a separate screening
criterion, with the criterion being more lax under exclusion.
Neither of these studies directly addresses the question of whether varying inclusion/exclusion
instructions in a choice task aects decision processes. Huber et al. come closest, but even they neglect to
address the seemingly related question of whether these same instructions aect ®nal choice. The
present research extends earlier work by presenting subjects with a large number of multiattribute
choice options and asking them to include or exclude options at dierent stages enroute to a ®nal
decision. And, rather than focusing on a decision task with a single correct answer, as in Yaniv and
Schul (1997), the present study focuses on the more common decision task in which decision makers are
asked to choose between options of varying levels of attraction with no external criteria for correctness.
Researchers in the area of decision making have long recognized that obtaining data prior to ®nal
choice can reveal much about the process by which a decision is reached. `Think-aloud' procedures
which require decision makers to verbalize their thought processes have yielded verbal protocols which
have shed light on the strategies used to arrive at a decision (Ericsson and Simon, 1993). Similarly,
information-monitoring techniques have yielded patterns of information search which have been used
to dierentiate between compensatory and non-compensatory strategies (Payne et al., 1993). Finally,
explicitly requiring decision makers to prescreen choice options one at a time has provided data for
comparing pre-decision and decision rules (Beach, 1993).
A new technique called phased narrowing appears to be particularly well suited for addressing the
similarities and dierences between choosing and rejecting. One of the strengths of phased narrowing is
its ability to track changes in set size and set formation, speci®cally in terms of the relative impact of
dierent attributes across successive decision stages (Levin and Jasper, 1995; Levin et al., 1996). With
this technique, subjects are asked to form a `consideration set' in Stage 1, to form a `choice set' in
Stage 2 and then, to make a ®nal choice in Stage 3. (See Nedungadi, 1990, and Shocker et al., 1991, for
formal de®nitions of consideration and choice sets.) In the present study we will use the phased
narrowing technique to compare inclusion and exclusion approaches from start to ®nish. Among the
research questions to be addressed are:
(1) Does the number of choice options selected for `consideration set' and `choice set' formation
depend on whether instructions stress inclusion or exclusion of options?
(2) If indeed it does, where or at what stage(s) of the decision process do these dierences occur?
(3) Are there other information-processing dierences between inclusion and exclusion?
(4) Do inclusion and exclusion instructions yield the same or dierent ®nal choices?
Experiment 1 addresses these four questions; Experiment 2 provides data for addressing a ®fth
question: Are choice options containing missing information treated dierently under inclusion and
exclusion conditions?

Choosing Versus Rejecting Options

195

EXPERIMENT 1
According to Yaniv and Schul's (1997) screening model with two criteria, inclusion and exclusion are
not complementary processes. In their model, Celim 5 Cinc where Celim and Cinc are, respectively,
the criteria for elimination (exclusion) and inclusion. Speci®cally, non-complementary judgments are
expected for a set of alternatives because the strength of support, S, for some alternatives may lie in the
region between the two criteria, i.e. Celim 5 S 5 Cinc. With an inclusion process, a decision maker
includes an alternative only if S 4 Cinc. With an exclusion process, a decision maker eliminates an
alternative only if S 5 Celim. In other words, under inclusion support is required before an alternative
exceeds criterion, but under exclusion lack of support may not be sucient for rejection. That is, under
exclusion, alternatives may be retained unless there is particularly strong evidence against them. Thus,
some of the same alternatives that are eliminated under inclusion may be retained under exclusion.
The main principles of this model can be extrapolated to apply to the case of multiattributemultioption choices varying in degree of preference for individual decision makers. Choice options
which the decision maker has neither strong feelings for nor against are likely to lie between the
thresholds for inclusion and exclusion. Options which represent a mixture of favorable and unfavorable levels of key attributes might ®t this category. The presence of such options should lead to more
items being retained in the consideration set under exclusion than under inclusion. However, because
such options are not likely to be among a decision maker's top choices, we have no reason to predict
dierences between ®nal choices under inclusion and exclusion.
The phased narrowing method should allow us to detect dierences between inclusion and exclusion
conditions and determine at what stages they occur. Furthermore, and this is the key, the phased
narrowing method should allow us to determine if decision makers focus on dierent attributes when
choosing versus rejecting options and whether this, in turn, aects their ®nal choice.

Method
Participants
Eighty-three undergraduate psychology students at a large midwestern university participated in the
experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: an inclusion
group (n  28) who were asked to select options to include at each stage, an exclusion group (n  29)
who were asked to exclude options at each stage, and a control group (n  26) who were asked merely
to make a ®nal choice.
Stimuli
Each of 24 automobile options was described by its price, a reliability rating, a safety rating, and the
percentage of American workers employed in the manufacture of that particular automobile (see Levin
et al., 1996, for a description of the role of this attribute). Combinations were selected so that no one
option dominated any other option on all four attributes and the interattribute correlations were zero.
See Exhibit 1 for a complete description of the design.
Procedure
Participants in each condition were given an experimental booklet which included a cover story
describing that the study's purpose was to see how consumers make dicult decisions such as

the options, identi®ed by the letters A through X, appeared.
Following the cover story, participants in the control condition were told to examine each of the
24 options carefully and to choose the one that they thought they would actually buy. Participants
in the inclusion and exclusion conditions were given more detailed instructions concerning each
successive stage. The instructions were identical for these two conditions except for the phrases dealing
with inclusion/exclusion. The instructions for the inclusion (exclusion) condition were as follows for
Stages 1, 2 and 3, respectively:
After examining each of the 24 brands carefully, choose those brands that you would (would not)
be interested in looking at if window shopping for a car. The brands that you select should be
brands that you would (would not) want to examine ®rst-hand at a dealership. Record the letters
of the brands that you selected (eliminated).
Now, look over the cards that remain after part I. Select from this set those brands that you would
(would not) seriously consider buying. Record the letters of the brands that you selected
(eliminated).
Now, look over the cards that remain after Part II. Select the one (Eliminate all except the one)
you think you would actually buy.
The above instructions roughly parallel those used by previous researchers to generate the transition
from `awareness set' to `consideration set' to `choice set' to `®nal choice' (Nedungadi, 1990). Participants were given instructions for one stage at a time; they did not know ahead of time that it was to be a
three-stage task. Following the choice task, participants in each condition completed a questionnaire
(initially developed by Jasper and Levin, 1997, to test the validity of the phased narrowing technique)
in which they rated how satis®ed and con®dent they were with their ®nal decision, how dicult,
involving, interesting, and `natural' the task itself seemed, and whether or not they thought the
procedure helped them make a better decision (phased conditions only). In addition, participants were
asked to rate (on a scale of 1 to 10) the importance they placed on each attribute and to estimate the
time that it took to complete the task.
Results
There are two main sources of data in this study: the number of options selected at each stage and the
attribute values of these options. The primary analyses will use these data to focus on the similarities
and dierences between inclusion and exclusion. The remaining results compare these conditions with
each other and with the control condition in terms of subjects' perceptions of the task and the ability of
each condition to `capture' the subject's decision-making policy. Again, of particular interest and
importance in this section are comparisons of attribute impact (or weights) in Stage 3, or ®nal choice.

Exhibit 2. Mean number of options retained at each stage for inclusion and exclusion conditions in Experiment 1

Number of surviving options at each stage
Exhibit 2 gives the mean number of surviving options following inclusion or exclusion in Stages 1 and 2.
It can be seen that more options remain in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition in both
Stage 1 and Stage 2. Analysis of variance con®rmed that this dierence was signi®cant, F(1,55)  5.15,
p 5 0.05, while the interaction between conditions and stages did not approach signi®cance (F 5 1).
Thus, while the reduction in options as a result of Stage 1 (the `consideration set' formation stage) was
greater with inclusion instructions than with exclusion instructions, the further drop from Stage 1 to
Stage 2 (i.e. the `choice set' formation stage) was about the same for each condition.
These data can also be organized in a way that permits a direct comparison with Yaniv and Schul's
(1997) data. These authors, in order to test the complementarity of elimination and inclusion, plotted
the probability of retaining an option in their elimination condition (Y-axis of their Exhibit 4) against
the probability of retaining that option in their inclusion condition (X-axis). Each of the 600 alternatives
used in their study was represented by a dierent point on the graph. The preponderance of points fell
above the diagonal for equal probability, which they took as evidence of non-complementary processes.
Although not shown here, our data, if plotted the same way, show essentially the same pattern.
Attribute weights
Exhibit 3 gives the mean attribute standard scores for Stage 1, 2, and 3 choices of both the inclusion
and exclusion subjects. Brie¯y, these scores or `weights' were derived from the mean level of each

attribute for the option(s) selected at each stage. The logic here is that the more important an attribute
is, the more likely that options will be selected that are favorable on that attribute. In order to compare
attributes within and between conditions, attribute levels were converted to standard scores such that
the more favorable the level, the higher the standard score.1 The most noteworthy feature of Exhibit 3
is the close correspondence between inclusion and exclusion conditions, showing that attention to the
dierent attributes is very similar for the two procedures.
As a test of whether characteristics of the ®nal choice varied across experimental conditions, attribute standard scores for Stage 3 were compared in a 3 (condition) 3 (attribute) analysis of variance.
Using continuous scores as the dependent variable provides a more powerful test than just using
discrete choices. A nonsigni®cant attribute by condition interaction indicated that the attribute levels of
the ®nal choice did not dier signi®cantly across conditions, F(4,160)  1.56, p 4 0.10. Follow-up tests
revealed that attribute weighting dierences between the exclusion and control conditions approached
signi®cance (p  0.09), while dierences between the inclusion and exclusion conditions did not
(F 5 1).2,3
Another comparison between only the inclusion and exclusion conditions with decision stage as a
factor also failed to ®nd key dierences. While the attribute by decision stage interaction was significant, F(4,220)  20.32, p 5 0.001, with attribute standard scores tending to become more polarized
across stages, the attribute by decision stage by condition interaction did not approach signi®cance. In
sum then, these analyses show that the characteristics of ®nal choice did not dier across conditions
nor did the conditions dier in tracking changes in attribute weighting across stages.
Measures of attribute standard score variability, as well as mean standard scores, are potentially
informative in comparing inclusion and exclusion processes. If participants in a particular condition
tend to focus on one or two attributes to the exclusion of others in selecting options at a particular
stage, then standard scores will be highly variable across attributes. If, on the other hand, participants
tend to give equal weight to all attributes when evaluating options, then attribute standard scores will
1 Standard scores are computed as follows: The mean and standard deviation of each attribute are computed from the given
stimulus levels in the original set of 24 options. Because of the symmetry in the initial attribute levels, the mean always
corresponds to the middle level of an attribute. The standard scores in Exhibit 3 are thus in the form of number of standard
deviations above or below the middle level of a given attribute. For analytic purposes, the sign is reversed for price such that
positive values would represent the selection of low priced options. A positive standard score in Exhibit 3, for example,
represents the selection of options that are on average above the middle level and favorable on a given attribute; the opposite is
true of negative scores. The higher the score of an attribute in a given stage, the more impact it had on participants' choices at
that particular stage. Greater impact may re¯ect either greater intrinsic importance of an attribute or a greater subjective range
of attribute levels. This indeterminancy, however, does not confound comparisons of an attribute's impact across experimental
conditions.
2
Three attributes instead of four were used because attribute standard scores are not independent, i.e. they sum to zero. The
fourth is a linear combination of the other three. The three attributes used were reliability, price, and % American workers.
3 While the use of attribute standard scores as a continuous dependent variable provides a more powerful test than the use of
discrete choices, we thought it might also be of value to look at the frequency data for ®nal choice. No formal analyses were
conducted; however, descriptively, these data line up nicely with the results for attribute standard scores. Across all three
conditions, the most popular option was B (left column, second from top in Exhibit 1). This was followed by A (left column, top
entry) and then G (second from left column, top entry) in the inclusion and exclusion conditions, and by G then A in the control
condition.

be less variable. Variability of attribute standard scores was calculated for each subject on Stages 1 and
2 of the inclusion and exclusion conditions and the means of these variability measures were compared.
(Note that such measures could not be compared across conditions on Stage 3 because, as illustrated in
Exhibit 1, each option in the experimental design was composed of the highest level of one attribute,
the second level of another attribute, the third level of another attribute, and the lowest level of the ®nal
attribute. Thus, the measure of variability of attribute standard scores for a single choice option was
the same, regardless of which option was selected.) Variance of attribute standard scores was
marginally higher (p  0.05) in the inclusion condition than in the exclusion condition and was higher
on Stage 2 than on Stage 1. This suggests that subjects increased their focus on a dominant attribute or
attributes over stages and that focus was more prevalent under inclusion than under exclusion. Based
on this ®nding and the lesser number of options retained under inclusion, inclusion appears to
represent a more focused process than exclusion.
As a ®nal way of comparing attribute levels for all three conditions, subjects' self-explicated attribute
weights were related to attribute standard scores obtained from ®nal choices. (Jasper and Levin, 1997,
also did this, but as a way of testing the validity of phased narrowing; here, we use it to compare
inclusion and exclusion.) A separate correlation between self-explicated and choice-based, `derived'
attribute weights was computed for each subject. Mean correlations were 0.77 for the inclusion
condition, 0.83 for the exclusion condition, and 0.85 for the control (®nal choice only) condition.
Statistically, these means were not signi®cantly dierent from each other (F 5 1), showing, as in the
Jasper and Levin study, that the conditions were comparable in terms of capturing subjects' ability to
judge the importance they assigned to the various attributes.
Survey responses
Exhibit 4 gives the mean response for each condition to the attitudinal survey items. There were no
signi®cant dierences between conditions except for the estimated time to complete the task which was
greater for the inclusion and exclusion conditions than for the control conditions; interestingly, there
was no signi®cant dierence in perceived processing time between inclusion and exclusion, although
there was a trend for time to be greater in the exclusion condition (possibly because the subjects in this
condition wrote down more letters). Thus, as in the Jasper and Levin (1997) study, the constraints
imposed by the phased narrowing procedure (under both inclusion and exclusion instructions) do not
appear to alter subjects' con®dence nor their ratings of the `naturalness' of the task. Furthermore,
subjects in the inclusion and exclusion conditions gave relatively high and similar endorsements to the
items concerning the usefulness of the procedure.
Discussion
This experiment adds to the psychological literature in demonstrating the usefulness of processtracing methods which provide data about predecisional processes. It also contributes to the
debate surrounding inclusion and exclusion processes. In particular, the current experiment showed
that a mindset to reject undesirable options leads to dierent predecisional choices than a mindset
to choose desirable options. Both consideration sets and choice sets are larger in the exclusion
condition than in the inclusion condition. This is compatible with the notion that the criterion for
retaining an option in a choice task is higher when that option is considered for inclusion rather than
exclusion.
In its simplest form, the dual-criteria model says that a decision maker has to be relatively certain
before deciding in the armative to choose an option in the inclusion condition or to reject an option
in the exclusion condition. Without explicit instructions to include or exclude, individuals with

dierent mindsets may thus dier in their predecisional behavior. The present experiment shows that
this occurs early on, in the formation of consideration sets. Speci®cally, we argue that in forming
consideration sets under an inclusion instructional set, decision makers tend to discard options about
which they are unsure. Under an exclusion instructional set, decision makers tend to retain these
options. Because `unsure' options are those that are not apt to rise to the top, their disposition did not
aect ®nal choice.
Supplementary data
To further explore the interpretation that `unsure' options account for the dierences observed between
inclusion and exclusion conditions, new data were collected in which 37 new participants from the same
subject pool were asked to sort the same options into categories of `include', `exclude', and `unsure',
before making a ®nal choice. Two versions of the task were constructed, one which comes closer to the
wording of the inclusion condition of Experiment 1 and one which comes closer to the wording of the
exclusion condition.
Speci®cally, participants in Group 1 (n  20) were told to `place [the 24 brands] into the following
three categories: 1) those brands that you would be interested in looking at if window shopping for a
car; that is, those brands that you would want to examine ®rst-hand at a dealership; 2) those brands
that you might or might not be interested in looking at if window shopping for a car; that is, those
brands that you're unsure about including; and 3) those brands that remain; that is, those brands that
you would not be interested in looking at if window shopping for a car.' Participants in Group 2
(n  17) were told to `place [the 24 brands] into the following three categories: 1) those brands that you
would not be interested in looking at if window shopping for a car, that is, those brands that you would
not want to examine ®rst-hand at a dealership; 2) those brands that you might or might not be
interested in looking at if window shopping for a car; that is, those brands that you're unsure about

eliminating; and 3) those brands that remain; that is, those brands that you would be interested in
looking at if window shopping for a car.'
The key is to compare the distribution of options here, where `unsure' is added as a category, with the
number of options retained in Stage 1 for the inclusion and exclusion conditions of Experiment 1. If
participants in the exclusion condition of Experiment 1 tended to retain those options about which
they were unsure, then the number of options retained in Stage 1 for these participants should be
approximately the same as the number placed into the `include' plus `unsure' categories by participants
in Group 2. By contrast, if participants in the inclusion condition of Experiment 1 tended to eliminate
those options about which they were unsure, then the number of options retained in Stage 1 for these
participants should be approximately the same as the number placed into only the `include' category by
participants in Group 1.
We thus compared the mean number of options retained in Stage 1 for the inclusion and exclusion
groups of Experiment 1 with the mean number of options placed into the `include' and `include plus
unsure' categories by the comparable groups in the present experiment. The mean number of options
retained in Stage 1 for the inclusion group of Experiment 1 (7.25) came closer to the number in
the `include' category (5.40) than to the sum of the `include' and `unsure' categories (12.45) of the
comparable group in the present experiment. The opposite result held for the exclusion group of
Experiment 1. The relevant means were 8.79 for the exclusion condition of Experiment 1, 4.59 for the
`include' category of Group 2, and 10.35 for the sum of the `include' and `unsure' categories.
An even stronger test of the correspondence between the supplementary data and the data from
Experiment 1 focused on which particular options fell into dierent categories. The following values
were related to each other: the frequency distribution of options falling into the `unsure' category in the
supplementary data set (combined over the two instructional variations) and the dierence in the
distribution of options retained for later consideration between exclusion and inclusion conditions on
Stage 1 of Experiment 1. If the options retained in the exclusion condition but not in the inclusion
condition tended to be the same ones that subjects judge as `unsure' then these two sets of numbers
should be positively correlated. Across the 24 options, a statistically signi®cant correlation of 0.44 was
obtained. While the magnitude of this correlation is moderate, it should be noted that dierent subjects
with dierent preferences were used in each data set.
Further supporting the idea that the disposition of `unsure' options dierentiates responses to
inclusion and exclusion instructions, those options falling into the `unsure' category and representing
the biggest dierences between inclusion and exclusion were the ones involving a mixture of favorable
and unfavorable values on the two most important attributes, reliability and safety. For example,
options that were at one of the top two levels of reliability but at the third level of safety were
categorized as `unsure' by over half the subjects. Options at the fourth (or lowest) level of safety were
eliminated, regardless of the levels of other attributes.
Taken together, these results lend additional support to a model in which decision makers with a
mindset to include will tend to reject from further consideration those options about which they are
unsure, primarily options with a mixture of favorable and unfavorable attributes, while decision
makers with a mindset to exclude will tend to retain such options.
Experiment 2 addresses the generality of the ®ndings from Experiment 1 as well as addressing other
issues by including an additional variable of interest. Speci®cally, Experiment 2 extends and expands
on Experiment 1 in the following ways:
(1) The problem domain is changed from car buying to selecting graduate schools.
(2) The number of choice options is increased from 24 to 32.
(3) Most importantly, the initial choice set includes options with `missing' information, where a
particular attribute value is listed as `unavailable'.

EXPERIMENT 2
Previous research on the role of missing information in multiattribute judgments and decisions has
revealed that options with missing information tend to be devalued compared to options with
complete information (Levin et al., 1991; Yates et al., 1978). There are two possible interpretations:
the uncertainty associated with an incomplete description could lead to lower evaluations, or people
may tend to impute unfavorable values to missing attributes. There is also evidence to suggest that
decision makers use the perceived relationship between two attributes to impute a value to missing
information based on available information, e.g. food that tastes good must be bad for you
(Johnson, 1988; Levin et al., 1984; Singh, 1991; Yamagishi and Hill, 1981). Experiment 2 is designed
to examine these interpretations within the larger context of comparing inclusion and exclusion
processes.
Speci®cally, the present experiment is designed to provide an expanded view of the role of missing
information in decision making by examining the fate of choice options with missing information
across successive decision stages under inclusion and exclusion conditions. Typically, the role of
missing information has been studied in judgment (rating) tasks; only rarely has it been studied in
discrete choice tasks (Cooke, 1996). Two questions will be addressed:
(1) Do choice options with missing information tend to be discarded faster than options with complete
information?
(2) Does the relative attractiveness of options with and without missing information depend
on whether subjects are under an instructional set to choose or to reject options in successive
stages?
We have several speci®c hypotheses. First, the main ®ndings of Experiment 1 should be replicated
with the new stimulus material used in Experiment 2. Speci®cally, a larger number of choice options
should be retained prior to ®nal choice in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition but
characteristics of the ®nal choice should remain the same in each condition. Second, based on the
tendency of decision makers to devalue options with missing information, these options should be
discarded sooner than those without missing information. Furthermore, the `dropout rate' for options
with missing information should be greater in the exclusion condition, where the focus is presumably
on disadvantages, than in the inclusion condition, where the focus is presumably on advantages
(Sha®r, 1993).4
Method
Participants
Eighty-seven students from introductory psychology classes at the same university as students in
Experiment 1 were randomly assigned to the inclusion group (n  31), the exclusion group (n  28),
and the control (®nal choice only) group (n  28). The participants' task was to put themselves in the
place of a college senior who was interested in going to graduate school in their chosen area of interest
and then to decide which school or schools to apply to.

4 Sha®r (1993) presented subjects with pairs of options in which one option had both more positive dimensions and more
negative dimensions than the other, and found that this `enriched' option was both chosen more and rejected more than the
`impoverished' option. He argued that people were more apt to focus on reasons for choosing an option (i.e. the advantages)
when asked to choose and reasons for rejecting an option (i.e. the disadvantages) when asked to reject.

Choosing Versus Rejecting Options

203

Stimuli
Each graduate school option was described by its location (West Coast or East Coast), the size of the city
in which it was located (50,000 or 500,000 population), its reputation (top 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% of
graduate programs in the country), and its selectivity (admitting the top 5%, 15%, 25%, or 35% of its
applicants). Sixteen options were created by orthogonally combining location and size of city and by
combining reputation and selectivity such that these two attributes were perfectly correlated. For
example, there were no options in which reputation was low and selectivity was high (or strict); these
options would have clearly been dominated by the others. The remaining 16 options were created by
substituting `unavailable' for the level of reputation or selectivity paired with the most extreme levels of
the other factor.5
Thus, in total, there were 32 options from which to select with an equal number of options with and
without missing information. The cover story to participants indicated that the national organization
compiling information on reputation and selectivity had not yet received information on all institutions
and that ®gures for some universities were currently being compiled. Thus, there was no reason for
respondents to assume that missing information was necessarily an unfavorable sign. Exhibit 5
formally lists the attribute levels for each option.

Procedure
Except for the change from automobiles to graduate schools and the rationale for having options with
and without missing information, the instructions for the choice task were virtually identical in
Experiments 1 and 2. In addition to an experimental booklet describing the study, each participant was
given an envelope containing 32 shued cards on which the options, this time identi®ed by the
numbers 1 through 32, appeared.
Parallel to the instructions in Experiment 1, participants in the inclusion (exclusion) condition of
Experiment 2 were asked in Stage 1 to write down the numbers of the universities which they would
(would not) be interested in looking at if `window shopping' for a university, i.e. the `ones that you
would (would not) probably send away for catalogs describing their programs' and in Stage 2 to
record the numbers of the universities they would (would not) seriously consider applying to, i.e. the
`ones that you would (would not) want to visit personally'. In Stage 3 they were asked to select the one
(eliminate all except the one) they thought would be their ®rst choice. Participants in the control
5 There were two reasons why these particular selections were made for creating options with missing information. First, we felt
that reputation and selectivity would be the most important attributes (and this was borne out) and previous work shows that
attention to missing information depends on the perceived importance of that information (Levin et al., 1988). Second, by
including these as correlated attributes, participants could use the value of one to impute a value to the other.

condition, again, were merely told to examine each of the 32 options and indicate the one they would
actually select.
The last 21 subjects in each condition were asked to describe at the end of the choice task (in an
open-ended response format) how they dealt with options with missing information. Following the
choice task, all participants completed the same attitudinal questionnaire used in Experiment 1, and
they estimated (on a scale of 1 to 10) the importance they placed on each attribute and the time it took
to complete the task.
Results
Number of surviving options at each stage
Exhibit 6 gives the mean number of options retained at each stage for the inclusion and exclusion
conditions. Note the similarity to the results of Experiment 1 (Exhibit 2). As in Experiment 1, signi®cantly more options were retained in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition,
F(1,57)  23.73, p 5 0.001, while the interaction between condition and decision stage did not approach
signi®cance. This con®rms our ®rst hypothesis. Interestingly, while the absolute number of options
retained was greater for Experiment 2 than for Experiment 1, when adjusted for total number of
available options, the percentages were very similar across experiments. The only notable change is that
the dierence between the exclusion and inclusion conditions appears to be greater in Experiment 2.

Exhibit 7 displays the mean number of options retained, separately for those options with and
without missing information. Supporting our second hypothesis, fewer options with missing information were retained than options without missing information, F(1,57)  71.23, p 5 0.001. Contrary to
our third hypothesis, however, the dierence between options with and without missing information
was very nearly the same for exclusion and inclusion conditions, resulting in a nonsigni®cant option
type by condition interaction in Stages 1 and 2.
In fact, when the data were analyzed using proportion of retained options with missing data as the
dependent variable, there was a nonsigni®cant trend in the opposite direction as hypothesized. The
proportion of retained options with missing information was higher in the exclusion condition (0.39 for
Stage 1 and 0.33 for Stage 2) than in the inclusion condition (0.35 for Stage 1 and 27 for Stage 2). An
analysis of variance using the logit transformation of these proportions found a signi®cant eect of
decision stage, F(1,57)  5.38, p 5 0.05, showing that options with missing information are not only
devalued but they are increasingly devalued over stages in both the inclusion and exclusion conditions.
Further investigation showed that all missing information options were not treated alike. Each type
of missing information option was represented by four dierent universities (i.e. four dierent
combinations of location and city size). Thus, each type of option could be selected between 0 and
4 times in Stage l. A logical possibility with missing information in our case, i.e. with the use of
correlated dimensions, is that a favorable (unfavorable) level of the `nonmissing' factor, reputation or
selectivity, led to imputation of an unfavorable (favorable) level of the missing factor; under such
circumstances, all missing information options would have approximately the same neutral evaluation.

However, this was counterindicated by the results; participants had clear preferences. Exhibit 8 shows
that the highest level of reputation paired with missing selectivity was the most attractive of these types
of options, followed by the most lenient level of selectivity paired with missing reputation. In other
words, when one factor was missing, it was better for the other factor to be at its most favorable level.
(For most but not all subjects, low selectivity was preferred over high selectivity; this makes the
decision even more dicult given the fact that reputation and selectivity are negatively correlated.)
Also consistent with these results is the fact that most subjects' self-reported weights showed reputation
to be more important than selectivity.
Our ®nal analysis involving options with missing information compared the dropout rate for these
options with the dropout rate for options in which the most important attribute, reputation, was at its
least favorable level (40%). Across inclusion and exclusion conditions and across decision stages, the
dropout rates for these two types of options were nearly identical.
Subjects' open-ended responses to the question of how they dealt with options with missing
information appear to shed some light on their use of strategies. About two-thirds of the respondents
said that they immediately threw out options with missing information. A few subjects in this category
also added that they didn't `trust' options with missing information. Another one-quarter said that
they ®rst threw out those options in which their most important factor (usually reputation) was
missing. Finally, one-®fth said that they used the information presented to estimate the value of the
missing information. While dierent subgroups appear to use dierent mechanisms in dealing with
missing information, none of these fractions diered systematically across experimental conditions.
Attribute weights and survey responses
As in Experiment 1, subjects' choices in Experiment 2 were compared across conditions and stages
using attribute standard scores as the dependent variable. Because of space limitations, only the scores
for ®nal choice will be discussed. These scores were submitted to a 3 (condition) 4 (attribute) analysis

of variance. (In contrast to Experiment 1, attribute standard scores did not automatically sum to zero;
therefore, all four attributes were included.) The attribute by condition interaction was not signi®cant,
F(6,215)  1.57, p 4 0.10.
A comparison of survey responses across conditions also yielded results very similar to those for
Experiment 1. The only item showing a signi®cant dierence was perceived time to complete the task.
Subjects in the inclusion and exclusion conditions reported longer times than did subjects in the control
condition. While the inclusion and exclusion conditions did not dier signi®cantly from each other,
there was again a tendency toward longer perceived times in the exclusion condition.
Discussion
Experiment 2 replicated the main results of Experiment 1 within a new stimulus domain, with a
dierent number of options, and with the incorporation of options with missing information. As in
Experiment 1, Experiment 2 revealed that more options were retained prior to ®nal choice in the
exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition and this dierence occurred early rather than late in
the decision process, i.e. during the ®rst, consideration set formation stage, with no further change
from Stage 1 to Stage 2. In addition, there were no detectable dierences between inclusion and
exclusion in ®nal choice nor in terms of subjects' perceptions of the task.
Experiment 2 also extended the results of Experiment 1. By including options with missing
information in a phased narrowing task, we found that such options were, on average, discarded faster
than options without missing information. The discard rate for these options, in fact, was about the
same as for options containing the least favorable level of the most important attribute. Such ®ndings
represent a new demonstration of the tendency to devalue partially described options in a discrete
choice task. This is particularly interesting in the present case because instructions explicitly indicated
that unavailable information was in the process of being compiled as opposed to being purposely
withheld. We also found that dierent subjects dealt dierently with missing information. However,
the uncertainty associated with incompletely described choice options appeared to play a more
important role for most subjects than did the explicit imputation of unfavorable values to missing
information. Notably, pre-choice dierences between inclusion and exclusion conditions apply equally
to options with and without missing information.
CONCLUSIONS
Prior research comparing inclusion and exclusion processes has among other things measured the size
of the answer set for factual questions (Yaniv and Schul, 1997) and the number of applicants considered
for a job (Huber et al., 1987). The present study extended this earlier work to the more general task of
narrowing multiple multiattribute options to a ®nal choice. We argued and subsequently demonstrated
that the phased narrowing method was particularly well suited for extending models of inclusion and
exclusion processes by tracking decisions to choose or reject options across successive stages, including
comparison of set sizes across stages and conditions, comparison of the impact of each attribute across
stages and conditions, and, in the case of Experiment 2, comparing the fate of options with and without
missing information.
Across varying stimulus sets, one principle remained the same. Subjects retained more options prior
to making a ®nal choice when under an instructional set to exclude undesirable options than when
under an instructional set to include desirable options. The phased narrowing task employed in both
experiments proved useful in isolating exactly when this dierence occurred. Speci®cally, dierences
revealed in Stage 1, corresponding to the formation of consideration sets, remained constant in Stage 2

which corresponds to the formation of choice sets. Thus, dierential dispositions to include or exclude
options appear early rather than late in the choice process. Despite the consistency of results across
three quite dierent tasks (the Yaniv and Schul task and the present Experiments 1 and 2), however, it
may not be universally true that more items are retained under exclusion than under inclusion. If
selection carries a high cost, such as deciding between aversive medical treatments or deciding on
military targets, the more `liberal' criterion for exclusion may disappear.
We also found that dierences between the exclusion condition, the inclusion condition, and a
control condition which required only a ®nal choice were minimal on attitudinal measures such as
con®dence in the ®nal choice and naturalness of the task. The most important ®nding, though, was that
attribute levels of the ®nal choice did not dier between inclusion and exclusion conditions. While
conclusions of `no dierence' are always problematic, we argue that there was ample opportunity to
uncover dierences between conditions in the present set of experiments. Across a variety of measures
applied to independent sets of data from dierent experiments, there were no systematic dierences in
the distribution of ®nal choices between inclusion and exclusion conditions.
Experiment 2 added a further element to the study of choosing versus rejecting by including
alternatives with missing information in the original set of options. Supporting prior research claims
(e.g. Johnson, 1988; Levin et al., 1984), it appears that decision makers use a mixed bag of strategies in
dealing with this type of information. Some subjects immediately dismiss options with missing
information, especially if that particular category of information is deemed crucial, while others use the
relationship between categories to impute a value to the missing information, especially during the
early stages of choice. The main ®nding here, however, was that the inclusion-exclusion dierence in
retention of options prior to ®nal choice held for both options with and without missing information.
So, the question remains: How do mindsets to choose or to reject compare with each other? For the
present tasks, both take about the same amount of processing time and are aected similarly by task
variables such as number of options and the presence of missing information. However, they appear to
result in the formation of dierent pre-choice sets based on dierent criteria for inclusion and
exclusion, and, based on our comparison of variances of attribute weights, they appear to dier in their
tendency to focus on key attributes. Thus, while inclusion and exclusion are similar with respect to the
operation of speci®c variables, such as the presence or absence of missing information, and they receive
similar attitudinal ratings, they are not complementary in the formal sense of the term. Yet they tend to
result in the same ®nal choice.
One's natural inclination is to ask `How can this be?' We argued and subsequently demonstrated that
options about which the decision maker is unsure are the ones most in¯uenced by the inclusion/
exclusion manipulation. These items are apt to be retained longer under an instructional set to exclude
than under an instructional set to include, but they are not apt to rise to the top in the ®nal selection
process in either condition. Therefore, while the two conditions result in dierent-sized pre-choice sets,
they are likely to yield the same ®nal choice.
Dierences in inclusion and exclusion may be related to the perceived costs vs. bene®ts of choosing
vs. rejecting. Retaining more options for later consideration under exclusion, for example, carries with
it the potential cost of greater eort in the ®nal choice stage. A recently completed phased narrowing
study by Levin et al. (1997) incorporated information monitoring procedures that included measures of
eort, and, indeed, eort was signi®cantly greater at the ®nal choice stage for subjects in the exclusion
condition than for subjects in the inclusion condition. This greater ®nal eort, however, may produce
dividends.
There are situations, for instance, in which a `middling' option may suddenly take on special
signi®cance and it may be in these situations where a mindset to include or exclude is particularly
critical. In situations such as selecting graduate schools, one's top choices are not always available and
the size of pre-decisional sets may make a dierence. Potter and Beach (1994) state that thresholds and

importance weights change when subjects are forced to rescreen previously rejected options. Thus,
while ®nal choice did not dier between inclusion and exclusion conditions in the present study, the
possibility exists that with unavailable options dierences in pre-decisional set sizes could aect ®nal
choice. Consider the case where one's top three choices become unavailable, such as a student being
rejected by the top graduate schools. If the choice set under inclusion has only three options whereas
the choice set under exclusion is larger, then in the inclusion condition but not in the exclusion
condition the decision maker must reconsider options previously rejected in forming a consideration
set. Comparing inclusion and exclusion conditions in such situations would be an interesting topic for
future research.
Another factor worth investigating in this regard is diculty of choice. In the present experiments no
`dominated' options were included. If there had been a number of options which were clearly inferior to
others, these should be dropped at an early stage regardless of instructional set, thus attenuating the
inclusion/exclusion dierence. At the opposite extreme, if the options were extremely dicult to
discriminate, then again retention rate might be similar for inclusion and exclusion. Diculty of choice
task should be another element of future studies comparing inclusion and exclusion.
