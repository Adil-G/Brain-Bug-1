a b s t r a c t
Leadership role occupancy has recently been shown to have a genetic basis. We extend prior research by
examining the moderating effects of the social environment during adolescence on the genetic inﬂuences
on leadership role occupancy at work. Utilizing a sample of male twins (89 pairs of identical and 54 pairs
of fraternal twins, with a mean age of 36.5 years), we found that genetic inﬂuences are weaker for those
reared in enriched environments (i.e., higher family socioeconomic status, higher perceived parental support, and lower perceived conﬂict with parents). For those twins who had relatively poorer social environments, genetic inﬂuences on leadership role occupancy are signiﬁcantly greater. These results have
important implications for early interventions on leadership development inside and outside
organizations.

In the last several decades, behavioral genetic research has
ﬁrmly established that individual differences in virtually all intellectual and behavioral domains have a genetic component (see Plomin, DeFries, Craig, & McGufﬁn, 2003). This research has been
extended to a number of phenomena in organizational settings,
such as job satisfaction (Arvey, Bouchard, Segal, & Abraham,
1989), work values (Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal, & Dawis,
1992), job mobility (McCall, Cavanaugh, Arvey, & Taubman,
1997), and entrepreneurship (Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin,
& Spector, 2008). Researchers have also examined the genetic contributions to leadership. Several studies have shown that leadership role occupancy—the extent to which individuals had
occupied or are now occupying positions of formal leadership in
organizational settings—has a genetic component (Arvey, Rotundo,
Johnson, Zhang, & McGue, 2006; Arvey, Zhang, Avolio, & Krueger,
2007; Ilies, Gerhardt, & Le, 2004). Using quantitative behavioral
genetics methods to estimate heritability (i.e., h2, the proportion
of the total observed variability of a variable due to genetic differences between people), Arvey et al. (2006) found, based on a sample of male twins, that about 30% of the individual differences in
leadership role occupancy can be attributed to latent genetic factors (i.e., h2 = .30). This estimate was replicated in an independent
sample of female twins (Arvey et al., 2007).
An interesting and controversial question surrounding the
nature of genetic inﬂuences on leadership is whether the genetic

effects establish constraints on the effectiveness of leadership
development/intervention efforts in organizations and in earlier
life. Partitioning the variance in a measure of leadership into its
genetic and environmental components provides little opportunity
to examine the role played by environmental factors along the
growth path of a potential leader. Apart from the main effects of
genetics, the environment and the developmental efforts stemming from the environment could have an active inﬂuence on
the extent to which one capitalizes on his or her genetic endowments for leadership. Directly relevant to this possibility are
gene–environment interactions (G  E)—the notion that environments can modify the inﬂuence of an individual’s genetic background, either strengthening or weakening the effects of genes
on phenotypes (Plomin, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977).
The present study examines such moderating effects of environmental factors on genetic inﬂuences on leadership. Extending the
ﬁndings of Arvey et al. (2006, 2007), we investigate the moderating
role of the social environment in adolescence on the genetic effects
on leadership role occupancy at work. Speciﬁcally, we examine
whether the heritability of leadership at work is moderated by
individuals’ developmental environment in adolescence.
Studying such moderating effects of the environment has
been advocated as a means to advance research in both basic
(e.g., Dick & Rose, 2002; Van den Oord & Rowe, 1998) and applied (Ilies, Arvey, & Bouchard, 2006) psychology. Ilies et al.
(2006) have suggested that the examination of G  E interaction
effects on organizational behavior constructs is a fruitful avenue
for future research, and argued that organizational scholars

<-----Page 1----->Z. Zhang et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 118–128

should engage in such endeavors in order to advance theories on
the developmental processes leading to individual differences in
behavior at work.
We note at the outset that the social environmental variables
examined in the current study may not be ‘‘purely environmental”
or exogenous in the sense that they are independent of any genetic
inﬂuences. Gene–environment correlations—the notion that genes
may affect the tendency of people to select themselves into certain
environments or evoke speciﬁc responses from the people around
them (Scarr & McCartney, 1983)—may also be present. Consequently, environmental measures could be genetically determined
to some extent (e.g., passive, active, evocative G–E correlations;
Rutter, Mofﬁtt, & Caspi, 2006; Scarr & McCartney, 1983). Previous
research has found genetic inﬂuences in variables that are commonly assumed to be environmental, such as organizational climate (Hershberger, Lichtenstein, & Knox, 1994). The existence of
G–E correlations may confound the results when G  E interactions
are examined (Scarr & McCartney, 1983). Following prior research
(e.g., Purcell, 2002), the current study uses appropriate procedures
to partial out the potentially confounding effects of gene–environment correlations. The details of these procedures are reported in
the method section.

Gene–environment interactions on leadership
For adolescents, the family environment is a critical and the
most important component of the social environment in which
they grow up (Bell, 1968; Zastrow & Kirst-Ashman, 1997). Family
environments (e.g., levels of ﬁnancial resources and parental support) are more proximal and inﬂuential than other aspects of adolescents’ social environments (e.g., neighborhood, school, and
peers; Bahr, Marcos, & Maughan, 1995; Brook, Nomura, & Cohen,
1989). Consequently, in the current study we focus on the family
environment in adolescence and examine its impact on the genetic
inﬂuences on leadership at work. It is notable that family environment can be captured in the behavioral genetics model as the
shared and/or non-shared environmental effects. By deﬁnition,
shared environmental effects refer to the extent to which growing
up in the same family makes people similar. Non-shared-environmental factors refer to the unique environment that different siblings experience, despite growing up in the same family. For
example, although parents’ divorce is a ‘‘common” event to siblings, it could have unique and differential inﬂuences across different children (including twins) because of the unique ways in which
each child experiences this event. In other words, parents’ divorce
is a common environmental factor only to the extent it provide
similar/shared experience to different siblings or twins.
The moderating effects of the family environment on genetic
inﬂuences have been examined for a variety of organizational
behavior-related constructs such as substance use (Dick et al.,
2007), verbal abilities (Asbury, Wachs, & Plomin, 2005), intelligence (Harden, Turkheimer, & Loehlin, 2007; Turkheimer, Haley,
Waldron, D’Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003), and emotional stability
(Jang, Dick, Wolf, Livesley, & Paris, 2005). The direction of the environment’s moderating effects was found to differ across the different constructs examined. For example, supportive and afﬂuent
family environments have been shown to strengthen the effects
of genetic factors on intelligence (e.g., Harden et al., 2007; Rowe,
Jacobson, & Van den Oord, 1999; Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron,
D’Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003). Conceptually, it can be argued that
enriched environments may enable the underlying genetic predispositions to exert greater inﬂuence, and thus, those reared in enriched social environments show higher heritability as compared
with those reared in depleted environments (Bronfenbrenner &
Ceci, 1994).

119

In contrast, other researchers have argued for a weakening
effect of enriched environments on the genetic inﬂuences on certain constructs. They contend that higher genetic inﬂuences could
be fostered by adverse environments (e.g., Gottesman, 1991;
Plomin & Rutter, 1998; Rende & Plomin, 1992). Supporting this
argument, afﬂuent family environments have been shown to
weaken the genetic effects on verbal abilities in early childhood
(e.g., Asbury et al., 2005). Conceptually, in the context of leadership, enriched environments could weaken genetic inﬂuences
because, similar to verbal abilities in childhood, skills and personal
characteristics that lead to leadership emergence are largely interpersonal (social) and are thus typically proactively acquired and
developed through life experience (Day, 2000). (In contrast, intelligence, as an intrapersonal capacity endowment, is less likely to be
inﬂuenced by social factors.) Therefore, the inﬂuence of individuals’ genetic predispositions for leadership could be strengthened
by deprived, conﬂict-ridden environments.
That is, because the development of leadership capabilities, as
well as the emergence of leaders, is thought to depend upon overcoming setbacks, adversity, and crises (e.g., Bennis & Thomas,
2002; Bligh, Kohles, & Meindl, 2004; Luthans & Avolio, 2003;
Masten & Reed, 2002; Osborn, Hunt, & Jauch, 2002), it can be
argued that social environments characterized by adversity and
interpersonal conﬂict allow greater inﬂuence of genetic differences
on leadership potential, thus making individual differences in
genetics more important in distinguishing between leaders and
non-leaders. Conversely, the absence of adversity and conﬂict
makes genetic differences associated with the effective handling
of or learning from such situations less relevant, which would
translate into a weaker link between genetic differences and individual differences in leadership emergence. As Bennis (1994) suggested, one of the most reliable predictors of leadership is people’s
capability to ﬁnd meaning in negative situations and to learn from
these circumstances. Bennis (1994, p. 121) argues that people’s
adaptive capacity is ‘‘an almost magical ability to transcend adversity, with all its attendant stresses, and to emerge stronger than
before”. Coutu (2002) also contends that the ability to rebound
from adversity and conﬂict is critical to successful leaders. Therefore, the presence of adverse factors during one’s early development stages could allow and even magnify the inﬂuences of
differences in genetic backgrounds when predicting leadership role
occupancy at work.
Thus far, we have presented two distinct conceptual arguments
suggesting opposite moderating effects of the social environment
on the heritability of leadership. Following theoretical and empirical work on the heritability of intelligence (e.g., Rowe et al., 1999;
Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron, D’Onofrio, & Gottesman, 2003), the
ﬁrst argument suggests that more enriched, as opposed to more
impoverished, environments would allow greater inﬂuence of
genetic differences in leadership capacity, thus strengthening the
heritability of leadership emergence. Second, based on leadership
theory that links overcoming adversity and crises to leadership
emergence (Bligh et al., 2004; Luthans & Avolio, 2003), and given
the social nature of leadership skills which suggests that learning
and development play a crucial role in the realization of one’s leadership potential (unlike for intelligence), an opposite effect can be
predicted such that more impoverished social environments like
those involving interpersonal conﬂict would allow the greater
inﬂuences of genetic differences in leadership capacities.
In sum, previous conceptual work can be interpreted to suggest
both a positive and a negative moderating effect of the social environment on the heritability of leadership role occupancy. Because
of the lack of speciﬁc empirical research on gene–environment
interactions in the context of leadership emergence, we will not
formally propose a directional moderating effect, but rather examine the direction of such interactions in an exploratory fashion. In

the following sections we describe three measures reﬂecting the
social environments that people face in adolescence, and we then
empirically examine the moderating effects of these measures on
the genetic inﬂuences on leadership role occupancy at work.

ship in later life. This view predicts that conﬂict with parents positively inﬂuences the heritability of leadership emergence. Next we
describe a study that tests such opposite predictions for the moderating effects of the three environmental variables on the heritability of leadership role occupancy at work.

Family socioeconomic status
Socioeconomic status (SES) describes a family’s ranking on a
hierarchy according to access to or control over some combination
of valued commodities such as wealth, power, and social status
(Mueller & Parcel, 1981). SES often serves as an overall measure
of the level of resources available to adolescents when they grow
up (McLoyd, 1998). Following the previous arguments, high SES
(and thus high levels of resources and enriched environment)
could either allow greater impacts of genetics in inﬂuencing leadership emergence (as is the case for intelligence) or weaken the
effect of individual differences associated with their genetic backgrounds on leadership potential. The reasoning here is that those
with high SES experienced less adversity compared to those with
low SES, because low SES can be considered an indicator of adverse
social environments during the developmental years.
Perceived parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents
We also examine the moderating role of two direct measures of
family environment when adolescents were growing up: perceived
parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents. High parental support in adolescence, similar to high levels of family SES,
may reﬂect a supportive and enriched environment in which individuals can fully develop their genetic leadership potential because
enriched family environments can promote the development of
skills that allow individuals to more efﬁciently capitalize on future
leadership opportunities in life. This suggests that parental support
would positively inﬂuence the heritability of leadership
emergence.
Conversely, in enriched social environments, abundant
resources may play a greater role than individuals’ genetic endowments in promoting leadership emergence in later life. Moreover,
individuals in depleted parental environments do not have such
luxuries and have to rely upon their genetic endowments to develop their leadership potential; thus, the genetic potential for leadership would be more inﬂuential in such an environment. Following
this line of thinking, the parental support that individuals experienced during adolescence would negatively inﬂuence the genetic
effects on leadership emergence such that the heritability of role
occupancy at work would be lower for those who experienced high
levels of parental support.
As noted, the presence of interpersonal conﬂict is a feature of
the social environment thought to be important for the development of leadership skills. Because we study the role of the social
environment in adolescence, we focus on conﬂict with parents as
a particularly salient form of interpersonal conﬂict during these
formative years. As was the case with the other two environmental
constructs, if harmonious family environments characterized by
little interpersonal conﬂict provide the nutrients for the realization
of genetic differences in leadership capacities, conﬂict should negatively inﬂuence the heritability of leadership emergence, such
that the heritability would be higher for those who experienced
low conﬂict with their parents in adolescence.
On the other hand, as discussed in the introduction, managing
conﬂicts or crises, as well as learning from such experiences, is
important for leadership (e.g. Bligh et al., 2004; Luthans & Avolio,
2003; Mumford, Friedrich, Caughron, & Byrne, 2007; Osborn
et al., 2002), and the presence of interpersonal conﬂict in adolescence may therefore allow greater inﬂuence of genetic differences
in individuals’ conﬂict management abilities that predict leader-

Methods
Sample and procedures
The sample consists of a cohort of identical (i.e., monozygotic or
MZ) and fraternal (i.e., dizygotic or DZ) twins drawn from the Minnesota Twin Registry (see Lykken, Bouchard, McGue, & Tellegen,
1990). The Registry used public birth records to identify various
cohorts of twins born in the state of Minnesota. For the present
investigation, we utilized a series of surveys conducted on a cohort
of male twins born between the years 1961 and 1964 (a cohort of
1116 twins).
The current study uses data from three surveys conducted at
different time points. When the twins were ﬁrst recruited to the
Registry (in 1995, when they were, on average, at the age of 32),
885 of them completed a Background Questionnaire and provided
demographic information and measures on their family background including family socioeconomic status. The response rate
was 79.3% for this survey. In 1997, this cohort received a Parental
Environmental Questionnaire assessing their retrospective perceptions of parental environment when they were adolescents including perceived parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents.
A total of 682 of the twins completed this questionnaire, yielding a
response rate of 34.2% for this survey. In 2000, the same cohort received a survey on their leadership activities, and a total of 650
completed this survey, yielding a response rate of 58.2%. Due to
the response rates to the various surveys, analyses have slightly
different sample sizes when different parental environment variables were examined. In particular, sample size is 286 (89 pairs
MZ twins and 54 pairs DZ twins) when perceived parental support
and perceived conﬂict with parents were examined as potential
moderators of genetic inﬂuences on leadership. Sample size is
340 (103 pairs of MZ and 67 pairs of DZ twins) when SES was
tested as a moderator. Among the 286 twins, all are white males
with a mean age of 36.5 (SD = 1.09), and 74.4% were married or living with a partner. With regard to education levels, 60.9% of them
have high school or higher educational attainment.
Data based on the leadership questionnaire have been published elsewhere (i.e., Arvey et al., 2006) in which the existence
of genetic inﬂuences on leadership role occupancy was investigated. Although the dependent variable in the current study is
the same as that in Arvey et al. (2006), we ask very different
research questions in this study (related to the moderating role
of family environments). Moreover, the various measures assessing
environmental characteristics were drawn from survey instruments not used in prior research reports on leadership using this
database.
Measures
Leadership role occupancy
Participants’ responses to two questions were used to assess
their leadership role occupancy at work. The ﬁrst question asked
them to indicate, on a checklist, whether they had held positions
at work that would be considered managerial or supervisory in
nature (e.g., work group leader, director, vice-president, etc.). The
positions were coded according to the organizational hierarchy
(e.g., we assigned 7 points for ‘‘President”, 6 points for ‘‘Vice-President”, etc.). The second question asked the individuals to indicate

<-----Page 3----->Z. Zhang et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 118–128

the number of work-related professional associations in which
they served as a leader. These two measures used the bio-history
approach, which is a well-known and acceptable procedure in
assessing autobiographical or historical events among individuals
(Mumford & Stokes, 1992). Eleven follow-up phone calls were
made to verify the information participants provided on these
two questions, and no errors were detected. The two scores were
standardized and summed to form a composite measure of leadership role occupancy. The same measure was used in Arvey et al.
(2006), who reported detailed information on the psychometric
properties of this composite measure. These authors also provide
conceptual and empirical support for the validity of this measure
to assess leadership role occupancy.
Socioeconomic status (SES)
SES was measured as a composite score of the father’s occupational status and the mother’s level of attained education, which
are the two most frequently used indexes of SES (Ensminger &
Fothergill, 2003). Education level was assessed as the number of
years completed at school, ranging from 0 to 21. Occupational status was measured using the Hollingshead Index of Social Position
(Hollingshead, 1975), which rates occupations (rather than jobs)
on a 7-point scale where 1 = higher executives, proprietors of large
concerns, and major professionals, and 7 = unskilled employees.
This occupational status measure was reverse coded so that higher
scores represent higher status occupations. The two measures
were standardized and then summed to present SES. The coefﬁcient alpha was .85. Similar indicators of SES were used in previous
research such as Kennedy (1992) and Otto and Atkinson (1997).
Perceived parental support
Perceived parental support was measured using the Parent
Environment Questionnaire (PEQ; Elkins, McGue, & Iacono, 1997).
The PEQ is a 42-item self-report inventory and was developed for
assessing different aspects of parent–child relationships. The
parental support scale in PEQ consists of 12 items for father and
mother separately, assessing the extent to which the parent–child
relationship is characterized by support and closeness. Each item
was answered on a 4-point scale (4 = deﬁnitely false, and 1 = deﬁnitely true). Sample items include ‘‘I talked about my concerns and
my experiences with my parent” and ‘‘My parent comforted me
when I was discouraged or have had a disappointment”. Responses
were scored such that higher scores indicate higher support from
the parent. The internal consistency reliability was .91 for father
and .88 for mother. The scores for both parents were averaged to
represent perceived parental support and the overall internal consistency reliability was .93.
Perceived conﬂict with parents
Perceived conﬂict with parents was measured using the conﬂict
scale in the PEQ (Elkins et al., 1997) which consists of 12 items for
father and mother separately. This scale assesses the extent to
which the parent–child relationship is characterized by disagreement, tension, and anger. Sample items include ‘‘My parent often
criticized me” and ‘‘There were often misunderstandings between
this parent and myself”. Responses were scored such that higher
scores indicate a higher level of perceived conﬂict with the parent.
The internal consistency reliability was .91 for father and .90 for
mother. The scores for both parents were averaged to represent
perceived conﬂict with parents, with an overall internal consistency reliability of .93.
To ensure that the self-reported measures on perceived parental
support and perceived conﬂict with parents are measuring distinct
constructs, we conducted conﬁrmatory factor analysis on the
items. To maintain a favorable indicator-to-sample-size ratio, we
randomly divided the 12 items for each of the two variables into

121

four parcels before entering them into the CFA. For both mother
and father, the hypothesized two-factor models show a better ﬁt
(v2 = 49.9 and 91.3, df = 19 and 19, CFI = .99 and .97, TLI = .98 and
.96, RMSEA = .06 and .06 for mother and father, respectively), than
the model in which all the items loaded on a single factor
(v2 = 478.2 and 622.0, df = 20 and 20, CFI = .78 and .78, TLI = .68
and .69, RMSEA = .23 and .26 for mother and father, respectively).
After father and mother data were combined, the hypothesized
four-factor model shows a better ﬁt (v2 = 392.8, df = 94, CFI = .95,
TLI = .94, RMSEA = .07) than the two-factor model in which perceived parental support and conﬂicts with parents are combined
to load onto a factor for mother and another factor for father
(v2 = 1143.5, df = 99, CFI = .77, TLI = .72, RMSEA = .18). Based on
these results we believe the two self-reported family environmental variables are distinct from each other.
Analyses
All analyses were conducted using the statistical software
Mplus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2007). The three environmental
variables were ﬁrst examined to assess the genetic inﬂuences, if
any, on each variable. Most environmentally induced variables also
reﬂect genetic variability (Plomin & Bergeman, 1991), a phenomenon referred to as gene–environment correlations (G–E). G–E correlations may complicate the study of G  E interaction because
the existence of G–E correlations makes it difﬁcult to obtain a pure
measure of the environment, since the measure itself may be
genetically inﬂuenced (Rutter et al., 1997). We used a strategy offered by previous researchers to deal with G–E correlations while
testing for G  E (Purcell, 2002), i.e., we directly test a bivariate
moderation model that incorporates the proposed moderator and
the dependent variable.
If an environmental variable is genetically inﬂuenced, we use
bivariate moderation models (Purcell, 2002) to examine the extent
of G–E association between the genetic factors inﬂuencing the
moderator and the leadership variable. That is, a series of nested
models are compared and the most parsimonious model is chosen
to examine the necessity of using such bivariate models. The lack
of common paths linking the moderator and the dependent variable can ensure that the environmental/moderator variable is independent of the genetic factors associated with the dependent
variable. In these cases, the moderating tests based on the more
parsimonious univariate moderation models are unbiased (Plomin
et al., 1977; Purcell, 2002).
Univariate analyses on the potential moderators
We ﬁrst conducted tests to examine whether the three potential
moderators are purely environment-induced. Speciﬁcally, we conducted univariate quantitative genetic analyses to estimate the
latent genetic components as well as environmental components
in the variances of the moderators. The univariate models aim at
partitioning the observed between-individual variance in a speciﬁc
behavioral construct into additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and non-shared (E) environmental variances. The nonshared environmental variance represents residual variance not
explained by either of the other two sources, along with measurement error. In particular, the equation predicting leadership role
occupancy (Ti) for twin i in each twin pair is

T i ¼ l þ aA þ cC þ eE;

ð1Þ

where A, C, E are independent latent factors with variance 1 and
mean zero, a, c, e are their corresponding coefﬁcients to be estimated, and l represents the intercept. Based on Eq. (1), the variance
of Ti is decomposed into three components a2, c2, and e2, and the
heritability can be estimated as h2 = a2/(a2 + c2 + e2), which represents the proportion of total variance that is due to genetic factors.

<-----Page 4----->122

ate, bivariate, and moderation analyses, we compared series of
nested models in order to choose the best-ﬁtting models (based
on varies ﬁt indexes) to examine the moderating effects.

In the two-group structural equation models, the genetic factors
between the two twins correlate at r = 1.0 in the identical twins
group because identical twins share 100% of their genes. For the
fraternal twins group the genetic factors correlated at r = .5
because, on average, fraternal twins share 50% of their genes. The
correlations between common environmental factors are, by deﬁnition, 1.0 for both groups. The potential moderators were separately analyzed using the univariate model based on Eq. (1).

Bivariate moderation analyses
If an environmental variable shows signiﬁcant genetic inﬂuence
(i.e., a signiﬁcant h2), we conduct analyses using bivariate moderation models recommended by Purcell (2002). Fig. 2 provides an
illustration of the bivariate moderation model in which the moderator variable is decomposed into its genetic and environmental
variance components and tested for gene–environment interaction
in the presence of gene–environment correlation (Purcell, 2002).
In this model, the paths expressing the genetic and environmental inﬂuences on the moderator variable are considered constant. The common paths, rather than aM, cM, eM, are the focus of
our investigation. Using the genetic factors as an example, both
the common genetic effect between the moderator and leadership
and the unique genetic effects on leadership are partitioned into a
mean part that is independent of the moderator (ac and au, respectively), and a part that is a linear function of the moderator (bXcM

Univariate moderation analyses
The method of variance decomposition in Eq. (1) reﬂects an
averaged estimate on the heritability of a construct because the
standard univariate ACE model assumes that the A, C, and E components are ﬁxed over the entire population from which the sample is drawn. Following previous research (e.g., Turkheimer et al.,
2003), our moderation analyses incorporated moderators to Eq.
(1) such that the A, C, and E effects are made dependent on the
moderator variable. The magnitude of the variance components
varies as a continuous function of the moderator variable. The
equation predicting leadership role occupancy for twin i in each
twin pair is now

T i ¼ l þ bM Mi þ ða þ bX Mi ÞA þ ðc þ bY Mi ÞC þ ðe þ bZ Mi ÞE;

ð2Þ

where Mi represents the moderator variable and bM represents the
main effect of the moderator on the mean of the dependent variable; a, c, and e are the main effects; and bX, bY, and bZ represent
the moderating coefﬁcients for genetic, shared environmental, and
non-shared environmental variance, respectively.
Fig. 1 illustrates the conceptual path diagram for the moderated
model. Application of standard path-tracing rules to the path model results in the structural equation speciﬁed by Eq. (2). The heritability estimate is still the proportion of total variance that is due to
genetic factors, but is now a non-linear function of M, rather than a
population-average estimate for all the participants.

and bXuM, respectively). Similar conﬁgurations are speciﬁed for the
shared and non-shared environmental factors.
The moderator can take the same value or different values for
the two twins in a pair (Purcell, 2002). The extent to which the
moderator variable moderates the variance in leadership is measured on all six paths. The nested models were derived by successively ﬁxing the moderation and/or main effect coefﬁcients to zero.
As Purcell (2002) contends, the genetic effects on the moderator
only matters when these genetic factors are shared with the
dependent variable under investigation. If the common paths’
main effect and moderation coefﬁcients can be ﬁxed to zero without reducing the model ﬁt, the bivariate moderation models can be
reduced to the more parsimonious univariate moderation models.
To establish convergent validity, we also conducted analyses on
each of the two measures for the composite variable of leadership
role occupancy, i.e., leadership positions at work and leadership
positions in work-related associations. Highly similar results were
found for these two indicators as compared with results for the
composite measure. We thus only report the results for the composite measure below.
Results
Table 1 provides the sample sizes, means, standard deviations,
and individual-level correlations of the variables of this study.
Perceived parental support was signiﬁcantly correlated with perceived conﬂict with parents (r = .61, p < .001). None of the three
environmental variables was signiﬁcantly correlated with leadership role occupancy. The absence of signiﬁcant correlations between the leadership variable and the environmental moderators
provides preliminary support for the lack of confounding effects
from gene–environment correlations.
Table 2 provides a comparison between MZ twins and DZ twins
on the key variables in this study. MZ twins do not differ from DZ
twins in terms of the mean levels on SES, perceived parental support, perceived conﬂict with parents, and leadership role occupancy. Levene’s tests show that MZ and DZ twins have equal
variances on the four variables. To further explore the data structure, we calculated twin correlations for the leadership variable
at different levels of the three moderators. High and low conditions
of a particular moderator were determined as above and below the
mean, respectively. As shown in Table 3, the difference between

MZ and DZ correlations are larger when SES is low, perceived
parental support is low, or perceived conﬂict with parents is high.
These correlations provide preliminary results on the moderating
effects of the three moderator variables.
Before we formally test the moderation effects, we estimated
whether the environmentally induced moderator variables (perceived parent support and perceived conﬂict with parents) are free
of genetic inﬂuences and then examined potential confounding effects of G–E correlations. Since the family socioeconomic status
variable has the same value for the two twins in a pair, the SES variable cannot have any genetic inﬂuence. Thus, SES is excluded from
the analysis of genetic inﬂuence on the moderator variables. A series of nested model testing was conducted, and the best-ﬁtting
model was chosen based on chi-square change and a variety of
ﬁt indexes. As Table 4 shows, AE models ﬁt the data for perceived
parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents. The genetic
components for the perceived parental support variable and perceived conﬂict with parents variable were estimated at .64 and
.56, respectively, both with 95% conﬁdence intervals excluding
zero. Thus, we found signiﬁcant genetic inﬂuences on perceived
parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents. Based on
these ﬁndings, we then proceed to conduct bivariate moderation
analyses on the effects of perceived parental support and perceived
conﬂict with parents on leadership role occupancy. It is notable
that Table 4 also reports the univariate model estimates on leadership role occupancy based on the current data set. Similar results
have been reported in Arvey et al. (2006) using a slightly larger
sample of the twins.
Bivariate moderation analyses were conducted to examine the
extent of G  E interactions in the potential presence of G–E correlations. Table 5 reports the model ﬁt for a series of nested models
for both moderators. In Model 3 for perceived parental support, the
moderation and main effect coefﬁcients for the common A, C, and E
paths can be ﬁxed at zero without causing worse ﬁt as compared to
the full model. Thus, the bivariate moderation model can be
reduced to a univariate moderation model without biasing the results. This univariate A, C, and E moderation model can be further
reduced to a model with only A and E paths (Model 5). Similar
results were obtained for perceived conﬂict with parents. Consequently, although perceived parental support and perceived conﬂict with parents are genetically inﬂuenced, there is little
evidence for G–E correlation between the genetic factors that

among a series of nested moderation models. The full ACE model
was based on Eq. (2). In the CE models the path coefﬁcients a
and bX were ﬁxed at zero, and in the AE models the path c and bY
were ﬁxed at zero. As Table 6 shows, the AE moderation models
exhibit the best ﬁt for each of the three moderating variables. In
particular, the 2 Log-likelihood change between the ACE model
and the CE model was 9.23 (Ddf = 2, p < .01), 12.06 (Ddf = 2,
p < .001), and 64.33 (Ddf = 2, p < .001) for perceived parent support,
perceived conﬂict with parents, and SES, respectively. The AE models show insigniﬁcant changes in 2 Log-likelihood and demonstrate the lowest values for AIC and sample-size adjusted BIC.
To ensure that our ﬁndings are not the results of non-normality
or some extreme data points in our dependent variable, we used
two methods to transform the leadership variable and re-ran the
analyses. First, we log-transformed the leadership variable so that
the transformed variable shows less skewness (skewness = .05).
Second, and independent from the ﬁrst method, we trimmed the
leadership variable so that data points beyond the range of ±2 SD
were set to the boundary values. Moreover, bias-corrected bootstrapping (with 500 replications) was used in all the analyses to
provide 95% conﬁdence intervals for the estimates, which is an
advantageous method compared to the normality-based conﬁdence intervals (e.g., Taylor, MacKinnon, & Tein, 2008). These two
approaches provided results highly similar to those based on our
original operationalization, showing the robustness of the results.

The path coefﬁcient estimates based on the AE moderation
models are reported in Table 7. Signiﬁcant values for bX reveal substantial moderating effects of the moderator on the genetic inﬂuences on leadership. As Table 7 shows, SES signiﬁcantly and
negatively moderates the genetic inﬂuence on leadership role
occupancy (bX = .39; 95% bias-corrected bootstrapped conﬁdence
intervals: .70 to .12). To facilitate the interpretation of the
results, we report the model-predicted genetic and non-shared
environmental inﬂuences on leadership under three conditions of
SES (see Table 8). In particular, when SES takes the value of 1.0
SD, the mean, and +1.0 SD, the corresponding genetic inﬂuence is
.76, .18, and .01, respectively.
Fig. 3 shows the moderating effects of SES on the genetic and
non-shared environmental variances of the leadership variable.
To derive the genetic component of the leadership variable at
different levels of the moderator, we generated random values of
the moderator within ±1.0 SD from its mean, and entered these values in Eq. (3) along with the path coefﬁcient estimates from Table 7

(i.e., a, bX, e, and bZ). The environmental component of the variance
of leadership role occupancy was calculated in an equation with
the environmental variance, rather than genetic variance, as the
numerator. The genetic and environmental components of the variance of the leadership variable were then plotted against different
levels of SES within ±1.0 SD from its mean. As Fig. 3 shows, with the
increase of SES (which is a standardized variable), the genetic
effects on leadership decrease and the non-shared-environmental
effect increase.
Perceived parental support also negatively moderates the
genetic inﬂuence on leadership role occupancy (bX = .29; 95%
bootstrapped CI: .48 to .05, see Table 7); this result indicates
that the heritability of leadership role occupancy is greater in magnitude for individuals who perceived having lower perceived
parental support, as shown in Table 8. Fig. 4 illustrates the moderating effect of perceived parental support on the genetic and environmental inﬂuences on leadership role occupancy. Similar to the
graph for SES, the genetic and environmental components of the

variance of leadership role occupancy were then plotted against
different levels of perceived parental support within ±1.0 SD from
its mean. As Fig. 4 shows, with the increase of perceived parental
support (a standardized variable), the genetic effects decrease
and the non-shared-environmental effects increase.
Perceived conﬂict with parents positively moderated the genetic effect on leadership role occupancy (bX = .26; 95% CI: .10 to .46).
Table 8 and Fig. 5 show the moderating effect of the conﬂict variable within the range of one standard deviation from the mean.
With the increase of perceived conﬂict with parents, the genetic
effects on the leadership variable increase and the non-sharedenvironmental effects decrease.
Discussion
Our investigation into the role of social environmental factors in
explaining the magnitude of genetic inﬂuences on leadership role
occupancy led to consistent ﬁndings supporting the view that the
presence of adversity and conﬂict facilitates the greater inﬂuence
of genetic leadership potential. First, family SES, as an indirect
measure of the quality of the environment during adolescence
(indicating availability of resources), negatively moderated the ge-

netic effects on leadership role occupancy, such that the genetic effects were higher for those from low-SES families. Second,
perceptions of parental support and conﬂict with parents, as subjective indicators of the social/family environment in adolescence,
also had signiﬁcant moderating effects on the heritability of leadership role occupancy (negative for perceived parental support
and positive for perceived conﬂict with parents), such that the genetic effects were higher for those reporting lower levels of perceived parental support and higher levels of perceived conﬂict
with parents.
Although much remains to be understood, our study shows
that the economic and social characteristics of the environments
that individuals experience in adolescence have important inﬂuences on the magnitude of genetic inﬂuences on leadership manifested later in life. The relative importance of genetic versus
environmental factors in causing differences in observed leadership role occupancy appears to vary with SES, perceived parental
support, and perceived conﬂict with parents. More enriched
parental environments—characterized by higher SES, higher levels
of perceived parental support, and lower perceived conﬂict with
parents—were associated with a lower heritability of leadership
role occupancy.
As noted, these ﬁndings are consistent with the conceptual
argument proposing that the presence of adversity and conﬂict
allows for a greater inﬂuence of genetic differences in capabilities
related to leadership, and it is inconsistent with previous research
on the moderating effect of characteristics of the early environment on intelligence (e.g., Turkheimer et al., 2003), which found
that enriched family environments led to higher heritability on
intelligence. We believe these contrasting results indicate the substantial differences between these two constructs. Based on 65
studies, Judge, Colbert, and Ilies (2004, p. 546) only found a low
true correlation between paper-and-pencil intelligence and leadership emergence (q = .19, uncorrected for range restriction, and
q = .25 corrected for range restriction). Whereas leadership skills
can be taught and leadership potential can be developed, intelligence is believed to be much less malleable than leadership (e.g.,
Sternberg & Kaufman, 1998). Moreover, leadership skills are by
nature interpersonal; thus, learning and developmental interventions are important for individuals to develop these skills. Intelligence, on the other hand, is an intrapersonal ability construct,
and exhibits a high degree of between-individual stability across
the life span (e.g., Cardon, Fulker, DeFries, & Plomin, 1992). For
example, Deary, Whalley, Lemmon, Crawford, and Starr (2000)
and Larsen, Hartmann, and Nyborg (2008) found that the between-individual differences in intelligence have substantial stability from childhood to late life. The correlation between two
test scores at age 11 and age 77 was .63 (Deary et al., 2000), and
the correlations between intelligence measures accessed 18 years
apart ranged from .79 to .85 (Larsen et al., 2008).

Conflict with Parents

The ﬁndings in this study suggest that a model in which leadership variance is merely partitioned into components attributable to
genes and environmental effects lacks the capability to examine
the dynamic interaction of genetic effects and developmental environments. As this study shows, examining G  E interactions can
pinpoint the moderating relationships and show how the social
environment interacts with genetic predispositions. When an individual lived in a family with higher parental support or lower conﬂict with parents, his/her opportunities of becoming a leader in the
workplace were determined more by environmental factors rather
than by genetic factors. In this sense, it is possible that creating
more enriched environments for adolescents ‘‘levels the playing
ﬁeld”, at least to some extent, such that whether one was born

<-----Page 9----->Z. Zhang et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 118–128

with the ‘‘right” attributes for leadership matters less in the enriched environments.
In the current study, we focus on the interaction between genes
and the environment. We neither predict nor ﬁnd any main effects
of the environmental variables on leadership role occupancy at
work, and the correlations between the environmental variables
and leadership were not signiﬁcant. The absence of these main effects can mitigate the concerns on the confounding effects of G–E
correlations.
These ﬁndings on G  E interaction on leadership have signiﬁcant implications for leadership training and development in organizations. This study suggests that leadership development efforts
in earlier life can matter even though leadership is inﬂuenced by
genetic factors. It is known, for example, that transformational
leaders can be developed to some extent (Barling, Weber, & Kelloway, 1996). Our ﬁndings suggest that early development interventions are likely to be more successful when they are accompanied
by a resource-rich, supportive social environment. Nevertheless, it
remains to be seen if development programs implemented later in
life (at work) are more successful for those who experienced more
enriched environments in adolescence, which would indicate that
providing increased support and opportunities for adolescents may
lead to more successful leadership development interventions later
at work.
This study has several limitations. First, the self-reported measures of leadership role occupancy and perceived parental environment in adolescence may share common method variance.
However, this concern is somewhat alleviated by the time lag
among the measures (i.e., perceived parental environment
measures were collected three years before the leadership data)
and the method of computing the heritability of leadership role
occupancy (based on correlations between independent reports
of twins). In addition, the fact that the main objective of the study
was to uncover the moderating effects on heritability estimates
should further relieve concerns about this potential common rater
problem.
Second, the subjective measures on family environments in
adolescence may be subject to retrospective bias. Because holding
more or less leadership roles is not likely to affect a person’s memory retrieval with regard to their parental environments during
adolescence, we believe any bias or inaccuracy in the retrospective
measures of family environment would actually reduce the power
of ﬁnding G  E interactions. Thus, the potential inaccuracies in
memory retrieval may make our results conservative. Third, the
study utilized white male twins born between 1961 and 1964.
While narrowing down the age range and focusing on males could
help to partial out the confounding effect of age and gender, the
degree to which these ﬁndings generalize to females or other racial
groups is unknown. These results need replication to afﬁrm the
stability of the relationships observed before we can generalize
the results to a broader population.
Fourth, while we utilized ratings of objective characteristics of
the family SES (i.e., father’s occupation and mother’s education),
our measures of parental support and conﬂict with parents for
the twins are inherently perceptual. Rater effects are probably
responsible, in part, for the presence of genetic effects on these
two ‘‘environmental” variables. Given the fact that our results
suggest that G–E correlation did not substantially inﬂuence the
G  E results, and that our analyses controlled for the main effects of ‘‘E” variables (and thus for their genetic component),
we believe our results are informative in terms of demonstrating
differential genetic inﬂuences under different environments. Similar measures on perceived environment and the same analytical
approach have been used in prior studies on G  E interactions
(e.g., perceived marital quality, South & Krueger, 2008). In addition, although the bootstrapping approach we used provided con-

127

ﬁdence interval estimates that are free of distribution
assumptions, our dependent variable was not measured on an
interval scale, which may reduce the variability of the measure.
Future research needs to use interval-scale measures that ﬁt with
analytical methods based on normal distribution assumptions.
Moreover, in replicating the results, future research needs to utilize larger samples of twins that provide increased statistical
power to detect G  E interactions in the presence of G–E
correlations.
This study’s limitations should be considered vis-à-vis its innovativeness and contributions. This study attests to the importance
of the adolescent social environment in the development of leadership potential later in life and is the ﬁrst study to consider the
role of the earlier developmental environment in inﬂuencing the
genetic effect on leadership role occupancy at work. The results
showed that workplace leadership role occupancy is less affected
by genetic factors, and more affected by the environment, for
those who had enriched and supportive environments. Early
developmental factors, leading to favorable, opportunity-rich
environments, may be especially important to the success of
those who are not equipped with natural leadership endowments,
by allowing them to more effectively capitalize on opportunities
later in life.
