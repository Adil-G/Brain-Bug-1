Agency theory suggests that an efficient contract between a franchisor (principal) and a franchisee (agent) could be established by the use of selection
criteria that would screen prospective franchisees based on their likely future
outcomes desired by their franchisors. Franchisors can use franchisee selection criteria as a key input control to enhance the outcomes of their future
franchisees. This article examines the relationship between key franchisee
selection criteria such as franchisees’ financial capability, experience and management skills, demographic characteristics, attitude toward business dimensions (perceived innovativeness, desire for personal development, seek work-related challenges, personal commitment to the business, and business
risk-taking), and key measures of outcomes desired by franchisors (perceived cooperation, satisfaction
with the business decision, and franchisee opportunism). The findings show that certain franchisee attitudes toward business can be used as an effective input control strategy by franchisors because they explain
a substantial portion of the variance in franchisees’ outcome desired by franchisors.  1999 Elsevier

(Justis and Judd 1989). The future success of the franchisor’s system depends to an important degree on a systematic screening process used to ensure careful selection of
good prospects to conduct the business of the franchisor (Poe 1991; Olm et al. 1988).
The success of the franchisor and the franchisee are mutually dependent, and, therefore,
it is imperative that each give full consideration to the selection of their “partners” in
business (Tatham et al. 1972). Thus, the ideal in building and maintaining a high quality
network of franchisees is a selection method that would qualify prospective franchisees
based on their likely future performance.
The franchise system of distribution may better suit the needs of some prospective
franchisees than others. Some franchisees prosper, stay within their franchise system,
and make major contributions to the success of their firms and their franchise systems.
Conversely, other franchisees fail in all these areas. It would be very valuable to both
franchisors and prospective franchisees if franchisors were able to identify and select
the successful franchisees from a pool of prospective franchisee applicants.
Axelrad and Rudnick (1987) still note that it is unfortunate that no reliable screening and selection system has yet been devised, and the selection has been largely a matter
of subjective judgment.1 In spite of the recognized importance of the franchisee selection
process, very little scholarly attention has been focused on the relevant theory development, the selection criteria themselves, and empirical testing of these criteria. Such information would be of considerable assistance to both franchisors and franchisees in
their deliberations to enter franchise agreements.
This research is designed to provide this desired information. Specifically, the objectives of this study are fourfold: (1) to develop the theory that is applicable, (2) to
identify and develop selection criteria to serve as an input control strategy for franchisors, (3) to develop measures for the appropriate selection criteria, and (4) to test the
proposed relationships between these selection criteria and various outcomes measures.

SELECTION CRITERIA AS AN INPUT CONTROL STRATEGY
Control is recognized as an important facet of organizational design (Eisenhardt 1985).
Franchisors generally need to have wide-ranging control over their franchisees to enhance performance of the franchise system. Agency theory provides valuable insights
into the reasons for the control problems and how to develop strategies to enhance the
performance of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The franchisor-franchisee relationship can be construed as an agency relationship as the principal (franchisor) depends
on another party (franchisee) to undertake actions on the principal’s behalf. The primary focus of the theory is on determining the most efficient contract to govern a particular relationship given the characteristics of the parties involved and the fact that it is
difficult for the franchisor to monitor the franchisee completely because of uncertainty
and the cost of obtaining information about the franchisee (Bergen et al. 1992).
Agency theory defines efficiency from the principal’s (franchisor) point of view.
The efficient contract is one that brings the best possible outcome desired by the franchi1
Dynamic Performance Systems Inc. has developed Franchisee Potential Profile—a commercial tool
to measure attitudes of the prospective franchisees and their relationship to franchisee’s probable level of
success (sales and fit with their franchisors). First, the tool is used to evaluate existing franchisees in a franchise
system and benchmark successful franchisees. Then it is used to evaluate prospective franchisees and predict
their outcomes. Even though the evaluation tool is commercially available, there is very little available in
the published literature. Our goal is to contribute to the literature on this topic.

sor given the constraints imposed by the situation. There are primarily two types of
agency (control) problems to establish an efficient contract. They are (1) precontractual
problems and (2) postcontractual problems.
The precontractual or “adverse selection” problems arise before the franchisor decides to offer a contract to the franchisee. The major issues are whether a particular
prospective franchisee has the characteristics the franchisor is seeking and what strategy
should the franchisor employ to find out (Bergen, Dutta, and Walker 1992). This is the
problem that franchisors face when recruiting new franchisees. Based on the desired
characteristics of the franchisee, the franchisor should identify and select the appropriate franchisees as agents who will work in the best interests of the franchisor. The
use of selection criteria to choose among potential franchisees can be viewed as an input
control mechanism. In the franchising context, controlling the quality of the franchisees
through stringent selection criteria would enhance the performance of the system and
reduce long-term monitoring costs for the franchisor (Bergen, Dutta, and Walker 1992).
It is very desirable for franchisors to select franchisees who will work in the best
interest of the franchisor. Cooperation between the franchisor and the franchisee is essential for the franchise system to grow and prosper as a network (Achrol 1996).
Franchisors need franchisees who view the relationship cooperatively and have the ability and willingness to follow the decisions, policies and daily routines laid down by them
(Wattel 1968–69). A cooperative environment should enhance coordination and thus
lead to superior performance of the franchise system. A sense of working together and
helping each other is important for the success of both the franchisor and the franchisee
(Whittemore 1994). Agency theory suggests that screening appropriate candidates with
cooperative tendencies will reduce the pre-contractual problems and also ongoing postcontractual problems. Thus, having cooperative relationships with franchisees can reduce the agency costs (coordination and adaptation costs) for the franchisor.
Franchisors would also like to have franchisees who feel that they made the right
decision when they chose to become a franchisee. Satisfaction with their business decision to become a franchisee can serve to create superior economic performance and
thus a superior franchise system (Lusch 1977; Hunt and Nevin 1974; Lewis and Lambert
1991; Hing 1995). Those who are satisfied with the business decision to become a franchisee are more likely to work with their franchisor and have higher morale, and less likely
to seek other business opportunities, terminate the contract voluntarily, file individual
or class action suits against the franchisor, or seek protective legislation (Hunt and
Nevin 1974; Lewis and Lambert 1991). Thus, satisfaction with the business decision can
also reduce the agency costs.
The post-contractual or “moral hazard” problem evolves after the franchisor and
franchisee engage in the relationship. The franchisor should evaluate and reward the
franchisee’s performance such that the franchisee is motivated to behave in a manner
consistent with the franchisor’s goals. In order to do this, the franchisor should be able
to monitor the franchisee and develop incentive strategies to align the franchisee’s goals
to obtain the desired outcomes. In the franchise context, due to the diversity in the location of the franchises, the performance evaluation process is extremely difficult and expensive (Rubin 1978; Norton 1988). Furthermore, the contract becomes very inefficient
when the franchisee has conflicting goals, attitudes, and risk preferences compared to
the franchisor (Bergen, Dutta, and Walker 1992). This can lead to opportunistic behavior of the franchisee.
Williamson (1985: 47) defines opportunism as “self interest seeking with guile,”

<-----Page 3----->366

T. JAMBULINGAM AND J.R. NEVIN

and suggests that it includes such behaviors as lying and cheating, as well as more subtle
forms of deceit like violation of agreements. Opportunism is one of the key assumptions
of agency theory (Eisenhardt 1985). Opportunistic behavior of the agent (franchisee)
increases the agency costs to the principal (franchisor).
In the franchising context, opportunism poses a problem to the franchisor because
the franchisees’ might pursue divergent goals. For example, the franchisor will be considering the performance of the entire system while the franchisees might be focusing
on their individual outlets. A franchisee’s opportunism can create serious difficulties
for the harmonious franchisor-franchisee relationship (Gassenheimer et al. 1996). For
example, a franchisee can opportunistically exploit the situation by demanding various
kinds of concessions (quasi rent appropriation), and fail to adhere to the initial agreements by reducing the quality of the inputs (free riding) (Brickley and Dark 1987). If
the franchisee becomes opportunistic upon becoming a franchisee, then the bargaining
costs and enforcement of the contract costs for the franchisor increase. It is essential
for the franchisor to screen and select appropriate individuals as franchisees who are
likely to be less opportunistic in their behavior. One potential way to minimize these
post-contractual problems is to focus on the selection of the franchisees by screening
them adequately (Bergen, Dutta, and Walker 1992).
We argue that in the franchise channel system, franchisees who perceive the relationship with franchisors to be more cooperative, are more satisfied with their franchised
business decision, and behave less opportunistically, and are likely to contribute to the
success of a franchisor and the franchising system. These franchisee outcomes are especially important to franchisors given the increase in franchisor-franchisee disputes and
litigation. During the decade of the 1980s, the arbitration suits between franchisees and
franchisors increased six fold (Stern and Abelson 1991). Recently, franchisees have
been pushing for legislation to regulate the behavior of franchisors. This trend toward
increasing disputes should increase the importance for franchisors to identify franchisees who view the relationship more cooperatively, are more satisfied with their business
decision, and behave less opportunistically. Thus, selecting franchisees with these desirable outcomes can reduce both pre-contractual and post-contractual problems and create a superior coordinated franchising system.

THE FRANCHISEE SELECTION CRITERIA LITERATURE:
AN OVERVIEW
A search of the existing franchising literature was conducted to identify the criteria or
factors that franchisors either do consider or should consider in selecting among prospective franchisees. Although published research is scarce, some general guidelines
and criteria are offered as being useful for selecting among prospective franchisees. Industry guidelines and popular academic writings on franchising address these selection criteria.
The International Franchising Associations (IFA) code of ethics states that a member shall select and accept only those franchisees who, upon reasonable investigation,
appear to possess the basic skills, education, experience, personal characteristics, and
financial resources requisite to conduct the franchised business and meet the obligations
of the franchise under the franchise agreements (U.S. Department of Commerce 1991).
The guidelines provided by the IFA are broad in nature and do not specify either the

<-----Page 4----->FRANCHISEE SELECTION CRITERIA

367

relative importance or the required levels for each criteria to help franchisors make
better choices.
There are a few published studies that are specific in identifying important selection
criteria compared to the broad IFA guidelines. The selection criteria could be classified
into five broad categories: financial capability, experience and managerial factors, demographic factors, attitudes/personality, and other. The studies and the factors identified are shown in Table 1.
Several conclusions can be arrived at based on this literature review on franchisee
selection criteria. First, of the myriad of selection criteria that have been offered, most
of the factors identified in the previous studies can be grouped into the four categories
suggested by Olm et al. (1988): financial indicators, skills, background characteristics,
and attitudes/personality of the potential franchisees.
Second, though the attitudes/personality category is considered important in these
studies (Wattel 1968–69; Olm et al. 1988), no clear useful definition or domain of these
variables emerged from a review of the literature. The definitions of appropriate attitudes differed considerably among the various writers. One definition was whether the
prospective franchisee has the correct attitudes or mind set to be an entrepreneur (Justin
and Judd 1989). Another definition is whether the prospective franchisee has the attitude to work with people and win their respect (Tatham et al. 1972). Similarly, the domain of personality traits was also not clearly defined in the literature. Some of the personality traits suggested were motivation, aggressiveness, promotability, and people
skills (Axelrad and Rudnick 1987). Lack of a clear definition and domain of the constructs makes it extremely difficult to measure and assess them. In addition, attitudes
and personality are broad concepts and precise definition and measurement in this selection context is essential.
Third, none of the previous authors evaluated the proposed relationship between
screening criteria and desired franchisee outcomes. There seems to be no published
empirical support for the contention that these proposed selection criteria are actually
successful in selecting the potentially better performing franchisee. As indicated by Axelrad and Rudnick (1987), was no reliable screening and selection system devised, and
franchisee selection has been largely a matter of subjective judgement.

IDENTIFICATION OF SELECTION CRITERIA AND
HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT
Our review of the literature led to the conclusion that the four categories of selection
criteria identified by Olm et al. (1988) would serve as a framework for our empirical
study. Within this framework, we set out to define the key selection criteria to be used
in testing the proposed relationship with franchisee outcomes desired by the franchisor.
We relied on Olm et al. (1988) and Axelrad and Rudnick (1987) to identify the
individual factors under each of the four categories identified. In the following section
we develop the individual factors under each category and the relevant hypotheses to
be tested in this study.

Financial Capability
The financial position of the potential franchisee is the most important of the traditional
selection criteria used by franchisors (Olm et al. 1988). All previous studies have unani-

mously agreed on the importance of the financial condition of the prospective franchisee. Axelrad and Rudnick (1987) state that “for a prospective franchisee, before the first
scheduled meeting, the prospect should have demonstrated his willingness and ability to
meet the company’s financial requirements.” A key indicator of a prospective franchisee’s ability to meet financial requirements is the personal savings that he/she can invest
(Olm et al. 1988). Personal savings indicate that the franchisee values savings and has
previously acted in a financially responsible fashion.
Investment from personal savings serves to lock-in a franchisee’s capital and creates an ongoing dependence on the franchisor. In order to manage the dependence on
the franchisor, the franchisee should create a close relationship with the franchisor and
view the relationship more cooperatively. In addition, franchisees who commit a larger
proportion of financial resources from their personal savings should have researched
the franchisor thoroughly and hence be more satisfied with the decision to become a
franchisee. Because the franchisees invested assets from their personal savings they
should be less opportunistic toward the franchisor. Thus, the first hypotheses is:
H1: Investing a larger proportion from personal savings should be related (a) positively to perceived cooperation, (b) positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the
business decision, and (c) negatively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward
the franchisor.

Experience and Management Skills
The variables in this category are prior experience, prior self-employment, own other
businesses, and manage operations. These factors were extensively cited in the literature
as key factors used by franchisors in their selection process. Prior experience is defined
as the extent to which franchisees had previous experience in a similar business. There
were conflicting opinions about this variable found in the literature. Tatham et al.
(1972), Edens et al. (1976), and Olm et al. (1988) argued that prior experience is an
important selection criteria. Owen (1989) emphasized that franchisors should select
prospects with at least five years of prior business experience in similar businesses. An
opposing view was proposed by Axelrad and Rudnick (1987). They suggested that prior
experience in the same business as the franchisor may make it more difficult for the
franchisee to unlearn old ways and accept the new and different business standards of
the franchisor. A long standing policy of Wimpy, a fast food franchisor, is: Full training
is provided and potential franchisees are not required to have catering experience. In
fact, the company prefers to start with people new to the business who do not have preconceived ideas about running a catering operation (Franchise World 1978).
In this study we are faced with the dilemma of whether prior experience enhances
or is detrimental to franchisee outcomes. Consistent with Olm et al. (1988), we propose
that franchisees who have prior experience, based on their past experience, would know
what they are getting into, what it takes to be successful in a franchise system, and
whether their expectations would be met by the franchise system. They should perceive
the relationship with the franchisor as more cooperative, be satisfied with their business
decision and will be less opportunistic toward the franchisor. Thus,
H2: Prior experience should be related (a) positively to perceived cooperation, (b)
positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c) negatively
to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

<-----Page 7----->370

T. JAMBULINGAM AND J.R. NEVIN

The next factor is prior self-employment. In a study conducted by Felstead (1993),
over half of the franchisees surveyed cited independence as the primary motivator to
become franchisees. Similarly, Kaufmann and Stanworth (1995) found that prior selfemployed individuals are more likely to become franchisees. In this regard, prior selfemployment is a good indicator of capability to run a franchised business. Although
the opportunity to be one’s “own boss” is a frequently stated reason for acquiring a
franchise, the notion of business independence actually is to some extent inconsistent
with franchise ownership (Felstead 1993). A franchisee must understand that they will
be obliged to subordinate a certain level of business independence to the requirements,
restrictions, and business policies imposed by the franchise system. A question to be
answered is whether prior self-employment has a positive effect on desired franchisee
outcomes. None of the previous studies evaluated selection criteria against franchisee
outcome measures, and, therefore, validation of these claims remains to be assessed.
We propose that individuals who were self-employed prior to becoming a franchisee
would know what it takes to create a marketable product or service, promote, price,
distribute, and manage the business all by themselves. By making a choice of becoming a
franchisee they would appreciate the benefit they receive from the franchisor and would
work with the franchisor in a cooperative way, be satisfied with their business decision
and be less opportunistic toward the franchisor than those who did not own other businesses. Hence,
H3: Prior self-employment should be related (a) positively to perceived cooperation, (b) positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c) negatively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

Another factor to be considered is whether the franchisee currently owns other
businesses. Axelrad and Rudnick (1987) suggested that it is important to evaluate the
conflicting business affairs of franchisees because it will affect their commitment to the
business. Some require 100% ownership in order to ensure the franchisee’s commitment
and best efforts in operating the business (Axelrad and Rudnick 1987). Thus, involvement in other businesses may have a detrimental effect on the outcomes of the franchisee because it diffuses their commitment among other business endeavors. But in the
recent years we see more franchisees act more like investors, investing in several franchised businesses and not working exclusively with one franchise system. They see becoming a franchisee as an investment opportunity and want to benefit financially as
much as possible. They may not be highly committed to any one system as they have
alternative investment opportunities and their primary goal might be to maximize their
return on their investment dollars. Thus, we propose that franchisees who own other
businesses perceive the relationship with their franchisors to be less cooperative, are
less satisfied with their business decision, and exhibit more opportunistic behavior toward their franchisors.
H4: Owning other businesses should be related (a) negatively to perceived cooperation, (b) negatively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c)
positively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

Finally, several authors contend that personal management of day-to-day operations influences franchisee outcomes. Axelrad and Rudnick (1987) suggest that when
franchisees depend excessively on hired managers to run the business it usually results
in less-than-hoped-for performance. In fact, that is the reason why some franchisors

<-----Page 8----->FRANCHISEE SELECTION CRITERIA

371

grant franchises only to owner-operators (e.g., McDonalds). Tatham et al. (1972) also
identified managing operations personally as the second most important criteria in the
selection of the franchisees, following financial capability. Alternatively, there is a growing trend for franchisees to own multiple outlets, an average franchisee owns from 2.4
to 5 locations (Franchise Times 1995). This trend indicates that there is a segment of
franchisees who are primarily investors, who hire capable personnel to manage the operation, and who do not manage day-to-day operations. Thus, the question remains as
to whether there is a difference in franchisee outcomes between those who manage their
own operations and to those who do not. We hypothesize that franchisees who manage
their own operations will be more cooperative because they would be communicating
with the franchisor regularly and understand the franchise system better, be more satisfied with their business decision, and be less opportunistic toward the franchisor.
H5: Managing one’s own operations should be related (a) positively to perceived
cooperation, (b) positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and
(c) negatively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

Demographic Characteristics
Demographic characteristics are very tangible and accessible selection criteria that
franchisors use in selecting among prospective franchisees. Based on the literature
search, five common demographic characteristics were identified: age, gender, ethnicity,
education, and marital status. All these variables will be discussed in turn.
In general, franchisors prefer younger individuals compared to older individuals
in order to meet the physical demands of the business (Axelrad and Rudnick 1987).
For example, in fast food franchising the franchisees are expected to endure long hours
and be very industrious and hard working. Young adults would be more likely to have
the stamina to sustain the physical needs to run such a business over a longer time frame.
As they get older they might be less willing to work hard and perceive the relationship
as less cooperative with the franchisor. They would like to work less and earn more
and, therefore, be less satisfied with their decision to become a franchisee and they will
be more opportunistic toward their franchisor. Thus,
H6: Age should be related (a) negatively to perceived cooperation, (b) negatively to
franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c) positively to franchisee’s
opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

There is increasing interest in the role of gender and ethnicity influences on franchisee outcomes. Are men more cooperative, more satisfied with their business decision,
and less opportunistic than women or vice versa? Traditionally, there are more men
than women in franchising. In the last decade, there has been an infusion of more women
owning franchised businesses. There is considerable interest in women’s performance
as franchise owners. Conventional wisdom holds that women are likely to be more oriented towards relationships and possibly more understanding of their franchisor’s desires. For the null hypotheses, we propose that men would perceive the relationship
less cooperatively, be less satisfied with their business decision and more opportunistic
than women. Thus,
H7: Male gender status compared to female status should be related (a) negatively
to perceived cooperation, (b) negatively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business

<-----Page 9----->372

T. JAMBULINGAM AND J.R. NEVIN

decision, and (c) positively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the
franchisor.

There are conflicting opinions about the role that the level of a franchisee’s education plays in franchisee outcomes. Studies conducted by Tatham et al. (1972) and Olm
et al. (1988) showed that educational background is less important as a selection criteria.
On the other hand, Wattel (1968–69) in his exploratory study showed that educational
background is important because it would be easier to train franchisees with a higher
levels of educational background. We argue that those who are educated would weight
the costs and benefits of becoming a franchisee better than the less educated franchisees.
They would have done their research very thoroughly and would understand the system
very well. It could be expected that the more educated franchisees would be more cooperative with their franchisor, more satisfied with their decision to become a franchisee
and less opportunistic toward their franchisor. Thus,
H8: Higher levels of education should be related (a) positively to perceived cooperation, (b) positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c) negatively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

There is a strong interest in the role that ethnic background plays, if any, in franchisee performance. In the last decade there has been an increasing number of minorities
owning franchised businesses. Given the historical under-representation of minorities
in franchised businesses, it would not be surprising if minorities entering franchising
were initially somewhat skeptical about the treatment they could expect to receive from
their franchisors. This skepticism could make them more cautious and less trusting in
the initial stages of the relationship. The relationship between ethnicity and franchisee
outcomes will be explored in this study. We propose that majority franchisees compared
to minority franchisees should be more cooperative, more satisfied with their business
decision and less opportunistic toward their franchisors.
H9: Majority ethnic status compared to minority status should be related (a) positively to perceived cooperation, (b) positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the
business decision, and (c) negatively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward
the franchisor.

Finally, marital status was included to find out whether it makes a difference in
franchisee performance. Olm et al. (1988) showed that marital status is an important
criteria in the selection process. Married people were found to be more responsible with
their work. Further, they had the family support to help them in their business. Being
more responsible, the married franchisees should view their relationship more cooperatively, be more satisfied with their business decision and less opportunistic toward
their franchisor.
H10: Married status should be related (a) positively to perceived cooperation, (b)
positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision and (c) negatively
to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

Attitudes Toward Business
Franchisees’ attitudes toward business have been proposed as key indicators to be used
by franchisors in selecting among prospective franchisees (Axelrad and Rudnick 1987;
Olm et al. 1988). When a prospective franchisee possesses the appropriate attitudes to-

<-----Page 10----->FRANCHISEE SELECTION CRITERIA

373

ward business, the franchisor can maintain a good working relationship with the franchisee over the life of the business. In this study we did not include the personality dimensions as proposed by Olm et al. (1988).
In our study, attitudes toward business are defined as the general feeling toward
different aspects of the franchised business. We identified five dimensions of the attitudes toward business construct based on the literature (Axelrad and Rudnick 1987;
Olm et al. 1988; Poe 1990). They were perceived innovativeness, desire for personal
development, seek work-related challenges, personal commitment to the business, and
business risk-taking. These factors are closer to the conceptualization by Axelrad and
Rudnick (1987) compared to Olm et al. (1988). Olm et al. (1988) identified more personality dimensions compared to attitude toward business dimensions.

Perceived Innovativeness
Perceived innovativeness reflects a franchisee’s tendency to engage in and support new
ideas, novelty, experimentation, and creative processes that may result in new products
and services for the franchise system. Some studies advocate the idea that the franchisees should be innovators, while others refute it. For example, Weinrauch (1986) and
Axelrad and Rudnick (1987) support the innovative position of the franchisee. In their
view, an innovative franchisee will bring new ideas and product concepts that will be
beneficial to the franchise system. Strutton et al. (1995) found that franchisors who encourage the franchisees to be innovative found them to have a positive attitude toward
solidarity with their franchisors. On the other hand, Olm et al. (1988) found that, in
general, most franchisors have stringent rules and norms and do not have much latitude
for creativity and innovativeness, which are generally considered characteristics of entrepreneurs. Olm et al. (1988) also showed that franchisors do not primarily consider
franchisees as entrepreneurs, but rather as hard-working, industrious individuals. The
effect of a franchisee’s perceived innovativeness on desired outcomes will provide answers to this seeming contradiction. In contrast to Olm et al. (1988), our view is that
a person can be both entrepreneurial and hard-working. Supporting Axelrad and Rudnick’s (1987) contention, we propose that franchisees who have higher levels of perceived innovativeness would be more creative and understand how to coexist with the
franchisor and succeed in the franchise system. They would adapt better to the franchise
system and manage their resources effectively and find ways to be satisfied with their
decision to become a franchisee. Since they would recognize that their success is closely
tied to the success of the franchise system, they would be less opportunistic toward
the franchisor.
H11: Perceived innovativeness should be related (a) positively to perceived cooperation, (b) positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c)
negatively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

Desire for Personal Development
An understanding of the franchisee’s desire for personal development is considered essential in assessing the success of the ensuing franchising relationship (Axelrad and
Rudnick 1987). The desire for personal development, including the development of new
skills and advancing one’s growth, are essential characteristics that franchisors tradition-

ally expect from their franchisees. However, having franchisees with such a desire can
provide a negative impact on the performance of the franchise system. The desire for
personal development indicates the franchisee’s motivation for succeeding personally
which may not be good for the franchise system. Those who have desires for personal
development with their personal gains at heart might not be cooperative with their
franchisors, would be less satisfied with their business decision of becoming a franchisee
and more opportunistic toward the franchisor.
H12: Desire for personal development should be related (a) negatively to perceived
cooperation, (b) negatively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision,
and (c) positively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

Seek Work-Related Challenges
Like many other businesses, a franchised business needs franchisees who seek workrelated challenges. Olm et al. (1988) showed that franchisors prefer industrious, hardworking, and self-motivated individuals as prospective candidates. Franchisees that get
a thrill out of confronting challenges at work and think about how to improve their
chances for getting ahead should be an asset to a franchise system. A positive attitude
toward work-related challenges is essential for the success of the franchisee. Those who
seek work-related challenges would be cooperative, satisfied with their business decision, and less opportunistic toward their franchisors.
H13: Franchisees who seek work related challenges should be related (a) positively
to perceived cooperation, (b) positively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business
decision, and (c) negatively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the
franchisor.

Personal Commitment to the Business
Personal commitment to the franchised business is another aspect of attitudes toward
business. A franchised business requires very committed individuals to achieve high
performance (Poe 1991). Personal commitment to the business increases involvement
and generates the best effort from the committed franchisee, leading to improved performance (Withane 1991). Willingness to work long hours and sacrifice short-term
profits for long-term goals indicates commitment to the business (Axelrad and Rudnick
1987). Morgan and Hunt (1994) in a relational exchange context showed that commitment to the relationship increases cooperation. Commitment to the business in the franchising system is similar to commitment to a relationship. We argue that personal commitment to the business should have a positive relationship to cooperation, be positively
related to satisfaction with the business decision, and be negatively related to opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.
H14: Personal commitment to business should (a) perceive the relationship with the
franchisor as cooperative, (b) increase franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c) decrease franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

Business Risk-Taking
The last dimension of attitudes toward business is business risk-taking. There are conflicting observations of the role of business risk-taking in franchising. O’Donnell (1984)
stated that franchisees are people who value order and security above risk. His view
implies that potential franchisees should have a sense of security as they become franchisees and should feel that this business endeavor is less risky. Olm et al. (1988) suggests
that risk averse individuals are preferable in franchising compared to the risk takers.
Similarly, Withane (1991) found that risk-taking is an important attribute to be successful as a franchisee, but 60% of the franchisees thought being an independent businessman is more risky than being a franchisee. Thus, being a franchisee reduces the perceived risk compared to starting a self-owned business. In contrast, Gartner (1985)
observed that franchising may require more risk-taking than starting a small business
without the attachments of franchising. In this study, we evaluated the effect that the
franchisee’s attitude toward business risk-taking has on franchisee outcomes. We propose that franchisees who opt to enter franchising and who are risk-takers are going
to experiment with their philosophies of running a franchise business. As risk-takers
they might challenge the way business is conducted by franchisors. They would like to
take risk, and, therefore, they may not like to conduct the business in the specific way
suggested by the franchisors. Because their opportunity to take risk is curtailed, they
might be less satisfied in a franchise system and be more opportunistic toward their
franchisors.
H15: Business risk taking should be related (a) negatively to perceived cooperation,
(b) negatively to franchisee’s satisfaction with the business decision, and (c) positively to franchisee’s opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

There are also questions pending as to how important the different categories of
selection criteria are in differentiating potentially higher outcome franchisees from
lower outcome franchisees. We believe that a prospective franchisee’s attitudes toward
business (ATB) should be the most influential category of selection criteria.
There are several supporting arguments for this belief. The literature has indicated
that attitudes and personality traits are important, but it does not really identify the
specific components that have potential to be used by franchisors. We developed the
construct of attitude toward business (ATB) by identifying five dimensions as subsets
of the attitudes/personality category. Each dimension of ATB is intended to address
an essential quality that a franchisee should possess to perform well in a franchised business. We propose that a franchisee’s ATB dimensions are relatively more important
in explaining franchisee outcomes than other screening criteria identified in this study.
The hypothesis to be tested is as follows:
H16: ATB dimensions are more important than financial capability, experience,
management skills, and demographic characteristics in explaining franchisee perceived cooperation, satisfaction with the business decision, and opportunistic behavior toward the franchisor.

The test of this hypothesis will provide an empirical basis for assessing the claimed usefulness of both the categories of selection criteria as well as the individual criteria in
each of these categories.

Methodology
The primary objective of this study is to test the relationship between the independent
variables and the franchisee outcome variables. Some researchers suggest that ideally
prospective franchisees should be studied longitudinally on their attitudes and intentions in order to profile successful franchisees (Kaufmann and Stanworth 1995). Even
though this method has merit, we did not have access to prospective franchisees. In
addition, only franchisees who are already in the system have outcome measures. Some
researchers (Justis et al. 1993) suggest that profiling ongoing franchisees on their behaviors and their characteristics would be a feasible and realistic method to identify successful franchisees. Profiling existing franchisees will provide the benchmark for successful
franchisees. Thus, our study is cross-sectional in nature and is based on information
gathered from ongoing franchisees who were in their first three years of operation in
order to limit their experience effects. In addition, we statistically controlled for the
three years of experience effects by using age of the business relationship as a control variable.

Research Design
The research design was a descriptive study using a cross-sectional sample of current
franchisees. The study consists of a large sample of franchisees from five franchise business categories: fast food, automotive products and services, business services, maintenance and cleaning services, and non-food retailing. These categories were selected
after reviewing the practitioner literature for the categories being projected as possessing high “growth potential” for the future (Franchising in the Economy 1992). In
addition, we compared a much larger number of franchise business categories on their
average growth in units, average growth rate in category sales dollars, and average
growth rate in sales dollars per unit. The comparison data for the five selected categories
of franchised business we studied are shown in Table 2.
A mailing list of franchisees was obtained from FRANDATA, a commercial franchise industry research and information provider headquartered in Washington D.C.
FRANDATA maintains a National Franchisee Mailing List of over 100,000 franchisees
compiled and updated monthly directly from Uniform Franchise Offering Circulars
(UFOCs). Although coverage of North American franchisors is not exhaustive, extensive research indicated that FRANDATA’s database was the most complete available.
This listing does not include company-owned units. We selected a sample frame of 1,500

from each of the five selected categories, resulting in a total mailing list of 7,500 franchisees. The franchisee database was examined for duplicate records by comparing telephone numbers for each record. Thirty-three duplicate records were eliminated using
this screening mechanism, leaving a sampling frame of 7,467 franchisees. In the mailing
process, 30 additional records were rejected for various reasons (e.g., incomplete address) resulting in a final mailing list of 7,437.

Data Collection
Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire sent to 7,437 franchisees.
The use of franchisees as the key informants was appropriate given the nature of the
business studied (Campbell 1955; John and Reve 1982). No reminder letters were mailed
after the questionnaire. Six hundred and thirty-two completed surveys were returned
for an usable response rate of 8.4%. Of the 632 responses, 154 responses were from
the franchisees who were in business three years or less. To assess non-response bias,
a random sample of 200 non-respondents for each of the five industries was generated.
A telephone questionnaire was developed to cover the key elements in the main survey.
The telephone surveys were conducted until 30 responses were achieved in each of the
five categories of franchise businesses.
The assessment of non-response bias (Armstrong and Overton 1977; Lambert and
Harrington 1990) showed no significant differences (p , 0.05) between respondents and
non-respondents on key criteria such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, prior selfemployment, manage operations, and items from the different dimensions of ATB.

Sample Characteristics
Of the 154 completed responses, 12.3% came from the fast food category, 20.1% from
automotive services, 28.6% from business services, 27.3% from maintenance, and
11.7% from non-food retail. Of the total number of respondents, 73.5% were direct unit
franchisees, 24.5% were territorial franchisees, 0.7% subfranchisees and 1.3% master
franchisees.2 A summary of the respondents’ characteristics is shown in Table 3.
2
A direct unit franchise grants a franchisee the right to operate a single business outlet at one specific
location or within a defined territory. A territorial franchise grants a franchisee the right to develop multiple
franchise businesses within a defined territory. A subfranchise grants a subfranchisor the right to franchise
the franchiser’s business within a defined territory to one or more subfranchisees. A master franchise grants
a master franchisee the right to solicit prospective franchisees, within a defined territory, for the franchisor.

Measures
Franchisee Outcomes
Franchisee outcome measures were cooperation, satisfaction with the business decision,
and opportunism toward the franchisor. We used multiple items to measure the constructs. Because behavior is based on perceptions rather than objective measures of
interaction (Anderson, Lodish, and Weitz 1987; Roberts and O’Reilly 1974), the measures tapped the franchisees perceptions of the relationship and business outcomes. A
description of the measures is given below (see Appendix A).
Cooperation was hypothesized to have a more complex underlying factor structure.
Heide and Miner (1992) identified four dimensions of cooperation: information exchange, flexibility, problem solving, and restraint of power. Based on the conceptualization of cooperation suggested by Heide and Miner (1992) we used three dimensions
(information exchange, flexibility, and problem solving) to access cooperation in the
relationship between the franchisees and franchisors. The items of the information exchange scale expressed the extent to which each party discloses information that might
help the other party’s activities. The flexibility items measured the degree to which the
parties typically adjust in the ongoing relationship in accordance with the changing circumstances. Finally, the problem solving scale measured the extent to which the parties
make an effort to solve the problem. The three domains contribute to an overarching
construct of cooperation. All the multi-item cooperation constructs were measured on
a five-point Likert scale.
Satisfaction with the business decision assesses how satisfied franchisees were with
their decision to join and continue in the franchise system (Hunt and Nevin 1974; Lusch
1977). All the multi-item performance constructs were measured on a five-point Likert scale.
Opportunism is defined as the extent to which the franchisees act in self-interest
in order to achieve their own goals despite possible damage to their franchisors (Williamson 1975). Based on John (1984), an opportunism scale was developed to measure
the degree to which the franchisees believe they act in self interest in their dealings with
their franchisors.

Financial Capability
The franchisees’ financial capability was measured as the percentage of their initial investment dollars in the franchised business that came from personal savings. The variable is termed personal investment. Literature shows that franchisors preferred franchisees who were willing to invest substantial personal savings in the franchise.

Experience and Management Skills
Four distinct variables were used to capture the franchisees’ experience and management skills: prior experience, prior self-employment, owning other businesses, and managing operations. The prior experience variable was measured as the degree to which
the franchisee had previous experience with a business similar to the current franchised
business. Prior self-employment was a dichotomous variable that measured whether
the franchisee was self-employed prior to becoming a franchisee with the current business. The owning other businesses variable indicates the franchisees’ involvement in

<-----Page 16----->FRANCHISEE SELECTION CRITERIA

379

other businesses and operations. Finally, the managing operations variable was operationalized as whether the franchisee personally manages the day-to-day operations of
the franchised business.

Demographics
The variables include age, gender, education, ethnicity, and marital status. Age and education were measured in years. Gender is self-explanatory. Ethnicity was treated as a
dichotomous variable using the majority (white) and minority (non-white) categories.
Marital status is also a dichotomous variable with married and unmarried as the
two groups.

Attitudes Toward Business
Measure development was guided by conceptual definitions and prior research conducted by the authors. The multi-item scales for each dimension of ATB were developed
based on the procedures outlined by Churchill (1979). Appendix A contains a description of response formats and specific items for each scale.
The perceived innovativeness dimension was measured with items that asked about
franchisees perception and engagement in developing new ideas, products, and services
for the franchise system. The desire for personal development dimension was measured
as the influence of factors such as career advancement, new skill development, and expression of their ideas on the franchisee’s decision to purchase the franchise. The seek
work-related challenges dimension described the franchisees general attitude towards
work-related challenges. The personal commitment to business dimension tapped into
the level of commitment franchisee’s have to their franchised business. Finally, the business risk-taking dimension was measured as the franchisee’s feelings about business risk.
All the constructs were measured on a five-point Likert scale.

Control Variable
The length or age of a business may have a significant effect on the outcomes of franchisees due to potential life cycle or experience effects. We controlled for its effects in
this study.

Analysis Procedure
The analysis procedure involved four steps. First, the ATB dimensions and outcome
measures were purified, based on Cronbach a, item-to-total correlation, and factor analysis (Churchill 1979). Second, regression analyses were conducted with financial capability, experience and management skills, and demographic characteristics as independent variables and outcome measures as dependent variables. In the third step, similar
regression analyses were conducted with ATB dimensions as independent variables.
Steps 2 and 3 were conducted to provide addition tests for hypothesis 16. Finally, the
regression coefficients were re-estimated when the ATB dimensions were added to the
rest of the variables. This final model was used to test for all the hypotheses proposed
in the study (H1–H16). In all the regression models, age of business was used as a control
variable. This produced an evaluation of the relative influence of the financial capability,

experience and management skills, demographics, and control variables along with
ATB dimensions on franchisee outcomes (cooperation, opportunism of the franchisees,
and satisfaction with the business decision). This procedure was designed to show the
additional variance in franchisee outcomes attributable to the attitudes toward business dimensions.

RESULTS
Measures Validation Procedure
Prior to testing our substantive hypotheses, the measures were subjected to a series of
reliability and validity checks. First, the different multi-item scales were evaluated on
the basis of item-to-total correlation. The outcome measures consisted of one multidimensional, multi-item construct (i.e., cooperation) and two multi-item constructs (i.e.,
satisfaction with the business decision and opportunism). The reliabilities of the dimensions of cooperation: information exchange, flexibility and problem solving were 0.85,
0.84, and 0.82 respectively. The three factors are viewed as comprising a higher order
factor (cooperation). This corresponds to a second-order confirmatory factor model,
in which the observed items are hypothesized to originate from the three first-order
factors and the first-order factors in turn originate from a second-order factor. The LISREL estimates for the second order factor model, and the indices are shown in Table
4. The model as a whole has a satisfactory fit to the data (x2 (23) 5 44.67, p 5 0.001,
GFI 5 0.95, AGFI 5 0.91, RMSEA 5 0.043, BIC 5 271.18), and the relevant first and
the second-order factor loadings are large and significant. The model supports the conceptualization of cooperation as a second-order construct. Thus, the three dimensions
of cooperation were combined into a composite score for the hypotheses tests.
Two multi-item constructs were used as outcome measures. For the five-item satisfaction with the business decision construct, one item was dropped and the alpha for
the satisfaction with business decision was 0.91. Again the measurement model was sig-

RMSEA 5 0.019). The Cronbach a for opportunism of franchisees was 0.88. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a single construct. Confirmatory factor analysis showed
a good model fit (X2 (9) 5 7.28, p 5 0.2, GFI 5 0.99, AGFI 5 0.97, RMSEA 5 0.036).
For the different multi-item scales of the ATB dimensions, we eliminated one item
from the perceived innovativeness scale, one item from the seek work-related challenges scale, and two items from the business risk taking scale. These items had low
item-to-total correlations with the respective scales. Following the initial analysis, the
ATB item set was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis to establish unidimensionality. As suggested by Gerbing and Anderson (1988), we estimated a measurement model
in which every item was restricted to load on its hypothesized factor, and the underlying
factors were initially intercorrelated. The model was estimated by maximum likelihood
using the LISREL 8.14 program. Results are shown in Table 5. The overall chi-square
statistic for the model is significant (X2 5 180.06 (135), p , 0.001), but the BIC index
and the other fit indices (BIC 5 2499.93, GFI 5 0.93, and AGFI 5 0.91) represent
evidence of a good model fit. Each of the factor loadings is large and significant at the
0.01 level, and a series of X2 difference tests on the factor correlations suggest that the
different measures are distinct. Finally, as shown in Appendix A, the coefficient alphas,
except for the business risk-taking scale (0.58) and personal commitment (0.67) were
satisfactory. Because it is an important variable in the study, both business risk-taking
and personal commitment to business were retained.

Regression Analyses
The means and standard deviations of the scales used in the study are also shown in
Table 6. Before conducting the regression analyses, we checked for multi-collinearity
by examining the correlations of each of the independent variables in the regressions

with all the other independent variables (see Table 6). The maximum correlation coefficient among the independent variables was 0.29 for personal investment and age. None
of the correlations exceeded 0.54, indicating that collinearity among independent variables is not an issue. Thus, the addition of variables to the regression did not add redundant sources of explained variance. Multi-collinearity did not pose a problem, and,
therefore, regression analyses were conducted. The regression analysis results are
shown in Table 7. A summary of the proposed hypotheses and results from the study
are shown in Table 8. Each of the 15 independent variables have been hypothesized
to be related to three dependent variables: (a) labeled cooperation, (b) satisfaction with
the business decision, (c) and franchisee opportunism.

Testing Hypotheses
Cooperation
In the first model only the traditional factors (financial capability, experience and managerial factors, and demographic factors) were regressed on cooperation. Only prior selfemployment was significant and positively related to cooperation. The explained variance was only 0.1%. The traditional factors do not account for any of the variance in
franchisee cooperation.
In the second model, the dimensions of ATB were regressed on cooperation. Perceived innovativeness and personal commitment to the business were positively related
to cooperation. This indicates that those franchisees who have higher perceived innovativeness and personal commitment to the business view the relationship between them
and their franchisors as more cooperative. The explained variance of the second model
was 14%, which is a significant improvement over the first model.
In the third model both the traditional factors and the ATB dimensions were combined and regressed on cooperation. This model provided the test for H1a–H15a. In
this model, those who had prior experience in a similar business before becoming a
franchisee viewed their relationship with the franchisor as more cooperative (H2a).
In addition, perceived innovativeness (H11a) and personal commitment to business
(H14a) were significant in the third model. The prior employment variable that was
significant in model one dropped out. All other variables were insignificant in the third
model. The R 2 was 16.1% and the regression was significant at the p , 0.001 level. The
addition of the ATB factors to the traditional factors significantly increased the R 2 by
16% and thus significantly improve the explained variance in the model. This supports
H16 that ATB factors are more important in predicting cooperation compared to the
traditional factors. Age of business was not significant in all three of the models.

Satisfaction with the Business Decision
The first model showed that personal investment, owning other businesses, and gender
were significant and negatively related to the satisfaction with the business decision (Table 7). The negative coefficient for personal investment means that franchisees who invested a larger proportion from their own savings were less satisfied with their business
decisions which contradicts our predicted hypothesis (H1b). Similarly, those who owned
other businesses were less satisfied with the franchisor. Finally, contrary to H7b, men
were more satisfied with their business decision than women. This regression explains
9% of the variance.

When the ATB dimensions were regressed on satisfaction with the business decision, two independent variables were significant: perceived innovativeness and personal
commitment to the business. Age of business was also significant and positively related
to the dependent variable. All the significant variables were positively related to the
dependent variable (Table 7). The explained variance (R 2) for this model was 47.8%
and the regression was significant at the p , 0.001 level.
In the final model, the ATB dimensions were added to the predictors in the first
model. In the third model, including the ATB dimensions with the traditional factors
provided the test for H1b–H15b. This model yielded a substantial increase in R 2 over the
first model (9% vs. 52%). All the variables that were significant in the first two regression
models were significant in the third model, except the “owning other businesses” variable which dropped out. The directions of the relationships that were significant were
consistent across all the models except personal investment, where the direction of the
relationship was contradictory to the predicted hypothesis (H1b). The other hypotheses
that were supported were H8b, H11b, and H14b. The significant improvement in explained variance of the third model compared to first model supported H16. All other
variables were insignificant in the third model.

Franchisee Opportunism
In the third set of models, franchisees’ opportunism toward their franchisors was the
dependent variable. Among the traditional factors in the first model, age was negatively
related and gender was positively related to the dependent variable. This means that

<-----Page 24----->FRANCHISEE SELECTION CRITERIA

387

those franchisees who are older are less opportunistic toward the franchisor than those
who are younger, and men were found to be more opportunistic toward their franchisors
than women. The variance explained by the model was only 1.7%.
When ATB dimensions were regressed on franchisee opportunism in the second
model, perceived innovativeness, seeking work-related challenges, and personal commitment to the business were negatively related to franchisee opportunism, but business
risk taking was positively related to franchisee opportunism. Those who perceive themselves as risk takers tend to be more opportunistic with the franchisor compared to those
who do not. The R 2 for the model was 11.7%.
In model three, when the ATB dimensions were added to the traditional factors
and regressed on franchisee opportunism, all the variables that were significant in the
first two models remained significant in the third model. This model tested for hypotheses H1c–H15c. The hypotheses that were supported were H6c, H7c, H11c, H13c, H14c,
and H15c. The explained variance was 13.6% and the regression was significant at the
p , 0.001 level. Age of business did not have any significant impact on the dependent
variable in all the models.

DISCUSSION
Our study makes valuable contributions to the theory and practice of franchisee selection. This is the first study that relates widely advocated selection criteria used by
franchisors in the selection of potential franchisees to outcome measures that are desired by franchisors and suggested by agency theory. Furthermore, this study illustrates
the use of prudent selection criteria as an input control strategy. It is clear that choosing
and implementing relevant selection criteria is of paramount importance for the franchisor and the franchising system as a whole. This study shows that franchisee selection
criteria can explain a significant portion of the variance in franchisee outcomes. These
selection criteria explain a high of 52% of the variance for satisfaction with the business
decision to a low of 13.6% of the variance for franchisee opportunism. These results
substantiate our hypotheses that the selection criteria used in the study do explain significant variance in the dependent variables. In addition, these results indicate that
franchisors should be able to identify and select franchisees who are more likely to perceive the relationship with franchisors to be more cooperative, to be more satisfied with
their business decision, and to behave less opportunistically by using these or similar
selection criteria. Franchisees with desirable characteristics can lower the agency costs
to the franchisor in the form of less safeguarding and monitoring costs. Thus, controlling
the quality of the franchisees using appropriate selection criteria can improve the efficiency of the contractual relationship for the franchisor.
This study also shows that franchisees’ ATB is an important construct to be used
in the selection process. ATB dimensions explained more variance in the dependent
variables than traditional factors, and, therefore, our second hypothesis was substantiated. Of the five dimensions used in the analyses, perceived innovativeness and personal
commitment to the business were consistently significant across all the models while
desire for personal development was insignificant in all the models. Wattel (1968–69)
concluded in his article that franchisors have been looking for industrious, hard-working
individuals and neglecting the individuals with creativity and innovation. It is important
that franchisors should seriously consider franchisees with higher perceived innovativeness. Strutton et al (1995) showed that when franchisors encourage franchisees to

<-----Page 25----->388

T. JAMBULINGAM AND J.R. NEVIN

be innovative the franchisees tend to view the relationship as more cooperative. Most
franchisees are highly involved in the operations of their business and know about the
basics of their own business more than the franchisors do (Ralston 1989). In addition,
innovative franchisees can resolve their problems by creative means. Franchisors can
benefit from these franchisees.
Personal commitment to business is an extremely important variable that has a positive effect on the franchisee outcome variables. Franchisees who are dedicated to their
business view the relationship as more cooperative. From the franchisor’s perspective
his/her network of units as a system compete with other networks of franchised units.
When a franchisee views their franchise system as a cooperative group, then they will
be likely to add to the growth and performance of the entire franchise system.
It is an interesting result that those franchisees who seek challenges at work were
found to be less opportunistic with their franchisors. An interpretation would be that
franchisees who do not seek challenges at work can be opportunistic in their behavior
in order to seek benefits from the franchisor. Opportunistic behavior can be an easier
solution for the franchisees than taking up challenges at work.
Business risk-taking behavior was found to have no effect on cooperation and satisfaction with the business decision, but, interestingly, it has a significant positive effect
on franchisee opportunism. Franchisees who perceive themselves to be risk-takers
seems to be opportunistic also. We defined risk-takers as those who gamble in their
decisions without investing in more information seeking efforts. Franchisors should
make every effort to recruit only franchisees who take calculated risk and not gamblers.
We can also infer from the results that most of the traditional factors were found
to have little or no influence over the desired outcomes investigated in this study. In
the financial capability category, personal investment was negatively related to satisfaction with business decisions. This finding means that those franchisees who have invested a greater proportion from their personal savings are less satisfied with their business decision to invest in franchising. This could possibly occur because these
franchisees might have higher expectations from their business relationships with
the franchisor.
Prior experience had a significant positive effect on the extent of perceived cooperation in the relationship with the franchisor. It could be that franchisees who have prior
experience with a similar business know more about what it takes to run a business.
They may really appreciate the support provided by the franchisor and thus view the
relationship with the franchisor to be more cooperative. Other criteria such as prior
self-employment, owning other businesses, and personally managing day-to-day operations do not contribute to the perceived outcomes of the franchisees. This result is interesting because the franchising literature suggests that those who were self-employed
prior to becoming franchisees tend to be a better choice. It also fails to support the
conventional wisdom that franchisees who manage the day-to-day operations of the
franchise will have higher outcome levels.
In the demographics category, age, education, ethnicity, and marital status have
no effect on the outcomes. A debated issue in franchising is whether to select a more
educated or a less educated franchisee prospect. This study indicates that education is
not really related to the outcomes of franchisees. Age and gender have a significant
effect on franchisee’s opportunism. The interpretation is franchisees who are older are
less opportunistic than younger franchisees. Similarly, men are more opportunistic than
women. In addition, gender also has a significant positive effect on satisfaction with the
business decision. It seems that men are more satisfied than women. Franchisors should

<-----Page 26----->FRANCHISEE SELECTION CRITERIA

389

give consideration to the importance of the outcome variable and act accordingly in
their choice of the franchisees.
Finally, age of business, which is used as a control variable, has an interesting relationship with the outcome measures. Age of business has no impact on cooperation or
opportunism of the franchisees but has a positive effect on satisfaction with the business.
This finding illustrates that franchisees with older businesses are more satisfied with
their business. Even though the number of years in business has been restricted to three
years, there is some life cycle effect in the relationship between the franchisee and
the franchisor.

MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
This study shows the importance of using certain selection criteria as a key input control
strategy for franchisors. Controlling the input by selectively choosing individuals based
on a set of tested selection criteria can improve the short and long-term outcomes of
the franchisees and thereby reduce the agency costs. This study shows that a franchisee’s
attitudes toward business may serve as good indicators of franchisee outcomes. Specifically, selecting individuals who have a high score on perceived innovativeness, and a
high personal commitment to the business would likely enhance their outcomes in the
franchise system.
These empirical findings provide encouraging support for the use of selection criteria to screen prospective franchisees based on their likely outcomes. Franchisors who
either do not use formal screening criteria or use only the conventional selection criteria
can expect to improve their selection process through the use of prospective franchisees’
attitudes towards business. Franchisors would be wise to benchmark their existing franchisees on outcomes and identify critical selection criteria that lead to superior outcomes. Franchisors should then use those identified selection criteria in recruiting and
selecting new franchisees.
This study indicates that a franchisee’s attitudes toward business are more important in predicting desired outcomes than traditional selection factors typically used by
franchisors. A recent article on hiring the right employees to care for the customers,
claims that employers should screen prospective employees on their attitudes rather
than their skills (The Economist 1997). It seems that attitudes can seldom be taught,
but skills can be instilled after hiring the employee. Our findings support that attitudes
are very important and that an assessment of prospective franchisees should incorporate
appropriate attitude measures.
The methodology used in this study could be employed by the franchisors to evaluate their prospective franchisees. Franchisors can also validate the aggregate findings
in this study by using our measures to study their existing franchisees. In this way,
franchisors can tailor their selection criteria to their experiences within their own franchise system. The use of effective franchisee screening criteria should improve the success rate of new franchisees and lessen the long-term dependence on monitoring as a
means of controlling franchisee behavior.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
We caution readers that there are several constraints to the generalizability of these
results. First, we investigated the selection criteria using ongoing franchisees from five
of the larger franchise business categories. Thus, this sample frame obviously does not

<-----Page 27----->390

T. JAMBULINGAM AND J.R. NEVIN

include franchisees who were already out of business. There is therefore a bias in the
sample frame used in the study. It is also important to recognize that the measures developed were relevant also to prospective franchisees. Some might argue that there is an
experience effect that could influence the attitudes and performance of the franchisees.
We tried to remove the experience effect by limiting the study to only franchisees who
are in business three years or less and by also controlling for the experience effect statistically in the models by controlling for the age of business. In addition, ATB variables
were found to be extremely stable over the age of business. This does not negate the
fact that this study’s findings need to be validated using prospective franchisees in a
longitudinal study. The measures used in this study could be easily modified to evaluate
the prospective franchisees. But given the importance of the topic and the dearth of
studies linking the selection criteria and franchisee performance, this study is an important first step toward a fruitful goal. Second, even though the outcome measures were
all measured from the franchisee’s perspective, the outcomes have significant importance to the franchisors. Finally, the measures for personal commitment and risk had
relatively low reliability, with as of 0.67 and 0.58 respectively. Better measures may
affect the nature and the strength of these findings.
In this study, only a limited number of selection criteria were tested for a relationship with the franchisee outcome measures. Future studies should include other relevant
criteria that might be important in explaining franchisee outcomes. For example, ATB
dimensions are only one aspect of the attitudes/personality of an individual franchisee.
Other potential attitudinal and personality factors should be explored in an effort to
improve explanatory power. Questions remain as to how the prospective franchisee’s
entrepreneurial inclination and ability to win respect from others would influence franchisee performance.
We operationalized financial capability as the proportion of the initial investment
dollars which came from the franchisee’s own personal savings. Other possible sources
of investment are: credit or bank loans and funds from family and friends. These different types of investment may have different effects on the franchisee’s performance.
The results from this study show that franchisees with a higher score on risk taking
are more opportunistic with their franchisors. This topic deserves further exploration.
We operationalized risk taking behavior similar to gambling. Risk-taking can also be
defined as investing more in the business. Agency theory suggests the franchisees who
take more risk by investing more in the business can reduce the agency costs for the
franchisor (Brickley and Dark 1987). This operationalization of risk needs to be further explored.
Finally, male and female franchisees had different levels of opportunism toward
their franchisors and satisfaction with the business decision. The reason why this occurred is unclear. Do the different genders have different expectations for themselves,
or tolerance ranges for their franchisor’s behavior? These are some of the interesting
questions that can be investigated in future research.
