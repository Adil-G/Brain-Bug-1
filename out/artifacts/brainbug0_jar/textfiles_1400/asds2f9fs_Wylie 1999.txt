Thesis abstract
This thesis studies aspects of equity market outcomes that may arise from the
existence of fundamental differences in the optimisation problems of private
investors and institutional investors.
The first essay reviews what is known and unknown about the differences in the
incentives of private investors and fund managers, and examines the significance of
those differences for market outcomes.

The growth of delegated portfolio

management in the UK and the US is firstly documented. Then, the results of
empirical studies of incentives faced by fund managers, and resultant fund manager
trading behaviour, is surveyed. Next, the optimisation problems faced by private
investors and fund managers are contrasted. Finally, the essay presents conjectures
on the effect of differences in the incentives of private and institutional fund
managers on unexplained stock market phenomena.
In the second essay a dataset of the portfolio holdings of 268 UK equity mutual fund
managers is employed to test for herding among UK unit trust managers and at the
same time test the accuracy of the herding measures of Lakonishok, Shleifer and
Vishny (LSV 1992b) and Wermers (1995, 1999). Invalid assumptions in the LSV
and Wermers measures, which may be expected to bias the measures, are identified
and analysed.
A bootstrap re-sampling technique is developed to create replicated datasets which
exhibit approximately zero systematic herding but are drawn from populations in
which the invalid assumptions are relaxed. The results show that the LSV
assumption, that all managers short sell, biases the measure towards finding herding
in the smallest stocks, the largest stocks and stocks in which a small number of
managers trade during a period. Nonetheless, a significant amount of herding among
UK unit trust managers is found particularly in the smallest and largest market
capitalisation stocks. The Wermers measure is biased toward finding herding in all
subsets of the data which are formed on the basis of stock size or the number of
managers trading the stock during a period.

<-----Page 3----->4

The final essay models the relationship between a fund manager’s portfolio
performance figures and an investor’s decision, each period, to either retain or fire
the fund manager. The investor must decide on the basis of evolving information
whether to abandon the current manager, and at cost K, engage the best alternative
manager. The model highlights the value of the real option to delay the decision by
one or more periods, after which some uncertainty about the quality of the manager
is resolved. In addition, the model partially explains why some investors wait a
seemingly irrational length of time before changing manager and shows the effect of
uncertainty over manager skill on the value of that real option. A closed form
solution is presented for the case of an investor deciding n periods after hiring the
manager and 2 periods from the investment horizon. Then simulation results are
provided for the case of an investor deciding n periods after hiring and 10 periods
from the investment horizon.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1

Theme and purpose of the thesis

The past three decades have seen the rise of funds management to a central position
in UK and US financial markets. In the equity markets of both countries the assets
managed by institutional investors now amount to over one half of the value of the
market.1 The consequences of the large scale delegation of portfolio decision making
by private investors to their chosen institutional investors, are not well understood.
They may be substantial; private investors and institutional investors face profoundly
different optimisation problems and can therefore be expected to undertake different
trades even if their information sets and initial conditions are identical.
An example can illustrate the differences in the incentives (objective function) faced
by private investors and fund managers.

Suppose a private investor and an

institutional investor each hold 4 percent of their respective portfolios in a particular
stock which realises a return of 150 percent over the following period. For the
private investor the stock generates a 6 percent increase in end of period wealth, in
direct proportion to the initial weight of the stock in the portfolio. The effect of the
stock return on the fund manager’s end of period wealth is more complicated.
Among many differences, the two principal differences are, firstly, that end of period
wealth will be a non-linear function of the excess-to-benchmark return of the stock
rather than a linear function of total return. Empirical studies have revealed that even
though management fees generally increase linearly with the size of the fund, there is
a non-linear relationship between a fund’s excess-to-benchmark portfolio return and
the flow of new money to the fund. Secondly, the scale of a large fund can make the
manager’s end of period wealth (or investment management firm value) highly
sensitive to returns achieved.

1

The terms money manager, fund manager and institutional investor are used interchangeably in the

finance literature and that practice is continued here.

<-----Page 13----->14

The point of this example is that private investors and fund managers face
fundamentally different incentives and can therefore be expected to behave
differently. The incentives of fund managers are shaped by the way that private
investors choose fund managers. The effect of these differences on market outcomes
is not well understood. The research reported in this dissertation seeks to understand
aspects of how financial market outcomes are related to decisions that arise from the
relationship between investors and their fund managers.
The first essay assesses the significance of the rise of delegated portfolio
management. The astonishing growth of managed funds is firstly documented. The
state of knowledge of fund manager incentives is then reviewed and the importance
of differences between the incentives of private and institutional investors are
analysed in the context of several unexplained equity market phenomena.
To better comprehend the market equilibrium and to decide whether differences in
incentives are important, we need to know whether investors can be clustered into
groups (in particular, private investors and institutional investors) which are
delineated by their trading behaviour. Empirical measures of herding are important
because a test for herding by a group of investors constitutes a test of whether the
group’s trading behaviour marks it as separate from the rest of the market.2 The
second essay develops and implements bootstrap methodology for testing the
accuracy of herding measures.

The herding measures, suitably adjusted for

inaccuracies, are then used to test for the presence of herding among UK equity fund
managers.
The rise of institutional investment is the story of millions of individual investors
choosing between thousands of fund managers. But how investors make decisions
on hiring and firing fund managers has received surprisingly little attention in the
finance literature. The third essay models this decision process with the aim of
better understanding the down-side of fund managers’ incentive schedules and

2

Brown and Goetzmann (1997) form US mutual fund managers into ‘style’ groups by a method

which is analogous to k-means cluster analysis.

<-----Page 14----->15

explaining seemingly curious aspects of investor behaviour in hiring and firing
managers.

1.2 Financial markets and the rise of delegated portfolio
management
The initial studies of fund manager incentives focused on the principal-agent
problem faced by investors. The tools of agency theory were applied and developed
within the framework of delegated portfolio management. However, it was found
that the optimal contract design, as predicted by agency theory was not reflected in
actual contracts between private investors and institutional investors.3 The great
majority of contracts between investors and mutual fund or pension fund managers
are ‘boilerplates’ with no explicit performance related component.
Empirical studies of fund manager incentives followed which sought, among other
things, to characterise and parameterise the implicit incentives faced by fund
managers. There is now a body of work which in aggregate can help to define the
incentive structure faced by mutual funds. Chapter 2, the first essay, meets the need
for a paper that brings together the results of the empirical studies of fund manager
incentives studies. Further, it analyses the consequences for market outcomes of the
difference between the incentives of private investors and institutional investors.
The empirical studies of fund manager incentives can be formed into three
categories: fee structures in mutual and pension funds; the flow of funds to mutual
and pension funds; and strategic behaviour and hedging by fund managers. The
essay includes a detailed literature review which consolidates results from the several
strands of the literature and includes observations from the many discussions with
fund managers on this topic conducted in the course of the research that is presented
in this thesis.
The most significant element in shaping the incentives of a fund manager is the
manner in which portfolio performance modulates the volume of money managed by
3

Hedge funds, private banking services and limited partnerships are clear exceptions.

<-----Page 15----->16

an investment management firm. New funds flow disproportionately to managers
who have performed strongly in recent periods. Consequently, the capitalised value
of future fees is highly dependent upon performance relative to the fund manager’s
peers. The relationship between performance and funds flow is non-linear with some
curious aspects, such as, the seemingly high tolerance of some investors for poor
performance and the preference of investors for fund managers with shorter track
records. These particular phenomena are partially explained in the Hiring and Firing
essay of chapters 5 and 6.
After consolidating the evidence on the nature of fund manager incentives, it is
examined in the framework of the optimisation problems faced by private investors
and institutional investors. The equivalent components of the optimisation problems
faced by members of these two groups are compared; including, objective function
(in which the incentives are embedded), opportunity set, constraints, choice variables
and initial conditions. The comparison allows a critical assessment of the findings of
the empirical studies and clarification of the differences between the incentives of
private investors and institutional investors.
Having established what empirical studies in aggregate can say about the differences
in incentives, the thesis examines aspects of how a market in which institutional
investors have a substantial role should be expected to differ from a market
comprised principally of private investors. The discussion focuses on evaluation of
managers against the performance of their peers, which ensures that private investors
and institutional investors have fundamentally different perceptions of risk. In turn
they may have different dynamic hedging demands, different perceptions of
corporate governance and different perceptions of optimal risk management by firms.
Further, in aggregate, private investors and institutional investors may choose
significantly different portfolios, which implies net trade between the groups.
The paper concludes with conjectures about how several unexplained phenomena in
equity markets may be partially explained by the differences in the incentives of
private investors and institutional investors. These conjectures are intended to form a
blueprint for ongoing research in this area.

1.3

Herding

In the finance literature ‘herding’ is taken to mean a group of investors trading the
same assets in the same direction at the same time. That is, trading correlated across
members of the group, in excess of that which arises simply from artefacts of the
market such as a rights issue. Previous empirical studies of herding have sought to
determine whether herding by institutional investors moves asset prices away from
‘fundamental’ values. However, a separate motivation for studying herding is that
empirical findings of herding are evidence that the market can be clustered into
groups of investors which are delineated by their different trading behaviour. If
private investors and institutional investors face significantly different incentive
schedules and solve correspondingly different portfolio choice problems, then we
should expect that in their trading behaviour the members of each group will on
average be more akin to each other than to members of the other group. Empirical
tests of herding by fund managers represent a test of that conjecture.
The objectives of the second essay (chapters 3 and 4) are fourfold. Firstly, to
develop a methodology for testing the accuracy of metrics which are based on
portfolio holdings data. Currently, portfolio holdings based measures of: herding;
portfolio performance; and window dressing; are simply assumed to return a value of
zero in the absence of the phenomenon being measured.

The bootstrapping

methodology developed here allows an approximate calibration of such measures to
zero. Secondly, to apply the bootstrapping methodology to test the accuracy of
existing herding measures. Studies employing those measures have found significant
levels of herding by US pension fund and mutual fund managers. However, as
demonstrated in the essay there is reason to believe that the measures return positive
values even in the absence of herding. Thirdly, to apply the herding measures,
suitably adjusted for estimated bias, to data drawn from a country which has an
investment management industry comparable to that of the US; thereby, extending
the generality of empirical herding results.

Finally, to provide a mathematical

formulation of herding that encompasses each of the several theoretical explanations
of fund manager herding. Further, to show that all of the theories have the same
fundamental explanation – the optimisation problems of individual fund managers
are related – but each theory simply concentrates on a different aspect of the

<-----Page 17----->18

optimisation problem.

In meeting these four objectives the essay makes

methodological, empirical and conceptual contributions to the literature on the
empirical study of herding.
The methodology of the accuracy tests is designed to overcome an obvious problem
in testing the accuracy of a measure in which the input is the whole dataset; we do
not have a large number of datasets which were drawn independently from the same
group of managers over the same period. Instead, a large number of independent
datasets are created by conditional bootstrap re-sampling. The re-sampling technique
is designed to ensure that: each re-sampled dataset exhibits zero systematic herding;
the invalid assumption that is being tested does not hold but other assumptions do;
and essential dataset characteristics that are not associated with herding are
preserved.
Applying a herding measure to each of the bootstrapped datasets builds up an
estimate of the sampling distribution of the measure under the null conditions of zero
herding. The mean of that empirical sampling distribution gives an estimate of the
degree of mis-calibration (the bias in the absence of herding) of the measure. In turn,
the mis-calibration is an estimate of the bias at the actual level of herding. Once an
estimate of the bias in the measure at the actual level of herding is available, then the
level of herding in the actual dataset can be measured and adjusted for the estimated
inaccuracy of the measure.
The dataset is comprised of the portfolio holdings of 268 UK equity unit trusts over
the period January 1986 to December 1993. It was compiled by Johnson Fry Pension
Fund Consulting from the biannual reports of unit trust managers to investors.4
There is a survivorship issue in that only unit trusts that were ‘alive’ in December
1992 are included. On the basis of results of previous empirical herding studies
survivorship bias is not considered a significant problem. Two major advantages of
the dataset are, firstly, that it contains UK data which allows the first test of herding
among UK fund managers. Secondly, UK data is ideal for testing the effect of a

<-----Page 18----->19

short selling constraint because all UK unit trust managers are prohibited from
undertaking short sales.
The LSV measure is found to be biased toward a finding of herding as a result of its
dependence on the invalid LSV assumption that all managers short sell all stocks.
About one half of the herding found in stocks other than the very largest or very
smallest is explained by this bias. About one third of the herding found in the
smallest group of stocks, those outside the one thousand largest, is explained by the
bias induced by the short selling assumption.
The accuracy tests demonstrate significant problems with the Wermers (1995)
measure of herding. The likelihood of incorrect inference with the Wermers measure
is severe. In each subset of the data, formed on the basis of the market capitalisation
of stocks and the number of managers trading during the period, the estimated
probability of the measure returning a significant level of herding on a dataset where
no herding exists is 0.25 or more. When the unadjusted Wermers measure is applied
to the UK dataset, approximately one half of the level of herding found is accounted
for by the estimated bias of the measure.
The accuracy tests reported here are general rather than specific tests which have
three potential problems. Firstly, some herding may survive the re-sampling process
that is intended to replicate datasets drawn from managers which do not exhibit
systematic herding. Secondly, the replicated datasets may differ in some essential
characteristic from the actual dataset, so that the estimated sampling distributions are
not representative of the choices of the managers under conditions of no herding.
Finally, some error is introduced because the number of re-sampled datasets is finite.
As discussed in chapter 4, the accuracy tests are designed to mitigate these problems;
nonetheless, they must be born in mind when considering the results of the tests.
When the LSV and Wermers herding measures are suitably adjusted for their
estimated mis-calibration on the UK dataset, a significant degree of herding remains.
For example, where 20 managers trade a stock in a particular period the level of
herding is commensurate with an average of 14 of the managers buying or 12 of the

<-----Page 19----->20

managers selling the stock.5 The results from both the adjusted LSV and adjusted
Wermers measures reveal that herding is increasing in the size of the stock and the
number of managers trading; as predicted by herding theory. A large amount of
herding is found among stocks with the smallest market capitalisation and most of
that herding appears as herding in buying of stocks rather than herding in selling of
stocks.
The herding essay tests the accuracy of the existing measures of herding and seeks to
adjust them for demonstrated mis-calibration. Ideally, the essay would propose an
improved measure of herding. However, in the finance literature herding is not a
precisely defined concept; which is a problem that is addressed in the essay. Rather
than propose another measure that seeks to catch all forms of herding, future herding
research should identify predictions of the principal theoretical explanations of
herding, and separate and test them. The objective of those tests being to illuminate
the causes of the herding and separate the competing theoretical explanations of the
existence of herding.
Other herding research might test for a link between herding and serial correlation in
stock returns.

There is evidence in the empirical herding literature that fund

managers herding into stocks cause the price of the stocks to rise. It is conceivable
that a large increase in the price of a stock causes institutional investors to herd into
that stock, as a result of asymmetric dynamic hedging by fund managers. If a rise in
a stock price causes herding which in turn causes a rise in the stock price, then a
causal link between herding and stock price momentum will have been established.

1.4

Hiring and firing

The relationship between a fund manager’s portfolio performance and the flow of
funds to that manager, which is central to understanding fund manager incentives,
has been illuminated by recent empirical studies. Those studies take the macro
approach of modelling the effect of portfolio performance, and other variables, on
5

The asymmetry exists because there are more occurrences of manager buys than manager sells in the

dataset, as a result of the positive flow of funds to UK unit trusts during the dataset period.

<-----Page 20----->21

aggregate fund flows. In contrast, at a micro level the flow of funds to and from
managers is determined by the decisions of individual investors. Those individual
agent level decisions, on which new managers to hire and which existing managers
to retain, in aggregate determine the flow of funds in the investment management
industry.
It is surprising then that the finance literature is so silent on how investors rationally
decide which managers to hire or when to fire a poor performing manager. There is
an extensive principal-agent literature which analyses the nature of optimal contracts
between investors and fund managers. But those studies seek to design optimal
contracts rather than model the investor’s decision problem.
The third essay (chapters 5 and 6) models the fund manager hiring and firing
decisions of individual investors, with three primary objectives. Firstly, to model at
the decision-theoretic level the relationship between fund manager portfolio
performance and investor hiring and firing decisions. Such a model may provide a
deeper understanding of how investors rank fund managers and how that ranking is
related to the moments of fund managers’ portfolio performance distributions.
Secondly, to better understand the downside of the incentive schedule faced by fund
managers.

Empirical studies of mutual funds find that fund managers face

tournament-like incentive schedules where the new money goes to managers with
recent high performance but other managers may have relatively poor performance
and still retain the bulk of funds under management.

The retention of poor

performing managers seems to go beyond what can be explained by transaction cost
or tax realisation explanations.
The model of investor hiring and firing decisions proceeds from two basic precepts.
The first is that investors view each manager within a universe of managers as a
separate project. The period by period portfolio return that a manager achieves, in
excess of the benchmark return, is the payoff to the project of choosing that manager.
There is a fixed per pound cost of initially choosing any manager or changing
managers (projects). Investors are assumed to simply choose the manager with the
highest initial value and then change managers when the value of the best alternative
manager exceeds the value of the current manager by more than the cost of changing

<-----Page 21----->22

managers. Investment in the benchmark portfolio is a project which returns zero
excess return in every period.

Therefore, the benchmark is a natural reference

project with zero value and active management is only chosen if it is a positive net
present value project.
The second basic precept is that investors have initial information on the moments of
the excess return distribution of the managers, upon which they base the choice of
manager. As the portfolio returns of the chosen manager are revealed over time they
are combined with the prior information and the perceived value of the manager
(project) is updated. If performance is a significant factor in determining whether to
retain the manager, the investor’s decision is naturally a Bayesian decision problem.
Naturally, because it is hard to imagine how investors could rationally choose
between active portfolio managers without some initial information on excess return
moments.
The Bayesian decision model is developed in a gamma-normal framework. The
excess return distributions of managers are assumed to be normal with unknown
mean and precision. The investor has a gamma-normal prior distribution over the
unknown parameters of the normally distributed excess return. It is shown that the
value of each manager (project) is the solution of a dynamic programming problem.
The investor’s decision is then modelled in two periods. N periods after the initial
choice of the manager, the investor is two periods from the investment horizon. At
that point the investor must decide whether to retain the manager or alternatively
choose another manager at cost K, whilst realising that the same decision must be
made one period from the horizon. A closed form solution for the value of the
existing manager (project) is found. The value function is decomposed into four
parts that have clear and intuitive meaning. An important, separable component of
the value function is the option to decide whether to retain or change the manager
after the next period’s excess return information is received. The option to decide
whether to change managers (projects) next period, after some uncertainty over the
manager’s ability has been resolved, has positive value which is formulated in the
two period model.

<-----Page 22----->23

Several propositions are then presented which represent the contribution of the
model. It is shown that the value of the embedded real option to delay the decision
on changing managers partially explains why some investors hold on to poor
performing managers for so long. Next, the relation between the posterior precision
of the expected excess return and the option value is analysed. It is shown that this
relation partially explains the empirical observation that after controlling for size and
performance, more new money flows to managers with shorter investment records.
The model is then used to characterise the priors of investors who choose active
management over passive management. A further contribution of the essay is to
move discussion of the choice of fund managers beyond the notion that ‘100 quarters
of data are required to be 95 percent certain that a manager has positive excess
return.’ The model demonstrates that in hiring and firing decisions the degree of
certainty that a manager can ‘beat the index’ is determined endogenously. Finally, a
number of comparative statics results are presented.
A simulation study of the comparative static results from the two period model is
then presented for an investor who has a 10 period investment horizon. The real
option effects are shown to be of a magnitude that is significant economically.

1.5

Overview of the funds management industry

1.5.1 Delegation of portfolio management
Investors have many good reasons for delegating management of their investment
portfolios to professional portfolio managers. By pooling their funds, investors can
share the fixed costs of trading assets and administering their portfolios, and reduce
the marginal costs of transaction and administration by employing specialised labour
and capital.6 Moreover, certain financial assets are traded in units of such high value
6

Some investors may choose to delegate portfolio management because by pooling with other

investors they can share the cost of entering and exiting the market with those other investors. In
funds that have no explicit entry or exit costs, investors who seek to ‘time’ their entry and exit from
the market can unload some of their transaction costs onto the fund’s other investors who trade less
often.

<-----Page 23----->24

or require such trading expertise that ordinary investors are forced to pool funds and
delegate management if they wish to invest in those asset classes.

Real estate

investment trusts, bond funds and country funds are examples of both unit size and
requisite trading expertise.
Investors may also delegate management for reasons that are not closely related to
investment management. Financial service companies induce investors to delegate
their portfolio management by bundling that service with other financial products,
such as insurance, chequeing facilities, cash withdrawal or other consumer
transaction services. In addition, the tax code in both the US and the UK confers tax
advantages on investment in certain qualifying funds.7 In both countries the accrued
pension fund assets of many employees are placed with pension fund managers as a
matter of course.
Investors may also choose to delegate portfolio management because they believe
that their chosen manager has private information which will generate a superior
portfolio return. There are a multitude of studies of the investment performance of
fund managers. Whilst the results are somewhat mixed, the preponderance of studies
conclude that portfolios managed by institutional investors do not earn higher risk
adjusted returns, after expenses, than benchmark portfolios that replicate the return
of the market portfolio. Unfortunately, we are still unsure whether fund managers
‘add value’ because none of these studies has comprehensively demonstrated that
their performance measure returns zero in the absence of fund manager trading based
upon private information.
However, in terms of returns relative to the market portfolio, performance
measurement is a zero sum game and some aggregate conclusions can be drawn from
the simple arithmetic of the market.8 Say that institutional investors as a group
outperform the market portfolio after adjustment for risk and expenses.

7

<-----Page 24----->25

return to the group of non-institutional (private) investors must fall short of the
market portfolio return by: the amount of the fund manager out-performance; plus all
trading execution costs of active managers and private investors; plus the expenses of
all the actively managed portfolios. The higher the proportion of the market’s value
which is managed by active managers, the more profound is this effect.
This simple idea helps to explain why some investors choose to pay the higher fees
of active management in markets where low fee, market replicating funds are
available. Investors who choose active portfolio management over passive portfolio
management must believe at least one of three things.

Either, that the market

exhibits semi–strong informational inefficiency and the average fund manager outperforms the market portfolio after risk and expense adjustment.9 Or, that the market
exhibits strong informational inefficiency where only some managers can form
private information sets and the investor can at least partially identify that subset of
managers. Or, that there is a dynamic interaction between private investors and
institutional investors; such as, provision of dynamic insurance between the groups,
which supports an efficient market equilibrium in which the two groups have
different average risk adjusted returns.
For many asset classes, the choice of active over passive management does not arise
because there are no passively managed portfolios that track the market return.
Moreover, for many investors the principal service of investment managers is the
informed allocation of funds to different asset classes which is by definition an active
exercise. Nonetheless, it remains a mystery why more money is delegated to active
rather than passive management in the UK and US equity markets.

1.5.2 Investment vehicles and investment products
The different types of investment vehicles available to investors reflect the different
purposes of those investments. Unit trusts and their US analogue mutual funds are
designed to pool the capital of small investors, such as households and small self
administered pension funds. Unit trusts and mutual funds are also known as openended funds because the managers of the fund, with the agreement of the Trustees,

<-----Page 25----->26

can issue new units and redeem units to meet the demand of investors. In this way
cash flows into and out of mutual funds but the change in the price of units simply
reflects the change in market value of the underlying assets. The market value of the
trust’s assets, divided by the number of units on issue, plus brokerage costs, gives the
price at which units can be redeemed. The price at which units can be purchased is
the redemption price, plus stamp duty, plus the entry fee. In contrast, closed-end
trusts, also known as investment trusts, are listed on stock exchanges and the shares
are traded as with ordinary stocks.
Many investors work for companies that offer or mandate an employee pension plan.
The defining characteristic of corporate pension plans is whether the plan defines a
benefit that is a percentage of final salary, to be paid to the employee on an ongoing
basis upon retirement; or alternatively, defines a contribution that is a percentage of
the employee’s current salary and is paid into the employee’s retirement savings
account.

Management of large defined benefit funds are typically delegated to

institutional investors who manage the fund as a separate (segregated) portfolio. The
fund may be divided among several institutional investors who specialise in different
investment approaches or asset classes.
money for multiple corporate clients.

Institutional investors manage pension
Smaller defined benefit plans generally

delegate the management of their pension assets to managers who pool the plan with
other small plans to achieve the administrative savings discussed previously. The
pooled fund will typically invest in unit trusts offered by the same investment
management firms.
Companies offering or mandating defined contribution pension plans usually invite a
small number of investment management firms to offer their unit trusts to the
employees as the pension investment vehicle.

The firm then pays the defined

contribution into the unit trusts chosen by the employee. In the US this type of
pension investing, in 401(k) plans, is partially responsible for the massive expansion
of the volume of money invested in mutual funds.

In the UK and US many

individuals who are not part of corporate pension plans have private pension plans
which again are usually invested in unit trusts and receive special tax treatment.

<-----Page 26----->27

This thesis is concerned with the decisions of investors and fund managers. Unless
otherwise specified investors refers to private individuals, who are saving for future
consumption, and corporations which are providing pension plans for employees.
Unless otherwise specified, fund manager or institutional investor or investment
management firm refers to the principal to whom private individuals and
corporations delegate their savings and pension assets respectively.

There are,

nonetheless, a number of other organisations in which portfolios are managed.
Insurance firms have very large portfolios of financial assets and managing those
portfolios professionally is one of the core competencies of insurance firms.
However, households and corporations do not usually choose between insurance
products on the basis of portfolio performance – if they do it is because of bundling
of insurance and investment products.10 Consequently, the management of portfolios
in insurance firms does not generate the decisions that are the focus of this thesis.
Hedge funds provide specialist and highly active management of funds, which is
essentially a private service to wealthy individuals. They are usually very active in
terms of volume of assets traded and may take highly leveraged, high risk positions
to maximise the return to private information or arbitrage opportunities identified by
the hedge fund manager. Unlike unit trust or pension fund managers, the contracts of
hedge fund managers’ with investors contain explicit performance related
components. Master limited partnerships are US based investment vehicles which
confer preferential tax treatment on up to 499 partners in a portfolio. The General
Partner is essentially the manager of the assets and receives incentive based fees for
that service. Master limited partnerships mostly invest in high risk portfolios of
private equity, such as, leverage buy out stakes and venture capital positions. Whilst
of interest in terms of manager incentives and investor decisions, hedge funds and
master limited partnerships operate essentially in a private market and are not a large
part of overall delegated portfolio management.
There are now a huge number of fund managers vying for the funds of investors.
Between 1985 and 1995 the number of US mutual fund investment management
firms increased from 252 to 558 and the number of funds increased from 1528 to

The portfolio performance of insurance fund managers is not readily available to households.

<-----Page 27----->28

5761.11 That compares to 2907 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) at the end of 1996.12 Corporate pension plan trustees also face a large field
of institutional investors eager to manage their money.
From an investor’s perspective fund managers are differentiated by several
characteristics. Firstly, the asset class in which the manager invests. Investors can
choose unit trusts or pension managers that invest in equities, bonds, real estate or
commodities in most every major market or region of the world. Within these asset
classes fund managers are further differentiated by the investment style of their
portfolio. These styles are numerous, loosely defined and overlap considerably.
They include growth, aggressive growth, value, general, high market capitalisation,
small market capitalisation, contrarian, recovery, special situations and many others.
Funds are also classified by their investment objective which may include the degree
of income versus capital growth that is sought, or the balance between equities,
bonds and other asset classes. Other funds are simply defined by the industry sector
in which they invest, such as, high tech or health care.
The terms investor and fund manager do not nearly describe all the roles fulfilled
within the unit trust and pension fund industries. The diversity of roles and the depth
of agency within the investment industry is best illustrated by example. Take, for
instance, the decision path in a defined benefit pension fund. The company makes
monthly contributions to fund the corporate pension plan. The trustee board is
required to represent the interests of the beneficiaries of the fund, who are current
and previous employees of the firm.

The trustee board chooses an investment

management firm to manage the pension fund. Therefore, the trustee board is the
agent of the beneficiaries and the principal of the investment management firm.
Within the investment management firm an employee is assigned the role of
portfolio manager. So the investment management firm is the agent of the trustee
board and principal of the employee fund manager. Of course, the portfolio manager
then chooses financial assets, which are issued by companies and institutions which
themselves have management who ultimately choose real projects in which to invest

<-----Page 28----->29

the pension money. Between the trustee board and the investment management firm
stand consultants who advise trustee boards on the choice of investment management
firms. Further, the portfolio return is independently measured and reported by a
performance measurement agency.
These relationships are mirrored in the unit trust industry. Many investors employ
independent financial advisors to assist with, among other things, the choice of unit
trust. The chosen investment management firm determines which of its employees
manages that trust. Independent measurement agencies report the performance of the
unit trust. The investment management industry is characterised by a series of
choices: investors choosing investment management firms, who choose portfolio
managers, who choose financial assets. In this context it is natural to study the
industry in terms of decisions and incentives.

1.5.3 How portfolios are managed
Active portfolio managers can add value in three ways: by asset allocation; market
timing; or stock selection. Asset allocation is a decision that no investor can avoid.
However, many investors delegate this decision to a fund manager, as is the case
with many UK pension funds or investors that choose ‘balanced’ unit trusts. Or the
investor makes an allocation of funds between asset classes and then chooses one or
more specialist managers in each class, as do many US pension plans. Within an
investment class an investment manager can add value by timing the market. This
involves holding less cash and increasing the portfolio’s exposure to market risk
when the manager believes the market return in the next period will be above its long
run average, and the converse when the market return is expected to be historically
low. Market timers are concerned with factors that affect the market as a whole.
Stock selectors, in contrast, seek to identify individual assets or sectors of the market
that will exhibit returns in the next period that exceed the return commensurate with

<-----Page 29----->30

their exposure to priced risk factors.13 In this case the manager is searching for
information that is idiosyncratic to the stock or sector.
An optimal asset allocation is an investor specific exercise. It depends upon, firstly,
the relationship between the investor’s expected utility of wealth (or firm value) and
the moments of the portfolio return distribution. Secondly, upon the investor’s time
discount rate and the loss function associated with being unable to meet anticipated
consumption requirements (or firm liabilities) in the future. Asset allocation is
essentially the solution of an investor specific dynamic optimal control problem.
Market timing is also an essentially quantitative problem. The manager must model
a relation between measurable economic variables and the market return, to obtain an
expected market return for the next period which is conditioned on those variables.
Stock selection can also be purely quantitative. Managers taking this approach must
have (or give the impression of having) either new quantitative techniques or a
proprietary dataset in order to delineate themselves from other managers and sustain
a competitive advantage.

However, most stock selecting managers undertake

‘fundamental’ analysis to arrive at estimates of the future returns on individual
stocks. The inputs to this analysis are publicly available information and semiprivate information derived from private briefings, company visits and the like.
Another conceivable approach to asset management is to ignore information on
specific assets or economic variables and instead act strategically in the asset
management ‘game’ by trading only on the basis of an understanding of the position
and behaviour of other institutional and private investors. However, this approach is
not common.
The 1996 Fund Management Survey of the UK Institutional Fund Managers
Association, reports that 77 of its 79 members managed a total of over £1,500

13

Managers are also looking for stocks that will under-perform. But managers can only directly

benefit from that information if they already hold the stock or the fund’s trust deed allows them to

<-----Page 30----->31

billion.14 These funds are heavily concentrated in the largest investment management
firms: the top quartile manages 66 percent of the funds and the bottom quartile
manages 4 percent. The investment management firms manage £423 billion on
behalf of UK corporate pension clients and £103 billion in unit trust funds. The
ownership structure of the investment management firms is quite diverse. Most of
the largest investment management firms are the investment management arms of
other financial services companies such as investment banks, commercial banks and
insurance companies. Others are separately listed or privately owned companies.
Investment management firms are the employers of portfolio managers. On average
the investment management firms of the IFMA survey employed 62 investment staff;
a category which includes analysts, portfolio managers and trading desk staff. The
investment management firms managed an average of 48 separate pension fund
portfolios and 18 unit trust portfolios each. Pension fund portfolios averaged £114
million and unit trust portfolios £50 million.

1.5.4 A comparison of the UK and US investment management industries
The investment management industries in the two countries are similar in most
respects, so it is easier to describe their differences. Both the UK and the US have
large corporate pension fund sectors.

In both countries there is a trend for

corporations to wind up their defined benefit plans, or more commonly close them to
new members, in favour of defined contribution plans. This trend is more advanced
in the US where nearly one half of pension funds by investment volume are in
defined contribution plans. UK pension funds are more heavily invested in equities
and have a greater proportion of the fund invested in foreign assets.
In the US, the accrued pension benefits of beneficiaries are guaranteed up to a limit
set by a Federal Government agency called the Pension Benefits Guarantee
Corporation (PBGC). There is no analogue to the PBGC in the UK. This may

14

(Wylie 1996b) The author advised on the construction of the survey, compiled and analysed the

data and wrote the report in its entirety. The IFMA survey was sent to the 79 members of the IFMA
which constituted the largest investment management firms based in London in March 1996.

<-----Page 31----->32

partially explain the profound asset allocation herding of UK pension funds.15 US
pension funds are highly varied in their asset allocation. Another stark difference in
pension fund management in the two countries is that many UK trustee boards
choose a single investment management firm which makes asset allocation decisions
within constraints and manages the fund as a single portfolio. US corporations, in
contrast, almost always make their own asset allocation choices and then choose one
or more managers for each asset class and perhaps even one manager for each
desired investment style within an asset class. US pension fund management is
correspondingly more specialised and management is less concentrated than in the
UK where five investment management firms manage over one half of all pension
fund assets.
The most striking difference between the unit trust industry in the UK and the mutual
fund industry in the US is scale. In 1996, US mutual funds managed $1,346 billion
of equities listed on the NYSE, whereas UK unit trusts in total managed less than one
eighth of that figure. The difference is partially explained by the larger role of
defined contribution plans in the US which use mutual funds as their investment
vehicles. Another striking difference is the near absence of actively managed UK
unit trusts that charge no entry fee or exit fee. In the US approximately one half of
all domestic equity funds are no load. Whereas few UK domestic equity unit trusts
charge an entry fee of less than 4 percent. Finally, index funds – funds that replicate
market portfolio weights or track the market return – form a larger proportion by
volume of US managed funds.

15

The WM Company’s 1995 study of asset allocation herding found that among UK pension plans

managed as single balanced portfolios, the interquartile range of portfolio weights allocated to UK
equities was only 4 percent. This herding is not just a curiosity. Defined benefit pension fund assets
amount to over one half of UK GDP. Asset allocation herding may serve the interests of: investment
managers, through mitigation of the risk of comparative performance evaluation; company security
holders, through reduced risks that a company will face contribution increases which competitors do
not face; and beneficiaries because if many funds become insolvent simultaneously the UK
Government may be forced to act in the beneficiaries’ favour

which represents an implicit

guarantee. However, from the point of view of the nation, asset allocation herding looks rather like
putting too many eggs in one basket.

<-----Page 32----->33

1.6

Market efficiency assumptions

As discussed previously, the choice of active management by some investors appears
to indicate that those investors believe that the market is sufficiently inefficient that
fund managers can earn risk adjusted returns that exceed the management fees and
expenses. Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) formulate the intuitive notion that as a
market approaches efficiency, the magnitude of the force moving it toward efficiency
approaches zero. Hence a perfectly efficient market even in the weak form is never
attained. Fama (1991) argues that the interesting question is not whether the market
is perfectly efficient but rather how close to efficiency it is. However, none of the
research presented in this thesis is directed toward determining the degree of
efficiency of financial markets.
In the following chapters it is nowhere assumed that financial markets deviate
substantially from efficiency. At several points it is argued or assumed that the
actions of some agents are consistent with those agents believing that the equity
market is substantially inefficient. It is reasonable when studying outcomes in the
market to make assumptions about the beliefs of agents that are consistent with their
behaviour even if there is no objective reason to believe that those beliefs are correct.
This approach is consistent with the view of optimal contracting taken here. The
thesis is not concerned with the question of whether investors are acting suboptimally, by ignoring the recommendations of the optimal contracting literature and
entering into contracts which have no explicit performance related components. It is
simply taken as an empirical fact that pension fund and unit trust contracts do not
typically contain these provisions and no further consideration is given to the matter
because it is not the focus of the research. Likewise, the thesis attempts to explain
decisions of investors and fund managers, in optimisation frameworks in which their
beliefs about market efficiency are taken as given.

1.7

The remainder of the thesis

The remainder of the thesis is set out as follows.

<-----Page 33----->34

Chapter 2 contains the first essay on financial markets and the rise of delegated
portfolio management.

This chapter: documents the rise of delegated portfolio

management in the UK and US; reviews the empirical literature on fund manager
incentives; contrasts the optimisation problems faced by private and institutional
investors; and presents conjectures on the relationship between differences in private
investor and institutional investor incentives and unexplained equity market
phenomena.
Chapter 3 contains the first part of the second essay which studies the accuracy of
measures of herding.

The theoretical and empirical herding literature is first

reviewed. Then the nature of herding theories and herding measures is analysed.
Chapter 4 presents the dataset employed in the study of herding and discusses the
strengths and weaknesses of the data. The methodology of the accuracy tests is
discussed. The herding measures are applied to a UK portfolio holdings dataset.
Finally, the results of the accuracy tests are presented and discussed at length.
Chapter 5 contains the first part of the third essay which studies the hiring and firing
of pension fund managers. To begin, a detailed discussion of the UK pension fund
industry is presented.
Chapter 6 presents the model of investors hiring and firing decisions. The model is
developed as a dynamic programming problem.

Then a two period model is

developed and a closed form solution attained. Propositions which summarise the
significant results of the model are presented. Finally, results of a simulation study
of the comparative statics results are presented for an investor who has an investment
horizon of 10 years.
Chapter 7 summarises the contribution and meaning of the thesis. It concludes with
a discussion of studies that follow from the research presented here.

In several branches of finance it is assumed that investors can be differentiated in
some fundamental way. For example, many models assume that there are informed
and uninformed traders in the market. Other studies assume that investors differ by
their investment horizons, tax status, location, trading costs, risk preferences or
endowments. It is accepted that the portfolio choices of investors, and hence the
dynamic market equilibrium, reflect this diversity.
However, there are few studies of the market equilibrium which recognise that two
investors can hold the same stock, in the same weight in their respective portfolios,
and yet face radically different relationships between price changes in the stock and
their end of period wealth.16 Nonetheless, there is now a body of empirical studies
which, in totality, demonstrate that the portfolio pay-offs to private investors and
institutional investors differ in this way.

Cohen (1998) directly addresses the

question of differences in the incentives faced by private and institutional investors.
He uses the US Federal Reserve Federal Flow of Funds data to examine the
aggregate holdings of US equities by private investors and institutional investors and
how they relate through time. The main finding is that institutional investors reduce
their holdings of US equities and private investors correspondingly increase their
holdings after rises in the market.
The difference in the incentives of private and institutional investors might have little
impact on market outcomes if not for two facts. Firstly, because they face different
state contingent pay-offs, private and institutional investors can be expected, all other
things equal, to choose different portfolios and have different hedging demands.
Consequently, every time a private investor delegates the management of a portfolio
to an institutional investor the market equilibrium is altered.

<-----Page 35----->36

Secondly, neither group has an insignificant role in the market. Since the mid 1960s,
financial markets in the UK and US have witnessed a massive transit of the control
of portfolios of financial assets from households to investment management firms.
The purpose of this essay is to argue that the transfer of the control of portfolios of
equities represents a significant structural change in the markets for those securities
because of the fundamental differences in the incentives faced by private investors
and institutional investors.

Moreover, this diversity in the incentives faced by

portfolio decision makers may be the key to understanding certain aspects of the
dynamic market equilibrium.
The tables and figures at the end of this chapter illustrate the rise of delegated
management of equity portfolios in the UK and US. The purpose is to collate data
that documents the transition of control of equities in the UK and US; then to review
what is known about the differences in incentives faced by institutional and private
investors and then discuss why those differences should be expected to impact equity
market equilibrium. The data does not explain why so many households have chosen
to delegate management of all or part of their investment in equities. Nor does the
data show whether the forces driving this transfer are the same in the UK and the US.
Those questions are obviously of interest in their own right but are not central to the
questions of this chapter.
In this context, a prime motivation for studying the history of the transfer of control
of equities, even without studying the cause of that transfer, is to do with the effect of
the rise of delegated portfolio management on long term studies of the equity market
equilibrium. If the level of ownership of equities by institutional investors versus
private investors significantly affects the market equilibrium, then tests of equity
market equilibrium phenomena that do not account for the changing level of
ownership may be mis-specified.

Brennan (1993) addresses the differences in the incentives faced by fund managers and private

investors in a general equilibrium framework similar to that of the CAPM.

2.2

The rise of delegated portfolio management

In this section a series of tables and charts illustrate the rise of delegated portfolio
management to a prominent position in the financial markets of the US and UK. For
ease of exposition, all tables and figures referred to in the text are presented at the
end of this chapter.

2.2.1 The UK experience
Table 2.1 and figure 2.3 show the level of UK financial assets held by various types
of financial intermediaries in the UK economy. Those intermediaries can be grouped
into three principal sectors. Investment management encompasses pension funds,
unit trusts and insurance companies. The banking sector comprehends UK banks
and building societies. Other sectors are the household sector and the foreign sector.
Since 1967 the assets of financial intermediaries in the UK have expanded a great
deal. Table 2.2 and the corresponding figure 2.4 show the level of financial assets of
UK financial sectors since 1967 as percentages of UK GDP.

The investment

management sector has grown from 47 percent of GDP in 1967 to 202 percent at the
end of 1997.

The annualised geometric mean growth rate of the investment

management sector in the period 1969 to 1997 was 15.7 percent versus 10.6 percent
for nominal GDP.
Assets in the banking sector have grown at a marginally faster rate than those in the
investment management sector. They grew from 64 percent of GDP at the end of
1967 to 264 percent in 1997 at an annualised rate of 15.8 percent. The assets of the
banking sector include non-sterling denominated assets, and likewise for bank sector
liabilities. These figures record the growth of London as a centre for international
banking in the period.
The total market capitalisation of listed UK equities grew at 15.4 percent per annum
in the period 1967 to 1997. Table 2.3 shows the level of UK equity holdings in the
investment management, foreign and household sectors in the period 1967 to 1997.
The equity holdings of the investment management sector grew at 17.6 percent per

<-----Page 37----->38

annum versus a growth rate of only 11.8 percent for the UK equity holdings of the
UK household sector in the period December 1975 to December 1997.
Table 2.4 shows that if the UK equity holdings of the investment management,
foreign and household sectors are summed, then the proportion of that sum held by
the household sector fell from 49 percent at the end of 1979 to 20 percent in 1997.
The corresponding figures for the investment management sector are a rise from 41
to 57 percent.17 The proportion of equities in pension funds rose from 23 to 27
percent from 1979 to 1997. The corresponding figures for unit trusts are 4 percent to
7 percent, and for insurance companies (long term funds) the rise is from 14 percent
to 23 percent. Figure 2.5 illustrates the changing proportions of UK equities held by
the components of the investment management sector and the foreign and household
sectors.18
Table 2.5 and figure 2.6 show the UK equity holdings of UK financial sectors as a
percentage of their total financial assets. UK pension funds have not much changed
17

Ideally the changes in the relative equity holdings of institutional versus private investors would be

illustrated in terms of the percentage of the market capitalisation of the UK equity market held by
each group over time, as is done when describing the rise of delegated portfolio management in the
US in the next section. However, because of double counting in the Office for National Statistics
equity levels series, the sum of equity holdings of the investment management, foreign and household
sectors exceeds the total market capitalisation of UK listed equities in several years between 1967 and
1997. There is no straight forward way of undoing the double counting.
18

The investment management sector as defined here includes insurance companies. As shown in

table 2.3 insurance companies, long term funds in particular, in aggregate hold a large portion of the
UK equity market.

Equity portfolio management is a core competency for many insurance

companies. Insurance companies are included in the investment management sector because a large
part of the equities managed by insurance companies are part of the assets of pooled pension schemes
managed by insurance companies or personal pension products. Other equity portfolios of insurance
companies principally support the savings function of products that bundle savings and insurance
services. The pension and savings related equity portfolios of insurance companies are substitutes for
portfolio management that households could otherwise undertake on their own behalf without any
delegation of portfolio management, which is the central interest of this section. However, it should
be noted that a part of the equity holdings of insurance companies relates to risk sharing rather than
savings and those equity holdings do not represent portfolios that individual households could manage
on their own behalf.

<-----Page 38----->39

the allocation of their assets to UK equities over the period of interest. In 1968 their
allocation was 52 percent and at year end 1997 it was 52 percent. The increase in the
proportion of equities held by pension funds reflects their increase in total assets
managed rather than asset allocation change. In contrast insurance companies have
increased the percentage of their assets held in UK equities from 17 percent in 1967
to 42 percent in 1997. The increased allocation of insurance companies is consistent
with their increased role as managers of pooled pension funds and products for
personal pensions.
Table 2.6 shows the net acquisition of UK equity holdings of UK financial sectors on
an annual basis from 1966 to 1997. Figure 2.7 presents the annual net flow of
equities, averaged over eight year periods, to UK financial sectors as a percentage of
the total year end market capitalisation of listed UK equities. Households have been
net sellers of equities in all but three years in the period 1966 to 1997. Figure 2.7
highlights the massive flow of equities to pension funds from the mid 1960s through
to the late 1980s. In the periods 1966-73, 1974-81 and 1982-89 the annual net
purchases of UK equities by pension funds as a percentage of end of year total UK
equity market value was 1.5 percent, 3.1 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. The
flow equities to insurance companies has been on a smaller scale but more consistent
in time, averaging between 0.9 and 1.0 percent of total market value per annum over
the periods 1974-81, 1982-89 and 1990-1997.
Flows to unit trusts have been consistent and positive in each period but at a lower
level than pension funds and insurance companies. Nonetheless, unit trust holdings
have grown at 17.3 percent per annum from a low base. Table 2.7 records the
number of unit trust holdings of households, pension funds and other investors. The
number of holdings increased by 80 percent from 5 million to 9 million in the four
years from year end 1993.

2.2.2 The US experience
Table 2.8, and its corresponding figure 2.8, show the financial asset levels of the
various US financial sectors at year end in the period 1967 to end of year 1998.
These sectors are a subset of the financial sectors defined in the US Federal
Reserve’s Flow of Funds publication. They are the sectors which hold a large

<-----Page 39----->40

volume of financial assets; other than, households, non-profit organisations, and
federal government agencies. For the purpose of this section the sectors can be
grouped as follows. Pension funds of both public and private organisations, plus
mutual funds and money market funds, plus bank personal trusts and estates make up
the investment management sector. Commercial banks and the savings institutions
combined constitute the bank sector. The insurance and foreign sectors remain
separate sectors. Figure 2.9 depicts the level of financial assets of the different
sectors in nominal terms.
There is a degree of double counting in tables 2.8 and 2.9. At the end of 1998,
private pension funds held $564 billion in mutual fund shares, $58 billion in money
market funds and $31 billion in deposits with the bank sector. Insurance companies
held $31 billion in mutual fund shares and $112 billion in money market fund shares.
For simplicity this double counting is only considered in what follows where its
effect is material to the discussion.
Between December 1969 and December 1998 the total financial assets in the sectors
reported in table 2.8 grew at a geometric average rate of 11.0 percent per annum. In
the same period nominal US GDP grew at 7.7 percent per annum. The 11.0 percent
growth rate of financial sector assets is not simply the result of high asset returns in
this period. To see this consider the following factors. The percentage growth figure
is derived from holdings of assets with high and low historical returns and periods of
high returns to financial assets and periods of low returns. Moreover, a 31 year
period must be a significant portion of the investment horizon of many investors,
meaning that funds flow out to meet the savings objectives of investors as well as
flowing in.19
The growth of total assets masks the disparity in growth of the different financial
sectors. The growth rates of the investment management sector and foreign sector, at

19

Poterba (1998) looks at the question of whether de-cumulation of financial assets by ‘baby
they grow older and leave the workforce will lead to a reduction in asset returns. He

finds little support for large scale de-cumulation in the foreseeable future.

<-----Page 40----->41

13.3 and 15.0 percent respectively in the period 1969 to 1998, are much higher than
those of the bank sector and insurance sectors at 8.2 percent and 9.9 percent.
The structural change in financial intermediation that has occurred in the US is also
apparent in figure 2.9. In 1969 the combined financial assets of private pension
funds, state and local government pension funds, mutual funds, money market funds
and bank personal trusts and estates, amounted to only 35 percent of the GDP of the
US.20 By the end of 1998 that figure was 152 percent of GDP.21 In contrast, the
combined financial assets of commercial banks, savings and loans institutions,
mutual savings banks and credit unions increased only modestly as a percentage of
GDP, going from 73 percent in 1967 to 83 percent at the end of 1998. In 1969, the
market value of financial assets held by the US investment management sector was
less than one half that of the bank sector.

At the end of 1998, assets under

investment management exceeded bank sectors assets by 82 percent. This change in
the ratio of value of assets controlled by investment managers versus banks
represents a fundamental change in the flow of savings to productive projects and the
governance and oversight of capital in the US economy.
From nominal growth rates it is difficult to assess the real magnitude of the growth of
assets under institutional management. Table 2.9 shows the level of assets in the
Federal Reserve defined sectors as a percentage of US gross domestic product
(GDP). Figure 2.9 is a comparative depiction of the same data. It is clear from this
figure that delegated portfolio management in the US (the bottom five series in figure
2.9) has grown rapidly as a proportion of GDP only since the early 1980s, and that
growth has continued through 1998.

20

The growth in assets under management

1969 is the beginning date for this comparison because that is the year in which Federal Flow of

Funds reports the assets of bank personal trusts and estates as a separate series rather than including
them in the assets of the personal sector.
21

These figures are adjusted for the double counting discussed previously in section 2.2.2.

<-----Page 41----->42

reflects, and at the same time may have been a cause of, the high returns to US
financial assets since 1980.22

2.2.2.1 US retirement savings
Pension reserves, which are financial claims of US households, have risen from $195
billion (23 percent of GDP) at the end of 1967 to $8,770 billion (103 percent of
GDP) at the end of 1998. Those 1998 household claims are the liabilities of private
pension funds ($4,355 billion), state and local government pension funds ($2,371
billion), life insurance companies ($1,401 billion) and the US Federal Government
($643 billion).23
Of the $3,233 billion invested in mutual funds and money market funds at the end of
1996, $334 billion was from the 401(k) plans of private pension funds (counted here
as part of private pension fund assets), and a further $620 billion was invested by
households in mutual funds through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The
volume of funds invested under Keogh plans (for self employed persons) is tax data
that is not readily available.

Therefore, putting the Federal Government and

insurance company liabilities to one side, the percentage of financial assets held by
the investment management sector, that arise from corporate, government or
household, tax preferred pension schemes, was at least 74 percent at the end of 1996.

2.2.2.2 US equity holdings by sector
Table 2.10 presents the holdings of US equities by US financial sectors, including
households. Table 2.11 presents the percentage of direct ownership of the US equity
market by private versus institutional owners. Figures 2.10 and 2.11 depict this data
graphically. In 1969, 69 percent of the US equity market was directly held by
households, 26 percent by US institutional investors and 3 percent by foreigners. By
the end of 1998 those figures were 41 percent, 51 percent and 7 percent

22

Warther (1995), Edwards and Zhang (1998) and Edelen and Warner (1999) find a strong

relationship between flows to US mutual funds and returns to US financial assets.

<-----Page 42----->43

respectively.24 Figure 2.10 shows that the migration of equities from household
portfolios to institutional portfolios shows little sign of abating. Figure 2.11 shows
the change since 1969 in the percentage of the US equity market held by the different
components of the investment management sector.

In particular, the figure

highlights the decline in the importance of bank personal trusts and estates as equity
managers and the rise of mutual funds and SLGE retirement funds.
This trend is not just the inevitable result of institutional investors having more
money under management.

Table 2.12 displays the US equity holdings of US

financial sectors as a percentage of their total financial assets. The table shows that
the increased demand of institutional management for US equities reflects three
major trends. Firstly, state and local government employee funds have increased
their aggregate portfolio weight in equities from just 7 percent in 1967 to 62 percent
in 1998 as depicted in figure 2.12. Consequently, the percentage of the US equity
market held in these funds has risen from 0.5 percent in 1967 to 10.3 percent in 1997.
The asset allocation change in state and local government employee funds represents
a major change in risk borne by the tax payers who ultimately insure those funds.25
Secondly, the percentage of the US equity market held by private pension funds
increased from 6.1 percent in 1967 to 14.5 percent at the end of 1998. The increase
occurred despite the fact that asset allocation to US equities of private pension funds
increased only slightly over the period. Such is the scale of the increase in assets of
private pension funds.
Finally, a huge volume of money has flowed into US equity mutual funds in the
1990s.

In the period 1991 to 1998 the value weighting of US equities in the

aggregate portfolio of US mutual funds has increased from 38 percent to 68 percent.
Further, the percentage of the US equity market held by these funds has increased
from 6.4 percent to 16.3 percent. In just seven years in the 1990s, an additional 10
percent of the US equity market came under the control of mutual fund managers.

Tables 2.13 and 2.14 and the corresponding figures 2.13 and 2.14 illustrate the
dynamic process by which equities have been transferred year by year from the
household sector to institutional investors. Table 2.13 shows that in every year since
1977 US households have been net sellers of US equities.
Figure 2.13 captures the flows of equity ownership between the different categories
of owners in five periods since 1949. For each category of stock ownership, the
annual net flow of equities, as a percentage of the total capitalisation of the equity
market, is averaged over 10 year periods and presented in figure 2.13. In the period
1949-58 listed corporations were the only net sellers of stocks, all other categories
including households were net buyers. Listed corporations were net sellers in each
10 year period except 1979-88; a period when US corporations undertook massive
share repurchase programs. In each of the four periods after 1958 households were
net sellers of US equities. In the period 1979-88 the average annual sale of equities
by US households was 2.8 percent of the end of year total market capitalisation of
US listed equities.26
Table 2.13 shows the transit of equities from household portfolios to mutual funds
accelerating through the 1990s. Table 2.14 however, shows that the reduction in
exposure of US households to US equity market risk is in part offset by the
ownership of US mutual funds by US households. In 1996 direct purchases of US
equities by US households was -$281 billion but after accounting for household
ownership of mutual funds the reduction was only -$67 billion.
The flow of money to US mutual funds accelerated through the 1990s to 1997.
Table 2.15 and the accompanying figure 2.15 record the astonishing increase in the
volume of funds managed by US mutual funds and the number of mutual fund
26

Figures 2.10 and 2.13 taken together pose an interesting question. The percentage of US listed

equities, by market capitalisation, owned by US households was 58.2 percent at year end 1979 falling
to 40.7 percent at the end of 1998. In the first 10 years of that period households were net sellers of
2.8 percent of the market to other parties. In the next 10 years the figure averages to 1.9 percent. This
result is made possible in part by the volume of IPOs in this period. In an IPO, an entrepreneur may
be counted as a household which is selling a newly listed equity. The part of the IPO retained by the
entrepreneur increases the recorded equity ownership of households.

<-----Page 44----->45

accounts. US households had 119 million mutual fund accounts (nearly one for each
of the 126 million full time workers in the US labour force) and 32 million money
market fund accounts at the end of 1997.
There is no readily available breakdown of foreign investment in US financial assets
into investments of foreign private investors and foreign institutional investment.
However, given the large fixed cost associated with active overseas investment it is
reasonable to assume that a high percentage of foreign held US financial assets are
controlled by foreign institutional investors. In fact, because of the now substantial
position of foreign investors in US financial assets, the proportion of the US financial
markets controlled by institutional investors may be understated here.

2.2.3 Implications of UK and US data
The UK and US data suggest that the observed large scale delegation of the
management of equities portfolios is driven by some aspect of saving for retirement.
In both countries the growth of portfolios managed for the provision of retirement
income is a large part of the total growth of institutional equity portfolios.
A natural question is why private investors have chosen to save for retirement
income through institutionally managed portfolios rather than just manage their own
portfolio. Asymmetric information, taxes, transactions costs and administrative costs
explain much of the demand for financial intermediation in general and each of those
factors may be important here. It may be possible to estimate the relative effects of
changes in information asymmetry, the tax code and costs on the transfer of the
control of equity portfolios.

Although, identifying and separating changes in

information asymmetry and transactions cost, and establishing their causality in
relation to the volume of institutional management of equities would be difficult.
The question of why investors choose to delegate portfolio management is
intrinsically interesting but not central to the question addressed in this essay; which
is, how has the equity market equilibrium been affected by the transfer of control of
equities from private investors to institutional investors?
The UK and the US data discussed above shows that since 1967 there has been a
substantial transfer of control of equities from private investors to institutional

<-----Page 45----->46

investors in both the UK and the US. Figure 2.16 shows the ratio of household
sector domestic equity holdings to institutional domestic equity holdings in both the
UK and the US from 1975 to 1996. At the beginning of that period the UK ratio was
1.55 and the US ratio 1.66.
The UK ratio of private to institutional equity holdings fell rapidly in the next four
years, principally as a result of pension fund buying of domestic equities in the UK,
as depicted in figure 2.7. The UK ratio continued downward to 0.35 by year end
1997. The US ratio fell to 0.8 at the end of 1998. However, during the period year
end 1985 to year end 1992 the US ratio rose from 1.10 to 1.36. It has been in steep
decline since then.
Whilst the UK ratio of private to institutional domestic equity holdings was only
slightly below that of the US ratio in 1975, in 1996 it was less than one half that of
the US and has been little changed since 1991. The decline in the US ratio shows no
sign of abating. In both 1997 and 1998 the net sales of equities by US households
exceeded $500bn.
A comparison of figures 2.4 and 2.9 shows that in both the US and the UK the rapid
rise of investment management assets as a percentage of GDP began in the early
1980s. The future path of the ratio of private to institutional equity holdings in the
US and UK is not clear.

We should anticipate that corporate and government

pension plans will become more mature in their liability structure over time. In
which case the net contribution to these funds will fall as beneficiary payments
increase. Moreover, as the structure of their liabilities matures, pension plans can be
expected to hold a greater portfolio weight in bonds and credit market instruments, to
match asset income to a more precisely estimated liability stream.

2.3

A review of literature on fund manager incentives

The term incentives means the relationship between outcomes, over which an
economic agent has some control, and the associated reward which accrues to that
agent as a result of the outcome.

This thesis is concerned with the difference

<-----Page 46----->47

between the incentives faced by private investors and institutional investors and the
decisions and concomitant market outcomes that arise from those differences.
For private investors managing a portfolio on their own behalf, incentives are straight
forward. Under reasonable assumptions, the investor can be expected to choose a
portfolio that maximises the sum (integral) of discounted expected utilities over the
agent’s lifetime; with the maximum attained under the assumption that at all future
decision points an optimal portfolio is chosen, whatever the future time or state. This
dynamic programming problem is addressed in many studies, the most important of
which are the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) of Merton (1973)
and the Consumption CAPM of Breeden (1979).
A simplifying aspect of the private investor’s portfolio choice problem is the one-toone relationship between changes in the market value of the portfolio held and
changes in the investor’s end of period wealth. Under reasonable assumptions about
consumption or dis-saving, the value of the private investor’s portfolio at any future
date is an uncomplicated function of the interim total returns on the portfolio. In this
sense the incentives of the private investor are very simple. Moreover, the same
basic incentive structure applies whether the investor is a corporation, which seeks to
maximise firm wealth, or a government authority, which seeks to minimise future tax
collection.

2.3.1 Investment management fees
The incentives of fund managers are more complicated. The first component of an
investment manager’s incentives are the management fees received each period.
Fees are related to portfolio outcomes by the explicit clauses of the investment
management contract between the investor and fund manager.

2.3.1.1 Description of management fees
There are a variety of fees levied on private investors by mutual fund and pension
fund managers. Virtually every contract includes a flat fee which is a percentage of
the value of the portfolio managed in a period. Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny
(1992a) studied US equity pension fund managers and found that one half of all
contracts have flat fees of between 43 and 56 basis points. Halpern and Fowler

<-----Page 47----->48

(1991) surveyed 133 of the largest state and local government schemes.

They

observed fees of 25 to 40 basis points for active equity management of portfolios of
$250 million or more. The fees they observed were: higher for management of
portfolios of international assets; lower for fixed income management (5-10 basis
points); and as low as zero basis points for passive management of large US equity
portfolios. They also found that managers have concave fee schedules, with lower
fees for larger portfolios.
A November 1994 survey by Pensions Management Magazine, found that UK
pension fund managers on average charge 21 basis points for managing funds above
200 million pounds. Fees are higher for management of smaller amounts, with an
average fee of 51 basis points for management of 10 million pounds. Fees for
managing overseas equity portfolios in developed markets averaged 57 basis points
and for emerging markets the figure was 67 basis points.

Fees for passive

management of large UK equity portfolios were as low as 3 basis points.
Investors in mutual funds choose between managers who charge a variety of fees,
including, management, advisory, entry, redemption, exchange and 12b-1 fees.
Investment management firms may levy exchange fees when investors transfer funds
between mutual fund products offered by that house. Since 1980 the US Securities
Exchange Commission has allowed mutual fund managers to deduct 12b-1 fees for
marketing of the fund. Kihn (1996) finds that nearly 50 percent of US mutual funds
levy this annual fee and the median non-zero fee charged is 20 basis points. Further,
50 percent of US mutual funds charge a front end load (entry fee). Kihn found a
median non-zero entry fee of 330 basis points. The majority of actively managed
UK unit trust managers charge an entry fee of between 400 and 600 basis points.
Kihn argues that the division of the mutual fund industry into managers who charge
entry fees and those who do not is explained by the higher quality service provided
by mutual funds with entry fees. A more convincing explanation is provided by
Chordia (1996) who argues that mutual funds provide investors with insurance
against unexpected liquidity shocks. Redemptions are netted against purchases in a
mutual fund. But even if assets must be sold to meet the liquidity shock, the
transaction cost is shared amongst the investors. As a result, funds which have lower

<-----Page 48----->49

entry fees are forced to hold higher cash reserves to prevent buy and hold investors
bearing the cost of market timers entering and leaving the market. Then, because
they are not fully invested, zero load funds have lower expected returns.

2.3.1.2 Boilerplate nature of fees
Some of the most interesting aspects of empirical studies of investment management
fees relate to what is not found. Since 1985 the Securities Exchange Commission
has permitted investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 to charge fees which are a fraction of the capital gain of the client assets.27
However, most institutional managers of mutual fund or pension fund money are
employed on fixed fee contracts (Ippolito 1992, Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny
1992a, Golec 1992, Goode 1993). In a study of mutual fund contracts, Golec found
that only 29 of 476 mutual fund managerial contracts contain performance based fee
components.

Ippolito found that of 373 funds checked in 1988 only 18 used

incentive fees.
Another surprising finding is the uniformity of fees charged by fund managers. We
might expect managers to vary their fees to match market demand for their service,
or that managers might discriminate between investors in charging fees to capture the
maximum amount of investors’ economic surplus. But instead LSV (1992a) and
Golec find little variation in fees levied by pension managers and mutual funds
(except the entry fee).

2.3.1.3 Conclusions from studies of fees
Taken together these studies portray a mutual fund and pension fund investment
management industry in which the fees charged by managers over a period (fund
manager revenue), is a fixed fraction of the funds under management. Moreover,
fees vary little across managers and typically do not have significant performance
related components. Under these circumstances the future stream of income to
managers is directly determined by the future value of funds under management at
27

US registered mutual funds are authorised to use incentive compensation fees under section 205 of

the Investment Advisers Act (1990).

Compensation must rise or fall symmetrically about the

benchmark. The benchmark must be a recognised market index.

<-----Page 49----->50

each date. Therefore, if the per pound cost of management is constant or falling in
the value of funds managed, then increases in fund manager wealth or firm value
arise principally from flow of new funds to managers. The incentives of fund
managers are thus characterised. The variables that determine the flow of funds to
managers are the variables that the manager will wish to control.

Important

exceptions to this characterisation of the investment management industry are hedge
funds (Goetzmann, Ingersoll and Ross, 1997), private banking services and private
equity partnerships (Gompers and Lerner, 1997) in which incentive fees are charged.

2.3.2 The flow of money to mutual funds
2.3.2.1 The funds flow – portfolio performance relationship
Fund managers face implicit incentives, in addition to the explicit incentives of the
investment management contract, because existing contracts may be terminated, or
new contracts may be initiated, on the basis of portfolio outcomes. As a result of
these implicit incentives the relationship between the wealth of a fund manager (or
investment management firm value) at a future date, and the interim portfolio
returns, cannot be assumed to have the same simple structure found in the private
investor’s problem. The empirical studies of fund manager incentives seek to model
the relationship between portfolio outcomes and the flow of funds to institutional
investors. That performance –flow relationship is a crucial input to understanding
fund manager incentives; although, most of the performance-flow studies do not
make a connection between their results and fund manager incentives. Those studies
are reviewed in this section.

2.3.2.2 Early studies of the performance-flow relationship
Despite the positive flow of cash from investors to the mutual fund industry in every
year since 1940, few rigorous studies of the determinants of mutual fund flows were
conducted in the fifty years before 1990. A study prepared by the Wharton School in
1962 created contingency tables to determine whether the top half of the universe of
funds, ranked by total return in one period, received more new money in the next
period than the bottom half. The Wharton study found no evidence of performance
determining the flow of money to balanced funds and only a weak relationship in
equity funds. Williamson (1970) found no significant relationship between funds

<-----Page 50----->51

flow and portfolio performance in a sample of 15 funds. In contrast, Friend, Blume
and Crockett (1970) found a significant positive correlation between mutual fund
returns in one period and net sales of shares by the mutual fund in the next period.
The Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Treynor (1961) development of the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) promised the technology to adjust the performance of
portfolios for market risk. This new technology was employed in Jensen’s (1968)
study of the risk adjusted performance of US equity mutual fund managers. The
Jensen measure of performance is the intercept in the ordinary least squares
regression of portfolio return less the risk free rate, on the market return less the risk
free rate.
Surprisingly, another ten years elapsed between the development of risk adjustment
techniques and their use in the study of the performance-flow relationship. Smith
(1978) ranked 74 US equity mutual funds by their performance in one period and
then the growth of funds managed in the next period; where portfolio performance
was measured by both the Jensen measure and the Forbes annual rating of the fund.
Rank correlations provided no statistically significant evidence of a positive
correlation between portfolio performance in one period and growth of funds under
management in the next period. Woerheide (1982) found negative parameter values
in a regression of the growth rate of mutual funds on fund portfolio returns lagged up
to four years. However, the portfolio returns are not adjusted for risk.
The papers discussed to this point are the first generation of funds flow – portfolio
performance studies. These early studies found either no connection or only a weak
connection between portfolio performance and the flow of new money to funds,
which may explain the subsequent hiatus in funds flow research. With the exception
of Smith (1978), the importance of these early studies is reduced by the small
number of funds in the datasets and the inadequate adjustment of returns for risk.

2.3.2.3 Modern studies of the performance-flow relationship
The next generation of funds flow – performance studies began with the Zeckhauser,
Patel, Hendricks (ZPH 1991) study of the growth of funds managed by 96 no load,
growth mutual funds in the period 1976 to 1987. They seek to characterise and

<-----Page 51----->52

explain irrational behaviour by economic agents in financial markets, and flows to
mutual funds are taken to be one manifestation of irrational behaviour.

The

following equation is estimated.

Equation 2.1
Flowit = αt + β1 Flowit-1 + β2 Sizeit-1 + β3 Returnit-1 + β4 Rankit-1 + εit

Where

Flow = the net dollar inflow after accounting for growth in existing assets
Return = the total return net of expenses and fees
Size = the dollar value of the fund
Rank = the order of the fund in a ranking of funds by Return
i, t

= subscripts to represent the identity of the fund and the time period
respectively.

The specification of equation 2.1 is flawed; an obvious problem is that Flowit-1 is a
function of Returnit-1. Another shortcoming is the pooling of panels of data without
any provision for variation in funds flow by year. Nonetheless, some of the results
are interesting. The coefficient on lagged flow, in a univariate regression, is 0.75 and
is highly significant.

This result, with an R2 of 0.73, suggests that important

variables are missing from equation 2.1. When both Return and Rank are included in
the regression, β3 is significantly negative and β4 is significantly positive. If not for
the model mis-specification, this result might indicate that Rank is a more important
determinant of funds flows than absolute Return.
Santini and Aber (1996) find that rankings in Forbes’ magazine have greater
explanatory power than performance measures in predicting fund flows. In addition,
they argue that due to higher advertising levels and perceptions of reliability, large
funds should grow more quickly, other things equal.
The motivation for the Ippolito (1992) study of the flow of investors’ money to US
mutual funds is to better understand how consumers react to less-than-promised

<-----Page 52----->53

quality in a purchased product. The flows to 143 US equity mutual funds over the
period 1965-1984 are studied in the following fixed effects model.

Equation 2.2
Git = C1 Vi,t-1 + C2 Vi,t-2 + C 3Vi,t-3 + dF + eY + αit

Where

Git

=

The ratio of net sales to beginning of period assets for fund i in period t

Vi,t-1 =

Jensen’s α for fund i in period t-1

F

=

Dummy variable for fund specific effects

Y

=

Dummy variable for year specific effects.

The results show that risk adjusted portfolio returns, lagged up to three years, are
significant in explaining fund flows. A fund that achieved a return of 2 percent in
excess of that commensurate with market risk, over each of three years, on average
grows 1.4 percent faster than a fund with a Jensen’s α of zero. The finding by
Ippolito that risk adjusted returns from several years before the current period are
significant determinants of funds flow, differs from the findings of previous studies
that only the portfolio return in the immediately previous period is significant.
Two results from Ippolito’s study have a bearing on the down-side risks faced by
fund managers. Firstly, Ippolito divides the data into observations for which the fund
has a positive Jensen α measured over five years and those for which the fund has a
negative α over five years. Then separate regressions are run on the two sets of
observations. In the first dataset the coefficient on the five year alpha (measured in
percent) is 0.90 and on the second group it is 0.35. The results reveal an asymmetry
in the response of fund flows to positive and negative portfolio performance.
Secondly, in Ippolito’s dataset 31 funds were merged with other funds over the 20
year dataset period. A logistic examination of the relation between mergers and poor
performance estimates that a fund with a Jensen α of –5.0 percent, measured over

<-----Page 53----->54

five years, has a 50 percent higher probability of merger in the next year than a fund
with the population average α.
Goetzmann, Greenwald and Huberman (GGH 1992) undertake the first large scale
estimation of the funds flow – portfolio performance relationship, with a study of
230 ‘seasoned’ funds that survived the period 1976 to1989. The net dollar inflow in
each fund, after accounting for growth of existing assets, is regressed on the total
return of the fund in the current and each of the previous three years, and the
dependent variable lagged by one, two and three years. GGH argue that the flow of
funds should be measured as dollar growth rates, rather than a percentage of assets
managed, because otherwise the results will be dominated by small fund growth rates
which are either unsustainably high or omitted due to survivorship bias.

A

consequence of studying flows in dollar terms is that the parameters of the regression
are dependent upon the total flow of money to mutual funds in a year. Therefore
cross-sectional regressions cannot be pooled across years.

GGH estimate an

equation for each year in the dataset. They find that flows in the current period are
significantly dependent upon the total return lagged by one year (but not the current
year or longer lags), and the flow of funds in each of the previous three years.
Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (LSV 1992a) focus on the pension fund industry.
They study the relationship between the relative performance of US equity pension
fund managers and the number of new pension fund management mandates captured
by those managers. The dataset covers 359 investment management firms in the
period 1985 to1989. For each 1 percent that the return of a manager exceeded the
value weighted return to the universe of managers over the previous three years, the
number of new mandates signed the next year increases by 1.3 percent.
Berkowitz and Kotowitz (1993) study the flow of money to Canadian mutual funds.
They estimate the parameters in the following equation on observations of an
unbalanced panel of about 40 mutual funds in the period 1977 to 1986.

Equation 2.3
lnPit+1 = const + β1 lnPit + β2 Rit + β3 Rit-1 + β3 Rit-2 + {Dummies} + εit

<-----Page 54----->55

Where

Pit+1

=

the value of assets held by fund i at the end of period t+1

Rit

=

is the risk adjusted return of fund i in period t

Dummies =

represents dummy variables for large funds, load funds, and each of
the years in the dataset.

This specification reflects the benefits of using levels rather than returns, and
separating out the effects of individual years, that are noted by Goetzmann,
Greenwald and Huberman (1992). The results show a stronger relationship between
flows and portfolio returns than previous studies. A fund that achieved a Jensen α of
2 percent in each of the previous three years would expect a net flow of new funds of
4.8 percent of the current value of the fund in the current year.
Rockinger (1995) studies the flow of money to US mutual funds in a dynamic panel
data model which nests previous models of Zeckhauser, Patel and Hendricks (1991),
Ippolito (1992) and Sirri and Tufano (1998). The model has the following structure.

Equation 2.4
git = α + gi,t-1γ +x´itβ + z´iδ + uit
uit = ui + λt + ξJ + vit
vit = ρvit-t + wit

Where

git = the growth rate of the assets of mutual fund i during period t attributable to
net sale of fund shares
x´it = factors that vary across funds and through time, including measures of the
performance of the fund in previous periods
z´I = variables characteristic of individual mutual funds, such as fees, expense
ratio, turnover ratio
uI = a fund specific residual effect
λt = time specific residual effect

<-----Page 55----->56

ξJ = investment style specific residual effect.

The Ippolito (1992) measure is obtained if the dynamics of the residual effect and the
investment style effects are eliminated (ρ = 0 and ξJ = 0) and x´it is set to [pi,t-1, pi,t-2,
pi,t-3]´ where pi,t-1 is the portfolio performance in the previous period. Rockinger
shows that these restrictions introduce inconsistency in parameter estimates.
Rockinger finds that a 1 percent higher alpha (Jensen’s 1968 measure) in one period,
on average causes a 6.6 percent increase in the growth rate of the fund next period.
This is a substantially higher sensitivity to fund performance than found in most
previous studies. However, the results also show that the rank of the mutual fund
within its investment objective group is the most important determinant of increased
flow of money to mutual funds (Zeckhauser, Patel and Hendricks, 1991, Rockinger,
1995, Santini and Aber, 1996). Rockinger finds that larger funds, other things equal,
grow less quickly, however this effect is only important for the largest funds.

2.3.2.4 Non-linear studies of the performance-flow relationship
Sirri and Tufano (1998) study 690 US equity mutual funds in the period 1971 to
1990. They find that investors base their choice of mutual fund upon historical
investment performance, fees charged and services provided. However, the main
contribution of their paper is to demonstrate that the relationship between funds flow
and risk adjusted returns is non-linear and should be estimated as such.
Sirri and Tufano look at the performance sensitivity of fund flows for funds with
recent extreme performance. The very highest performers enjoy growth rates many
times those of other funds. Funds are ranked each year by portfolio return and then
formed into twenty groups, with funds in group twenty having the highest returns.
The growth of the funds in each group in the following year is then examined.
Groups 1-18 show little variation, but group 19, and especially group 20, have huge
growth (55 percent in group 20). For all other groups there is almost no relationship
between performance and flow of funds. This is a powerful result which surely
demonstrates that an assumption of linearity in the flow – performance relationship

<-----Page 56----->57

leads to an underestimation of the sensitivity of funds flow to portfolio performance
for the highest ranked funds.
Sirri and Tufano then conduct the following piecewise linear regression to explain
the flow of money to funds in the bottom 20 percent, middle 60 percent and top 20
percent by portfolio performance.

Equation 2.5
FLOWi,t = α + β1 TNAi,t-1 + β2 OBJFLOWt + β3 Ranki,t-1 + γ1
LOWPERFi,t-1 + γ2 MIDPERFi,t-1 + γ3 HIGHPERFi,t-1 + εit

Where FLOWi,t

=

percentage growth of fund i in period t after accounting for growth
of existing funds

TNAi,t-1

=

asset value of fund i at the end of period t-1

OBJFLOWt

=

aggregate flow of funds the investment management category of
fund i in period t

RANKi,t-1

=

portfolio performance rank of fund i [0,1] amongst all funds in
period t-1

LOWPERFi,t-1 =

Min (Ranki,t-1 , 0.2)

MIDPERFi,t-1 =

Min (0.6 , RANKi,t-1 – LOWPERFi,t-1)

HIGHPERFI,t-1 =

RANKi,t-1 – (LOWPERFi,t-1 + MIDPERFi,t-1).

Sirri and Tufano report the regression results for five different measures of return
upon which the ranks are formed: total return over 1 year; total return over 3 years;
excess to index return over 1 year; Jensen’s alpha over 1 year; and Jensen’s alpha
over 5 years. In each of the five regressions the parameters on HIGHPERF and
MIDPERF are highly significant and the parameters on LOWPERF are insignificant.
The parameter values on HIGHPERF are much the largest. The parameters indicate
that the flow of money to mutual funds is convex in the performance rank of the fund
in the previous year. When the funds are ranked by total portfolio return over one
year, then for the top 20 percent of funds a 5 percentile increase in rank leads on

<-----Page 57----->58

average to a 9 percent increase in the flow of funds in the next year. The regressions
also indicate that, other things equal, smaller funds grow at a faster rate.
Chevalier and Ellison’s (1997a) study of mutual fund flows seeks to estimate the
functional form of the relationship between the portfolio performance of a mutual
fund and the flow of investors’ money to that mutual fund. Most other studies of
mutual fund flows assume a linear relationship between the growth rate of funds and
the explanatory variables. The exceptions being Ippolito and Sirri and Tufano who
assume piecewise linear models with two and three segments respectively. With data
on 839 US equity funds, Chevalier and Ellison (1997a) firstly reject a piecewise
linear model and then fit the following semi-parametric model.

Equation 2.6
Flowit+1 = (1 + Σk γk Age_kit) f(rit - rmt) + Σk δk Age_kit + α’Xit + εit

Where

Flowit+1 =

the percentage growth in assets attributable to net purchase of shares

Age_kit =

a dummy variable for the age of the fund

rit - rmt =

the excess return of the mutual fund portfolio over the market portfolio

f( )

=

non-linear function which is to be estimated

Xit

=

a vector of additional explanatory variables which includes rit-1-rmt-1,
rit-2 – rmt-2, growth in mutual fund industry assets and the log of fund
size.

A three step kernel estimation process is implemented to estimate the value of α
coefficients, then δ and γ coefficients, and finally the function f. The result is an
estimate of a functional relationship between growth of funds managed by a fund and
the excess market return in the previous year rit - rmt; whilst holding constant the
excess return in previous years, the flow of funds to all mutual funds and the mutual
fund size. The results indicate that the flow of new funds is a convex function in
positive values of the excess return rit - rmt and a concave function in negative values
of rit - rmt. A mutual fund which: is two years old; had an excess-to-benchmark

<-----Page 58----->59

return of 10 percent this year; had zero excess returns in the past two years; and
matched the geometric mean of fund sizes; would be expected to grow by 55 percent
next year if the industry growth were zero. This result corroborates the finding of
Sirri and Tufano that the growth of the highest ranked funds is very large.
Chevalier and Ellison also estimate a linear model of funds flow. The results show
that for a two year old fund, each percent of excess return increases the growth of
funds under management by 3.3 percent. This result shows that the linear model
understates the sensitivity of funds flow to performance for the highest ranked funds.
A curious result is that, other things equal, the flow of money to mutual funds with
shorter histories is greater. This result matches a similar finding by Ippolito. A
partial explanation of this phenomena is provided by the Hiring and Firing model in
chapter 6.

2.3.2.5 Causality in the portfolio performance – funds flow relationship
Implicit in the results of studies of the portfolio performance – funds flow
relationship that are reviewed here is the assumption that variation in portfolio
performance causes variation in the volume of funds that flow to those portfolios.
The relationship may be more complicated because we might expect fund managers
with large cash flows to earn higher returns for several reasons. Managers with large
positive cash flows can hold smaller cash balances than other managers and hence
have a higher expected return for their portfolio. The new funds must be invested
and hence incur transactions costs, however, in the US, a fund that is growing
quickly typically has less unrealised capital gains tax which is attractive to new
investors in high tax brackets.
Spitz (1970) looked at whether investors choose funds that subsequently perform
well. A significant link was not established. More recently Gruber (1996) finds that
new money on average earns a higher return than money already invested in mutual
funds. Gruber postulates the existence of clienteles of sophisticated investors who
change funds from time to time and unsophisticated investors who earn lower
returns. Zheng (1999) finds that mutual fund investment strategies that follow the
flow of money earn significantly positive risk adjusted excess returns.

<-----Page 59----->60

The findings of Gruber and Zheng support to some extent the notion that the flow of
funds to portfolios influences the subsequent returns of those portfolios.

The

findings of Sirri and Tufano (1998) and Chevalier and Ellison (1997a) regarding the
flow of money to the best performed managers is so strong that it is difficult to argue
that flows causing returns is the full story. However, feedback from flows to returns
is plausible and appears to have some empirical support.

If this feedback is

substantial then all the tests reported here have endogeneity on both sides and are
therefore not correctly specified tests.

2.3.2.6 Other econometric issues in funds flow studies
The studies reviewed to this point are essentially the same in that they seek to
determine the relationship between the flow of money to mutual funds by the
application of regression techniques to panel datasets. Econometric issues are crucial
in assessing the veracity of these studies.

As always, the first issue is model

specification. The most obvious inadequacy of most of the studies is the assumption
of a linear relationship between flows and portfolio performance.
There seems to be no reason to assume a linear relationship. Ippolito (1992), Sirri
and Tufano (1998), and Chevalier and Ellison (1997a) comprehensively reject the
assumption of linearity. Their combined results indicate that flow of money to
mutual funds is convex in positive risk adjusted returns of the fund. In this case,
linear models will overestimate the sensitivity of flows to small positive portfolio
returns and underestimate the sensitivity of flows to large returns. Further, rank
correlation tests, such as that by Smith (1978) have less power if the performanceflow relationship is non-linear.
Sirri and Tufano find that only the top 10 percent of funds, ranked by portfolio
returns, exhibit a strong correlation between performance and growth. This finding
is consistent with investors’ mutual fund choices being influenced by the rank of a
mutual fund versus a peer group. However, the implication is that all the ‘action’ is
in the few funds with the highest performance in each investment category. If that is
true then an estimation procedure that equally weights all observations is
inappropriate. It is difficult to say why the studies do not simply include the square

<-----Page 60----->61

and cube of excess-to-benchmark returns. It may be better to guess the form of nonlinearity and proceed on that basis than just assume linearity.
Another specification issue is the inclusion of fixed effects. The panels of data
employed in performance-flow studies present difficult econometric problems which
are glossed over for the most part. Studies that simply pool the cross-sectional fund
data and do not include fund, investment management objective and year effects are
not properly specified. That includes all of the studies before 1990. But there are
other problems, such as, omitted variables. The omitted variables problem can be
mitigated by the inclusion of lagged variables, but then there is no standard way to
evaluate the significance of the lag coefficients in panel data.
It is difficult to assess the importance of survivorship bias in these studies. If the
funds missing from a dataset are those that experienced low growth of assets and low
returns then the estimated regression parameters will understate the magnitude of the
correlation between funds flows and portfolio returns. Grinblatt and Titman (1988)
find that survivorship bias in mutual fund datasets is not large in absolute terms; the
total return of surviving funds exceeds the total return of all funds by one percent.
But one percent is important in terms of the rank of funds. Moreover that average of
one percent may represent large under-performance by a few funds.
Survivorship bias may at least partially explain the asymmetry of the funds flow –
portfolio performance relationship, where the best performed funds receive most of
the new money but the poor performing funds lose little. Goetzmann, Greenwald
and Huberman argue that if funds with low returns and consequent large outflow of
money are absent from a dataset then a spurious asymmetry in the relationship will
arise. The magnitude of survivorship bias in regression studies of the funds flow –
performance relationship is unknown but it seems reasonable to assume that
survivorship bias leads to an understatement of the strength of the relationship
between under-performance by a manager and the flow of money out of that
manager’s fund.
Whether the dependent variable is a percentage change in funds managed or a dollar
change, it is measured with considerable inaccuracy. This measurement error does

<-----Page 61----->62

not bias parameter estimates but does lead to overstatement of t values. However, if
lagged dependent variables are included then parameter values are biased towards
zero, causing an understatement of the strength of the funds flow – portfolio
performance relationship.
Ideally we want to estimate the relationship between the performance over several
previous periods and the growth in fund manager wealth or firm value in this period.
This objective poses several problems which have not yet been solved. Chevalier
and Ellison estimate the increase in funds under management as a function of rit - rmt,
but to characterise fund manager incentives we really need the capitalised value of
future fees as a function of rit-rmt, rit-1-rmt-1, rit-2-rmt-2 and longer lags. This requires the
estimation of a multivariate function rather than a univariate function as in Chevalier
and Ellison.
A problem faced by all of these estimation attempts is that we want to accurately
estimate the function over a wide range of returns but there are only a few funds that
achieve very high excess returns and very low excess returns. A great deal of data is
required to accurately estimate the relationship between very high or very low
performance.
There is a more fundamental problem in empirically estimating the incentives faced
by fund managers. The required relationship is between performance in the next
period and the wealth of the fund manager. To estimate that relationship we need to
know how excess return this period affects changes in funds managed next period
and all future periods; assuming that fund managers choose wealth maximising
portfolios at each future date. The point here is that the return this period affects
fund manager wealth not only because funds under management increase but because
the choice set faced by the manager changes.
Another way to explain this point is as follows. Chevalier and Ellison estimate a
relationship between performance this period and fund growth last period. The
expected growth in total funds next period is therefore estimated. If the value of an
investment management firm is directly proportional to size, then the increase in
wealth associated with the excess return achieved (the incentive schedule) has been

<-----Page 62----->63

estimated. However, a mutual fund with $100 million in assets which has a history
of high performance may have a higher value than a fund with a poor performance
history. In that way the return this period affects the value not only through the size
of the fund but through future options for the fund manager.
Chevalier and Ellison estimate that a mutual fund which: is two years old; achieved
zero excess returns in the past two years; matched the geometric mean of fund sizes;
and achieved an excess return of 10 percent; would be expected to grow by 55
percent next year if the industry growth were zero.

This example illustrates a

problem with the approach taken by all the studies mentioned here. In solving their
optimisation problems fund managers give greater weight to low probability events
(high and low excess portfolio returns) because of the non-linearity in their incentive
schedule. However, these are the points that are estimated with the least accuracy.
With the current estimation techniques it will always be difficult to estimate the
degree of convexity of the fund manager’s incentive schedule simply because
extreme returns are unusual.

2.3.2.7 Studies of fund manager employment termination
Two studies apply limited dependent variable techniques to study the relationship
between the portfolio performance of mutual funds and change of manager of the
fund. Khorana (1996) studies portfolio managers and the investment management
firms that employ them. In particular, 339 observations of the replacement of the
portfolio manager of a US mutual fund is created and a logit analysis is undertaken to
identify the variables that determine the probability that a mutual fund will
experience a change of manager in a particular period. The following equation is
estimated.

Equation 2.7

ARτ-1

adjusted portfolio return where the adjustment is for either market
risk or the return of the universe of peer managers.

=

In regressions where asset growth and portfolio performance are both included,
Khorana finds that the parameters on both are negative and significant. Each percent
of asset growth, above that of the weighted average of peer funds, in either of the
past two periods, is estimated to decrease the probability of dismissal by about 14
percent. One percent of risk adjusted excess portfolio returns in the previous year
decreases dismissal probability by 8 percent and for one year further back the
reduction is 3 percent. The results indicate that only recent performance is important
in these decisions.
Results from logit studies which use panel datasets are problematic at best. Ordinary
least squares parameters are not biased if the missing regressors are orthogonal to
included regressors.

However, in logit studies, parameter estimates are not

consistent if there are missing variables, which seems very plausible in this simple
model which has a pseudo R2 of about only 0.16. Another questionable aspect of
Khorana’s results is the large negative intercept values. If a fund experiences zero
asset growth and zero adjusted return over the previous and lagged periods, which
would presumably represent a fairly typical observation, then the probability of the
manager being dismissed is estimated as –1.8.
Chevalier and Ellison (1997b) undertake a probit analysis of the turnover of mutual
fund portfolio managers which is very similar to that of Khorana (1996). From the
Morningstar Mutual Funds on Disc CD ROMs they identify 348 manager turnover
events in the years 1992 to 1994. Like Khorana they find that risk adjusted returns
are highly significant in explaining the probability of turnover of a manager in a
period and that the performance of the manager in the past year is much more
important than other years in this decision.

<-----Page 64----->65

To estimate the importance of the length of a manager’s service in the industry, the
product of risk adjusted return and age less median age of peer managers is included
as an explanatory variable. The probit analysis suggests that, a manager of average
age, whose portfolio return lags the mean return of investment category peers by 10
percent, is 6 percent more likely to turn over than the average manager. However, a
manager with the same performance who is 10 years younger is 12 percent more
likely to turnover than the average manager.

2.3.3 What is known about the incentives faced by fund managers?
The purpose of studying fund manager incentives in this essay is to better understand
how the trading behaviour of institutional investors differs from that of private
investors as a result of differences in their incentives. Moreover, to understand what
those differences mean for market outcomes. The previous sections of this essay
reviewed studies of the relationship between the portfolio performance of a fund
manager and the flow of money into that manager’s fund. What then do these
performance-flow studies tell us about the incentives faced by fund managers?
To understand fund manager maximising behaviour, what is needed is an objective
function that relates a manager’s choice variables to the quantity that the manager
wishes to maximise.

For instance, the manager’s expected lifetime utility of

consumption (or the value of the investment management firm) as a function of: the
asset weights of the chosen portfolio; or the estimated moments of the total return of
the chosen portfolio; or the estimated moments about the excess-to-benchmark
return. The results of the performance-flow studies take us part of the way toward
understanding those relationships.
Consider, equation 2.8, which shows the maximisation problem of a manager that
chooses portfolio weights to maximise expected lifetime utility of consumption (see
Ingersoll 1987). The solution to this dynamic programming problem is a function
which relates optimal portfolio weights to state variables of the problem.

The significance of the performance-flow studies for the maximisation problem is in
understanding the functional form of end of period wealth W(.). In the private
investor’s optimal portfolio choice problem, wealth at time t is a simple function of
the time 0 wealth, consumption to time t and portfolio returns to time t. Equation 2.9
shows the simple law of motion followed by the state variable wealth in the private
investor’s dynamic optimisation problem. It is typically assumed that consumption
is a simple monotonic function of beginning of period wealth.

at time t-1.

The performance-flow studies show that the relationship between portfolio return
and wealth is more complicated for the fund manager. The law of motion of the state
variable wealth in the manager’s dynamic optimisation problem is correspondingly
more complex. To simplify, it might be assumed that the wealth of a manager (or
alternatively the value of an investment management firm) is a linear function of the
value of money managed.28 In that case, the net flow of money into a manager’s fund
is directly proportional to increases in end of period wealth. The law of motion
governing fund manager wealth is then as shown in equation 2.10.

rpt-1 = return to the managed portfolio (as opposed to the fund managers personal
wealth portfolio) in the period starting at time t-1

than rt-1.

To determine the existence of, and form of, a solution to the fund manager’s
problem, and then compare it to the solution of the private investor’s problem, a
functional form must be assumed for the performance-flow relationship F(rt-1 , ∆).
This task is left to follow up research. It is assumed here that a unique solution to the
manager’s problem exists and has the property that the expected lifetime utility of the

This assumption implies that there is no finite optimum size of the fund – the manager simply seeks

to maximise the volume of funds under management. The assumption ensures that the manager
portfolio choice problem does not include a simultaneous consideration of costs and revenues. If the
precision of a manager’s estimates of asset return moments is related to the amount spent on research,
then the portfolio choice and research costs will be determined simultaneously. The problem is not
considered here.

The performance-flow studies model F(.), the percentage increase in the value of a
manager’s portfolio from net flow of new money, as a function of rt-1, which is the
portfolio performance in the previous period, and other variables ∆t-1; which include
lags of portfolio performance. Figure 2.1 depicts a relationship between portfolio
performance in the current period and the manager’s wealth (or the firm value) at the
end of the current period. This relationship can be thought of as the incentive
schedule that the manager faces in choosing the optimal portfolio. It relates an
outcome over which the manager has some control, the portfolio performance, to the
reward to the manager, namely, the manager’s end of period wealth. The figure
summarises the contribution of performance-flow studies to the understanding of
fund manager incentives.

Various measures of portfolio performance are employed in the empirical mutual
fund flow studies. The measure with the most explanatory power over the flow of
funds is the rank of the manager within the group of managers which have the same
investment management objective (aggressive growth, growth, income, small cap
etc.), where rank is formed on the basis of total return over the previous period. This
result is intuitive in that much of the fund performance information presented to
investors by investment journals and investment advisors is in the form of rankings;
such as, ‘#1 fund’, ‘top decile performance’, ‘top quartile performance in every three
year rolling window since 1986’ etc. The performance-flow studies indicate that
whether the rank is formed on the basis of risk adjusted returns, or alternatively
unadjusted total returns, makes little difference.

In the pension fund industry,

performance results are usually presented in terms of the rank of the manager’s
performance within the universe of peer managers. Again results are typically not
adjusted for risk.
The performance-flow studies show that the excess-to-benchmark return of the
portfolio also has significant explanatory power over the flow of funds. It is not
clear to what degree the excess-to-benchmark return is a signal of manager quality
which is considered by investors, rather than a proxy for the rank of the manager’s
return within a peer group. Ideally, in modelling the incentive schedule of a fund

<-----Page 69----->70

manager, portfolio performance would be represented by the rank of the manager’s
performance.

However, in this essay the excess-to-benchmark return is chosen

instead because of its far greater analytical tractability.
The shape of the incentive schedule has the following features which are drawn from
the results of the studies of Ippolito (1992), Sirri and Tufano (1998), and Chevalier
and Ellison (1997a). The schedule is convex in positive portfolio performance and
concave in negative portfolio performance. Only the best performed funds over the
last period have a substantial flow of funds to the manager’s portfolio. The degree of
concavity in under-performed funds is muted compared to the convexity of flows in
highly performed funds. This result may be explained by the cost of changing
managers, cognitive dissonance and survivorship bias.29 Unfortunately, the results of
the performance-flow studies do not provide any functional characterisation of the
manager’s incentive schedule.30 Further study is required to estimate a functional
form for the fund manager incentive schedule that is amenable to analysis.
The schedule depicted in figure 2.1 is drawn with several important variables held
constant including, lagged portfolio performance values and the level of marketing
effort. The estimation procedure of Chevalier and Ellison shows that the schedule is
steeper for younger funds, meaning that for the same excess return the growth of the
fund is greater. The performance-flow studies show that mutual fund investors
consider the returns in at least the three previous years when choosing mutual funds
in which to invest. This means that the manager’s incentive schedule is drawn for a
particular performance history and if that history is changed, then the schedule will
be altered; certainly in location and perhaps in shape.

29

The cost of changing managers includes the extra taxes arising from early realisation of capital

gains. Further, the loss of the real option to delay a decision about whether to withdraw funds from
the manager until some uncertainty about the manager’s capacity to add value has been resolved; as
discussed in chapter 6.
30

Simple polynomial, exponential or trigonometric functions have the form depicted in figure 2.1

over appropriate ranges. For instance, a polynomial such as W1 = W0(1+rpt) +(rt-1)3; an exponential
function such as W1 = W0(1+rpt) + exp(rt-1) – exp(-rt-1); or a trigonometric function W1 = W0(1+rpt) +
tan-1 (rt-1).

<-----Page 70----->71

In studying the dynamic hedging behaviour of fund managers it is precisely the
changes in the performance history of the manager’s portfolio that are of interest.
Consider the following example. Assume that the percentage growth in a manager’s
portfolio is proportional to the cube of the sum of excess-to-benchmark returns in the
previous three years, where growth can take the percentage values (-100 , ∞).
Further, that the fund manager’s wealth is directly proportional to the value of the
fund’s assets and the manager’s consumption in each period is zero. Fund manager
wealth at t and t+1 is as shown in equation 2.12.

In going from the incentive schedule at time t-1 to that at time t, there are two effects.
Firstly, the schedule is moved ‘up’ by the positive values of rpt which increase the
value of the portfolio assets and, in proportion, the manager’s wealth. The second
effect is that the schedule is moved to the left if rpt-rmt > rpt-3-rmt-3. That is, when the
window moves forward one year, if the performance figures that drop out are
exceeded by those that come into the window, then the schedule moves to the left.
Conversely, if rpt-rmt < rpt-3-rmt-3 then the schedule moves to the right in the incentive
schedule diagram. Another way to conceptualise the shift in the incentive schedule
is to note that the point of inflexion of the curve moves from {Wt-1(1+rpt-1) , -(rpt-2-rmt2

+ rpt-3-rmt-3)} at time t-1 to {Wt(1+rpt) , -(rpt-1-rmt-1 + rpt-2-rmt-2)} at time t. This

dynamic response of the incentive schedule provides a framework in which to
analyse the dynamic hedging of fund managers. Figure 2.2 depicts two cases of
shifts in the incentive schedule. Curve A is the schedule at time t. Curve B is the

<-----Page 71----->72

schedule at time t+1 where Wt > Wt-1 and rpt-rmt > rpt-3-rmt-3. Curve C is the schedule
at time t+1 where Wt > Wt-1 and rpt-rmt < rpt-3-rmt-3.31
The shape of the manager’s incentive schedule and the shifting of the schedule
through time lead to two important conclusions. The first arises from the asymmetry
Figure 2.2

Shifts in the fund manager incentive schedule

Wt+1, Wt

B

A

of the schedule, which is concave in negative portfolio performance and convex in
positive portfolio performance. This ensures that, other things equal, risk averse
managers will place a higher value than private investors on securities that have
return distributions which are skewed to the right. The significance for market
outcomes of this preference heterogeneity across investors is discussed in section 2.5
The second conclusion relates to the reaction of fund managers after high portfolio
performance. It is often postulated in the finance literature that if a manager, who is
remunerated on the basis of calendar year portfolio return, experiences high returns
early in the year, then the manager will reduce risk as the year end approaches to
‘lock in’ portfolio returns.

Conversely managers with poor performance are

postulated to increase portfolio risk.
31

Changes in the shape of the incentive schedule arising from an increase in fund size, for instance,

are being ignored here.

<-----Page 72----->73

To analyse this question assume that the manager has a subjective probability
distribution over rpt-1 - rmt-1 which is unchanged by the manager’s evolving portfolio
performance history. Further, assume that the manager’s utility function exhibits
constant relative risk aversion, so that changes in the manager’s wealth does not
affect portfolio choice. Under these conditions, consider a manager whose incentive
schedule relates end of period wealth to the arithmetic average of excess-tobenchmark return over the four quarters of a calendar year. If after three quarters the
average is large and positive then the fund manager’s incentive schedule will have
moved to the left. This shift moves the convex portion of the incentive schedule
toward the centre of the probability distribution of rpt-1 - rmt-1 in which case the
manager will increase the variance of the portfolio. We might then expect managers
with high performance up to the third quarter to take on more risk and managers with
poor performance to reduce risk.

2.3.4 Strategic behaviour and hedging by fund managers
The results of the performance-flow studies, in aggregate, can be used to characterise
incentive schedules for fund managers. The incentive schedules of fund managers
determine how they modify the risk of the managed portfolio; that is, how they hedge
their exposure. Several studies examine how managers react to changes in their
evolving portfolio performance histories.
Orphanides (1996) studies risk taking behaviour of US mutual fund portfolio
managers that results from the agency relationship between a portfolio manager and
the investment management firm that employs that manager. In each quarter of the
periods 1976 to 1993 the variation of a manager’s portfolio return, about the median
return of the universe of peer managers, is estimated from daily returns as the
portfolio ‘risk’.

Then the quarterly risk is regressed on: the calendar-year-to-date

excess return of the portfolio multiplied by dummies for each quarter; plus the square
and cube of those excess returns with multiplicative dummies; plus other fundspecific terms.
The study finds the following patterns in the risk taking behaviour of US equity
mutual fund managers.

There is substantial seasonal variation of the risk in

managers’ portfolios with the level of risk highest in the first quarter.

Fund

<-----Page 73----->74

managers with high excess returns early in the calendar year reduce their portfolio
risk as the year goes on, but this effect is only significant in the later years of the
period covered by the dataset. In contrast, managers with negative excess returns
early in the year on average increase the risk of their portfolios but this pattern is
only observed in the early years of the dataset period.
Orphanides argues that for many portfolio managers the annual bonus is capped at
some multiple of their salary and therefore managers with high performance early in
the year face an effective incentive schedule which is concave in their excess returns
for the rest of the year. An alternative explanation is that high performance leads to
increased wealth and in turn greater risk aversion, which counteracts the effect
shifting the incentive schedule to the left.
In an attempt to explain the ‘January effect’, Cuny, Fedenia and Haugen (1995)
examine the year-end trading behaviour of fund managers and find that some
managers of mutual funds and pension funds track the S&P 500 index towards the
end of the year and then re-establish their ‘bets’ in the new year.
In the study of manager turnover, Khorana (1996) finds that mutual funds which
experience a change of fund manager exhibit significantly higher levels of market
and total risk in the periods leading up to the departure than a sample of funds
matched by investment objective in which managers do not depart. The causality of
fund manager departure and increased portfolio volatility is not precisely determined
in the study.

Nonetheless, it appears that managers act as though their tenure

represents an option with limited downside risk. A finding in the Khorana study that
impacts on the Hiring and Firing essay in chapters 5 and 6 is that, other things equal,
a manager is less likely to depart, the higher the volatility of the assets managed.
Chevalier and Ellison (1997b) use the portfolio holdings of 839 mutual funds in
September and December to study how fund managers modulate the risk of their
portfolio in the face of changing incentives. They find that between September and
December mutual fund managers change the risk of their portfolios in a way that is
consistent with the incentives faced in September.

<-----Page 74----->75

In each of these studies of the reaction of fund managers to an evolving performance
history, the risk faced by the fund manager is characterised in terms of the managed
portfolio’s total variance or the variance of the excess-to-benchmark return. Yet the
asymmetry of the manager’s incentive schedule, with convexity on one side and
concavity on the other, may induce the most interesting aspects of dynamic hedging
by fund managers. We should expect the effects of asymmetry to result from the
third moment of managers’ portfolio returns rather than the second.
Ross (1998) looks at how the concavity of an investors utility function is altered
when the incentive schedule is convex. He finds the surprising result that the risk
aversion of an investor is not necessarily increased when the incentive schedule goes
from linear to convex.

2.4

A comparison of optimisation problems

In this section the optimisation problems of private investors and institutional
investors are compared with a view to identifying differences that may lead to
different trading behaviour. The discussion proceeds through all of the components
of the basic portfolio choice problems faced by these economic agents. This exercise
helps to separate differences in the behaviour of the two types of investor that arise
from heterogeneous incentives, which is the focus of this dissertation, from the
trading differences that arise from other factors.

The discussion also serves as

background to the chapter 3 analysis of the theoretical explanations of fund manager
herding.

2.4.1 Decision making
Private investors can be assumed to choose their own portfolios. A great deal of
advice is proffered by brokers and other intermediaries but essentially the private
investors take asset choice and timing decisions for their own portfolios.
As discussed in chapter 1, delegated portfolio management typically involves two
levels of agency and therefore two levels of decision making. The first level is the
investment management firm and the second is the individual fund managers who are

<-----Page 75----->76

the employees of that firm. The allocation of decision making rights to each level
varies widely across fund management firms. Often the investment management
firm will set asset allocation guidelines, if that is an issue, and be active in market
timing decisions. In addition, the firm may form lists that define the set of assets that
can or cannot be held.
A more important distinction between the decisions taken by individual fund
managers and the investment management firm is that the firm must take decisions
across a set of funds which, from the firm’s perspective, form a portfolio of options.32
A tractable approach to studying the effects of delegated portfolio management is to
recognise only one level of decision making in the investment management firm.
Then, consider the decision maker to be the investment management firm when
studying the interaction between funds within the firm, and to consider the decision
maker to be an individual fund manager when studying the effect of the choice of
individual assets at the portfolio level.

2.4.1.1 Objective function
The assumption that private investors maximise expected utility arises directly from
the theory of choice under uncertainty which is founded on a remarkably modest set
of axioms over how individuals rank payoff distributions.33 If the fund manager is
taken to be an individual, then the objective is again the maximisation of expected
utility. However, if the fund manager is taken to be an investment management firm
and the assumptions of the Fisher Separation Theorem are valid, then the objective
function is the maximisation of firm value. In a problem in which maximisation of
the value of the firm is the objective, all of the portfolios managed by the firm must

32

The mutual funds form an option for the investment management firm because a poor performing

fund can be merged into other funds, with another fund started in its place. Other managed portfolios
are less option like but nonetheless represent a degree of freedom in the investment management
firm’s optimisation problem. For instance, if the firm has information which is correlated with the
future price of a particular stock, and it is known that the firm’s intended buying will move the price
up, then the information must be budgeted across the funds.
33

See Kreps (1990), Huang and Litzenberger (1988), or Ingersoll (1987) for comprehensive

discussions of the theory of choice under uncertainty.

<-----Page 76----->77

be considered jointly. For instance, if a firm has two funds, one of which holds none
of stock A and the other fund holds twice the index weighting in stock A, then what
is the firm’s exposure to stock A?
The performance-flow studies reviewed in section 2.3 showed that the incentives
faced by fund managers differ fundamentally from those faced by private investors in
at least four respects. Firstly, fund manager payoffs are dependent upon relative
rather than absolute returns. Secondly, the relationship between the return on an
individual stock and end of period wealth is linear for a private investor, but highly
non-linear for an institutional investor, with convex and concave components.
Thirdly, there is a one-to-one relation between the end of period wealth of a private
investor and the increases in the value of the portfolio held. The fund manager’s
wealth will typically be much more sensitive to portfolio returns because the
portfolio is typically a large multiple of the fund manager’s wealth. But also because
small increases in portfolio returns can move the manager a long way up the ranking
against peers. Finally, private investors will typically have considerably longer term
investment horizons than institutional investors.34 The empirical performance-flow
studies suggested that the importance of performance results in determining the flow
of funds to a manager decreases rapidly with the age of the performance.

2.4.1.2 Components of the maximisation problem
The major components of the portfolio choice problem are the estimated moments of
the return on assets, the state variables, the asset choice set and constraints on the
choice set.

Investors undertake research with the intention of increasing the

precision of estimates of asset return moments. The amount of resources deployed in
uncovering mispriced securities is an outcome of the maximisation problem.
However, because of their relatively short investment horizons, when choosing assets
to research, fund managers must be cognisant of the speed of price discovery in
assets. Consequently, fund managers may have a tendency to research the same
assets (Brennan 1990). This effect is an example of how the maximisation problems
34

When the Author explained to a fund manager that a proposed programme of doctoral research

would take up to 3 years, the fund manager replied that he could quite conceivably be sacked, hired
elsewhere and become a rising star all within that time frame.

<-----Page 77----->78

of fund managers are linked in a way that the maximisation problems of private
investors are not. Chapter 3 discusses the causes of fund manager herding in a
maximisation framework.
The important state variables for both groups are asset prices and investor wealth.
The fund manager’s problem is slightly different in that the portfolio performance
history enters the problem as a state variable which is a function of past asset prices
and past portfolio weight choices. The private investor’s problem does not have this
dimension of portfolio return history entering the problem, except through wealth.
The asset choice set in the portfolio choice problem of many fund managers is
constrained by a prohibition on holding derivative securities or selling assets short.
Fund managers who have an incentive schedule which is convex in positive excessto-benchmark returns and concave in negative excess-to-benchmark returns, will
value securities with convex payoff schedules such as stock options. Of course such
managers can synthesise the returns to stock options by dynamic trading strategies.
The constraint on short selling may affect a manager’s search for mispriced securities
since information that a stock’s price will fall is of little value to a manager if short
sales are prohibited and the stock is not already held.
In both the US and UK, courts hold fund managers to a ‘prudent person rule’. By
this rule fund managers must be able to demonstrate ex-poste that their portfolio
choices were consistent with the choices of a prudent person. Many investment
professionals believe that fund managers would deploy more resources on
researching the returns of smaller stocks, which are less efficiently priced, were it not
for the prudent person rule.

2.5

Conjectures about unexplained market phenomena

The rise of delegated portfolio management represents a major change in the
composition of decision makers in the market. How might we expect a market in
which institutional investors have a dominant role to differ from that in which
institutional investors are absent? In considering outcomes in financial markets, such

<-----Page 78----->79

as asset price dynamics or the pricing of assets, the finance literature gives little
consideration to who controls the ownership of the assets.
In this section several equity market anomalies are considered in the light of the
findings and considerations of the previous sections of this essay.

The ideas

expressed here are intended to form the basis for ongoing research. Future research
will flow from an understanding of the rise of delegated portfolio management.
However, when reviewing the results of existing research the rise of delegated
portfolio management should also be carefully considered.

Many of the most

influential empirical studies in finance span a part or all of the period (1967-1998) in
which the control of 28 percent of the US equity market has passed from private
investors to institutional investors and foreign investors. If the trading behaviour of
fund managers is fundamentally different from that of private investors then these
studies span a period in which the structure of the market is changing, but make no
allowance for that change.

2.5.1 Dynamic hedging by fund managers
The performance-flow studies reviewed in section 2.3 indicate that investors evaluate
fund managers on the basis of portfolio performance.

The best measure of

performance appears to be the rank of the manager’s total return within the universe
of peer managers, but excess-to-benchmark returns are an adequate proxy for the
analytically intractable rank variable. Where performance is measured relative to an
investable benchmark portfolio, the manager may reduce the variance of the excess
return to zero by holding the benchmark portfolio.35 However, we should expect
managers to trade even if they have zero information simply because a buy and hold
strategy would reveal that the manager has no information (Dow and Gorton 1997).

35

If the manager is measured relative to a universe of peers then the manager can reduce performance

risk to nearly zero by holding the value weighted portfolio of the universe of managers. Some
managers who work for large investment management firms consider their effective remuneration
benchmark to be the ‘house return’. In that case the manager can hedge by holding the weighted
average portfolio of the all firm’s managers within the relevant asset class.

<-----Page 79----->80

In solving the portfolio choice problem in continuous time fund managers will
choose portfolio weight vectors that differ from the index and reflect the precision of
the manager’s private information in each asset and the incentive schedule faced.
The difference between the benchmark vector of asset weights and the manager’s
vector is the vector of manager ‘bets’ against the index. As the price vector evolves
and the manager’s portfolio performance history evolves, the manager will
dynamically hedge by trading to a new portfolio weight vector.
To simplify, consider the following situation. Assume that a manager knows with
certainty that if the portfolio return is more than x percent below the benchmark
return then the manager will be dismissed, which entails a fall in end of period
wealth to zero. In this stylised scenario, the manager has a classic discrete portfolio
insurance problem.36 The difference between portfolio insurance for fund managers
and for private investors is that for fund managers the risk free asset is the
benchmark portfolio (Brennan 1993).
The manager will choose a vector of bets at the beginning of the period and then alter
those bets to maximise end of period expected utility conditional upon the excess-tobenchmark return not falling below –x. Now consider a stock Y which has a market
capitalisation that is 2 percent of the index. Then consider two managers that face
the incentive schedule described above and are identical in every respect except their
heterogeneous information signals for stock Y. Assume that the managers have risk
preferences that exhibit constant absolute risk aversion. Manager A initially holds
none of stock Y and therefore has a 2 percent bet against stock Y. Manager B’s
initial portfolio initially holds 4 percent in stock Y.
information on all other stocks.

The managers have zero

The rest of their portfolio is held in index

proportions and is not traded except for liquidity purposes.

36

See Grossman and Zhou (1996) for an equilibrium analysis of the market outcomes that arise from

the market being divided into portfolio insurers and non-insurers. However, they are not examining
the effect of delegated portfolio management. Their portfolio insurers are insuring against low total
returns rather than low excess-to-benchmark returns.

<-----Page 80----->81

The price vector evolves over the period and the return of stock Y exceeds the index
return by 200 percent. Then, assuming that managers’ expectations over future stock
returns are unchanged, how will the managers react?

To dynamically hedge,

manager A will sell all other stocks in index proportion and buy stock Y. Likewise,
manager B will sell the riskless asset, the market index, and take a larger bet in Y to
dynamically replicate the option on stock Y.
The profound result of this ‘thought experiment’ is that when stock prices rise
significantly, then to dynamically hedge, all managers are induced to buy the stock,
whether they bet for or against the stock. Moreover, there is an asymmetry to this
dynamic hedging. If the price of stock Y was to fall sharply rather than rise sharply,
then manager B would be induced to buy the stock but manager A cannot sell the
stock because of the short sales constraint that most managers face.
What market phenomena could this manager dynamic hedging effect explain?
Firstly, if large changes in a stock’s price induce fund managers to trade in the same
direction then we should expect to see fund manager herding in those stocks. The
testable implication is that more herding should be found in larger stocks. That
hypothesis is tested in detail in the herding essay of chapters 3 and 4 and is shown to
be correct for UK unit trust managers. A second testable prediction is that after
controlling for size, herding should be greater in those stocks in which fund
managers have the largest bets. That implication will be tested in ongoing research.
Secondly, if the fund managers herding into stocks that have changed significantly in
price creates price pressure, then we should expect to see serial correlation in stock
prices. This effect has been widely observed.37 The testable implication is that the
effect should be greater in large stocks and stocks in which fund managers take the
largest bets. Sias and Starks (1997) find that, after conditioning for size, daily serial
correlation in stock prices is monotonically increasing in the proportion of a stock
that is held by institutional investors.

See, for instance, Jagadeesh and Titman (1993) or Lo and MacKinlay (1990).

Finally, consider who is on the other side of these dynamic hedging trades. We
should expect the dynamic hedging demand for stocks to be met by private investors
who are concerned with total returns and not excess-to-benchmark returns. If private
investors provide this dynamic insurance to fund managers, then when we measure
the performance of fund managers versus index benchmarks we should not be
surprised to see that fund managers under-perform the benchmark even after
accounting for fees, expenses and traditional risk factors.

2.6

Concluding remarks

The purpose of this essay is to highlight the importance of the rise of delegated
portfolio management. In the first section the massive transfer of the control of
financial assets in the UK and US is documented in a series of tables and figures.
The essay then brings together results from a large number of empirical studies of the
flow of funds to managers who have achieved high relative performance in previous
periods. It is shown that these fund flows characterise the incentives that are faced
by fund managers. Those incentives are significantly different from the incentives
faced by private investors.
Finally, the effect of the differences in incentives for unexplained market phenomena
are discussed. The most important observation results from a thought experiment on
dynamic herding, namely, that when large changes in prices occur, fund managers
are all induced to trade in the same direction. Of course, the subsequent shift in price
arising from price pressure undoes the hedging effect for managers who had small
bets against the index and those managers meet some of the hedging demand.
Nonetheless, we should expect to see fund manager herding arising from dynamic
hedging of pay-offs that are different to those faced by private investors.
Two other interesting results then follow. Firstly, dynamic hedging may be a cause
of serial correlation in stock prices. Secondly, the provision of dynamic insurance by
private investors to institutional investors may partially explain the underperformance of fund managers. These three concepts will be the subject of hopefully
fruitful further research.

Chapter 3 Fund Manager Herding
3.1

Introduction

Why do we care whether fund managers ‘herd’ in their purchases and sales of
financial assets? A principal reason is that herding is evidence that institutional
investors behave differently from private investors. Previous empirical studies of
herding have sought to determine whether institutional investors, by trading in the
same direction at the same time, move asset prices away from ‘fundamental’ values.38
However, a separate motivation is that empirical findings of herding are evidence
that the market can be clustered into groups of investors which are delineated by
their different trading behaviour.39
Private investors and institutional investors seem to be two such distinct groups. A
simple example can illustrate one major difference between them - incentives.
Suppose a private investor and a fund manager each hold 4 percent of their
respective portfolios in a particular stock which realises a return of 150 percent over
a period. For the private investor the stock contributes a 6 percent increase to end of
period wealth, in direct proportion to the initial weight of the stock in the portfolio.
The effect of the stock return on the fund manager’s end of period wealth is more
complicated. Firstly, it will be non-linear in the excess-to-benchmark return of the
stock; because even though management fees generally increase linearly with the
size of the fund, there is a non-linear relationship between a fund’s excess-tobenchmark return and the flow of new money to the fund.40 Secondly, the scale of a
large fund can make the manager’s end of period wealth (or investment firm value)
highly sensitive to returns achieved.

The point of this example is that since institutional investors face fundamentally
different incentives from those of private investors they can be expected to behave
differently. It is surprising then that finance theory does not put more emphasis on
the existence of groups of investors that differ in their investment and trading
behaviour. Most portfolio management and investment theory assumes that the gain
to the representative investor is simply the increase in value of the portfolio held which implicitly assumes that the representative investor is not an institutional
investor. Consider, for example, the investor in the CAPM or the informed trader in
the Kyle model of market microstructure. Clearly neither are institutional investors
because their end of period wealth changes in direct proportion to the total return on
the financial assets held.41
To better comprehend the market equilibrium we need to know whether investors
can be clustered into groups (such as private investors and institutional investors) by
their trading behaviour. The manner in which such groups interact with each other
may be central to understanding phenomena such as: overshooting in asset prices; net
trade between groups arising from dynamic insurance of the different risks they face;
and differences in investment performance of the groups as a result of net trade and
aggregate provision of insurance. In this context the importance of herding studies is
that a test for herding by a group of investors constitutes a test of whether the group’s
trading behaviour is significantly different from that of the rest of the market42.
Herding by a group of investors is generally taken to mean that individual investors
do not act solely on the basis of their private information, but instead, give some
precedence in their decision-making to the decisions of other members of the group,
and consequently the members of the group act in concert. Empirical studies have
focused on herding among fund managers, rather than other groups of investors. The
characteristics of a group of investors that are identified by herding theory as causes
of herding, such as correlated information signals or relative performance evaluation,
are assumed in the existing literature to be found predominantly in institutional
41

Brennan (1993) addresses this issue in the CAPM framework.

42

Brown and Goetzmann (1997) form US mutual fund managers into ‘style’ groups by a method

which is analogous to k-means cluster analysis.

<-----Page 107----->108

investors rather than private investors. Moreover, as a practical matter little data is
available on the trading behaviour of other groups of investors.
The Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (LSV 1992b) measure of herding is based on
the degree to which investors in the group trade on the same side of the market, as
compared to that which would be expected by pure chance. LSV find weak evidence
of herding among US equity pension fund managers, with more herding in small
market capitalisation stocks43. Using the LSV measure, Grinblatt, Titman and
Wermers (GTW 1995) find stronger evidence of herding by US mutual fund
managers in stocks that are traded by large numbers of managers in a period.
Wermers (1999), using 20 years of US mutual fund data finds evidence of herding by
US mutual funds, but little variation in the herding level with the number of
managers trading the stock in a period. Choe, Kho and Stulz (1999) use the LSV
measure to study herding by foreign investors in the Korean equity market in 1997.
They find very large levels of herding for some subsets of the data.
Wermers (1995) develops a different measure of herding based on the correlation
between the portfolio weight changes of two randomly formed sub-groups of the
investors.

The Wermers measure applied to the GTW mutual fund data also

measures substantial levels of herding, which increases with the number of funds
trading. Kodres and Pritsker (1995) examine herding in the futures market and find
that institutions herd in their holdings of futures contracts, but the herding does not
explain a large part of the changes in their positions.

43

Empirical studies of the existence of fund manager herding began with the Friend, Blume and

Crockett (1970) study of mutual funds which found, for the brief period studied, that managers buy
stocks that were previously bought by successful managers. Kraus and Stoll (1972) examined the
monthly trades of 229 institutional investors between January 1968 and September 1969. They
reported large monthly net trade, in some stocks, between the group of institutional investors and the
rest of the market. Klemkosky (1977) examined the relationship between the net trades of a group of
large institutional investors and the returns of securities before and after the measured period. He
found evidence of herding by institutional investors that was consistent with ‘overshooting’ of stock
prices; the herding was manifested in net buying of stocks that had recently risen in price and net
selling of stocks that had recently peaked in price.

<-----Page 108----->109

The studies of LSV, GTW and Wermers suggest that herding measures can identify:
groups of investors whose trades are significantly correlated; the types of stocks in
which this herding occurs; and intertemporal effects such as feedback trading
(positive serial correlations in the portfolio weight changes of a single group) and
cascades (positive serial cross-correlations in portfolio weight changes between two
groups). Measures of herding appear to have a broad application in studies of the
dynamic equilibrium of the market. A clear finding of the empirical studies is that
groups of fund managers, particularly mutual fund managers, can be separated from
the rest of the market by their trading behaviour.
In order to obtain an expected value of zero in the absence of herding the LSV and
Wermers measures are constructed with strong implicit assumptions. However, as
shown in the next section some of these assumptions are not sustained in real
datasets. It is counterfactually assumed that all managers may short sell all stocks.
Further it is assumed that when a manager trades a certain stock in a period, the ex
ante probability of the manager buying rather than selling that stock is not dependent
on either the manager’s initial weight in the stock or the amount of new money that
the manager must invest during the period.
The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the empirical herding
literature is well founded by testing whether the principal measures of herding are
accurate.

That is, whether those measures find a statistically and economically

significant level of herding where no herding exists.

Or if herding does exist,

whether the measures substantially overstate the level of herding present.
Ideal data for a test of the accuracy of herding measures would be a large number of
independent datasets of trading decisions, drawn from a group of investors, that is
known to exhibit no herding. Applying the herding measure to each such dataset
would create an estimate of the sampling distribution of the herding measure under
conditions of zero herding. The herding measurements on the independent datasets
would allow estimates of, firstly, the probability of a false positive finding of
herding, and secondly, the expected value of the herding measure in the absence of
herding. A feasible alternative approach is to start with an actual dataset of the net

<-----Page 109----->110

trades of a group of investors, and from it, randomly create independent datasets
which exhibit approximately zero systematic herding.
In this study a dataset of the portfolio holdings of 268 UK equity unit trusts, in the
period January 1986 to December 1993, is employed to test the accuracy of the
herding measures of LSV and Wermers (1995). The required zero herding datasets
are formed by re-sampling from the actual dataset. The re-sampling techniques,
principally bootstrapping, are designed with the objective of maintaining in the new
datasets as much of the essential characteristics of the actual dataset as possible,
whilst still eliminating all systematic herding. To separate the effect of different
invalid assumptions on the accuracy of the herding measures, various re-sampling
techniques are implemented to produce datasets in which the different invalid
assumptions are relaxed.
The LSV measure is first applied to the actual dataset, without adjustment for
inaccuracy. A significant amount of herding is found which is increasing in the
number of funds that trade the stock during the period. The measured level of
herding is higher for the smallest and the largest market capitalisation stocks. For the
subset of the data where 20 or more managers traded the stock over the particular
period, the level of herding is commensurate with an average of between 13 and 14
of 20 managers trading on one side of the market.
The first accuracy test examines the effect of the invalid short sales assumption
which is implicit in the LSV measure. On 1,000 datasets, constructed to exhibit no
short selling and approximately zero systematic herding, the LSV measure finds an
average level of herding which is positive and large in certain categories of stocks.
That is, when short selling is ruled out the LSV measure is not calibrated to zero.
For stocks that lie, in market capitalisation, between the largest and smallest stocks,
much of the herding found can be attributed to the false LSV assumption that all fund
managers can sell stocks short. Moreover, about a third of the herding found in the
smallest market capitalisation stocks is attributable to the LSV short selling
assumption. Nonetheless, the herding levels found in the UK dataset exceed the 95th
percentile of the sampling distribution in every major subset of the dataset.

<-----Page 110----->111

The Wermers measure, when applied to the actual trading decisions of UK equity
mutual fund managers finds a surprisingly strong level of herding in some subsets of
the data. For example, when the funds are randomly divided into two groups and
formed into two value weighted portfolios, in the subset of the dataset where 15 or
more managers trade a stock during a period, the sample ‘correlation’ between
weight changes in the portfolios is 0.24.
The accuracy of the Wermers measure is similarly tested by transforming the data to
eliminate systematic herding. To test for the effect of mis-specification of the test for
correlation, bootstrap re-sampling of the portfolio weight changes in each
observation is undertaken. Results from 200 replications show that, for large stocks
and where more than 10 managers trade a stock in a period, the Wermers measure is
substantially biased towards finding herding and severely overstates the level of
herding in the actual dataset. Nonetheless, when the results of applying the Wermers
measure to the actual dataset are compared to the estimated zero herding sampling
distribution, the hypothesis of no herding among the UK equity unit trust managers is
again rejected.
With this study of herding among equity mutual fund managers in a large market
outside the US, the results of the empirical herding literature are made more general.
Herding is found where a large proportion of the managers trade a stock, and in their
trading of largest and smallest stocks. The foundation of the empirical herding
literature is strengthened because in this study the distribution of the herding
measures under the null assumption of no herding is estimated empirically rather
than simply assumed. Finally, the techniques developed here for re-sampling datasets
of trading decisions can easily be adapted to empirically estimate the sampling
distribution of other measures based upon portfolio holdings data, such as, measures
of fund manager performance, window dressing or performance persistence.

3.2

Types of herding

A natural approach to the analysis of herding is to begin with the individual
investors’ decisions to trade and then search for forces that align or polarise their
actions to create the aggregate effect of herding. Fund managers face a stochastic

<-----Page 111----->112

dynamic optimisation problem which we can assume for simplicity is solved once
every period.

The manager seeks to maximise an objective function, such as

expected utility of end of period wealth or the value of the investment management
firm, by choosing stocks from the choice set, subject to constraints such as no short
sales. The information set of the manager is processed to estimate the moments of
stock returns, which along with initial conditions are the input to the objective
function.
There are several explanations for the existence of fund manager herding, each of
which derive from a part of the manager’s optimisation problem.44 Firstly, relative
performance evaluation of managers causes the portfolio holdings of one manager to
enter the objective function of another manager, which in turn may lead to positive
correlation between the trades of managers. Scharfstein and Stein (1990) argue that
when the quality of managers’ decisions are assessed, then for the same payoff to the
principals, a consensus decision is taken to be a stronger signal of quality than a
contrarian decision. Maug and Naik (1996) show that a manager whose payoffs
depend on returns which are measured relative to the return on assets held by other
managers, may choose to ignore some private information and herd with the other
managers.
Secondly, positive correlation of the trading decisions of managers can arise from
overlap in their information sets. Models by Brennan (1990), Froot, Scharfstein,
Stein (1992) and Hirshleifer, Subrahmanyam and Titman (1994) recognise that when
valuing private information investors consider the probability that the information
will be incorporated into the price of the asset within their investment horizon. This
effect may lead managers to research the same stocks and therefore derive their
estimates of stock return moments from partially correlated private information sets.
Thirdly, managers may augment their information sets with inferences from the
trades of those other managers who are perceived to be informed. Bikhchandani,
Hirshleifer and Welch (1992) provide the seminal ideas for herding theories based on

44

Devenow and Welch (1996) comprehensively review herding theory and provide a similar

categorisation of herding theory.

<-----Page 112----->113

local conformity. Banerjee (1992) applies these ideas to explain herding as an
informational cascade. In addition, fund managers may take decisions on the basis of
the same public information. In particular, they may follow the same strategies
based on public information, such as momentum, contrarian or earnings surprise
strategies.
Mathematical definitions of herding implied by the herding theories are set out in
equations 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 below.

If herding arises from relative performance

evaluation then the portfolio weight changes of individual managers should be
positively correlated with the changes of the other managers after conditioning on
overlapping information sets.

In contrast, if herding arises from informational

cascade then positive conditional correlation should be found only between
individual managers and other managers that are perceived to be informed.

If

correlated information sets are the sole explanation of herding, then the portfolio
weight changes of individual managers should be unconditionally correlated with the
aggregate changes of the remaining managers but, after conditioning on the shared
information, the correlation should be zero.

There are, however, other means by which the trading of fund managers may become
correlated, which are apparent when herding is considered in a framework of the
portfolio choice problem of individual managers, but are not generally considered to
be herding. Firstly, changes in the opportunity set faced by managers can induce
them to trade in the same direction. Consider for example small stocks. Because
fund managers on average hold more than the market weight in larger stocks, as
small stocks get larger there is a net flow of these stocks from private investors to
institutional investors.45

These trades are clearly correlated across managers.

Another example is dividend yield. When the yield of a previously low yielding
stock rises sufficiently, the stock moves into the domain of income managers who
may then buy the stock in concert. Secondly, changes in the scale of the optimisation
problem faced by individual managers may lead to correlated trading.

Fund

managers who hold those stocks which realised high abnormal positive returns in the
previous period receive more of the new money in the current period, and therefore
have a liquidity need to buy. If these managers maintain their existing portfolio
weights by investing the new money in stocks that they already hold, then they will
on average trade in the same direction.46
Changes in the issued capital of a stock are another form of variation in the
managers’ opportunity set.

IPOs, seasoned equity issues, stock repurchases,

45

See Lakonishok, Shleifer, Thaler and Vishny (1991)

46

Wermers calls this a scale effect.

<-----Page 114----->115

delistings etc., generate positively correlated trading which is an illusion of herding.
Fortunately, in portfolio holdings data observations surrounding equity issues, stock
buy-backs, capital payouts and birth and death of stocks can be ignored, and the
effects of other capital changes can be routinely undone.
To summarise, correlated trading arising from the polarisation of the trading
decisions of individual managers may be of three types. Firstly, managers making
their decisions on the basis of other managers’ decisions because of relative
performance evaluation or informational cascade.

Secondly, positive correlation

between managers’ decisions as a result of overlapping private or public information
sets. These sources of correlated trading are considered to be herding because they
result from managers’ cognisance of the actions of other managers when making
their trading decisions. Finally, correlated trading arises from the market artefacts of
changes in the characteristics of stocks and changes of scale in the holdings of some
managers. These effects are not considered to be herding and must be controlled for
in accurate measures of herding.
From an experimenter’s perspective, a manager’s portfolio choice decision for each
stock, in each period, is the realisation of a stochastic process, the exact form of
which is unknown. Portfolio holdings datasets record these realisations in panels of
data, one for each date, which show how many shares in each stock were held by
each fund at that date. The task in measuring herding is to test for independence of
the trading decisions of managers whilst controlling for effects that are not herding,
and if independence is rejected, then to summarise the degree of joint dependence
between the trades of the managers in the group. The herding measure of LSV and
Wermers employ non parametric methods for this purpose.

3.3

The LSV herding measure

LSV simplify the task by transforming the managers’ portfolio choice decision for a
stock to an ordered categorical variable, which takes one of three outcomes; either
buy, hold or sell. The basic unit of data is a stock-period-manager observation,
denoted here by xitj, which records whether stock i, in period t, was either bought,
held or sold by manager j. From the experimenter’s perspective, the probability

<-----Page 115----->116

distribution of this trichotomous variable may be conditioned by several other
variables, including: the manager’s information set; the observed trading decisions of
other managers; the manager’s initial holding in the stock; and the amount of new
money that the manager must invest.
LSV consider only those observations where the outcome is a buy or a sell. This
conditioning on the occurrence of a trade reduces the observed trading direction to
the outcome of a Bernoulli trial. LSV further assume that Prob(Xitj = buy  Xitj = buy
or Xitj = sell), denoted here by pitj, is a constant, pt, for any random variable xitj in
period t. That is, conditional on a trade occurring, the probability that the outcome is
a buy (the propensity to buy) is the same for the trading of all managers, in all stocks,
in any one period. It is further assumed that, in the absence of herding, each of the
Bernoulli trials is independent of all other trials. Under these assumptions, if nit is
the number of managers who trade stock i in period t, and bit is the number of
managers who buy the stock, then bit is the outcome of a random draw from a
binomial distribution with probability parameter pt and dimension nit.
The LSV test of herding rests upon the following proposition. In the absence of
herding the expected number of managers who buy a stock in a period, as a
proportion of those who trade that stock, has the same value, pt, for all stocks. If
significant cross sectional variation in this proportion is found, then the null of no
herding can be rejected. The herding in stock i, in period t, is measured as follows.

ρt

is the sample estimate of the probability parameter pt, where ρt = Σibit/Σinit.

<-----Page 116----->117

The value  bit/nit - ρt  is the magnitude of the difference between the observed ratio
of buys to trades and the expected value of that ratio under the null of no herding.
This magnitude will be large if the trading of managers is polarised in the direction
of either buying or selling. The estimated variance of the herding statistic in one
stock-period, VarHit, is easily calculated from the values of bit , nit and ρt. The
overall herding statistic Hlsv is simply the average of the herding statistic over all
stock-periods of interest.

The several different sources of herding predicted by herding theory are captured by
this measure. If relative performance evaluation or informational cascade induce
positive correlation between the trades of the managers, then the variance of bit is
greater than the null condition variance of nit pt (1-pt). Otherwise, if the information
sets of individual managers are correlated, then the expected value of bit is

<-----Page 117----->118

conditioned on that information.47

In each case unexpectedly large numbers of

managers trading in one direction will be found.
However, the LSV measure should be expected to find herding where none exists for
two reasons. Firstly, Hit is calculated using the sample quantity ρt rather than its
population counterpart pt. Therefore, Ε[Hit] is not zero, which means that the CLT is
not applicable. Moreover, because of the absolute value operation, both positive and
negative values of (ρt - pt) can lead to positive bias in Hit; meaning that the
estimation error need not go to zero as we average Hit across stocks and dates.
Secondly, the LSV measure starts with the observations where a trade is known to
have occurred and the random outcome of interest is whether the manager bought or
alternatively sold the stock in the period. But the beginning of period holding in the
stock is also known. Therefore, it is implicitly assumed that all managers can short
sell all stocks because otherwise in those observations where the initial holding is
zero, the manager’s decision is not a random outcome it must be a buy.48
The short sales constraint restricts the number of ‘sell’ occurrences in a stock-period
to be no more than the number of managers who initially hold the stock. In terms of
the distribution of bit, the short sales constraint imposes a left truncation. In contrast,
the LSV measure is calculated assuming a binomial distribution of bit. Therefore, on
real datasets drawn from groups of managers, few if any of whom can undertake
short sales, the expected value of the LSV measure need no longer be zero. If none
of the managers who trade in a stock-period initially hold the stock then all the trades
must be buys, so the measure must return a non-negative value. However, in other
cases where some managers have positive initial holdings, the short sales constraint
can lead to an expected value of the LSV measure which is negative in the absence
of herding, because the truncation reduces the overall probability mass in the tails of
the distribution of bit.
47

Changes in the characteristics of stocks, such as the transition of small stocks to large stocks are

likewise manifested as changes in the expected value of bit.
48

UK unit trust managers are prohibited from undertaking short sales. US mutual fund managers may

only undertake short sales if such trades are foreshadowed in the fund prospectus.

<-----Page 118----->119

Two other reasons that the distribution of bit does not have the assumed binomial
distribution, even in the absence of herding, are apparent. Managers whose weight in
a stock is already comparatively large at the beginning of the period are more likely
to sell than other managers, because of mean reversion in portfolio weights. Further,
empirical studies show that mutual fund managers who have recent high performance
relative to their peers receive more of the new money to manage, as discussed at
length in section 2.3. They therefore have a higher propensity to buy stocks than
poor performing managers. We might therefore expect that pitj, the probability that
manager j buys rather than sells stock i in period t, is conditioned by both the size of
the manager’s initial holding in the stock and the manager’s liquidity need to buy
stocks. Tests of the dataset strongly reject a hypothesis of no variation in pitj by
manager or initial holding.49
When the propensity to buy varies by initial holding and/or across managers, bit is no
longer binomially distributed. The distribution of bit is not centred on pt, making
extreme values more likely, but the variance of the distribution may be larger or
smaller than in the assumed binomial distribution. The direction and size of a bias,
induced by the assumptions on short selling and the variation in pitj by manager and
initial holding, is an empirical question.

The question can be addressed by

lsv

under the null hypothesis of no herding

estimating the sampling distribution of H
with the invalid assumptions relaxed.

49

To test for variation in pt across managers, the value of pt is estimated for each manager in each

period covered by the dataset (the dataset is described in chapter 4). The null hypothesis that pt is the
same for all managers at any particular date is rejected at the 95 percent significance level in all but
two of 90 periods. To test for variation in pt by the initial holding of managers, stock-period-manager
observations for which the initial holding of the stock is positive are grouped by stock-periods. For
each such group, the observations are formed into quintiles by the initial weight of the stock in the
manager’s portfolio. Retaining the quintile marker, the full set of observations are regrouped into the
90 reporting periods and the value of pt is calculated for each quintile in each period. The null
hypothesis of no variation in pt by initial holding in the stock is rejected at the 95 percent significance
level in all 90 periods.

<-----Page 119----->120

3.4

Wermers herding measure

Wermers (1995) develops a herding measure which is based on the following idea.
If a group of investors are randomly divided into two subgroups, then in the absence
of herding the aggregate changes in portfolio weights of the two subgroups have zero
correlation in each period. Wermers randomly divides the fund managers in the
dataset into two groups, A and B.50 The value-weighted vector of portfolio weights
of each group is formed for each of the T+1 reporting dates. These vectors are then
differenced to give T vectors of portfolio weight change for each group.

The

Wermers measure of herding is the average over the T periods of the sample
correlation of portfolio weight changes of the two groups.
There is a powerful geometric intuition for the measure. Starting with group A, the
vector of portfolio weights at any time t is a point in the n dimensional asset space,
on the unit simplex. There are T such points mapping out the path taken by group A
over time. The vector between any two sequential points is the portfolio change
vector for that period. The same is true for group B. Under the null of no herding
the direction of the portfolio change vectors of groups A and B should be unrelated.
It follows that the cosine of the angle between the portfolio change vectors of the two
groups in any period should have an expected value of zero. Essentially, Wermers
estimates the cosine of these angles and compares their average to zero. This idea is
expressed in equation 3.7, where the change in stock i’s weight in group j, in period
t, is ∆witj.

T is the number of periods.51

It is assumed by Wermers that the

unconditional expectation of all portfolio weight changes is zero.

50

Wermers uses stratified random sampling to divide the two groups, controlling for families of funds

and the investment objective.
51

I simply average the cosines as in equation 4.

Wermers, however, prefers to average the

denominator terms and then apply this average as the scaling factor for all periods (with the stated
intention of reducing the standard error of the estimate), as shown in equation 4a.

Wermers shows the conditions under which this measure is equivalent to the LSV
measure. Consequently, as with the LSV measure, the accuracy of the Wermers
measure may rely upon assumptions that are not sustained in real datasets. A study
of the accuracy of the measure by analytical derivation of the mean of the sampling
distribution under various assumptions is infeasible for several reasons.

Most

importantly, the portfolio weight change observations (∆witA,∆witB) are drawn from
probability distributions the form of which are unknown and not easily modelled.
However, it is clear that these distributions are conditioned by characteristics of the
stock, including size, and by the beginning of period holding of each group in the
stock.52 The distributions also exhibit data truncation because of the omission of
observations where one or both of the groups do not trade the stock during the
period. If short sales are prohibited then the distribution from which the portfolio
weight changes are drawn are left censored. Geometrically, the short sales constraint
confines the portfolio weight vectors to the first quadrant of the asset space.

It is standard practice to average ratios in empirical work to reduce the effect of outliers. However, in
this case the cosine terms which are averaged in equation 4 can only range from -1 to +1. There are
good reasons for choosing equation 4 rather than equation 4a as the measure. Firstly, equation 4
retains the useful intuition of a null where the cosine of the angle between the portfolio changes is on
average zero.

Secondly, in equation 4a the terms in the time series average are clearly not

independent because they share the same denominator, so straight-forward hypothesis testing based on
t-values calculated from time series standard errors is not appropriate. Therefore, in this paper the
Wermers measure is calculated as per equation 4.
52

Tests for cross-sectional heteroscedasticity in the portfolio weight changes rejected the null of

homoscedasticity in all periods for both groups A and B. Further, in regressions of the portfolio
weight changes of group A on the portfolio weight changes of group B and the initial holding of group
A, the co-efficient on the initial holding of group A is significant at the 1 percent level.

<-----Page 121----->122

Another potential problem is the use of average prices in calculating portfolio
weights. Portfolio weight changes over a period result from both changes in the
number of shares held in each stock, as desired, but also from changes in prices.
Changes in the price vector shift the portfolio weight vectors of groups A and B and
also the market portfolio in related directions; which may create an illusion of
herding. To mitigate this problem Wermers uses the same price vector to calculate
both the beginning and end of period portfolio weight vectors. Mid-prices, the
simple average of beginning and end of period prices, are chosen for this purpose –
but other choices would be equally valid. However, it is not possible to cleanly
separate quantity and price effects in weight changes derived from portfolio holdings
that are recorded at discrete time points. Changes in the price vector will induce
changes in portfolio holdings vectors of both groups, which may be correlated.
Therefore, the use of mid-prices may lead to a positive mean for the Wermers
measure in the absence of herding.
The inaccuracy in the Wermers measure arising from mis-specification of the
measure of correlation, and from the use of mid-prices can be determined empirically
by estimating the sampling distribution of the measure on datasets that are
constructed to exhibit zero systematic herding.

3.5

Concluding remarks

A test for herding by a group of investors amounts to a test of whether that group can
be differentiated from the rest of the market by it’s trading behaviour. The herding
measures of LSV and Wermers can capture the correlated trading of fund managers
that is postulated by the three principal theoretical explanations of the existence of
herding; which are, relative performance evaluation, informational cascade; and
correlated information theories.
It is argued in this chapter that invalid assumptions in LSV and Wermers measures
may significantly bias the measures toward finding herding where no herding exists.
The LSV and Wermers measures may also record correlated trading that is not
considered herding, such as, fund managers with new money scaling up their

<-----Page 122----->123

portfolios, or correlated trading arising from changing characteristics of stocks (small
stocks becoming large stocks, for instance).
The next chapter employs the LSV and Wermers measures to test for herding among
a group of UK unit trust managers and conducts tests of the effects of the invalid
assumptions on the accuracy of these measures.

Chapter 4 Tests of the Accuracy of Herding Measures
4.1

Introduction

This is the second of two chapters which comprise the essay on tests of the accuracy
of herding measures using UK data. Chapter 3 motivated the study of herding
among UK unit trust managers as a test of whether those managers can be delineated
from the rest of the UK equity market on the basis of their behaviour in trading UK
equities.
This chapter fulfils three of the four purposes of this study. Firstly, to develop a
methodology for testing the accuracy of metrics which are based on portfolio
holdings data.

Secondly, to apply the bootstrapping methodology to test the

accuracy of existing herding measures. Thirdly, to apply the herding measures,
suitably adjusted for estimated bias, to data drawn from a country which has an
investment management industry comparable to that of the US; thereby, extending
the generality of empirical herding results.

4.2

Data

The primary data for this study is a record of the portfolio holdings of 268 UK equity
mutual funds, as contained in semi-annual reports to investors over the period
January 31, 1986 to December 31, 1993.53 For a fund to be classified as an UK
equity mutual fund it must have more than 90 percent of its holdings in stocks listed
on the London Stock Exchange. All other data required for the study, including
prices, market-values and capital changes are taken from the London Business
School’s London Share Price Database (LSPD). Dimson and Marsh (1983) provides
a detailed description of the LSPD.

53

The portfolio holdings data for this study was provided by John Morrell and Associates of London.

<-----Page 124----->125

The dataset contains semester data, meaning that for each full year during which a
fund appears in the dataset, two snapshots of portfolio holdings are recorded. UK
fund managers choose the two calendar months in which they report to their
investors each year, and so they declare their portfolio holdings on either a January July cycle or a February - August cycle, etc. Each fund manager falls into one of six
reporting cycles and these cycles overlap. The 268 funds (that is, 268 managers) are
managed by 99 separate investment management firms. The average size of each
fund is £93 million. Tables 4.1 to 4.6, at the end of this section, provide a further
description of the data.
The basic unit of variation in this study is a manager’s holding in a particular stock
on a particular date. The dataset is composed of 96 panels of data, being one for
each month between January 1986 and December 1993 inclusive. These panels
record 237,185 non-zero portfolio entries across all stocks, periods and managers.
Of those records, 685 could not be matched to the LSPD dataset and were
consequently excluded. There were 3,469 ‘cash’ records which were deleted. The
95 records of stocks holdings of less than 100 shares were deleted because they were
unlikely to help extend our understanding of herding by UK fund managers. Then
2,151 occurrences, of a single stock appearing more than once in a single portfolio,
were consolidated into a single holding.
Next, the portfolios of each manager at sequential dates were differenced to
determine whether a particular stock was bought (from an initial holding of zero),
increased (from a positive initial holding), held, decreased or sold (leaving a holding
of zero). In this process of determining the direction of trades, the dataset has been
adjusted to ensure that basic changes to the opportunity set of fund managers,
resulting from capital changes of stocks, are not measured as herding. The effects of
stock splits and scrip issues on prices and number of shares held are reversed using
weights that are calculated for this purpose in the LSPD. Stock-periods that coincide
with equity issues, stock buy-backs or capital payouts are deleted. There were
14,741 such occurrences. Finally, stock-periods that cover a period that begins or
ends within six months of the birth or death of a stock are also removed. There were
10,708 such occurrences. What remains are 234,689 records comprised of 41,774
buys, 42,774 increases, 78,369 holds, 32,982 decreases, and 39,287 sells. These

<-----Page 125----->126

figures do not include the observations of a manager beginning and ending a period
with a zero holding in a stock – the vast majority of observations.
The dataset includes UK equity mutual funds that existed in December 1992. It is
conceivable that studying only the survivors creates an illusion of herding because
the survivors are more likely to have avoided strategies that led to termination or
merger of other funds. With a dataset of portfolio holdings of 274 US equity mutual
funds over a 10 year period, Wermers finds that the herding results are much the
same whether or not the dataset includes only funds that survived the entire period.
It therefore appears that survivorship bias is not an important issue in studies of
herding by mutual fund managers.
Empirical tests of herding require data on the purchases and sales of financial assets
by fund managers.

Unfortunately, large datasets on the transactions of fund

managers are not readily available. Instead the beginning and end of period holdings
of mutual fund managers are differenced to reveal the net transactions over each
period. The net transactions proxy for the actual transactions. Obviously if a trade is
partially or wholly reversed within the reporting period then the complete transaction
is not captured.

Table 4.2 shows that the total value of the stocks held by the unit trusts recorded in
the dataset increased by over a factor of four from the first to the last date. Table 2.3
of chapter 2 shows the total market value of UK equities held by all UK unit trusts at
year end in the period 1967 to 1997. At year end 1985 the UK unit trusts held £11
billion pounds in UK equities and at year end 1993 the figure was £50 billion. The
corresponding figures for the dataset are £6.5 billion and £28 billion. Hence the
dataset is representative of UK equity unit trusts in that it records more than half of
the UK equities held by UK unit trusts in the period January 1986 to Dec 1993.
Moreover, there are unit trusts that hold UK equities but have less than 90 percent of
their assets in UK equities and are therefore not classified as UK equity unit trusts.

Table 4.5 shows the average number of buy and sell occurrences for portfolios in the
different sectors for the even years in the dataset. There is not much variation year to
year in the total number of trades. However, the tables show more trades in the
second half of each of the years than in the first half. There is also some variation
across the sectors with more trades in the General sector portfolios, which may
reflect the larger size of those portfolios and the larger number of stocks held by
them.

*The first decile contains the 10 largest stocks. Otherwise the cut off for decile n is calculated as
10(S/10)(n-1)/9 where S is the total number of stocks listed at that date.

Table 4.6 reports descriptive statistics for the size deciles that are employed in the
accuracy tests of the LSV herding measure. The table entries demonstrate that the
market value of UK listed stocks is heavily concentrated in the very largest stocks.
For this reason the deciles are formed on the basis of the log of the size rank rather
than a more conventional division into 10 groups with an equal number of stocks.
The number of stocks in each of the log deciles is fairly stable over the period of the
dataset.

<-----Page 132----->133

4.3

Methodology

4.3.1 Test of the short selling assumption in the LSV measure
It is argued in chapter 3 that the LSV measure of herding may be significantly biased
in measuring herding among managers that face a short selling constraint; returning
positive herding values where no herding exists. Moreover, the sampling distribution
of the herding measure under the null condition of no herding is not analytically
tractable. An alternative is to empirically estimate a sampling distribution of the
LSV herding measure on the trading of the managers of interest under the null
condition.
The required sampling distribution, under the null of no herding, can be
approximated by a re-sampling approach. An ideal re-sampling method would have
the following properties. Firstly, it would deduce the exact trinomial distribution
from which each stock-period-manager observation was drawn, under conditions of
no herding. Then zero herding datasets would be re-sampled and measured by the
LSV measure to form a sampling distribution which is arbitrarily close to its
asymptotic form.
There are three impediments to obtaining this ideal. Firstly, and most importantly,
we cannot be sure that the re-sampled datasets are completely free of systematic
herding.

Some systematic herding may survive the process of estimating the

trinomial distributions and re-sampling from them. Secondly, with a finite dataset
the estimated trinomials will not capture all of the distinguishing characteristics of
the managers and stocks of interest. Therefore, when comparing the LSV results on
the actual dataset to the estimated zero herding sampling distribution, to some
(unknown) extent, we are not comparing apples with apples. Finally, there is resampling error which is decreasing in the number of re-sampled datasets (1,000 in
this case).
What is proposed here is a general test of the LSV measure, using an approximation
of the zero herding sampling distribution. When comparing the LSV test results to
the estimated sampling distribution, the shortcomings of the process by which the
sampling distribution was estimated must be considered. Nonetheless, there are

<-----Page 133----->134

specific reasons to think that the LSV measure is biased and the re-sampling
procedure that is presented here is designed to highlight the effects of those
problems. The problems relate to specific assumptions; that managers can short sell
and that the propensity to buy is not conditioned by a manager’s initial holding of the
stock. To highlight the effect of those invalid assumptions the zero herding resampling distribution is estimated with and without those assumptions in place. In
this way some control is imposed to arrive at an estimate of the effect of the invalid
assumptions.
The two principal requirements of the re-sampling procedure are, firstly, that herding
is eliminated, and secondly, that the re-sampling preserves the essential
characteristics of the actual dataset that are not associated with herding. Starting
with the herding elimination requirement, there are two sources of herding to
eliminate – unconditional correlation between managers’ trades and conditional
correlation.
Managers’ trades may be correlated because of correlated signals regarding future
stock values, or because of a scale effect (managers with new money replicating
existing portfolios) or because of changing stock characteristics (small stocks getting
bigger) or other information that conditions the trinomials from which the managers’
trade directions are drawn.

This correlation is unconditional because after

conditioning on this information (the correlated signals about future returns, or the
identity of the managers with new money, or the identity of stocks with changing
characteristics) the correlation is zero. Conditional correlation exists even after
conditioning on those three sources of conditioning information.

Conditional

correlation may arise from comparative performance evaluation or informational
cascade.
Both sources of correlation must be eliminated by the re-sampling procedure. We
can be confident that conditional correlation will be eliminated by the independence
of the draws in the re-sampling. Unconditional correlation is more problematic.
The basic unit of data to be re-sampled is the trade direction, Xitj ∈ {buy, sell, hold},
of a stock i, during period t, by manager j.

Each such stock-period-manager

<-----Page 134----->135

observation is replaced by a draw from an estimate of the probability distribution,
Pitj(xitj) that would prevail in the absence of herding. The trinomial distributions are
estimated by forming the buy/hold/sell observations of the actual dataset into groups
and taking the proportion of buy observations as the probability of a buy, and
likewise for hold and sell probabilities.

This process will only eliminate

unconditional correlation if the conditioning information averages (integrates) to an
expected value of zero over all observations in the group. It is therefore crucial that
criteria used to form groups (dates, stock size, initial holding levels) not be correlated
with conditioning information that is associated with herding.

This concept is

revisited in the results section.
The purpose of grouping the observations before estimating the trinomials is to
preserve essential characteristics and to relax the invalid assumptions. In the test of
the short selling assumption three levels of grouping are imposed. Firstly, the data is
divided into the 15 six month periods within which each trust reports its holdings
once. The first period is 31 January 1986 to 30 June 1986, the next is 31 July 1986
to 31 December 1986, and so on. The next criteria is size. In each period the stocks
are divided into size deciles. The market value of UK stocks is heavily concentrated
in the largest stocks and the number of trades is commensurately larger in those
stocks. To even out the number of observations across groups, the size deciles are
formed by the log of the size rank of the stock, with the requirement that the first
decile include the 10 largest stocks.

The cut-off for the other nine deciles is

10(S/10)(n-1)/9 where n is the decile and S is the total number of stocks listed at that
date.
The period and size criteria generate 150 groups. These criteria are intended to
preserve characteristics of the actual dataset that are not associated with herding.
The third criteria is that all stocks that have an initial holding of zero are placed in a
separate group. The trinomials estimated from the zero-initial-holding groups have
an estimated probability of ‘sell’ observations that is zero by construction. Thus
relaxing the invalid assumption that all managers undertake short selling. The zero
herding sampling distribution is estimated with and without this third grouping into
positive and zero initial holdings. This control of the presence of the assumption

<-----Page 135----->136

permits an estimate of the effect of the short selling assumption on the accuracy of
the LSV herding measure.

4.3.2 Test of the invariance assumption in the LSV measure
It is explicitly assumed in the construction of the LSV measure that in the absence of
herding the propensity of managers to buy rather than sell, denoted pitj, is invariant
across stocks and managers in any one period. The propensity to buy is defined as
pitj = Pitj(Xitj = buy)/[Pitj(Xitj = buy) + Pitj(Xitj = sell)]. Chi square tests of invariance of
the propensity to buy strongly reject the assumptions that pitj does not vary with a
manager’s initial holding in a stock or, separately, the identity of the manager.
The effect of variation in pitj with a manager’s initial holding in a stock is tested here.
It is reasonable to assume that there is mean reversion in the portfolio holdings
weights of managers. We might expect that managers with high initial holdings have
lower propensities to buy than managers with lower initial holdings of the stock.
When the propensity to buy varies by initial holding, bit is no longer binomially
distributed. The mean and the variance of the distribution of bit is affected by the
variation in propensity to buy. Whether extreme values of bit/nit are made more
rather than less likely by variation in managers’ initial holdings in a stock is an
empirical question.
The effect of the invariance assumption is tested by imposing another level of
grouping to include the initial holding level. In each stock-period the non-zero initial
holdings of the stock are ranked and formed into quintiles. If the number of initial
holdings that is positive is less than 5 then all non-zero holdings in that stock period
are assigned to the middle quintile. Each period/size group is then divided into six
groups. One for zero initial holdings and five for the initial holding quintiles. As
before, trinomials are estimated for each group and the trade direction of the stockperiod-manager combinations that comprise the group are redrawn from that group’s
estimated trinomial.
The effect of variation in pitj by manager identity is not measured here. The effect
could be incorporated by estimating a trinomial distribution for each individual
observation within a group. This can be achieved by fitting a probit estimation to the

<-----Page 136----->137

categorical observations of buys, holds and sells within the group. When this was
done, the dummy variables for many of the managers were found to be highly
insignificant, thus calling into question the validity of the estimation. Omitting some
but not all of the managers is unsatisfactorily arbitrary. The effect of variation in pitj
by manager is likely to be qualitatively similar to the effect of variation by initial
holding. Therefore, variation by manager was not tested, and grouping rather than
probit estimation was employed to estimate the effect of variation in pitj by initial
holding.

4.3.3 Bootstrapping test of the Wermers measure
The probability distribution of a manager’s change in a stock’s portfolio weight
during a period is conditional on the manager’s initial holding in the stock. The most
extreme case is where the manager has no initial holding in a particular stock and
short sales are prohibited; in which case negative changes in portfolio weight have
zero probability.

However, the Wermers measure of correlation between the

portfolio weight changes of two groups of managers has no sample mean term.
Therefore, the measure need not have an expected value of zero in the absence of
herding. To determine whether the short sales constraint results in a significant bias
in the Wermers measure we require an estimate of the sampling distribution of the
measure on a dataset which is constructed to have no systematic herding, which
maintains the essential characteristics of the actual dataset, and for which the short
sales constraint prevails. Again, the sampling distribution is created by a cycle of
transforming the dataset by bootstrap re-sampling and then applying the herding
measure, in this case the Wermers measure.
In the Wermers measure the basic unit of data, denoted ∆witj, is the change in
portfolio weight in stock i of manager j during a period t (a stock-period-manager
observation).

To transform the dataset, the portfolio weight change of each

observation is replaced by a random draw from an empirical estimate of its
probability distribution Pitj(∆witj). To estimate Pitj(∆witj) the set of stock-periodmanager observations which contain a stock among the 2,000 largest stocks at the
beginning of the period, is first divided into 146 groups by the market capitalisation
of the stock. Firstly, each observation is allocated a rank on the basis of the size of

<-----Page 137----->138

the stock at the beginning to the period, with the largest stock allocated a rank of 1
and the smallest of the stocks considered, a rank of 2,000. The observations which at
the beginning of the period contained one of the 20 largest stocks are formed into 20
groups by their rank. The next 180 largest stocks are divided into 36 groups - five
ranks per group. The next 1,800 largest stocks are divided into 90 groups - 20 ranks
per group. Each of these 146 groups are then divided into two groups by whether the
holding of the stock is positive or zero at the beginning of the period.
To randomly transform the dataset, the portfolio weight change in each observation
is replaced by the portfolio weight change of an observation drawn randomly, with
replacement, from the same group of observations. This replacement procedure
constitutes a draw from the estimate of the probability distribution of the portfolio
weight change after conditioning on stock size and whether the initial holding is
positive.
As discussed in the previous section, the conditional correlation between the
portfolio weight changes of managers is eliminated by the independence of the
draws. The unconditional correlation is eliminated in estimating Pitj(∆witj) if the
conditioning information regarding correlated signals on future stock returns, stock
characteristic changes and manager performance is averaged to zero across the
observations in each group. In that case any measured correlation arises either from
chance or from features of the herding measure itself; in particular, mis-specification
of the test and/or use of average prices to calculate portfolio weights.
The empirical estimate of the sampling distribution of the Wermers herding measure
is constructed by undertaking 200 repetitions of the cycle of transformation and
measurement. The bootstrapping literature provides little guidance on the minimum
number of replications for adequate estimates of the sampling distribution. However,
200 or more replications is generally considered adequate for an estimate of the
standard error of the sampling distribution.54 Because the Wermers measure is the
average of 90 sample correlations we can rely on the central limit theorem to ensure
that the sampling distribution is approximately normal.

4.3.4 Re-ordering test of the Wermers measure
The bootstrapping test of the Wermers measure does not tell us whether any bias that
is found results from mis-specification, as opposed to the use of mid-prices, in
calculating portfolio weights. To separate the effects, a transformation is undertaken
which accentuates the effect of using mid-prices and attenuates other sources of bias.
In each stock-period-manager observation the stock identity is replaced with that of
another stock which is drawn, without replacement, from a stock in the same size
group of 10 stocks, where size is the market capitalisation of the stock at the
beginning of the particular period. This transformation involves rearrangement of
the data rather than re-sampling. Thinking of the data in terms of stock-periods, the
transformation takes 10 stocks in one period where the stocks are adjacent in size
ranking, and then for any one manager the 10 observations in those stocks are
transformed by randomly swapping the stock identities between the observations.
This transformation is an averaging process which reduces the occurrence of highly
polarised trading by the managers in those stock-periods. In that way any effect from
conditioning of the probability distribution of portfolio changes is attenuated and the
effect of changes in prices (rather than weights) is accentuated. Again, an estimate
of the sampling distribution of the measure under these conditions is created by
repeated re-ordering and application of the Wermers measure to the re-ordered
dataset.

4.4

LSV measure applied to the UK dataset

Table 4.7 reports the results of applying the LSV herding measure to the dataset of
268 UK equity mutual fund managers. Results are reported for the entire dataset,
and subsets of the observations formed on the basis of the number of managers who
trade in a stock-period and the market capitalisation rank of the stock (where the
largest stock at the beginning of the period has a rank equal to 1). For comparison,
results are also reproduced from the LSV (1992b) and Wermers (1999) studies of US
pension funds and US mutual funds respectively.
For the entire UK dataset the level of herding is 2.6 percent. The herding figure rises
with the number of managers trading to 6.9 percent when 20 or more managers trade

<-----Page 139----->140

the stock in a period. These results suggest that whatever causes a large proportion
of managers to trade also causes them to herd. The average, over all periods in the
dataset, of the propensity to buy (pt) is 0.58, reflecting the strong flow of money into
the funds over the period. When pt = 0.58 and the number of managers trading is 20,
a herding figure of 6.9 percent or more arises if 14 or more managers buy or 12 or
more managers sell. Where more than 10 managers trade a stock in a period, the
level of herding found in the UK dataset is 3.3 percent. Wermers finds a figure of
3.6 percent for the equivalent stock-periods in the US mutual fund dataset. The level
of herding in UK unit trusts is similar to that found in US mutual funds by Wermers.
This finding broadens the generality of previous results on herding in mutual funds.55
For herding to be a fund manager driven phenomenon, the polarising forces that
align the trades of a group of fund managers must act more strongly upon those
managers than other investors, so that the rest of the market (and prices) react to the
fund managers’ behaviour. The trading pressure created by the manag
demand can be equilibrated by trade with the rest of the market and/or price changes
that reduce the managers’ net trading demand. If the funds managed by the group of
managers is a small part of the total market then prices may change little. Otherwise,
if the group of managers forms a large component of the total market then the
polarised demand of fund managers may be resolved largely by price changes.
Price changes resulting from the aggregate demand of managers reduce the forces
that polarise the managers’ demand, creating a negative feedback effect.56 For this
reason it would be surprising if we were to find a large degree of fund manager
herding where fund managers are a large part of the market (as is the case in the
UK). Given a negative feedback effect of price changes, the herding figure of 6.9

55

The comparison between the UK and US results is not direct. The number of managers reporting

per period is greater in the studies on US data, the reporting by US fund managers is quarterly and the
UK stock market is more concentrated in the largest stocks.
56

If herding arises because one manager undertakes a large trade and other managers are counter

parties to it, then herding could exist with no net trade between the managers and the rest of the
market. However, in the UK dataset there are few occurrences of managers herding in one direction
and their net trade being in the other direction.

<-----Page 140----->141

percent is surprisingly large. Moreover, since it may be impossible to separate price
changes resulting from the polarising forces acting on managers from other causes of
price changes, the importance of studying these forces in terms of correlated trading
is apparent.
Table 4.7 shows that the highest levels of herding are found in the largest stocks and
the smallest stocks. Amongst the five largest stocks by market capitalisation the
level of herding is 4.1 percent. Amongst stocks outside the 1,000 largest, the level of
herding found is 6.2 percent. LSV in studying US pension fund managers’ trades
find a level of herding of 6.1 percent among the quintile of smallest stocks. Wermers
finds a figure of 6.2 percent for the quintile of smallest stocks amongst stocks that
are traded by 5 or more US fund managers in a period. LSV and Wermers do not
find that herding is increasing with market capitalisation of stocks. However, they
do not break down the largest quintile of US listed equities to see whether the
herding is increasing among the very largest stocks.
If herding results from relative performance evaluation, then managers should be
mostly concerned about the trades of other managers in large stocks which have the
most weight in the performance benchmark (unless they are small cap managers).
Further, if herding is explained by managers acting on shared information then we
might again expect more herding in larger stocks, because large stocks are followed
by more analysts and there is more information on large stocks in the public domain.
However, there is little in the theoretical explanations of herding that predicts high
levels of herding among the smallest stocks by market capitalisation.
Table 4.8 reports the results of testing for herding among managers with the same
investment management objective. Herding is low in these categories for stockperiods where a small number of funds trade. In the UK data, when the number of
managers trading is 10 or more, the herding in the investment categories is higher
than the overall level of herding. The UK results are consistent with the hypothesis
that relative performance evaluation causes herding, so that managers who are
measured against the same investment category benchmarks herd more strongly with
each other than with other managers. However, an alternative explanation is that the
managers with the same investment management objective are simply reacting at the

<-----Page 141----->142

same time to changing characteristics of stocks, such as price earnings ratio or book
to market ratio.
The stock-periods can be divided on the basis of buy or sell herding. Buy herding
stock-periods are those where (b/n-pt)>0, and likewise sell stock-periods are those
where (b/n-pt)<0. These results indicate that over the whole dataset, most of herding
is on the buy side. That is, most of the herding is managers herding into stocks rather
than out of them. Moreover, this is particularly true of smaller stocks. For stocks
outside the 100 largest, the aggregate level of herding is 2.7 percent, which is much
the same as the 2.6 percent level of the whole dataset. However, that 2.7 percent
breaks down as 5.2 percent on the buy side and only 0.7 percent on the sell side.
This dichotomy is even more acute amongst the smallest stocks. For stocks outside
the 1,000 largest the buy side herding is 12.1 percent and sell side is 1.2 percent. For
the largest stocks and stocks where a large number of managers trade in a period the
difference between buy-side and sell-side herding levels is much smaller.
These results suggest that managers herd when buying into small stocks or increasing
their holdings of these stocks but then reduce their holdings with less conformity. It
is also consistent with a spurious finding of herding arising from the scale effect,
although it seems unlikely that a scale effect creates the stark difference in buy and
sell herding among the smallest stocks. Amongst the smallest stocks Wermers finds
a different result. His finding of 6.2 percent herding among the smallest quintile of
stocks breaks down to 3.7 percent on the buy side and 8.1 percent on the sell side.
The results of tables 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9 indicate that herding is episodic in that it is
strongly increasing in the number of managers trading. This suggests that herding is
caused by shared information since the arrival of information is also intermittent. In
contrast, comparative performance appraisal is ever present. Herding by UK unit
trust managers is higher in the extremes of market capitalisation, but relatively
constant otherwise.
When interpreting results of the LSV measure across subsets where different
numbers of managers trade we should note that the measure is intrinsically
dependent on the number of managers trading. To illustrate, consider a dataset

<-----Page 142----->143

containing 100 managers who always trade in the same direction. If pt = 0.5, then in
a stock-period where all 100 managers trade the LSV measure is 46 percent. If only
10 of the 100 managers trade then the figure is 37 percent, and if only 2 trade then
the figure is 25 percent.57 So for a given level of correlation among the trades of
managers, some increase in the level of herding with the number of managers trading
is expected. By comparing the level of herding found in the actual dataset to an
estimate of the empirical sampling distribution, this effect can be accounted for.

4.5

Results of the accuracy tests of the LSV measure

4.5.1 The effect of the short selling assumption
The purpose of the tests reported in this section is to estimate a sampling distribution
of the LSV measure under the null conditions of no herding, firstly with, and then,
without, the short sales assumption relaxed.

4.5.1.1 Eliminating the ‘buy from zero holding’ records
First consider another, specific, test of the effect of the short selling constraint. Since
the short selling problem is associated with observations where the manager is
known to have traded a stock in the period but the initial holding was zero, we could
simply eliminate those data points. We would then start with a dataset that included
only observations where the manager bought from an initially positive position, left
the initially positive holding unchanged or sold the stock in the period.
The results of applying the LSV measure to the UK dataset with the ‘buy from zero
holding’ observations removed are reported in table 4.10.

The results are

substantially different to those in table 4.7 which report the LSV measure on the
whole dataset. The results seem to indicate much higher levels of herding in trades
that exclude buys from a zero holding. However, examination of the herding at the

57

bit/nit , the second term in this equation is decreasing in nit.

For a given value of

<-----Page 143----->144

individual stock-period level rather than averages shows that these results are
spurious.
The problem is as follows. For the largest stocks many managers hold a position in
the stock over long periods of time; decreasing or increasing their holding but
seldomly buying from an initial holding of zero.

So for the largest stocks,

elimination of the buy from zero holding records does not greatly change the
observations of buying and selling but it does greatly change pt which is reduced
from an average across periods of 0.58 to an average of 0.39. This reduction creates
the illusion of high levels of herding among the largest stocks. For example, table
4.9 shows that of the 25 stock-periods in which 30 or more managers trade, 18 are on
the buy side and 7 on the sell side. Table 4.10 shows that after eliminating the buy
from zero holding records there are 11 stock-periods in which 30 or more managers
trade. Of those 11 stock-periods, 9 are buy-side herding and 2 are sell-side. The
observations where managers buy are still numerous enough to increase the number
of stock-periods that are buy-side.
Because the omission of buy from zero holding records has a different effect on
different stock periods, it is not a suitable means of estimating the effect of the
invalid short sales assumption. There are two other good reasons for pursuing a resampling approach rather than just eliminating the buy from zero holding records.
Firstly, in addition to estimating bias caused by problems with the LSV measure, we
want to know whether zero herding can be rejected at the 95 percent level. For that
purpose we need a sampling distribution rather than just a measure on a reduced
dataset. Secondly, the most important results might be in the buy from zero holding
observations. So a means of estimating the bias and compensating for that bias, in a
measure on the entire dataset is desirable.

4.5.1.2 Re-sampling from the basic binomial distribution
The first step is to estimate the sampling distribution of the LSV measure by simply
redrawing from an estimate of the binomial distribution for each stock-period. For
each date the value of pt was estimated as ρt = Σibit/Σinit. Re-sampled datasets are
then constructed by replacing each observation, in which a trade occurs in the actual
dataset with a draw from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter ρt, being the

<-----Page 144----->145

estimated probability of a buy in that period. The results of applying the LSV
measure to 1,000 replicated datasets are reported in table 4.11.
The expected value of the LSV measure is not zero, even in this simple binomial setup for the following reason. The value of ρt in equation 3.4 is an estimate of pt. That
estimate is unbiased but contains errors. The effect of those errors is systematic
because of the absolute value operations in equation 3.4. We might expect that this
effect will be small in large datasets and that expectation is born out in the table 4.11
results. The bias caused by systematic errors in estimating pt is small for all subsets
of the stock-periods. For the stock-periods where a large number of managers trade,
and for the smallest stocks, the 95th percentile of the sampling distribution exceeds 1
percent.

4.5.1.3 Re-sampling from one trinomial for each period
The next step is to estimate the trinomial distributions which are the probability
distributions of the trade directions of the managers under conditions of no
systematic herding. For this purpose all observations in the dataset were formed into
15 separate groups. One group for each six month period in the dataset, with the first
period being January 31, 1986 to June 30, 1986.

Each manager reports their

portfolio holdings no more than once in each period.

Observations where a

manager’s initial holding was zero and no trade was made during the period are
included.
In each group the proportion of buy/hold/sell observations give the estimated
trinomial of those events. Each observation is then randomly redrawn from the
trinomial of its group. The LSV is applied and the process is repeated 1,000 times.
Summary statistics of the sampling distribution that is estimated in this way are
reported in tables 4.12 and 4.13. For table 4.13 each of the 15 period groups was
divided into one group for observations where the initial holding was zero and those
where it was positive.

Therefore, the results in tables 4.12 and 4.13 give a

comparison of the estimated sampling distribution of the LSV measure under null
conditions of no herding, with and without short selling in the replicated datasets.

<-----Page 145----->146

Table 4.12 reports sampling distributions with means of approximately zero. The
95th percentile values are all small except for the largest stocks. The ‘size rank of
stock’ panel shows that a finding of 2.7 percent herding in the five largest stocks has
a 5 percent probability even if the managers do not systematically herd. What causes
these spurious results among the largest stocks is not clear. It may be the systematic
effect of errors in estimating pt or it may be another effect that has been overlooked.
The results of table 4.13 suggest that the invalid short selling assumption is
important. The sampling distribution of the average level of herding in stock periods
where 20 or more managers trade has a mean of 7.8 percent and the 95th percentile is
9.4 percent. The corresponding mean and 95th percentile of the sampling distribution
for the stocks outside the 1,000 largest is 7.7 percent and 8.2 percent.

4.5.1.4 Grouping by size
However, in the datasets replicated for the table 4.13 sampling distributions,
important characteristics of the managers and stocks of the actual dataset are not
preserved. In particular differences in the probability of ‘hold’ occurrences between
large and small stocks.
A further level of grouping is introduced to capture the effect of size on the
probability distributions from which trade directions are drawn. In each period the
stocks are divided into deciles by their market capitalisation rank. The market
capitalisation of stocks on the London Stock Exchange is highly concentrated in the
largest stocks (see table 4.6). Consequently, if groups were formed on the basis of
size deciles, then the first decile would encompass roughly the 200 largest stocks,
most of the aggregate market capitalisation of stocks and most of the trades in the
dataset. Instead, deciles are formed from the log of the size rank of stocks with the
constraint that the first decile (of largest stocks) contains 10 stocks as described in
the methodology section.
Tables 4.14 and 4.15 show summary statistics of the sampling distribution created
from applying the LSV measure to 1,000 datasets which were re-sampled from the
period/size/initial holding groups. Table 4.14 shows the results where short selling is
assumed and table 4.15 shows results where that assumption is relaxed. With the

<-----Page 146----->147

short selling assumption in place the average level of herding found is small. Where
more than 25 managers trade, the mean of the sampling distribution is 1.1 percent
and the 95th percentile is 3.0 percent. As with table 4.12 results, the origin of these
biases is not clear, but the systematic effect of errors in estimating pt is one source.
Another possibility is that there is significant migration of stocks from low deciles to
high deciles, and vice versa, over time. The illusion of herding that can result from
small cap managers selling in unison stocks that become too large for their portfolios
is not eliminated when stock-periods are grouped by size. However, that effect is not
considered to be herding, so in a test like this it is desirable that it be captured in the
mean of the sampling distribution in the absence of herding.
Table 4.15 shows the effect of relaxing the short selling assumption. Comparing
tables 4.13 and 4.15 we can see the need for size grouping. The mean and 95th
percentile values of the sampling distributions are substantially reduced. They are
nonetheless significant. Comparing tables 4.7 and 4.15 it appears that a significant
amount of the herding found in certain subsets of the stock-periods is a result of the
LSV assumption that managers can short sell. In particular, for stocks outside the
largest and smallest stocks, where rank is between 20 and 100, the mean of the
sampling distribution is more than one half of the herding found on actual datasets.
Further, the 95th percentile of the sampling distribution is high for some subsets of
the stock-periods. Where the number of managers trading exceeds 30, the 95th
percentile is 4.8 percent. For stocks with a market capitalisation rank of more than
1,000 (that is, the smallest stocks), the mean of the sampling distribution under
simulated conditions of zero herding is more than one third of the herding measured
in the actual dataset.
Nonetheless, in each subset the level of herding found on the actual dataset exceeds
the 95th percentile of the sampling distribution under conditions of zero herding.

4.5.2 The effect of the invariance assumption
It is assumed in the LSV measure that the propensity to trade, pt , has the same value
for all stock-period-manager observations in the same period.

However, in the

dataset there is significant variation in pt by the relative size of the initial holding of

<-----Page 147----->148

the stock. To test the effect on the LSV measure of relaxing this assumption, an
estimate of the sampling distribution of the LSV measure is created under the
conditions of: no systematic herding; no short sales; and variation in pt by initial
holding.

The 1,000 replicated datasets are created by re-sampling from the

probability distribution of the trade direction for each observation, which is estimated
by grouping all observations by the four criteria of period, size, initial holding
quintile and whether the initial holding is positive or alternatively zero.

The

summary statistics of the sampling distribution of subsets of the stock-periods of
1,000 re-sampled datasets are reported in table 4.16. The grouping and re-sampling
was conducted for the five log deciles of largest stocks, which equates roughly to the
100 largest stocks. Comparing table 4.16 to 4.15 in the subsets where size rank is
less than 100, the main result is that the effect of variation in the propensity to buy
across observations in a period is small. When variation in pitj is included in the
trinomials from which the observations are redrawn, the effect is to slightly reduce
the mean and 95th percentile values of the re-sampling distribution under conditions
of zero herding.

4.6

Wermers measure applied to the UK dataset

Tables 4.17 and 4.18 report the results of applying the Wermers herding measure to
the dataset of 268 UK equity mutual fund managers. The Wermers results are shown
for different subsets of the data which are formed on the basis of the number of
managers trading and the market capitalisation rank of the stocks. Results are also
reproduced, for comparison, from the Wermers (1995) study of US mutual funds. In
the Wermers measure the managers are randomly divided into two groups and the
correlation between the aggregate portfolio weights changes of the groups is
measured. In this study, to reduce the variation in the results which arises from the
essentially arbitrary division of the managers, the reported results, including the tvalues, are the average from measuring 10 separate divisions of the managers.

<-----Page 148----->149

For the entire dataset the level of herding is 0.10.

This is an estimate of the

correlation in the portfolio weight changes of the two groups of managers.58 This
figure rises steeply with the number of managers trading the stock in a period, to 0.24
when 15 or more managers trade the stock.59 Wermers also finds large correlations
when measuring US mutual funds. The herding levels found in the subsets formed
by the number of managers trading are in every case significant at the 95 percent
level.
The measured herding is increasing in the market capitalisation rank of the stock,
from 0.06 with a t-value of 4.9 for stocks below the 100 largest, to 0.15 with a tvalue of 5.6 for stocks in the 50 largest. However, within the largest 50 stocks (over
half the market by value) the herding results do not vary with stock size. The
measured level of herding is more pronounced in subsets of the data where many
managers trade during a period than subsets where the stocks are very large.
Table 4.18 reports the Wermers measure of herding in the subsets of the data
classified by the investment objective of the managers. The results are mixed. The
Growth-Income and Income managers appear to herd strongly with the level of
herding increasing to 0.25, in both cases, in stock-periods where 10 or more
managers trade. This figure is larger than the corresponding subset of all managers.

58

The UK managers report their portfolio holdings on a cycle of either January-July, February-August

etc. There are 90 overlapping six month periods between January 1986 and December 1993 inclusive.
On average 40 managers report in each of the 90 periods. The Wermers measure is calculated for
each period and then averaged. The t values are the average divided by the standard error of the 90
values. Under the Wermers assumption of no correlation between managers’ trades, the 90 values are
uncorrelated. So the t tests are valid under their null conditions, but the overlapping nature of the data
should be considered in interpreting the results.
59

If the data exhibits heteroscedasticity, then the square of the correlation is not the R2 value in an

equivalent regression of portfolio weight changes in group A on the changes in group B. We might
expect heteroscedasticity because the stocks vary in size, the explanatory power of the regression
varies across observations and the data is aggregated.

Unreported results showed that there is

significant heteroscedasticity in the portfolio weight changes across stocks in each group in a single
period. For this reason we should only interpret the square of the Wermers measure as an R2 in the
tightly defined subsets, such as the stock quarters in which the stock is among the 20 largest.

<-----Page 149----->150

The Growth managers do not exhibit this pattern. When more than 10 Growth
managers trade the level of herding is insignificant.
In the geometric interpretation of the Wermers measure the finding of strong herding
among managers in large stocks means that in the asset space of large stocks the
portfolio weight vectors of the two groups of managers track each other through
time. We might think that this effect arises simply because both groups track the
index over time (buying stocks that become larger over time for instance). However,
unreported tests show that when the group A portfolio weight changes are regressed
on the Group B changes there is no difference in the regression results whether or not
the portfolio weight changes of the market index are included in the regression.

4.7

Results of accuracy tests of the Wermers measure

4.7.1 The effect of mis-specification
The Wermers measure assumes that the unconditional expected value of the portfolio
weight changes in a stock is zero. Therefore no sample average term is included in
the measure of correlation. This means that the expected sample correlation between
the portfolio weight changes in two stocks can be non-zero, even when no systematic
herding exists, if the expected value of the weight change is a function of the initial
holding in the stock. The most extreme case is where neither group initially holds
the stock but they both buy - the cross product of their portfolio changes must be
positive.
An estimate of the sampling distribution of the Wermers measure on a dataset which
is constructed to exhibit no herding and in which no short selling is present, is
created by measuring each of 200 replicated datasets with the Wermers measure.
Table 4.19 reports the summary statistics of the estimated sample distribution for the
subsets of the stock-periods which are formed on the basis of the number of
managers trading and the market capitalisation rank of the stock.
For each of the 200 replicated datasets the level of herding and associated t-value, is
calculated by the Wermers method. The second row of each panel reports the

<-----Page 150----->151

percentage of the measurements of the 200 replications that yield a t-value of two or
more. The results show that incorrect inference of the existence of herding, when no
systematic herding exists is a real danger with the Wermers measure. In only one of
the subsets (where the number of managers trading is greater than 20) is the
proportion of incorrect inferences less than 50 percent.
A comparison of tables 4.18 and 4.19 indicates that the miscalibration of the
Wermers measure is severe. For all but one of the subsets of the stock-periods
reported in table 4.19, the average level of herding found in the 200 re-sampled
datasets, is at least one half of the herding found by the Wermers measure in the
actual dataset.
We can, however, say from the simulation results that the Wermers measure finds a
significant level of herding in the UK fund manager dataset. For all but the n=20
subset of the stock-periods, the level of herding measured in the actual data is more
than two (estimated) standard deviations above the mean in the corresponding
estimated sampling distribution of the dataset transformed to eliminate herding.
Hypothesis tests with the estimated sampling distribution are in this case undertaken
with t-values because the 200 bootstrapping replications are not sufficient for tests
against the estimated 95th percentile. The Wermers measure of each replication is the
average of the sample correlation in 90 independent samples so we can appeal to the
Central Limit Theorem to justify the use of t-values. The estimates of the skewness
and kurtosis of the sampling distribution for each stock-period subset are reported in
table 4.19 and do not invalidate the use of t-values.

4.7.2 The effect of calculating weights with average prices
The miscalibration in the Wermers measure found in the bootstrapping test may arise
from mis-specification, the use of the average of beginning and end of period prices
in calculating portfolio weights, or some other factor. To separate the effects, the
dataset is transformed to eliminate herding and accentuate changes in weights arising
from price changes as opposed to changes in the number of stocks held.

To

transform the dataset, in each stock-period-manager observation the stock identity is
replaced with that of another stock which is drawn, without replacement, from a
stock in the same size group of 10 stocks. Table 4.20 reports the summary statistics

<-----Page 151----->152

of the estimated sample distribution for the subsets of the stock-periods which are
formed on the basis of the number of managers trading and the market capitalisation
rank of the stock.
The results in table 4.6 show that on the transformed dataset the Wermers measure
does not find any significant herding. However, for some subsets of the dataset, the
estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution is quite large. Where the
number of managers trading is at least 20 the estimated mean of the sampling
distribution is 0.05 and the estimated standard deviation is 0.09. On this subset of
the actual dataset the Wermers measure records a level of herding of 0.24. So we
can still reject the null hypothesis of no herding at the 5 percent level. For most of
the other subsets the mean and standard deviation are not large compared to those in
table 4.19.
We can conclude from this re-ordering test that there is some bias in the Wermers
measure other than that caused by the short sales assumption. That bias may be
induced by the use of average prices but in any case it is not large for most subsets of
the UK unit trust dataset.

4.8

Concluding remarks and future research

This chapter meets three of the four aims of the essay on tests of the accuracy of
herding measures using UK data. Firstly, to determine whether the empirical herding
literature is well founded. This is done by testing whether the principal measures of
herding of LSV and Wermers are accurate. That is, whether those measures find
herding where no herding exists. Or if herding does exist, whether the measures
overstate the level of herding present.
Secondly, to extend the empirical herding literature to an economy, outside the US,
which has a comparable investment management industry - in this case the UK.
Thirdly, to develop and demonstrate techniques for empirically estimating the
sampling distribution of a metric that is derived from portfolio holdings. In this case
the measure is of herding but it could just as easily be a measure of fund manager

<-----Page 152----->153

performance or performance persistence or any other measure derived from portfolio
holdings data.
It is common in the finance literature for researchers to develop a metric to measure
some phenomenon and then simply assume that in its absence the expected value of
the metric is zero. In the investment management literature this is the standard
approach for measures of herding, fund manager performance, performance
persistence and the like. When computing power was limited this was the necessary
approach.

But now, for most measures in investment management, researchers

should be able to estimate the distribution of their measures under simulated null
conditions to better determine whether the measure is properly calibrated.
Chapters 3 and 4 seek to analyse measures of herding from the perspective that
herding by fund managers arises because all fund managers face basically the same
portfolio choice problem. It is argued in chapter 3 that the existing explanations of
herding are each derived from one part of the manager’s portfolio choice problem.
Relative performance appraisal may cause the asset holdings of other managers to
enter a manager’s objective function, resulting in positive correlation of managers’
trades. Shared information may lead to positive correlation if managers collect and
process information in the same way, or the information is simply the trades
undertaken by other managers. Changes in the characteristics of stocks affect the
opportunity set of all managers causing positive correlation in trades.

Finally,

managers with new money replicating their portfolios represents a change of scale in
the portfolio choice problem which may also cause positive correlation.
When herding is viewed from this perspective it is clear that there are assumptions in
the LSV and Wermers measures that are not only counterfactual for some datasets
but potentially the source of significant bias. The tests reported here seek to isolate
the effects of invalid assumptions in the LSV measure that all managers can short
sell all stocks and that there is no variation in pitj with the initial holding of the stock.
The results indicate that for certain subsets of the dataset the short sales assumption
leads to an overstatement of the level of herding. Further, that the effect of the
variation in pitj due to different initial holdings is to understate the level of herding,
though this effect is small enough to be ignored.

<-----Page 153----->154

The bootstrapping tests reveal the high probability of finding herding, where none
exists, when using the Wermers measure. The severe miscalibration of the measure
for the dataset results from the mis-specification of the test, a part of which is caused
by the assumption that all managers can sell all stocks short.
In interpreting the results of the tests of short selling and variance of pitj the
shortcomings of these tests must be born in mind. Firstly, we cannot be certain that
the grouping and re-sampling technique eliminates all systematic herding from the
re-sampled datasets. Thus part of the mean of the herding measure applied to the
replicated datasets may be systematic herding that has survived the grouping and resampling. The LSV tests are built up a step at a time in an attempt to ensure that
systematic herding is not surviving and to isolate the effect of the invalid
assumptions that are being tested.
Secondly, are we comparing apples with apples? Not all the essential characteristics
of the actual dataset that are not associated with herding survive the grouping and resampling. Because the re-sampled data is a stylised version of the actual dataset the
effect of invalid assumptions on the herding measurement in those datasets is only an
approximation of the effect on the actual dataset.
Finally, only 1,000 new datasets are created in each LSV test and 200 in the
Wermers test. The 200 replications of the test of the Wermers measure only support
estimates of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution rather than estimates
of the 95th percentile. However, these results are compelling in their portrayal of
mis-specification of the Wermers measure; so, an increase in the number of
replications appears unlikely to change the nature of the accuracy test results.
This study of UK fund managers reinforces the findings of existing studies that fund
managers herd in their trading of stocks. Further, that a significant amount of
herding is found in the smallest stocks. This study looks at herding in the very
largest stocks and finds that it is increasing in market capitalisation. By testing the
accuracy of the measures upon which these studies are based, the foundation of
empirical herding literature is strengthened by the results reported here.

<-----Page 154----->155

The finance literature does not contain a precise definition of herding. The implicit
assumption in both the LSV and Wermers herding measures is that herding is a
positive contemporaneous cross sectional correlation in the trading of pairs of
investors in the group, which arises for any reason other than changes to the issued
capital of stocks. The broadness of this definition affects the usefulness of the results
of the LSV and Wermers measures. There is substantial evidence that herding exists
among certain groups of fund managers in subsets of the data but little can be said
about the causes of herding. To understand the consequences of herding a better
empirical understanding of the causes is needed.

Future tests of the causes of

herding should be against more specific null hypotheses.

Chapter 5 The Pension Fund Industry
5.1

Introduction

The current level of delegated portfolio management has arisen from investors
choosing fund managers. It is the story of millions of individual investors delegating
the management of their portfolios by choosing one or more fund managers from
among the many institutional fund managers that offer their services. The dynamic
re-structuring of the investment management industry is characterised by: the
concentration of funds in the hands of a relatively few very large investment
management firms, the winners; the diminution and exit of losers; and the continuous
entry of new investment portfolios offered by new and existing investment
management firms.

These dynamics result from the aggregation of the myriad

individual decisions of individual investors regarding which fund managers to invest
with, and then the period by period decision whether to retain those managers.
This essay, encompassing this chapter and the next, studies how investors choose
fund managers and how investors decide each period whether to retain a fund
manager for at least one more period, or alternatively, dismiss the fund manager and
choose another. The study proceeds by modelling the rational decision process of
investors in hiring and firing fund managers.
The motivation for studying these decisions is twofold. Firstly, to gain a better
understanding of the downside of the incentive schedule faced by fund managers. In
this essay the relationship between poor performance and the decision of investors to
withdraw their funds from a manager is modelled in an attempt to better understand
the downside of the fund manager incentive schedule.
The second objective is to better understand the aggregate effects of the decisions of
individual investors. The aggregate effects of interest to this study include: the
concentration of fund management in the hands of fewer managers; the equilibrium
level of passive investment management in the market; and the entry and exit of
managed portfolio products.

<-----Page 170----->171

The hiring and firing model is presented in chapter 6. The context of the model is
the UK pension fund industry.

There are advantages to giving the model this

context. Firstly, many UK pension funds have a one-to-one relationship with their
investment managers; meaning that a single investment management firm is chosen
to manage the pension fund’s entire portfolio of assets. Consequently, the trustee
g and firing is a discrete, observable decision with no
complicating portfolio effects.
Secondly, the information structure is particularly simple in this case. It can be
reasonably assumed that the investor receives portfolio performance information at
discrete points in time; usually quarterly. In this case a discrete model can be
realistically constructed, which facilitates the employment of Bayesian techniques.
Moreover, the investor can observe aggregate statistics on the universe of fund
managers, but cannot readily observe the performance of individual fund managers
other than their own. This property of the UK pension environment allows the vastly
simplifying assumption that investors consider only the performance of their own
fund manager in deciding whether to retain the manager each period.
The remainder of this chapter provides institutional detail on the UK pension fund
industry to aid the reader in understanding the context in which the crucial
assumptions of the model are made.

5.2

An overview of the UK pension fund industry

5.2.1 Pension funds and the economy
In the UK, occupational pension funds play a major role in private provision for
retirement income. In 1991, 57 percent of working men and 37 percent of working
women were members of occupational pension schemes (Goode 1993, p581). In
December 1996 the assets of UK segregated UK pension funds was £544bn (Office
for National Statistics, Financial Statistics).

In 1996, segregated pension funds

(excluding pooled funds managed by insurance companies) owned £276 billion in
UK equities. The sheer size of pension fund assets ensures that the decisions of the
managers of these funds collectively affect financial asset markets. The UK Inland

<-----Page 171----->172

Revenue statistics 1992 show that in 1988 the pension rights of occupational pension
scheme members were equal to 31 percent of marketable wealth.60
The 1995 Annual Survey of the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF)
reported an average pension scheme size of slightly less than £500 million, with 70
percent of the 800 survey respondents in the range of £10 million to £500 million.
The UK Government has provided tax incentives to encourage personal sector saving
for retirement through occupational pension schemes. Contributions to the pension
fund are made before tax for both firms and individuals. Benefits received are
generally taxable except for a lump sum.
Occupational pension funds are organised at the level of the firm. Pension schemes
benefit firms by: maintaining their competitiveness in the labour market; helping to
match the marginal productivity of workers to their remuneration; encouraging junior
workers to remain with the firm as their skills develop; and encouraging senior
workers to retire when their marginal productivity falls.

5.2.2 Defined benefit and defined contribution schemes
Pension funds fall into the two broad categories of defined benefit schemes (also
known as final salary schemes) and defined contribution schemes (also known as
money purchase schemes). In defined benefit schemes the firm promises to pay a
pension which is a fraction of the employee’s final salary. Typically the fraction
increases by an increment of 1/60th or 1/80th with each year of service. The scheme
may also pay a lump sum on retirement. Many schemes have some indexation of
pensions for price inflation.
The promised pension benefits are a liability of the firm. The firm makes regular
contributions to the assets of the pension fund as provision for meeting the liabilities
when they become due. The assets are held in trust and are therefore separate from
the assets of the firm. In most cases the firm makes a monthly contribution to the
pension fund which is a fixed percentage of total superannuated salaries/wages for
60

Marketable assets do not include pension rights.

<-----Page 172----->173

the month. The firm contributes a fixed percentage of each employee’s salary;
however, the firm reviews its contribution rate annually to ensure that the funding
rate is adequate. The firm’s shareholders bear the risk that the growth in asset values
may not be sufficient to meet the growth in liabilities, in which case the firm must
meet the deficiency.

This division of risk is considered economically efficient

because shareholders can diversify the pension risk across firms and therefore can
bear the risk at lower cost than the beneficiaries of the pension fund.
In defined contribution schemes the firm and the employee each pay a fixed
percentage of the salary into the pension scheme.

On retirement the employee

receives a pension which is commensurate with the growth of the value of assets in
the scheme and the employee’s share of those assets. This paper focuses exclusively
upon defined benefit schemes. In 1993, defined contribution schemes covered less
than 9 percent of UK employees in pension schemes (Goode 1993, p 583 table 6).

5.2.3 Control of the fund
The firm controls the existence of the pension fund. The trust deed sets out the
general features of the pension scheme and the power to appoint trustees. A schedule
to the deed contains the rules of the trust; including eligibility, benefits, and
contributions. The trust deed is drawn up by the firm.
There is no compulsion for the firm to have a pension fund. Moreover, the firm may
wind up the scheme, close it to new members, or freeze the scheme. UK firms
provide little information to shareholders regarding the pension fund. The annual
accounts typically contain a brief statement of the actuarial method of valuation, the
last date of valuation, and perhaps the current contribution rate. More detailed
information is usually provided in rights issue and take-over documentation.
The accounts of the pension fund are separate from those of the firm. However, in
most cases, the firm’s auditors also audit the pension fund. Moreover, much of the
administration of the pension fund may be undertaken by the firm. So the firm and
the pension fund are intricately linked at all levels. In the US pension funds often
invest significant fractions of their funds in the securities of the firm itself and

<-----Page 173----->174

pension funds may be simply run by the treasury department of the firm. Self
investing by pension funds is not permitted in the UK.

5.2.4 Role of the trustee board
The trustee board of the pension fund is separate from the firm. The trustees have a
duty to act in the interests of the trust’s beneficiaries, and to treat them equally. The
duties of the trustee board are to: oversight the funds of the trust to ensure their safe
keeping; decide upon allocation of the funds to asset classes; choose a manager or
managers for the funds; keep the beneficiaries informed of the status of the trust;
administer the pension fund; decide upon benefits levels; and act for the beneficiaries
in winding up the trust.
UK trustee boards usually have less than eight members and often four or less
(Brown, Davies, Draper 1992a).

Most trustee boards include an elected or

nominated representative of the beneficiaries.

In practice senior executives or

directors of the firm often form a majority of the trustee board members.
The interests of shareholders and pension fund beneficiaries are largely coincident;
however, where these interests diverge the trustee board must decide whose interests
to promote. Most of the literature on the US pension fund industry assumes that the
trustee board acts in the interests of shareholders. Trustees are legally obliged to
represent beneficiaries, but the actual objectives and incentives of pension fund
trustees are not well understood.

5.2.5 Agency structure of the pension fund industry
An interesting facet of delegated portfolio management in the pension fund industry
is that there are several levels of agency. The beneficiaries of the pension fund are
the ultimate principals in the relationship. They are represented by the trustees of the
pension fund who are required by law to act in the interests of beneficiaries.
Nonetheless, the trustee board is often dominated by the management of the firm who must represent the interests of shareholders in other matters. The trustee board
chooses an investment management firm to manage the assets of the fund. Finally

<-----Page 174----->175

the investment management firm tasks one of its fund managers to manage the
particular account.
The trustee board acts as agent to the beneficiaries and principal to the investment
management firm. The investment management firm acts as agent to the trustee
board and principal to the individual fund manager. The investment management
firm has an explicit contract with the trustee board and an implicit contract with its
fund managers; the investment management firm’s employee.
The delegated portfolio management literature for the most part ignores this
additional level of agency that exists between investors and fund managers. Yet in
optimal contracting, performance persistence, and other areas, this extra level of
agency is of crucial importance.

The UK pension fund management industry has

become highly concentrated in the last 10 years with the result that the largest
investment management firms now employ large numbers of fund managers. Merrill
Lynch Mercury Asset Management, the market leader, employs over 140 fund
managers Mercury Asset Management alone.

5.2.6 Funding levels
UK firms generally pay a constant fraction of their salary bill into the pension fund
on a monthly basis. This fraction, called the contribution rate, is usually set every
three years at the time of the actuarial review of the pension fund but is reviewed
annually to ensure that the minimum funding requirements of the Pensions Act 1996
are met.
Most schemes are currently well funded, with solvency at or near 100 percent. This
means that the actuarial value of the pension fund’s assets are 100 percent or more of
the actuarially estimated present value of the pension fund’s liabilities. The tax
exempt nature of pension schemes is a powerful incentive for the firm to maintain a
high level of funding. The Finance Act 1986 introduced a 105 percent solvency
ceiling to prevent firms using the pension fund as a vehicle for tax minimisation.
Regulations stipulate the calculation of solvency for tax purposes. If the fund is
more than 105 percent solvent for tax purposes, then 5 years are allowed for a run
down in the solvency, otherwise tax is applied.

<-----Page 175----->176

Assets in the pension fund in excess of those required for 100 percent solvency
represent a surplus. Since the late 1980s many schemes have accrued large surpluses
due to high investment returns and previously high funding levels. Surpluses can be
run down by: benefit improvements; contribution ‘holidays’ for the employer and
occasionally the employees; a reduction in asset values; or a transfer of surplus to the
firm. Transfer of surplus is uncommon and difficult for the firm to achieve. If the
solvency of the fund falls markedly below 100 percent, then the firm must inject
additional funds into the scheme.
“Under current legislation, any deficit of the pension scheme where the employer
becomes insolvent, is a debt of the employer. The debt created does not have
preferential treatment under the insolvency rules” (Goode 1993). Certain unpaid
contributions are preferential in insolvency. Deductions from earnings in the four
months preceding appointment of an insolvency practitioner are treated
preferentially. Further, deductions in the previous twelve months for employers
contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) can be
reclaimed from the National Insurance Fund. These amounts are typically small
compared to total pension fund liabilities. In respect to any shortfall in the pension
fund due from the firm, the pension fund is not a priority creditor.

5.2.7 Fund management
Most trustee boards appoint external investment managers for the assets of the
pension fund. Generally only pension funds with over £1 billion in assets find it
economical to conduct in-house management. Firms with less than 200 employees
generally find the risk of a self administered pension fund and the level of
administration unacceptable (Goode, p 586 table 10). They consequently purchase
administration services and insurance or annuity contracts, from insurance
companies.
Larger firms usually choose to be self administered and uninsured. Firms with less
than £50 million in pension fund assets usually choose a single fund manager to
manage a balanced fund. This means the single balanced fund manager (SBFM)
then chooses the allocation of funds among asset classes. The trustee board often
sets allocation limits of approximately +/- 5 percent for the major asset classes of UK

<-----Page 176----->177

equities, overseas equities, bonds, etc. The trustee board may preclude some asset
classes such as property. The balanced fund manager then chooses specific assets
within each class.
Above £50 million in pension fund assets, trustee boards often choose to diversify
the fund manager specific risk by employing more than one balanced fund manager.
Funds that are larger still may choose specialist managers for different asset classes.
Since the late 1980s there has been a trend toward specialist management in the UK
pension fund industry.
The different types of institutions offering fund management services include:
financial conglomerates; investment banks; the investment arms of retail banks;
specialist fund managers; insurance companies; and boutiques (offering niche
products in investment management). In this essay any firm offering investment
management services to pension funds is generically referred to as an investment
management firm. The term ‘fund manager’ is reserved for the individuals who are
employed by investment management firms to manage pension fund accounts. The
pension fund engages an investment management firm to manage part or all of its
assets. The investment management firm chooses a fund manager, who is a member
of its staff, to manage the account. Investment management firms vary in size from
those that employ 3 or 4 fund managers to the largest which employ over 100 fund
managers.
The trustee board and the investment management firm have a contract which can be
terminated at short notice.

These contracts usually stipulate flat rate fees and

performance based incentives are rare.61 The relationship between trustee boards and
investment management firms is highly fluid. Brown, Davies, Draper (1992a) report
the following figures from a survey of trustee boards. Last change to investment
management arrangements: current year 18.7 percent; last year 11.7 percent; two or
three years ago 25.7 percent; 4 or more years ago 28.3 percent; no recent changes
15.7 percent.

The level fees charged by UK and US pension fund managers are discussed in section 2.3.1.1

<-----Page 177----->178

5.2.8 Consultants and performance measurement
Most trustee boards engage consultants to advise them on management of the
pension fund. Consultants are particularly important in accumulating independent
sources of information on the performance of investment management firms. They
assist trustee boards with the choice of investment management firm, appraisal of
fund manager performance, and asset allocation.
Trustee boards and investment management firms employ performance measurement
service companies to provide independent measurement of the investment
performance of fund managers. Performance measurement in the UK is dominated
by the WM Company and CAPS which each measure the investment results of over
1,000 pension funds. From these results WM and CAPS each create a ‘universe’ of
pension funds. The critical descriptive figures of the CAPS and WM universes, such
as, median return, weighted average return, quartile returns, interquartile range, etc.
are widely quoted.

Many trustee boards base fund manager performance

benchmarks on one of these universes. For instance, a trustee board might stipulate
the WM weighted average plus 200 basis points as the performance that is expected
from the fund manager.

5.2.9 Information available to trustee boards
Trustee boards need performance data in order to make reasonable decisions about
which investment management firm to choose initially, and then to decide whether to
retain the investment management firm as time goes by. Investment management
firms employ a number of fund managers. In the selection process the investment
management firm usually presents to the trustee board a fund manager who has
achieved relatively high recent portfolio returns, as the manager who will manage the
trustee board’s funds. The trustee board will often ask the investment management
firm for data on the average performance of the investment management firm’s fund
managers, and the interquartile range of their performance. The measurement
services, WM Company and CAPS, will not release detailed information on the
breakdown of investment management firm performance by fund manager to the
trustee boards. However, since a large consulting firm may share many clients with
a large investment management firm, a more detailed picture of the distribution of

<-----Page 178----->179

fund manager performances within the investment management firm can be gleaned
from the records of the consultant.

5.2.10 Role of the actuary
Consulting actuarial firms provide advice to both the firm and the trustee board on
the status of liabilities and the sufficiency of pension fund assets to meet those
liabilities.

Actuarial reports are also required to meet certain regulatory

requirements. An actuarial review of the pension fund is usually undertaken every
three years.
The actuary estimates the present value of the liabilities of the pension fund. To do
this, economic assumptions about the growth of nominal wages and the growth of
asset income levels are made, followed by demographic assumptions about mortality
rates and retirement ages. Then the present value of liabilities is estimated, either on
the basis of accrued liabilities or, alternatively, the liabilities that are projected to
accrue over the employees’ service lives.
The actuary then looks at the earnings power of the pension fund assets. Simple
assumptions are made about the stream of earnings that will arise from the pension
fund assets. These earnings are then discounted back to the present using the same
discount factor as in the liability present value calculation.
The actuary estimates the contribution necessary to meet liabilities as they
accumulate over the next three years. This contribution rate might be 8 percent of
salaries for instance. If the actuarially estimated present value of assets exceeds the
actuarially estimated present value of liabilities, then the fund is in surplus. The
actuary will then calculate a reduction in the contribution rate that will run the
surplus down to zero over a certain interval.

5.2.11 The US pension fund industry
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA 1974) has a dominant
regulatory influence in the US pension fund industry and leads to industry outcomes
that are in many ways different from the UK industry. ERISA created the Pensions

<-----Page 179----->180

Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC). US firms with defined benefit schemes pay
a yearly premium to the PBGC for each employee covered.
The PBGC sets limits on maximum and minimum contribution levels, solvency
levels and asset allocation choices. The PBGC can wind up a pension fund that does
not meet its requirements. In return the PBGC insures the pension benefits of each
employee up to a maximum sum. The firm essentially has a put option which is
written by the PBGC. The firm can put its pension liabilities to the PBGC at an
exercise price of the assets of the fund plus 30 percent of the net value of the firm. If
the firm exercises the option then the PBGC may prevent the firm from creating
another defined benefit scheme. The PBGC insurance means that beneficiaries do
not bear default risk.

Therefore, PBGC insurance removes the main source of

conflicting interest between shareholders and beneficiaries.
The accounting of US pension funds is largely dictated by FASB 87. Firms cannot
include pension fund surpluses in their balance sheet but must include deficits. As in
the UK, the US actuarial practices permit a great deal of flexibility for the firms
pension fund accounts. US firms must lodge a Form 5500 with the Department of
Labour each year. The form includes: asset and liability figures; asset allocations;
and income and expense data.
Defined contribution schemes are more popular in the US where they comprise
nearly 50 percent of schemes.

Unlike the UK industry, asset allocation is

heterogeneous across US pension schemes (Papke 1991). Moreover, the pension
fund management industry is not as concentrated in the US as it is in the UK
(Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny 1992b). Finally, US firms choose more pension
fund managers than their UK counterparts and the management firms chosen are
more specialised by the asset class managed.

5.3

A review of the finance literature on pension funds

The literature on occupational pension funds spans the topics of labour economics,
welfare economics, public finance, management accounting and finance. The main

<-----Page 180----->181

body of the literature focuses on the US pension fund industry. However, the results
can often be adapted to UK circumstances.
Empirical work in pension funds has been restricted by a dearth of good data
resulting from the proprietary nature of major data sources. There has been a great
deal of research undertaken by performance measurement agencies, industry
organisations, regulatory bodies and committees of enquiry. This research is of
mixed quality - but is a valuable source of data.

5.3.1 Trustee board objectives
Much of the behaviour of pension funds is not well understood. Several immediate
examples are choice of asset allocation, asset allocation herding, choice of funding
levels, decisions on retaining or dismissing fund managers or choices of active versus
passive management. To understand decisions taken by pension funds we need an
understanding of the objectives of the pension fund trustees.

Of particular

importance is, firstly, the question of how the trustee board views risk; including,
total risk, market risk, and the correlation between firm value and pension fund
value. Secondly, how the trustee board acts in situations where the interests of
shareholders and beneficiaries conflict.
Brown, Davies, Draper (1992a) and the National Association of Pension Funds
Committee of Enquiry into Performance Measurement (1991) report survey evidence
on: how trustees view their decision-making; the composition of trustee boards; who
trustee boards represent; and the importance of risk. UK trustee boards state their
main objective as that of protecting the pension rights of beneficiaries. This answer
is not surprising in light of UK trust law and trustee board liability, but does not
always accord with the decisions of trustee boards.
As stated in the background section, the major difference in how shareholders and
the beneficiaries view the pension fund is the meaning and the significance of risk.
Papers relating to trustee board’s perception of risk in the UK include Nobles (1985,
1992) and Schuller and Hyman (1983). Nobles (1985) discusses the UK law relating
to trustees of pensions funds and how the UK courts have interpreted the law in
specific cases. Nobles discusses the ownership of surplus pension fund assets. The

<-----Page 181----->182

trustee board’s view of the treatment of surpluses is important for framing their view
of the potential payoffs to risks taken. Bulow and Scholes (1983) look at ownership
of surpluses in a US framework. Nobles (1992) examines the scope that trustees
have for decision-making in the pension fund. Schuller and Hyman (1983) examine
employee representation in UK pension schemes and the actual influence that
beneficiaries have over pension fund decisions.
Most papers on the US pension fund industry assume that decisions on the running of
the firm’s pension scheme(s) are taken in the interests of shareholders - even where
these interests conflict with beneficiaries. Bodie, Light, Morck and Taggart (1987)
call this the corporate financial perspective of pension schemes. They point out that
in the US insurance of benefits by the PBGC eliminates much of the
shareholder/beneficiary conflict of interest.

In contrast, the UK has no explicit

government backed insurance of occupational pension benefits.

Lakonishok,

Shleifer and Vishny (1992b) give a detailed description of decision-making in US
pension funds.

Petersen (1994) describes how firms adjust funding of pension

schemes to control operating leverage - an example of decisions on the pension
scheme being taken purely in the interests of shareholders.

5.3.2 Defined benefit versus defined contribution
The firm’s most fundamental decision regarding its pension fund is whether to have a
defined benefit or alternatively a defined contribution scheme. Blake (1996) shows
that the value of a pension scheme to the firm as a defined benefit scheme versus a
defined contribution scheme can be compared with simple option mathematics.
Bodie, Marcus and Merton (1987) examines this choice in terms of: differences in
risks faced by the firm and beneficiaries; inflation; funding flexibility; and the
importance of PBGC insurance of defined benefit schemes.

Petersen (1994)

concentrates on the influence of operating leverage on the choice. In the US, ERISA
legislation defines minimum and maximum contribution limits for defined benefit
schemes, whereas defined contribution schemes are not encumbered by these limits.
Petersen’s empirical research shows that firms with variable cashflows and a high
cost of financial distress are more likely to choose defined contribution plans.

<-----Page 182----->183

5.3.3 Funding asset allocation
On a period by period basis the trustee board or plan sponsors must decide the
funding level and asset allocation of the pension fund. Much of the finance literature
on pension funds develops theories of the choice of funding and asset allocation in a
US setting.
Sharpe (1976) and Treynor (1977) use simple contingent claims pay-off diagrams to
examine the effects of ERISA (1974) legislation.

Sharpe shows the perverse

incentive effects created by PBGC insurance. In Sharpe’s model, if all agents (firm,
beneficiaries, PBGC) react rationally to the risk of pension fund default by the firm,
then neither funding nor asset allocation decisions should matter. But if the PBGC
does not demand compensation commensurate with the risk of default (the generally
accepted view) then the optimal shareholder strategy is to minimise the funding level
and maximise the risk of the portfolio (in practical terms - hold more equity) to
maximise the value of the put. The PBGC insurance guarantee takes the form of a
put option in a one period model.
By assuming there is no default risk and considering tax aspects of the decision,
Black (1980) and Tepper (1981) arrive at the conclusion that firms should both
maximise funding and choose to hold only bonds: which is the exact opposite of the
Sharpe and Treynor prescription.

Black and Tepper look at funding and asset

allocation from the corporate financial perspective where the balance sheets of the
firm and the pension fund are considered as one.
Black argues that, in the absence of taxes, Modigliani-Miller (1958) considerations
dictate that the firm is indifferent to the funding and asset allocation policies. In the
presence of taxes, and ignoring default risk, firms can make a tax arbitrage gain as
follows. Pension fund stocks are all sold and are replaced in the fund by bonds of
equal value. Then (1-T)B of corporate bonds are issued by the firm to fund the
repurchase of the same amount of the firm’s equity (where T is the corporate tax rate
and B is the value of pension fund stocks sold). This rearrangement does not affect
firm leverage but does reduce tax paid by BT/r per year. Funding is maximised to
reap full benefits of the pension fund tax shield.

<-----Page 183----->184

Tepper’s justification for the same strategy is that because of the special tax status of
the pension fund, the stream of income from bonds in the fund are received by
shareholders with tax applied at the lower equity rate. Harrison and Sharpe (1983)
and Bulow (1982) show that if the PBGC insurance effects and tax shield effects are
considered together then firms will choose one of the extreme solutions (minimum
funding and maximum volatility or vice versa). There is no interior solution for
funding and asset allocation. Marcus (1983) analyses the value of PBGC insurance
in a model in which termination of the plan is endogenously determined - rather than
just imposed at the end of period. Under two separate regimes, voluntary termination
and alternatively, termination at bankruptcy, it is again found that an extreme
funding position is optimal.
Bicksler, Chen and Babcock (1985) show that if pension termination costs and an
asymmetric corporate income tax regime are included, then interior funding and asset
allocation solutions can be optimal - which accords with empirical findings of
interior solutions. Francis and Reiter (1987) find that high levels of funding are
driven by tax incentives, creation of financial slack and financial statement
incentives relating to relationship costs. Low levels are driven by PBGC insurance
effects, capture of pension fund surplus by beneficiaries and debt contracting costs.
There are surprisingly few empirical papers on pension funding and asset allocation
given the importance of these decisions to asset markets. Friedman (1983) collects
the asset allocations, income and expenses, and accrued liabilities of 20,000 defined
benefit plans in 1977. The 1974 ERISA legislation requires that US corporations
annually lodge a Form 5500 with the IRS and Department of Labour. Friedman uses
5500 data and Compustat data to examine the pension fund strategy of US firms. He
finds that firms with volatile earnings hold less equity and more debt in their pension
fund. The same result is found for highly leveraged firms but the opposite result of
low debt high equity characterises firms which have experienced high rates of return
on assets.
Bodie, Light, Morck and Taggart (BLMT 1987) use data from the US FASB 36
filings for 1980, and asset allocation data from a commercial source, to examine
funding and asset allocation decisions. They report the following findings. Discount

<-----Page 184----->185

rates chosen by firms to calculate the present value of liabilities is inversely related
to profitability. There is a positive relation between profitability and funding level.
There is evidence that firms facing higher risk and lower tax choose lower funding
levels. The percentage invested in bonds is negatively related to plan size and
underfunding. Finally, the distribution across funds of the percentage invested in
bonds is bimodal but not clustered around extreme distributions.
Papke (1991) uses Form 5500 data from 1981 to 1987 to present a wealth of data on
asset allocation of US plans in this period. He shows that US funds are quite
heterogeneous in their choice of asset allocation weightings.

His frequency

distribution diagram of the percentage invested in bonds has one mode at 45 percent
and another at 100 percent. Nearly 10 percent of funds held only fixed income
securities.
Papke points out that there are aspects of plans’ funding which are not captured in
this asset allocation data. Derivative securities (which could change the actual asset
allocation) are not reported. Moreover, plans may have strategies such as a stop loss
order where if equities fall to a certain level then equities are sold and bonds with a
duration equal to the duration of the plans’ liabilities are purchased.
The WM Company is a major UK based performance measurement service. WM
(1995) shows how the asset allocation of UK pension funds became increasingly
homogeneous in the period 1979 to 1993. Nonetheless, WM believe that claims of
asset allocation herding by pension fund managers are exaggerated, while their
results show that the interquartile range of weightings in UK equities in 1993 was
only 4 percent when the median weighting exceeded 50 percent. The 5-95 percentile
range is only 21 percent. Compared to the US pension fund asset allocation data, the
WM results actually seem to demonstrate a high level of asset allocation herding.
Blake, Lehmann and Timmermann (1999) study the asset allocations and returns of a
large set of UK pension funds and find little variation in fund performance due to
asset allocation herding. They attribute the existence of asset allocation herding to
the incentive structure faced by UK pension fund managers.

<-----Page 185----->186

Blake (1992) has a stochastic dynamic programming model of portfolio choice by
UK pension funds. He uses data on UK pension fund portfolio holdings from 1963
to 1978 (a period during which ownership of foreign assets was heavily
disadvantaged by capital/exchange controls). Blake looks at whether pension fund
portfolio choices were consistent with models of dynamic portfolio choice. His most
interesting finding, for this essay, is that “...private sector pension funds are only
moderately risk averse (indeed their portfolio behaviour could be described as close
to risk neutrality.)” (Blake 1992, page 161)
Michel and Shaked (1986) find that critical pension fund ratios, which relate
unfunded pension liabilities to the number of employees, total annual pension cost,
net worth, etc, vary across industries. Industry rankings for these measures remain
remarkably stable from year to year.
Feldstein and Seligman (1981), Feldstein and Morck (1983) and Bulow, Morck and
Summers (1987) look at whether share prices accurately reflect the unfunded pension
liabilities of firms. They create datasets that permit adjustments for the different
discount rates that firms use in calculating pension fund liabilities.

They

unanimously find that shareholders do adjust share prices for unfunded liabilities.
Moreover, that firms choose discount rates strategically: underfunded firms choose
high discount rates and overfunded firms (the majority) choose low discount rates.

5.3.4 Investment management decisions of trustee boards
In addition to decisions on: defined benefit versus defined contribution; funding
level; and asset allocation; the trustee board faces decisions on the choice of fund
manager. Initially three fundamental choices must be made between: internal or
external fund management; active or passive management; and balanced or specialist
management. Then a manager or managers must be chosen and each period a
decision must be taken on whether the manager is retained or, alternatively,
dismissed.
The academic literature does not much discuss these decisions. Lakonishok, Shleifer
and Vishny (1992a) discuss these matters but provide no model and little evidence.
Brown, Davies and Draper (1992a) report survey data on the frequency with which

<-----Page 186----->187

UK trustee boards alter their fund management arrangements, and the performance
measures that are considered important by trustee boards.

Brealey and Hodges

(1972) undertake a simulation study of portfolio performance and find that even for
highly informed managers, 100 or more quarters of data is required to reject the null
hypothesis of no information at the 95 percent level. Ashton (1996) arrives at a
similar result by creating an econometric lower bound for the number of observations
required to identify informed managers.
The literature is remarkably silent on the decision process by which investors decide
to retain or dismiss their fund manager. There appears to be no literature on this
question in a pension fund framework. The literature on the explicit and implicit
forms of fund manager incentives is reviewed at length in chapter 2.

5.3.5 Survivorship bias
Survivorship bias refers to the bias in results that arises from omitting firms that do
not survive the entire sample period. One effect is the increase in the cross sectional
average of fund returns if survival is related to relatively good performance.
Grinblatt and Titman (1989b) results indicate that this effect is fairly small, between
10 and 40 basis points per year.
A separate form of survivorship bias arises if fund managers differ cross sectionally
in the variance of their portfolios and survival is related to performance. Brown,
Goetzmann, Ibbotson and Ross (1992) have shown that under these circumstances,
the truncation of the cross sectional distribution of portfolio returns can induce the
illusion of performance persistence. Their simulations show that modest truncation
can substantially bias the inferences of performance persistence tests.
An attrition rule (dismissal rule) relates survival in a period to the history of fund
performance. The form of the attrition rule determines, firstly, whether the bias is
toward or, alternatively, against finding persistence and, secondly, the magnitude of
the inferential bias. A dismissal rule is a form of attrition rule. Therefore if the
retention/dismissal process can be modelled and a dismissal rule estimated then it
may be possible to reassess the results of previous studies of pension fund
performance persistence and illuminate the design of future studies. LSV (1992a)

<-----Page 187----->188

and Brown, Draper and McKenzie (1997) have found persistence in pension fund
performance in the US and UK respectively.

Chapter 6 Hiring and Firing Fund Managers
6.1

Introduction

Investors who opt for delegated portfolio management have a large number of
professional fund managers to choose from, including active managers and passive
managers. Investors use information available at the time that funds are invested to
choose one or more fund managers. Over time new information arrives. At a cost,
the investor can enact some combination of the following actions: dismissal of one or
more of the fund managers and employment of new managers; re-balancing of the
investment across the existing managers; and/or re-negotiation of the contractual
terms with one or more managers.
In deciding which managers to choose, investors may have preferences over several
characteristics of fund managers, including: size of funds under management; range
of services provided; administrative support; and location of offices. However, a
major consideration for all investors who choose active management is the ability of
the fund manager to add value by attaining positive risk adjusted excess-tobenchmark returns.
Investors receive performance results at regular intervals.

If the fund manager

performs poorly, other things equal, the investor must decide whether to change for
the next period the value of assets delegated to that manager.62 In this chapter the
following simple case is modelled. An investor chooses a single fund manager on
the basis of the information available at time t0. Performance results then arrive at
the end of each period, at which time the investor decides whether to continue with
the manager, or alternatively, incur cost K and choose a new manager.

The

investor’s optimal manager dismissal policy is derived here for a two period model.
In this essay the investor’s problem is placed in the specific context of a pension fund
trustee board’s relationship with its single balanced fund manager.
62

There are

Contractual terms between investors and institutional or retail investment managers are rarely

renegotiated (Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny 1992a, Golec 1992, Goode 1993).

<-----Page 189----->190

advantages to choosing a pension fund context. Firstly, assumptions about risk,
contractual form and costs can be made simple and reasonable.

Secondly, the

descriptive results of the modelling can be compared to known institutional
arrangements in the pension fund industry.
Most of the performance measurement literature analyses problems associated with
measures of asset selection or market timing abilities. Brealey and Hodges (1972)
and Ashton (1996) take a different tack. They discuss the practical difficulty of
getting enough observations to make inferences about measures of fund manager
ability. Brealey and Hodges simulate optimal portfolio formation by managers who
have various levels of stock selection and market timing ability. They show that for
a manager who has a correlation between predicted stock return residuals and
realised residuals of 0.15 (a high figure), approximately 100 quarters of data would
be required to attain 95 percent confidence that the correlation is not zero. Ashton
seeks an econometric lower bound for the number of observations required to discern
plausible levels of manager forecasting ability. He similarly finds that over 100
periods of data are required.
But we know that trustee boards do not wait 100 periods before making decisions. In
fact the relationship between pension fund trustee boards and fund managers is quite
fluid. Brown, Davies and Draper (1992a) report that 56.1 percent of their trustee
board survey respondents indicated that they changed their relationship with one or
more of their fund managers in the previous 3 years.
The Brealey and Hodges, and Ashton approaches ignore two crucial aspects of
trustee board behaviour. Firstly, levels of statistical certainty are incidental to the
investor’s decision. Rather, the investor has an objective, such as minimisation of
the cost of a pension scheme, in which the choice of manager is a decision variable.
The critical level of certainty about fund manager ability, at which the decision to
change managers is made, is determined endogenously and varies with the
circumstances of the problem - such as the cost of changing manager. Secondly, the
investor has prior information about the manager’s ability to add value. It is hard to
imagine how an investor could choose a manager from a completely uninformed
position.

<-----Page 190----->191

The investor’s decision process involves the combination of prior information with
evolving sample information to choose optimally between mutually exclusive
decisions (to retain or dismiss) which have stochastic payoff states. This is naturally
a Bayesian updating decision problem. Naturally - because it seems indisputable that
investors update their information through time and then choose optimally from a set
of managers.
A two period model of the optimal manager dismissal policy is developed here.
Heinkel and Stoughton (1994) develop a two period Bayesian updating model of
manager performance. Their purpose, however, is to explain observed features of
investor/fund manager contracts, such as flat rate fees, boiler plate contracts and
independent performance measurement.
A model of an investor’s rational fund manager dismissal policy has a number of
potential applications. Firstly, in understanding incentives faced by fund managers.
A better understanding of the structure of incentives faced by fund managers may
help to explain features of the individual and collective behaviour of fund managers;
such as, momentum investing, herding, index tracking and mean reversion of returns
in ‘universes’ of fund managers. As discussed in Chapter 2, most fund managers in
the mutual fund and pension fund industries are employed on fixed fee contracts
(Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny 1992a, Golec 1992, Goode 1993).

Poor

performance does not usually result in lower fees but it may lead to termination of
the contract. The investor’s dismissal policy relates fund manager performance to
dismissal, which in turn characterises the downside risk faced by that investor’s fund
manager.
In addition, a manager dismissal model can illuminate dynamics in the overall
relationship between pension fund trustees and pension fund managers. Brown,
Harlow and Starks (1996) view the fund management industry as a tournament. The
tournament ‘winners’ get the new funds flowing into the industry each year. The
others gain no new investment money but also lose little. Sirri and Tufano (1998),
Goetzmann, Greenwald and Huberman (1992), Capon, Fitzsimmons and Prince
(1996) provide results which support this theory. Ippolito (1992) looks at how
investors react to poor performance. Goetzmann and Peles (1997) seek to explain

<-----Page 191----->192

the seemingly unnatural length of time that investors retain poor performing
managers, in a cognitive dissonance framework.63

A manager dismissal policy

provides an additional framework in which to examine these industry dynamics.

6.2

A model of investors’ hiring and firing decisions

6.2.1 The structure and assumptions of the model
This model of optimal fund manager dismissal policy is developed in the context of a
pension fund trustee board which delegates management of its assets to a single fund
manager. At time t0, which is the beginning of period 1, the investor chooses a
manager from among a ‘universe’ of a large number of managers. At the end of each
period the investor receives the portfolio performance figures for the period which
include the benchmark return and the excess-to-benchmark return, as described
below. The investor then decides whether to retain the manager for at least one more
period, or alternatively, dismiss the manager and choose the best alternative manager
from the universe of managers. The assumptions of the model are as follows.
A.1

The trustee board’s sole objective in choosing a fund manager is the
minimisation of the cost of meeting pension fund liabilities.

A.2

The return on the pension fund’s portfolio in period n has two components; a
benchmark return and an excess-to-benchmark return. The excess-tobenchmark returns are assumed to be normally distributed about mean µ with
precision τ, and the values of those parameters vary across fund managers.
Equation 6.1
rpn = rbn + xn
xn ~ N (µ,τ) , n Î {1, 2, …}

63

See also Shefrin and Statman (1985) and Odean (1998a) for discussion of the disposition of private

investors to hold on to poor performing investments for too long.

<-----Page 192----->193

Where

rpn = return on the portfolio in period n (the period beginning at
time tn-1)
rbn = return on the benchmark portfolio in period n
xn = the excess-to-benchmark return in period n
µ

= the mean of the excess-to-benchmark return distribution of the
incumbent manager

τ

= the precision of the excess-to-benchmark return distribution of
the incumbent manager.

All returns are after fees, expenses and turnover costs.

A.3

The portfolio benchmark is chosen such that the excess-to-benchmark returns
are independent of the factors that determine asset returns.

A.4

The stochastic process generating each manager’s excess-to-benchmark
returns is assumed to have time invariant parameters.

By assumption A.1, the trustee board seeks to minimise the present value of the
cashflows from the firm to the pension fund. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between increases in the excess-to-benchmark return and reduction in the cashflows
to the pension fund.64
The excess-to-benchmark return is a metric for value added by the manager, and
therefore should not reflect exposure to priced factors. The benchmark portfolio
return can be formed as the fitted or explained return in a factor model that includes
all priced factors. The excess-to-benchmark return is then simply the residual of the
factor model estimation. Therefore, the average of excess-to-benchmark returns can
be interpreted as a multi-factor version of Jensen’s alpha (Jensen 1968). In which
case, the excess-to-benchmark return is seeking to measure value added by stock
64

How pension fund decisions are actually taken, and exactly whose interests are represented by the

decision makers, is not well understood. Legally, the trustees are required to act exclusively in the
interest of the beneficiaries. However, trustee boards are often dominated by the management of the
firm. Here I assume that the trustee board considers only market risk of the firm’s free cash flows,
thereby representing the interests of shareholders. This isn’t an unreasonable assumption: trustee
boards must balance the interests of shareholders and beneficiaries where they conflict. Beneficiaries
can be compensated by higher solvency levels or higher benefits.

<-----Page 193----->194

selection rather than factor or market timing by the manager.65 The importance of the
assumption that the excess-to-benchmark return is independent of priced risk factors
is that it allows the considerable simplification of discounting of expected excess-tobenchmark returns at the risk free rate.
The probability distribution of the benchmark return is chosen by the trustee board.
The distribution of the excess-to-benchmark return is specific to fund managers.
Each manager is fully characterised by a stochastic process for the manager’s excessto-benchmark portfolio conditioned by the benchmark set by the trustee board. Each
realisation of that process is a draw from a normal distribution which has time
invariant parameters.
Let

θi = (µi,τi)

be the mean and precision of the distribution of excess-to-

benchmark returns for manager i. There is a large group of fund managers from
which the trustee board may choose.

From the trustee board’s perspective the

managers vary only in the mean and precision of their excess-to-benchmark returns
over the benchmark portfolio; reflecting the managers’ different investment abilities,
incentives and risk preferences. The trustee board aims to appoint the manager that
is expected, over time, to add the most value to the funds under management.
Implicit to assumption A.4, of time invariance of the manager’s excess-to-benchmark
return distribution, is an assumption that managers are not strategically varying the
distribution parameters µ and τ through time as their realised performance changes
their incentives. This assumption also means that the dilution of fund manager’s
r invested’, resulting from new funds flowing to well
performed fund managers, has no effect upon the mean of the excess-to-benchmark
return distribution.
The trustee board uses all the initially available information to form a prior
probability distribution over θi = (µi, τi) for each manager i at time t0. The available
information includes the investment performance history of the manager, but might

65

Until recently there was little evidence of market timing ability among institutional investors.

Studies by Ferson and Schadt (1996) and Chance and Hemler (1998) find evidence of timing ability.

<-----Page 194----->195

also include other information, such as recent personnel changes or investment in
new technologies. In this Bayesian view, θi is a random vector.
From the trustee board’s perspective the universe of managers represents a set of
projects, where each manager’s excess-to-benchmark return in a period is the cash
flow from the project which is that manager. At the end of any period the trustee
board can switch from one project (manager) to another at a known cost of K per £
invested. From the prior distribution on θi, denoted V(q), the trustee board is able to
value the anticipated stream of excess-to-benchmark returns, and manager change
costs, which follow the choice of manager i to manage the pension fund portfolio
from time t0. This value, denoted V0i is the value of active management to the trustee
board at time t0 conditional upon the initial choice of manager i. It is determined in
equation 6.2 under the following assumptions.
A.5

The market value of the pension fund portfolio is re-balanced to £1 at the
beginning of each period.

A.6

The income and assets of the pension fund are not taxed.

The interest rate on risk free assets is constant through time.

Equation 6.2 characterises the valuation of each manager as a net present value
problem. V0i is the value to the trustee board of active management conditioned by
the trustee board’s information set at time t0 and the choice of manager i at time t0. It
is the discounted sum of the value added to the portfolio by active management in
each period. That value added is the excess-to-benchmark return of the incumbent
manager less any cost incurred in changing manager at the end of the period. The
equation recognises that the identity of the incumbent manager may change.
The trustee board can associate a value V0i with each manager i in the universe of
managers under consideration. After ranking the available managers, the trustee
board chooses the manager which maximises the value of active management of the
trustee board’s portfolio.66

Passive management can be approximately characterised by an excess-to-benchmark return which

has a known mean of zero and variance of zero. The manager’s problem is trivial in this case - the
value of index management is simply zero. If the trustee board does not assign a positive value to the
management of any of the active portfolio managers then passive management is chosen and there is
no reason to change manager in any future period.

Assumption A.8 ensures that the trustee board makes decisions on the basis of the
mathematical expectation that, in any period, if the current manager is dismissed,
then after reassessing the universe of other managers the value of the chosen
manager will be Va.
The chosen manager is offered and accepts a flat fee contract. The terms of the
contract are not renegotiated at any point. Having chosen a manager, the trustee
board receives performance results at the end of each period.
If after n periods there has been no change of manager then the trustee board has
observed a vector of excess-to-benchmark returns x = (x1,....,xn). Let Vnr denote the
value of active management at time tn conditional upon retention of the manager for
at least one more period. The value of active management at time tn if the manager is
dismissed is Va-K. The value of active management at time tn is then the maximum
of Vnr and Va-K.

The only changes in the trustee board’s information set are the performance

6.2.2 Illustration of the value of active management
6.2.2.1 Manager with permanent tenure
Much of this essay is concerned with modelling the determinants of the value of
active management to the investor.

To begin, consider a trustee board that is

choosing a manager who after appointment will then have permanent tenure. In this
case the choice of manager is a simple net present value problem.

After n periods, during which x = (x1, x2, ,xn) is observed, the posterior probability
distribution over θ = (µ,τ), denoted ξn(θ

trustee board’s expected value of µ at time tn.67

Under the assumption of permanent tenure for the chosen fund manager the value of
portfolio management can be depicted in a two dimensional diagram. Figure 6.1
shows that the initial value is V0 and a trustee board will only choose active
management over passive management if m0 > 0. That is, active management is
chosen over passive management if the expected value of the mean of the excess-tobenchmark return distribution of the chosen manager is greater than zero. After the
manager is chosen the vector of excess-to-benchmark returns evolves period by
period. V0 and Vn are related by the equation 6.9.

6.2.2.2 Option to change manager
Now assume that the trustee board has a one-off option to dismiss the manager at
time tn and choose a new manager, and then the new manager or retained manager
has permanent tenure. The value of delegated portfolio management at time tn is then
the maximum of either the value conditioned on retaining the existing manager,
denoted Vnr, or the value conditioned on dismissing the existing manager which is
the value of the best alternative manager, denoted Va, less the cost K of switching to
the best alternative manager.

6.2.2.3 Option to change the manager at any time
The option at tn, to dismiss the incumbent manager and employ the best alternative
manager, puts a floor under the value of active management at that time. Now
consider the conditions that trustee boards actually face – the option to change
manager at the end of any period. Now Vnr denotes the value of delegated portfolio
management conditional on retaining the manager for one or more periods.
Where the trustee board can dismiss the manager at any point in time, the decision at
the end of each period is between two actions. Firstly, to choose a new manager at
cost K. Or alternatively, to postpone the decision to change manager to the end of
the next period at which time another observation from the fund manager’s excessto-benchmark return is available. This decision is analogous to that of an investor
deciding whether to pay a known cost to abandon one project and commence another
project. The ‘real’ option, to delay the abandonment decision, by one or more
periods, has value. The value derives from the resolution, during the period of delay,
of some uncertainty over a variable that affects the value of the project.

<-----Page 202----->203

As with options on financial assets, insight can be obtained by considering limiting
cases. Here the limiting case is that of the sample mean of the excess-to-benchmark
return approaching positive infinity or approaching –1. In either case the value of the
option to decide in future periods approaches zero.

Equation 6.11 shows that, conditional on the retention of the existing manager for at
least one more period, the value of delegated portfolio management is the sum of two
quantities. The first is the discounted value of the expected excess-to-benchmark
return in the next period. The second is the expected value of delegated portfolio
management at the end of the next period discounted to the present. For Vnr as a
function of mn, the asymptotes as mn goes to +¥ or –1 are easily deduced.

As mn goes to +∞ investor sample information dominates any prior information. The
investor’s subjective probability of observing a sequence of excess-to-benchmark
returns that would lead to dismissal of the existing manager goes to zero. This
implies that the value of the option to dismiss the manager in any future period goes
to zero, and the manager effectively has permanent tenure. Therefore, Vnr → mn/r
from above (because the option goes to zero from above).
As mn goes to –1 and n goes to ∞ the probability that the excess-to-benchmark return
in the next period will be sufficient to prevent dismissal of the manager at time tn+1
approaches zero. Therefore the value of the option, to retain the manager for one
more period after the next period, goes to zero. For finite n, the probability that the
manager is dismissed next period is finite. For finite n we have a lower bound rather
than a lower asymptote for Vnr.

<-----Page 204----->205

Figure 6.3 depicts the upper asymptote and lower bound of Vnr. A curve is fitted to
the asymptotes for illustrative purposes.68

The vertical distance between the

asymptotes and the Vnr curve represents the option value of delegated portfolio
management. The value of mn below which the manager is dismissed at time tn is
mnc. As in the classic investment under uncertainty problem, the required rate of
return on the project before the trustee board acts is higher when value of the option
to delay the decision is included. The result is mnc < r (Va – K).

6.2.2.4 The Bellman functional equation
Continuing the expansion of the expression for the value of delegated portfolio
management we have the following equation.

This expression is a recursive Bellman equation which can be expanded indefinitely.
The trustee board faces a dynamic programming problem. They can choose to retain
the manager or acquire more information. The option to delay now is an option on
all the future options to delay and hence the expression has an infinite expansion.

68

Note that figure 6.3 is drawn with all variables that affect Vn, other than mn, held constant.

In particular parameters of the posterior distribution of θ that characterize the uncertainty

<-----Page 205----->206

Vnr and Vn+1r are functions which are related by the functional equation 6.13. The
trustee board wishes to compare Va - K, which is known, to Vnr which is a function of
x the vector of observed excess-to-benchmark returns. From equation 6.11 we can
r
. We can
see that to solve for Vnr we need to know the functional form of Vn+1
r
proceed to a solution by guessing Vn+1
and then solving for Vnr , then using this form
r
as the next guess for Vn+1
. Convergence is guaranteed, under modest regularity

conditions, by the Contraction Mapping Theorem of functional equations.69

An

equivalent solution can be obtained by assuming a termination time when the fund is
wound up and working backwards recursively.

6.3

A two period model

To solve the functional equation which determines the value of delegated portfolio
management, a functional form of the prior distribution over θ must be specified. It
is assumed here that the parameters of the manager’s excess-to-benchmark return, θ
= (µ,τ) have a gamma-normal distribution. The normal distribution of the excess-tobenchmark return, x ~ N[µ,τ], and the gamma-normal distribution of the parameters
of that normal distribution, θ = (µ,τ), form a Bayesian conjugate pair. This means
that when the sample data drawn from the normal distribution is combined with the
gamma-normal prior, the resulting posterior distribution is also gamma-normal.
In the course of this analysis several Bayesian conjugate pairs were considered for
the modelling of the return distribution and the prior, including, the binomial--beta
conjugate pair; the exponential--gamma conjugate pair; the Poisson--gamma
conjugate pair; and the normal--gamma-normal conjugate pair.

None of the

available conjugate pairs leads to a closed form solution for Vn where the trustee
board’s investment horizon is infinite. If assumptions are made about the parameters
of prior distribution, the interest rate r and the cost of changing managers K, then a

over µ are held constant.
69

See Dixit and Pindyck, (1994, p102), or Stokey and Lucas (1993, p50).

<-----Page 206----->207

numerical solution for Vn can be obtained. The next section presents the simulation
results.
In this section, to pursue an understanding of the relationship between variables in
the trustee board’s problem, a closed form solution is obtained by reducing the
trustee board’s investment horizon to two periods from the decision date tn. In the
two period model, the trustee board is making the dismissal decision n periods after
the incumbent manager was initially appointed. Therefore xn=(x1,x2,..,xn) has been
observed at the decision point. Further, the investment horizon time is tn+2. Meaning
that the trustee board must decide at time tn whether to retain or dismiss the manager,
then make the equivalent decision at time tn+1, and then the fund is wound up at time
tn+2. Figure 6.4 depicts the decision timing.

To proceed we need to assume a form for the prior distribution over the mean and
precision of the excess-to-benchmark return distribution. Assume that θ has a
gamma-normal distribution. Also known as the gamma inverse normal distribution,
where variance takes the place of precision. See DeGroot (1989, p402) for the
standard gamma-normal distribution results given here.

The gamma-normal Bayesian conjugate pair is suitable for this analysis for several
reasons. Firstly, in the gamma-normal distribution the information is combined in an
intuitively appealing way, as shown below in the explanation of how the parameters
update.

Another appealing property of the gamma normal distribution is the

relationship between the precision of the excess-to-benchmark return xn and the
precision with which m is known. For a given t the precision of m is lot. This means
that if l0>1, then the less noise there is in observations of the manager’s excess-tobenchmark returns (higher τ), the more precise will be the prior over µ (higher λ0τ).

<-----Page 208----->209

Finally, the gamma normal distribution has a flexible shape which can accommodate
a wide range of plausible prior beliefs.
To establish the prior distribution, the trustee board chooses α0, β0, λ0 and m0 such
that:

The mean of the marginal µ distribution

= m0

The variance of the marginal µ distribution =

The process of updating parameters is highly intuitive. The expected value of µ after
excess-to-benchmark returns have been observed, denoted mn, is a weighted average
of the sample and prior information. Each weight reflects the amount of information
contributed by that source. The parameter l0 controls the balance between the prior
and sample information in determining mn.
The Bayesian predictive distribution of the unknown xn+1 can be obtained as follows.

compares this value to Va-K. Where Va is calculated using the µ0a, λ0a, βoa and α0a

Vnr is a function of : x n the sample mean of the observed excess-to-benchmark
returns; sn2 the sample variance; n the number of observations. Only the first two
sample moments are important - as might be expected from a prior distribution based
upon normal and gamma functions.

6.3.2.1 Alternative model specification
The two period model of investors’ hiring and firing decisions has the investor
deciding at time tn, two periods from the investment horizon, whether to retain or
alternatively dismiss the manager. One period later at time tn+1 the investor must
again decide whether to retain the (possibly new) manager or choose another
manager for the last period. As shown in equation 6.24 , at tn the value of active
management conditional upon retaining a manager that has been employed for n
periods is given by equation 6.24.
An alternative set up is for the investor to have a different choice at tn+1, between
granting the then incumbent manager permanent tenure or alternatively choosing the
best alternative manager who will have permanent tenure. In this model the value of
active management at tn, conditional on retaining the existing manager is:

The value of xn+1 at which the investor is indifferent between retention or dismissal of
the manager at time tn, denoted xcn+1 is higher in equation 6.24 than 6.25 by λn+1K.
Nonetheless, the models are qualitatively alike. In section 6.5 results of a simulation
of the hiring and firing model are presented. The simulations are for an investor’s
decision on whether to dismiss the manager where the investment horizon is 10 years
hence. The longer the horizon, the less important are the terminal conditions to the
decision today. Since equations 6.24 and 6.25 are so similar in form, the simulation
study is conducted only for the model where, at the end of the investment horizon,
there is no further investment.

Implications of a dismissal policy

The trustee board’s valuation of portfolio management after n periods is a function of
parameters, constants and state variables.

α0, β 0, λ0, m0

The parameters of the prior distribution over θ.

k, r

The constants which are exogenous to the trustee
board’s decision making.

2
x n , sn , n

The state variables of the dynamic programming
problem faced by the trustee board.

The comparative statics of these variables can provide insight into various influences
upon fund manager dismissal decisions. The two period gamma-normal model of
fund manager dismissal supports the following propositions.

6.4.1 Proposition 1:
If the vector of reported excess-to-benchmark returns is xn = (x1, ......,xn), then x n , sn2 and n
are sufficient to determine Vn .

This follows directly from equation 6.24 and the value rule Vn = Max [Vnr , Va-K] .
The result implies that, conditional upon a gamma-normal prior, trustee boards need
only know the number of performance observations and the first two moments of
those observations to attain the value of active management after n periods. It also
implies that the value process is Markovian rather than path dependent, because of
the Bayesian nature of the decision process.

<-----Page 218----->219

6.4.2 Proposition 2:
The value of active management is non decreasing in uncertainty over the expected value of
the manager’s excess return.

δ Vn
βn
≥ 0 where σ 2µ =

λn αn

is the variance of the expected excess-to-

benchmark return after observing xn = (x1, ......,xn)

If the investor retains the manager for period n+1, then there is a unique value of xn+1,
denoted xcn+1, for which the investor is indifferent between retaining or dismissing the
manager at the end of that period. Equation 6.24 can be rearranged to express Vnr in
an option form.

In the first expression the integral term represents the value of a European call option
with a strike price at xcn+1, over an asset, the value of which has a t distribution with
mean mn and variance ln+1su2 at the strike date, which is one period hence. In the
second expression the integral term represents the value of the corresponding put
option. Since it is well known that these option terms are strictly increasing in the
variance of the value of the underlying asset and since none of the other terms are
functions of that variance we know that:

<-----Page 219----->220
Vnr is increasing in λ n+1 σ 2µ , the variance of x n+1
δ Vn
≥ 0
δ σ 2µ

since

Vn = Max Vnr , V a − K

The uncertainty over the expectation of the excess-to-benchmark returns is measured
by the variance of µ which is a function of βn, αn and λn. These parameters therefore
combine to represent the uncertainty over the value that the manager can add to the
delegated portfolio.

The value of active management is increasing in this

uncertainty.
This proposition partially explains two questions arising from empirical research into
the flow of investors’ funds to and from investment management groups. Firstly, it
is found by Ippolito (1992), Brown, Harlow, Starks (1996), Goetzmann and Peles
(1997), Sirri and Tufano (1998) and others, that fund managers can return
persistently poor performance relative to their peers without experiencing large
outflows of money. These results have been explained in terms of high switching
costs, including the tax costs of realising capital gains. Nonetheless, relative to
perceived costs of changing manager, the poor performance that some investors
tolerate has no obvious full explanation in the literature.
The framework for analysing investors hiring and firing decisions presented here
recognises that a delay in the decision to switch managers may allow resolution of
some uncertainty over the manager’s quality. As in a real options framework, the
more uncertainty that can be resolved by delay the higher is the required return to the
new project (the worse the manager’s performance) before the new project is
initiated.
Secondly, this proposition partially explains an observation of Chevalier and Ellison
(1997a). They found that after controlling for size and for the performance of
managers, the growth rate of the funds managed by managers with shorter
performance histories is greater than equivalent managers with longer histories. A
shorter history equates to less prior information, which in this model is captured by a
lower value for l0. The greater uncertainty of the expected value of the excess-to-

<-----Page 220----->221

benchmark returns of the managers with shorter performance records makes them
more valuable to investors who discount excess-to-benchmark returns at the risk free
rate.
A final point relates to the entry of fund managers to the industry. The number of
fund managers entering (and exiting) the fund management industry is large particularly in the mutual fund industry. This observation may be partially explained
by the uncertainty about µ, the expected excess return for managers new to the
industry. Because investors are more uncertain about the new fund managers, and
since investors have the option to sack the manager at low cost and choose another,
relatively unknown managers may have a comparative advantage.

6.4.3 Proposition 3:
The value of active management is non decreasing in the shape parameter b0 of the
gamma-normal prior distribution or the sample variance of the excess return
observations.

The value of active management is non decreasing in the sample variance. This
result has significance for active managers who deliberately track the market index.
Index tracking can assure that the sample mean of excess-to-benchmark returns is
close to zero but it also reduces the sample variance which in turn reduces Vnr. A
manager that replicates the benchmark portfolio may be more likely to exceed xcn+1;
however, index tracking decreases the variance of their excess-to-benchmark returns,
which decreases Vnr and in turn increases xcn+1 .

<-----Page 221----->222

In this framework managers have an incentive to inject noise into their return to
increase the trustee board’s valuation. This idea is closely related to the Dow and
Gorton (1997) noise and volume argument. They argue that managers with no
information will undertake noise trading so that their lack of information is not
revealed in the short term.

6.4.4 Proposition 4:
The value of active management is decreasing in K, the cost of changing managers,
and not increasing in r the risk free interest rate.

A consequence of this result is that active investment managers may create
externalities for their industry if they increase costs of changing manager. The active
investment management industry competes with passive investment management for
funds. If investors can only estimate an industry value of K, rather than a manager

<-----Page 222----->223

specific value, then the externality may lead to higher costs of changing manager and
thereby the value of active management to investors is decreased relative to passive
management.
For example, when a portfolio is passed from a dismissed manager to a newly
appointed manager, the costs of trading to the new manager’s preferred portfolio
holdings is typically not attributed to either the old or new manager. For large
pension funds this unattributed cost may be the largest component of the cost of
changing manager. Because of the lack of attribution managers have little incentive
to minimise this cost, but the value of active management to an investor is strictly
decreasing in the investor’s estimate of this cost.
The relationship between the value of active management and the riskless rate simply
presents a testable implication of this model. In a large universe of managers, the
number of investors switching managers, over any short period, should be increasing
in r.

6.4.5 Proposition 5:
There is not a simple monotonic relationship between the value of active
management and either the volume of prior information, measured by l0, or the
volume of sample information, measured by n.

Vn is a function of µn and σn2. µn is a weighted average of x n the sample mean and
µ0 the prior mean. The weights are

λ
n
and 0 respectively. If x n > m0 then an
λn
λn

increase in n puts greater weight on the sample data. The same reasoning applies to
sn2 and

β0
. If the sample mean and variance are consistent with high value then
α 0λ 0

shifting weight to sample information increases Vnr. Both the sample mean and
variance are important.
This result characterises the simple idea that a larger number of observations of
performance is good news for managers whose performance has exceeded the
investor’s prior expectation of the manager’s average excess-to-benchmark return.
However, uncertainty over the mean of the manager’s excess-to-benchmark
distribution is also an important determinant of the manager’s value to the investor.
If more sample information increases the posterior expected value of m, but decreases
the uncertainty over m then the effect of n on Vn is ambiguous. Note that the same
reasoning applies to l0 because l0 and n enter the expression for Vnr symmetrically.

6.4.6 Stationarity and equilibrium
It is assumed here that the processes that generate the fund manager’s excess-tobenchmark returns are stationary. However, the assumption implies that the fund
manager does not react strategically as the vector of performance results evolves.
The fund manager will learn about the trustee board’s prior over the fund manager’s
excess return through: the initial fund manager selection process; the benchmarks
that are set; and the ongoing contact with the trustee board. Presumably the fund
manager will use an informed assumption about the trustee board’s prior to formulate
a strategic response.
A manager’s estimate of xcn+1 represents the size of the ‘bets’ that the manager can
afford to take. If a manager has a given level of information on the future realisation
of an asset price, then the quantity of that asset held will be a function of xcn+1. A
manager can take bets on specific assets and at the same time insure against a
portfolio return of less than xcn+1.

preclude the purchase of derivative securities. Instead, the manager can hedge by
dynamically adjusting the holding of the benchmark portfolio and individual assets as discussed in chapter 2.
The parameter stability assumption implies the existence of performance persistence.
There is not much evidence of performance persistence in the pension fund industry
(Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny 1992a, Brown, Draper and McKenzie 1997 and
Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbotson and Ross 1992). Performance persistence studies face
severe methodological problems in handling survivorship bias and risk adjustment.
If the excess return distributions of managers are stationary, then we might expect to
see a migration of pension funds from poor managers to good managers over time.
In the UK pension fund industry over the last 15 years, pension fund investment
mandates have become concentrated in the hands of the most successful investment
management firms. This observation is consistent with a degree of stationarity.

<-----Page 225----->226

6.4.7 Passive and active management
In the framework of this paper a passive manager can be characterised by

θindex = (µ , τ) = (0,0). ⇒

V0index = 0

Passive management provides a calibration of the value of active management. This
sets a lower bound on Va-K of -Kindex.

Each trustee board’s assessment of Va-K

determines their choice between active and passive management.
The trustee board depicted in figure 6.6 initially chooses active management even
though m0 < 0. This illustrates the point that a trustee board may choose active
management even if they do not expect on average to choose a manager with positive
µ.

Under the conditions of this model trustee boards which choose active

management do not rationally have to believe that they will on average choose a
manager who will beat the market - they just have to believe that they can hold on to
managers who do beat the market for longer. If the trustee board has a rational view
of the market then they must believe that they have higher than average ability to
choose a manager with a high µ. This is because over time active fund managers on
average have lower returns than passive managers (Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny
1992b, Brown, Draper and McKenzie 1996).
Little is known about the factors that determine the fraction of the total capitalisation
of a financial asset market that is under passive management. The figure must be
less than 100 percent to permit the rational formation of prices (Grossman and
Stiglitz 1980). However, the literature says little else. The framework presented
here partially characterises the equilibrium between passive and active management
(institutional or private). Trustee boards which believe that Va-K > -Kindex will see
another active manager as the best alternative to their current manager; otherwise
they will go to passive management when they change manager. As the volume of
passively managed funds rises, Va increases (in a Grossman Stiglitz world) - giving
rise to the equilibrium. Since 1986 the pension fund industry in the UK has seen

<-----Page 226----->227

both a slow drift of pension fund mandates to passive management and a narrowing
of the average returns of the active management and passive management sectors.

6.5

A simulation study

6.5.1.1 Purpose of the simulation
The two period model developed in section 6.3 yields a closed form solution for the
value of active management which in turn yields the propositions of section 6.4.
However, investors typically have horizons longer than two years. In the case of
trustee boards the investment horizon is often the duration of the liabilities: which for
a young workforce may be several decades.
The model cannot be extended by increasing the horizon without giving up either the
closed form nature of solutions or the gamma – normal Bayesian structure of the
model. A simpler Bayesian model may have a closed form, but such a model may be
too abstract to be of interest. The alternative to a closed form solution is a numerical
solution. In this section the results of numerical solution of the value of active
management for a trustee board with an investment horizon of 10 years are
presented.70
There are three objectives in this study. Firstly, to estimate the size of the option
effects for investors with longer horizons. The two period model indicates that
option effects exist but does not demonstrate that they have economic significance.
Secondly, to confirm the direction of the comparative static results set out in the
propositions of section 6.4. Thirdly, to determine the economic significance of each
of these comparative static results.
The numerical solution of the model of hiring and firing for differing parameter
values amounts to a simulation study of the model. That is not a substitute for
confronting the testable implications of the model with data. However, simulation is

70

My discussions with pension fund consultants indicated that 10 years is often chosen as the time to

the investment horizon in their simulation studies.

<-----Page 227----->228

useful and necessary to guide the formation of interesting testable implications
before proceeding with the task of collecting data for empirical testing.

6.5.1.2 Nature of simulation
The simulation proceeds by numerically solving the following equation.

Equation 6.27

1+ r

−∞

This is a discrete functional equation in V(.). The chosen values of α0, β0, λ0, m0, k, r
specify the prior distribution and the exogenous economic variables. The value of
the best alternative manager is calculated as V(0, 0 ,0), the initial value of the
existing manager. Recall that it is assumed here that the value of the best alternative
manager is invariant with time. A solution is a value of V(.) at each point in the state
space of points ( x , sn2, n). In this simulation the approximation to the full solution
is the values of V(.) at the points:

n =

1, 2, 3, ……., 20

x =

-0.100, -0.099, ……, 0,…….0.098, 0.099

sn2 =

0.0000, 0.0002,…...,0.0098

Therefore, the value of active management at 20 x 200 x 50 = 200,000 points are
estimated in each simulation. Those values are the source of data for the graphs and
tables presented in this section. The simulations compute the value of V( x , sn2, n)
for an investor who has an investment horizon of 10 years. For some situations a
longer horizon might be appropriate. However, the number of computations in the

<-----Page 228----->229

simulation increases as the square of the number of periods to the horizon. In any
case we know from the Bayesian structure of the model that the results will be
qualitatively similar for larger horizons.71

6.5.2 Simulation methodology
The simulation can proceed to a solution by solving for V( x , sn2, n) where the
horizon is one period. In that case V( x , sn2, n) = Max [mn/(1+r),(m0a-K(1+r))/(1+r)]
where m0a is the expected return from the best alternative manager over the one
period. Having solved for the one period values, the simulation can step back a
period and use the 200,000 values from the one period problem to calculate the
values for the two period horizon. Then the simulation iterates back another eight
times to reach the ten year horizon solution.
In each iteration for each of the 200,000 cells, the integral in equation 6.27 must be
evaluated. In this study, Montecarlo estimation of the integral was employed. For
each cell calculation a large number of independent draws are made from the student
t distribution of xn+1 that relates to that cell. The value in the next period that
corresponds to the draw is found and the values are averaged. This method appeals
to the law of large numbers to estimate the expectation of V(.) over the possible
values of the excess-to-benchmark return in the next period.

6.5.2.1 Calibration of the Montecarlo simulation
Two elements of the Montecarlo simulation are central to its accuracy. Firstly, the
range of the points calculated and the distance between those points.72 Secondly, the
number of draws in evaluation of the integral. To determine suitable values for these
quantities the Montecarlo simulation values can be calibrated against the closed form
solution from the two period model.

71

The number of computations required in the simulation if the reporting periods are quarters instead

of years is 16 times greater.
72

Outside the range the value is estimated by the upper asymptote for high sample mean values which

are outside the range of cells and Va-K for the low sample mean values which are outside the range of
cells.

<-----Page 229----->230

For the two period horizon case, the value of V( x , sn2, n) was calculated by both the
closed form equation of 6.24 and the Montecarlo method.

The results of this

calibration are depicted in figures 6.7 and 6.8. Figure 6.7 shows that the closed form
and Montecarlo values are co-incident. In the legend to that figure hor=2 means that
these results are for the two period horizon model. Draw = 5000 records that 5000
draws were made in the Montecarlo estimation.
Figure 6.8 depicts the value of the option component of Vnr (part 4 in equation 6.24),
as it varies with the sample mean. The different lines show the effect of increasing
the number of draws in the Montecarlo estimation technique. The results suggest
that the number of cells (200,000) is large enough and 1,000 draws is sufficient for
the Montecarlo method.73

6.5.3 Representative investor case
6.5.3.1 Parameter choices
The values of a0, b0, l0 and m0 determine the slope and location of the prior
distribution. In this simulation the parameters were chosen on the following basis.

α0
Values of a0 = 4 and b0=0.0016 were chosen to give an expected value
= E (t)
β0
of t of 2500 in the prior.

73

a0 = dof

A prior degree of freedom in the t distribution of xn+1 of 4 was chosen.
The choice of a0 also determines the variance of t which is a0/b02.

l0

Determines the weight that is given to prior information versus sample
information in forming the posterior distribution. The choice of l0 = 2
corresponds to a representative investor whose prior information is
equivalent to two observations (years) of sample information.

m0

In this simulation the representative investor is given a prior expected
value of m of 0.

This calibration also permits very accurate de-bugging of the simulation program which provides a

non trivial improvement in confidence in the simulation results.

<-----Page 230----->231

Figures 6.9 – 6.12 depict the value of active management to the representative trustee
board when the investment horizon is 10 years and the investment manager has been
employed for 3 years. Figure 6.9 shows the value of active management for the
representative trustee board for different values of the sample variance of excess-tobenchmark returns. It shows that V( x , sn2, n) is increasing in the sample variance.
In particular the figure demonstrates that the value of x at which the manager is
dismissed is decreasing in the sample variance.
Figure 6.9 shows the low and high asymptotes which Vnr approaches when the
sample mean of excess-to-benchmark returns is low or high respectively. Figure
6.10 shows the difference between Vnr and the asymptotes.

This difference

represents a part of the value of the option to delay the decision to dismiss the
manager by one or more periods. Figure 6.10 shows that part of the option value is
an increasing function of sn2. Much of the option value is captured by Va because the
option to change managers stills exists after a new manager is chosen.
Figure 6.11 exhibits the relationship between Vnr and the number of observations of
the excess-to-benchmark return. Clearly there is not a single monotonic relationship
between the volume of sample information and the value of active management. The
position of the asymptotes is dependent upon n. Nonetheless, figure 6.12 shows that
the height of Vnr above the asymptotes (the option value not captured in Va) is a
decreasing function of n. That option value is increasing in the level of uncertainty
over m, which is decreasing in n.

6.5.4 Uncertainty over the expected value of excess-to-benchmark returns
Tables 6.1 and 6.2 and figures 6.13 and 6.14 depict the effect of the level of
uncertainty over m on the value of active management.
σ 2µ =

The variance of m is

βn
. In the simulations for this sub-section the effect of varying sm2 was
λn αn

studied by varying b0 and keeping the initial degrees of freedom (a0) and the weight
on prior information (l0) constant.
The middle row of each of the following cases presents data for the representative
investor, as discussed in the previous section.

Table 6.1 shows that for the

representative investor the minimum value of x at which the manager is dismissed at
the decision date is decreasing in sn2. The value falls 50 basis points between sn2 =
0.0002 and sn2 = 0.0050.
For higher and lower values of uncertainty over m, this range is much the same.
However, table 6.1 shows that the critical value of x at which the investor is
indifferent between retention or dismissal is decreasing in b0. Investors with high
values of b0, that is, high uncertainty over the value of m, will accept a lower sample
mean of excess-to-benchmark returns before dismissing the manager.

Another

important effect of varying sm2 is to shift the value of the alternative manager and
hence the value of active management. This is particularly apparent in table 6.2
which shows the value of active management for different values of b0 and sn2 when

x = 0.

6.5.5 Level of prior information
Simulation results are presented in tables 6.3 and 6.4 and figures 6.15 and 6.16 where
weight on the prior information versus sample information is varied, with other
parameters held constant. Higher values of l0 are consonant with giving more
weight to the prior information in the formation of the posterior distribution. The
critical value of x for which the investor is indifferent between retention and
dismissal is decreasing in the weight placed on prior information. Moreover at x =0
the value of active management is strongly decreasing in the weight put on prior
information.

6.5.6 Effect of the cost of changing manager
Tables 6.5 and 6.6 and figures 6.17 and 6.18 depict the effect of the cost of changing
fund manager on the value of active management. It is clear from table 6.6 that the
value of active management is falling in the cost of changing manager. However, the
reduction in value is less than the increase in cost. Comparing the columns of table
6.6, the results suggest that the ratio of decrease in value of active management to
increase in cost of changing is increasing with the sample variance. Thus, the more
likely it is that a change is required, the larger the effect of K on V(.).

Table 6.5 suggests, as expected, that investors will accept a lower value of x before
changing manager when the cost of changing manager is higher.

6.5.7 Effect of the risk free rate
Tables 6.7 and 6.8 and figures 6.19 and 6.20 depict the effect of the cost of changing
fund manager on the value of active management. Table 6.7 indicates that investors
will accept lower values of x before dismissing a manager when interest rates are
high. The future payoffs to switching managers is lower when interests rates are
higher.

However, the value of active management is strongly decreasing with

increased interest rates at a sample mean of 0. In this framework active management
is less valuable when interest rates are high but nonetheless investors have less
incentive to change managers.

Testable implications and future research

The model of investors hiring and firing decisions that is presented here has a
number of testable implications. It is my intention to confront a subset of these
implications of the model with UK pension fund data in future research.
Implication 1

Other things equal, investors will more highly value investment

managers that have shorter observable investment histories because investors’
valuation of active management is increasing in uncertainty over the value of µ.
Therefore, other things equal, more money will flow to managers with shorter
observable investment histories. Further, we can expect to see that, of the pension
fund managers which are dismissed by trustee boards, managers with shorter
observable investment histories sustain lower levels of performance before being
dismissed. These implications could be tested using pension fund or mutual fund
data. Both sources are available in the US and the UK.
The first implication requires an estimation of a model of the flows of new money to
fund managers. In that estimation one of the explanatory variables would be the age
of the fund, or another proxy for the level of investors’ prior uncertainty over the
-to-benchmark return distribution. The discussion of
the literature on the strengths and weaknesses of existing fund manager performanceflow studies can guide the design of the model of portfolio flows. The second
implication, regarding the level of performance preceding dismissal, can be tested
directly by regression of performance at dismissal on the proxy for uncertainty over
the mean of excess-to-benchmark returns. Lunde, Timmermann and Blake (1998)
investigate the hazard function of mutual funds using semi-parametric technique.
Implication 2

The sample mean of the manager’s excess return at the date of

dismissal will be decreasing in sample variance because Vn is increasing in sn2. This
implication is the sample data version of the second of the implications above.
Again a direct test from pension fund data should be feasible.

<-----Page 244----->245

Implication 3

Other things equal, the volume of money managed by managers

which impose low costs of changing manager will be higher. The observable costs
of changing manager would include redemption charges of mutual funds. Data on
the charges of UK unit trusts and US mutual funds is available. The test involves
estimating a model of the asset size of different unit trusts. In that model one of the
explanatory variables is level of entry and exit charges.
Implication 4

The sample mean of the manager’s excess return at the date of

dismissal will be decreasing in the cost of changing manager. In this case, different
asset classes might proxy for the cost of changing manager. The portfolio changes
arising from a change in small capitalisation stock manager will create larger
transaction costs than the portfolio changes associated with a change of large
capitalisation stock manager.
Implication 5

The proportion of new funds that flow to passive managers will be

increasing in the level of the riskless rate of interest and decreasing in the costs of
changing managers. These implications can be tested cross-sectionally and across
time using UK unit trust or US mutual fund data.

6.7

Concluding remarks on the hiring and firing model

The model of hiring and firing of pension fund managers and the associated
simulation study are motivated by a desire to understand how the decisions of
investors, regarding which fund manager to choose and whether to retain that
manager, affect the equilibrium in asset markets. Investors’ decisions on dismissal
can help us to understand the downside risk that fund managers face from poor
portfolio performance results. As argued in chapter 2, an understanding of fund
manager incentives is crucial in studying the market equilibrium.
Empirical studies find that significant poor under-performance by fund managers
may be sustained before the volume of funds under management decreases
substantially. In the model presented here, that observation is explained by the
positive value of the option to delay the decision to dismiss the manager.

<-----Page 245----->246

In the two period model, the value of active management can be broken down into
four components, one of which is the option to decide next period, rather than this
period, whether to dismiss the manager. The simulation of the value of active
management to an investor with an investment horizon of 10 periods shows that this
option value is not trivial. The simulation draws out the crucial role of the level of
uncertainty over the expected value of the manager’s excess return distribution. In
the simulation the difference between a high prior level of uncertainty and a low
prior level is nearly 500 basis points in the value of the manager, and 110 basis
points in the sample mean of excess-to-benchmark returns before the manager is
dismissed. For a longer horizon these values would be commensurately larger.
This level of uncertainty over µ is also increasing in the sample variance of excessto-benchmark returns, which has implications for the incentives of fund managers
who are approaching performance levels at which investors are considering
dismissal.
The model highlights the role of the cost of changing manager in the decisions of
investors. The simulation shows the value of active management decreasing in the
cost of changing managers with a sensitivity of less than one. The model also
potentially provides insights into the role of the cost of changing manager in the
balance between the total volume of funds under active versus passive management.
Individual managers who have performed poorly do not have the same incentives as
highly performed managers to minimise the costs to their investors of changing
manager. Since the value of active management, unlike passive management, is
decreasing in the cost of changing manager, there is a negative externality associated
with these costs.

Chapter 7 Concluding Remarks
This thesis is concerned with the decisions of private investors and institutional fund
managers.

It is contended here that private and institutional investors are

fundamentally different in at least one way – they face different incentives. Further,
that we expect the decisions taken by private and institutional investors to reflect this
difference. In turn, we expect the difference in those decisions to be reflected in
financial market outcomes.

The research presented here demonstrates that the

differences in the decisions of private investors and fund managers are substantial
and explain outcomes observed in financial markets.
The organising principle for this study of the decisions of investors and their fund
managers is the familiar starting point of all microeconomic analysis - the
maximisation problem faced by economic agents. In the rise of delegated portfolio
management essay, the questions are: how large is delegated portfolio management?;
how did the rise of institutional fund management come about?; what do we know
about the differences between the incentives, and hence optimisation problems, faced
by private investors and fund managers?; and what can be explained by studying
these differences?
In the accuracy of herding measures essay, the questions proceed from the view that
the differences in incentives are important: if we believe that private investors and
institutional investors form two groups that are fundamentally different in their
trading, then how do we test that belief? A body of empirical literature finds that
fund managers form a herd separate to the rest of the market (private investors), but
how do we know that the measures of herding are accurate? More generally, how do
we test whether any particular measure which is derived from portfolio holdings is
accurate; and can we generalise the findings of studies of herding by US fund
managers to the behaviour of managers in other comparable markets?
The hiring and firing of fund managers essay, is motivated by unanswered questions
about investors’ decisions and fund managers’ incentives: how can the portfolio
performance of managers who are fired be characterised?; what does the attrition rule
mean for the downside of the incentive schedule faced by fund managers?; what is it

<-----Page 247----->248

that makes investors choose to delegate portfolio management when the average
manager under-performs obtainable market indexes?; and how do the hiring and
firing decisions of investors aggregate to create observed dynamics in the investment
management industry?
The contribution of the first essay is an analysis of the significance of the transfer of
control of a large part of the financial asset market from households to institutional
investors. The first point addressed is the scale of the transfer of financial assets
from households to professionally managed portfolios. It is important to bring out in
clear terms what a massive change has occurred in the control of assets and financial
intermediation in the US and UK. The figures themselves beg the question ‘what
does this mean for financial markets?’
Once the data is presented it becomes clear what is driving the shift to delegated
portfolio management in the US, the growth in pension money managed by
institutional investors. The transition of household ownership of US equities from 69
percent of the market in 1969 to 41 percent at year end 1998 is explained largely by
three structural ownership changes. State and local government employee funds
have taken their holding of US equities from near zero to over 10 percent of the
market as their assets grew to 28 percent of GDP and their US equity allocation grew
to 62 percent, between 1967 and 1998. Private pension fund holdings have increased
from 6 to 14 percent of the US equity market in the same period. US mutual funds
held 4 percent of the US equity market in 1983, 7 percent in 1990 and 16 percent in
1998.
For researchers of financial asset markets, the historical perspective of the rise of
portfolio management is important. If the level of institutional ownership affects
market outcomes then it should be recognised that important empirical finance
studies span the period in which the level of institutional ownership is changing
rapidly. As far as I can tell, the possible mis-specification of these studies has not
been recognised elsewhere.
The first essay then analyses what is known and not known about fund manager
incentives. The papers that relate to fund manager incentives are first identified from

<-----Page 248----->249

disparate parts of the literature. Some evidence is drawn from studies that address
psychological issues of rationality, cognitive dissonance and reaction to quality
shocks, but nonetheless provide analysis of the flow of funds to managers. The
conflicting results from the studies of funds flows are subjected to two tests. Firstly,
that the econometrics of the study is sound and secondly, that the results make sense
in the framework of the fund manager’s optimisation problem. This is a crucial step
for the thesis.

This analysis characterises what is known about fund manager

incentives.
The incentive schedule of a fund manager relates end of period wealth, or firm value,
to fund rank or the excess-to-benchmark return of the manager. The schedule is
convex in out-performance and concave in under-performance. The schedule shows
that there is little gain to portfolio performance that is only slightly better than that of
peer fund managers. The rewards of new money flow to managers with the highest
return ranking.

The schedule is not symmetric in that funds can have poor

performance and not lose much money. The relationship between end of period
wealth (y axis) and relative portfolio performance (x axis) is not as concave in poor
performance as it is convex in high performance.
The incentive schedule of a private investor is a linear relationship between portfolio
total return, or excess-to-benchmark return, and end of period wealth. Therein lies
the essential difference between the incentives of private investors and fund
managers.

There are two immediate implications of this difference that can be

understood in terms of the incentive schedule. Firstly, assume that a fund manager
wishes to maximise the expected utility of wealth E[u(w{rpt-rmt})] . The expectation
operator is linear, the utility function of wealth is concave and wealth is convex in
positive excess return and concave in negative excess return.74
Under these circumstances fund managers will value assets with positive skewness.75
The testable implications of this conjecture are manifold and can form the basis of
74

This statement is a simplification because the location of the inflexion point of the schedule depends

upon past performance of the fund.
75

In fact managers will have a preference for all positive values of all the odd moments, 1st, 3rd, 5th,….

<-----Page 249----->250

ongoing research. For example we should expect to see fund managers’ holdings of
assets with positive skewness to be greater than that of private investors. Such assets
would include initial public offering stocks and deeply out of the money options.
The second implication of the nature of the incentive schedule is as follows. Assume
that the end of period wealth of a fund manager is a function of excess return over a
window of say three years. Then each year the performance of four years ago drops
out and last year’s performance is inserted. That change in the window shifts the
schedule to the left or the right. That shift leads to a new optimal portfolio. This is a
form of dynamic hedging which may have profound implications. For instance, say
one manager owns none of stock A that is 2 percent of the index and another
manager holds 4 percent of the stock and the stock goes up 150 percent. The
dynamic hedging response will not be symmetric. As the stock rises the manager
who is short versus the market will be induced to buy but the other manager may also
be induced to buy. The relationship between such asymmetric hedging and serial
correlation in stock prices can be investigated in future research.
A testable implication of the conjecture that private investors and fund managers
have substantially different incentives is that, as groups, they will hold significantly
different aggregate portfolios.

As they change those portfolios in response to

changes in variables that affect the two differently, we should expect to see net trade
between them which appears as herding by the groups.
Previous studies provide evidence of herding by mutual fund managers and pension
fund managers in the US. But the measures employed in those studies are founded
on assumptions that are invalid but crucial for the accuracy of the measures. This
problem is not unique to measures of herding. Unfortunately, it is standard practice
in much of empirical finance, and especially investment management studies, to
devise a metric and then simply assume that the metric will return a value of zero in
the absence of the phenomenon being measured. Yet, in most of these studies
researchers could simulate datasets, in which the phenomenon is absent, to
empirically estimate the sampling distribution of the metric under null conditions.

<-----Page 250----->251

An alternative to testing the existing herding measures is to devise a new measure of
herding. The testing approach was chosen for two reasons. Firstly, tests of the
accuracy of the extant measures can help determine whether existing empirical
studies of herding are soundly based. Secondly, the attempt to create measures of
herding that encompass all the phenomena that are considered to be herding is part of
the problem with herding measures. That approach has led to measures that do not
have well defined alternative hypotheses. A much better approach is to identify
separate testable predictions for each of the theoretical explanations of herding and
then devise separate tests for each prediction. This is the approach that shall be taken
in ongoing research on fund manager herding.
The contribution of this essay can be summarised as follows.

Firstly, the

mathematical description of different types of herding is defined and it is shown that
the major explanations of herding all arise from the same source - fund managers
solve similar optimisation problems. The analysis of explanations of herding in an
optimisation framework presented here hopefully will help to clarify the discussion
of herding.
Secondly, a methodology is developed for estimating the sampling distribution of
any metric which is derived from portfolio holdings data. Researchers can employ a
version of this methodology to test the accuracy of a metric on any portfolio holdings
dataset. There is no need to simply assume that a metric is well calculated. Thirdly,
the accuracy of the existing measures of herding is tested, and the types of stocks for
which these measures are inaccurate, in the UK dataset, are identified. It is found
that the LSV measure overstates the level of herding in small capitalisation stocks
and stocks traded by a small number of managers as a result of the invalid short sales
assumption. The Wermers measure of herding is found to be substantially misspecified. The caveats associated with this general test of the model should be
reiterated here. We cannot be sure that the all herding was eliminated in re-sampling
procedure of the test. The re-sampled datasets do not maintain all the essential
characteristics of the actual dataset and the number of re-sampled datasets is finite.
Finally, the existing measures are adjusted for estimated inaccuracy and a significant
level of herding among UK equity unit trust managers is recorded. The level of

<-----Page 251----->252

herding found is commensurate with 14 managers buying or 12 managers selling
where 20 managers trade a stock during a period.76

A large amount of herding by

UK unit trust managers in the smallest market capitalisation stocks is found.
Curiously, that herding is almost entirely herding in buying of the small stocks.
It is difficult to judge the economic significance of these figures. For two reasons we
should not expect to observe ratios of managers trading in the same direction that
approach unity. Firstly, the household sector in the UK holds only 22 percent of the
UK equity market. Therefore the household sector cannot absorb a great deal of
correlated trading from managers. Secondly, if fund managers herd in their trading
of a stock then resultant trading pressure will move the price in the direction that
weakens the force which originally created the herding. For instance, if a large
number of managers buy in concert because they observe a manager who is
perceived to be informed buying the stock, then we can expect the price of the stock
to rise, which in turn induces some managers to sell.
Ongoing research in herding can take two directions.

The first, as previously

mentioned, is to identify separate testable predictions from the major theoretical
explanations of herding and test them. A test of the correlated information theory of
herding is afforded by the overlapping nature of the UK unit trust dataset. Fund
managers who report in the January-July cycle overlap managers in the FebruaryAugust cycle by five months and managers in the March-September cycle by four
months and so on. By the correlated information hypothesis, the smaller the overlap
period between funds, the less the herding that should be found between them.
Preliminary tests show that the UK portfolio holdings data does support the
correlated trading explanation of herding.
The hiring and firing essay presents results that have the pleasing quality of being
unanticipated when the study began. The first motivation for the study was a need to
better understand the process by which investors decide when to dismiss a poor
performing manager and then which alternative manager to choose. The intention
was to better understand the downside risk faced by managers, by modelling the
76

The difference arises because in the absence of herding, on average 11.6 managers would buy.

<-----Page 252----->253

events leading up to dismissal. Further, to understand aspects of the structure of the
investment management industry, such as the balance between active and passive
management and the concentration of pension fund mandates with only a few of the
largest managers, by studying the hiring and firing decisions of individual investors.
The hiring and firing essay of chapters 5 and 6 contributes to the understanding of
these questions and addresses other questions which were not part of the original
motivation. The principle contributions are twofold. Firstly, to recognise that the
investor has a sequence of real options to delay the project of firing the manager.
Secondly, to understand the dynamic programming nature of the investor’s hiring
and firing decision.
The value of the real option explains some investor behaviour that otherwise seems
incongruous. It partially explains observations of empirical studies of funds flows
that were reviewed in the rise of delegated portfolio management essay. Ippolito
(1992), Goetzmann and Peles (1997) and Sirri and Tufano (1998) find that investor
reaction to poor portfolio performance does not mirror their reaction to high returns.
In many instances investors do not leave poor performing funds at a great rate. This
observation is explained in part by the omission of the worst performing funds from
datasets because they merge with other funds. Another explanation is that investors
are trapped by the high cost of changing manager, including the cost of realising
capital gains. The additional cost recognised in the hiring and firing essay is the cost
of relinquishing the option to delay the costly project of changing manager until the
arrival of information that reduces uncertainty over the decision.
The real option also partially explains the observation of Ippolito (1992) and
Chevalier and Ellison (1997a) that, after controlling for size and portfolio
performance, more money flows to a fund with a two year history than a fund with a
ten year track record. For the two year manager, other things equal, waiting one
more period before deciding on dismissal resolves more uncertainty about the
manager’s ability. Therefore the option to wait is more valuable. The greater
uncertainty in the posterior distribution over the mean of the excess-to-benchmark
return distribution of the two year manager gives the real option associated with that
manager a higher value.

<-----Page 253----->254

The dynamic programming nature of the investor’s problem comes about because the
investor must choose another manager if the current manager is fired. This gives the
model the real world property that the investor expects to hire a sequence of
managers over time. Then we have the result that an investor may choose active
management even when the investor’s prior expectation is that the mean of the
chosen manager’s excess return distribution is negative. The intuition here is that if
an investor on average holds on to good managers for longer than bad managers, then
even if the average manager’s average return is negative, the investor’s time
weighted return can be positive.

Therefore, the model partially explains why

investors choose active management when studies show that the average manager
under-performs the market index.
The next step in the study of investors’ hiring and firing decisions is to draw out the
testable implications of the hiring and firing model and confront them with a real
dataset of these decisions.
In the most general terms, this thesis has sought to document the rise of delegated
portfolio management and analyse the significance of this structural change in
financial markets; examine evidence of whether private investors and institutional
investors really are fundamentally different in their trading behaviour; and finally go
to the point of contact between investors and fund managers and investigate the
nature of investor choice decisions and its meaning for fund manager incentives and
market outcomes.

The results of this research have, hopefully, progressed the

understanding of the significance of the differences in incentives faced by private
investors and fund managers.
