Abstract
This paper uses a three-games (or triadic) design to identify trusting and reciprocating behavior.
A large literature on single-game trust and reciprocity experiments is based on the implicit
assumption that subjects do not have altruistic or inequality-averse other-regarding preferences. Such
experimental designs test compound hypotheses that include the hypothesis that other-regarding
preferences do not affect behavior. In contrast, experiments with the triadic design do discriminate
between transfers resulting from trust or reciprocity and transfers resulting from other-regarding
preferences that are not conditional on the behavior of others. Decomposing trust from altruism and
reciprocity from altruism or inequality aversion is critical to obtaining empirical information that can
guide the process of constructing models that can increase the empirical validity of game theory.

1. Introduction
In their seminal work on game theory, von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944, 1947)
thought it necessary to simultaneously develop a theory of utility and a theory of play for
strategic games. In contrast, much subsequent development of game theory has focused on
analyzing the play of games to the exclusion of utility theory. In the absence of a focus
by game theorists on utility theory, it is understandable that experimentalists testing the
theory’s predictions have typically assumed that agents’ utilities are affine transformations
of (only) their own monetary payoffs in the games. This interpretation of game theory
incorporates the assumptions that agents do not care about others’ (relative or absolute)

material payoffs or about their intentions. There is a large experimental literature based
on this special-case interpretation of the theory, which I shall subsequently refer to as the
model of “self-regarding preferences.” The part of the literature concerned with public
goods experiments and trust and reciprocity experiments has produced replicable patterns
of inconsistency with predictions of the model of self-regarding preferences. For example,
the patterns of behavior that have been observed in one-shot trust and reciprocity games
are inconsistent with the subgame perfect equilibria of that model. But this does not imply
that the observed behavior is inconsistent with game theory, which is a point that has not
generally been recognized in the literature.
In one prominent research program, the central empirical question has been posed
as a contest between game theory and alternative theories based on ideas of cultural or
biological evolution.1 For example, McCabe et al. (1998) pose the question as follows:
Our objective is to examine game theoretic hypotheses of decision making based on
dominance and backward induction in comparison with the culturally or biologically
derived hypothesis that reciprocity supports more cooperation than predicted by game
theory (p. 10). . .
and state their conclusion as
Contrary to noncooperative game theory, but consistent with the reciprocity hypothesis,
many subjects achieve the symmetric joint maximum under the single play anonymous
interaction conditions that are expected to give game theory its best shot (p. 22).
Another distinguished research program has focused on inconsistencies between the
predictions of principal-agent theory and behavior in experimental labor markets.2 For
example, Fehr et al. (1997, p. 856) conclude that
Our results indicate, however, that the neglect of reciprocity may render principal agent
models seriously incomplete. As a consequence it may limit their predictive power.
Moreover, the normative conclusions that follow from models that neglect reciprocity
may not be correct.
Widely-disseminated conclusions about robust observations of trust and reciprocity
have motivated developments of utility theory intended to improve the empirical validity
of game theory. For example, Rabin (1993) and Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2001)
have developed models that incorporate perceptions of others’ intentions into the utilities
of game players. In contrast, Levine (1998), Fehr and Schmidt (1999), and Bolton and
Ockenfels (2000) have developed models that incorporate other-regarding preferences (or
fairness) into game players’ utilities. Models that incorporate both intentions and fairness
1 The research program includes the following papers: Berg et al. (1995), Hoffman et al. (1994, 1996, 1998),
McCabe et al. (1996, 1998), and Smith (1998).
2 The research program includes the following papers: Fehr and Falk (1999), Fehr and Gächter (2000a, 2000b),
Fehr et al. (1993, 1996, 1997).

have been developed by Falk and Fischbacher (1999), Charness and Rabin (forthcoming),
and Cox and Friedman (2002). But there is a problem with the widely-disseminated
conclusions about behavior that are motivating these theory developments: the conclusions
are not all supported by the experimental designs that generated the data.
The present paper re-examines some central questions in the literature on trust and
reciprocity. It specifically questions the widely-accepted conclusion stated in a recent
survey article by Fehr and Gächter (2000b, p. 162):
Positive reciprocity has been documented in many trust or gift exchange games (for
example, Fehr et al., 1993; Berg et al., 1995; McCabe et al., 1996).
The conclusion that positive reciprocity is “documented” by data showing that many
proposers send, and responders give back money in trust and gift exchange games is not
supported by the experimental designs in the cited papers. The source of the difficulty is
that the single-game experimental designs used to generate the data in these experiments
do not discriminate between actions motivated by trust or reciprocity and actions motivated
by other-regarding preferences characterized by altruism or inequality aversion that is not
conditional on the behavior of others. In the present paper, a triadic experimental design
is used to discriminate between transfers resulting from trust or reciprocity and transfers
resulting from other-regarding preferences that are not conditional on the behavior of
another. This discrimination is based on dictator games that give a first or “second mover”
the same feasible choices as in the original game but eliminate the possible effects of the
(observed or anticipated) actions of the other agent. Being able to discriminate between
the implications of unconditional other-regarding preferences and trust or reciprocity is
important to obtaining the empirical information that can guide the process of formulating
a theory of utility that can increase the empirical validity of game theory.

2. Definitions
Interpretations of data in this paper will be based on the following definitions.
Preferences over one’s own and others’ material payoffs will be referred to as “otherregarding preferences.” Such preferences can be altruistic (Andreoni and Miller, 2002; Cox
et al., 2002), inequality-averse (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000; Fehr and Schmidt, 1999),
quasi-maximin (Charness and Rabin, forthcoming), or possibly even malevolent. They
involve ideas of the fairness of outcomes. Let y k and y j denote the money payoffs of
agents k and j . Assume that agent k’s preferences can be represented by a utility function.
Then agent k has other-regarding preferences for the income of agent j if his or her utility
function, uk (y k , y j ) is not a constant function of y j .
It is important to distinguish between actions motivated by reciprocity and actions
motivated by conventional other-regarding preferences that are not conditional on the
actions or intentions of others because they have different implications for game-theoretic
modeling. The concept of positive reciprocity used in this paper is defined as follows.
“Positive reciprocity” is a motivation to repay generous or helpful actions of another
by adopting actions that are generous or helpful to the other person. An action that is

<-----Page 3----->J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

263

positively reciprocal is a generous action that is adopted in response to a generous action
by another. Thus, positively reciprocal behavior is conditional kindness that is distinct
from the unconditional kindness motivated by altruism. An individual who behaves in a
reciprocal way makes decisions that can be modeled with other-regarding preferences that
are conditional on the perceived intentions behind the actions of others, as in Section 4 and
Appendix A.
Suppose that the first mover in an extensive form game chooses an action that benefits
the second mover. Further suppose that, subsequently, the second mover adopts an action
that benefits the first mover. Is the second mover’s action motivated by reciprocity
or unconditional other-regarding preferences characterized by altruism or inequality
aversion? Section 5 explains how the triadic experimental design discriminates between
reciprocity and unconditional other-regarding preferences as explanations for generous
second-mover actions.
“Trust” is inherently a matter of the beliefs that one agent has about the behavior of
another. An action that is trusting of another is one that creates the possibility of mutual
benefit, if the other person is cooperative, and the risk of loss to oneself if the other person
defects. If the first mover in an extensive form game believes that the second mover may
have other-regarding preferences, or be motivated by positive reciprocity, then the first
mover may make an efficiency-increasing transfer to the second mover. The first mover
may do this, even if he himself has self-regarding preferences, when he believes that the
second mover is unlikely to defect, that is, if he trusts the second mover.
Suppose that the first mover in an extensive form game chooses an action that benefits
the second mover. Does the first mover do this because she trusts that the second mover
will not defect? Or would she do it anyway because she has other-regarding preferences in
which the pair of payoffs created by her action is preferred to the pair of payoffs determined
by the two players’ endowments? Section 5 explains how the triadic experimental design
discriminates between trust and other-regarding preferences as explanations for generous
first-mover actions.
The experimental design described in Section 4 involves game triads that include the
investment game introduced by Berg et al. (1995) and later used by several other authors.

3. The investment game
The Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe experimental design for the investment game is as
follows. Subjects are divided into two groups, the room A group and the room B group.
Each individual subject in each group is given ten $1 bills. Each subject in room B is
instructed to keep his or her $10. The subjects in room A are informed that each of them,
individually, can transfer to an anonymous paired person in room B any integer number of
their own ten $1 bills, from 0 to all 10, and keep the remainder. Any amount transferred by
a room A subject is multiplied by 3 by the experimenter before being delivered to a room
B subject. Then each room B subject is given the opportunity to return part, all, or none of
the tripled amount of the transfer he or she received from the anonymous paired person in
room A.

<-----Page 4----->264

J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

If one assumes that subjects have self-regarding preferences, then game theory predicts
that:
(i) room B subjects will keep all of any tripled amounts transferred by room A subjects
because room B subjects prefer more money to less; and
(ii) knowing this, room A subjects will not transfer any positive amount.
This subgame perfect equilibrium allocation of the model of self-regarding preferences
is Pareto-inferior to some alternative feasible allocations because it leaves each pair of
subjects with $20 when it could have ended up with as much as $40.
Results from investment-game experiments reported by Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe
were that the average amount transferred by room A subjects was $5.16 and the average
amount returned by room B subjects was $4.66. When data from this experiment were
provided to subjects in a subsequent experiment (the “social history” treatment), the
average amount transferred by room A subjects was $5.36 and the average amount returned
was $6.46. There was large variability across subjects in the amounts transferred and
returned. The experiments reported by Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe used a “double
blind” protocol in which subjects’ responses were anonymous to other subjects and the
experimenters.
Note what is measured by these experiments. A room A subject may be willing to
transfer money to a room B person if he trusts that some of the tripled amount transferred
will be returned. Further, a room B subject may be willing to return part of the tripled
amount transferred if she is motivated by positive reciprocity. But a room A subject may
be willing to make a transfer to a paired subject in room B even if there is no opportunity for
the latter to return anything. The Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe experimental design does
not allow one to distinguish between transfers resulting from trust and transfers resulting
from altruistic other-regarding preferences. Similarly, their design does not provide data
that distinguish between second-mover return transfers motivated by reciprocity and
returns resulting from unconditional other-regarding preferences. The experimental design
used in the present paper makes it possible to discriminate among transfers motivated by
trust, reciprocity, and unconditional other-regarding preferences.

4. Experimental design and procedures
The experiment involves three treatments implemented in an across-subjects design.
Treatment A is the investment game. Each individual in the second-mover group is credited
with a $10 endowment. Each individual in the first-mover group is credited with a $10
endowment and given the task of deciding whether she wants to transfer to a paired
individual in the other group none, some, or all of her $10. Any amounts transferred are
tripled by the experimenter. Then each individual in the second-mover group is given the
task of deciding whether he wants to return some, all, or none of the tripled number of
certificates he received to the paired individual in the other group.

<-----Page 5----->J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

265

Treatment B is a dictator game that differs from treatment A only in that the individuals
in the “second-mover” group do not have a decision to make; thus they do not have an
opportunity to return any tokens that they receive.
Treatment C involves a decision task that differs from treatment A as follows. First,
the “first movers” do not have a decision to make. Each “second mover” is given a $10
endowment. “First movers” are given endowments in amounts equal to the amounts kept
(i.e., not sent) by the first movers in treatment A. Furthermore, the “second movers” in
treatment C are given additional dollar amounts equal to the amounts received by second
movers in treatment A from the tripled amounts sent by the first movers in treatment A.
The subjects are informed with a table of the exact inverse relation between the number of
additional dollars received by a “second mover” and the endowment of the anonymouslypaired “first mover.”
The experiment sessions are run manually (i.e., not with computers). The payoff
procedure is double blind:
(i) subject responses are identified only by letters that are private information of the
subjects; and
(ii) monetary payoffs are collected in private from sealed envelopes contained in lettered
mailboxes.
Double blind payoffs are implemented by having each subject draw a sealed envelope
containing a lettered key from a box containing many envelopes. At the end of the
experiment, the subjects use their keys to open lettered mailboxes that contain their
monetary payoffs in sealed envelopes. The experimenter is not present in the mailbox
room when the subjects collect their payoff envelopes. There is no interaction between
the experimenter and the subjects during decision-making parts of an experiment session.
All distribution and collection of envelopes containing subject response forms is done by
a “monitor” who is randomly selected from the subject pool in the presence of all of the
subjects.
All of the above design features are common information given to the subjects except for
one item. The subjects in treatment C are not informed that the inversely-related amounts
of the endowment of the “first mover” and additional certificates of the “second mover” are
determined by subjects’ decisions in treatment A.3 The subject instructions and response
forms do not use the terms “first mover” and “second mover” to refer to the two groups of
subjects; instead, the terms “group X” and “group Y” are used. The subjects are assigned
randomly to group X and group Y. There were six experiment sessions, two per treatment.
No subject participated in more than one experiment session. There were 30 pairs of
subjects in treatment B and 32 pairs of subjects in each of treatments A and C.
All of the experiment sessions end with each subject being paid an additional $5 for
filling out a questionnaire. First movers and second movers have distinct questionnaires.
The questions asked have three functions:
3 This procedure is followed in order to avoid any possible suggestion of indirect reciprocity (Dufwenberg

et al., 2001) to the second movers, which would consist of repaying “first mover” Cj , in treatment C, for the
friendly action of first mover Aj , in treatment A.

<-----Page 6----->266

(i) to provide additional data;
(ii) to provide a check for possible subject confusion about the decision tasks; and
(iii) to provide checks for possible recording errors by the experimenters and counting
errors by the subjects.
Subjects do not write their names on the questionnaires. The additional data provided
by the questionnaires include the subjects’ reports of their payoff key letters. Data error
checks provided by the questionnaires come from asking the subjects to report the numbers
of dollar certificates transferred, received, and returned. These reports, together with two
distinct records kept by the experimenters, provide accuracy checks on data recording.
Subjects were recruited with a standardized e-mail message from a computerized database of students that had volunteered to participate in experiments by registering on the web
site of the Economic Science Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Some of the subjects
had participated in previous economics experiments. The computerized database records
the types of experiments that subjects participate in. This information was used to filter subjects that had previously participated in experiments similar to ones reported here from the
recruitment e-mail list. Except for this filter, subjects were randomly selected from the database. At the beginning of an experiment session, the subjects were required to show student
photo identification cards, print their names on a sign-in form, and write their signatures
on the form. Inspection of the sign-in forms verifies that there was no repeat participation.

5. Discriminating between other-regarding preferences and trust or reciprocity
Treatment B differs from treatment A only in that the “second movers” do not have a
decision to make; thus they do not have an opportunity to return any part of the tripled
amounts sent to them. Since “second movers” cannot return anything in treatment B,
first movers cannot be motivated by trust that they will do so. In contrast, in treatment
A the first movers may be motivated to send positive amounts by both trust and altruistic
other-regarding preferences. Thus conclusions about whether first-mover transfers in the
investment game (treatment A) are partially motivated by trust are based on the difference
between treatments A and B in the amounts of money sent by first movers to second
movers.
Since “first movers” cannot send anything in treatment C, “second movers” cannot
be motivated by positive reciprocity, that is, a need to repay a friendly action by a first
mover. In contrast, in treatment A, second movers can be motivated to return positive
amounts by reciprocity or by unconditional other-regarding preferences. Thus conclusions
about whether second-mover transfers in the investment game are partially motivated by
reciprocity are based on the difference between treatments A and C in the amounts of
money returned by second movers to first movers.
As with any data, one needs a maintained theoretical model to interpret the data from the
investment game triadic experiment. I begin by discussing the implications of a model of
preferences over outcomes that can be conditional on the behavior of another. This model
provides clear testable hypotheses about trust and reciprocity. Subsequently, I discuss some
questions that have been raised about this approach.

<-----Page 7----->J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

267

5.1. Implications of a model of preferences over outcomes
Note that the definition of reciprocity in Section 2 incorporates a possible dependence
of preferences over outcomes upon the process that generated those outcomes and beliefs
about the behavior of others. Such dependence can provide an explanation of why rational
agents undertake actions involving trust and reciprocity. Thus, a first mover can rationally
undertake a trusting action if she believes that this choice may trigger a social norm in
the second mover that causes him not to defect. Alternatively, a first mover can rationally
undertake a trusting action if he believes that the second mover has altruistic or inequalityaverse unconditional other-regarding preferences. The experimental design for game triads
explained in Section 4 makes it possible to discriminate between the implications of
unconditional other-regarding preferences and trust or reciprocity.
I will use the following specific criteria for deciding whether a first mover’s behavior
is trusting. A first mover will be said to undertake an action in the investment game that
exhibits trust if the chosen action:
(i) gives a positive amount of the first mover’s money endowment to the second mover;
and
(ii) is risky for the first mover, in the sense that the amount of money that is sent is larger
than the amount that would maximize the first mover’s utility if none were to be
returned by the second mover.
Thus a trusting action requires a belief by the first mover that the second mover will not
defect and keep too much of the profit generated by the first mover’s decision to send a
positive amount. If a first mover has self-regarding preferences then the act of sending
any positive amount implies trust because such a first mover will lose utility if the second
mover does not return at least as much money as the first mover gave up. But a first mover
may have other-regarding preferences. Since, in the investment game any amount sent by
the first mover is tripled, a first mover with altruistic preferences might prefer to give
the second mover some money even if she knew that she would get nothing back. Thus
the mere act of sending a positive amount of money is not evidence of trusting behavior
unless it is known that first movers have self-regarding preferences. But the treatment
B dictator game, together with the treatment A investment game, permit one to identify
trusting actions, as follows.
Assume that each subject in every pair has preferences over her own and the paired
subject’s money payoffs that can be represented by a utility function. These preferences can
be other-regarding or self-regarding. If the preferences are self-regarding then the utility
function is a constant function of the other’s money payoff. If the preferences are otherregarding then they can be altruistic or inequality-averse. In treatment B, a first mover
chooses an amount to send from the set, S of integers weakly between 0 and 10. The
choice in treatment B, sb implies
u1 (10 − sb , 10 + 3sb )  u1 (10 − s, 10 + 3s),

for all s ∈ S.

(1)

Now assume that the amount of money that the first mover gives to the second mover in
treatment A, sa is larger than the amount given in treatment B. Then we can conclude

<-----Page 8----->268

J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

that the first mover has exhibited trust because the amount sent in treatment A is too large
to be fully explained by other-regarding preferences. Thus, if sa > sb then we know that
the first mover is exposed to risk from the possibility that the second mover will defect
and appropriate too much of the money transfer. Specifically, if the second mover were
to return nothing in the event that sa > sb , then statement (1) and strict quasi-concavity
of u1 imply that the first mover will have lower utility than he could have attained if he had
known that the second mover would return nothing:
u1 (10 − sa , 10 + 3sa ) < u1 (10 − sb , 10 + 3sb )

(2)

because sa ∈ S.
Next consider the question of identifying reciprocal behavior. The preferences over payoff (ordered) pairs can be conditioned on a social norm for reciprocity. For example, if the
first mover in the investment game sends the second mover some of her money, the second
mover may be motivated by a social norm for reciprocity to repay this generous action with
a generous response. Within the context of a model of preferences over material payoffs,
a social norm for reciprocity can be introduced with a state variable. Thus, the preferences
over payoffs can be conditional on a state variable for reciprocity. This is an appropriate
representation because, if there is reciprocal behavior, then individuals behave as if they
are more altruistic towards another person after that person has been kind, generous, or
trusting. The empirical question is whether or not second movers in the investment game
choose more generous actions, after the first mover has intentionally sent them money, than
they would in the absence of the first mover’s action but the presence of the same money
allocation.
When analyzing data from this experiment, I will use the following specific criteria
for deciding whether a subjects’ behavior is reciprocal. A second mover will be said to
undertake an action that exhibits positive reciprocity if the chosen action:
(i) returns to a generous first mover a positive amount of money; and
(ii) is costly to the second mover, in the sense that the amount returned is larger than the
amount that would maximize the second mover’s utility in the absence of the generous
action by the first mover.
A second mover with self-regarding preferences will not return any money to the first
mover. But a second mover with either altruistic or inequality-averse other-regarding
preferences may return money to the first mover who, after making a positive transfer
to the second mover, now has a lower money endowment than the second mover. Thus the
mere fact that the second mover returns money to the first mover is not evidence of positive
reciprocity. But the treatment C dictator game, together with the treatment A investment
game, permits one to identify reciprocal actions, as follows.
A “second mover” in treatment C is given an endowment that is inversely related to
the endowment of the paired subject. The endowments of a pair of subjects in treatment C
are determined by a (distinct) first mover’s decision in treatment A (but the subjects do
not know this). Thus, the endowments of a pair of treatment C subjects are given by
(10 − sa , 10 + 3sa ). In treatment C, a “second mover” chooses an amount to return from the

<-----Page 9----->J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

269

set, R(sa ) that contains the integers weakly between 0 and 3sa . The choice in treatment C,
rc implies
u2 (10 + 3sa − rc , 10 − sa + rc )
 u2 (10 + 3sa − r, 10 − sa + r),

for all r ∈ R(sa ).

(3)

Suppose that the second mover returns to the first mover in the investment game a positive
amount of money or, perhaps, even a larger amount than the first mover sent: ra  sa . This,
in itself, does not support a conclusion that the second mover was motivated by positive
reciprocity because the assumed choice could have been motivated by maximization of
unconditional altruistic or inequality-averse other-regarding preferences. However, if one
observes that ra > rc then he can conclude that the second mover was motivated by reciprocity because the amount of money returned is too large to be fully accounted for by
unconditional other-regarding preferences. This follows from noting that ra > rc , statement (3), and strict quasi-concavity of u2 imply
u2 (10 + 3sa − ra , 10 − sa + ra ) < u2 (10 + 3sa − rc , 10 − sa + rc )

(4)

because ra ∈ R(sa ).
It might, at first, seem inconsistent with utility maximization for a subject to return an
amount of money, ra that satisfies inequality (4). But a social norm for reciprocity can
change an agent’s preferences over material payoffs. Such a norm can be incorporated into
a theory of utility by introducing the possibility that an agent’s preferences over outcomes
can depend on the observed behavior of another. Specifically, with respect to reciprocity,
an agent’s preferences over his own and another person’s material payoffs can depend on
whether the other person intentionally helped him or intentionally hurt him or did neither.
Thus, let λa be a state variable that depends on the amount of money sent by the first mover
to the second mover in treatment A:
λa = f (sa ).

(5)

The utility to the second mover of the monetary payoffs in the investment game can be
conditional on the reciprocity state variable. Thus there need be no inconsistency between
inequality (4) and the norm-conditional-preference inequality,
u2λa (10 + 3sa − ra , 10 − sa + ra )
 u2λa (10 + 3sa − r, 10 − sa + r),

for all r ∈ R(sa ).

(6)

Furthermore, experiments on reciprocal behavior can be characterized as research on the
comparative properties of norm-unconditional (u2 ), and norm-conditional (u2λ2 ) utilitymaximizing behavior.
A complete model for interpreting data from the triadic investment game experiment is
presented in the appendix. Theoretical models that incorporate other-regarding preferences
over outcomes that can be conditional on the perceived intentions of others are reported in
Falk and Fischbacher (1999), Charness and Rabin (forthcoming), and Cox and Friedman
(2002).
In order to incorporate into game theory the possibility that agents can be motivated by
reciprocity, one needs to include the possibility that agents’ preferences over outcomes may

<-----Page 10----->270

J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

be conditional on the observed behavior of others. But if agents’ outcome preferences can
be conditional on observations of behavior, can they also be conditional on anticipations
of behavior?
5.2. What if outcome preferences can be conditional on anticipated behavior or are not a
characteristic of an agent?
It is conceivable that subjects’ outcome preferences could be conditional on anticipations of behavior of others, as illustrated by the following example constructed by a referee.
Suppose that the first mover in treatment B gives the paired subject $5, knowing that there
is no opportunity for the paired subject to return anything. Also suppose that the first mover
in treatment A gives the second mover $5, knowing that the second mover will have an opportunity to share the profit, from the tripling of amounts sent, by returning some money.
The zero return in treatment B is determined by the structure of the game. In contrast, if the
second mover in the investment game returns zero then the first mover may feel angry and
betrayed in addition to not realizing his intended distribution of payoffs. Anticipation of
this bad emotional outcome could cause a first mover in the investment game to send less
than in the dictator game. If subjects’ behavior were consistent with this example, then the
test for trusting behavior with data from the triadic design would be a conservative test because a first mover would require an even stronger belief that the second mover would not
defect in order to overcome the risks of both sub-optimal money payoffs and bad emotional
outcomes. As it turned out, the tests reported in Section 6 do reveal significant trusting behavior. Thus it would not be a problem if the tests were to be conservative, as implied by
the preceding example of anticipation-dependent utility of outcomes.
Another referee questioned the central assumption that underlies the triadic experimental design, which is the assumption that preferences are characteristics of agents. The argument was that, while the games in the three treatments may look similar using the author’s
theoretical framework, we do not know how subjects think about them. It was argued that
treatments A, B, and C may elicit different fairness norms, leading to the use of different
rules of thumb. The alternative approach advocated by the referee was to use data from
experiments with games like treatments A, B, and C to construct a portfolio of rules of
thumb that are shortcuts for making decisions in families of situations.
In the following section, I will analyze data from the three treatments using the theoretical framework developed in Section 5.1 and Appendix A. Authors of subsequent papers
may want to investigate whether preferences are characteristics of agents in fairness games.
6. Subjects’ behavior in the three games
The experiment sessions were conducted in the Economic Science Laboratory at the
University of Arizona in November 2000. Similar experiments comparing group and
individual behavior in the investment game were conducted in the spring of 1999 and
reported in Cox (2002).4 Subjects’ behavior in the investment game will first be discussed.

empirical support for the conclusion that the subjects’ behavior is characterized by trust
and/or reciprocity.
6.1. First- and second-mover decisions in the investment game
Figure 1 shows amounts sent and returned by subjects in treatment A, the investment
game. There are 32 pairs of subjects. The solid black bar for each numbered subject
pair shows the amount sent by the first mover, which will be multiplied by three by
the experimenter. The patterned bar for a subject pair shows the amount returned by the
second mover. There are six subject pairs, numbered 1–6, for which the first mover sent
zero and the second mover returned zero. The behavior of these six pairs is consistent
with the subgame perfect equilibrium of the traditional self-regarding preferences model,
whereas the behavior of the other 26 subject pairs is inconsistent with that equilibrium.
But the consistency of behavior of these six subject pairs must be related to the features of
the investment game, as it was implemented by Berg et al. (1995) and in the experiment
reported here. If a first mover sends zero then the second mover must return zero. Hence,
in this game, subject-pair consistency with the above subgame equilibrium prediction is
equivalent to consistency of data for only the first-mover. There are nine second movers
who received positive transfers but returned zero. The behavior of these nine second
movers is consistent with the self-regarding preferences model and it is not constrained
to be consistent by the structure of the game.
The first movers in the seven subject pairs numbered 11 to 17 sent exactly one-half of
their $10 endowments to the paired second mover. Two of the second movers who received
$15, from the $5 amounts sent, kept all of the money. Four of the second movers who were
sent $5 returned more than they were sent. And the remaining subject returned $3 to the
first mover who sent her or him $5.

Fig. 1.

<-----Page 12----->272

J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

The first movers in subject pairs 18 and 19 sent amounts greater than $5 and less than
$10. One of the paired second movers returned more than was sent and the other second
mover returned nothing.
The first movers in the 13 subject pairs numbered 20–32 sent all $10 of their
endowments. The paired second movers exhibited considerable variability in their
responses. One of these second movers returned exactly $10, thus keeping all of the profit
from the tripling of the amount sent. Four of the second movers returned nothing, thus
ending up with $40 and leaving their paired first movers with $0. At the opposite extreme
of the data, three of the second movers who received $30 transfers returned $20, thus
choosing to implement the equal-split fairness focal point payoffs of $20 for each member
of the subject pair. One of the other second movers who was sent $10 shared the profit
by returning $17. Three other second movers did not share the profit but returned positive
amounts of $1, $6, and $9.
As shown in Fig. 1, 26 out of 32 first movers sent positive amounts. Is this trusting
behavior? Comparison of behavior in treatments A and B will make it possible to answer
this question. Figure 1 also shows that 17 of the second movers returned positive amounts
and there appears to be an overall increasing relationship between amounts returned and
amounts sent. Is this reciprocal behavior? Comparison of behavior in treatments A and C
will make it possible to answer this question.
6.2. Identifying trust, reciprocity, and altruism
Figure 2 shows the numbers of first movers in treatments A and B that sent amounts
varying from $0 to $10. The patterned bars represent treatment A (investment game)
data and the solid black bars represent treatment B (trust-control dictator game) data.
The first thing to note in Fig. 2 is that 19 out of the 30 first movers in treatment B sent
positive amounts of money to the paired subjects. Thus, there is substantial evidence of

unconditional other-regarding preferences in these data: when the cost of each dollar sent
to the paired subject was only $0.33, 63% of the subjects behaved as altruists.
Figure 2 shows that six subjects sent $0 in treatment A whereas 11 subjects made this
choice in treatment B. At the other extreme, 13 subjects sent all $10 in treatment A whereas
four subjects made this decision in treatment B. This pronounced difference suggests that
the first movers’ behavior in treatment A partly resulted from trust. Another notable difference in Fig. 2 is at $5: seven first movers sent that amount in treatment A but only three did
so in treatment B. Finally, note that there is more variability of behavior in treatment B data,
with six subjects sending amounts of $1, $8, or $9 that are not observed in treatment A.
Is there statistically-significant support for the existence of trust in the data? The
second column of Table 1 reports that the mean amount sent by first movers was $5.97 in
treatment A and $3.63 in treatment B. The mean amount sent in treatment A is significantly
greater than that in treatment B by the one-tailed two-sample t-test (p = 0.010) reported in
the fourth column of Table 1. Hence the means test supports the conclusion that the subjects
exhibited trust in the investment game. As reported in Table 1, the one-tailed Mann–
Whitney test also detects that the treatment A amounts sent are significantly greater than
the treatment B amounts sent (p = 0.010). The Epps–Singleton test detects a significant
difference between the cumulative distributions of amounts sent in treatments A and B
(p = 0.010). Hence all of these tests support the conclusion that there is significant trusting
behavior in the investment game.

Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3, the patterned bars show the amounts returned in treatment A (the investment
game) and the solid black bars show the amounts returned in treatment C (the reciprocitycontrol dictator game). The first thing to note in Fig. 3 is that 13 out of the 32 “second
movers” in treatment C “returned” positive amounts of money to the paired subjects. Thus,
there is substantial evidence of unconditional other-regarding preferences in these data:
when the cost of each dollar sent to the paired subject was as high as $1, 41% of the subjects
behaved as though they had altruistic or inequality-averse other-regarding preferences.
The floor axis in Fig. 3 records the amounts sent by first movers. The floor axis is
labeled with number/letter combinations. The number is the amount sent and the letter
designates a first mover who sent that amount in treatment A. Some notable differences
between treatments A and C show up in Fig. 3. First consider the 13 observations for
which the amount sent was $10. For this category, five out of the 13 second movers in
treatment A returned amounts greater than or equal to $10. In contrast, only one out of
the 13 “second movers” in treatment C that were “sent” $10 returned an amount greater
than or equal to $10. Another notable difference appears with the nine observations for
which the amount sent varied from $5 to $7. For this category, five out of the nine second
movers in treatment A returned more than was sent. In contrast, only one out of the nine
“second movers” in treatment C that were “sent” amounts between $5 and $7 “returned” an
amount greater than or equal to the amount “sent.” There are three observations for which
the amounts “returned” in treatment C exceed the amounts returned in treatment A when
the amounts sent are low, varying from $0 to $4.

<-----Page 15----->J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

275

Is there statistically-significant support for the existence of reciprocity in the data? The
third column of Table 1 reports that the mean amount returned by second movers was $4.94
in treatment A and $2.06 in treatment C. The mean amount returned in treatment A is significantly greater than that in treatment C by the one-tailed two-sample t-test (p = 0.018)
reported in the fourth column of Table 1. The one-tailed Mann–Whitney test also detects that the treatment A amounts returned are significantly greater than the treatment B
amounts returned (p = 0.061). The Epps–Singleton test does not detect a significant difference between the cumulative distributions of amounts returned in treatments A and C
(p = 0.219).
The last row of Table 1 reports tobit estimates of the parameters of the following relation
between amounts sent, St and amounts returned, Rt in treatments A and C:
Rt = α + βDt St + γ St + εt ,
where

(7)



1 for treatment A data,
(8)
0 for treatment C data.
The bounds for the tobit estimation are the bounds imposed by the experimental design:
Dt =

Rt ∈ [0, 3St ].

(9)

One would expect that the cone created by these bounds might produce heteroskedastic
errors. In order to allow for the possibility of heteroskedastic errors, the tobit estimation
procedure incorporates estimation of the θ parameter in the following model of multiplicative heteroskedasticity:
σt = σ eθSt .

(10)

Note that β̂ is the estimate of the effect of reciprocity on amounts returned by second
movers. We observe that β̂ is positive and significantly greater than 0 (p = 0.034); hence
the tobit estimation supports the conclusion that the subjects exhibited positive reciprocity
in the investment game. As noted above, the means test and Mann–Whitney test support
the same conclusion.

7. Concluding remarks
This paper reports experiments with a triadic design that can identify trusting and
reciprocating behavior. Several researchers had previously reported the replicable result
that the majority of first movers send positive amounts and the majority of second movers
return positive amounts in investment game experiments. This pattern of results, and
results from many other fairness experiments, are inconsistent with the subgame perfect
equilibria of the special case of game theory in which players are assumed to have selfregarding preferences. This leaves the profession with the task of constructing a less
restrictive model that can maintain consistency with the empirical evidence. But this
task cannot be undertaken successfully unless we can discriminate among the observable
implications of alternative causes of the deviations from behavior predicted by the selfregarding preferences model. The game triad experiments reported here make it possible to

<-----Page 16----->276

J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

discriminate among the observable implications for subjects’ choices of trust, reciprocity,
and unconditional other-regarding preferences. This discrimination is possible because:
(i) treatments A and B jointly identify the trusting behavior that results from beliefs about
others; and
(ii) treatments A and C jointly identify the reciprocating behavior that results from
imputations of the intentions of others.
There are a few other studies that have used control treatments for intentions. Blount
(1995) compared second mover rejections in a standard ultimatum game with second
mover rejections in games in which the first move was selected randomly or by an outside party rather than by the subject that would receive the first mover’s monetary payoff.
She found lower rejection rates in the random treatment than in the standard ultimatum
game and lower or similar rejection rates in the third party and standard games, depending upon the choice of elicitation mode for subjects’ decisions. Charness (forthcoming)
used Blount’s control treatments in experiments with the gift exchange game. He found
somewhat higher average second mover contributions in the outside party and random
treatments than in the standard gift exchange game. The average figures reported by Charness reflect lower second mover contributions in the gift exchange game than in the control
treatments at low wage rates, a result that is consistent with negative reciprocity. Bolton
et al. (1998) experimented with an intentions-control treatment in the context of simple
dilemma games. In the control treatment, the row player “chooses” between two identical
rows of monetary payoffs. They found no significant differences between the column players’ responses in the control treatments and the positive and negative reciprocity treatments.
Our experiment provides evidence of altruistic other-regarding preferences, trust, and
reciprocity. These results have the following implications for constructing a model that
will be consistent with the observed behavior. First, utility should not be assumed to be a
constant function of others’ money payoffs, as in the self-regarding preferences model.
This is required in order to maintain consistency with the treatment B and C dictator
games in which the majority of subjects give money to the paired subjects knowing that
the paired subjects have no decision to make. Second, beliefs about others’ altruistic and
reciprocating behavior should be incorporated in the model. This is required in order to
maintain consistency with the trusting behavior that is jointly identified by the investment
game (treatment A) and the beliefs-control dictator game (treatment B). Third, the otherregarding preferences should be conditional on the perceived intentions behind others’
actions. This is required in order to maintain consistency with the reciprocating behavior
that is jointly identified by the investment game (treatment A) and the intentions-control
dictator game (treatment C).

Appendix A. Testable hypotheses derived from the triadic experimental design
I shall explain the structure of the three games and model the players’ (utility) payoffs
in a general way. Each player’s utility function will explicitly incorporate the monetary
income of the paired player. It is important to understand that I am not assuming that
the game players necessarily have other-regarding preferences; instead, I am allowing for
that possibility. The subjects’ behavior in the experiment with the three games informs
us as to whether they do or do not have other-regarding preferences. The second mover’s
utility function will explicitly incorporate a state variable that introduces the possibility
that a trusting action by the paired first mover could trigger an internalized social norm
that affects the second mover’s utility of the two players’ money payoffs from the game.
It is also important to understand that I am not assuming that the game players necessarily
are affected by social norms for reciprocity but am, rather, including that as a possibility.
Once again, it is the subjects’ behavior in the experiment that informs us on this question.
A.1. Treatment A
Treatment A is the investment game, which can be modeled as follows. The first mover
chooses sa ∈ S, where
S = {0, 1, 2, . . ., 10}.

(A.1)

The choice of sa by the first mover selects the Γ (sa ) subgame, in which the second mover
chooses ra ∈ R(sa ), where
R(sa ) = {0, 1, 2, . . ., 3sa }.

(A.2)

At the time the first mover makes her choice of sa , she may not know what choice
the second mover will subsequently make. Let the random variable r̃ with probability
distribution function Ω(r̃|sa ), defined on R(sa ), represent the first mover’s beliefs about
the amount of money that will be returned by the second mover in subgame Γ (sa ).
The first mover’s expected payoff from choosing sa in game A is


(A.3)
EPA1 = E u1 (10 − sa + r̃, 10 + 3sa − r̃) .
Ω(r̃|sa )

In the special case where the first mover has self-regarding preferences, u1 is a constant
function of the second mover’s income.
A.2. Treatment B
Treatment B is a dictator game with the same strategy set for the first mover as in the
investment game. Thus the first mover chooses sb ∈ S, where S is defined in statement
(A.1). The “second mover” does not have a decision to make. The (utility) payoff to the
first mover is
PB1 = u1 (10 − sb , 10 + 3sb ).

(A.4)

<-----Page 18----->278

J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

A.3. Treatment C
Treatment C involves a game C(n), that is selected by the choice made by a first mover
in treatment A. It is a dictator game with the same strategy set for the “second mover”
that a second mover has in treatment A. Thus the “second mover” chooses rc ∈ R(sa ). The
(utility) payoff to the “second mover” in game C(n) will not be dependent on the possible
operation of a social norm for reciprocity because the first mover has no decision to make
in this game.
A.4. Payoffs dependent on social norms
The utility to the second mover of the monetary payoffs from a game can be made
conditional on the possible operation of a social norm for reciprocity. Thus, the payoff to
the second mover from the choices of sa and ra in game A will be written as
PA2 = u2λa (10 + 3sa − ra , 10 − sa + ra )

(A.5)

because the second mover knows that the first mover has chosen the action sa and may feel
obliged to reciprocate. The notation u2λa permits the utility of monetary payoffs to vary
with a state variable λa that depends on the amount of money sent by the first mover to the
second mover in treatment A:
λa = f (sa ).

(A.6)

In contrast, in game C(n) the “second mover” knows that the “first mover” has no decision
to make. Since there is no opportunity for trusting actions by the “first mover” in game
C(n), there is no reason for a social norm for reciprocating to be triggered. Thus the payoff
to the “second mover” from the choice of rc in game C(n) will be written as
2
= u2 (10 + 3sa − rc , 10 − sa + rc ).
PC(n)

(A.7)

In the special case where a social norm for reciprocity does not affect utility of monetary
payoffs, u2λa is identical to u2 for all sa ∈ S.
A.5. Testing for the presence of trust
In order validly to conclude that a first mover has demonstrated trust, the researcher
must have knowledge that she has borne a risk of loss from her choice in game A. Thus it
must be known that there exists rz ∈ R(sa ) and sτ ∈ S such that
u1 (10 − sa + rz , 10 + 3sa − rz ) < u1 (10 − sτ , 10 + 3sτ ).

(A.8)

Assuming that u1 is strictly quasi-concave (and recalling that the variables are discrete),
the choices by the first mover allow the researcher to conclude that (A.8) is satisfied by
rz = 0 and sτ = sb if
sa > sb + 1.

(A.9)

This can be seen by noting that the choice by the first mover in game B and strict quasiconcavity of u1 imply
u1 (10 − sb , 10 + 3sb ) > u1 (10 − s, 10 + 3s),

∀s ∈ S, s > sb + 1.

(A.10)

<-----Page 19----->J.C. Cox / Games and Economic Behavior 46 (2004) 260–281

279

The null hypothesis is that the self-regarding preferences model makes empirically-correct
predictions. In the present context, this means that the first mover has not exhibited trust:
H0T : sa  sb + 1,

(A.11)

with alternative
HAT : sa > sb + 1.

(A.12)

It may seem unlikely that the first mover will be indifferent between sb and sb + 1;
hence the null hypothesis in statement (A.11) may seem to bias the tests against finding
that the data contain evidence of trust. Furthermore, across-subjects comparisons between
treatments involve means and other aggregations of data for which the $1 unit of
discreteness does not apply. Therefore, the tests reported are for the null hypothesis,
T
: sa  sb ,
H00

(A.13)

with alternative given by
T
HAA
: sa > sb .

(A.14)

T.
Of course, the hypotheses that are tested statistically will be stochastic versions of H00

A.6. Testing for the presence of reciprocity
In order validly to conclude that a second mover has demonstrated positive reciprocity,
the researcher must have knowledge that the second mover has incurred a cost to repay
a social debt to the first mover. This can be manifested by the second mover choosing to
return an amount of money in game A that is larger than the amount that would maximize
his utility in the absence of a social norm for reciprocating. Thus, the second mover has
exhibited positive reciprocity in game A if there exists ry ∈ R(sa ) such that
u2 (10 + 3sa − ry , 10 − sa + ry ) > u2 (10 + 3sa − ra , 10 − sa + ra ).

(A.15)

Assuming that u2 is strictly quasi-concave (and recalling that the variables are discrete),
the choices by the second mover allow the researcher to conclude that (A.15) is satisfied if
ra > rc + 1.

(A.16)

This can be seen by noting that the choice by the “second mover” in game C(n) and strict
quasi-concavity of u2 imply
u2 (10 + 3sa − rc , 10 − sa + rc ) > u2 (10 + 3sa − r, 10 − sa + r),
∀r ∈ R(sa ), r > rc + 1.

(A.17)

The null hypothesis is that the self-regarding preferences model makes empirically-correct
predictions. In the present context, this means that the second mover has not exhibited
reciprocity:
H0R : ra  rc + 1,

(A.18)

with alternative
HAR : ra > rc + 1.

(A.19)

<-----Page 20----->280

reciprocity are based on stochastic versions of
