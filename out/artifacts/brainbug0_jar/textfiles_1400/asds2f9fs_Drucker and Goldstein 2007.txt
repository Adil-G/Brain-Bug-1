Research universities in the United States have increasingly become involved in economic development since the mid-1980s. There has been a corresponding growth of interest in measuring the
impacts of higher education on regional economies. This article reviews the approaches used to
examine the influence of research universities on regional economic development outcomes.
Considerable attention is paid to the methodological advantages and shortcomings of four major
research designs evidenced in the literature: single-university impact studies, surveys, knowledge
production functions, and cross-sectional and quasiexperimental designs. University activities,
particularly knowledge-based activities such as teaching and basic research, have been found to
have substantial positive effects on a variety of measures of regional economic progress.
Keywords: economic impact; economic development; human capital; universities; research;

The past twenty years have seen a burgeoning interest in both the research and
policy communities in understanding and modeling the effects that institutions of
higher education have on regional and national economic conditions. Dramatic
changes in regional and international economic conditions, such as the globalization of commerce and the shift in developed economies from traditional manufacturing to knowledge-intensive production and services, have provided much of
the impetus for this attention. State and regional economic development agencies
in the United States as well as in other economically advanced nations are increasingly driven toward strategies designed to leverage the emerging knowledge-based
economy in their regions. Many of these strategies have focused on public
universities as the primary public producers of knowledge. Technology transfer

programs, university-industry partnerships, and educational curricula tailored to
match the skill demands of local knowledge-based industries provide just a few
examples of such economic development programs. These university activities,
along with others such as conducting basic research and serving as a regional
repository of expertise, heavily influence the abilities of regions to attract and
retain technology-intensive firms, to provide the regional labor force with modern knowledge skills, and to respond flexibly to uncertain and rapidly changing
economic circumstances.
In the United States, the passage of the Bayh-Dole Patent and Trademark
Amendments Act of 1980, followed by additional amendments in 1984, represents
part of a broad policy shift toward stronger intellectual property rights (Mowery and
Sampat 2004). The act permitted universities (along with other nonprofit organizations and small businesses) to hold the intellectual property rights to patentable
inventions arising from federally sponsored research (COGR 1999; Mowery et al.
1999). This change in federal research policy further bolstered direct university
engagement in entrepreneurial activities as well as collaborations with private
industry (Feller 1990; Jamison and Jansen 2000; Henderson, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg
1998).1 Long-term declines in state and local government finances have also added
to pressures to demonstrate positive economic returns from public investments in
tax-exempt educational institutions (Adams 2003; Arnone 2004). Encouraged thus
at the federal, state, and local levels, United States universities have generally
embraced the goal of economic development as a complement to their traditional
missions of education, research, and public service. The prospect of supplementary
earnings from patents, licensing, and industrial collaborations has acted as an additional lure in a period of tight public education budgets.
Public investments naturally generate questions concerning the magnitude and
distribution of their impacts as well as their effectiveness in achieving desired
objectives. For research universities, issues of knowledge production and dissemination are considered central to modeling and understanding the impacts on surrounding regional economies. In addition, the waxing popularity and applicability
of new growth theory and the new economic geography framework have focused
attention on the processes of knowledge creation and diffusion.
There have been numerous attempts made to assess the impacts of the activities undertaken by institutions of higher education. The approaches and methodologies have varied widely, and perhaps not too surprisingly, have yielded a wide
range of estimates regarding the impacts of universities on their regional
economies. This article reviews the existing body of literature surrounding the
question of whether and to what extent institutions of higher education influence
regional economic development outcomes. Although the focus is mainly on fouryear research universities in the United States, relevant work pertaining to
Canadian and European research universities and occasionally to other types of
knowledge-generating institutions is included as well.

INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW (Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007)

TOWARD A TYPOLOGY OF UNIVERSITY FUNCTIONS
There has been considerable effort devoted to understanding the contributions
of universities to the functioning of regional economies. One basic task is to distinguish the different ways in which universities and other institutions of higher
education potentially contribute to regional economic development. Modern universities embody a diverse set of missions and organizational goals that differentially impact their surrounding regions as well as the broader national and
international economic contexts, ranging from the traditional functions of teaching and public service to the more recent activities of licensing inventions and
engaging in collaborative research efforts with private-sector industries (Thanki
1999; Glasson 2003).
Synthesizing previous research, Goldstein, Maier, and Luger (1995) identify
eight different functions, or outputs, of modern research universities that may
potentially lead to economic development impacts:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.

Creation of knowledge.
Human-capital creation.
Transfer of existing know-how.
Technological innovation.
Capital investment.
Regional leadership.
Knowledge infrastructure production.
Influence on regional milieu.

Although each of the items in this list represents a distinct university output, they
are not mutually exclusive in terms of university activities—particular activities
may overlap among the identified functions. Each of the outputs, however, may
cause a distinct pattern of effects on the regional economy, ranging from the
direct and indirect effects of university spending to productivity gains in private
enterprises, from the creation of new firms to increases in regional creativity and
the capacity to sustain long-term development and growth.
Because some of the outputs identified by Goldstein, Maier, and Luger are less
well-defined and straightforward than others, it is worth specifying them in more
detail. The formulation and sharing of knowledge and wisdom has been the raison
d’etre of universities since their origins in Europe in the Middle Ages. Research universities have long recognized the creation of human capital as a second component
of their mission. The development of human capital is intrinsic in the process of
establishing new knowledge as faculty, students, and researchers develop their own
intellectual and technical skills and also occurs through activities such as distance
learning, industrial extension, and community education programs.
The transfer of technology and know-how is analogous to the creation of human
capital but focuses on applying existing knowledge to solve a specified problem,
typically improving a product or enhancing a process (Luger and Goldstein 1997).
In the United States, the function was initially associated with the extension

<-----Page 3----->Drucker, Goldstein / IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

23

programs of land-grant universities but has since spread to most other research universities. Recipients of technology-transfer activities tend to be businesses, civic or
nonprofit organizations, government agencies, or individual citizens rather than
university students or employees. Technology transfer is distinguished from technological innovation, which refers to the creation and commercialization of new
products or processes at the university itself and often leads to patenting or licensing the results of university-based researchers to commercial interests.
Regional leadership signifies the capacity of a university and its employees to
serve the region through direct participation on local committees and boards, the
provision of technical resources and support, and the exercise of moral authority,
and in some cases, political clout to help establish consensus and resolve conflicts. Universities are also important regional actors simply for their volume of
investment in physical capital: constructing and maintaining buildings, laboratories, research parks, and additional types of facilities along with associated transportation and other infrastructure.
The last two university outputs are decidedly less well-defined than the six
described above. The concept of knowledge infrastructure has become familiar
through the literature of economics via endogenous growth theory, as one component of a more extensive concept of regional agglomeration economies (Krugman
1991; Romer 1990). Knowledge infrastructure can be defined as the stock of
knowledge together with the institutional and organizational components that support its growth and application (Smith 1997). On the regional scale, knowledge
infrastructure extends beyond public and private knowledge-producing institutions
to the innovation and learning capacities of firms, workers, and institutions and the
network of connections among them. In quantitative studies, knowledge infrastructure is frequently generalized to agglomeration economies or proxied by agglomeration measures.
Finally, the notion of a university influence on regional milieu encompasses
the range of distinctive contributions that universities deliver to their surrounding
areas, be they intellectual, social, cultural, or recreational, by attracting a concentration of highly educated and creative professionals and establishing a particular locational dynamic (Luger and Goldstein 1997). These effects are usually
imparted unintentionally as a side product of university presence and activity,
with such externalities often valued highly by residents, businesses, and other
regional stakeholders. Negative externalities may also arise, such as labor-cost
increases that may accompany growth in university employment.
Some of these functions and impacts are more conducive to assessment than
others. Traditional approaches to assessing the impacts of universities have focused
largely on the impacts arising from direct spending and regional investment activities. Extensions of these spending-impact studies have branched into considering
the effects of human-capital creation and induced regional migration patterns. More
recent approaches have focused on the basic knowledge creation, knowledge-infrastructure provision, technological innovation, and technology-transfer activities of
universities. Little research has considered separately the impacts of regional

<-----Page 4----->24

INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW (Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007)

leadership or university influence on the regional milieu, largely because of the
methodological difficulty of distinguishing and measuring these influences.
There are four primary categories of methodological approaches to investigating
the impacts of universities on regional economic development that can be observed
in the literature, each presenting its own strengths and weaknesses. These categories
are single-university impact studies, surveys, knowledge-production functions, and
cross-sectional and quasiexperimental designs (Salter and Martin 2001).

IMPACT STUDIES OF INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES
Studies of the economic impact of individual universities or university systems
in the United States can be traced back in the literature at least to the early 1970s.
The methodology, particularly up to the early 1990s, was heavily influenced by a
report issued in 1971 by the American Council on Education that set forth and
advocated a standardized approach to impact estimation (Goldstein 1989;
Felsenstein 1996; Blackwell, Cobb, and Weinberg 2002). These studies focus on
estimating the direct and indirect impacts of university spending, investment, and
employment in a region. This is accomplished through the use of growth accounting, regional input-output modeling, estimation of Keynesian multipliers, or
occasionally, a broader regional economic forecasting model (Steinacker 2005;
Thanki 1999; Candell and Jaffe 1999).
For example, Glasson (2003), drawing on university employment and expenditure figures, calculates an output multiplier of 0.70 to 1.12 for Sunderland
University in Northeast England. Harris’ (1997) analysis of the University of
Portsmouth uses input-output information gleaned from extensive survey work
extending beyond the university to local businesses, augmented by estimations
based on national data. The study finds an employment multiplier between 1.55 and
1.79 and an output multiplier of 1.24 to 1.73. Felsenstein (1996) uses an econometric model based on regional input-output relationships to estimate that
Northwestern University contributed more than ten thousand jobs (an employment
multiplier of 1.55) and half a billion dollars in output (an output multiplier of 3.11)
to the Chicago metropolitan region in 1993. Felsenstein’s study goes further, simulating the adjustments in regional population and employment that would occur
over time in the counterfactual situation (i.e., removing the university from the
model), in an attempt to address the issue of whether alternative economic activities would arise as a substitute for the university. The simulation demonstrates only
a modest amount of alternative activity and employment compared with the much
larger magnitude of employment contraction occasioned by removing the university from the model. Steinacker (2005), proposing that impact analyses focused on
small (e.g., municipal) regions are appropriate for relatively small educational institutions, estimates a $10.5 million dollar impact in Claremont, California, from the
Claremont Graduate University in 2000. Candell and Jaffe (1999) adopt several
variants of input-output methodology to analyze the extent to which research institutions affect local industries in Massachusetts, concluding that the creation of

start-up firms is one of the most localized impacts of publicly funded research.
Felsenstein (1994) reviews a large number of earlier economic impact studies conducted in the United States.
Several reviewers of the body of university-impact-study literature have
argued that spending studies have not been well able to capture and quantify the
economic impacts of university activities. This is partly the result of methodological limitations and also partly because of the practice of considering too narrow a spectrum of university influences on regional economic development. For
instance, multiplier and input-output techniques are limited to assessing the backward linkages induced by the spending and regional investment activities of universities, and thus, fail to consider the special characteristics that distinguish
institutions of higher education from other economic organizations (Thanki
1999). Analyses of expenditure impacts consider static impacts arising from
existing relationships among organizations, whereas much of the impact of university activity may be caused by so-called dynamic impacts—the production of
knowledge or other outputs that alter interfirm relationships (Martin 1998). Beck
and Elliott (1995) note that there is no consensus across studies on how to define
the time frame of economic impacts, the appropriate geographical study area, or

<-----Page 7----->Drucker, Goldstein / IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

27

even the extent of the university (i.e., campuswide versus systemwide activities).
As with most other approaches, impact studies require explicit assumptions of the
counterfactual to be able to evaluate university impacts beyond what would have
occurred in the absence of the university; these vary widely across studies. In
addition, the outcome being measured is typically economic growth broadly
defined, omitting finer nuances associated with concepts of regional development, such as distributional effects (Thanki 1999).
More recent impact studies of institutions of higher education have begun to
use an eclectic set of data collection and analytical techniques to attempt to estimate a wider range of economic effects beyond spending and employment. Some
researchers have focused on quantifying outputs rather than attempting to translate them into economic variables. Examples include counting spin-off firms
(e.g., Smilor, Gibson, and Dietrich 1990; Brett, Gibson, and Smilor 1991; Ko
1993; Steffensen, Rogers, and Speakman 2000; Feller, Ailes, and Roessner 2002),
assessing the number and quality of university-industry linkages (e.g., Bitting
1994; Jones and Jenkins 1999; Jones-Evans et al. 1999; Rip 2002; Walshok et al.
2002), and measuring technology transfer outcomes such as patents and licensing
agreements and income (e.g., Clinch 1996; Randazzese 1996; Azzone and
Maccarrone 1997; Glasson 2003). Pressman et al. (1995) survey firms that had
been the recipients of Massachusetts Institute of Technology technology licenses
to calculate extended economic benefits in terms of total output. They estimate
that the 205 active license agreements held in 1995 induced industrial investments
of $980,000 per license-year. The methodology has been repeated for the
University of Pennsylvania, yielding the similar figure of $930,000 (Kramer et al.
1997). Rogers et al. (1999) count nineteen spin-off firms founded from University
of New Mexico research centers through 1996. Candell and Jaffe (1999) use
patent citations as a proxy for approximating the sectoral distribution of technology innovations arising from public research that encourage further private-sector spending on applied research and product development.
A number of researchers have investigated the human-capital impacts of a university on a region by examining student migration patterns. For instance, Goldstein
and Luger (1992) link historical student registration and alumni records to estimate
the percentage of graduates, by degree and discipline, that have remained employed
within the region over time. Similar analyses have been conducted by Blackwell,
Cobb, and Weinberg (2002), Huffman and Quigley (2002), and Glasson (2003).
Felsenstein (1995) uses Keynesian-type multipliers to estimate the amount of
university-induced migration, that is, migration over and above what would have
occurred in the absence of the university. Felsenstein (1996, 1999) calculates the
additional earnings that accrue to the region because of the retention of graduates and
their enhanced earning capabilities. These procedures are not without their criticisms: Thanki (1999) notes that Keynesian multipliers are often borrowed from other
research rather than case-specific; Blackwell, Cobb, and Weinberg (2002) suggest
that additional earnings estimates may be biased because of intrinsic ability differences; and Malecki (1997) argues that such studies necessarily underestimate the

<-----Page 8----->28

INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW (Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007)

total impact of human-capital generation by ignoring the induced effects of human
capital in attracting private-sector research and development and other technologybased production activities.
In large part, the impact-study framework is limited by information availability in providing quantitative estimates for the range of regional economic effects.
Otherwise promising quantitative frameworks such as benefit-cost analysis or
calculation of return on investment to public expenditures are often unworkable
in practice because of the lack of appropriate data or the impossibility of attributing impacts to particular universities or programs (Bessette 2003). As mentioned
above, one approach is to measure outputs of interest rather than ultimate economic outcomes. Some researchers have turned instead to the opposite end of the
methodological spectrum, focusing on qualitative or anecdotal information
(Feldman 1994; Candell and Jaffe 1999). For instance, Saxenian’s (1994) comparative case studies of Silicon Valley and Route 128 in Massachusetts use ethnographic techniques describing the extent and quality of interorganizational
linkages and collaborations to explain differences in economic performance
between the two regions. In a similar vein, Keane and Allison (1999) and Glasson
(2003) combine structured interviews with university administrative data to
assess university culture, the quality of university-industry linkages, and the
extent of university “embeddedness” within the region. Weiler (2000) describes
surveying local firms to determine the importance of feasibility studies conducted
by Colorado State University’s agricultural extension program in linking buyers
and suppliers and to categorize benefits accruing to private firms from such university-industry partnerships.
Since a major impetus for conducting impact studies of individual universities is to justify the expenditure of public funds, a substantial number of nonpeer-reviewed impact studies are commissioned by universities themselves.
These are either performed internally or more often are authored by specialized
consulting organizations (e.g., Philippidis 2005; Tripp Umbach & Associates
2003; Macaluso 2002; “UT-Arlington Economic Impact” 2003; “Study Measures
N. H. Colleges’ Economic Impact” 2003). There has been a surge in the number
of such studies conducted in early 2000 as an economic downturn and a subsequent wave of cuts in state educational budgets have prompted universities to
redouble their efforts to promote themselves as engines of economic growth
(Potter 2003). In general, these studies focus on the spending and investment
impacts of universities, but some have begun to address a wider range of university impacts, such as the retention of graduated students in the area, continuingeducation programs for the wider community, community leadership, influences
on local housing markets and urban regeneration, the creation of international
links via overseas students, and even local reductions in crime and substance
abuse (e.g., Shepherd 2002; MacIntyre 2003; Potter 2003).
As evidenced by the examples presented above, the principal advantage of the
single-university study consists of being able to collect primary data on a variety
of subjects (including some not amenable to quantification) such as patenting and

<-----Page 9----->Drucker, Goldstein / IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

29

licensing activity, spin-off companies, student graduation and migration patterns,
student and staff expenditures, internal university organization and culture, and
regional leadership. Single-case studies generally provide the most complete picture of the activities of a particular university. In addition, input-output, growth
accounting, multiplier, and regional economic model techniques require intensive
data-gathering efforts, and thus, are almost always conducted as part of a singlecase approach.
There are two major drawbacks to the approach of studying individual universities. The first is the attribution problem: determining the causal link between university activities and regional outcomes of interest. This difficulty is most evident
in assessing indirect impacts, such as regional productivity gains or increases in
regional innovative activity, that depend on a host of other external conditions or
intervening factors aside from those pertaining to institutions of higher education.
Some interviewers have asked respondents to judge the importance of the university in generating the particular outcome in question; such responses, however, are
of untestable quality and are subject to numerous obvious biases. The second shortcoming is that studies of individual universities lack generalizability to other universities, other regions, or even different economic situations. In theory, multiple
single-case studies using standard data and techniques could be joined to yield conclusions that present a greater degree of external validity, but the relatively high cost
of primary data collection makes this largely infeasible in practice.2

SURVEYS USED AS AN ECONOMIC-IMPACT ASSESSMENT TOOL
The second approach evident in the literature is based on surveys. Although
impact studies of individual universities or university systems often incorporate
information gathered via surveys and questionnaires, the survey approach to evaluating economic impacts is distinguished from the single-case study by its simultaneous application to a range of regions and institutions of higher education.
Thus, the survey methodology aims to overcome one of the weaknesses of the
single-case approach by producing results that are generalizable beyond particular institutions or regions.
Survey research is far less common in the university impact literature than are
single-case studies. One use has been to approach the attribution problem by posing questions that seek to elucidate the role of educational institutions vis-à-vis
other factors in bringing about regional economic development outcomes. For
instance, firms may be asked to rate the importance of regional universities to
their location decisions, research efforts, or overall productivity (Malecki and
Bradbury 1992; Luger and Goldstein 1997; Varga 1997; Beise and Stahl 1999).
Surveys have also been used to examine a variety of university impacts, including the ways in which different industries use public research, the impact of
regional scientific and human capital in industrial innovation, job formation
resulting from university-created technologies, and the importance of universityindustry collaborations to individual firms (Varga 1997; Bozeman 2000; Salter

<-----Page 10----->30

INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW (Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007)

and Martin 2001; National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant
Colleges 2001). For example, by examining a survey of research and development laboratories in the United States, Adams (2002) finds that knowledge
spillovers originating from universities are more geographically localized than
those from industrial research efforts, a result seconded by Beugelsdijk and
Cornet (2002) for the Dutch context. Surveys conducted of German and Spanish
firms, however, show the frequency of university-industry collaborations and
industrial innovations to be more closely aligned with the intensity of research
and development within firms than with proximity to research institutions (Beise
and Stahl 1999; Sáez, Marco, and Arribas 2002).
Perhaps the most prominent use of the survey approach in the United States and
Canada is the annual collection of quantitative and qualitative data concerning technology transfer by the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM).
Numerous studies have used the AUTM data set to analyze the operations or effectiveness of technology transfer offices across universities or over time (Bozeman
2000). Jamison and Jansen (2000) demonstrate the impact of the Bayh-Dole Act in
stimulating technology transfer activities at United States universities. Blumenstyk
(2002) and Carlsson and Fridh (2002) use AUTM data to examine the characteristics of universities that have been successful in technology transfer. Rogers et al.
(2000) link the effectiveness of university technology transfer offices with faculty
salaries, donations, and the capture of federal and industrial research funding.
Overall, the survey approach has only modestly extended the results achieved
through impact studies of individual universities. As noted earlier, survey questions
aimed at the attribution problem suffer from obvious validity threats such as respondent ignorance or bias. Presumably, respondents know more about their own firm
than they do about a particular technology or the industry in general (Salter and
Martin 2001). Attempts to generalize the impacts of universities on firm location
decisions have been ambiguous in that the effects seem to depend on various
regional, industry, and university characteristics (Varga 1997; Adams 2002). Two
approaches that have been somewhat more successful in addressing the problems of
attribution and generalization are production function and cross-sectional analyses.

THE MICROECONOMICS APPROACH: PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS
Economists in particular have taken a different approach to the assessment of
economic impacts by making use of knowledge-production functions. Starting
with the work of Solow (1957) that demonstrates empirically the existence of a
latent variable other than capital, labor, and land in aggregate production functions and encouraged by Arrow’s (1962) formulation of the impact of learning
(gains in knowledge) on production functions, economists began to realize the
importance of the role played by innovation in production. Abstracting from universities and the other knowledge producers, early knowledge-production models
focused on specifying functions to describe the production of information.
Griliches (1979) proposes including a specific measure of knowledge creation,

<-----Page 11----->Drucker, Goldstein / IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

31

namely expenditures on research and development, as an input to the production
of knowledge at either the firm or industry-sector level of analysis.
Jaffe (1989) modifies the Griliches knowledge-production function to the configuration that forms the basis for most current econometric research in the area
of knowledge and information creation. The general Griliches-Jaffe model uses a
measure of innovation, such as patents or new product introductions, as the
dependent variable, with industry and university research and development
expenditures as two independent variables in a production-function equation:
ln(P) = α0 + αI ln(RDI) + αU ln(RDU) + ε,

(1)

where P is the measure of innovation, RDI is industrial research and development,
and RDU is university research and development. In knowledge-production
research, the production function itself is typically specified in standard CobbDouglas form, though alternative specifications are sprinkled throughout the literature. Jaffe (1989) finds significant effects of university research on corporate
patents, particularly in certain technologically reliant fields such as pharmaceuticals, optics, electronics, and nuclear engineering. These effects are mediated by
spatial location—proximity to university research matters to corporate patents.
Many researchers subsequently have modified and extended the Griliches-Jaffe
model, and in so doing, have obtained a wide variety of results. Jaffe, Trajtenberg,
and Henderson (1993) and Jaffe and Trajtenberg (1996) examine the geographical
location of patent citations, finding substantial localization: other factors’ being
equal, patent citations are more likely to come from the same nation, state, and
region as the cited patents. Acs, Audretsch, and Feldman (1994) use a one-time
cross-sectional data set of 1,982 new product introductions constructed by the
United States Small Business Administration to determine that university research
and development has greater impacts for small firms than for large firms. There are
also significant differences across industrial sectors in the way that industries are
able to take advantage of proximate university activity and expertise. At the state
level, Riddel and Schwer (2003) find that industry research and university degrees
but not university research serve to stimulate patents in technology-based fields.
Start-up firms tend to be more geographically localized than other outcomes of university knowledge production (Candell and Jaffe 1999).
Additional research focuses more closely on the question of the importance of
spatial proximity in facilitating the economic impacts of university knowledge
production. Patent citation patterns suggest that knowledge diffusion may be geographically localized in Europe as well as the United States (Fischer and Varga
2003). Varga (1998, 2000) demonstrates the importance of agglomeration effects
in allowing firms in technology-intensive industries to take advantage of university research. Essentially, firms located in regions that are large in terms of population or employment, have a substantial concentration of own-industry and
other technology industry employment, and contain large volumes of business
and specialized services are more able to use knowledge generated by regional
universities to their production advantage. The magnitude of agglomeration

Spatial proximity is generally found to be more important to knowledge spillovers
in studies proxying knowledge production by research expenditures than by patents
(Varga 1997). In other words, studies that adopt patents as their sole measure of
knowledge production produce results regarding the geographic localization of
knowledge spillovers that do not match the results of research that instead uses
research expenditures. This prompts the question of the validity of patents as a sufficient measure of innovation and knowledge creation. Patents are used quite commonly to measure knowledge creation because they present a rare opportunity for
quantifying an innovation outcome. Researchers acknowledge a number of faults
with using patents as an indicator of knowledge generation (Jaffe 1989; Jaffe,
Trajtenberg, and Henderson 1993; Varga 1997; Henderson, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg
1998; Sampat, Mowery, and Ziedonis 2003). Certainly, not all knowledge is
patentable. For instance, codified knowledge is embodied in copyrights, trade
secrets, and scientific papers as well as patents, whereas tacit knowledge and shared
expertise may be as important to localized spillover effects as codified knowledge
but are largely unmeasurable. There is also no assurance that patent counts correspond to the quality or import of knowledge created. Henderson, Jaffe, and
Trajtenberg (1998) argue that the fact that United States university patents have
received fewer citations on average since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act suggests
that the entrepreneurial incentives established through that and subsequent legislation may be pushing universities to patent more innovations of lesser quality.
Similarly, Thursby and Thursby (2000) support the analogous contention that
licenses granted by research universities are of lowering quality over time. More
recent analyses, however, suggest that it is the time distribution of university patent
citations that is changing rather than the total citation impact over time (Mowery
and Ziedonis 2000; Mowery, Sampat, and Ziedonis 2002; Sampat, Mowery, and
Ziedonis 2003). Moreover, Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2000) strongly suggest that
patent citations are well correlated with market value of knowledge and thus are a
valid indicator of innovation and knowledge spillovers. Because of their ready data
availability, patents will likely continue to be used as a measure of knowledge creation in spite of unresolved validity issues.
Although econometric research may make use of functions describing the production of outputs other than knowledge in assessing university effects, little
empirical research has adopted this strategy. One isolated example is Martin’s
(1998) decomposition of total factor productivity growth in Canada to estimate
the contribution of domestic universities at the macroeconomic level.
In addition, numerous researchers have created dynamic regional models to
explore the implications of assumptions regarding innovation and knowledge
spillovers under simplified conditions (examples include Englmann and Walz
1995; Jones 1995; Kubo 1995; Young 1998; Black and Henderson 1999; Howitt
1999; Kielbach 2000; Karlsson and Zhang 2001; and Riddel and Schwer 2003).
These models generally fall within the family of endogenous growth models originated by Romer (1986, 1990) and adapted (e.g., by Fujita, Krugman, and
Venables 1999) to the regional context. Because these studies aim for theoretical

<-----Page 14----->34

INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW (Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007)

insights based on investigation of the interactions or dynamics of a system of
equations modeling a reduced set of economic and environmental conditions,
however, they do not hold direct implications for the empirical questions regarding knowledge production and diffusion.
Overall, analyses of knowledge production have demonstrated that knowledge,
as an output, has qualities that make it unique. As such, knowledge-producing
organizations must be considered differently than other large organizations with
substantial output and employment. External benefits of knowledge production in
the form of spatial spillovers lead to increased innovation among other regional
firms, though the body of research demonstrates considerable variety in the measured magnitude and significance of this effect. The range of approaches taken in
attempting to quantify and characterize innovative activity is indicative of the
methodological difficulties involved in using a model incorporating theoretically
specified relationships to study the impacts of universities. Restrictive assumptions as to the functional form and the particular components of the knowledgeproduction function provide structure and enhance statistical power but may be
difficult to justify empirically. Measurement and data-availability issues severely
limit the ability of production-function studies to separate the impacts of different university activities. Although the results of knowledge-production studies are
more easily generalizable than single-university studies, most of the research
described in this section concentrates on the technological innovation outputs of
research universities, neglecting the other ways in which universities contribute
to regional economic development.

CROSS-SECTIONAL AND QUASIEXPERIMENTAL
RESEARCH DESIGNS
Cross-sectional analyses are less restrictive than analyses that rely on strong
theory to specify a functional form.3 Essentially, cross-sectional analyses involve
selecting a sample from the full population or sampling frame and analyzing the
empirical relationships between the variables, most often using regression-based
statistical approaches. The appropriate dependent variables and measures of independent variables and control variables are suggested by the literature, the available
data, and the study context. The primary advantage of the cross-sectional approach
is flexibility; its disadvantages include susceptibility to sampling issues and omitted variable bias. Cross-sectional analyses impose relatively few modeling assumptions. On the other hand, to the extent that a particular production function does
accurately represent reality, the cross-sectional approach is less efficient in that it
ignores the information contained in a well-defined relational structure.
In the context of the regional economic development impacts of higher education
institutions, cross-sectional designs are commonly used in the absence of established
economic or other theory to guide the selection of an explicit functional form.
For instance, several studies consider the locations of technology-intensive firms
with regard to regional university presence, providing ambiguous results as to their

<-----Page 15----->Drucker, Goldstein / IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

35

colocation tendencies (Varga [1997] discusses Markusen, Hall, and Glasmeier 1986;
Glasmeier 1991; Bania, Eberts, and Fogarty 1993; and Audretsch and Stephan
1996). This ambiguity may be caused by the conflation of routine production tasks
with other industry activities such as research and development that depend more on
knowledge inputs. University and industry patents do tend to be colocated within
regions, at least within the specific fields of medical imaging, neural networks, and
signal processing (Agrawal and Cockburn 2003). Regression-based analyses of citation patterns suggest the importance of proximity in supporting university-industry
joint research efforts and other collaborations, though the effects are relatively weak
and vary across industries and nations (e.g., Tornquist and Hoenack 1996; Spencer
2001). Baryla and Dotterweich (2001) find, not very surprisingly, that institutional
quality, as proxied by nonresident tuition and selectivity statistics, encourages inmigration of nonresident students to the region, after controlling for regional characteristics such as urbanization and economic environment.
Studies of the formation of new firms have used cross-sectional methods, leading to divergent results across different national spatial contexts (Varga 1997).
Florax (1992) and Florax and Folmer (1992) use investments in manufacturing
equipment and buildings as proxies of firm presence, finding no relationship to
university proximity in forty regions within the Netherlands. Bania, Eberts, and
Fogarty (1993), examining twenty-five metropolitan areas in the United States,
find significant effects of university research on new-firm births for the electrical
and electronic equipment but not the instruments industry. By examining newfirm births using the United States Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Establishment
and Enterprise Microdata (LEEM) data set, Kirchhoff et al. (2002) demonstrate
that university research does spur the creation of new firms. In fact, since this link
accounts for all of the observed relationship between research and employment
growth, the study suggests that the firm-birth process is the primary mechanism
by which university research affects regional employment.4 Studies of firms in
Germany and the United States have demonstrated that the dependence of firm
births on university activity varies by industry sector and field (e.g., Swann and
Prevezer 1996; Zucker, Darby, and Brewer 1998; Harhoff 1999).
As with the single-case approach, there are cross-sectional econometric studies that examine eclectic relationships or data sets. Applying spatial econometric
methodologies to investigate the distribution of technology-intensive researchlaboratory employment across 125 United States metropolitan areas, Anselin,
Varga, and Acs (1997) find that universities have a large attractor effect on
research-laboratory location. Sivitanidou and Sivitanides (1995) reach a similar
result for private research laboratories at the intraregional scale within the greater
Los Angeles metropolitan area.
In contrast to cross-sectional analyses, quasiexperimental designs attempt to
mimic the conditions for true experiments as closely as possible in field settings
(Cook and Campbell 1979; Shadish, Cook, and Campbell 2002). Before introducing statistical controls for possibly intervening factors, researchers attempt to control their influence by strategically manipulating the study population, time period,
and sampling so as to either maximize or eliminate variation in rival factors, thus

reducing the probability of omitted variable biases. In studying the economic
impacts of institutions of higher education, the regional distribution of universities
by size and type would represent the treatment variable. A control group might consist of a set of regions lacking significant knowledge-producing organizations or a
different set of regions possessing types of knowledge organizations other than
research universities. Additional divisions among groups might be defined on the
basis of regional size (proxying agglomeration effects) or other relevant regional
characteristics. Although control-group cases cannot be assumed, as with true
experiments, to be equivalent to the treatment cases in all respects except for the
treatment itself, comparing gain scores—differences in the outcome variables over
time, that is, between a pretest and posttest—takes the different starting positions
into account.
Quasiexperimental designs have appeared occasionally in regional research
(e.g., Isserman 1987; Isserman and Merrifield 1987; Holmes 1998; Rogers and
Tao 2004), but to the authors’ knowledge, only one study has explicitly and exclusively used a quasiexperimental design to estimate the contributions of knowledgeproducing organizations to regional economic development outcomes. Goldstein and
Renault (2004) contrast the growth rates of average wages between the 1969–1986
and 1986–1998 periods across United States regions, using 1986 as a break point to
correspond roughly with the widespread introduction of entrepreneurial activities into
the operational repertoires of American research universities. They find that universities have a significant influence on regional economic development only in the
1986–1998 period and reach the general conclusion that the entrepreneurial activities
of universities are more important for economic development than the traditional

<-----Page 18----->38

INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW (Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007)

functions such as human-capital creation and regional leadership that were present in
both time periods.
In addition, by separating regions by total employment size, Goldstein and
Renault produce mixed evidence of the relationship between agglomeration
economies and university influence. Interactions between employment size and
university research are not significant in either time period, whereas regional size
has a positive effect, supporting the contention that agglomeration economies are
more important than universities in stimulating economic development. Only in
the smaller regions, however, is there a significant difference in the period from
1986 to 1998 between areas with and without a major research university, suggesting that universities may sometimes substitute for agglomeration.
It is also possible to combine some of the characteristics of cross-sectional and
quasiexperimental research designs. Goldstein and Drucker (2006) consider the
change in regional average wages in United States metropolitan statistical areas
(MSAs) for nonfarm jobs during the 1986 to 2001 period. The changes in wages are
adjusted for regional cost-of-living differences using regional consumer price
indices and are also normed to the United States to create a unitless variable. This
particular construction of the dependent variable as the change in an indexed value
during the study period is an element common to quasiexperimental designs that
helps to control for factors endemic to particular regions that account for the nonequivalence of the study areas. Nevertheless, because of the geographic dispersion
of university activities, particularly teaching, it is not possible to use regions that
lack university influences as control groups. Goldstein and Drucker divide the study
population of metropolitan regions into three groups according to base employment
level, fitting three regression equations separately. In addition, they adopt the crosssectional approach of including a variety of measures of university functions as the
key treatment variables in a multivariate regression context. These measures make
it possible to separate the impacts of technology development from the impacts of
the more traditional university functions of basic research and human-capital creation and to assess the interactions between agglomeration economies (of size) and
university activities. Indicators of spatial spillovers across regions are also included,
as are corrections for spatial dependence in the data.
The empirical results demonstrate that university research, teaching, and technology development do help to raise regional average earnings, with spillovers of knowledge and other benefits across regional boundaries influential as well. The effects of
universities within the region are found to be particularly important in relatively small
MSAs, those containing fewer than 200,000 nonfarm jobs, suggesting that universities may serve as a substitute for sheer size in regional development. In fact, universities may be less crucial as an ingredient for regional economic advancement in
larger MSAs since there they constitute a much smaller proportion of total innovative
activity. Despite the importance of university influences, factors external to universities, including the stock of business services and the educational attainment level, are
the most influential determinants of regional economic progress over all size regions.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
There are several interesting and important questions or approaches that form
promising areas for further research. First, there is the need for the identification or
development of high-quality measures and proxies of university activity to support
empirical analyses of the eight research university functions identified by Goldstein,
Maier, and Luger (1995) at the regional or local scale.5 Most of the knowledgeproduction function and cross-sectional analyses conducted to date use just a few
limited indicators of university activity: research funding or expenditures, degrees
awarded, publications and citations, numbers of scientists and engineers, and
simple or distance-weighted counts of institutions. Two university functions—the
influence of universities on the regional milieu and the effects of university
leadership—have received nothing beyond anecdotal attention in the literature. This
omission is almost certainly because of measurement difficulties, coupled with the
thorny puzzle of how to isolate the regional effects of these activities from each
other and from those of other university activities such as teaching, research, and
the creation of technological knowledge. Yet, an independent assessment of the
importance of these university effects is essential to fully informing the policy
debate concerning the funding and administration of public universities.
Second, there is further work to be done to understand and be able to predict
or model universities’ influences on regional migration. The inflow of students,
faculty, researchers, administrators, and others drawn or repelled by universities,
along with the subsequent retention or outflow of these migrants, is a crucial
determinant of the impacts of higher education institutions on their surrounding
regions. The importance of human-capital creation and attraction for local economic development depends on the trained and highly capable individuals’
remaining within or active in the region. As mentioned earlier, there have been a
number of investigations of student migration patterns, but these have been limited to studies of individual institutions, and because of the lack of applicable
data, they have also largely been constrained to students enrolled in degreeoriented programs. Student inflows are more easily measured than outflows since
university registration records provide a ready source of information on matriculants but not graduates. Information about nonstudent migrants is more elusive
and has so far been collected only through expensive (and far from exhaustive)
surveys. Understanding the migration effects of universities would again benefit
policy efforts to tailor public university activities to best serve their multiple missions of education, research, and economic development.
A related area of research consists of examining the spatial extent of the
economic development impacts of institutions of higher education. The importance of spatial proximity to university research has been demonstrated in econometric estimations of the production of patents, product innovations, start-up
firms, and research laboratory locations, with a mix of results in terms of the pattern of attenuation of influence with distance. This reduction in impact with distance, also known as the spatial gradient of influence, is relevant to the wider

<-----Page 20----->40

INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW (Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007)

range of university activities, such as regional leadership and the geographic distribution of retention of in-migrants. Once again, there are direct implications for
higher education policy. For instance, a relatively flat spatial gradient, indicating
that the positive influences of universities extend to larger distances than previously has been thought, would suggest less need for smaller branch campuses and
would instead support policies to concentrate resources (and take advantage of
economies of scale) in the large flagship institutions.
Finally, it would be useful to engage in cross-national comparisons of the effects
of universities. As is common to other areas of research, the differing histories,
roles, and structures of higher education systems across different nations have
largely been viewed as impediments to comparative research. This diversity may
also be perceived, however, as the basis for research investigating how diverse
country-specific economic, social, and institutional conditions mitigate or extend
the economic-development impacts of universities. There is a definite need for
research that carefully examines the effects of variations in higher education policy
on university-induced outcomes. Indeed, recent changes in governance and incentive structures that have brought some of the European Union nations closer to the
United States in terms of their systems of higher education might provide for an
interesting quasiexperimental study design. This focus may also interact with
another important and widely studied subject in regional research—the investigation of regional and national convergence. Do national systems of higher education
play a role in either helping or hindering lagging regions to close the gap with leading regions in terms of wealth or other measures of economic development, or are
their contributions “swamped” by other factors? If university effects indeed are significant, might it be possible to discern which attributes of national systems are
most important in explaining variations in the degree to which university activities
influence the process of convergence or divergence?

CONCLUSION
This article has reviewed the four major approaches taken in the literature to
examining and assessing the impacts of universities on regional economic development: impact studies of individual universities, surveys, production-function
estimations, and cross-sectional or quasiexperimental designs. Each of these
methods presents its own unique advantages and drawbacks, and each, with the
possible exception of survey methods, continues to be put to use commonly to
investigate the impacts of universities and other knowledge-producing entities.
Although there is considerable variety in the magnitude and confidence of the
results obtained, and often, nonuniversity regional factors are more influential than
university factors, the majority of empirical analyses do demonstrate that the
impacts of university activities on regional economic development are considerable.
This serves, to some extent, to validate state and local policies that are designed to
boost the new university economic development functions as well as those that support the more traditional research and human-capital creation activities of regional

<-----Page 21----->Drucker, Goldstein / IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES

41

universities. Certainly, there is more than enough evidence in the body of work to
date to merit a sustained policy focus on university activities as well as continued
research attention on the regional economic impacts of research universities and
other institutions of higher education.

NOTES
1. See Mowery and Sampat (2004) for a dissenting view.
2. The exception may be non-peer-reviewed reports commissioned by national associations representing the institutions themselves (e.g., Tripp Umbach Healthcare Consulting 2004).
3. The term cross-sectional is used here to denote the use of a cross-sectional design engaged
without reference to a particular causal structure based on a theory of production. Although timeseries and panel designs might be used similarly, they have not typically been applied to studies of the
economic development impacts of universities, other than in single-case studies, because of the lack
of suitable data.
4. The relationship between university research and employment growth becomes insignificant in
all models tested by Kirchhoff et al. (2002) that include firm-birth rates as an independent variable.
5. See Goldstein and Drucker (2006) for a more detailed discussion of the indicators of university
activity available at the regional scale for the United States.
