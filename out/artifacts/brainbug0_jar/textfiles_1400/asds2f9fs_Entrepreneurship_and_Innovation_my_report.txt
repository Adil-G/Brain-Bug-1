<-----Page 1----->ABSTRACT
This report is separated in two parts.
The first is dedicated to a book review, namely “The Strategy Paradox: why committing
to success leads to failure” by Mr. Michael Raynor, which is a radical approach on how a
company can embrace uncertainty. Its reading gave us the stimulus to recall a number of
principles and techniques used in the modern management. We compare and learn from a
given number of cases, which had a common parameter: the strategic planning, its
orientation and finally the introduction of a number of tools, which entrepreneurs can use
in order to be prepared for the future.
The second part is a case analysis that refers to entrepreneurship. We analyse the case
study of Hotmail trying to understand and utilize a number of findings that are closely
related to the principles of innovation within entrepreneurship.

Both findings were impressive and useful for further reference.

<-----Page 2----->SUMMARY
Purpose – In the first part of the report (book review), we are trying to clearly understand
and extract all useful meanings that author (Mr. Michael Raynor) includes in his book
(main idea, purpose, strengths & weaknesses). In continuous, through comparisons,
evaluation and critical thinking, we pursue to incorporate these ideas, the tools and the
philosophy illustrated, as our findings for future implementation. In the second part,
through a case analysis we develop a number of issues related to entrepreneurship. We
review
Design/Methodology/Approach – The report is consisted of two parts. Both parts are
based on a query-approach analysis. Thus, their development is articulated around a
number of issues related to the nature of the given questions. In order to accomplish the
requested research a number of academic resources were used such as technical reports,
journals and books.
Findings – Uncertainty is not our enemy but a strategic component of the global
environment. Instead of trying to predict and fight it, it is better to embrace and understand
it. There are principles and tools that can help us to achieve this. We are living in an
inescapable world of trade-offs so as a result it is a necessity to think differently. We must
learn to face the unexpected future because future favors the prepared minds.
Entrepreneurship is the ability to transform an invention to a viable business. This
transformation needs continuous effort and real knowledge for the firm, to create growth
and maintain its sustainability. Recognizing opportunities, selecting business models,
preparing business plans, collaborating and finally getting funds are some of the crucial
stages that take part in this transformation. Innovation is present everywhere and it is
necessary to be combined with the entrepreneurial spirit.
Research limitations/implications – All material processed are derivatives and
conclusions of research made by various groups of authors/scientists on this issue. We
have tried to include material that has approached the issue in different ways in order to
cover the subject in a broaden manner.
Practical Implications – This report is aim to help, on the one side, the researchers to find
some structured and compressed knowledge on the abovementioned issues, whiles on the
other side, the entrepreneurs to incorporate a different approach in uncertainty and the
meaning of launching a new venture.
Originality/Value – This report was prepared as the second paper to submit for the MSc in
Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship course (University of Sheffield – CITY
Liberal Studies). The relevant module for which is submitted is the “Entrepreneurship &
Innovation”, with module director Dr. Panayiotis Ketikidis.
Keywords – Strategic planning, forecasting, strategic uncertainty, strategic flexibility,
commitment, adaptability, forecasting, entrepreneurship, passion, commitment strategic
partnerships, venture capital, financing.
Paper type – Typewritten report

<-----Page 5----->INTRODUCTION
The first part of this report is dedicated to a book review. The “Strategy Paradox” of Mr
Michael Raynor, is an important book, worth to read, which introduces an innovative
approach regarding strategic planning. The author in his book points out that “strategies
with the greatest possibility of success also have the greatest possibility of failure”. [1]
This is what he calls “the strategy paradox”.
Companies, which are pursuing high returns, undertake in consequence a high risk, which
implies high exposure in the area of uncertainty. Most companies rather prefer to stay in
the middle (mediocre) trying to avoid this exposure. In fact, they prefer to gain less for
nothing.
Therefore, companies that avoid strategic risk may survive, but do not prosper.
In the second part, we are reviewing the case of Hotmail. Trying to answer in a number of
queries, relevant to its launch, financing and the incorporation in a partnership network, we
have made a research in a number of resources to investigate a series of issues. These are,
the nature of business partnerships, the launching of a start-up firm – ideas and
opportunities – the entrepreneurial spirit, funding issues, a business plan and its
importance, the benefits of a having a clear business model.
Both parts help us to catch a clear view, of the importance of having a continuous
innovative approach in any entrepreneurial effort. In addition, we have realized that it is
crucial to learn to think in a different perspective. Think big – think globally – think
different. A number of essential meanings were further researched and developed, close
related to the abovementioned issues.
Finally, we conclude that it is necessary to incorporate and embrace these findings in our
future entrepreneurial standing.

Michael Raynor,
“The Strategy Paradox: Why committing to success leads to failure
[and what to do about it]”,

<-----Page 7----->CHAPTER 1 – Book Analysis
The traditional function of strategic planning which follows a specific procedure so far, is
proved inadequate in order to face the necessities of our era. According to the philosophy
of the author, this function needs to be re-invented, if the company would like to be more
flexible and effective.
Strategic planning includes two basic components: forecasting and commitment.
Although forecasting is a cornerstone of the strategic planning, it is impossible to forecast
as accurately, as it is required. Forecasting incorporates prediction, but prediction ignores
uncertainty. In addition, assumptions and extrapolations – parameters where usually
depends a strategic plan - are only a description of the future, as we perceive it, based in
the present circumstances. Nobody can foretell the future, as this is “a possibility space”
(according to Mr Raynor), where all possible outcomes may appear. One basic component
of the “possibility space” is the ubiquity of randomness. Therefore, in result a range of
outcomes may happen.
Uncertainty defines the strategic and operational environment today. We cannot tell where
the next threats will come from, and when they will materialize. [2]
The orientation of a company to the strategic success may sound an excellent target, but
hides possible obstacles, difficult to overcome when they appear. This happens as most
strategies are built on specific beliefs about the future. They are called expectations, but
should the future not turned out as expected, it is impossible for the company to adapt.
Excellent strategies can fail simply because the conditions, in which they are built on,
never happen.
The author in this book is presenting a number of real cases, where the common conclusion
is that the ingredients of success are the same as in failure. In fact, the prerequisites of
success are often the antecedents of failure. It sounds also as a paradox, but based in a
number of surveys, he has concluded that the best performing companies have much more

3

<-----Page 8----->in common with the failed ones, than with the mediocre. The only real difference between
them is “luck”, where luck signifies all the series of events that may go right or wrong, in a
way that the company could catch or not its targets.
Although many surveys have been done over a number of succeeding companies, and
various models on “how to succeed” were introduced, few have focused on failed ones.
Most of the times this happened as it were difficult to find available data for them.
However, this is a challenge. It is necessary to investigate on why “someone fails” rather
than on why “he succeeds”. This in-depth analysis may protect us while in parallel
enriching our perception’s criteria and give a more broaden approach.
Regarding the second component of strategic planning, commitment, it is mentioned that a
successful strategy allows an organization to create and capture value. A strategy by
default requires significant commitments, which are the strategic commitments.
Commitments are powerful determinants of success, because they make the strategy
difficult to be imitated by the competitors. In this way, the company acquires hard-to-copy,
hard-to-reverse configurations of resources. Commitment that changes is not a
commitment and it is declared in the book that strong commitments take time to bear fruits,
so they do need time to come true. However, commitments are not enough by themselves.
They may end to failure, if the strategy proved to be wrong. In addition, they cannot be
adapted should predictions prove incorrect. Companies that are pursuing the most
commitment-based strategies may have highest returns, but also may suffer from
catastrophe.
The strategy paradox is a consequence of the need to commit to a strategy despite the deep
uncertainty about which strategy to choose. This is the strategic uncertainty. Uncertainty
is not an afterthought. It has to be placed at the top of the decision making process, by the
highest managerial levels of the company.
The strategy paradox arises from the collision of commitment and uncertainty. The aim
should be to relate and manage those two, as successfully as possible. There is a need to
make strategic commitments in the face of strategic uncertainty.

4

<-----Page 9----->The strategy paradox is a structural problem. It is an inevitable consequence of the benefits
of making the right commitments with the impossibility of knowing if these are the right
ones.
In addition, adaptability cannot resolve the strategy paradox. To resolve this, a new way of
thinking and approach is required. Resolving the strategy paradox means wrestling more
effectively with the inescapable reality of unpredictable and potentially radically changing
future.
Adaptability is far less useful than we might like. Actually, it has limits. The bottom line is
to realize that adaptability is viable only when the pace of company’s change matches the
pace of the environmental change. In the situation that this change moves faster or slower,
where no match exists, adaptability is not sufficient. As mentioned above, companies
cannot adapt their commitments should the strategy turn out to be wrong. Something to
focus on is that, most competitive environments are characterized by multiple rates of
change, creating the impossible obligation for companies, to need to change at different
rates at the same time.
Forecasting as previously mentioned, has its limits as well. Past performance is not
necessarily an indicative of the future events. One more parameter is randomness. The
lack of order in combination with the free will, generates different actions and responses as
they follow diversified rules. Anyone who tries to predict in a long-term basis is wasting
his time. In addition, it is impossible to use forecasting in order to substitute the limits of
adaptability.
So far, we conclude that two major functions should be focused. The management of
commitments and the management of uncertainty. These should be two different things,
which will be delegated in different groups of people, within the company. It seems that
these two, appear to be the key elements for the company to learn to face the unexpected
future.
The effort to manage the strategic uncertainty has a critical importance for the company, as
it establishes the base to differentiate its value. It forces the company to find ways for

5

<-----Page 10----->mitigating risk, without compromising performance. To understand the meaning of
mitigating risk, first needs to clarify the equation between risk and return.
Adopting the traditional hierarchical model in management, where the upper level
management always plans for the company’s future and the middle and lower levels with
more operational and functional tasks, we can easily understand how this delegation could
take place.
Some people in the organization should have the responsibility of mitigating risk, while
others to provide exposure to promising opportunities for the company. Senior
management should focus its efforts to manage uncertainty, as they are responsible for
longer time horizons. In the book, we often find the use of the term “corporate office”,
meaning the top-level management of the company implying the CEO and the senior
management. There is a referral also in the shareholders and their expectations from the
managers.
Lower levels should focus on delivering on the commitments already in place, as they are
responsible for shorter periods. Time is the fragment. Time is the resource. Time is the
parameter, which divides the management of uncertainty from the management of
commitments. Upper level people go for uncertainty while lower level for commitments.
To face uncertainty, a CEO should occupy in building strategic options rather than making
strategic choices.
In other scientific approaches, it is underlined the need for separating the longer-term
robust strategies, from the shorter-term corporate strategy. It is wise for the organizations
that make their long-range planning, to adopt the use of simple scenario techniques to
explore their possible future and then develop suitable robust strategies to address these
outcomes. [3]
Somehow at this point is introduced the meaning of “requisite uncertainty”.
Requisite uncertainty provides the foundation for separating the management of
uncertainty from the management of commitment. Each level of the hierarchy is defined
by its relationship to managing strategic uncertainty.

6

<-----Page 11----->The degree of connection between:
o the hierarchical level,
o the time horizon and
o the degree of strategic uncertainty,
is the base upon managing uncertainty is delegated.
The principle of the “requisite uncertainty” helps top management to identify the
parameter of uncertainty as a necessity for the strategic planning and therefore incorporate
its management in the overall philosophy. The next step is a big challenge, as this
mentality obligates the company to change its organizational design, in order to allocate
responsibilities, according to the degree of relation due to uncertainty.
This model of management adopts the principle of requisite uncertainty.
Through this principle, it is clear that a well-functioning hierarchy of a company is
differentiated by the degree of strategic uncertainty that is addressed to.
The book suggests that a company should learn to face the unexpected, with the use of a
number of tools provided. These tools will give the strategic flexibility. Strategic flexibility
is the ability to implement the kinds of strategies that can deliver outstanding results, while
minimizing the company’s exposure to the vagaries of fate.
A traditional definition of strategic flexibility would say that it is the ability of firms to
respond and successively adapt to environmental changes. [4] [5]
We conclude that the author really things differently and gives a fairly wider meaning to
strategic flexibility as described below.
Strategic flexibility is the corporate framework, for managing strategic uncertainty through
the creation of strategic options. The author, adopts the traditional definition, but goes
further adding another dimension. We clearly realize that this is the major weapon to face
uncertainty and protect the company from “bad luck”, or otherwise, all those
uncontrollable events that may appear in random order. In addition, without strategic
flexibility the company cannot create superior value and sustainable competitive advantage.
[6]

7

<-----Page 12----->In a dynamic business environment, the most successful companies in terms of profitability
and growth are the ones with the highest dynamic capabilities. Among them is the strategic
flexibility. It is the toolkit to cope with uncertainty.
A genuinely flexible strategy has two primary ingredients: scenarios and real options.
Scenarios allow the company to take seriously the uncertainty of the future, while real
options make it possible to act in a manner calibrated to that uncertainty. To grow strategic
options, it is needed to create scenarios. Scenarios should be used as input in the strategic
planning process. This is the scenario-based planning, which is the responsibility of the
senior management, whom time horizons are long enough to contemplate strategic change.
In fact, there are limits of what can happen in a time horizon that is under consideration
each time. The proverb that “anything could happen” is not true according to Mr Raynor.
There are limits and the scenario building is a tool for determining which these limits are.
At the corporate level, the challenge is to build an optimal strategy for each of the possible
outcomes. To analyze these strategies, it is necessary to determine the core and contingent
elements of the company.
Scenarios serve to crystallize and preserve disagreement among the corporate office’s
team members about the future. This diversity of opinions, fosters an environment where
different scenarios with different descriptions and different futures are cultivated. As a
result, the company has a portfolio with a range of plausible future conditions, within
which possibly, the company might have to operate. Disagreement is not operating versus
consensus, as at this phase, disagreement raises fundamentally strategic questions.
In the book is introduced the Holveck’s framework for the strategic flexibility which has
four phases. [7]

Senior management should try to make simulations of possible future outcomes and design
relevant alternative strategic plans (create options). Each level of the hierarchy should
contribute from its own level, while the great challenge at this point is how to ensure that
each level makes the relevant contribution to every other in the company.
We are living in an inescapable world of trade-offs.
We consider the title of the book a good one, as it implies the radical approach of the
author to the issue of embracing uncertainty and put it in the core strategy of the
company. Alternatively, we will propose another title based on what we have understood
so far, which is the following:

“Managing requisite uncertainty: the trade-off between the present and the future”

(question 1)

9

<-----Page 14----->CHAPTER 2 – Further understandings & outcomes
The purpose of this book is to fuel the hope that although the future is uncertain, our fate
does no have to be. By reading it, we are exploring the differences between a strategy on
hubris and a strategy on humility, while in the end the conclusion is that a strategy based
on humility is a better and nobler way to think about the future of a company. A strategy
totally devoted to success may lead to failure, if the parameter of uncertainty is overlooked.
Strategy and futurity are inextricably bound together. Therefore, in result, the challenge is
of thinking clearly about a future we cannot see.
The book suggests that instead of committing in one win-loose strategy, it is better
working more by handling a portfolio of strategic options. Nobody can predict the future
but instead may work on possible scenarios to create strategic options. Uncertainty needs
to be embraced. Fortune favors the prepared minds.
(question 2)
This book is addressed to the managers of all levels within a company. As described in the
above pages, all levels need to contribute and participate in this philosophy. A small
emphasis is given to the upper level management though, as these are the people who will
decide to incorporate or not the principle of requisite uncertainty and the toolkit of strategic
flexibility in the company’s strategic planning.
(question 3)
A number of cases were presented, Sony-Matsushita-Microsoft-J&J, where analysed the
success or fail in a number of products. Although this analysis sometimes was too deep as
much space of the book devoted to this, technical details and differences in strategic
approaches each time defined the result.
We have learnt never to underestimate the future outcome. It is an area where we have to
study more, in order to be prepared. As there are limits in adaptability and forecasting for a
company, in the same way, there are limits on what could happen in the future. The issue is
to learn to face the uncertainty by embracing it, through a number of principles and the use
of required toolkits. A change of philosophy is requested.
(question 4)
10

<-----Page 15----->If we could mention a number of new words that we have learnt from this book, these will
be the following:
► Strategy paradox:

strategies with the greatest possibility of success have the
greatest possibility of failure.

► Strategic uncertainty:

the need to commit to a strategy despite the fact that we do
not really know which strategy to follow.

► Strategic flexibility:

means the ability to change strategy according to a portfolio
of alternative strategies that create real options for the
company.

► Strategic commitments: a strategy to be implemented with possible success needs
commitments, these are called strategic commitments.
► Possibility space:

this contains the probability of any given event to happen at
any given point in the future, which means all possible
outcomes.

► Ubiquity of randomness: events are subject to inevitable randomness (randomness
means lack of order or pattern).
► Requisite uncertainty:

according to the author, to survive, a company must
differentiate the management of uncertainty from the
management of commitment. Requisite uncertainty is the
framework-the principle, which will help the company to
obtain this.

In fact, these words are not entirely new, though the approach and the relation between
them lead us to the fact of accepting them as new ones.
(question 5)
To avoid standing in the middle (mediocre), it is essential to learn walking in the edge.
Exposure to high risks means high returns and high rate of failure. If we do not accept
failure, we will not learn how to innovate. Failure is not a fear but a challenge. Companies
need to change constantly on every aspect of their activities. This is a common approach
analysed also in the unit’s lecture as well as at the book, where a change in the perception
of how a strategic planning should developed, is introduced. In addition, modern
entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship incorporate the task to learn facing uncertainty

11

<-----Page 16----->(strategic uncertainty), while in parallel try to find ways to handle it (requisite uncertainty
– strategic flexibility). What the author is suggesting here is that for a company to gain
growth and prosperity needs to embrace uncertainty and adopt it as a part of its living
process. Innovation targets to company’s growth. Innovation and entrepreneurship opens
windows of opportunities, which are necessary especially when a company is obliged to reinvent its strategic planning. No need to mention that innovation as a philosophy may
unfold in all hierarchical levels and create the conditions for a company to manage both
uncertainty and commitments. Creativity and ideas generation, may be proved valuable
assets, for a company that needs to adjust its pace of change with the environmental
changes. Brainstorming and focus groups, are important components for the upper level
management (the corporate office), whose responsibility is to create options, prepare the
environment and mitigate risk through scenario-based strategies. Minimizing the exposure
of the company to “bad luck” means, a flexible organizational culture, acquisition and
adoption of technological advancements, innovative spirits, open minds and willingness for
taking risk.
So far, we assume that a number of links have already been mentioned between the unit
and the book.
(question 6)
It is interesting that the author succeeds in giving a full-blooded description of his thoughts
from the beginning of the book. Starting from the traditional philosophy of how the
strategic planning is currently designed, he unfolds his thoughts through critical thinking,
comparisons and reviews based in cases and previous findings of other scientists. He
indicates the strategy paradox because of the need to commit in the face of unavoidable
uncertainty. A number of alternatives are examined, while the conclusion is the necessity
for separation between the management of commitment and the management of
uncertainty. These two factors have to be focused in order for a company to learn to face
the unexpected. Requisite uncertainty, is the new principle introduced and the critically
important tool for applying it, is the strategic flexibility. Top management should occupy
with the management of uncertainty, while operating managers should focus on delivering
on commitments.
(question 7)

12

<-----Page 17----->While strategy requires commitment, much about the future is simply unknowable. So far,
strategic planning is mostly based on predictions. Whole strategies of companies are based
on assumptions and forecasts demanding high commitments, dedication and consensus by
the people. But what happens when the strategy turn out to be the wrong one. In this book,
the author introduces the balance between commitment and flexibility in a world of
increasing uncertainty. By widening our focus from simply the pursuit of success to
include the ever-present uncertainty, we will achieve the growth and sustainability of the
company. Obtaining greatness, means accepting some failure. Pursuing high return, means
exposure to high risk. The “strategy paradox” is a guide for managing risk.
(question 8)
It is true that by the end of reading, one main idea is alive. Uncertainty is not our enemy
but a challenge, which we have to learn how to embrace it. By incorporating uncertainty
in the company’s strategic planning, we achieve to prepare it for the future.
(question 9)
As previously underlined, this book develops a new philosophy and approach of how to
interact with uncertainty and how to face it. In appendix B we present a model of the
strategy paradox as we perceive it, considering that an one-page illustration of the most
important elements of this philosophy are easier to kept in mind and learn.
(question 10)
In our effort to transfer the whole concept of the book 200 years earlier, which means
during the 18th century, we are trying to simulate a number of bone-meanings and their
possible differentiation now and then. The idea of planning is the same. Future action plans
and their design in the present circumstances remain in the same philosophy. Uncertainty
was always the unknown parameter and pursuing ways to overcome it a necessity.
Therefore, the backbone (first five chapters) of the book is the same for both eras. The
differentiation starts from the methods we can use to incorporate uncertainty in the core
strategy of a company. Nowadays, the available tools with the presence of technology are
much more innovative and effective. Strategic flexibility and the framework to deal with
the management of uncertainty and management of commitments, can find significant
technical support.

13

<-----Page 18----->Probably the changes would be in the set of tools that we would propose if we had lived on
that period. More or less in the same manner, we concluded in the previous technical report
that have been submitted for the module of “Knowledge Society & ICT Policy”, where the
subject was related to the Communities of Practice. The idea of using Communities of
practice as a tool in the companies was the same throughout the years. The changes that
took place were mostly related to the incremental availability of a number of technological
advancements during the years.
(question 11)
The book starts with the conclusion that strategies with the greatest possibility of success
have the greatest possibility of failure. This is the strategy paradox. In the first chapter of
the book it is covered the meaning of what is the strategy paradox (What Strategy
Paradox?), who is responsible to face it and when this may take place. In the next chapters
2, 3, 4 and 5 a number of parameters are presented strictly connected with the why this
happen (The Best-Laid Plans, Who dares wins or loses, The limits of adaptability, The
limits of forecasting). Next chapters, until the end of the book (chapters 6-11) are
addressed on how to resolve the strategy paradox effectively and what to do in order to
incorporate its philosophy within the company’s strategic planning.
In the appendix of this report, there is a representation of the book’s contents for the clear
understanding of how the book is organized. (Appendix A).
Regarding the 4W’s and the one H, we adopt a more in-book approach and try to match
these questions with the main idea of it. Not to forget that the cause is uncertainty.
 Who, is responsible to face the strategy paradox
 What, is the strategy paradox?
 When, this take place
 Why, strategy paradox happens
 How, to resolve the strategy paradox
(question 12)

14

<-----Page 19----->Great strategy requires having a bold vision of the future. However, the future is uncertain
and cannot be predicted. Therefore, a great strategy may fail. For this reason, uncertainty
has to be incorporated at the core of the strategy. The smart way to prepare for an uncertain
future is to develop a portfolio of strategic options. Core competences of the company have
to be used as a platform. The highest managerial levels should occupy with creating
options rather than making commitments. Full commitment to the execution of a specific
strategy, should occur at the functional level.
(question 13)
The book is separated in two parts. In the first one (the first five chapters) the author
presents the philosophy of the strategy paradox, giving and analyzing a number of cases. A
number of reasons are discussed and uncertainty resides in the center of this analysis. In
the second part, which in our opinion is the most exiting and interesting part of the book
(the rest six chapters), the author develops his proposal on how to embrace uncertainty and
place it in the center of a company’s strategy. Suggestions are real, based on facts and
experiences while additional meanings of current management are used to combine his
thoughts with the scientific aspect of resolving the strategy paradox.

Hotmail: Delivering e-mail to the world

16

<-----Page 21----->CHAPTER 3 – Case analysis and outcomes
3.1 How did Hotmail come to develop its unique business idea? What light does this
throw on the process of detecting an opportunity for a new business venture?
Both Hotmail founders (Mr Sabeer Bhatia and Mr Jack Smith), were involved in the new
technology era, as they worked for Apple and later on in other Silicon
Valley companies. The early 90s was a milestone for the companies involved with the
new technologies. The years followed were characterized by the digital freedom and the
continuous technological advancements, open to the public.
As the business environment was changing, new opportunities were born for those who
had the foreseeing to grab and turn them into ventures. A number of start-up companies
had already begun to open the road showing the path for adopting new perspectives. Bhatia
was inspired by the “Silicon Valley dream” and he was sure that his ideas had the
characteristics of being an opportunity to launch a firm.
In addition, he demonstrated a strong entrepreneurial spirit, since he was passionate of
pursuing opportunities in the specific industry. On the one side he was frustrated with his
current job, while on the other side, he was energetic, self-confident and most of all
persuasive, as he finally managed to persuade his colleague Jack Smith to accept his idea
of launching together the start-up firm.
Therefore, at the beginning there was a common motive. They both wanted to pursue their
own ideas. In general, to become an entrepreneur three primary reasons are responsible: (a)
to be your own boss, (b) to pursue your own ideas and (c) to realize financial awards. [8]
All of the above count here, but mostly the second one. At this case, the founders would
like to build something more important and that was the big challenge for them. Passion
and commitment were identified in their extraordinary behavior, as they kept on working
with full dedication, no matter the obstacles. We have concluded that their wish was to
create an entrepreneurial start up firm rather than a salary-substitute or a lifestyle. They
wanted to create value and then disseminate this value to their potential customers.
17

<-----Page 22----->They did not quit their regular jobs, but instead preferred to work in parallel. An
entrepreneur is usually a moderate risk taker, thus he chooses to act under specific
constraints, which guarantees a sort of security. However, working under constraints
implying new ways of thinking and innovative approaches.
The primary idea was to create a database for storing personal information over the internet.
They named this product Javasoft. Not as innovative, as it was beard out in the end.
Next, they started to look for funding. In order to pursue for financing, the entrepreneur
must have in mind a number of criteria that usually the investors are asking.
9 Experience in the area of the proposed business
9 Skills and abilities that will help the business
9 A solid reputation
9 A record of accomplishment of success
9 Passion about the idea
Their primary presentations to the potential investors failed, as they received more than 20
rejections. All failures pointed two elements: (a) the idea seemed to lack distinctiveness
and (b) both the founders had lack of experience.
There is a difference between an opportunity and an idea. Simply generating ideas is not
adequate, since this is not combined with recognizing opportunities. An idea may not meet
the criteria of an opportunity. Therefore, there are three ways to identify an opportunity:
[9]
• By observing trends
• By solving a problem
• By finding a gap in the marketplace
By observing trends, it is possible to identify business opportunities. Forces that affect the
trends are the economic factors, social factors, technological advances, political action and
regulatory statuses. At this case, we have recognized crucial changes in some of these areas,
which meant a formation of new environment. In 1995, the financial situation in US

18

<-----Page 23----->became better after an economic recession. Since 1994, the full privatization of NSF
(National Science Infrastructure) network opened the new medium of internet for
commercial activity. It is important to remember that during the past years, the use of
technology and the network - later known as internet - was a prominent area only for the
army, the governmental services and slightly for the academic community. As a result, this
public-oriented change caused the birth of a number of Silicon Valley companies, which
were introducing highly improved technological products. The proliferation of computers
and the globalization of industries created a new framework for people. Therefore, almost
all forces had cooperated to guide the society to a technology-driven future.
As mentioned earlier, the founders had decided to introduce a web-based database software
but this idea did not work out. They return but they did not retreat. They were selfconfident with tolerance in ambiguity and optimistic disposition. They agreed that, to
continue working for improving their idea, was the right think. Therefore, next step was to
improve their idea and their business plan and afterwards continue searching for potential
investors. An opportunity must be attractive, durable, timely and anchored in a product,
service or business that creates or ads value for its customer. [10]
They continued their regular jobs and started to exchange plans and ideas for improvement
through their business e-mail addresses. This was too risky. They were already employed
and as regular employees, they were afraid of possible monitoring from the company.
Therefore, they decided to use their personal AOL e-mails. They had bad luck though, as
the company put a firewall system in its IT structure so no other e-mails could be used,
except their business one. That was a real problem at a very significant timing for them.
While facing technical obstacles in their simple demand for internal personal
communication, this was the spotlight for a different product. Through their “solving a
problem” mentality, and having an adequate knowledge background, they decided to grab
the idea and turn it into business opportunity. Every problem is a brilliantly disguised
opportunity.
Jack Smith tried to combine their database software with the HTML technology, which
was known and recently introduced. A serendipitous discovery is a chance discovery
made by someone with a prepared mind.

19

<-----Page 24----->They had concluded that their new service should be a web-based email. Having the
knowledge, they realized that could easily adapt their Javasoft database to store and display
e-mail messages, as HTML documents, via regular internet browsers. Furthermore, there
was no real competition at such service, so there was definitely a gap in the marketplace.
Both their personal characteristics in combination with the environmental trends drove
them to the opportunity recognition. They continued to search for investors but now they
had in mind the protection of their idea from being stolen. Therefore, they decided to
follow a scenario of investigating more closely their potential investors. The process of due
diligence usually is operating both wards. Not only the investors but the potential firm as
well, may scrutinize a number of replies that will receive from its potential investors,
before accepting the funds.
In a continuous changing environment, the two entrepreneurs kept pursuing their ideas
with passion, commitment and strong entrepreneurial spirit; they had identified an
opportunity and turned it into a viable business. By observing and solving, they managed
to turn their first moderate idea into a most-promising opportunity. As a result, they were
rewarded in their effort to innovate by introducing a new service in the technology
industry.

3.2 What resource constraints were faced by Hotmail and how did the
entrepreneurs overcome them?
The “burn rate” is the rate at which a company is spending its capital, until it reaches
profitability. At this case, the firm burned through its available funding a little after its
start-up, but before the launch of its service and the emerging of profitability. As a result,
there were not many opportunities but to ask for additional financing from its investors.
The founders decided to keep their financial status as it was in order not to diminish their
share in the agreement with their investors. Instead, they preferred to bootstrap, which
means they tried to find creative ways to self-finance the project. Usually at this stage,
entrepreneurs had to recruit their abilities in creativity, ingenuity, thriftiness, cost cutting

20

<-----Page 25----->and any mean necessary to ensure the viability of their project. In this case, founders
succeeded in persuading their staff (fifteen employees approximately) to continue working
only for stock options. Through this cost-cutting action, they achieved the continuous
operation of Hotmail without additional cash for several weeks. Both founders were
persistent in succeeding in their targets so a highly innovative approach was adopted to
overcome the barriers.

3.3 What led to the adoption of viral marketing? Were there any dangers associated
with this decision? If so, could anything have been done to reduce these?
The luck of funds affected not only the preparatory period of the firm’s launch, but also its
advertising plan. Usually it is impossible to start a company without a budget to use for
any kind of advertisement. The founders had to bootstrap also at this case. Somehow, an
investment in marketing tools had to be done but no additional funds existed. At this point,
the venture capital firm helped them essentially to overcome this obstacle. The suggestion
was to add in the bottom line of each e-mail a single line where to invite any interested
people to sign in Hotmail to acquire a free e-mail account.
Truly that was a bold action especially in the period introduced. There was much of
skepticism among the founders. Actually, they were reluctant even to think about this
option. Further consideration and discussion with the venture capitalists persuade them that
this would be nothing different from a simple banner ad. It was possible for them to face
legal problems, which had happened at similar cases, as the idea of spam advertisement did
not fit with the internet culture at that time.
Luck of funding directed them to viral marketing. They decided to make some technical
changes in the original idea in a way that possibly could not bother their users. This change
proved to be crucial in the end. That was an innovative idea, which was copied by many
companies in later years.
They took the risk and got their return. Immediate users base growth. In addition, they had
a steady increase through time in user numbers, proving that Hotmail would have a
continuous development. High risk means high exposure but this can bring high returns.

21

<-----Page 26----->They could not do anything else than undertaking a risk which could lead them either to
failure or success.

3.4 How was Hotmail supported and constrained by the network in which it was
embedded?
One way for financing a start-up firm is through equity funding. Under this occasion
founders accept to give part of their ownership interest to the investor and eventually this
means part of the control. Hotmail preferred to receive its financing through a venture
capital firm. Venture capital is money that usually invested in start-up companies. The
venture capitalists know that their investments are of high risk, so they try to keep their
portfolio of companies equilibrated.
Usually due to nature of their job, they are well-connected with the market; they know the
business world and thus can support a new firm with much more than funding. They
maintain a portfolio of potential customers, they know companies that can help or bring
together to achieve a target, they have governmental links as well as a significant social
capital which, if stimulated correctly may result in potential growth and profits.
Surveys of both venture capitalists and entrepreneurs consistently indicate that venture
capitalists are seen as most important, in innovative early stage ventures, when the
entrepreneurs have limited experience and when venture capitalists usually hold a
relatively large equity share. [11]
For a start-up company all these components are extremely necessary. In this case, the
venture capital firm “Draper Fisher Jurventson” had all the abovementioned characteristics
and furthermore, its managers were already familiar with the internet-based start-up firms.
In addition, there is another component, which is developed through daily process and
follows a number of practices. This is the entrepreneurial learning and refers to modes of
learning based in reflection and action. There are two modes the hypothesis-testing and the
hermeneutic, where in the first the learning process starts with reflection which leads to
action, while in the second, action often precedes learning and reflection. [12]

22

<-----Page 27----->The role of venture capitalists includes transfer of foresight knowledge, elicitation of
understanding and a contribution to create a platform for future learning activities. As a
result, venture capitalists add value to the firm and their actions are considered of key
importance.
Hotmail gained a lot, from the experience of the venture capital firm, accepted serious help
in a number of obstacles during its growth and got advantage of the strategic alliance
established with Four11 by using its clients’ network. Nevertheless, as discussed earlier,
the nature of funding sometimes defines the future of a firm. Strategic alliances are not
charitable organisations. They are arrangements between commercial organisations with a
view to gain. [13]
The venture capital firm had always an exit strategy, which should be rewarded. In any
case investors had always an exit strategy in their plans, and this is a milestone in their
initial willingness when funding a start-up company. At that case, this would mean the
possibility of selling Hotmail in the near future to a bigger potential competitor.
When you have such a constraint, there is no space for more radical innovative actions. For
example, it could be a possible scenario to ally Hotmail with a company from a different
industry cluster, making a powerful innovative network, dependent on new combinations
of knowledge. The choice of a partner is an important factor affecting alliance performance
and firms’ future. Instead, a more narrow alliance proposed, based only in the common
nature of firms aiming in mutually expanding their customers’ databases.
Hotmail stayed locked into a frame defined by its venture capital firm and its alliance. It
should have gone for the exploration of its competencies. This could direct the company to
harvest ideas and expertise from a wide array of sources. From the case, showed that both
founders and employees were high qualified, innovative and willing to take the risk.
No company is smart enough to know what to do with every opportunity it finds, and no
company has enough resources to pursue all opportunities it might execute. [14]
In the case of Hotmail and Four11, we know that the alliance was encouraged by their
common venture capitalist. Based only in some of their common elements, both firms
23

<-----Page 28----->agreed to proceed, recognising that the alliance could support their pursuance for
sustainability and growth. By evaluating what happened in the end, both start-ups were
sold with high profits to Microsoft and Yahoo, rewarding first the initial investment of the
venture capital firm and then the founders of Hotmail and Four11. At this stage, it is not
clear if the exit strategy of the venture capital firm was fully adopted by the founders of
Hotmail. We know that Mr Bhatia demonstrated for once more strong negotiation skills to
raise the price. If this was, what they really wanted, the network where Hotmail was
embedded, operated successfully with high rewards in the end. If not, as mentioned above,
Hotmail got stacked in a relationship that probably restrained its potentials for further
growth and domination of the e-mail industry services.
The worst-case scenario should be that, as Hotmail had a value, and the venture capitalists
identified this at the very early stage, this was used by them to improve the value of Four11.
In the end, having two valuable assets in their portfolio instead of one, would enormously
increase the potential of getting high returns in its investment.

3.5 Most specifically, comment on the advantages and disadvantages of strategic
partnerships in the light of Hotmail’s experience with Four11.
Hotmail and Four11 had made a strategic alliance, which is one of the most common types
of business partnerships. A strategic alliance is a kind of arrangement that establishes an
exchange relationship but has no joint ownership involved. It exists for a number of
reasons: ►to share risk (reaching economies of scale and scope could be faster than doing
it alone), ►to gain access to resources (exchange/transfer technology), ►to grow and
►to gain a long-term strategic advantage (to learn or to shape competition).
Global competition and continuous technological changes dictates a relevant re-structuring
across companies. The idea of a firm, collaborating with one or multiple other firms,
proved to be a very useful tool. Starting in the early 90s, especially in the technologyoriented start up firms, companies incorporated this idea into their strategies and
participated in organisational networks.

24

<-----Page 29----->There were a number of surveys on that period about hi-tech start-up firms, which
concluded that most of the partnerships were forced in order for the participated firms to
develop and survive. Therefore, some of them succeeded but others failed due to strategic
misfit or due to badly implementation. Simply they were made for the wrong reasons. [15]
Possibly the strategic alliance established in this case had no the full characteristics of a
necessary one, at least by the data given and the main reason mentioned. A strategic
alliance should foresee in much more advantages than the one of penetrating in the
other’s market.
The establishment of strategic alliances gives a number of advantages to the concerned
firms, which are:
• to lower overhead costs
• to obtain new technologies
• to increase responsiveness to customers
• to enhance quality
• to enter new markets
• to increase their flexibility
• to increase firms’ value
As understood, such benefits can help them to be more flexible and adaptable to rapidly
changing environments. Trust and cooperative learning are critical factors that affect the
success of a strategic alliance. [16] Intangible assets such as relationships and knowledge
should be managed by the alliance with the same care, such with tangible assets. [17]
But as many other tools, establishing a partnership demands a number of components that
had to be continuously re-examined. Issues such as ►the building of relationships,
►mutually-rewarding deals, ►compatible values and goals, ►appropriate balance of
freedom and control, are important and must be under continuous revision.
Potential partner firms at this stage, had to secure and negotiate their nature of relationship,
recognise their independence, be willing to share information, be willing to co-operate,
invest in the development of inter-firm capabilities, invest in good-faith and trust, utilise

25

<-----Page 30----->effectively the human resource and be able to successfully compete other network
organisations. To discuss upon this, further surveys are necessary to be made by both allies
such as, the close proximity of the firms, the similarity of cultures, the relative size and
position of the firms (e.g. if they are relatively small or emerging firms), the rapid growth
in the industry and the initial timing of the relationship.
Proximity does not necessarily mean that firms have to operate in the same field or
industry, but rather that their core strategies should have common characteristics and
compatible mentalities. It is necessary prior to any kind of partnership, for each ally to reexamine the strategic rationale of the other and to identify which are the real business
needs of establishing this partnership. In addition, a shared vision, a clear communication
and collaborative sharing of expertise have to be parts of both firms’ core strategies.
Establishment of alliances may guide to potential benefits but sometimes hide pitfalls.
To conclude, when investigating a possible strategic alliance three integral components
have to be monitored: [18]
1. Creation of the alliance/strategic issues
2. Maintenance of the alliance/relationship issues
3. Performance of the alliance/evaluation issues

Future partners must not overlook, that a strategic alliance dictates creating a truly
collaborative working relationship with strong social, economic, service and technical ties.
Not to forget that an emphasis should be given in constantly look for the value that a
partnership creates.
At this case, the alliance primarily was encouraged by the venture capital firm. This was
based mostly in the potential of mutually exchanging their clients’ databases and the
penetration in each one’s market. We conclude that there were no deep thoughts on the
establishment of such relationship and the approach was rather surface. The effort to
succeed in a social embeddedness on market efficiencies locked the two partners into an
unproductive relationship.

26

<-----Page 31----->3.6 What was the role of the venture capitalist in this case? Were there any
asymmetries in the relationship with Hotmail?
As discussed above, the venture capital firm in this case:
(a) Had experience in internet-based start up companies
(b) Had prior investments in similar companies
Recalling some points, a start-up company needs to review a number of things, regarding
the selection of its future venture capitalist. Queries to be replied are:
(a) Whether the investors have prior experience in the specific industry
(b) What kind of management is willing to apply, active or passive?
(c) Do the investors seem compatible personalities with the founders of the firm?
(d) Do they have enough resources to support the start-up firm?
(e) Is there a good faith and the potential of mutual trust regarding the financial
arrangements or not?
We would say that first; the specific venture capitalists had experience in the industry of
technology. From the case, it is clear that they had an active management role. Although in
the primary stage of the deal, regarding the funding of the company, it seemed that the
venture capitalists had made a retreat in the requirements of Mr Bhatia (he was a strong
negotiator), they had in their minds the path they would follow.
For them, the strategic alliance would increase the value of their investment in Four11,
through the mutual engagement with Hotmail. Hotmail had a steady increasing
development and could work supportively to Four11, while in opposite, Four11 as it was
“a help people to find people” start-up firm could give its database to Hotmail. This move
would add to the value chain of both companies. Four11 would send its customers to
Hotmail to acquire a free e-mail account and Hotmail would send its customers to register
in the vast database of Four11.
At the critical point, where Hotmail had already expanded, there were two options
regarding its relationship with Four11. Either to merge or to separate. The definitive

27

<-----Page 32----->decision of Four11 to develop its own e-mail platform, almost was supported by the
venture capital firm, which actually would have two promising companies in the
technology arena. As said before, the e-mail service idea of Hotmail, was entirely new and
the competition non-existant. There was enough space for competitors to get in.
For a venture capitalist, there is always an exit strategy.
It was more than obvious that such start-ups sometime would attract the “big fishes”,
which would be willing to pay more for decisions they did not take in the past. Needless to
say that, companies such as Microsoft had not decided to enter in this service although they
had the opportunities, as they viewed it as unproven and risky.
Although quick investments tend to produce more failures, this is not diminishing venture
capitalists’ returns. It is well known that the property of increasing returns in hightechnology industries tends to generate a large first-mover advantage and lead to a winnertake-all situation. Thus, quick investment has a better chance to produce highly successful
start-ups. [19]
Two companies could return more money than one.
At the end of 2007, the venture capital firm held a significant portfolio of stakes in both
start-ups. Both firms had the 64% of global users in their customers’ database. They were
the dominants of e-mail services at that time.
When the two start-ups became head-to-head competitors, an internal restructuring made
within the venture capital firm. The two venture capitalists separate their duties and agreed
to manage one company each. That was necessary to avoid illegal or unethical actions.
This relationship was asymmetric. Hotmail instead of getting full advise and support from
its venture capital firm, it had to share it with a competitor. That was simply incompatible
and could raise issues of good faith. In other words, there could be problems of asymmetric
information. The house style of an investment can influence the performance of both the
investor and the investee. In addition, it may define the nature of their relationship. [20]

28

<-----Page 33----->3.7 What alternative business models might Hotmail have adopted? How would
these have affected resource requirements and subsequent learning in the firm?
A business model defines the company’s behaviour. It is a plan of how it competes, uses
its resources, structures its relationships, interfaces with customers and creates value to
sustain profitability. For a company to maintain its sustainability, it is necessary to have
a clear business model. Thus, to realise on a daily basis, (a) how the operations of the
business as a whole fit together, (b) what is the outcome and if this is feasible, (c) why the
people who are participating in this effort are willing to work together and (d) which is the
core logic of the firm. A business model has four components: [21]
1. Core strategy
2. Strategic resources
3. Partnership network
4. Customer interface
Following this rule of components, we are trying to match them with the data in the case
and investigate whether the business model used was a successful one or there would have
been used some alternatives.
Regarding the core strategy, the company had a clear mission statement; to provide “free
e-mail to everyone”. Thus, easy communication at no cost. Their service would be, to offer
to their customers an easy way of sending and receiving personal e-mails via web browsers.
By the time they had decided to launch their start up firm, there was no real competition.
However, their basis of differentiation was to offer this service free and get their income
from advertisements placed in their web platform.
Their strategic resources were their core competencies regarding database and e-mail
technologies. A core competency of a company is something that it can do better than the
others. It is its competitive advantage. In Hotmail they had made a unique communication
platform, valuable for their customers (as they received more for nothing), difficult to
imitate for their level of expertise and surely transferable to new opportunities, as they had
the capacity to adapt it any time to any requests or demands by their customers. In addition,
both founders have proved their technical adequacy when serious technical problems rose
during the offer of the service. In addition, while Jack Smith proved to be an excellent

29

<-----Page 34----->engineer with high technical background, Bhatia seemed to have more interpersonal skills
as he proved to be a great negotiator with strong characteristics of an entrepreneur.
We consider the founders and their highly qualified staff as the major strategic asset in
their business model. The combination of the highly qualified staff with the service and
its value chain, was really what created value to this company.
For a new company, it is difficult to start without some kind of business partnership that
would help it in some way. In this case, founders with the liaison of their common venture
capital firm, decided to develop a different key relationship through a strategic alliance
with Four11, an also start up firm with parallel activities with Hotmail in the same industry.
Through this alliance, which had some kind of mutual benefits, Hotmail gained access to
the Four11’s market while the same happened for the opposite side. So both benefited
from a faster and low-cost market penetration simply by exchanging access to their
target markets.
Perhaps it would be a suggestion to Hotmail not to ally only with Four11, although they
had a common investor. As seemed in the end, Four11 became a head-to-head competitor
to Hotmail increasing its value from one side, jeopardising and cancelling their cooperation.
This alliance by no means benefited the venture capital firm, especially when decided to
implement its exit strategy by selling both companies to bigger customers (Microsoft and
Yahoo), but did not necessary helped Hotmail.
The superiority of Hotmail’s company value was used for the shake of increasing income
by the venture capital firm. It seemed that Hotmail had a loss of decision autonomy or at
least their founders did not implement an effective due diligence to the venture capital firm
before accepting the proposed alliance.
On the other side, in case they have chosen to “walk alone” probably they could not take
advantage of resources and expertise, which gained from this cooperation and we mean
both from Four11 and their venture capitalists.

30

<-----Page 35----->Usually one-partner alliances incorporate the high risk of dependency, possible loss of
proprietary information and rise of problems derived from the meshing of cultures.
At a point we would suggest to Hotmail to differentiate its partnership network by focusing
in broaden alliances with multiple benefits.
Regarding the company’s customer interface, we could say that it was an asset as they
were mostly customer-oriented on every aspect of their daily operation. Their target market
were all potential users of internet globally, their fulfilment and support had a high value of
dedication to what their users wanted and the whole concept was delivered for free to the
users.

3.8 Should Hotmail forge a strategic link with Four11? Why or why not?
As it is said in the stock markets, if you cannot handle your emotions it is better to do
another job instead of gambling or investing. [22] For the founders it was rather a premature decision to enter in an alliance even before entering into the market. It was proved
that, beyond the fact that Hotmail could take advantage of the Four11’s directory nothing
else gained by this link, at least for Hotmail.
A strategic link should incorporate multiple reasons to exist and the creation of a more
widen and complex framework of factors. The link with Four11 could happen some time
after the launch of Hotmail, but it was not wise to be the only one. We realise that this link
was more or less a “lock partners” model, where actually Hotmail was blocked from other
possibly more useful collaborations. [23]
This single channel collaboration with Four11 possibly brought some advantages but in
parallel restricted the potential alliances with others. It seemed that the third reason of
establishing this alliance “the VC would benefit indirectly through increasing activity of its
investee firms” was the strongest one.
A strategic alliance may embrace a diversity of components under which the allies could
be benefited in any case. A number of them are given below: [24]

31

<-----Page 36----->•

Gaining access to new technologies

•

Acquiring means of distribution

•

Market seeking

•

Learning and internalization of tacit, collective and embedded skills

•

Obtaining economies of scale

•

Diversifying into new businesses

•

Restructuring and improving performance

•

Cost sharing and pooling of resources

•

Developing products, technologies and resources

•

Achieving vertical integration, recreating and extending supply links in order to
adjust to environmental changes

•

Risk reduction and risk diversification

•

Developing technical standards

•

Achieving competitive advantage

•

Following industry trends

•

Complementarity of goods and services to markets

We conclude that Hotmail did not get advantage of the enormous capabilities,
opportunities that could derive from possible successful alliances, therefore, did not tap
effectively into resources, skills, and knowledge that could benefited it. They should link
with Four11 but this should not have been their only alliance.

3.9 Why was Hotmail valued at nearly $400 million when it was sold to Microsoft in
December 1997, only two years after foundation?
At the end of 2007, after two successful strategic choices of the founders, (a) to introduce
and use viral marketing, which directed to immediate growth and (b) to improve their
internal technology used to handle the vast amount of emails through a scalability
approach, Hotmail had a portfolio of 8 million active mailboxes. The most important
though was that the company could handle much more users based on their current
structuring. That was the spotlight for Microsoft. Although the initial offer of Microsoft
was $100 million, after the interference of Bhatia’s negotiation skills, this offer raised to
approximately $400 million.
32

<-----Page 37----->The key point was the hidden capacity of Hotmail to manage more users and the intuition
of Microsoft that the market had great opportunities for further growth. In addition, this
could be used as a ready-made supportive service to the already successful platform of
Microsoft’s applications.

3.10 What you would do differently (if you were Bhatia and Smith) and why?
It is important to distinct between the different finance providers operating in the market.
We will adopt the sayings of European Commission and agree on that, “Entrepreneurs
must be able to access the right financing, at the right price, at the right place and at the
right time to develop their companies and ideas”. In addition, as we have already
identified, an entrepreneur should scrutinise his potential investors before reaching to an
agreement. Getting financing is a process that operates both wards for the firm and the
potential investor.

We realise that a start-up firm needs different kind of financing in its different lifestages. It is clear that, according to the nature of its financing, a start-up firm will enter into
a different network of investors, business angels, venture capitalists, implying different
advantages and disadvantages in each of these models. This is one major issue and
decision for the entrepreneurs. To investigate which model is the most appropriate for them
each time.
On the other hand, it is clear that a business plan is a dual-purpose document. It serves as a
“road map” for the inside people of the firm and an introduction of the business
opportunity for the outside potential investors. It is not a static bible but a dynamically
adapted document that drives the firm throughout time.
Therefore, a clear understanding of the business model and the environment of potential
investors should be under further consideration and entrepreneurs are expected to decide
the most effective financing model for their ideas.

33

<-----Page 38----->We suggest that Hotmail’s founders should narrow their potential investors list, searching
preferably to a network of business angels rather than venture capitalists, especially
during the launching period of their firm. At that stage, they needed mostly a seed capital
rather than a venture capital support. Venture capital firms serve the later phases of wealth
creation. [25] Different model of financing at different stages seems that it could be a
more convenient way, which could guarantee higher returns and satisfaction for both
founders.
From the case reading, it is clear that both Microsoft and Yahoo would like to buy part of
the services that the start-ups offered. The venture capital firm instead, saw this willingness
as an exit opportunity and tried to push the things in a different path, thus to sell the
companies as whole entities.
We suggest that Hotmail instead, should seek partnerships with diversification standards,
in order to penetrate in a more innovative way in different markets, strengthening its
position and acquiring characteristics of a dominant firm. In addition, we would suggest a
scenario-based strategy where it would include the following guidelines: [26]
•

To assimilate the competencies of the potential partner

•

To think of the partner as today’s ally and tomorrow’s competitor

•

To share power and resources but share information wisely and

•

To structure the alliance carefully

We consider that these paths if were adopted, would benefit more Hotmail, would raise its
value and would guarantee sustainability of the firm.

34

<-----Page 39----->CONCLUSIONS
The study of both parts helped us to have a thorough understanding of the nature of
entrepreneurship and innovation. They were good examples and initiatives to continue
exploiting the “possibility space” regarding the link between these two major components
of our changing environment.
This report aims to develop a framework where to survey a number of skills and
competencies closely related with the innovative approach and the entrepreneurial process.
We feel that it is a milestone in the non-stop process of continuous change, which
prerequisites to think different and see every problem as an opportunity for something
creative.
In the Appendix C of this report, we demonstrate a one-page structured illustration of the
most important points of our book review, done in Part A. We hope that this effort will
help the reader to get in a glance all that essential meanings analyzed by Michael Raynor in
