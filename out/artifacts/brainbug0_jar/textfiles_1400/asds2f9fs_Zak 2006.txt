<-----Page 1----->1. Introduction

You must trust and believe in people or life becomes impossible.
Anton Chekhov
The traditional view in economics is that individuals respond to incentives, but
absent strong incentives to the contrary selfishness prevails. Moreover, this “greed is good”
approach is deemed “rational” behavior; without extreme self-interest, the standard models
predict that money will be left on the table during a transaction and therefore an
equilibrium cannot have been reached.

For example, standard principal-agent models

predict that absent monitoring, employees will shirk to the extent possible since working is
presumed to produce a negative utility flow. Nevertheless, in countless firms on every day
of the week, employees labor away without overt monitoring; for example, those who
telecommute. This is not to say that some shirking does not occur, but that human beings
behave a bit differently than in models of “rational economic agents” for reasons that are
not well-understood (though many possible explanations have been advanced, see
Camerer, 2003).
Similarly, a substantial body of research has examined variations in efficiency by
individuals within a firm, called X-inefficiency (XE) by Leibenstein (1966) (reviewed in
Franz, 1997; and Franz, this book). The consensus view is that XE arises from bounded
rationality and psychological motives that militate against efficiency. One way to reduce XE is
to provide incentives for individuals to behave “more rationally.” Unfortunately, how this is
done (and what it even means) is difficult to identify.

Nevertheless, many estimates of the

degree of XE are moderate (Franz, this book), suggesting that employees, most of the time,
are reasonably efficient.
A third example of a failure of the fully rational agent model is the degree of
cheating during intertemporal transactions with asymmetric information (Zak & Knack,
2001). Choosing a money manager or investment advisor to invest on one’s behalf typically
results in an informational asymmetry regarding subsequent returns. The investor can
estimate returns imperfectly because the type and timing of each transaction may difficult to
establish, while the advisor knows the actual return but may not to report it’s true value to
the investor. While this problem exists, casual observation suggests that, for a given
institutional setting, “most” investors do not appear to be cheated, at least not grossly,
although spectacular exceptions have been widely reported. Indeed, Zak & Knack (2001)
1

<-----Page 2----->demonstrate that low rates of investment occur primarily because of weak formal and
informal institutions that inadequately enforce contracts. Nevertheless, even in institutional
environments that do not enforce contracts well, a substantial number of investments still
occur, presumably without undo duress, suggesting that some or even many money
managers are reasonably trustworthy (or, alternatively, that investors are poor monitors of
advisors, but since investors have a substantial incentive to monitor, this explanation is
unlikely).
A possible explanation for the substantial amount of “irrational” behavior observed
in markets (and elsewhere) is that humans are a highly social species and to an extent value
what other humans think of them.

This behavior can be termed trustworthiness—

cooperating when someone places trust in us. Indeed, we inculcate children nearly from
birth to share and care about others. In economic nomenclature, reciprocating what others
expect us to do may provide a utility flow itself (Frey, Matthias & Stutzer, 2004). Loosely, it
is possible that it “feels good” to fulfill others’ expectations in us. If such a cooperative
instinct exists, it must be conditioned on the particular environment of exchange, including
the history of interactions (if any) with a potential exchange partner.

If conditional

cooperation were not the case, individuals would be gullible, and the genes that code for
gullibility would not have survived over evolutionary time (Boyd et al. 2003).
Instead, conditional on the parties involved in trade, budget and time constraints,
and the social, economic, and legal institutions in place, individuals may exhibit high
degrees of cooperation or nearly complete selfishness. This leads one to ask which
institutional arrangements promote or inhibit trustworthiness. A second question is, for a
fixed institutional environment, what are the mechanisms that allow us to decide who to
trust, and when to be trustworthy? Relatedly, for a given institutional setting, why is there
variation among individuals if the incentives to trust or be trustworthy are identical?
This chapter sketches a neuroeconomic model of trust and provides several forms
of evidence in support of this model.

Neuroeconomics (Zak, 2004) is an emerging

transdisciplinary field that utilizes the measurement techniques of neuroscience to
understand how people make economic decisions. This approach is of particular interest
in studying trust because subjects in a laboratory who can choose to trust others and be
trustworthy are unable to articulate why they make their decisions.

Taking

2

<-----Page 3----->neurophysiological measurements during trust experiments permits researchers to directly
identify how subjects make decisions even when the subjects themselves are unaware of
how they do this.

Readers are referred to Zak (2004) for a full description of

neuroscientific techniques used to measure brain activity. These tools open the black box
inside the skull and provide radical new insights in economics. Trust is among the most
interesting of the topics being studied.
2. Institutions, Public Policy, and Generalized Trust
Generalized trust is defined as the probability that two randomly chosen people will
trust each other in a one-time interaction. Evidence for generalized trust across different
institutional settings can be obtained from the World Values Survey (and its imitators).
Figure 1 plots the proportion of those who answered yes to the question “Generally
speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in
dealing with people?”

The data show an order-of-magnitude variation, with 3% of

Brazilians and 5% of Peruvians responding affirmatively, while 66% and 60% of
Norwegians and Swedes, respectively, asserting that others can be trusted.
There is a simple explanation for trustworthiness during repeated bilateral
interactions. The Folk Theorem states that cooperative behaviors can be sustained when
there are mutual gains from cooperation as long as repeat interactions occur for an
indefinite future. This explanation is problematic when analyzing generalized trust because
many transactions occur only once, or repeat for only a finite number of times. Why in
these settings do people still trust one another?
When I began to investigate how individuals decide when to trust and be
trustworthy in 1998, I was surprised to find there was very little written about trust by
economists. Psychologists have studied trust, but this literature focused more on individual
attributes rather than on the setting of particular interactions. The magnitude of the
variation in the data in Figure 1 strongly suggested to me that trust varied not because
Brazilians were different from Norwegians, but because the setting in which interactions
took place was different. Because I have a background in biology, I searched this literature
and discovered a rich set of findings I could draw upon to build a biologically-consistent, or
bioeconomic (Zak & Denzau, 2001) model of trust.

3

<-----Page 4----->The resulting paper, Zak & Knack (2001), built a dynamic general equilibrium
model based on Hamilton’s Rule from evolutionary biology that identifies how much one
is expected to care about another’s welfare as a function of the proportion of shared genes.
It extends Hamilton’s Rule to account for how variations in exchange environments affect
the likelihood that one’s transaction partner will be trustworthy when information is
asymmetrically distributed and contracts are costly to enforce. The model shows that the
degree of generalized trust in a country is inversely related to the transactions costs
associated with enforcing an investment contract. In particular, trust depends on the social

environment (how similar or dissimilar are those in a transaction; for example, think of the
high degree of ethnic homogeneity in Norway, and how strongly social norms are
enforced); the legal environment (how effectively contracts are enforced by formal
institutions; for example, how readily redress can be obtained if one party of to the
transaction believes that he or she obtained an unfair outcome); and the economic

environment (as incomes rise, people will behave as if they trust others more because their
time cost to investigate their trading partner rises; as income inequality rises, it is more
likely that one’s trading partner will be untrustworthy because differences between parties
to exchange, and therefore incentives to cheat, are greater).
The extensive empirical tests done by Zak & Knack (2001) show that the exchangeenvironment variables identified in the theoretical model explain 76% of the variation in
the cross-country trust data plotted in Figure 1. It also shows that societies that are less
heterogeneous (in income, language, ethnicity, etc.) have higher trust because social ties
between parties who are similar informally enforce contracts. For similar reasons, societies
that are fair (have less economic discrimination) have higher trust.

Alternatively,

sufficiently strong formal institutions that enforce contracts can promote high levels of trust
even in highly heterogeneous societies like the U.S. Lastly, the economic positions of
trading partners affect the degree to which they will trust others and be trustworthy.
The Zak & Knack model shows that trust is directly related to economic growth by
reducing transaction costs and facilitating investment. Empirically, trust is among the
powerful factors economists have discovered that promote growth. The analysis in Zak &
Knack (2001) shows that a 15 percentage point increase in the proportion of people in a
country who think others are trustworthy raises income per person by 1% per year for

4

<-----Page 5----->every year thereafter. For example, if trust in the U.S. increased from its current level of
36% to 51%, average income would rise by about $400 per year thereafter due to the
additional business investment and job creation. The impact of trust on living standards is
quantitatively large; $400 per year corresponds to an additional $30,000 in average lifetime
income.
Zak & Knack (2001) also show that if trust is sufficiently low (below 30% for the
average country in Figure 1), then the investment rate will be so low that living standards
will stagnate or even decline. This “poverty trap” is primarily due to ineffective formal
institutions that result in low levels of generalized trust.

The model shows that the

threshold level of trust necessary for positive economic growth is increasing in per capita
income. As a result, it appears to be difficult to escape from a low-trust poverty trap
without outside intervention.
In a sequel paper, Knack & Zak (2003) asked if there were cost-effective policies
that governments could implement to raise trust levels. Cost-effective policies were defined
as those that produce a greater increase in income by raising trust (which raises investment)
than they cost to implement. Knack & Zak found that many policies are able to raise trust,
and some do so by affecting multiple aspects of the environment of exchange identified in
Zak & Knack (2001). For example,
•

education has three effects: increasing the quality of formal institutions that enforce
contracts, decreasing income inequality, and directly raising trust by raising
incomes;

•

Press freedoms and civil liberties increase the quality of civil institutions and
thereby trust;

•

Telephones and roads directly raise trust by increasing social ties between
interacting parties; and

•

Income transfers reduce inequality and thereby raise trust.

The analysis in Knack & Zak (2003) shows that levels of generalized trust can be affected
by public policy. Unfortunately, few of the policies examined were cost-effective. Note
that the determination of cost-effectiveness included only the effect of the policy on trust
itself and in this way on incomes. These calculations therefore underestimated the true

5

<-----Page 6----->benefits of each policy. For example, a new road may raise trust by increasing social
interactions, but it also has a direct effect on growth by reducing the cost of getting goods to
market; the latter is ignored in the foregoing analysis to focus solely on trust-based growth
policies. This narrow view of cost-effectiveness was chosen to see if trust-based
development policies existed
Two policies unambiguously increase incomes by raising trust more than they cost to
implement: education and income transfers. The former occurs because of the three ways
that education raises trust, producing a nearly 500% average return on the cost of paying for
an additional year of education for the countries depicted in Figure 1. Surprisingly, income
transfers produce an approximately 50% return by raising trust, taking into account
administrative costs (it costs roughly one dollar to transfer one dollar). This does not
account for possible disincentive effects from transfers and likely is driven by the very low
trust among countries with very unequal income distributions. A third factor, freedom, was
found to have a powerful effect on trust by increasing the number of social interactions and
making institutions and individuals more accountable. Unfortunately, there is no agreed
upon way to determine the cost of freedom. As a result, the cost-effectiveness of policies
that, for example, increase press freedoms, are difficult to determine.
Because of my interest in the biological factors that drive trustworthy behavior, I
investigated whether biological factors directly impact generalized trust (Zak & Fakhar,
2005). Using a large set of data on biological environments across countries, using a theory
(described in Section 3 below) that neuroactive hormones “guide” humans as to when they
should be trustworthy, Fakhar and I found omnibus variables that were related to
generalized trust. We built these variables using factor analysis using the high degree of
correlation between related environmental measures. Two factors, ecological and phyto,
were statistically related to trust. Ecological measures pollution in the physical environment
of exchange. It is dominated by measures of “xenoestrogens” or synthetic estrogen-mimics
(such as the pesticide DDT), and is strongly negatively related to trust. Phyto is an index of
phytoestrogen consumption. Phytoestrogens are plant-based estrogens found in soybeans,
legumes, wine, tea and many other foods, and we find they are strongly positively related to
trust. This is consistent with findings from biology showing that estrogens affect social
behaviors. The correlations Fakhar and I found maintain statistical significance when

6

<-----Page 7----->income is controlled. Interestingly, these biological factors are orthogonal to the
institutional factors that Zak & Knack (2001) show affect trust.

Thus, the biological

environment represents a distinct pathway that affects the likelihood that others will be
trustworthy.
The results of Zak & Knack (2001), Knack & Zak (2003), and Zak & Fakhar (2005)
demonstrate that the likelihood of two individuals who do not know each other exhibiting
trust depends crucially on the social, legal, biological, and economic environments. This
extends the narrowly rational models in economics by showing that although people
respond to incentives, they do so without making consciously deliberated decisions. These
analyses do not provide evidence that individuals respond similarly to changes in
institutions.

Nor do they address the mechanisms through which one person decides to

trust another because of the level of aggregation. We turn to these issues next.
3. Experimental Findings
This section surveys a variety of experimental studies that support the thesis that
human beings are “wired” to be conditionally cooperative. President Abraham Lincoln
said “… people, when rightly and fully trusted, will return the trust,” A substantial number
of behavioral experiments by economists and psychologists have characterized the high
degree of trust and trustworthiness in the laboratory consistent with Lincoln’s view that
humans tend to reciprocate trust. A typical experimental task to investigate trust and
trustworthiness is the “trust game” (Berg, Dickhaut & McCabe, 1995).

All the

experimental evidence presented here uses variants of this game so its structure is
presented in detail. Subjects (typically students) are recruited for an experiment and all
those who show up at the laboratory receive $10 for agreeing to participate for an hour to
an hour and a half. It is important that subjects’ identities are masked so that neither other
participants nor the researchers can associate a particular person with his or her choices.
Otherwise, subjects may change their choices to “please” experimenters or avoid
confrontations with other participants. For example, Smith (1998) discusses the substantial
increase in cooperative behaviors in games run single vs. double blind show.
The game is fully described to participants prior to play, usually through a series of
examples.

There is strong ethic in experimental economics to avoid deception, and

7

<-----Page 8----->experiments using this game nearly always follow this norm. Subjects are then randomly
assigned to dyads. Within each dyad, subjects are randomly given the role of decisionmaker 1 (DM1) or decision-maker 2 (DM2). DM1 then is prompted (often via software,
but sometimes using written instructions) to send an integer amount (including zero) of his
or her $10 show-up earnings to the DM2 in his/her dyad. Both subjects are instructed that
whatever DM1 sends to DM2 is deducted from DM1’s account and tripled in DM2’s
account. For example, if DM1 sends $8, he or she keeps $2, and DM2 then has $34
(=$8×3 + $10 show up amount). DM2 is then told how much DM1 sent him/her and the
total in his/her account, and then is prompted to send some integer amount (including
zero) back to DM1.
Subjects are informed before the experiment begins that they will (typically) make a
single decision after which the interaction ends (a variant is having DM1 and DM2 make N
decisions with N different individuals). The single decision structure controls for the
possible effects of reputation that can sustain trust. Providing an endowment to both DM1
and DM2 reduces the incentive for subjects to make transfers to equalize earnings within a
dyad. Finally, the show up amount is typically emphasized as being paid to compensate
participants for spending an hour in the lab so they don’t view this as gambling with “house
money.”
The consensus in the literature is that the transfer from DM1 to DM2 is a (costly)
signal of trust. The mostly likely reason that DM1 would sacrifice some or all of his/her
show up earnings is to indicate to DM2 that the “pie just got larger based on my sacrifice.”
There is an expectation that DM2 understands this and will act accordingly by sharing the
larger pie. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that DM2 will return any money, and no
external enforcement mechanism. Thus, DM1’s choice reflects his or her view of the
human predilection for reciprocity. The return transfer from DM2 to DM1 is commonly
viewed as a measure of trustworthiness (or reciprocity). To be trustworthy in this game
entails a 1:1 dollar cost to DM2. Subjects know that the transfer from DM2 to DM1 is not
tripled, and each dollar sent comes out of DM2s account. It is the costliness of the choices
that make this an interesting way to quantify trust and trustworthiness. It also captures the
notion that individuals trust each other because there is potentially mutual benefit.

8

<-----Page 9----->The subgame perfect (SGP) Nash equilibrium for this game is found by iterating
backwards. If DM2 prefers more money than less, then he/she will keep everything DM1
sends. DM1, anticipating this, is predicted to send nothing to DM2. Although the SGP
Nash equilibrium predicts no trust and no trustworthiness, this is at odds with the data
from the large number of times this experiment has been run, including for stakes up to
$1,000 in the US and for three months average salary in developing countries (Smith, 1998;
Camerer, 2004). Typically, three-quarters of DM1s will send some money to DM2s, and
an even higher proportion of DM2s return some money to DM1s.

Indeed, in the

experiments run by my lab, which are typical of findings from other labs, DM1s who
exhibit trust leave with approximately $14, or 40% more than their $10 show up earnings.
DM2 average earnings are even more, about $17, because they are typically trusted by the
DM1 in their dyad but do not equally share the largess.
There is clearly a problem with the SGP Nash equilibrium in this game since those
who play out of equilibrium earn more money. Though John Nash did not directly
analyze the trust game (which is a sequential-play prisoner’s dilemma), his well-publicized
illness reveals why the SGP Nash equilibrium concept does not apply here. As most
people know, John Nash suffers from the neuropsychiatric disorder schizophrenia.
Schizophrenics are typically socially withdrawn, and analogously the SGP Nash equilibrium
for the trust game does not recognize that the game is embedded in a social interaction.
DM2s nearly always return some money to DM1s because of the social obligation incurred
by the sacrifice made by DM1 to signal trust. Put differently, DM1s appear to make
transfers using their understanding of the typical human behavior that follows when
someone does something “nice” for you; that is, you are obligated to return the favor. This
does not always happen, but it nearly always does: in my experiments, roughly 90% of
DM2s return at least some money to the DM1s they are paired with.
In contrast, “economic man” has no social conscience and therefore plays the SGP
Nash strategy. One such subject appeared in a recent experiment in my lab. Some of my
experiments (described in detail below) involve blood draws. Subjects in these experiments
know before they participate that the $10 show up earnings compensate them for spending
up to 1.5 hours in the lab and for the needle stick(s) and four tubes of blood we will take
from them. Once subjects have made their choices regarding the degree of trust or

9

<-----Page 10----->trustworthiness and we have obtained blood from all of them, the subjects leave the lab and
we centrifuge the tubes and extract out plasma and serum for analysis. Each experiment
session has 16 to 20 subjects, so when blood is obtained from the final subject, there is a
rush to begin processing up to 80 tubes of blood. There are some subjects from whom it is
difficult to obtain blood, for example, those with very small veins, and those with a layer of
fat covering the veins. The subject in question was a chubby male and the phlebotomist
had to stick him four times before a vein was found. Meanwhile, I and my graduate
students were hovering, ready to get to work. After we collected his blood, I apologized to
him for the multiple needle sticks and thanked him for participating. He said he was elated
to be in the experiment and asked if he could return for another session (no). “Elation” is
not what I had ever observed for subjects who suffer through four needle sticks. Out of
curiosity, I checked his behavioral data since I knew he was the last subject in that session.
This participant was a DM2 who had had maximal trust placed in him by the DM1 in his
dyad (the DM1 had sent his/her entire $10 show up earnings to him and kept nothing).
Nevertheless, this DM2 was completely untrustworthy, being unwilling to share any money
with the person who had trusted him. He left the lab with the maximal earnings of $40
(=$10*3 + $10). This was economic man, and he unabashedly played the SGP Nash
strategy. Of course he enjoyed this experiment!
Although this anecdote illustrates that untrustworthy economic men (and women,
see below) do exist, a mystery in the literature before I began running my experiments was
why there were so few untrustworthy subjects in the trust game (Smith, 1998). If this
mystery could be solved, it would likely identify the mechanism through which people
decide to be trusting and trustworthy. Then such a mechanism could be manipulated, for
example, by designing exchange environments that utilize it. This led me to think that
there might be a physiologic mechanism that motivates subjects to be trustworthy. Now I’ll
explain the blood draws.
As discussed above, experimental subjects are unable to describe why they make
trusting decisions, so if a physiologic process was driving trustworthiness, it would have to
work below the level of conscious thought—very much counter to the model of the
thoughtful economic agent. I was unable to find evidence of such a mechanism in the
experimental economics and psychology literatures, but there were some hints in the

10

<-----Page 11----->neuroscience literature studying rodents. Some rodent species are highly sociable, living in
groups, and often forming long-term pair bonds where both males and females care for
offspring. For example, the prairie vole, a rodent living in the Midwestern US, exhibits
these behaviors. Interestingly, a genetically and geographically closely related species, the
montane vole, shows none of these traits—males are solitary, promiscuous, and avoid their
offspring. These behaviors were first studied in the 1980s by several labs, and by the 1990s
the consensus in this literature was that these pro-social behaviors were the result of a
hormone called oxytocin (OT). OT has target receptors in both the peripheral organs and
in the brains of mammals. I wondered if the trusting behaviors in the lab were being
caused by OT. In other words, I hypothesized that strangers in the trust game may have
been forming temporary “attachments” to each other, much as OT causes attachment in
prairie voles. Unfortunately, the distribution of OT receptors is not well conserved across
species, so extrapolation from voles to human behavior was only speculative.

An

experiment was needed.
Prior to my experiments, the behavioral effects of OT had been little studied in
humans. This is primarily because OT is medically uninteresting unless a women is giving
birth or breastfeeding. Oxytocin means “fast birth” in Greek and this hormone contracts
the uterus during parturition; women often get synthetic OT (drug trade name: pitocin) to
speed up birth. It also promotes the release of breast milk. I set up an experiment to test
if OT rose when subjects received a signal of trust and motivated subjects reciprocate and
be trustworthy.
My collaborators and I used an anonymous one-shot trust game to see if even in the
starkest case of (mostly) depersonalized one-time exchange OT mediated trustworthiness.
Trust games played face-to-face show nearly 100% trustworthiness, removing the behavioral
variation, so we did not use this approach even though the rodent literature emphasized the
importance of visual and olfactory cues to promote oxytocin release. We randomized
subjects to play the standard one-shot trust game or a control game in which DM1 publicly
pulled a ping-pong ball numbered 0, 1, ..., 10 from an urn and this amount was taken from
his/her account and tripled in DM2’s account. This control game replicates the standard
game but removes the intentionality of DM1s choice to sacrifice money to send a signal of
trust. It accounts for the possibility that simply receiving money may raise DM2 OT.

11

<-----Page 12----->When discussing the findings below, I call the standard intentional choice experiments the
Intentional condition, and the random choice experiments the Random Draw condition.
Note that sample sizes are moderate as the direct cost of obtaining the data (blood draw
supplies, subject payments and hormone assays) are relatively expensive, around $300 per
subject (this does not include the cost of necessary specialized equipment such as a
refrigerated centrifuge, an ultracold freezer, etc.). The reader is referred to the published
work cited below for details on blood acquisition, handling, and assays.
As reported in Zak, Kurzban & Matzner (in press; and 2005) and as shown in Figure 2,
OT levels in DM2s who receive an intentional trust signal are almost double that in DM2s in
the Random Draw condition. This difference is highly statistically significant (F-test, one-tailed,
N=38, p=0.00001), and occurred even though the average amount of money transferred from
DM1s to DM2s is the same between conditions (F-test, two-tailed, p>0.87). Relatedly, there is
a high degree of reciprocity (trustworthiness) when DM2s receive intentional transfers from
DM1s. The correlation between the amount received by DM2s and amount they return to
DM1s in the Intention condition is .80 (different than zero, two-tailed t-test, p=0.00001, N=19).
This contrasts with the Random Draw condition, in which this correlation is 0.20 and is not
statistically different from zero (two-tailed t-test, p>0.40, N=19).
In addition, DM2 OT levels were strongly related to their behavior in the Intention
condition. Estimating a multiple regression model of relative trustworthiness (the amount
returned by DM2 to DM1/three times the transfer DM1 sent to DM2), both OT and OT2
are highly statistically significant (t-test, p<.03, R2=0.39). Using relative trustworthiness as
the dependent variable controls for the amount the DM2 received from DM1. The
inclusion of OT2 accounts for physiologic saturation. The significance of OT and OT2 hold
whether or not control variables such as age are included (estimated parameters of all
controls variables are statistically indistinguishable from zero). There was no overall
difference in the trustworthiness of males and females, as some behavioral experiments
have found (Croson & Buchan, 1999).
Because OT is known to interact with many other hormones as the body seeks
homeostasis, we also measured nine other hormones to determine if the behavioral effects
we found were directly caused by OT or by some other hormone affecting OT, or by OT
affecting another hormone. For example, OT suppresses the release of one of the primary

12

<-----Page 13----->human stress hormones, cortisol, so DM2s might have been more trustworthy because they
were less stressed physiologically. None of the other hormones were related to OT levels
or DM2 behavior, with one exception. Randomly, some women in our experiment were
ovulating (progesterone > 3ng/ml) but none were pregnant (which is another time
progesterone is high) by testing their levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).
Progesterone has been shown to inhibit the uptake of OT by its receptor. This natural
experiment where some female participants were ovulating allowed progesterone to disrupt
the effect of OT on DM2 behavior: these women got the same OT surge when receiving a
signal of trust but were less trustworthy (one-tailed t-test, p<.04). This is solid evidence for
the direct and causal effect of OT on trustworthy behavior.
OT is a highly reactive hormone; without a stimulus it is present only in minute
amounts. It is released in pulses when needed and has a very short half-life (3-5 minutes).
Not surprisingly, we did not find any relationship between basal OT levels of DM1s and
the signal of trust they sent. These are “basal” levels because DM1s did not receive a social
stimulus as did DM2s. Contrarily, DM2 OT is “activated” by the social signal. The lack of
a relationship between OT and DM1 behavior is also consistent with an evolutionary
account of OT. Suppose high OT individuals were more likely to give away resources to
strangers. Over evolutionary time these individuals would be targets for predation and the
genes responsible for this behavior would mostly disappear. Contrast this with DM2s.
They are conditionally trustworthy—OT rises after they receive a signal of trust (and rises
roughly in proportional to the signal). OT appears to motivate DM2s to behave in a prosocial manner rather than play the SGP Nash strategy. It is also worth noting that OT
receptors in the brain are in evolutionarily old regions, well below the cerebral cortex. This
provides a reason why subjects are unable to tell us why they are trustworthy—they simply
have a sense that this is the thing to do.
We also gave our experimental subjects an extensive survey inquiring about
demographics, social behaviors, sexual behaviors (since OT is a reproductive hormone),
and psychological profiles.

Of 200 questions, almost none were related to OT levels or

behavior in the trust game. Trust was related to three questions on whether DM1s thought
others were mostly trustworthy or honest, but none of the survey questions were related to
DM2 behavior.

13

<-----Page 14----->Scottish novelist and poet George MacDonald (1824-1905) appeared to understand
the physiologic value of being trusted when he wrote “Few delights can equal the presence
of one whom we trust utterly.” The evidence presented above supports my hypothesis that
signals of trust cause OT to be released. OT appears to induce a temporary attachment by
DM2 to the DM1 who has trusted him or her, much as OT induces mothers to attach to
infants and vice-versa. This temporary attachment might be called empathy. It literally
feels good when someone trusts you, and that good feeling causes most of us to be
trustworthy.
3.1 Where is economic man?
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) wrote that “People who have given us their
complete confidence believe that they have a right to ours. The inference is false, a gift
confers no rights.” Nietzsche has provided the perfect rationale to be an economic man or
woman. My lab has run approximately 200 subjects through the trust and blood draw
experiment, and this large sample has allowed us to provide some insights into which
subjects behave like economic men or women, i.e. those DM2s who take all or nearly all of
what they are sent. Figure 3 shows the data on DM2 OT and trustworthiness, with 5
outlier economic men/women circled.

The identified DM2s received trust signals, had

correspondingly high levels of OT, but somehow suppressed the urge to be trustworthy.
Why did they do this?
I recently reported (Zak, in press) that these subjects (3 male and 2 female) appear
to have personality traits that are quite different than the average subject in the experiment.
I examined if on any of the survey questions, these subjects were more than one standard
deviation from the mean of the entire sample (i.e. including them). I found that they were
exceptionally emotionally labile, experiencing large mood swings, and were usually sexually
active. They said that they believed others were trustworthy and evaluated themselves as
very trustworthy—perhaps a bit of self-deception as the survey was completed before the
choice in the experiment. They also were more likely to agree that accumulating wealth
while others lived in poverty was acceptable.
These results come from a small sample and should be taken with some
skepticism, but they are suggestive that personality traits may influence who plays the SGP

14

<-----Page 15----->Nash strategy. Contrarily, in the typical DM2s who are trustworthy, most of the variation in
the behavioral data are explained by OT levels. Much of my current work seeks to
characterize how the influences of nature and nurture interact to produce trustworthy or
untrustworthy individuals.
3.2 Trust in the brain
There may be more than one system in the brain that permits us to trust others and
be trustworthy. Oliver Williamson (1993) coined the term “calculative trust” to denote the
ability to use one’s experience to estimate the likelihood someone will be trustworthy. If
there is a calculative trust substrate in the brain, it is likely distinct from the OT system
(though perhaps informed by it) as OT receptors are densest in regions of the brain
associated with emotional responses and autonomic regulation.
In an early and important contribution to neuroeconomics, McCabe et al (2001)
had subjects play a binary-choice version of the trust game inside a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scanner.

McCabe and colleagues measured blood flow changes in the

brain, an indirect measure of neural activity, when subjects interacted with another human
or with a computer that moved with stated probabilities (see Zak, 2004 for a fuller
description of this measurement technique, known as functional MRI). These researchers
focused on an area in the medial prefrontal cortex (BA10) shown in previous studies to be
associated with “theory of mind.” Theory of mind is the ability that most humans older
than four years old have that allows them to anticipate what others will do by putting
themselves in someone else’s situation. Small children as well as most autistics are unable
to do this and have associated deficits in social interactions. In the trust game, using theory
of mind, a DM1 could probabilistically forecast what a DM2 would do.
Comparing regional neural activity for DM1s and DM2s who choose to trust/be
trustworthy to analogous choices when subjects were told they were playing against a
computer, McCabe and colleagues found greater neural activity in BA10. They also found
greater neural activity in BA10 when a subject played against another human and
cooperated vs. did not cooperate. The interpretation of these findings is that greater
prefrontal activity is needed to forecast what another person will do and trust them
compared to taking the sure payoff when playing the SGP Nash strategy or when

15

<-----Page 16----->interacting with a computer that plays using known probabilities. This theory of mind
activation is a neural substrate associated with calculative trust.
A similar study was published in 2002 by Rilling et al.

Rilling’s group studied

neural activity using functional MRI in 36 women playing a binary-choice sequential
prisoner’s dilemma game (i.e. the trust game). Contrasting play against a human to play
with a computer, they found greater neural activation in dopamine-innervated midbrain
regions, frontal regions associated with attention and error monitoring, as well as frontal
regions that process emotions. Midbrain regions rich in dopamine receptors are the
primary areas active during rewarding behaviors. These authors conclude that among the
women studied, cooperation itself is rewarding, but requires the mediation of the
conflicting concerns of making more money but behaving in socially less acceptable ways.
The findings of Rilling and colleagues are consistent with a central nervous system
role for OT during decisions to be trustworthy. OT facilitates the release of dopamine
during maternal to infant bonding—such attachment must be rewarding if mothers are to
care for infants, and for infants to seek maternal care. Similarly, a spike in OT and
subsequent dopamine release occur during sexual intimacy in order to motivate
reproduction and pair-bonding. It is literally (internally) rewarding to be trustworthy.
The effect of exogenous OT infusion on human trusting behaviors was recently
studied by myself and a team at the University of Zurich (Kosfeld et al., 2005). We ran a
trust game in which DM1s could transfer 0, 4, 8 or 12 monetary units; each monetary unit
was worth .40 Swiss Francs. 128 men received either 24IU of intranasal oxytocin, or
placebo in a double-blind design. After waiting 50 minutes for the drug to load, subjects
played four rounds of the trust game, being rematched with a different player in each
round. We found that DM1s who received exogenous OT were significantly more trusting
than those on placebo. For example, in the placebo group, 21% chose to trust maximally
(transferring 12 MUs), while 45% in the OT group exhibited maximal trust. On average,
DM1 trust was 17% higher in the OT group than the placebo group, a statistically
significant difference (one-sided Mann-Whitney test p<.03).
This exogenous manipulation demonstrates causally that OT can induce DM1s to
be more trusting. This appears to occur by reducing the anxiety associated with placing
trust in a stranger. Consistent with the findings of Zak et al (in press; and 2005), exogenous

16

<-----Page 17----->OT infusion had no effect on DM2 trustworthiness. Why? The majority of DM2s
received a signal of trust and had endogenous OT release. OT receptors were therefore
mostly bound up with OT, and additional exogenous OT would therefore have no
physiologic effect.
4. Implications and Conclusions
In my cross-country work, the most highly correlated variable associated with
generalized trust is self-reported happiness (see Figure 4; correlation different than zero at
p < .01, two-tailed t-test). Why are happy people trusting (or vice-versa)? The evidence
presented in this chapter strongly suggests that nature has designed us to be conditional
cooperators because it literally feels good. This positive feedback is how OT facilitates
bonding of mother to child, spouses to each other, and my experiments have shown,
causes strangers who are shown tangible evidence of trust placed in them to temporarily
attach to each other. The SGP Nash equilibrium in the trust game does not obtain because
the equilibrium’s assumptions are inconsistent with human nature.
The understanding of the mechanisms producing cooperative behaviors among
humans that my lab and other labs are developing has manifold applications in economics
and indeed to many human endeavors. Most importantly, in reducing poverty (Zak &
Knack, 2001). Trust and trustworthiness are also a solution to the low level of shirking in
principal-agent relationships, and the mostly fair dealing observable in transactions with
asymmetric information. More generally, trust arises in the quotidian human interactions of
all types that standard models of self-interest in economics and biology cannot explain,
such as tipping the waitress in a city you will not visit again.
So why do we trust? Modern life is nearly impossible without it, and certainly in
modern economies with largely impersonal exchange conditional trust is necessary for
transactions to occur. Understanding the neuroeconomics of trust can aid in the design of
institutions to promote interpersonal trust.

This includes using face-to-face negotiations

during transactions whenever possible, organizational designs that promote activities that
permit employees to form bonds such as outdoor adventures, and a recognition that
children and family are important. An effective way to raise trust, which is used by many
organizations including agencies of the U.S. government, is on-site massage therapy. It is

17

<-----Page 18----->not only the psychological effect of the employer “caring” about employees, but that this
caring manifests in human touch that raises oxytocin and productivity. Further applications
can be found in Zak (2003).
At the national level, trust can be raised by emphasizing the importance of
education, reducing inequalities, and promoting freedom and democracy.

National

institutions that allow and encourage individuals to achieve their goals directly promote
trust and therefore the creation of wealth. This is reflected in the higher rates of return on
national stock markets for countries that have higher levels of generalized trust (Zak, 2003).
English philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) wrote that “The most valuable
things in life are not measured in monetary terms. The really important things are not
houses and lands, stocks and bonds, automobiles and real state, but friendships, trust,
confidence, empathy, mercy, love and faith.”

The research reviewed here extends

Russell’s statement. Friendships, confidence, empathy, mercy, love and faith all follow
from trust and are likely mediated by oxytocin. As social scientists apply these findings to
institutional design, not only will productivity be raised, but so will happiness.
