Summary
Investors systematically deviate from rationality when
making financial decisions, yet the mechanisms responsible for these deviations have not been identified. Using event-related fMRI, we examined whether
anticipatory neural activity would predict optimal and
suboptimal choices in a financial decision-making
task. We characterized two types of deviations from
the optimal investment strategy of a rational risk-neutral agent as risk-seeking mistakes and risk-aversion
mistakes. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded
risky choices as well as risk-seeking mistakes, while
anterior insula activation preceded riskless choices
as well as risk-aversion mistakes. These findings
suggest that distinct neural circuits linked to anticipatory affect promote different types of financial choices
and indicate that excessive activation of these circuits may lead to investing mistakes. Thus, consideration of anticipatory neural mechanisms may add predictive power to the rational actor model of economic
decision making.
Introduction
Individual investors systematically deviate from optimal
behavior, which could influence asset valuation (Daniel
et al., 2002; Hirshleifer, 2001; Odean, 1998). The causes
of these deviations have not been established, but
emotion may have some influence. While some research has examined the role of emotion in decision
making (Camerer et al., 2005; Loewenstein et al., 2001)
and economists have begun to incorporate emotion
into models of individual choice (Bernheim and Rangel,
2004; Caplin and Leahy, 2001), scientists still lack a
mechanistic account of how emotion might influence
choice. Understanding such mechanisms might help
theorists to specify more accurate models of individual
decision making, which could ultimately improve the
design of economic institutions so as to facilitate optimal investor behavior.
Here, we sought to examine whether neural activation linked to anticipatory affect would predict financial
choices. At least two hypotheses have been put forth
regarding the role of affect in decision making. Accord*Correspondence: camelia@stanford.edu (C.M.K.); knutson@psych.

ing to one account, undifferentiated arousal might be
related to both risk seeking and risk aversion (Lo and
Repin, 2002). However, according to a second account,
positive aroused feelings associated with anticipation
of gain (e.g., “excitement”) may promote risk taking,
whereas negative aroused feelings associated with anticipation of loss (e.g., “anxiety”) may promote risk
aversion (Knutson et al., 2005; Paulus et al., 2003).
Recent evidence from human brain imaging implies
that affect evoked by the anticipation of gain and loss
may carry distinct neural signatures. Specifically, the
nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the ventral striatum
shows proportional activation during anticipation of
monetary gains (Breiter et al., 2001; Knutson et al., 2001),
and this activation correlates with positive aroused affect
(Bjork et al., 2004; Knutson et al., 2005; Martinez et al.,
2003). Neural markers of anticipatory negative affect
have not been as clearly delineated, but the anterior
insula provides a candidate substrate for a number of
reasons. First, brain imaging studies have consistently
reported activation of the anterior insula during anticipation of physical pain, which correlates with selfreported state anxiety (Buchel and Dolan, 2000; Chua
et al., 1999; Ploghaus et al., 1999). Second, the anterior
insula shows activation during anticipation of aversive
visual stimuli (Simmons et al., 2004). Third, the anterior
insula shows activation during risky choice in games
involving nonmonetary incentives, which correlates
with subsequent risk-aversion and trait measures of
negative aroused affect (Paulus et al., 2003). Although
the anterior insula is also sensitive to attentional and
other demands (Phan et al., 2002), a recent review suggests that activation in this region is more common under negative than positive affective circumstances (Wager et al., 2003).
The goals of this experiment were, first, to determine
whether anticipatory activity in the NAcc and anterior
insula would differentially predict risk-seeking versus
risk-averse choices and, second, to examine whether
activation in these regions would precede both suboptimal and optimal choices. Two studies have correlated
anticipatory neural activation with choice, but both involved choices that occurred in the context of social
interactions (which might prove more susceptible to affective biases) rather than financial decisions (Fehr et
al., 2004; Sanfey et al., 2003). Another study demonstrated a correlation between neural activation and immediate versus delayed reward choices, but did not investigate risky choices (McClure et al., 2004).
To investigate the influence of anticipatory neural activation on financial risk taking, we combined a dynamic investment task with event-related fMRI. We
compared subjects’ actual investment choices during
the task to those of a rational risk-neutral agent who
maximizes expected utility. Suboptimal choices were
defined as deviations from this model and included
both “risk-seeking mistakes” (in which people take
risks when they should not) and “risk-aversion mistakes” (in which people do not take risks when they
should).

Figure 1. Trial Structure
2 s per panel.

We designed a task to elicit a range of investment
behaviors, including risk-seeking and risk-averse financial choices. The Behavioral Investment Allocation
Strategy (BIAS) task consisted of 20 blocks of 10 trials
each (see Figure 1). During each trial, subjects first saw
two stocks and a bond (Anticipation) and then chose
one when the word “Choose” appeared above the assets (Choice). Then subjects waited for a brief period
(Wait), after which their earnings for that trial and total
earnings were displayed (Outcome). These were followed by a display of the outcomes of all assets on that
trial (Market) and a fixation cross (Fixation; see Figure 1).
At the beginning of each block (indicated by a cue),
one of the two stocks was randomly assigned to be the
“good” stock, while the other was assigned to be the
“bad” stock, without the subject’s knowledge. The
good stock dominated the bad stock in the sense of
first-order stochastic dominance (Huang and Litzenberger, 1988). Specifically, outcomes of the good stock
(i.e., +$10 with 50% probability, +$0 with 25% probability, and −$10 with 25% probability) were better than
outcomes of the bad stock (i.e., +$10 with 25% probability, +$0 with 25% probability, and −$10 with 50%
probability) on average for each trial. The bond paid $1
with 100% probability on each trial. Earnings were
drawn independently from these distributions for each
trial, and subjects were informed about the distributions before performing the task.
Based on prior research, we first predicted that gain
versus loss outcomes would activate the NAcc and mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) (Knutson et al., 2003) and
that loss versus gain outcomes would instead activate
the anterior insula (Paulus et al., 2003). We then examined whether NAcc activation preceded both optimal
and suboptimal stock (i.e., risky) choices, as well as
whether anterior insula activation instead preceded
both optimal and suboptimal bond (i.e., riskless) choices.
Results
Analyses of brain imaging data focused on changes in
activation during outcome, market, and anticipation
periods prior to a given choice. Analyses proceeded
through two stages. In the first “localization” stage, we
constructed group statistical maps to identify foci of

interest and then verified the predicted patterns of activation with multivariate regressions. In the second “prediction” stage, we used activation extracted from these
foci during the anticipation period to predict both optimal and suboptimal subsequent investment choices
with logit regression models.
In localization analyses of the outcome period, stock
gain versus loss outcomes were associated with NAcc
and MPFC activation at both the small volume-corrected and global thresholds, as predicted (Knutson et
al., 2003) (see Table 1 and Figure 2). Although the anterior insula did not show significant deactivation at the
global threshold, bilateral foci did show the only deactivations in the brain for this contrast that passed the
small volume-corrected threshold (TC = −39, 19, 7; Z =
−2.99; TC = 38, 19, 11; Z = −2.99). Other regions that
passed the global threshold included right orbitofrontal
cortex, left anterior cingulate, left precuneus, and left
posterior cingulate, replicating prior findings (Knutson
et al., 2003). Multiple regression of VOI data (hemodynamic lag = 4 s) verified that, after prior stock choice,
gain outcomes were associated with increased NAcc
and MPFC activation (all p values < 0.05; see Table S1
in the Supplemental Data available online).
In analyses of the market period, relative gain outcomes (i.e., larger difference between the outcome of
the chosen versus unchosen stock) were also associated with MPFC activation at the small volume-corrected and global thresholds, as predicted (see Table 2
and Figure 2). Other areas that passed the global
threshold included left middle frontal gyrus, bilateral
caudate, left putamen, and dorsomedial thalamus. Mul-

Figure 2. Effect of Actual and Relative Outcomes on Neural Activation
The top panels depict the contrast of large
gains versus large losses during the Outcome period following stock choice. The
bottom panels depict the contrast of chosen
versus unchosen outcomes during the Market period following stock choice. n = 19.

tivariate regression of VOI data verified that, after a
stock choice, relative gain outcomes increased NAcc
and MPFC activation. Conversely, relative loss outcomes increased anterior insula activation (see Table
S2). After a bond choice, relative gain outcomes (i.e.,
either of the stocks performed worse than the bond)
increased MPFC activation (see Table S3).
While not the focus of this study, uncertainty correlated maximally and negatively with bilateral anterior
cingulate foci, easily exceeding the global threshold
(TC = +4 16, 45; Z = −5.37; TC = −4, 16, 45; Z = −6.99).
Further analysis of anticipatory activation extracted
from these foci revealed that activation was not greatest with maximal uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty = 0.5,
corresponding to minimal information about which
stock to choose), but rather with maximal conflict (i.e.,
uncertainty = 0.3, corresponding to minimal information
about whether to choose the stock or the bond). Specifically, activation in this region was −0.08 ± 0.01 (mean ±
SEM, n = 2100) when uncertainty was less than 0.25;
−0.05 ± 0.01 (n = 868) when uncertainty was between
0.25 and 0.35; and −0.15 ± 0.02 (n = 832) when uncertainty was greater than 0.35. Additionally, anterior cingulate anticipatory activation robustly predicted subjects’ subsequent reaction time [t(3718) = 7.92, R2 =
0.15 in a linear regression model that included subject
fixed effects]. Thus, anticipatory anterior cingulate activation correlated most robustly not with uncertainty,
which was greatest when it was unclear which stock to
choose, but rather with conflict, which was greatest
when it was unclear whether to choose a stock or the
bond. However, anticipatory anterior cingulate activa-

tion did not correlate with subsequent choice, as described below.
In prediction analyses, we included anticipatory
NAcc, MPFC, and anterior insula activation (lag = 4 s) in
logistic regression models of subsequent choice, after
incorporating relevant behavioral variables (see Tables
3–5). Adding activation from control regions (i.e., bilateral anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, medial caudate, and amygdala) did not increase explanatory
power, and so, data from these regions were not included in subsequent prediction analyses.
Logistic regressions indicated that anticipatory NAcc
and anterior insula activation were correlated with subsequent choice and that these associations critically
depended upon prior choice. For all choices, anticipatory NAcc activation increased the likelihood of choosing a stock only when the prior choice was a bond (a
0.1% increase in NAcc activation led to a 0.06% increase in the odds of choosing a stock; p < 0.05). When
the prior choice was a stock, anticipatory anterior insula activation increased the likelihood of choosing the
bond (a 0.1% increase in anterior insula activation led
to a 0.08% increase in the odds of choosing a bond;
p < 0.05; see Table 3 and Figure 3). MPFC activation
did not correlate with subsequent choice. Thus, high
NAcc activation preceded switching to risk-seeking
choices, while high anterior insula activation preceded
switching to risk-averse choices.
Logistic regressions also indicated that anticipatory
NAcc and anterior insula activation were correlated
with the types of mistakes that subjects made. When
the prior choice was riskless (i.e., the bond), anticipatory NAcc activation increased the likelihood of making
a risk-seeking mistake (a 0.1% increase in NAcc activation led to a 0.07% increase in the odds of making a
risk-seeking mistake; p < 0.05). Also, anticipatory NAcc
activation decreased the likelihood of making a riskaversion mistake (a 0.1% increase in NAcc activation
led to a 0.06% decrease in the odds of making a riskaversion mistake; p < 0.05). When the prior choice was
risky (i.e., a stock), anterior insula activation increased
the likelihood of making a risk-aversion mistake (a 0.1%
increase in insula activation led to a 0.11% increase in
odds of making a risk-aversion mistake; p < 0.05; see

correlated with subsequent mistakes. Thus, anticipatory neural activation correlated with both optimal and
suboptimal subsequent choices, even after controlling
for behavioral variables that should have been the primary determinants of those choices.
Finally, we investigated whether individual differences in average anticipatory activation correlated with
subsequent choice, after establishing that average anticipatory activation varied across individuals. Because
regression of anticipatory NAcc activation on subject
fixed effects yielded no significant differences, relationships between individual differences in anticipatory
NAcc activation and choice were not examined further.
On the other hand, regression of anticipatory anterior
insula activation on subject fixed effects did yield significant differences in 8 (all p values < 0.05) of 19 subjects, suggesting some individual differences in anticipatory insula activation. Individual differences in average
anterior insula activation during anticipation were significantly correlated with the frequency of choosing a
bond after having chosen a stock [t(17) = 2.14, p < 0.05;
R2 = 0.21]. Additionally, individual differences in average
anterior insula activation during anticipation were also

significantly correlated with the frequency of risk-aversion mistakes after having chosen a stock [t(17) = 2.10,
p < 0.05, R2 = 0.21]. Thus, individual differences in anticipatory anterior insula activation were related to
making subsequent riskless choices and risk-aversion
mistakes.
Discussion
While NAcc activation preceded both risky choices and
risk-seeking mistakes, anterior insula activation preceded both riskless choices and risk-aversion mistakes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that NAcc represents gain prediction (Knutson et al.,
2001), while anterior insula represents loss prediction
(Paulus et al., 2003). One of the contributions of this
paper is the BIAS task, as it provides a way to operationalize optimal choices, which by extension allows
the identification of suboptimal choices. According to
financial models, one can define risk-neutral choices
based on Bayesian updating as rational and deviations
from these choices as irrational. The results therefore

The left panel indicates a significant effect of anterior insula activation on the odds of making riskless (bond) choices and risk-aversion mistakes (RAM) after a stock choice (Stockt-1). The right panel
indicates a significant effect of NAcc activation on the odds of
making risk-aversion mistakes, risky choices, and risk-seeking mistakes (RSM) after a bond choice (Bondt-1). The odds ratio for a
given choice is defined as the ratio of the probability of making that
choice divided by the probability of not making that choice. Percent change in odds ratio results from a 0.1% increase in NAcc or
anterior insula activation. Error bars indicate the standard errors of
the estimated effect. *coefficient significant at p < 0.05.

indicate that, above and beyond contributing to rational
choice, anticipatory neural activation may also promote
irrational choice. Thus, financial decision making may
require a delicate balance—recruitment of distinct circuits may be necessary for taking or avoiding risks, but
excessive activation of one mechanism or the other
may lead to mistakes.
While the observation that NAcc activation is correlated with subsequent risk taking and risk-seeking mistakes agrees with a gain prediction account of NAcc
function (Knutson et al., 2001), the current findings are
not as consistent with alternative accounts. Motor
preparation accounts predict equal activation prior to
motor acts of equal force (Mogenson et al., 1980) and
so cannot explain the NAcc’s prediction of risk-seeking
but not risk-averse choices, since both required active
choices indicated by button presses. Similarly, a saliency account predicts equal activation during anticipation of both large gains and losses (Zink et al., 2003)
and so cannot account for the NAcc’s prediction of
risk-seeking but not risk-averse choices. Finally, a behavioral switching account predicts that NAcc activation will increase prior to any switch from a repeated
behavior to a novel behavior (Robbins et al., 1986).
While the influence of the NAcc in biasing choice was
most pronounced when subjects switched from riskaverse to risk-seeking choices, NAcc activation did not
predict switches in the opposite direction (from riskseeking to risk-averse choices). The same arguments
apply in reverse to the anterior insula predicting riskaverse choices. In either case, theories that fail to include the anticipated subjective value of an outcome
cannot easily account for the observed pattern of results.
Although both actual and relative gain outcomes increased activation in the MPFC, MPFC activation did
not predict subsequent risk-taking behavior, consistent
with its proposed role in representing gain prediction
error rather than gain prediction (Knutson et al., 2003).
Gain outcomes also activated other regions implicated

in decision making (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, medial
caudate, anterior cingulate cortex), but activation in
these regions also did not predict subsequent risktaking behavior. While activation in these regions do
not correlate with subsequent risk taking, these regions
may still play other important roles in decision making
(O’Doherty et al., 2003). For instance, anterior cingulate
foci showed increased activation under conditions of
increased response conflict, consistent with the postulated role of this region in conflict monitoring (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004).
The BIAS task offers a number of advantages in eliciting financial choice behavior. First, because the BIAS
task utilizes monetary incentives in a dynamic setting,
our findings may generalize to real-world trading scenarios. Second, the BIAS task enables identification of
both optimal choices and suboptimal choices. Third,
the BIAS task elicits a range of behaviors from each
individual, including both risk-seeking and risk-averse
choices. Fourth, the event-related design of the study
allowed us to correlate anticipatory rather than concurrent neural activation with choice by temporally isolat-

anticipatory activation and decision making occurred
prior to actual choice, the dynamic nature of the BIAS
task leaves open the question of whether anticipatory
activation preceded decision making or the reverse.
Some of the present findings support the idea that activation preceded decision making. Specifically, the link
between activation and subsequent choice critically
depended upon prior choice. For example, if NAcc activation simply reflected the decision to pick a stock,
then the relationship between NAcc activation and the
likelihood of choosing a stock should not depend upon
prior choice. However, anticipatory NAcc activation significantly predicted the likelihood of subsequent stock
choice only if the bond was picked on the previous trial
(see Table 3). The same argument also applies to insula
activation. Future research that specifically manipulates anticipatory activation could further establish
whether such activation influences decisions.
The dynamic nature of the BIAS task may have obscured stable individual differences in NAcc activation,
which might influence subsequent choice, but are more
evident in stationary tasks (Knutson et al., 2005). However, even during this dynamic task, significant individual differences were evident in insula activation during anticipation, and these predicted switching from
risky to riskless choices as well as the likelihood of
making risk-aversion mistakes while doing so. The link
between individual differences in anterior insula activation and subsequent risk-averse choices replicates and
extends prior findings (Paulus et al., 2003).
While experts and nonexperts who differed in terms
of prior coursework in finance and statistics did not significantly differ in behavior in this experiment, future research should also examine the influence of individual
differences in trading experience on financial risk taking, since psychophysiological evidence suggests
that experienced traders may show less emotional responsiveness to market events than inexperienced
traders (Lo and Repin, 2002). While many psychophysiological measures (e.g., skin conductance, heart rate,
pupillary dilation) index anticipatory arousal, the current
results suggest that measures that probe anticipatory
valence will also be necessary to predict the likelihood
of subsequent risky choice.
Overall, these findings suggest that risk-seeking
choices (such as gambling at a casino) and risk-averse
choices (such as buying insurance) may be driven by
two distinct neural circuits involving the NAcc and the
anterior insula. The findings are consistent with the notion that activation in the NAcc and anterior insula, respectively, index positive and negative anticipatory affective states and that activating one of these two
regions can lead to a shift in risk preferences. This may
explain why casinos surround their guests with reward
cues (e.g., inexpensive food, free liquor, surprise gifts,
potential jackpot prizes)—anticipation of rewards activates the NAcc, which may lead to an increase in the
likelihood of individuals switching from risk-averse to
risk-seeking behavior. A similar story in reverse may apply to the marketing strategies employed by insurance
companies.

Consideration of risk necessarily involves weighing
potential gains against potential losses. The notion that
distinct neural mechanisms anticipate gain versus loss
suggests a novel componential view of risk taking. Combined with such a view, these findings provide neural targets for investigating complex risk phenomena such as
loss aversion, in which people weigh losses more than
gains of equivalent size (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979).
These findings further imply that neuroeconomic research may foster a more comprehensive theory of individual decision making than the rational actor model
and thus may ultimately yield new insights relevant to
economic policy and institutional design.
Experimental Procedures
Nineteen healthy volunteers (10 females, mean age = 27, range =
24–39 years, right handed) participated in the study. Prior to entering the scanner, subjects played a practice version of the investment task for at least 10 min, minimizing learning effects. Subjects
were then shown the cash they could earn by performing the task
successfully and correctly reported believing that they would receive cash at the end of the experiment contingent upon their performance. Subjects received a fixed compensation of $20 per hour,
as well as a tenth of their total task earnings. They were also informed that it was possible to lose money on the task and that any
losses would be deducted from their total payment.
To elicit a range of investment behavior, subjects included both
“experts” and “nonexperts,” depending on whether they had taken
prior graduate coursework in statistics and finance. Experts included Ph.D. students in finance, economics, or accounting, while
nonexperts included Ph.D. students in humanities at Stanford University, to equate age, socioeconomic status, education, and intelligence. A 2 (expert versus nonexpert-between) × 20 (block-within)
analysis of variance revealed a main effect of block [F(19,323) =
2.35, p < 0.005], indicating that subjects chose the bond more often
as the experiment progressed. However, experts and nonexperts
did not significantly differ in choice of stocks versus bonds, either
overall (54% ± 6% versus 53% ± 6%) or across blocks. Experts
and nonexperts also did not significantly differ in the proportion of
risk-seeking mistakes [26% ± 6% versus 35% ± 8%; t(17) = 0.88,
n.s.] or risk-aversion mistakes they made overall [23% ± 6% versus
29% ± 6%; t(17) = 0.67, n.s.; calculated as percentage of mistakes
made on trials where mistakes of that type were possible], suggesting more of a performance continuum than distinct groupings.
Since choices and mistakes did not significantly differ between
experts and nonexperts, we combined groups in subsequent
analyses.
Behavioral Analysis
In the context of the BIAS task, the optimal strategy of a rational,
risk-neutral agent is to pick a stock if he or she expects to receive
a dividend that is at least as large as the bond earnings. Since the
actual monetary amounts at stake in each trial were small (−$1 to
$1), we used risk neutrality as the baseline model of investor behavior (Rabin, 2000), a model which assumes that individuals maximize expected return. A rational actor should also update his or
her beliefs about the probability of each stock being optimal according to Bayes’ rule. Based on these assumptions, we derived
the optimal portfolio selection strategy, which was the same for all
trials (see Supplementary Data).
For each trial, the objective probability of each of the two stocks
being dominant can be computed using Bayes’ rule. We refer to
the minimum of these two probabilities as “uncertainty” for that
trial. Uncertainty is highest (and equal to 0.5) at the beginning of a
block, when the probability of either stock being optimal is 50%,
and decreases as more information about dividends is revealed,
clarifying which stock dominates. On trials where uncertainty was
0.3 or lower, the optimal choice was one of the stocks—otherwise,
the optimal choice was the bond. Thus, when uncertainty is close
to the threshold value of 0.3, it is most difficult for subjects to deter-

<-----Page 6----->Neural Basis of Financial Risk Taking
769

mine the optimal strategy (i.e., whether to choose a bond versus
stock), leading to maximum conflict. Thus, uncertainty is maximal
when subjects cannot distinguish which of the two stocks is better,
while conflict is maximal when subjects cannot distinguish whether
it is better to choose a stock or the bond.
For each trial, we compared subjects’ investment choices to
those of a rational, risk-neutral agent. Deviations from this model
were defined as different types of “mistakes.” These mistakes fell
into three categories. Subjects might (1) pick a stock when the
bond was the optimal choice (“risk-seeking mistake”), (2) pick the
bond when a stock was the optimal choice (“risk-aversion mistake”), or (3) pick a stock when the other stock is the optimal
choice (“confusion mistake”). Confusion mistakes occurred in less
than 1% of the trials and thus were not considered in subsequent
analyses. We used logit models to predict the likelihood of choosing a stock or making either type of mistake conditional, as well as
unconditional, on prior choice.
We predicted that several behavioral variables would influence
subsequent choice (i.e., prior choice, prior outcome, relative earnings of chosen versus unchosen assets, cumulative earnings, and
uncertainty). Logistic regressions indicated that, when the prior
choice was a stock, lower relative earnings reduced the likelihood
of choosing a stock again (see Table 3). When the prior choice was
a bond, lower relative earnings increased the likelihood of switching to a stock. Moreover, as predicted and independent of prior
choice, increasing uncertainty increased the likelihood of choosing
the bond. These predicted findings provided behavioral evidence
for the validity of the task.
Additionally, and independent of prior choice, increasing cumulative earnings increased the likelihood of choosing a bond (see Table 3). When the prior choice was a stock, increasing cumulative
earnings also decreased the likelihood of making a risk-seeking
mistake. When the prior choice was a stock, decreased relative
earnings increased the likelihood of making a risk-aversion mistake
(see Table 4). On the other hand, when the prior choice was a bond,
decreased relative earnings increased the likelihood of making a
risk-seeking mistake (see Table 5). Outcomes also influenced subsequent choice. When the prior choice was a stock, increasing outcome increased the likelihood of choosing a bond as well as the
likelihood of making a risk-aversion mistake (see Tables 3 and 4).
Because behavioral variables including prior outcome, relative
earnings of the chosen versus unchosen asset, cumulative earnings, and uncertainty all influenced subsequent choice, we included them as covariates in prediction analyses.
fMRI Acquisition
Images were acquired with a 1.5T General Electric MRI scanner
using a standard birdcage quadrature head coil. Twenty-four 4 mm
thick slices (in-plane resolution 3.75 × 3.75 mm, no gap) extended
axially from the mid-pons to the top of the skull, providing adequate spatial resolution of subcortical regions of interest (e.g., midbrain, ventral striatum). Functional scans of the whole brain were
acquired every 2 s (TR = 2 s) with a T2*-sensitive in-/out- spiral
pulse sequence (TE = 40 ms, flip = 90°) designed to minimize signal
dropout at the base of the brain (Glover and Law, 2001). High-resolution structural scans were subsequently acquired using a T1weighted spoiled grass sequence (TR = 100 ms; TE = 7 ms, flip =
90°), facilitating subsequent localization and coregistration of functional data.
fMRI Analysis
Localization analyses were conducted using Analysis of Functional
Neural Images (AFNI) software (Cox, 1996). For preprocessing,
voxel time series were sinc interpolated to correct for nonsimultaneous slice acquisition within each volume, concatenated across
runs, and corrected for three-dimensional motion. Visual inspection
of motion correction estimates confirmed that no subject’s head
moved more than 2.0 mm in any dimension from one volume
acquisition to the next. Preprocessed time series were submitted
to a regression model that included three regressors indexing residual motion and six regressors modeling baseline, linear, and
quadratic trends for each of the two runs.
Regressors of interest were convolved with a γ-variate function

that modeled a canonical hemodynamic response prior to inclusion
in regression models (Cohen, 1997). Maps of t statistics for regressors of interest were transformed into Z scores, coregistered with
structural maps, spatially normalized by warping to Talairach
space, slightly spatially smoothed (FWHM = 4 mm) to minimize the
effects of anatomical variability, resampled at 2 mm3, and combined into a group map using a meta-analytic formula [average Z ×
sqrt(n)] (Knutson et al., 2000). Thresholds for statistical significance
within the predicted volumes of interest (i.e., NAcc, anterior insula,
and MPFC) were determined by a local small volume correction (3
4 mm radius spheres or 12.56 4 mm3 voxels corrected at p < 0.05
yields a threshold Z of 2.88, p < 0.004, uncorrected) and required a
minimum cluster of four contiguous voxels. Thresholds for statistical significance outside the predicted volumes of interest were set
using a global family-wise error rate that corrected for gray matter
volume in subcortical and mesial prefrontal cortical regions (approximately 500 4 mm3 voxels corrected at p < 0.05 yields a threshold Z of 3.88, p < 0.0001, uncorrected; Knutson et al., 2000) and
required a minimum cluster of four contiguous voxels.
As indicated by behavioral analyses, all fMRI analyses included
covariate regressors representing cumulative earnings (defined as
current wealth earned during the task, updated at each outcome
period) and uncertainty (updated at each market period). For outcome analyses, regressors of interest contrasted stock versus
bond choice, as well as gain versus loss outcome predicated on
stock choice. Because the BIAS task is a dynamic reward learning
task, we predicted that gain versus loss outcomes would activate
both the NAcc (gain prediction) and MPFC (gain prediction error)
(Knutson et al., 2003) and deactivate the anterior insula (Paulus et
al., 2003). For market analyses, the regressor of interest contrasted
amount earned on the current stock choice versus possible earnings from the unchosen stock, predicated on prior stock choice.
As with actual outcomes, we predicted that better relative earnings
during the market period would also activate the NAcc and MPFC.
Volumes of interest (VOIs) were specified as 8 mm diameter
spheres centered on foci identified in the outcome analysis in the
NAcc, MPFC, and insula (see Table 1), thereby ensuring that equal
amounts of data were extracted for each subject in each region.
Visual inspection confirmed that VOIs encompassed only gray
matter for each individual subject (Knutson et al., 2004). Additional
control volumes of interest of the same size and shape were specified in the bilateral anterior cingulate at foci correlated with uncertainty (TC = ±4, 16, 45), in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex at foci
correlated with outcome (TC = ±26, 36, −8), and in the bilateral
amygdala (TC = ±22, −10, −26), and bilateral medial caudate (TC =
±10, 7, 10), based on the Talairach atlas, in order to verify local
specificity of predicted effects.
Prediction analyses were conducted on activation time course
data that were spatially averaged and extracted from these VOIs.
Prediction analyses tested whether NAcc activation during anticipation was associated with subsequent stock choice as well as
risk-seeking mistakes, after controlling for potential behavioral
confounds. Prediction analyses also tested whether anterior insula
activation during anticipation was associated with subsequent
bond choice as well as risk-aversion mistakes, after controlling for
potential behavioral confounds. Additional analyses utilized identical models, but substituted data extracted from control VOIs.
Individual differences analyses were conducted by first using logistic regressions to determine whether subject fixed effects alone
had a significant influence on VOI activation during anticipation.
Given sufficient variability across subjects in activation during anticipation (e.g., fixed effects were significant in over 25% of the
subjects), logistic regressions were conducted that examined the
effects of individual differences in average VOI activation during
anticipation on the frequency of choosing the stock versus the
bond, as well as on the frequency of making risk-seeking or riskaversion mistakes.
