We review conjoint analysis (CA) usage in recent entrepreneurship research to assess how
researchers have used the method to study entrepreneurial decision making. We first provide
a brief overview of the method and present an exemplar study. We next examine how 16
studies published in leading entrepreneurship journals from 1999 to 2008 used CA, highlight
topics these studies have investigated most frequently, and suggest reasons why studies, in
general, have not used the method with greater frequency, despite its many advantages in
studying decision making. We conclude by suggesting potential future research applications
in an attempt to encourage greater CA usage in entrepreneurship research.

C

entral research questions in entrepreneurship include how and why some individuals
(or teams) identify opportunities, evaluate them as viable, and then decide to exploit
them, whereas others do not, and, in turn, how opportunities result in wealth creation (Brush
et al., 2003; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). Thus, both judgment and decision making represent critical components within the entrepreneurship process (Baron, 2006).
To examine these components, studies have frequently used surveys or interviews to
investigate why entrepreneurs decide to form and resource providers choose to invest in
new ventures. Although these methods have advanced the field, they often involve post hoc
data collection requiring respondents to remember and articulate past decisions, which may
result in recall bias and revisionism (Golden, 1992). Thus, other methods that overcome
these potential limitations are needed to study these critical issues (Busenitz et al., 2003).
Conjoint analysis (CA) represents one such method. Given its ability to partition decisionmaking processes into underlying respondent preferences for specific stimuli (e.g., product or
idea attributes), studies in various disciplines, particularly marketing, have often used CA
since Luce and Tukey (1964) first proposed it. Researchers have also long acknowledged the
potential value CA has for entrepreneurship research (DeSarbo, MacMillan, & Day, 1987).
For example, Shepherd and Zacharakis (1997, 1999) reviewed extant research, provided a
useful tutorial, and suggested topics where researchers could effectively use CA.

Despite both the long-standing recognition of its usefulness and valuable guidance in its
application, in the decade since the articles by Shepherd and Zacharakis were published,
entrepreneurship studies have rarely used CA. Indeed, Dean, Shook, and Payne (2007)
found studies had only used it to test 2% of hypotheses from 1976 through 2004 in two
leading entrepreneurship journals. Although this dearth in usage may result, in part, from
some studies examining topics not amenable to CA, decision making’s centrality in the field
suggests that opportunities exist for greater CA usage.
Accordingly, we review CA usage in entrepreneurship research published since
Shepherd and Zacharakis’ (1997, 1999) articles. First, we provide a brief overview of
CA. We then present an exemplar study to illustrate how it can aid in studying an issue
(i.e., risk taking) central to entrepreneurship research. We next examine how studies published in leading entrepreneurship journals from 1999 to 2008 have used CA, highlight
topics examined, and suggest reasons why the method has not been used more frequently.
We conclude by suggesting potential future research applications for CA when studying
entrepreneurial decision making.

Conjoint Analysis: A Brief Review
CA represents a specific set of ‘‘decompositional’’ research methods that researchers can
use to study decision-making processes (Green & Srinivasan, 1990). This method enables
researchers to partition respondents’ decisions into underlying preference structures and
decision rules by collecting data as respondents make decisions. Thus, researchers can
assess respondents’ ‘‘theory in use’’ rather than their ‘‘espoused theories of action,’’ which
is frequently captured when surveying respondents about past decisions (Argyris & Schon,
1974). In doing so, CA avoids validity threats such as post hoc revisionism based on social
desirability, faulty memory, or inability to articulate complex decision processes (Shepherd
& Zacharakis, 1997).
Early forms of CA grew out of the article by Luce and Tukey (1964) on conjoint measurement. Green and Rao (1971), recognizing its value for answering key marketing
research questions (e.g., ‘‘How do consumers choose among products with different attributes?’’), describe a ‘‘full-profile card-sort’’ CA using a precisely designed deck of cards
with different product profiles that they developed from a standard orthogonal experimental
design. As later studies became more complex (e.g., adding interactions), however, this
method could sometimes become unwieldy, requiring researchers to develop alternative
methods for presenting decision choices to respondents.1
Regardless of the specific method used, CA researchers generally present decision tasks
to respondents, who provide their preferences for products or concepts having different levels (e.g., high/medium/low or red/blue/green) of different attributes (e.g., expected product
reliability or color). Ratings or rankings then serve as the dependent variable and attribute
levels serve as independent variables in the general equation
Y ¼ b1 X1 þ b2 X2 þ . . . bn Xn þ E

ð1Þ

where b, referred to as ‘‘part-worths’’ in CA, represents the relative importance of an attribute, and n equals number of attributes. Readers will note that Equation (1) closely

<-----Page 3----->18 Organizational Research Methods

resembles an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or standard regression equation. Indeed, in its
simplest form, CA is similar to an ANOVA where attribute levels are dummy- or contrastcoded. Like other multivariate methods used to investigate dependence relationships (e.g.,
discriminant analysis), CA derives a linear function of attribute levels that minimizes error
between actual and estimated values. Researchers can use several software packages (e.g.,
SAS or Sawtooth) to estimate this function (see, e.g., http://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/
education/techpap.shtml).
One unique aspect of CA, however, involves how researchers collect data to estimate this
linear function. With a ‘‘compositional’’ research approach, researchers obtain both independent and dependent variables from respondents and then use these data to estimate or
‘‘compose’’ the predictive model. In contrast, with CA, researchers specify levels for each
attribute (i.e., independent variable) and then present respondents with scenarios having
attributes with different combinations of these levels. Because levels are known, researchers need only to collect respondent ratings to use as the dependent variable. In doing so, they
can estimate or ‘‘decompose’’ the importance that respondents assign to each attribute
(Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006). In short, independent variable levels are
set by the researcher in CA and chosen by the respondents with compositional methods. The
advantage with CA is that researchers can learn how important different attributes are to
respondents by forcing them to make trade offs in real time.
For example, studies using a compositional research approach might ask questions like:
‘‘After reading Firm #1’s business plan, please answer the following:’’
Far below average
How strong is top management’s industry experience?
How protected is the product’s niche from competitive entry?
How high is the industry’s potential market growth rate?

Researchers could then use these ratings as independent variables to predict each
attribute’s overall importance in investment decisions. For example, in a seminal study,
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) asked venture capitalists (VCs) to consider a current investment
opportunity and rate its expected return, failure risk, industry, company, and management
attributes. Using regression analysis, they found market attractiveness (e.g., growth rate)
and product differentiation (e.g., uniqueness) were significantly related to expected return,
whereas managerial capabilities (e.g., finance skills) and environmental threat resistance
(e.g., high entry barriers) were significantly related to failure risk.
In contrast, a study using a decompositional, CA method might present the following:

Top management’s industry experience (years)
Product niche entry barriers
Potential market growth rate (%)

Researchers could present descriptions individually and ask respondents to indicate the
probability they would invest, have them select the one they are more likely to invest in

19

from paired comparisons, or ask them to rank all ventures from most or least likely for
investment. With CA, respondents only provide the dependent variable (e.g., investment
probability or firm ranking) because independent variables are fixed at known levels.
Researchers could then estimate attribute importance using one of several multivariate statistical methods (e.g., ordinary least squares [OLS] or logit regression), depending on factors such as whether the dependent variable is continuous or binary. For example, Shepherd
(1999) presented VCs with new venture descriptions and asked them to rate survival probability based on each one’s industry, company, and management attributes. Using regression analysis, he found that management attributes (e.g., industry experience) were the
most important ones related to VCs’ survival probability ratings.
Although CA studies often use the same statistical methods (e.g., regression analysis) as
those using compositional methods, CA offers several relative benefits when studying
decision-making issues. Most importantly, it is specifically designed to assess respondents’
‘‘theory in use’’ by capturing respondents’ preferences as they make decisions. In contrast,
studies using compositional research designs have often used retrospective accounts to study
critical decision-making issues. For example, although Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) asked
VCs to assess a current investment opportunity, other studies have often asked VCs to recall
investment decisions and rank criteria they used in making those decisions. Although retrospective accounts are often necessary in organizational research, they may produce biased
results if respondents are unwilling or unable to recall their decision processes.
CA is also unique in that it can be used to examine preferences at the individual and/or
group (‘‘aggregate’’) level. In addition, whereas many multivariate methods require all
independent variables to have the same (e.g., linear) relationship with the dependent variable, CA allows each to have a different (e.g., linear, quadratic, or stepwise) one, making it
extremely flexible when investigating complex decision-making issues (Hair et al., 2006).
Given these advantages, extant entrepreneurship research has used CA to examine some
key issues, but, historically, studies have examined a narrow range of topics. For example,
Shepherd and Zacharakis (1997) found, with limited exception (e.g., DeSarbo et al., 1987),
studies used CA primarily to investigate VC decisions. They (1999) also reviewed VC
studies and concluded that VCs often used different decision criteria when completing a
CA task than when asked about their decisions post hoc via surveys, which the authors
noted provided additional evidence of CA’s advantages in studying entrepreneurial decision
making.
With its increasing use across disciplines, recent tutorials have examined critical
research design issues related to CA. To highlight some of these issues prior to reviewing
CA usage in entrepreneurship research, we briefly review an exemplar study.2

An Exemplar Study
McMullen and Shepherd (2006) used CA to examine factors affecting whether untenured
assistant professors would take risks inherent in attempting to publish consensuschallenging research. We chose their study for three reasons. First, although they did not
directly study the entrepreneurship process, they examined a concept (i.e., risk taking) central to it. Second, they used some of the most current CA methods to test their hypotheses.

<-----Page 5----->20 Organizational Research Methods

Third, their research questions should interest many readers, thus making the example more
salient.
McMullen and Shepherd used self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1977) to develop their
hypotheses, which states that people decide to complete a task based both on whether they
perceive they have the ability (i.e., ‘‘efficacy’’) to successfully finish it and they will obtain
an outcome they desire. Thus, the authors posited that when presented with scenarios
having high anticipated rewards (punishments) and low (high) time pressure, professors
would choose the higher (lower) risk research path, especially when told they had high
(low) research skills.
To test these hypotheses, they developed scenarios using various combinations of attributes (e.g., rewards and time pressure) and levels (e.g., high and low). For example, they
operationalized high (low) time pressure as ‘‘You have two (five) years before your review
for tenure.’’ Because self-efficacy theory posits that efficacy and expected outcomes interact, the authors also designed scenarios to test these interactions. They then pretested these
and used an 11-point Likert scale anchored with ‘‘incremental’’ and ‘‘radical research’’
choices having a 90% and unknown success probability, respectively, as the dependent variable. To control potential autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in responses, they used
hierarchical linear modeling. In general, results supported their hypotheses.

Conjoint Analysis Use in Entrepreneurship Research
To assess CA use in entrepreneurship research since the reviews by Shepherd and
Zacharakis (1997, 1999), we electronically and manually searched leading entrepreneurship
journals as defined by Fried (2003) from 1999 to 2008. We also added Journal of International Business Studies because it frequently publishes entrepreneurship research and
has been included in previous methodological reviews (Ketchen & Shook, 1996). Although
this method may preclude some studies in other outlets (e.g., books) or from related disciplines (e.g., marketing), it should provide a broad view of recent CA usage within the field.
We searched for empirical studies that examined entrepreneurship process issues and
located 16 studies, which we coded according to topic and research methods. Results provide some general conclusions about recent CA usage in entrepreneurship research (see
Table 1).
First, studies used a large proportion of non-U.S. and multinational samples and were
conducted by a limited number of authors. Second, comparing our results with the results
of Shepherd and Zacharakis (1997) indicates that research continues to use CA most heavily
when examining venture financing issues. Specifically, 6 of the 16 studies investigated how
VCs assess new ventures, one studied how entrepreneurs assess VC firms, and two examined how loan officers assess new ventures. The remaining studies examined other key
decision-making concepts including opportunity exploitation, self-employment as a career
choice, family business succession, and new venture legitimacy. Third, CA usage is trending upward with 37.5% and 63.5% of studies published in the first and second halves of our
review time frame, respectively.
Table 1 also shows that most studies used similar methods and generally used CA consistent with best practices (e.g., Aiman-Smith, Scullen, & Barr, 2002; Karren & Barringer,

2002). For example, most used regression to analyze data, with an increasing number using
hierarchical linear modeling to control for autocorrelation that may result from using multiple ratings from the same rater. All studies also used one or more internal validation
methods.
In contrast, none assessed external validity by using their resulting models to predict outcomes with another sample. In addition, most examined linear relationships, despite both
CA’s ability to examine other (e.g., quadratic) relationships and the frequent supposition
that these more complex relationships can exist in some entrepreneurial phenomenon
(e.g., perceived risk and subsequent action).
Although these results show that CA usage has increased, 16 studies in 10 years from 25
journals still represent a fairly low usage rate. Given both the recurring recommendations
for greater CA usage and the field’s permeable boundaries with related disciplines (e.g.,
marketing) that frequently use this method, our findings remain somewhat surprising. Several factors related to CA’s limitations and entrepreneurship scholar training may help
explain this dearth in usage.

Conjoint Analysis Limitations
Although scholars have made tremendous progress in the past 30 years refining CA
methods to study decision-making processes, like all methods, it has limitations, which may
have discouraged its use in entrepreneurship studies. Researchers have noted, for example,
that because studies are often conducted in hypothetical contexts lacking actual consequences, the degree to which CA identifies ‘‘true’’ preference structures can be questioned.
In particular, research in experimental economics indicates that when data collection lacks
true (dis)incentives to motivate behavior, respondents may not expend the cognitive effort
needed to reveal true judgments, resulting in unreliable data (Smith & Walker, 1993). In an
attempt to address these limitations, recent research has applied incentive-aligned choice
CA to provide more realistic incentive structures (e.g., Ding, Grewal, & Liechty, 2005).
Researchers can also conduct posttests to have respondents rate how closely scenarios
matched their key decision-making criteria (DeTienne, Shepherd, & De Castro, 2008).
In addition, similar to laboratory studies, CA requires that researchers know a priori
the most critical attributes and levels affecting respondent decision making, introducing
challenges for a relatively young field such as entrepreneurship, where theory development
has often dominated theory testing. In research areas such as VC decision making, where
substantial theory and empirical results exist, CA has enjoyed frequent use. In other
research areas still focusing primarily on theory development, however, CA will remain
less applicable.
Similarly, the need for researchers to collect primary data may have also reduced CA
usage in entrepreneurship research. As noted above, most studies have sampled VCs and
loan officers, who can be readily identified and contacted. In contrast, finding other important groups (e.g., nascent entrepreneurs) may be substantially more challenging. CA’s
requirement that scenarios be developed a priori also precludes using databases (e.g., the
Kauffman Foundation Survey, Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics, and Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) that have become key data sources within the field in the last decade.

<-----Page 9----->24 Organizational Research Methods

In addition, CA may have limited applicability when assessing preferences for futuristic
scenarios because high respondent uncertainty makes accurate responses difficult.
Although recent research (e.g., Hoeffler, 2003) has proposed techniques for improving
measurement in these contexts, a strong need remains to improve CA reliability when using
scenarios based on novel situations that comprise many entrepreneurship research
questions.

Entrepreneurship Scholar Training
Beyond these potential limitations, a second major reason for limited CA use may be that
entrepreneurship researchers lack training in the method. For example, when Dean et al.
(2007) surveyed both newly minted PhDs and senior entrepreneurship scholars, the former
indicated they had limited ability to use CA. In contrast, the latter rated CA above the scale
midpoint for its future importance to the field. Although scores fell well below those for
other multivariate methods (e.g., multiple regression and factor analysis), these results may
signal an increasing recognition that CA should be in entrepreneurship researchers’ tool kit.
To examine this possibility as well as to survey the field’s CA ‘‘research pipeline,’’ we
conducted a follow-up survey by electronically searching presentations at four leading academic conferences, the Academy of Management, Babson College Entrepreneurship
Research Conference, the U.S. Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and
International Council for Small Business, from 2006 to 2008. Although we could not conduct an in-depth analysis similar to the review above, given that only abstracts were available for many manuscripts, we found 14 additional studies using CA. In contrast to our
journal review, only about one third of these investigated VC topics compared to over half
the journal articles we examined. The remainder focused on opportunity evaluation and
exploitation, corporate entrepreneurship, and intertemporal decision making. Although
these represent a small percentage of articles presented at these conferences, these results
are encouraging because they provide some evidence that sustained interest exists for using
CA in entrepreneurship research.

Future Directions
We can generally conclude from our literature review that extant studies have underused
CA to examine entrepreneurial decision making, especially given the method’s direct
applicability to many of the field’s most important research questions. To provide guidance
in applying CA to study these questions, we examine several future research avenues.
Shepherd and Zacharakis (1997) recommended several topics where entrepreneurship
studies could fruitfully use CA by drawing from economics (e.g., decision-making rationality), social psychology (e.g., decision anchoring under uncertainty), marketing (e.g., liability of newness), and extant entrepreneurship research (e.g., strategic decision making).
Subsequently, other researchers have recommended other topics, including corporate venturing (Shepherd & Krueger, 2002) and entrepreneurial intuition (Mitchell, Friga, & Mitchell, 2005). As noted, extant CA studies have examined some (e.g., liability of newness) but
not all of these topics, indicating that several important research opportunities still exist.

<-----Page 10----->Lohrke et al. / Conjoint Analysis in Entrepreneurship Research

25

Building on these suggestions, we highlight several other areas where researchers could
use CA to study entrepreneurial decision making. In general, CA could potentially revive
research studying individual-level phenomenon, an area that has been somewhat deemphasized following widespread disillusionment with the ‘‘trait’’ approach (Gartner, 1990).
Because entrepreneurship occurs at the individual-opportunity nexus (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), however, deemphasizing the former is not a viable option. One issue with previous (especially trait-based) studies is they often proxied decision making with
demographic (e.g., age) or attitudinal (e.g., need for achievement) attributes, resulting in
a decision making ‘‘black box’’ (Mitchell et al., 2005). With its advantages in examining
respondents’ ‘‘theory in use,’’ however, CA may help open this box by providing insight
into entrepreneurial decision making. Thus, we next examine some of these possible topics
within the entrepreneurship process.3

Opportunity Identification
To form and grow a new venture, entrepreneurs must first identify potential opportunities. These can arise from different sources, including exogenous shocks to an economy or
asymmetric information possessed by different individuals (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003), but
several factors may influence the likelihood that an individual will recognize an opportunity: a person’s access to information from different life experiences (e.g., employment),
social network involvement, personality traits (e.g., creativity), and cognitive ability to
‘‘connect the dots’’ among diverse trends (Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003; Baron, 2006).
Although some agreement exists about factors that may affect opportunity identification,
considerable debate continues about the cognitive processes that entrepreneurs use to identify them (Shook, Priem, & McGee, 2003). One view suggests that potential entrepreneurs
intend to start new ventures, and, thus, they systematically scan environmental trends for
opportunities. Another suggests that individuals having higher ‘‘entrepreneurial alertness’’
can discover opportunities, sometimes without actively searching for them (Kirzner, 1997).
One possible resolution to this debate may reside in the nature of the opportunity examined (e.g., how codified vs. tacit it is, see Smith, Matthews, & Schenkel, 2009). Different
entrepreneurs, however, may also use different decision-making processes, and it is in this
latter area where researchers might successfully use CA to study opportunity identification.
For example, to examine the deliberate approach, future research could examine how nascent entrepreneurs respond to changing industry conditions (see Oppewal, Louviere, &
Timmermans, 2000). In addition, research could use CA to examine whether differences
in respondents’ entrepreneurial alertness levels lead to different decisions related to opportunity identification. Gaglio and Katz (2001) suggested that mixed results across entrepreneurship alertness studies, to date, may arise from frequent reliance on post hoc data
collection. Thus, using CA to examine issues relevant to this debate appears to be a critical
future research avenue.
Along with this general debate, other factors potentially affecting opportunity identification related to knowledge, personality, or pattern recognition could be examined with CA.
For example, Baron and Ensley (2006) studied whether nascent and experienced entrepreneurs possessed different mental ‘‘prototypes’’ for new ventures that affected their
opportunity-recognition abilities. They content-analyzed retrospective accounts and found

<-----Page 11----->26 Organizational Research Methods

that these groups varied in both the number and type of attributes that they used in decisions.
Thus, future research could use CA to triangulate and build on these results by assessing
how these different groups make trade offs among different criteria when identifying
opportunities.

Opportunity Evaluation
After identifying an opportunity, entrepreneurs must forecast, often under conditions of
high environmental uncertainty, the opportunity’s expected value based on both the potential costs and benefits of exploiting it (Keh, Foo, & Lim, 2002). Key potential stakeholders
must conduct similar calculations when deciding whether to become involved with the new
venture. Costs may include actual expenditures or opportunity costs from foregoing other
options, and benefits may include financial or psychological gains (Shane & Venkataraman,
2000).
Research has examined how myriad characteristics, including background (e.g., work
experience), attitudinal factors (e.g., self-efficacy), psychological attributes (e.g., risktaking propensity), and cognitive processes (e.g., biases), affect opportunity evaluation
(e.g., Markman, Balkin, & Baron, 2002; Ucbasaran, Westhead, & Wright, 2008). One
long-standing issue, however, involves whether entrepreneurs are willing to pursue higher
risk opportunities than nonentrepreneurs (Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 2000). Given that
starting new ventures, in general, requires entrepreneurs to take several (e.g., financial and
reputational) risks, the widely shared view that they have higher risk taking propensities or
risk tolerances than nonentrepreneurs remains intuitively appealing (Norton & Moore,
2006). Empirical results, to date, however, have been decidedly mixed. One explanation
may be that entrepreneurs categorize risks differently than nonentrepreneurs, and, as a
result, they may not perceive themselves as taking abnormally high risks when asked to
self-assess their actions (Palich & Bagby, 1995). In addition, Janney and Dess (2006) suggest that some risk measures may have limited applicability when studying entrepreneurs
because their primary concerns (e.g., ownership dilution from issuing equity), and, in turn,
risk perceptions differ from managers in established firms.
A second major research area involves how entrepreneurs use biases or heuristics when
evaluating opportunities. For example, research suggests that entrepreneurs may have a
higher propensity to use some biases (e.g., escalation of commitment) than nonentrepreneurs when evaluating opportunities (Baron, 1998). In addition, entrepreneurs and stakeholders (e.g., VCs) may rely on heuristics or ‘‘mental shortcut’’ when evaluating
opportunities (Busenitz & Barney, 1997). Although using these heuristics can expedite
opportunity evaluation, which may provide a critical advantage in pursuing the opportunity,
they can also systematically bias the decision-making process.
To date, researchers have frequently used CA to examine VCs’ and, to a lesser extent,
entrepreneurs’ (e.g., Choi & Shepherd, 2004) criteria for evaluating opportunities. Some
have also examined how specific biases can affect these assessments (e.g. DeTienne
et al., 2008). Future studies, however, could use CA to study issues related to risk taking
and other decision-making biases. For example, one useful distinction that may help resolve
issues about whether entrepreneurs tolerate risk better than nonentrepreneurs involves
dividing risk into perceptions, which may be influenced by how a problem is framed

27

(e.g., potential gain or loss), and propensity, which is the tendency to take or avoid risk
based on previous (e.g., positive or negative risk-taking) experiences (Sitkin & Weingart,
1995). Thus, researchers could use well-established theories (e.g., prospect theory, Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and constructs (e.g., entrepreneurial experience, Ucbasaran et al.,
2008) to design a CA study examining risk taking.
Beyond its ability to reveal preferences, factors related to how respondents complete a
CA task (e.g., speed) may also provide insights into opportunity evaluation. For example,
although rapid task completion could evidence lack of effort, it can also indicate that
respondents used heuristics rather than more rational decision-making criteria (Hair
et al., 2006). In addition, Franke, Gruber, Harhoff, and Henkel (2008) noted that CA also
can be used to assess whether respondents use compensatory (e.g., a venture weakness can
be counterbalanced by a strength) versus noncompensatory (e.g., a weakness serves as a
‘‘knock-out’’ criterion) decision making in evaluating opportunities. Thus, CA could be
used to study both how entrepreneurs cope with resources not under their direct control and
which resource deficiencies can derail the opportunity evaluation process. In addition, it
could be used to examine how entrepreneurs trade off important future performance
outcomes when engaging in the cost/benefit calculus of opportunity evaluation. For
example, building on social-cause marketing studies (Bloom, Hoeffler, Keller, & Meza,
2006), researchers could examine how entrepreneurs trade off potential ‘‘double’’ or
‘‘triple’’ bottom-line outcomes in socially entrepreneurial firms (Austin, Stevenson, &
Wei-Skillern, 2006).

Opportunity Exploitation
After evaluating whether opportunities are viable, entrepreneurs must then decide how
best to exploit them. One fundamental choice involves whether to pursue or sell the opportunity. The field has primarily focused on the former, which raises a second important question related to how entrepreneurs assemble resources necessary to exploit opportunities
(Shane, 2003).
In examining these issues, research has focused on factors that lead to new venture creation as well as the different organizational forms these new ventures can use (Brush et al.,
2003). Many key issues related to opportunity exploitation involve gaining access to critical
resources. Entrepreneurs, however, often face significant hurdles because potential stakeholders may be reluctant to conduct business with a new venture lacking an established
track record. These ‘‘liabilities of newness’’ issues can result in firm failure, so finding ways
to overcome them represents a critical opportunity exploitation issue (Stinchcombe, 1965).
To date, however, most research has focused on external liability of newness issues (e.g.,
stakeholder perceptions). Thus, future research could use CA to examine several internal
liability issues noted by Stinchcombe (1965), including the need to develop organizational
routines and establish trust among managers. Trust, in particular, represents a fundamental
issue for entrepreneurship research, in general (Venkataraman, 1997), and organizational
research has identified several different forms that can exist (e.g., Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt,
& Camerer, 1998). In addition, research has recently used CA to study trust (e.g., Schoder
& Haenlein, 2004), which future entrepreneurship studies could build on to examine important issues within the field.

Conclusion
This article provides an updated examination of CA usage in entrepreneurship research
since the reviews by Shepherd and Zacharakis (1997, 1999). In general, we found that studies have increasingly used CA in recent years, and our research pipeline survey suggests this
upward trend should continue.
One central conclusion from our review is that CA can enhance entrepreneurship
research by allowing researchers to assess decision makers’ ‘‘theories in use.’’ Thus, future
studies can investigate whether extant findings based on post hoc methods sustain when
tested using CA. In cases where discrepancies occur, opportunities exist to resolve disparate
findings. In addition, we suggested a number of potential applications of CA in the study of
entrepreneurial decision making. We hope that through our review and recommendations,
we help encourage greater CA usage in future entrepreneurship research.

Notes
1. Given the large number of recent, excellent tutorials covering conjoint analysis, we do not focus specifically on the mechanics of the method, instead referring interested readers to several useful sources (e.g.,
Aiman-Smith et al., 2002; Hair et al., 2006; Karren & Barringer, 2002).
2. We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this approach.
3. Although, arguably, many of these topics can span decision making across multiple steps in the process,
we discuss each within the primary step within which it has been investigated, to date, in entrepreneurship
research.
