Business Similarity as a
Moderator of the
Relationship Between PreOwnership Experience and
Venture Performance
Gaylen N. Chandler
This research focuses on the degree of similiarity between pre-ownership experience and the
work requirements of the present venture as a moderator of the relationship between pre-ownership experience and venture performance. Multiple itme scales are developed to assess two
dimensions of business similarity: (1) talk environment similarity, and (2) skills/abilities similarity. The results indicate a positive main effect for task enviroment similarity and a curvilinear
moderation effect for skill/abilities similarity. Qualitative interviews are used to help better
explain the results.

lere is little dispute among venture capitalist.s and practitioners that the expertise and
behaviors of the founder influence the performance fo the firm. However, much of the extant
entrepreneurship research dealing with the relationship between founders and their ventures has
focused on years of experience aws a proxy for the knowledge and competencies developed by
the founder. There is evidence tha the years of pre-ownership experience in similar businesses
is positively related to the performance of the venture (Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Cooper &
Gimeno-Gascon, 1992; Cooper, Gimeno-Gascon, & Woo, 1994; Dunkelberg & Cooper, 1982;
Dunkelbery, Cooper, Woo, & Dennis, 1987; MacMillan, Siegel, & SubbaNarasimha, 1985;
Stuart & Abetti, 1990). Other researchers (e.g. Van de Ven, Hudson, & Schroeder, 1984) have
found no relationships. Thus, the evidence has been relatively weak and not entirely consistent.
The inconsistency of these finding suggests that perhaps pre-ownership exposure to business activities does not automatically translate into knowledge, skills, and abilities that can successfully be applied to the situation found in the start-up venture (Reuber & Fischer, 1994). The
present research seeks to explore some of the issues involved in transferring the knowledge,
skill, and abilities gained through pre-ownership activities to the application of starting a new
business. In so doing, it seeks to make three contributions to our knowledge. First, it identifies
two dimensions of experience; (1) task environment similarity, and (2) skills/abilities similarity.
It then discusses how these dimensions relate to the pertbrmance of the venture. Second, it provides evidence supportive of the empirical validity of scales that can be used to operationalize
task environment similarity and skills/abilities similarity. Third, it develops and provides tests
for the theoretically based hypotheses.

KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ABILITIES AND PERFORMANCE
Pre-ownership experience in a highly related field is thought to be an important correlate of
emerging business performance (Dunkelberg et al., 1987; Stuart & Abetti, 1990; Tyebjee &
Bruno, 1984). However, if experience is to be beneficial to a start-up company, the knowledge.
Spring, 1996

<-----Page 1----->skills, and abilities learned through experience must be transferred from a pre-ownership situation to the setting of the emerging business. In addition, the impact of the transferred learning
must be strong enough to translate into organizational-level results.

Two Dimensions of Business Similarity
To help develop hypotheses, I have relied on the literaUire along with insights gained
through in-depth interviews with 10 business founders. The review of the literature and discussions with business founders revealed two major dimensions of knowledge, skills, and abilities:
(1) task environment knowledge, and (2) specific skills and abilities.
Task environment similarity. Pre-ownership experience in a highly similar business allows
founders to better understand the context within which their emerging firm will operate (Cooper
et al. 1994). Drucker (1994) states that managers must make assumptions about markets, customers, and technologies when they make business decisions. Porter (1980) discusses the importance of knowing and assessing the environment. Indeed, numerous entrepreneurship
researchers have emphasized the importance of recognizing opportunities and accurately evaluating the environment (e.g. Hofer & Sandberg. 1987; Kunkel, 1991; Timmons. 1990). Such
research highlights the importance of understanding the context within which a firm operates.
Pre-ownership experience in the task environment can help the business founder better
understand the benefits and limitations of any given technology. This knowledge is important as
emerging businesses interact with three major constituencies: customers, suppliers, and competitors.
Pre-ownership experience in a highly similar business helps founders to better understand
the customers. This exposure not only helps founders recognize what customers want, but also
helps them meet customers and develop a working relationship with them. In our interviews with
business founders we found that often pre-ownership experiences had allowed them to become
acquainted with a customer base locally, nationally, and internationally.
In order to maintain good customer service it is important to identify reliable suppliers. Preownership experience in similar businesses exposes founders to suppliers. Porter (1980) discusses the importance of suppliers and supplier power. As illustrated by the following anecdotes,
this may be particularly important tor start-up firms. In my interviews I encountered two
founders who were able to start businesses because they developed contacts with suppliers and
were supported financially by the supplier when the business started. In one case, the supplier
provided goods on consignment until the business was established, and in the second case, the
supplier provided a low-interest loan with generous repayment terms.
Understanding competitors also becomes important. Researchers have discussed the importance of hostile versus benign environments (Covin & Slevin, 1989). Understanding how competitors do business and what they focus on can help a founder to comprehend and develop a
more appropriate niche (Timmons, 1990). In my interviews there were eight founders who
developed products to fit niches where there were no direct competitors. In another case, however, a founder decided not to open a retail establishment because a major competitor was percieved to have enough power to create extreme competitive pressure as well as an ability to
orchestrate political pressure through the zoning commission. This insight allowed the founder
to avoid significant future hostilities.
The cited literature and case examples are consistent with previous arguments (Cooper et al.
1994) that business similarity implies knowledge of the task-level environment. This knowledge
does not equate with any specific skill or ability, but rather provides more accurate information
to increase the efficacy of decision making.
Skill/ahility similarity. In addition to gaining knowledge of the task environment, individuals are thought to develop specific managerial and technical skills that can be of use in an emerging business. Numerous studies have evaluated founder experience, but two recent studies have
developed models of entrepreneurial expertise. Both Chandler and Jansen (1992) and Reuber
and Fischer (1994) developed models that included multidimensional measures of managerial
52

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->expertise. Both models included items to measure the founder's managerial competence in organizing, coordinating, planning, and motivating people. Finally, both models included measures
of technical competence such as research and development and production.
These studies suggest that pre-ownership experience can facilitate the learning of specific
managerial and technical skills that will be useful to the founder in the start-up business.
Specific skills and abilities are conceptually different from the broader task environment knowledge. Task environment knowledge implies that the potential founder has gained knowledge
about the product, customers, suppliers, and competitors that can aid in strategy formulation.
The acquisition of specific skills and abilities implies that the founder has developed managerial and technical expertise that will aid in strategy implementation.

Business Similarity and Experience
Previous researchers have stated that experience in similar businesses seems to be more
valuable than experience in less similar settings. Cooper et al. (1994) operationalized the construct of business simlarity as a three-item scale measuring similarity in services, customers, and
suppliers. This operationalization is consistent with my conceptualization of task environment
similarity. Stuart and Abetti (1990) operationalized business similarity as the compatibility of
skills learned through experience, which is more congruous with my conceptualization of
skills/abilities similarity.
In each of these cases, the variables were tested as direct independent variables in the analysis. Although the direct effects are of interest, testing only the direct effects assumes that business
similarity leads to performance. It can be strongly argued that it is not business similarity or years
of experience that is directly related to performance, but rather the acquisition and application of
knowledge, skills, and abilities (Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Reuber & Fischer, 1994). From this
perspective, I expect not only veritlable relationships between the two dimensions of business
similarity and performance, but also moderating effects that extend beyond the relationships
exhibited by the original variables. Thus, I expect task environment similarity and skills/abilities
similarity to moderate the relationship between years of pre-ownership experience and the performance of the emerging venture. This suggests the model displayed in Figure 1.

<-----Page 3----->The preceding discussion leads to the statement of the following hypotheses:
HI: There are two conceptually distinct dimensions of knowledge, skills, and abilities
gained through experience. The first is knowledge of the task environment, the second is
specific managerial and technical skills.
H2: Task environment similarity is positively related to venture sales/earnings and
growth.
H3: SkilLs/abilities similarity is positively related to venture sales/earnings and growth.
H4: Task environment similarity positively moderates the relationship between experience and new venture performance.
H5: Skills/abilities similarity positively moderates the relationship between experience
and new venture performance.

Issues Obscuring Relationships
With respect to skills/abilities similarity there may be founders who believed they learned
appropriate skills and abilities from the prior firm, and yet in the prior firm they did many things
wrong! Thus, the skills/abilities similarity measure may be clouded by inappropriate learning in
the prior firm.
Even if positive transfer of experience occurs, research focusing on founder competencies
and venture performance must overcome the liabilities associated with cross-level research
(Rousseau, 1985). Frequently such relationships are difficult to verify because firm performance
is a function of environmental, firm, and individual-level constructs (Chandler & Hanks, 1994).
Thus, existing relationships might be obscured by extraneous factors. This is less likely to occur,
however, in the setting of emerging businesses. Start-up firms are characterized by simple structure and a culture defined by the founder's vision; hence, more internal consistency in culture
and climate and fewer diverging internal forces. Therefore, in the setting of start-up firms, more
evidence of cross-level responsiveness between individual and firm-level constructs and
stronger evidence of coupling between the founder's learning transfer and the performance of
the emerging venture are expected than if larger, more complex firms were analyzed.
In addition to the difficulties associated with cross-level research, the research model proposed in this paper is not intended to be a comprehensive model of venture performance.
Researchers have proposed and tested variables at environmental, organizational, and individual
levels of analysis (e.g. Chandler & Hanks, 1994; Hofer & Sandberg, 1987; Covin & Slevin,
1989). Even comprehensive models rarely explain large proportions of the total variance in venture performance. This may occur because the models are not adequately specified, there is error
in measurement, there is inherent randomness, or a combination of the above.
Eor these reasons, the models tested in this paper are not expected to explain large amounts
of variance; rather they seek to provide greater insights into the phenomenon of how knowledge
gained through experience is related to venture performance. This is done by evaluating relationships between these constructs and new venture performance. Only modest magnitude of
effects is expected; however, given the complexities inherent in this type of research, significant
findings provide relatively strong evidence of the importance of the identified constructs.

Control Variables
Because the research seeks to evaluate differences between individual- and organizationallevel constructs, a number of control variables are appropriate. The dependent variables are business growth and business volume. Research shows that as firms age, growth tends to slow
(Hanks, Watson, Jansen, & Chandler, 1993). In addition, we expect eight-year-old firms on average to have higher sales levels than two-year-old firms. Thus, in the context of emerging businesses, business age is an appropriate control variable.
There is some evidence that the industry in which a firm competes may have some impact
54

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->on the performance of the firm. Firms for the study were selected from manufacturing, retail,
wholesale and business services industries. To provide controls for potential differences in these
areas, business type is a control variable.
Pre-ownership experience is not the focal point of this study, but rather the interaction
between experience and task environment and skills/abilities similarity. Thus it is necessary to
include experience as a control variable in order to capture interaction effects beyond the main
effects explained by experience.

METHODS
The research is cross-sectional and cross-level in nature. It is designed to provide evidence
for the validity of measurement of the task environment similarity and skills/abilities similarity
constructs. It also seeks to assess the relationship between these constructs and new venture performance.

Sample
The sample was selected from State of Utah records of business incorporations.
Questionnaires were mailed to the founders of all firms (n = 431) in four types of businesses —
manufacturing, retail, wholesale, and business services—that met the following criteria: (1) they
incorporated between January 1985 and June 1988; (2) they were in good standing with the state
as of February, 1990; and (3) they were not subsidiaries of parent corporations. The data collection procedure followed that was proposed by Dillman (1978). Of the 431 questionnaires
mailed, 35 were returned by the post office marked "not deliverable." There were 134 completed questionnaires returned that included performance information, for an effective response rate
of 35 percent. Questionnaires requesting supporting performance data were mailed independently to individuals listed as vice-presidents in each of the firms. Complete matching firm performance data were returned for 38 of the firms.
Respondents. The respondents were 92 percent male and 96 percent Caucasian. Eighty-five
percent were married. Education levels were above average for Utah, with 88 percent having at
least some college and 47 percent holding at least a bachelor's degree. Ages ranged from 25 to
65 with a mean of 43 years. Founders reported working a mean of 53 hours per week and had
been intensively involved in a median of one previous business start-up.
Finns. Completed questionnaires were returned for 134 manufacturing and service firms.
The manufacturing firms (45 percent of the sample) represented both low-technology and hightechnology industries, with a variety of products ranging from ceramic pottery, upholstered furniture, and animal kennels, to medical devices, electronic instruments, and ion lasers. The service firms included retailers (20 percent), wholesalers, (14 percent) and business services, (21
percent). The firms reported median sales of $100,000 to $500,000 and median sales growth of
15 percent to 19 percent. Median earnings, including the salary of the founder, ranged from
$50,000 to $100,000. The median number of employees was six. Although the data came from
businesses incorporating between 1985 and 1988, 32 of the 134 companies reported that they
were in business before 1985. Nineteen companies had been in business between six and 10
years; the remaining 13 companies had been in business from 11 to 25 years.

Measures
In past research business similarity has been operationalized as the degree of similarity
between the product or service offered by the pre-ownership business and the product or service
offered by the emerging business (Dunkelberg et al., 1987). Cooper et al. (1994) operationalized
business similarity as the similarity of services, customers, and suppliers. These approaches are
consistent with my conceptualization of task environment similarity. The present research has
extended the construct of business similarity and operationalized measures of skills/abilities
similarity, consistent with the concept of competencies as suggested by Chandler and Jansen

Task environment and skills/abilities similarity. The measures of task environment and
skills/abilities similarity are founders' self-reported perceptions of the degree of similarity
between their pre-ownership experience and the current venture. Eounders were asked to rate the
similarity of several items on 5-point scales (1 very dissimilar, 5 very similar). Based on the discussion earlier in this paper, two a priori dimensions were hypothesized.
56

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->(1) The first group of measures operationalized context issues. It is referred to as task
environment similarity, and incorporates the similarity of customers, suppliers,
competitors, product/service, and technology.
(2) The second construct is referred to as skills/abilities similarity and incorporates
content issues including tasks performed, knowledge, skills, and abilities required, managerial duties, and technical-functional duties.
Items as they appeared in the questionnaire and principal components analysis results using
a varimax rotation are displayed in Table 1. The results show that the business and task similarity dimensions factor as hypothesized. The first factor includes the work context items that I
refer to as task environment similarity. The similarity of technology loaded heavily on both
scales, and was thus omitted from the measure. Coefficient alpha for the remaining four-item
scale is .89 and does not improve if additional items are excluded from the analysis. The second
group of items comprises the job content items that we refer to as skills/abilities similarity.
Coefficient alpha for this four-item scale is .86 and does not improve if items are deleted from
the scale. The principal components and alpha analysis results provide evidence for the validity
and reliability of these constructs (Nunnally, 1978).
Control variables. Pre-ownership experience was measured by requesting the number of
years spent prior to founding the business as a general manager, managing their own business,
and in technical/specialist positions. Each of these was coded from zero to three: 0 = no prior
experience; 1 = some, but less than one year prior experience; 2 = one to three years prior experience; 3 = more than three years experience in this area. The areas were then summed to form
one variable that reflects both the depth and breadth of experience.
Business age was calculated by subtracting the year the business was founded from 1990,
the year the data were collected. Business types were coded using dummy variables; manufacturing, retail, and business services are entered into the regression equation to capture the variance accounted for by business type.
Finn level perfonnance indicators. This research focuses on two performance dimensions
that have been identified as being particularly releant to start-ups (Chandler & Hanks, 1993);
sales/earnings, and growth. Because most emerging businesses are privately held and have no
legally mandated requirement to disclose performance information, only self-report data were
available. Two items each are used to measure earnings and growth.
Principal components analysis with varimax rotation was used to investigate the structure
of measures of venture performance. Items used, descriptive statistics, and factor loadings of the
four items measuring firm performance are displayed in Table 2. Individual items measuring
each construct were combined to create two variables; sales/earnings, and growth. Coefficient
alpha for the sales/earnings variable is .76; coefficient alpha for the growth variable is .65. Both
approach or exceed the .70 recommended by Nunnally (1978).
All founders provided performance data; the subsample of 38 companies with two respondents was used to provide evidence of inter-rater reliability for performance measures. Interrater
reliability for the sales/earnings and growth variables are .83 and .73 (Pearson correlation coefficients) respectively (n = 38); there was substantial rater agreement on the pertbrmance measures.
Firm performance data were requested for the most recent three years for sales, earnings, and
sales growth. In the study, only the most recent year's figures were used. The correlation between
the most recent year and the year preceding were .86 for sales, .81 for earnings, and .79 for
growth. However, inter-rater reliabilities (Pearson correlation coefficients) for the previous year
were only .58 for sales/earnings and .45 for growth. The reliabilities for the second preceding
year were .42 for sales/earnings and .23 for growth. This suggests that self report measures of
performance are only reliable for the most recent year. Because of these results, the lack of reliability appears to be a greater concern than the concern for volatility, thus only the most recent
years figures were used. The content of the items and the statistical results provide evidence supporting the reliability and validity of the performance measures for the most recent year.

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
Descriptive statistics and simple correlations are displayed in Table 3. The correlations
between independent variables are relatively small, indicating there should be no serious problems due to multi-collinearity.
58

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->The univariate tests of significance displayed in the correlation matrix in Table 3 indicate that
experience is positively related to sales/earnings. Task environment similarity is positively related to venture growth. However, skills/abilities similarity is negatively related to sales/earnings.

Hypothesis 1
As previously discussed in the measurement section, the principal components results support the hypothesis that there are two separate dimensions of the knowledge, skills, and abilities
gained through experience. The items dealing with task environment issues load heavily on the
first factor, while items dealing with specific skills and abilities load heavily on the second factor. The pattern of factor analysis results supports the operationalization of two dimensions as
used in this study.

Hypotheses 2 and 3
To test the second and third hypotheses, hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used.
The second hypothesis stated that significant relationships between task environment similarity
and venture performance was expected. As can be seen in the upper half of Table 4, the hypothesis was supported when growth is the dependent variable (p < .05). There was no significant
relationship between task environment similarity and sales/earnings.
The third hypothesis stated the expectation of positive relationships between skills/abilities
similarity and venture performance. In the case of growth there is no significant relationship;
however, in the case of earnings the relationship is negative. This is contrary to the hypothesis.
The implications of these findings will be discussed later.

Hypotheses 4 and 5
The tlnal hypotheses stated that it was expected that task environment similarity and
skills/abilities similarity would moderate the relationship between experience and pertbrmance.
To test moderation effects it is appropriate to use complementary moderated regression analysis

Since entering three offour variables into the equation accounts for all variance due to business type {the fourth is a
linear combination of the first three, and will not enter a regression equation), only manufacturing, wholesale, and
retail were entered into subsequent analysis.

(Venkatraman, 1989). To model moderation the two original variables are entered into a regression equation (in this case experience and skills/abilities similarity) to predict an outcome variable (in this case sales/eamings and growth). The same variables are then multiplied together and
entered into the equation after the original variables are entered. If there is a significant interaction between the two original variables such that jointly they explain more variance than they do
separately, the multiplicative term will be statistically significant. This perspective can be represented in the following two equations:
= aO
Y = aO + a | X -t-a^Z + a3XZ + e

(1)
(2)

This multiplicative effect sometimes results in high levels of multicollinearity. However,
Southwood (1978) demonstrated that a simple scale of origin transformation reduces multicollinearity and the transformed multiplicative interaction remains a valid analytical tool for
60

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 10----->testing moderation. After the transformation, the t-score associated with a3 is a valid estimator
of the significance of the interaction term (Venkatraman, 1989). In all cases business age and
business type are entered into the equations to partially control for differences in performance
based on the age and stage of development of the firm and industry differences. The top half of
Table 4 summarizes the results of the multiple regression analysis.
The fourth hypothesis was that task environment similarity would be a positive moderator
of the relationship between experience and venture pertbrmance. Growth and sales/eainings are
the two dependent measures of venture performance. Business age and three categorical business-type variables are entered into the equations first. These are followed by experience and
task environment similarity. Finally, the multiplicative interaction term is entered into the equation. Although task environment similarity is significant as a direct independent variable with
respect to growth, there are no significant interaction effects. Equation II and Equation IV show
the results for Sales/Eamings and Growth respectively.
The final hypothesis was that skills/abilities similarity would be a positive moderator of
venture performance. This was tested in a similar manner as was the fourth hypothesis. The control variables were entered first, experience was allowed to enter the equation, followed by
skills/abilities similarity. The interaction of skills/abilities similarity is negative, and significantly so in the case of sales/earnings (p < .05). Equation I and Equation III include the results
for sales/earnings and growth respectively. These results are contrary to our hypothesis.

DISCUSSION
Although not the direct object of this study, some ancillary results in this study confirm previous research findings. The breadth and depth of experience gained by years spent in technical
and managerial positions appear to be positively related to sales/earnings (Dunkelberg &
Cooper, 1982; Dunkelberg et al., 1987; Stuart & Abetti, 1987, 1990).

Task Environment Similarity.
In general, task environment similarity appears to be positively related to firm performance;
the strongest effects are evidenced in terms of venture growth. This is congruent with previous
research findings (e.g.. Cooper et al, 1994; Dunkelberg et al; 1987). It is intuitively and theoretically reasonable that this should be the case. The overall results suggest that familiarity with the
task environment is an important correlate of new venture performance.
These results are supportive of the statement by Cooper et al. (1994) that the similarity of
the task environment implies knowledge of the task environment. The relative weakness of the
interaction term suggests that the major benefits of task environment exposure are captured by
the task environment similarity measure; there is no significant interaction between experience
and task similarity that explains more than the original variables.
An underlying implication of this finding is that it may not be necessary to have experience
in a highly similar business to gain familiarity with the task environment. In the 10 interviews,
I found six high-tech start-ups in which the pre-ownership experience was scientific research.
These founders perceived a need for a product that could be used in their research that was not
readily available on the market, or whose quality was previously inadequate. They were well
acquainted with the research community and knew other potential customers. They knew about
potential competitors because they had been suppliers of matenals used in the research. Another
founder of a highly successful plastic injection molding business was a tool and die maker, supplying injection dies to molding companies. He learned about the industry through contact with
his customers. He learned about potential margins, met suppliers, and came into contact with
customers for plastic injection molded parts as he designed dies to meet their needs.
Both the quantitative and anecdotal evidence associated with this study suggest that experience in and familiarity with the task environment is important. Among the 10 in depth interviewees only two came from a business with a highly similar product and started a business

that familiarity either by being potential customers of the product they developed or suppliers to
companies producing products similar to those produced by the new venture after start-up.

Skill/Ability Similarity
According to the research model, skills/abilities similarity should be a positive moderator
of the relationship between experience and performance. However, in the case of skill/ability
similarity and sales/earnings the interaction term is significantly negative. This finding is contrary to expectations. Theoretically, both task environment similarity and skills/abilities similarity should be positively related to venture performance. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that many of the perceived skills and abilities learned through prior experience were
learned incorrectly. In spite of this possibility, I attempted to better understand these findings by
pursuing post hoc analyses. First, I plotted the regression residuals against the predicted values
for the interaction term. In the case of skills/abilities similarity and both sales/earnings and
growth, the patterns indicated that the residuals were not uniformly distributed. The observed

and Watson (1986) to fit a quadratic regression model to the data according to the following
equation:
a2x2 + e

(3)

The results are displayed in the bottom half of Table 4 and Figure 2. The significance of the
curvilinear relationship is evaluated with an F-test of the partial regression equation . This test
is significant for the cur^'ilinear skills/abilities interaction term with both sales/earnings and
growth .
Taken in concert, the results suggest that the acquisition of a broad variety of managerial
and technical skills is beneficial to both the sales/earnings and growth of a new venture.
Founders need a broad mix of skills and abilities that will enable flexibility and creativity. This
is important because in the context of an emerging business, the specific role demands of the
founder may be different from the role expectations in previous experience. The curvilinear
nature of the relationship suggests that a moderate level of skills and similarity is optimal. A low
experience and similarity interaction suggests inadequate acquisition and transfer of skills and
abilities. On the other hand, a high experience and similarity interaction indicates that the
founder may be inappropriately performing the same tasks in the new venture as were performed
in previous businesses and suggests that entrenchment in specific job behaviors affects firm
performance negatively.
Through follow-up interviews, I became aware of occurrences that may help to explain this
phenomenon. In one case, an electrical engineer teamed with an individual with extensive marketing experience in the industry to start a company that produced a data logging device. The
marketer became a blocker of technological advances because that was not the way he perceived
it should be done in the industry. Growth and earnings were inhibited for a substantial period of
time until the marketer left the company and another individual with more flexibility was hired.
In another case, a second-time founder with extensive industry experience tried to apply the
same "formula" that made the first business successful to a new business 20 years later. The second business has struggled and appears to be on the brink of death. He told me "I don't understand it, I'm doing the same things that made my first business succeed."
The combined quantitative and anecdotal evidence suggests that a broad variety of skills
and abilities is good and those skills and abilities have a positive relationship with firm performance to a certain point. However, when founders eschew flexibility and innovation, and rigidly perform the same tasks as were performed in previous settings the results become negative.

IMPLICATIONS
This research provides significant insights into the dynamics associated with the relationship between pre-ownership experience and new venture performance. I believe that it provides
plausible explanations for why previous research analyzing these relationships have at times
been contradictory. For potential founders the results suggest that familiarity with the task environment is important. The results highlight the importance of the acquisition of a broad range of
skills and abilities that can be used flexibly in the emerging business. The results also indicate
that relying excessively on specific skills, abilities, and ways of doing things that were learned
previously can be associated with negative performance results.
The research has some inherent limitations. The cross-sectional design captures associations
between perceived task environment and skills/abilities similarity and firm performance, even
after the effects of business age, business type, and years of experience variables are accounted
for; however, the evidence is correlational rather than causal. In addition to the limitations
imposed by cross-sectional data, there may be some self-selection bias among those who chose

<-----Page 13----->to return the questionnaire. Also, the sample frame comprised a limited geographic area (Utah).
The research also may be affected by restriction of range, which means that the relationships
might be stronger if the sample included founders whose businesses failed. Finally, only a small
part of the total variance in venture performance appears to be explained by biographical measures of founder experience. Therefore, more research emphasis should be placed on the development of a comprehensive multilevel model of venture performance that incorporates, but does
not rely exclusively on, individual-level variables.
In spite of the limitations, the findings have some interesting implications. First, the findings imply that the distinction between task environment and skills/abilities similarity is important. Working in the task environment provides founders with important exposure to information. Although the acquisition of broad skills and abilities is important, the research suggests that
founders should be especially careful to guard against entrenchment in specific skills and abilities. Thus, the distinction between the two dimensions, task environment similarity and
skills/abilities similarity, should be preserved.
Most of the studies related to experience and performance have relied on biographical measures, such as years of experience, as indicators of learning. Although objectively measured, this
is at best a crude indicator of knowledge, skills, and abilities. In the area of personnel selection
a number of different tools have been developed to help assess the skills and abilities of potential employees. Paper-and-pencil skills tests have been developed that are relatively successful.
In addition such methods as assessment centers have been developed that require candidates to
participate in a number of different managerial tasks on which they are evaluated by a panel of
experts. Likewise, in-depth behavioral interviewing can give information not only about the
time spent in particular pursuits, but also the skills and abilities learned and the accomplishments
made. Particular insights could be gained if a panel of potential founders were evaluated and
then reevaluated at several subsequent times to track the acquisition and transfer of knowledge,
skills, and abilities. In addition, future studies might develop and operationalize measures of role
flexibility or adaptability (or alternatively inflexibility and entrenchment). In conclusion, the
present study highlights some of the complexities associated with the acquisition and transfer of
learning that can enhance venture performance. There is substantial room in the field for additional studies that will move beyond years of experience as a performance indicator and focus
on the process of acquiring and successfully using individual and organizational competencies.
