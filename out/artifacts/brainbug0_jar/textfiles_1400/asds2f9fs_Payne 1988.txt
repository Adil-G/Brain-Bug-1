The role ofeffort and accuracy in the adaptive use of decision processes is examined. A computer
simulation using the concept of elementary information processes identified heuristic choice
strategies that approximate the accuracy of normative procedures while saving substantial effort.
However, no single heuristic did well across all task and context conditions. Of particular interest
was the finding that under time constraints, several heuristics were more accurate than a truncated
normative procedure. Using a process-tracing technique that monitors information acquisition
behaviors, two experiments tested how closely the efficient processing patterns for a given
decision problem identified by the simulation correspond to the actual processing behavior
exhibited by subjects. People appear highly adaptive in responding to changes in the structure of
the available alternatives and to the presence of time pressure. In general, actual behavior
corresponded to the general patterns of efficient processing identified by the simulation. Finally,
learning of effort and accuracy trade-offs are discussed.

benefit perspective provides the potential for explaining why
decision strategies vary across situations.
This article examines the adaptive selection of choice strategies and is structured as follows: First, a framework for
measuring both the cognitive effort and accuracy of different
strategiesin various decision environments is presented. That
framework decomposes choice strategies into a common set
of more elementary information processes (EIPs). Next, a
Monte-Carlo simulation of the effort and accuracy of choice
strategies in a variety of choice environments is reported and
the impact of time constraints on the relative accuracy of
decision strategies is examined. The simulation identifies
general patterns of adaptivity in processing that might be
expected if the effort and accuracy framework is correct and
is used to hypothesize patterns of context and task effects for
a particular decision environment. Two experimental studies
are then reported that examine the correspondence between
the patterns identified by the simulation and actual behavior.

A major empirical finding of recent decision research is
that individuals use a variety of choice strategies (Abelson &
Levi, 1985). Sometimes a person will use a compensatory
strategy that processes all relevant information and trades off
the good and bad aspects of each alternative. At other times,
the same person might use a noncompensatory decision strategy, which avoids trade-offs among values and typically reduces information processing demands by ignoring potentially relevant problem information. For example, the lexicographic strategy simply selects the alternative that is best
on the most important attribute if there are no ties. The use
of a particular decision strategy is contingent on many task
and context variables (Payne, 1982), such as the number of
alternatives.
Evidence of contingent information processing in decisions
raises an important question: Why are certain decision strategies applied to certain decision problems? One general perspective looks at strategy selection as a function of both costs,
primarily the effort required to use a rule, and benefits,
primarily the ability of a strategy to select the best alternative
(Beach & Mitchell, 1978; Russo & Dosher, 1983). A costbenefit approach to strategy selection maintains the concept
of calculated rationality (March, 1978) by including the costs
of executing the decision process in the assessment of rationality. Furthermore, because the costs and benefits of various
decision strategies vary across different problems, the cost-

Effort and Accuracy in Choice
One major difficulty in using a cost-benefit perspective to
examine strategy selection has been the lack of an easily
calculated and conceptually appropriate measure of effort. A
second area of concern has been the lack of agreement on
how to measure choice accuracy.

Measuring Strategy Effort
Building on ideas of Newell and Simon (1972), Johnson
and Payne (1985) suggested that decision strategies can be
decomposed into EIPs. A decision strategy can then be seen
as a sequence of events, such as reading the values of two
alternatives on an attribute, comparing them, and so forth.

<-----Page 1----->ADAPTIVE DECISIONS

One set of EIPs for decision making follows: (a) read an
alternative's value on an attribute into short-term memory
(STM), (b) compare two alternatives on an attribute, (c) add
the values of two attributes in STM, (d) calculate the size of
the difference of two alternatives for an attribute, (e) weight
one value by another (product), (f) eliminate an alternative
from consideration, (g) move to next element of the external
environment, and, (h) choose the preferred alternative and
end the process. Such EIPs provide a common language for
describing seemingly diverse decision strategies in terms of
their underlying components. This is important if strategy
selection is to be investigated at an information processing
level rather than at a more general level of analysis, such as
analytic versus nonanalytic (Beach & Mitchell, 1978) or analytic versus intuitive (Hammond, 1986). The EIPs can also
be used as components in production system models of decision strategies (see Johnson & Payne, 1985, for an example).
Productions are condition _ action pairs, where the action is
performed only if the condition is matched. The EIPs could
be used as the actions, and the results of earlier actions could
be used as parts of conditions (e.g., if A and B have been read,
then add A and B).
A particular set of EIPs represents a theoretical judgment
regarding the appropriate level of decomposition for decision
processes. For instance, the product operator might itself be
decomposed into more elementary processes. We hypothesize,
however, that a reasonable approximation of the cognitive
effort associated with a strategy may be obtained from the
foregoing level of decomposition.
A count of the total number ofEIPs used by a given strategy
to reach a decision in a particular choice environment provides a measure of the effort associated with the use of that
decision strategy in that environment (0. Huber, 1980; Johnson, 1979). A number of studies of cognition use EIP counts
to measure processing load (e.g., Card, Moran, & Newell,
1983). A study that directly relates EIP counts to measures of
decision effort is described in Bettman, Johnson, and Payne
(1987).

MeasuringAccuracy
Accuracy of choice can be defined in many ways. Quality
of choice can be defined by basic principles of coherence such
as not selecting dominated alternatives or not displaying
intransitive patterns of preferences. Note that violations of
dominance can be defined in terms ofa single choice, whereas
violations oftransitivityare defined over several choices. More
specific criteria for decision quality can be developed in
certain types of choice environments. For instance, the expected utility (EU) model is often suggested as a normative
decision procedure for risky choice because it can be derived
from more basic principles. A special case of the EU model,
the maximization of expected value (EV), has been used as a
criterion to investigate the accuracy of decision heuristics via
computer simulation (Thorngate, 1980; Johnson & Payne,
1985). The main advantage of EV as an accuracy measure is
that utility values from individual decision makers are not
required to operationalize the rule. A similar model, the

535

compensatory weighted additive rule, is often used as a criterion for decision effectivenessin multiattribute choice (Zakay
& Wooler, 1984).

A Monte-Carlo Simulation Study of Effort and
Accuracy in Choice
This study provides predictions about the patterns of processing that would be exhibited in various task environments
by an idealized adaptive decision maker attending to both
effort and accuracy in selecting a decision strategy. The simulation was used to generate hypotheses about the types of
processing that might occur in the experiments described
below if decision makers adapt to different task environments
as predicted by the proposed framework.
The simulation extends prior work reported in Johnson
and Payne's (1985) article. In particular, the present study
investigates environments with time constraints, potentially
one of the most significant task variables. Under time constraints, heuristics might be even more accurate than a "normative" strategy such as maximization of expected value,
because the heuristic's accuracy may degrade under increasing
time pressure at a slower rate than a more comprehensive
processing rule (e.g., EV) degrades. One reason for this is that
heuristics require fewer operations and will generally be "further along" when time runs out. Furthermore, people may
use heuristics under time pressure because they have no other
choice (Simon, 1981). A more normative decision strategy
like expected utility maximization may exceed the information processing capabilities of a decision maker, given any
"reasonable" time limit. Deciding how to choose then becomes a selection of the "best" of the available heuristics, not
a choice between using some heuristic or the more normative
rule.

Choice Environmentand Processing Characteristics
The decision task used in the simulation study and in the
empirical studies was a special type of risky choice, with
alternatives with outcomes that have different payoffs but the
same probability for each alternative. In other words, each of
the alternatives may have a different value for a given outcome, but the probability of receiving that outcome is the
same for all the alternatives. This allows the decision task to
be interpreted as either a riskless choice or as a form of risky
choice (Keeney & Raiffa, 1976).In the risklessinterpretations,
the probabilities function as attribute weightsthat apply across
alternatives. One can look at a probability of .20, for example,
as the weight given to a particular attribute across all alternatives. Note that a statement about structural similarity is
all that is being claimed; the empirical work described later
used the risky choice interpretation.
In solving risky choice problems, the decision maker must
search among probabilities and the values associated with the
outcomes for each alternative. Different decision strategies
can be thought of as different rules for conducting that search
and vary in a number of aspects (see Bettman, 1979). One of
the most important distinctions among rules is the extent of
compensatory as compared to noncompensatory processing.

<-----Page 2----->536

J. PAYNE, J. BEITMAN, AND E. JOHNSON

A related aspect is the degree to which the amount of processing is consistent (or selective) across alternatives or attributes. That is, is the same amount of information examined
for each alternative or attribute, or does the amount vary? In
general, it has been assumed that more consistent processing
across alternatives is indicative of a more compensatory decision strategy (Payne, 1976). Consistent processing sometimes involves examination of all information for every alternative and attribute. A more variable (selective) processing
pattern, on the other hand, is seen as indicating a strategy of
eliminating alternatives on the basis of only a partial processing of information, without considering whether additional
information might compensate for a poor value.
Another general processing characteristic is the total
amount of processing carried out. Whether processing is
consistent or not, the total amount of information examined
can vary, from quite cursory to exhaustive.
A final aspect of processing concerns whether the search
and evaluation of alternatives proceeds across or within attributes or dimensions. The former is often called wholistic or
alternative-based processing and the latter dimensional or
attribute-based processing. In alternative-based processing,
multiple attributes of a singlealternative are considered before
information about a second alternative is processed. In contrast, in attribute-based processing, the values of several alternatives on a single attribute are processed before information
about a second attribute is processed. Russo and Dosher
(1983) suggest that attribute-based processing is cognitively
easier.
The next section provides additional detail on the specific
strategiesused in the simulation. Followingthese descriptions,
we provide examples of how the specific strategies exemplify
the above distinctions.

Decision Strategies Examined
The simulation investigated 10 decision strategies. The 10
strategies were selected because they vary substantially in the
amount of information used and in the way that available
information is used to make a choice.
The most information intensive strategy examined was a
version of a weighted additive (w AOO) compensatory process,
which can be thought of as a version of expected value
maximization. The strategy considers the values of each alternative on all of the relevant attributes (outcomes) and all of
the relative importances (weights or probabilities) of the different attributes (outcomes) to the decision maker. The rule
develops a weighted value for each attribute by multiplying
the weight (probability) by the value and sums over all attributes to arrive at an overall evaluation of an alternative. The
rule selects the alternative with the highest evaluation. The
random (RAN) choice rule, in contrast, chooses an alternative
at random with no search of the available information, providing a minimum baseline for measuring both accuracy and
effort.
In addition to these two baseline rules, six choice heuristics
and two combination strategies were implemented. The equal
weight (EQW) rule examines all alternatives and all attribute

values for each alternative. However, the rule ignores information about the relative importance (probability) of each
attribute. In some contexts, the equal weight rule has been
advocated as a highly accurate simplification of the risky
choice process (Thorngate, 1980). Elimination by aspects
(EBA) (Tversky, 1972) begins by determining the most important attribute (the outcome with the highest weight [probability]). Then, the cutoff value for that attribute is retrieved, and
all alternatives with values for that attribute below the cutoff
are eliminated. The process continues with the second most
important attribute, then the third, and so on, until one
alternative remains.
The majority of confirming dimensions (MCO) rule (Russo
& Dosher, 1983)involves processingpairs of alternatives. The
values for each of the two alternatives are compared on each
attribute, and the alternative with a majority of winning
(better) attribute values is selected. In the case of an equal
number of winning values for the two alternatives, our version
of this rule retained the alternative winning the comparison
on the last attribute. The retained alternative is then compared
to the next alternative among the set of alternatives. The
process of pair-wise comparison repeats until all alternatives
have been evaluated and the final winning alternative identified. The satisficing (SAT) rule (Simon, 1955) considers alternatives one at a time, in the order they occur in the set. Each
attribute of an alternative is compared to a cutoff value. If
any attribute value is below the cutoff value, that alternative
is rejected. The first alternative which passes the cutoffs for
all attributes is chosen, so a choice can be made before all
alternatives have been evaluated. In the case where no alternative passes all the cutoffs, a random choice is made.
Two versions of the lexicographic choice rule were implemented. For the strict lexicographic (LEX) rule, the most
important attribute is determined, the values of all the alternatives on that attribute are examined, and the alternative
with the best value on that attribute is selected. If there are
ties, the second most important attribute is examined, and so
on, until the tie is broken. Because the simulation generates
attributes as continuous random variates, ties almost never
occur. A lexicographic semi-order (LEXSEMI) rule (Tversky,
1969) was also examined. This rule is similar to the strict
lexicographic rule, but introduces the notion of a just-noticeable difference (JNo). If several alternatives are within a JNO
of the best alternative on the most important attribute, they
are considered to be tied. The potential advantage of the
LEXSEMI rule is that it ensures that an option that is marginally
better on the most important attribute but much worse on
other attributes will not necessarilybe selected.
Finally, two combined strategies were implemented. The
first was an elimination-by-aspects plus weighted additive
(EBA+WAOO) rule. This rule used an EBA process until the
number of available alternatives remaining wasthree or fewer,
and then used a weighted additive rule to select among the
remaining alternatives. The other combined strategy, elimination-by-aspects plus majority of confirming dimensions
(EBA+MCO), used an elimination-by-aspects process to reduce
the problem size, and then used a majority of confirming
dimensions heuristic to select from the reduced set. These
combinations were used because they had been observed in

<-----Page 3----->ADAPTIVE DECISIONS

several previous choice process studies (e.g., Bettman & Park,
1980).
As noted earlier, these choice strategies differ on a number
of aspects, such as the degree to which the amount of processing is consistent or variable across attributes or alternatives,
the pattern ofprocessing (alternative based or attribute based),
and the total amount of processing. The various strategies
represent different combinations of these aspects. The
weighted adding strategy uses consistent and alternative-based
processing and examines all available information. The equal
weight strategy uses consistent and alternative-based processing but uses a subset of the available information. The MCD
rule is consistent, attribute-based, and ignores weight information. The EBA rule implies a variable (selective) pattern of
processing that is attribute based. The total amount of information processed by EBA depends on the particular values of
the alternatives and cutoffs. The lexicographic strategies are
also selective and attribute based, and the satisficing strategy
is selective and alternative based. The total amount of information processed is also contingent upon the particular values
of the alternatives for these strategies.
The simulation provides insights into how aspects of processing, as exemplified by individual strategies, might change
across different choice environments if adaptivity is exhibited.
Other aspects of processing, such as the proportion of processing devoted to the probabilities and the proportion of
processing devoted to the most probable (important) attribute,
will also be considered.

Task and Context Variables
Three task variables were examined. The number of alternatives and number of attributes were each varied at three
levels (2, 5, and 8) in order to manipulate task complexity.
The third task variable included was time pressure, varied at
four levels. One level involved no time pressure, with each
rule using as many operations as needed. The three other
levels of time constraint were a maximum of (a) 50 EIPs
(severe time pressure), (b) 100 EIPs (moderate pressure), and
(c) 150 EIPs (low pressure). These time (EIP) constraint values
were selected on the basis of an analysis of the maximum
number of EIPs associated with the most effortful rule
(weighted additive).' Note that the total number of EIPs was
used to operationalize time pressure. This implicitly assumes
that each EIP takes a similar amount of time. The sensitivity
of the analyses to this assumption is examined later.
A key issue in dealing with the time constraints is how rules
should select among alternatives if they run out of time.
Several rules identify one alternative as the best seen so far
(i.e., the WADD, EQW, and MCD rules) and select that alternative when they run out of time. The EBA, LEX, and SAT rules
all pick an option randomly from those alternatives not yet
eliminated. Because the EBA and lexicographic rules were able
to process all alternatives on at least one attribute, even for
the largest problem size under the most severe time constraint,
the choice came from the set already processed but not
eliminated. For the SAT rule in this most severe case, if the
first alternative was not acceptable, then random choice
among the remaining alternatives seemed to be the most

537

reasonable option. For the two combined strategies, the selection was either made at random from the alternatives not yet
eliminated, if the combined strategy was still in the EBA phase,
or the best so far, if in the WADD or MCD phase.
Finally, two context variables were included. Context variables, unlike task variables, are associated with the particular
choice object values (Payne, 1982). One context variable was
the presence or absence of dominated alternatives. Removing
dominated alternatives produces efficient choice sets. MeClelland (1978) suggested that the success ofthe equal weighting simplification strategy is dependent on the presence of
dominated alternatives. Empirical evidence showing that
dominated alternatives can impact choice was provided by J.
Huber, Payne, and Puto (1982). This implies that dominated
alternatives are not simply disregarded.
The second context variable was the degree of dispersion
of probabilities within each gamble. To illustrate, a fouroutcome gamble with a low degree of dispersion might have
probabilities of .30, .20, .22, and .28 for the four outcomes,
respectively. On the other hand, a gamble with a high degree
of dispersion might have probabilities such as .68, .12, .05,
and .15 for the four outcomes. This variable was chosen
because Thorngate (1980) had suggested that probability information may be relatively unimportant in making accurate
risky choices (see also Beach, 1983). Obviously, if all of the
outcome probabilities were identical, probability information
would not matter. On the other hand, if one outcome is
certain, then examining the probability information to find
that outcome is crucial. What is unclear is how sensitive
heuristics are to the dispersion in probabilities, and how
adaptive actual behavior is to such a context variable. We
therefore examined decision sets with either low or high
dispersion.

JNDs and Cutoff Values
Three of the rules, EBA, SAT, and LEXSEMI, involve parameters that affect the potential effort and accuracy of the rules.
For EBA and SAT this is the cutoff value used to eliminate
alternatives. For the LEXSEMI rule, it is the value of the JND.
Although these parameters are, in some sense, under the
control of the decision maker for each decision, we wanted to
establish a priori values that would be the same for all decisions made by the simulation. A pilot simulation without any
time constraints was run to identify the best levels, with all
attributes in the simulation drawn from a uniform distribution bounded by 0 and 1,000. We manipulated both cutoffs
(100, 300, and 500) and JNDS (I, 50, and 100) and selected
values that represented the most efficient accuracy-effort
trade-offs averaged across the entire set ofdecisions. We found
that values of the cutoff of 500 and 300 were most efficient
for EBA and SAT, respectively, and that a JND of 50 gave the
best performance for the LEXSEMI rule. The results presented
I To provide insight into the ranges of values possible, the average
number of EIPs required for the weighted additive rule to run to
completion ranged from 28 for the two-alternative, two-attribute case
to 400 for the eight-alternative, eight-attribute case. Comparable
figures for the lexicographic strategy are 21.3 (2 x 2) and 172.5 (8 x

8).

Method
Each of the 10 decision rules was applied to 200 randomly generated decision problems in each of the 288 conditions defined by a 3
(number of alternatives) by 3 (number of attributes) by 2 (low or high
dispersion of probabilities or weights) by 2 (presence or absence of
dominated alternatives) by 2 (cutoff values) by 4 (time constraints)
factorial. After each trial, the alternative selected was recorded, along
with a tally for each elementary operation used by the decision rule.

Results
Effort was measured using EIPs, and accuracy was measured using EV (WADD) maximization. Specifically, effort was
measured by the total count of the EIPs used by a specific
decision rule to make a selection from a particular set of
alternatives. This measure assumes that each EIP requires the
same level of time or mental effort. Later, we report results
that relax that assumption.
The sv-based measure of accuracy compared the relative
performance of strategies to the two baseline strategies: (a) the

EVheuristic rule choice -

EVexpected

value choice -

EVrandom rule choice

EVrandom

rule choice

The maximum expected value possible in a particular choice
set and the expected value associated with a random selection
were determined. The expected value of the alternative selected by a decision heuristic was then compared to these two
baseline values. This measure is bounded by a value of 1.00
for the EV rule, and an expected value of 0.0 for random
selection. It provides a measure of the relative improvement
of a heuristic strategy over random choice. Although this
measure ofaccuracy may seem somewhat arbitrary, the results
are not sensitive to the use of alternative criteria (see Johnson
& Payne, 1985, for a discussion of other accuracy measures).
Table I presents the relative accuracy and effort scores for
each of the 10 decision strategies in each of the four cells
defined by crossing the context factors dispersion in weights
(low, high) and dominance (present or absent). These scores
are for the no-time-pressure conditions. The results are averaged over number of alternatives and number of attributes.
Note that the aspects characterizing each strategy are also
included to aid interpretation of the results.

No-time-pressure results. The simulation results indicate
that in some environments, heuristics can approximate the
accuracy of a normative strategy (WADD), with substantial
savings in effort. A decision maker using an EQW model, for
example, can achieve 89% of the relative performance of the
normative model, with only about half the effort, in the lowdispersion, dominance-possible task environment. Even more
impressive is the performance of the strict lexicographic rule
in the high-dispersion task environments. The lexicographic
rule achieves 90% relative accuracy, with only about 40% of
the effort. Note that the performance of the lexicographicsemiorder rule exceeds that of the simpler lexicographic rule
in only one of the four decision environments. The extra
effort needed to use JNDS may only be of value in a limited
set of situations.
It is clear from Table 1 that the most efficient heuristic
varies across decision environments. In the low-dispersion,
dominance-possible environment, for example, the processing
simplification of ignoring probability (weight) information,
that is, the equal weight strategy, appears quite accurate. In
contrast, when the dispersion in probabilities is higher, the
lexicographic rule, which ignores all the payoff information
except that associated with the single most likely outcome, is
the most accurate heuristic, and is substantially better than
the equal weight rule. It is also clear that some heuristics (e.g.,
MCD and SAT) perform reasonably in the dominance-possible
environments, but are very poor performers when all dominated alternatives have been removed. Note also that in the
low-dispersion, dominance-absent environment, the best simple heuristic, LEX, has an accuracy score of .67. That accuracy
score is .22 less than the accuracy score for the "best" heuristic
in the other three environments. This suggeststhat a decision
maker in such an environment would not be able to reduce
effort much without suffering a substantial loss in accuracy.
Decision problems involving low dispersion, dominance-absent environments may therefore be particularly difficult.
In summary, heuristic strategies can be highly accurate in
some environments, but no single heuristic does well across
all contexts. This suggests that if a decision maker wanted to
achieve both a reasonably high level of accuracy and low
effort, he or she would have to use a repertoire of strategies,
with selection contingent upon situational demands.
An interesting set of results from Table 1 concerns the
performance of the two combined decision strategies. The
combination of an elimination process with a weighted adding
model (EBA + W ADD) performed well across all task conditions.
That rule offers a good combination of expected accuracy and
reasonable levels of expected effort. The EBA+MCD rule, on
the other hand, seems to be an inefficient combination strategy.
Although it is not shown in Table 1, there were systematic
effects of the task variables number of alternatives and number of attributes. For example, the mean accuracy of the equal
weight rule decreased only from .93 to .87 as the number of
attributes increased from two to eight in the low-dispersion,
dominance-possible environment. However, the mean accuracy of the LEX rule did decrease substantially, from .86 to
.55, as the number of attributes was increased. The decrease
in accuracy for the lexicographic rule reflects the fact that a
rule that uses only information associated with a single (al-

539

though the most probable) outcome would be expected to
perform worse as an increasing number of relatively important (probable) outcomes are ignored. In contrast, the impact
of increases in number of attributes on the EQW and LEX rules
was reversed for the high-dispersion, dominance-possible environments. The mean accuracy for the EQW rule decreased
from .71 to .49 for the two outcome and eight outcome
problems, respectively, reflecting the fact that the rule essentially overweightsinformation from more and more outcomes
with small probabilities as the number of outcomes is increased. The LEX rule decreased only from .93 to .87 for the
same problems.
The number of alternatives also had effects on effort. For
instance, an increase in the number of alternatives from two
to eight increased the average EIP count of the weighted
adding rule by 191 EIPs. The EBA strategy, on the other hand,
only increased by 79 EIPs as the number of alternatives went
from two to eight. More generally, the effort required to use
heuristics increased more slowly than the effort required to
use more normative procedures as the number of alternatives
was increased. This simulation result is compatible with prior
empirical work showing shifts in strategies due to number of
alternatives (Payne, 1982).
The potential trade-offs between accuracy and effort for the
different strategies are highlighted by Figure I, which shows
the results from the low-dispersion in probabilities (weights),
dominance possible and high-dispersion, dominance-possible
contexts averaged over number of alternatives and outcomes.
Only the dominance-possible context is shown because it is
used in the experimental work described later. The measure
of effort for each strategy has been turned into a relative
measure based on the ratio of the number of EIPs required
by a heuristic to the number of EIPs required by the most
effortful WADD strategy. A line that indicates an efficient
frontier of strategies, considering both a desire for greater
accuracy and a desire for lesser effort, is drawn for each
context. Figure I makes clear both the existence of efficient
heuristics and the fact that the accuracy/effort trade-offs for
various strategies differ across relatively subtle changes in
context, such as the dispersion in probabilities.
The simulation does not identify which particular strategy
a decision maker will necessarily select in a given decision
environment. That would depend on the degree to which a
decision maker was willing to trade decreases in accuracy for
effort savings. However, note that if a decision maker desired
relatively high levels of accuracy in an environment where
dominance is possible, there are accurate strategies in each
environment with substantial savings in effort: the LEX rule
in the high-dispersion condition and the EQW strategy in the
low-dispersion condition. Thus, the simulation predicts that
when dominance is possible, one should see more processing
consistent with a LEX strategy (e.g., attribute-based processing,
selective processing across attributes, and higher proportions
of processing on probabilities and the most important attribute) in environments with high-dispersion in probabilities.
In contrast, in low-dispersion environments, one should observe more alternative-based processing, more consistent
processing, and a lower proportion of processing of probabilities and the most important attribute, consistent with strategies like the EQW rule. The prediction is based on the assump-

tion that people are sensitive to the relative accuracy ofstrategies in different contexts, as well as being aware of differences
in relative effort.
In addition to this prediction, a more subtle prediction can
also be made. Note that if one uses the equal weight strategy
in a low-dispersion environment and the LEX strategy under
high dispersion, roughly equal accuracy can be attained. However, lesseffort is required in the high-dispersion environment.
Thus, if subjects desire relatively high levels of accuracy, the
simulation would predict that accuracy levels would not vary

across dispersion conditions, but that effort levels would be
lower for the high-dispersion condition.
The simulation results discussed so far have assumed as a
first approximation that all EIPs require an equal amount of
effort to execute. Prior work by Johnson and Payne (1985)
suggested that such an assumption was sufficient for the
simplified decision tasks they studied. However, it does seem
reasonable that some EIPs may take more time to execute, or
be more effortful, than others. In another study, Bettman et
al. (1987) used counts of elementary operations (EIPs) to

predict measures of decision effort such as the total time
required to make a decision. The counts of EIPs required by
a specific strategy for a specific decision problem provided an
excellent (R 2 = .81) prediction of overall decision latencies.
Consequently, estimates of the times associated with the EIPs
obtained by Bettman et al. were used to see if the trade-offs
between accuracy and effort for the different strategies examined in the present study would change. The major result
was that all the heuristics become relatively less effortful when
the individual EIPs are weighted. However, the aforementioned key relations between aspects of processing and the
context variable of low and high dispersion are essentially
unchanged when weighted effort counts were used in place of
the equal weighted assumption. The relative performance of
the various strategies was almost identical.
Time pressure results. The time pressure results are shown
in Table 2. Time constraints clearly have differential effects
on the various rules. The W ADD rule, for example, shows a
marked reduction in accuracy from the baseline value of 1.0
under no time pressure to an average accuracy of only .12
under the most severe time constraint in the no-dominance,
low-dispersion condition. In contrast, the EBA heuristic shows
relatively little effect of time pressure. The average accuracy
across environments is reduced only from .69 with no time
pressure to .56 under severe time pressure. Interestingly, the
EBA rule is actually the most accurate decision strategy in
three of the four environments for severe time pressure. The
LEX rule also holds up well under time pressure. It appears
that strategies involving an initial processing of all alternatives
using a limited set of attributes do well under severe time
pressure. On the basis of the simulations, it seems important
under high time pressure to use a choice strategy that processes
at least some information about all alternatives as soon as
possible. However, note that in one decision environment
(dominance possible, low dispersion in weights), the alternative simplification strategy provided by the equal weight rule
is superior for even the most severe time constraint studied.

Implications ofthe Simulation
The simulation results indicate what a decision maker
might do to adapt to various decision environments. The
results clearly suggest the possibility that a decision maker
might maintain a high level of accuracy and minimize effort
by using a diverse set of heuristics, changing rules as contexts
and time pressures change.
Obviously, the simulation results have to be interpreted
with some caution. Although the results appear to be robust,
both the measures of effort and the measures of accuracy
represent approximations. In addition, it is unlikely that
actual choice behavior involves a straightforward execution
of one choice strategy or another. As noted earlier, there is
evidence for mixtures of strategies being used (Payne, 1976).
The strategies represented in the simulation should be viewed
as prototypical strategies that can be used to hypothesize how
the form of information processing in decision making may
shift as a function of task and context demands.
Despite these limitations, the simulation work provides
insights into how processing might change if efficient accuracy-effort trade-offs were desired. The simulation results for

541

the context variable, dispersion in probabilities, suggest that
when dominated alternatives are possible, more attributebased processing, more selective processing across attributes
and alternatives, and a higher proportion of processing on
probabilities and the most important attribute should be
observed in the high-dispersion rather than in the low-dispersion condition. Such aspects characterize rules, like the LEX
rules, that are relatively accurate with substantial effort savings
in the high-dispersion environment. In addition, it was noted
earlier that individuals should be able to attain similar levels
of accuracy in both low- and high-dispersion environments,
but they should be able to do so with less effort in the highdispersion setting.
The simulation also suggests that strategies characterized
by attribute-based processing and selectivity in processing,
particularly across attributes, should be more effective under
severe time pressure. Strategies such as LEX and EBA, which
maintain accuracy relatively well under heavy time pressure,
also are characterized by a greater proportion of processing
on probabilities and the most important attribute.
The foregoing simulation work could be validated in several
ways. One method, used in Bettman et al. (1987), as noted
earlier, is to show that counts of the elementary operations
generated by the simulation could be used to predict effortrelated behaviors such as the total time required to make a
decision or self-reports of cognitive effort. Another approach
to validation would be to show that adaptivity in information
processing shown by human decision makers, when free to
select any strategy, was in the general directions predicted by
the simulation. The next two experiments take this second
approach to validation and investigate the adaptivity of processing when actual decision behavior is examined.

Empirical Investigations: An Overview
The following experiments examine the degree of correspondence between the actual adaptivity shown by human
decision makers and the adaptive processing patterns (strategies)implied by the simulation results. Specifically, we ask (a)
to what extent do people vary their information processing
behavior as a function of context effectssuch as the dispersion
of probabilities and task effects such as time pressure?; and
(b) are these changes in processing in the directions suggested
by the simulation? One important feature of these experiments is the use of a complete within-subjects design. Such a
design provides a strong test of adaptivity, because the subject
would be expected to switch strategies from one trial to the
next.
As outlined earlier the simulation results provide a fairly
clear picture of an adaptive decision maker. If decision makers
adapt as suggested by the simulation, there should be a
relation between the dispersion of probabilities and various
aspects of processing. In particular, more attribute-based processing, greater selectivity in processing across attributes and
alternatives, and a greater proportion of processing devoted
to probabilities and the most important attribute are expected
in a high-dispersion environment. Such shifts in processing
as a function of context would indicate that people are sensitive to changes in choice environments that affect the accuracy
of strategies and not just to changes that affect processing

<-----Page 8----->542

demands. The reason is that the relative accuracy of rules
varies across contexts (dispersion conditions), but the relative
effort required by the rules does not. Studies showing contingent processing due to task complexity (e.g., changes in numbers of alternatives and attributes) are fairly common (see
Payne, 1982); studies showing processing changes due to
context variables, and hence implicitly some concern for
accuracy, are much less common (however, see Busemeyer,
1985; Russo & Dosher, 1983).
The task variable examined is the presence or absence of
time pressure. The simulation results also indicate changes in
aspects of processing under severe levels of time pressure. In
particular, more attribute-based processing, greater selectivity
in processing, and a greater proportion of processing focused
on probabilities and the most important attribute might be
expected.
Other work on time pressure reinforces these predictions.
For example, Ben Zur and Breznitz (1981) identified at least
three ways in which people may respond to time constraints.
One way to cope with time pressure is to process only a subset
of the most important information, an idea referred to as
"filtration" (Miller, 1960). Another way to cope with time
pressure is to "accelerate" processing (Ben Zur & Breznitz,
1981; Miller, 1960) by trying to process the same information
at a faster rate. Finally, one could shift processing strategies.
At the extreme, this could involve random choice, or "avoidance" (Ben Zur & Breznitz, 1981; Miller, 1960). A less extreme form of contingent processing would involve a shift
from a more effortful rule, such as the additive rule, to a less
effortful rule, like EBA. The simulation results indicate that
such a strategy shift could maintain relatively high levels of
accuracy, even under severe time pressure.
The hypothesis of filtration is supported in other studies.
For example, Wright (1974) reported that the most important
information in a judgment task was given more weight under
time pressure. Ben Zur and Breznitz (1981) reported shifting
to the use ofmore important information under time pressure.
Furthermore, Ben Zur and Breznitz also found that subjects
spent less time looking at individual items of information
under time pressure. They concluded that combining filtration and limited acceleration "can be viewed as the optimal
decision making strategy when the [decision maker] is confronted with information overload while pressured by deadlines" (p. 102). Note that filtration can be characterized by
greater selectivity across alternatives and attributes and by
greater emphasis on the most important attribute.
The foregoing hypotheses deal with processing information.
Accuracy under time pressure was addressed by Zakay and
Wooler (1984). They found that under time pressure a smaller
proportion of the observed choices consisted of the alternative
that had been measured as having the greatest additive value.
In sum, the simulation and prior empirical research lead to
several hypotheses. Both higher dispersion in probabilities
and higher time pressure are expected to lead to greater use
of attribute-based processing, greater selectivity across attributes and alternatives, and greater focus of processing on
probabilities and the most important attribute. In addition,
there should be no difference in accuracy for different levels
of dispersion, but there should be less effort under high

dispersion. Under high time pressure, accuracy should be
lower and information should be processed more rapidly.
These predictions could be derived in at least two ways.
One could assume that subjects have explicit accuracy and
effort feedback and make conscious trade-offs of accuracy
and effort. Alternatively, one can assume that subjects have
general knowledge of the properties of a reasonable strategy
and of task environments (e.g., see Reder, 1987). Then, in the
course ofmaking decisions, subjects generate processfeedback
(Anzai & Simon, 1979). That is, subjects can ascertain how
effortful their strategy was and how closely it resembled their
notion of what a "good" strategy should entail. Such process
feedback can be generated without explicit feedback about
outcomes. Subjects would then adapt based upon their general
knowledge and process feedback (Reder, 1987).
In the present article, the second mode of arriving at the
predictions was used. Subjects are assumed to have ideas
about the characteristics of reasonable strategies, to generate
process feedback, and to adapt by using the process feedback
and seeing how well their strategy as executed matches their
view of a "reasonable" strategy. In the experiments reported,
the choices are made without explicit feedback regarding
accuracy for two major reasons: (a) The majority of common
decision problems do not offer the opportunity to receive
immediate and clear feedback about the quality of choice
(Einhorn, 1980); (b) to the extent adaptivity is exhibited in
situations without explicit accuracy feedback, it provides
strong evidence for adaptive decision processing. That is, it
would suggest that adaptivity may be crucial enough to decision makers that they will guide themselves to it without the
need for an external prod in the form of explicit feedback.

Experiment 1
In this experiment, the extent of adaptivity to changes in
the dispersion of probabilities and to the presence or absence
of time pressure was tested. The main hypotheses are that
people will adapt their behavior to the demands ofthe decision
environment in accordance with the general patterns identified by the simulation.

Method
Subjects. A total of 16 undergraduates at Duke University served
as subjects. Participation in the experiment earned credit toward
fulfillment of a course requirement. In addition, the subjects had a
possibility of winning as much as $9.99, depending on their actual
choices.
Stimuli. The stimuli were sets of four risky options. Each option
in a set offered four possible outcomes (attributes). The outcomes
involved possible payoffs ranging from $0.01 to $9.99. Every option
in a set was defined in terms of the same four outcome probabilities.
The probabilities for any given outcome ranged from .01 to .96, with
the constraint that the four outcome probabilities summed to one.
Ten sets of high dispersion in probabilities (weights) options and
10 sets of low dispersion options were generated, with dominated
options allowed in all sets. In terms of the design used for the
simulation study, sets of options were sampled from the low-dispersion, dominance-possible and high-dispersion, dominance-possible
conditions. To illustrate, one low-dispersion set of gambles had

<-----Page 9----->ADAPTIVE DECISIONS
probabilities of .22, .26, .24, and .28 for the four possible outcomes.
Gamble A provided payoffs of $8.73, $7.83, $1.74, and $8.91, respectively, for the four outcomes. Gamble B provided payoffs of
$7.54, $4.64, $5.11, and $6.73. Gambles C and D had different, but
similar types of payoffs. One high-dispersion set of options, on the
other hand, had probabilities of .20, .04, .07, and .69. The payoffs for
Gamble A were $6.86, $1.18, $4.96, and $0.84, respectively. Gamble
B had payoffs of$1.38, $3.34, $8.49, and $2.91, respectively. Again,
Gambles C and D were similar. Overall, the sets of options in the
low- and high-dispersion conditions were equivalent in terms of their
average expected values.
The 20 sets of options (IO low dispersion, IOhigh dispersion) were
randomly presented under two time pressure conditions. One involved no explicit time pressure. Subjects could take as much time
as they wished to acquire information about probabilities and payoffs
and make a decision. The other condition involved a 15-s time
constraint. In this condition, a clock was shown in the upper-left
comer of the display with the information about the gambles (described more fully below). As the 15 s passed, the clock slowly
disappeared. At 15 s, a beep sounded, the subject could not acquire
additional information, and he or she was instructed to make a
choice. For comparison, a pilot study indicated that subjects took
about 50 s, on average, when under no time pressure. In the experiments reported below, subjects averaged approximately 44 s per trial
when under no time pressure.
There were 40 decision problems (2 context conditions x 2 time
pressure conditions x IO replications) presented to each subject in
random order, with the same random order used for all subjects. A
complete experimental session took 30-45 min for each subject.
The Mouselab methodology. Information acquisitions, response
times, and choices were monitored using a software system called
Mouselab (Johnson, Payne, Schkade, & Bettman, 1986). This system
uses an IBM personal computer, or equivalent, equipped with a
"mouse" for moving a cursor around the display screen of the
computer. The stimuli are presented on the display in the form of a
matrix of available information. The first row of boxes contained
information about the probabilities of the four outcomes. The next
four rows of boxes contained information about the payoffs associated
with the different outcomes for each alternative, respectively. At the
bottom of the screen were four boxes that were used to indicate which
alternative was most preferred. Figure 2 is an example of a stimulus
display with one box opened, and with the time pressure clock part
way through the countdown.
When a set of options first appears on the screen, the values of the
payoffs and probabilities are "hidden" behind the labeled boxes. To
open a particular box and examine the information, the subject has

to move the cursor into the box. The box immediately opens and
remains open until the cursor is moved out of the box. Only one box
can be open at a time.
The Mouselab program records the order in which boxes are
opened, the amount of time boxes are open, the chosen option, and
the total elapsed time since the display first appeared on the screen.
Response times are recorded to an accuracy of 1/60th of a second.
The Mouselab methodology comes close to the recording of eye
movements in terms of speed and ease of acquisitions, while minimizing instrumentation cost and difficulty of use for both subject and
experimenter. An analysis of the time necessary to move the mouse
between boxes in our displays using Fitts's Law indicates that one
could move between boxes in less than 100 ms (Card et al., 1983).
This suggeststhat the time to acquire information using the M ouselab
system is limited mainly by the time it takes to think where to point,
rather than by the time it takes to move the mouse. Although the use
of such a process-tracing system itself could possibly induce a change
in strategies, recent research using the M ouselab system has replicated
findings (e.g., preference reversals) found in studies that do not use
such a process-tracing mechanism (Johnson, Payne, & Bettman, in
press). There might also be concern that the tabular format is unnatural. However, tables of information appear in such magazines as
Consumer Reports, and many computer-based decision aids also use
a similar format.
Dependent measures. Information acquisition and decision behavior can be characterized in many ways. One can examine the amount
and sequence of information acquired, and the time spent acquiring
information (Klayman, 1983). To examine the aforementioned hypotheses, we consider seven measures of aspects of decision processing. One important aspect is the total amount of processing. One
measure of amount is the total number of times information boxes
were opened for a particular decision, denoted acquisitions (ACQ). A
second measure, which is related to the amount of processing effort
and is also directly relevant to the hypothesis of acceleration of
processing under time pressure, is the average time spent per item of
information acquired (TPERACQ).
The next several measures reflect the relative attention devoted to
specific types of information, and hence are relevant to characterizing
selectivity in processing and the related concept of filtration. One
measure, denoted PTMI, is the proportion of the total time acquiring
information that was spent in boxes involving the most important
attribute of a particular decision problem. The attribute (outcome)
with the largest weight (probability of occurrence) was defined to be
the most important attribute. The other measure, denoted PTPROB, is
the proportion of time spent on probability information as opposed
to information about payoff values.
The next two measures are the variances in the proportions of time
spent on each alternative (VAR-ALTER) and on each attribute (VARATTRIB). Such variances are related to selectivity. As described earlier
more compensatory decision rules (e.g., WADD, EQW, and MCD) imply
a pattern of information acquisition that is consistent (low in variance) across alternatives and attributes; in contrast, noncompensatory
strategies, like EBA, LEX, and SAT, imply more variance in processing.
A final measure of processing characterizes the sequence of information acquisitions relating to outcome values. Given the acquisition
of a particular piece of information, two particularly relevant cases
for the next piece of information acquired involve the same alternative but different attribute (an alternative-based, holistic, or Type I
transition), and the same attribute but a different alternative (an
attribute-based, dimensional, or Type 2 transition). A simple measure
of the relative amount of alternative-based (Type I) and attributebased (Type 2) transitions is provided by calculating the number of
Type I transitions minus the number of Type 2 transitions divided
by the sum of Type I and Type 2 transitions (Payne, 1976). This
measure of the relative use of alternative-based versus attribute-based

<-----Page 10----->544

J. PAYNE, J. BETTMAN, AND E. JOHNSON

processing, denoted PAITERN, ranges from a value of -1.0 to + 1.0.
A more positive number indicates relatively more alternative-based
processing, and a more negative number indicates relatively more
attribute-based processing.
In addition to these seven measures of processing, a measure of
relative accuracy, defined as above in terms of sv maximization and
random choice, was developed and denoted GAIN.
These measures can be related directly to the hypotheses outlined
previously. Higher dispersion in probabilities and higher time pressure
should lead to lower values of PAITERN (more attribute-based processing); higher values OfVAR-ALTER and VAR-AITRIB (greater selectivity); and higher values of PTPROB and PTMI (greater focus on probabilities and the most important attribute). In addition, there should
be fewer acquisitions (ACQ) and lower TPERACQ under high dispersion
(less processing effort), and TPERACQ should be lower under time
pressure. Finally, GAIN should be similar across levels of dispersion,
but lower under high time pressure.
Procedure. Each subject was told that the purpose of the experiment was to understand how people make decisions, that there were
no objectively "right" or "wrong" choices, and that the "best" action
was to choose that risky option they would most prefer to play.
Subjects were also told that at the end of the experiment a decision
problem would be selected at random, and the option they had
chosen would be played by randomly generating an outcome according to the probabilities for that option. They would be allowed to
keep whatever money they won. Thus, the subjects could win between
$0.01 and $9.99, depending on their choices and the random process.
Subjects then were instructed on the Mouselab information aequisition system and allowed to practice its use. Next, they were told
that they would be presented with a series of decisions involving
choices among risky options and that some decisions would involve
an explicit time constraint, whereas for other decision problems they
could take as long as they wished.

Results
Overview. The main focus in the results concerns how
people adapt to the task manipulation of time pressure and
the context manipulation of dispersion in probabilities. Effects
are examined for the foregoing four main types of dependent
measures: amount of processing, selectivity in processing,
pattern of processing, and relative accuracy.
To provide the strongest possible test of adaptivity, a withinsubjects experimental design was used. Subjects, however,

may have to experience several examples of different types of
decision problems before settling on a preferred strategy for a
particular type of problem. Consequently, the results are
presented both for the block of 20 decision problems seen
first by the decision maker, and the block of the last 20
decisions. Problems corresponding to each of the four timepressure-dispersion combinations were distributed essentially
equally over the two blocks.
A multivariate analysis. Given the likely correlations
among the various process measures, the data were first
analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance with three
within-subject factors (dispersion, time pressure, and block).
The analysis included the aforementioned seven process
measures plus the measure of relative accuracy, denoted GAIN.
The means for these measures are presented in Table 3.
Overall, the main effects of dispersion, F(8, 606) = 21.54,
time pressure, F(8, 606) = 62.98, and block, F(8, 606) = 6.28,
were highly significant (p < .001). There was a significant
dispersion by time pressure interaction, F(8, 606) = 4.05, P <
.00I, and an interaction of time pressure with block, F(8, 606)
= 5.38, p < .001. There was no interaction of block and
dispersion, F(8, 606) = 1.20, ns, although there was a significant three-way interaction of block by dispersion by time
pressure, F(8, 606) = 3.05, p < .01.
To more fully characterize the effects of dispersion, time
pressure, and block, separate univariate analyses of variance
were conducted for each of the dependent measures. The
results presented in Table 3 will first be discussed in terms of
dispersion in probabilities (a context effect), then for time
pressure (a task effect),and then briefly for block. Interactions
involving block are considered where relevant. Within each
section, the results are presented for the amount of processing
measures (ACQ and TPERACQ), then for the selectivitymeasures
(PTMI, PTPROB, VAR-ATTRIB, and VAR-ALTER), and then the
PATTERN measure. A summary of results at the individual
subject level is briefly presented, and then the GAIN measure
is discussed.
Effects ofdispersion. High dispersion was predicted to lead
to fewer acquisitions (ACQ), less time per acquisition (TPERACQ), greater focus on the most important dimension (PTMI)
and on probabilities (PTPROB), higher selectivity for attributes

and alternatives (VAR-ALTER), and more attribute-based processing (lower values of PATTERN). There was
no effect expected on GAIN. The dispersion manipulation
generally showed these effects.
As predicted, there was a significant difference between low
and high dispersion for both the number of acquisitions (ACQ)
(M= 28.90 vs. M= 23.82), F(l, 617) = 36.39,p< .001, and
time per acquisition (M = .60 vs. M = 57), F(l, 617) = 7.21,
P < .001. Less effort was used in reaching a decision for the
high-dispersion problems. The only significant dispersion by
time pressure interactions were for ACQ, F( 1, 617) = 12.91, p
< .00 I, and TPERACQ F(l, 617) = 12.56, p < .001. The effect
of dispersion is greater in the no-time-pressure problems.
The pattern of results for the variables related to selectivity
also was largely as predicted. There was more focus on the
dimension associated with the largest probability (PTMI) with
high dispersion of probabilities (M = .34 vs. M = .44), F(l,
617) = 92.34, p < .001. 2 However, contrary to prediction,
there was no significant difference in the proportion of time
spent on probabilities (M = .27 vs. M = .27), F(l, 617) =
1.34, ns. Both the variance in processing across attributes
(VAR-ATTRIB) and across alternatives (VAR-ALTER), on the
other hand, increased significantly for the high-dispersion
problems (M = .014 vs..030), F(l, 617) = 119.13, p < .001,
(M= .011 vs. M= .013), F(l, 617) = 7.14, p < .05, respectively. Thus, one effect of increased dispersion was to increase
the amount of selectivity in processing, which is consistent
with the use of heuristic processes such as the LEX or EBA
strategies.
The hypothesis of a shift in strategies due to the context
manipulation is also supported by the fact that the amount
of attribute-based processing (shown by negative values of
PATTERN) increased significantly as the dispersion of probabilities increased (M = -.12 vs. -.37), F(l, 613) = 54.60, p
< .001. This result for PATTERN is consistent with greater use
of strategies such as EBA or the lexicographic rule for high
dispersion in probabilities.
The foregoing results are averaged across subjects. Individual subjects showed patterns similar to those reported above.
For example, 86% of the subjects acquired less information
in the high-dispersion condition. Seventy-five percent spent
less time per acquisition for high-dispersion problems. One
hundred percent of the subjects spent more time on the most
important attribute, 56% spent more time on probabilities,
100% had greater variance in processing across attributes, and
82% had greater variance in processing across alternatives for
the high-dispersion problems. More attribute-based processing was shown by 82% of the subjects in the high-dispersion
condition than in the low-dispersion condition. Thus, both
group and individual analyses show adaptivity in process as a
function of context.
Finally, as expected, the average GAIN scores for the lowdispersion and high-dispersion problems did not differ significantly (M = .54 vs. M = .56), F( 1, 617) = .06, ns. The
accuracy of the processes used in the two contexts was approximately the same.
The simulation results suggest that an adaptive decision
maker could take advantage ofchanges in context to maintain
accuracy with substantially less processing effort. The experimental results clearly demonstrate a shift in processing strat(VAR-ATTRIB)

egies with variation in context. People demonstrated an ability
to shift processing to take advantage of problem structure so
as to reduce processing load while maintaining accuracy. The
empirical support for this relatively subtle prediction of the
simulation provides strong support for the current approach.
Previous work on contingent decision behavior has most
clearly demonstrated a sensitivity to effort, such as the effects
of variations in the number of alternatives or attributes
(Payne, 1982). The present work demonstrates an ability to
maintain accuracy even under a subtle change in context, as
well as sensitivity to effort.
Effects of time pressure. High time pressure was predicted
to lead to lower values for ACQ and TPERACQ; higher values
for PTMI, PTPROB, VAR-ATTRIB, and VAR-ALTER; a lower value
for PATTERN; and a lower value for GAIN.
As expected, subjects acquired fewer items of information
(ACQ) in the time-constrained choice environments (M =
35.98 vs. M = 16.74), F(1, 617) = 378.44, p < .001. This
finding was qualified by a block by time pressure interaction,
F(, 617) = 20.15, p < .001, which showed that the amount of
information acquisition did not vary over blocks in the hightime-pressure condition, but that the amount of information
acquired in the second block was less than that acquired in
the first block under no time pressure.
One major hypothesis regarding time pressure and decision
making is that people adapt to time constraints by accelerating
their processing. The results for the time per acquisition
variable (TPERACQ) indicate that people did process information significantly faster under time pressure (M = .67 s vs. M
= .48 s), F(l, 617) = 217.36, p < .001. A block by time
pressure interaction, F(l, 617) = 3.87,p < .05, showed that a
decrease over blocks only occurred in the no-time-pressure
condition. These results are consistent with those of Ben Zur
and Breznitz (1981).
The results for the variables related to selectivity and filtration also supported the hypotheses. The proportion of time
spent on the most important attribute (most likely outcome;
PTMI) was significantly greater under time pressure (M = .37
vs. M = .41), F(l, 617) = 9.83, p < .01. The proportion of
time spent on probabilities (PTPROB) was also greater for the
time-pressured problems (M = .25 vs. M = .29), F(1, 617) =
18.14, p < .001, clearly supporting the filtration hypothesis.
Greater selectivity in processing under time pressure was
also indicated by greater variance in processing the attributes
(v AR-ATTRIB) with a time constraint (M = .019 vs. M = .024),
F(1, 617) = 5.98, p < .05. Interestingly, there was no effect of
time pressure on the amount of variance in processing across
alternatives, (M = .30 vs. M = .31), F(l, 617) = .06, ns.
Although the lack of results for v AR-ALTER is not as hypothesized, the results for PTMI, PTPROB, and VAR-ATTRIB support
the notions of increasing filtration and selectivity under time
pressure.
Further evidence for a shift in information processing strategy as a function of time pressure is provided by the results

2 Analyses of variance for PTMI and PTPROB were also run with
both measures transformed by an are sine transformation. The results
were essentially the same, and the untransformed results are reported
for simplicity.

for PATIERN of processing. Under time constraint, processing
became marginally more attribute based (M = -.22 vs, M =
-.28), F(I, 617) = 3.55, p = .06.
To summarize, the results showed that people adapted to
time pressure by accelerating processing, increasing the selectivity of processing, and moving toward more attribute-based
processing. The latter two effects, taken together, are consistent with the greater use of heuristics like the LEX or EBA
strategy under time pressure.
Again, the means for each individual showed that a majority
of subjects responded in the same directions as indicated by
the group analysis. For instance, 100% of the subjects accelerated processing under time constraint (ACQ and TPERACQ).
Sixty-nine percent showed evidence of filtration as indicated
by PTMI and VAR-ATIRIB. Sixty-three percent demonstrated a
greater focus on probabilities, 44% showed higher values for
VAR-ALTER, and 63% demonstrated more attribute-based
processing under time constraints.
In addition to time pressure effects on processing, there was
a clear impact of time constraint on accuracy. Relative accuracy was lower under time pressure (M = .62 vs. M = .48),
F( I, 617) = 8.32, p < .0 I. An examination of the pattern of
means in Table 3, however, makes it clear that the decrement
in performance is concentrated in the responses to the earlier
(first block) problems involving time pressure. By the latter
block, performance had improved to levels similar to those
obtained in the no-time-pressure condition, as verified by a
significant block by time pressure interaction, F( I, 617) =
10.73, p < .01.

Discussion
The central conclusion from the results of Experiment I is
that people exhibit a substantial degree of adaptivity in their
decision behavior. Decision processes were sensitive to a
context variable that influences the relative accuracy of heuristics. Decision processes were also sensitive to the important
task variable of time pressure. Across a variety of dependent
measures, the pattern of results supported the predictions.
These findings of adaptivity are particularly strong in that
they were exhibited by the same subjects on different trials.
Finally, the general pattern of adaptive behavior was consistent with the simulation results.
The time-pressure results supported the hypotheses that
increased time pressure wold result in (a) acceleration of
information processing, (b) filtration of information to be
processed, and (c) to a lesser extent, changes in the choice
heuristics used to make a decision. Prior research has supported the acceleration and filtration hypotheses, but the
present experiment also suggestschanges in information processing strategies as a function of time pressure.
The existence of at least three ways in which people can
adapt to time pressure leads to the following question: Is there
an ordering to the adaptive strategies people use to deal with
time pressure? That is, do people first try to deal with time
constraints through acceleration and perhaps filtration of
processing? Selecting an alternative decision process in response to time pressure may only occur if the first two
responses are not adequate. The next experiment investigates

that possibility by examining a case of less severe time pressure.
Experiment 2
This study examines the extent and direction of adaptive
decision processing when the amount of time pressure is less
severe than that investigated in Experiment 1. Specifically,
one time pressure condition in this study used a 25-s limit.
For comparison, and also for purposes of replication, a second
time pressure condition used the 15-s limit used in Experiment 1. Furthermore, subjects in this study returned for a
second day. During the second session, the experiment was
repeated, but with the time pressure level set at 25 s if a
subject had received 15 s on the first day or set at 15 s if a
subject had 25 s on the first day. The inclusion of the second
session was intended to explore how adaptivity to one choice
environment might influence adaptivity to a slightly different
choice environment. Finally, this study again examined the
effects of dispersion in probabilities.

Method
Subjects. A total of 28 undergraduate students served as subjects
in this experiment in return for course credit and the chance to win
money. Because this experiment involved two different experimental
sessions, the maximum amount of money that could be won was
$19.98 ($9.99 for each session).
Stimuli and procedures. The stimuli and procedures used in this
study were essentially the same as those used in Experiment I. For
the first session, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
time pressure = 15 s (Group I) or time pressure = 25 s (Group 2).
Owing to computer problems, cell sizeswere unequal, with 16 subjects
in Group 1 and 12 subjects in Group 2. One difference in instructions
from the previous experiment was that subjects were told how much
time was involved in the time pressure trials. After the end of the first
session, a gamble preferred by the subject was selected, but not played.
The second session had the time pressure set at the level opposite to
that received on the first day. Also, the order of the outcomes and
alternatives was permuted for the sets of gambles to reduce the
possibility that the subject would remember the particular choice
problems from the previous day.

Results
The measures of process and accuracy used in this study
were the same as those used in the previous experiment. Table
4 presents the means for each of the seven process measures
and GAIN as a function of day, group, presence/absence of
time pressure, and low versus high dispersion. The data were
analyzed with a five within-subjects factor multivariate analysis of variance (presence of time pressure, dispersion, block,
day, and level of time pressure: 25 s vs. IS s). Subjects was
treated as a factor nested within day and level.
The multivariate analysis of variance showed significant
effects of dispersion, F(8, 2147) = 116.24, p < .001, and
presence of time pressure, F(8, 2147) = 200.64, p < .001. In
addition, the main effects of day, F(8, 2147) = 21.42, level of
time pressure, F(8, 2147) = 18.16, and block, F(8, 2147) =
23.63, were all significant (p < .001).
The two-way interactions were generally significant as well.
Of most interest were a presence oftime pressure by dispersion

interaction, F(8, 2147) = 54.13, p < .001, a presence of time
pressure by block interaction, F(8, 2147) = 10.39, p < .001,
and a day by level of time pressure interaction, F(8, 2147) =
54.13, p < .001. The first two interactions are consistent with
those obtained in Experiment 1. The latter interaction suggests that it did matter whether a subject received the 15-s
(severe time pressure) problems on the first or second day.
Analyses of simple effects within the 15-s and 25-s timepressure groups were performed. Because the major focus
of Experiment 2 was on time-pressure effects, those results
are discussed first, followed by results for dispersion. Then
effects of day and level are briefly considered. The predictions
for the various dependent variables are the same as in
Experiment 1.
Time pressure effects. The results most comparable to Experiment 1, ofcourse, are the first-day results. An examination
of the first-day process means for Group 1 (time pressure =
15 s) and Group 2 (time pressure = 25 s), reported in Table
4, indicates that the previous findings for 15 s did replicate,
and that there may be a hierarchy of responses to levels of
time pressure.
An analysis of simple effects for the variables related to
amount of processing showed fewer acquisitions with time
pressure present for both the 15-s (M = 46.43 vs. M = 18.38),
F(1, 2154) = 507.01, p < .001, and the 25-s conditions (M =
49.03 vs. M = 28.25), F(1, 2154) = 209.82, p < .001. There
was also less time per acquisition under time pressure in both

cases: 15-s condition (M = .63 vs. M = .48), F(1, 2154 =
394.92, p < .001; 25-s condition (M = .63 vs. M = .52), F(1,
2154) = 156.88, p < .001. Thus, both time pressure levels
show evidence consistent with acceleration of processing.
Analyses of simple effects for the amount of filtration and
selectivity in processing show similar patterns within the 15-s
and 25-s time-pressure conditions for the first day. However,
the results for the 15-s level of time pressure are generally
stronger. For the 15-s level, there were effects of time pressure
on PTMI (M = .33 vs. M = .37), F(l, 2154) = 22.86, p < .001,
PTPROB (M = .25 vs. M = .28), F(1,2154) = 11.76, p < .001,
and VAR-ATTRIB (M = .013 vs. M = .020), F(1, 2154) = 37.37,
p < .001. There was no effect on VAR-ALTER (M = .011 vs. M
= .011), F(1, 2154) = .02, ns. There was an effect of time
pressure for the 25-s level on PTMI (M = .34 vs. M = .37),
F(l, 2154) = 4.99, p < .05, and marginal effects for PTPROB
(M = .20 vs. M = .21), F(l, 2154) = 3.71, p < .06, and VARATTRIB (M = .011 vs. M .014), F(1, 2154) = 3.66, p < .06.
There was no effect on VAR-ALTER (M = .009 vs, M = .009),
F( 1, 2154) = .26, ns. Thus, there is evidence for selectivity
under both time pressure conditions, although there appears
to be more selectivity when time pressure is severe.
Of greatest importance for the hypothesis of a hierarchy of
time pressure effects was the finding of a significant effect of
time pressure on pattern of processing in the first day for the
15-s condition (M = -.11 vs. M = -.17), F(1, 2154) = 4.86,
P < .05, with more attribute-based processing under time

<-----Page 14----->548

pressure. In contrast, however, there was no effect of time
pressure on pattern of processing in the 25-s condition (M =
.15 vs. M = .18), F(1, 2154) = 1.21, ns. Thus, we find evidence
of a shift toward more attribute-based processing under severe
time pressure, but no shift in processing with moderate time
pressure. 3
Finally, accuracy (GAIN) was lower under time pressure for
both the 15-s (M = .58 vs. M = .43), F(I, 2154) = 9.22, p <
.01, and 25-s conditions (M = .77 vs. M = .66), F(I, 2154) =
4.95, p < .05. Although not shown in Table 4, the detrimental
effect of time pressure on GAIN was again greatest for the first
block of trials, particularly for the 15-s condition (M = .29).
Dispersion effects. The pattern of effects for dispersion in
probabilities for Experiment 2 was similar to that found for
Experiment 1. With respect to amount of processing, for the
15-s condition there was an effect of dispersion on ACQ (M =
35.19 vs. M = 29.67), F(1, 2154) = 24.54, p < .001, and a
marginal effect on TPERACQ (M = .56 vs. M = .55), F(1, 2154)
= 2.77, p < .10. For the 25-s condition, there was an effect
on ACQ (M = 40.81 vs. M = 36.46), F(1, 2154) = 16.41, p <
.001, and a marginal effect on TPERACQ (M = .58 vs. M =
.57), F(1, 2154) = 3.52, p < .07.
Analyses of simple effects for the selectivity and filtration
measures show effects for the 15-s level on PTMI (M = .31 vs.
M = .40), F(1, 2154) = 134.98, p < .001, PTPROB (M = .25
vs. M = .28), F(1, 2154) = 7.01, p < .01, VAR-ATTRIB (M =
.010 vs. M = .022), F(I, 2154) = 130m, p < .001, and VARALTER(M= .0IOvs.M= .013),F(I,2154)= 14.83,p< .001.
For the 25-s group there were effects on PTMI (M = .31 vs. M
= .40), F(1, 2154) = 112.62, P < .001, and VAR-ATTRIB (M =
.005 vs. M = .019), F(1, 2154) = 115.15, p < .001. There was
a marginal effect on PTPROB (M = .20 vs. M = .21), F(1,
2154) = 2.72, p < .10, and a marginal effect on VAR-ALTER
(M = .008 vs. M = .010), F(I, 2154) = 3.20, p < .08. Thus,
there is evidence for greater selectivity under high dispersion,
but it is stronger for the 15-s condition.
There were also strong effects on PATTERN for both the 15s (M = -.01 vs. M = -.27), F(1, 2154) = 82.03, p < .001,
and 25-s conditions (M = .31 vs. M = .01), F(1, 2154) =
91.99, p < .001. Processing becomes more attribute based
with higher dispersion. The results for dispersion for the 25-s
condition are important in that they demonstrate adaptation
to the dispersion manipulation. Hence, the failure to adapt to
time pressure via strategy change in the 25-s condition is not
due to a total failure to obtain adaptivity in that condition.
There are no effects of dispersion on GAIN in either the 15s (M = .50 vs. M = .51), F(1, 2154) = .09, ns, or 25-s
conditions (M = .70 vs. M = .71), F(1, 2154) = .06, ns.
Finally, there are significant dispersion by time pressure interactions for ACQ, F(1, 2154) = 10.36, p < .001, TPERACQ,
F(1, 2154) = 6.04, p < .01, and VAR-ATTRIB, F(1, 2154) =
10.61,P < .001, for the 15-s condition; for the 25-s condition,
the only significant interaction was for ACQ, F(1, 2154) =
10.80, p < .001.
Once again, the hypothesis of adaptivity in processing was
strongly supported for dispersion in probabilities. The subjects
in Experiment 2, like those in Experiment 1, were apparently
able to take advantage ofcontext changes to reduce processing
effort while maintaining essentially the same level ofaccuracy.

Day and level effects. As noted earlier, the multivariate
analysis of variance showed a significant day by level interaction. Subjects who experienced a moderate time constraint
on the first day acted differently than did those who faced a
severe constraint on the first day. An examination of the
results in Table 4 indicates little difference in the processing
for Group 2 (25-s time pressure for the first day) between Day
1 and Day 2. The means for both VAR-ATTRIB and PATTERN,
for example, are similar for each day. A simple explanation
is that a 15-s time constraint on the second day was not that
severe a time constraint. Experience with the task on the first
day resulted in the constraint of 15 s on the second day being
more like a moderate level of time pressure. On the other
hand, note that the second-day responses for Group 1 (15-s
time pressure for the first day) are intermediate between the
first day responses to 15-s time pressure and the first day
responses to 25-s time pressure.
Another interesting comparison concerns the no-time-pressure data for Groups 1 and 2 on the first day. Consider, for
example, the results for PATTERN. The no-time-pressure mean
for the 15-s condition was -.11. The mean for the 25-s
condition was .15. Thus, it appears that there was some
carryover from behavior generated in response to the timepressure trials to the no-time-pressure trials. This suggeststhat
the degree of adaptivity to time pressure found in these
experiments was not perfect on a trial by trial basis. The
development of a strategy appropriate to a particular level of
time pressure apparently affected the strategy used in the notime-pressure situations. There is also evidence for such carryover in the second-day responses of Group 1 discussed
earlier.
Discussion
The results of Experiment 2 support the findings of Experiment 1 and show that subjects adapt to changes in context
(dispersion) by exhibiting changes in selectivity, type of processing, and amount of processing while maintaining accuracy.
Subjects appear to adapt to severe time pressure by acceleration, filtration, and changes in strategy. They do not appear
to change strategy in response to more moderate time pressure. The second-day results also demonstrate some interesting effects regarding how adaptation to one choice environment carries over to adaptation to a different choice environment. Table 5 summarizes the main effects for dispersion and
time pressure for both experiments.

An Alternative Hypothesis
Although the pattern of results for time pressure for Experiment 2 is consistent with the findings of Experiment 1, an
3 A third experiment, identical in procedure to Experiment I but
using a 25-s level of time pressure, was also conducted. The results
were similar to those reported in the text. Under 25 s of time pressure
there was evidence of acceleration of processing, weak support for
the hypothesis of filtration, and no evidence of changes in the pattern
of processing. More details on that experiment are available from the
authors.

alternative explanation, suggestedby an anonymous reviewer,
must be examined. Suppose subjects only adjust to the dispersion manipulation. They might do this by first examining
the probabilities and then engaging in a mixture of attributeand alternative-based processing under low dispersion or
mostly attribute-based processing if dispersion is high. If one
supposes further that whatever alternative-based processing is
used tends to be greater toward the end of the choice process,
then a simple truncation of the process under time pressure
could lead to the observed results. Subjects may not change
their processing strategy but may simply use a truncated
version of the strategy under time pressure. This possibility
must be seriously considered, as prior research (e.g., Bettman
& Park, 1980) has shown that alternative-based processing
does increase relative to attribute-based processing later in the
choice process.
To examine this alternative hypothesis, we consider processing patterns early in the choice process. In particular, we
consider the processing occurring in the first eight acquisitions
of each time pressure trial. Eight acquisitions were selected at
the unit of analysis for several reasons. First, two distinct
processing patterns could be exhibited within eight acquisitions, namely, examination of all four probabilities and all
four values for one alternative or acquiring information on
all four probabilities and all four values for one attribute
across alternatives. Although subjects may not follow these
two patterns in pure form, eight acquisitions should allow for
any differential tendencies in starting the process to emerge.
Second, eight acquisitions is also roughly half the average
number of acquisitions for the 15-s time pressure condition.
Over 98% of the trials had eight acquisitions or more.
The alternative hypothesis can be tested by comparing the
processing patterns for these first eight acquisitions for each
time pressure trial for the 15-s and 25-s time pressure conditions. If the alternative truncation hypothesis is correct, there
should be no difference between the 15-s and 25-s conditions
on these initial acquisitions for the time pressure trials, as the

overall differences between these conditions are hypothesized
to be due to truncation at the end of the process. If our
interpretation that subjects are using different strategies is
correct, however, there should be differences between the 15sand 25-s conditions at the beginning of the process.
We analyzed the data for the first eight acquisitions for each
time pressure trial from Experiment 2. The variables examined were two selectivity measures, the variances in the proportion of time spent on attributes (VAR-ATTRIB) and alternatives (VAR-ALTER); and the relative proportion of alternative- and attribute-based processing (PATTERN). These
variables were selected because they should provide sensitive
indices of the early processing pattern. We have hypothesized
that subjects under severe time pressure should try to do a
quick evaluation of as many alternatives as possible on a
limited number of attributes. This pattern should not characterize subjects with 25-s time pressure if our hypothesis that
strategy change occurs only under severe time pressure is
correct. That implies more attribute-based processing and
greater variation in processing across attributes for the 15-s
condition. Because only the first few acquisitions are examined, this should also imply less variation across alternatives
for the 15-scondition, because subjects will not have had time
to eliminate alternatives. Rather, they may be doing an initial
screening, with the values of all alternatives examined for the
attribute or attributes considered. Thus, the strategy change
hypothesis predicts the foregoing differences between the 15sand 25-s conditions for the eight initial acquisitions per time
pressure trial, whereas a strict truncation hypothesis should
predict no differences.
The results support the strategy change hypothesis and are
not consistent with the truncation hypothesis. VAR-ATTRIB is
marginally greater for the 15-s condition than the 25-s condition (M = .033 vs. M = .026), F(l, 526) = 2.84, p < .10,
and VAR-ALTER is significantly less for the 15-s condition (M
= .075 vs. M= .105), F(l, 510) = 7.03,p< .02. The tendency
for the 15-s condition to engage in more attribute-based

<-----Page 16----->550

processing (more negative values of PATIERN) is also marginally significant (M = -.33 vs. M = .01), F(I, 474) = 3.35, p
< .08. Although these results do not all reach conventional
.05 levels of significance, they are all directionally consistent
with the strategy change hypothesis rather than truncation. In
addition, there were no significant differences on these variables for the no-time-pressure trials between the 15-s and 25s conditions, F(l, 526) = 1.31, F(l, 473) = .18, and F(I, 382)
= .59 for VAR-ATIRIB, VAR-ALTER, and PATIERN, respectively.
This supports the notion that different strategies are adaptive
responses to different levels of time pressure, not a general
tendency of the different subject groups.
To provide further insights into the pattern of processing
over the course of a decision, the responses of subjects were
compared for the first eight acquisitions and last eight acquisitions of all trials on PATIERN and PTPROB. Consistent with
prior research (Bettman & Park, 1980), there was more attribute-based processing for the earlier acquisitions than for the
later acquisitions, both for the 15-s condition (M = -.35 vs.
-.05), F(l, 1137) = 46.86, p < .001, and the 25-s condition
(M = -.08 vs..26), F(l' 873) = 51.94, p < .001. There was
also a greater initial focus on probabilities for both the 15-s
(M = .57 vs. M = .11), F(I, 1264) = 1837.04, p < .001, and
25-s conditions (M = .58 vs. M = .08), F(I, 944) = 2576.23,
p < .00 I. The PTPROB means were essentially the same for
both the 15-s and 25-s conditions. Thus, the 15-s and 25-s
conditions exhibit different responses to time pressure from
the beginning. Even though processing becomes relatively
more alternative based over the course ofa trial, the difference
between the two conditions remains.

General Discussion
Previous research has shown that the same individual will
often use diverse strategies to make a decision, contingent on
task demands (Payne, 1982). A major problem for current
cognitive research is to be able to better understand and
predict when a particular strategy will be used.
This article has examined effort and accuracy considerations in the selection of strategies for making a choice. The
general hypothesis is that selection among strategies is adaptive, in that a decision maker will choose strategies that are
relatively efficient in terms of effort and accuracy as task and
context demands are varied. The article first outlined an
approach to modeling the impact oftask and context variables
on decision strategies by using elementary information processes to measure effort and computer simulation models to
examine accuracy and effort trade-ofTs. A Monte-Carlo simulation examined the impact of variation in the presence or
absence of time pressure, dispersion in probabilities, presence
or absence of dominated alternatives, and different problem
sizes on the accuracy and effort of a variety of choice heuristics. Strategies were identified that approximate the accuracy
of normative procedures while requiring substantially less
effort. However, no single heuristic did well across all task
and context conditions. A decision maker striving to maintain
a high level of accuracy with a minimum of effort would have
to use a variety of heuristics adaptively. Of particular interest
was the finding that under time constraints, several attribute-

based heuristics (e.g., EBA and LEX) were more accurate than
a normative procedure such as expected value maximization,
because that procedure had to be truncated when it ran out
of time .
The simulation does not really answer the question of how
a strategy is selected, however. The implicit viewpoint in our
work is that a decision maker possesses a repertoire of welldefined strategies and selects among them when faced with a
decision by considering the expected costs and expected benefits of each strategy. This top-down view of strategy selection
is consistent with previous models like that of Beach and
Mitchell (1978). Alternatively, strategies may develop during
the course of solving a decision problem in a more bottomup, constructive, and ad hoc fashion (Bettman, 1979).
Throughout a choice episode a decision maker will be alert
to structure in the choice set that can be exploited to reduce
effort and perhaps increase accuracy. Regardless of how strategy selection is controlled, the simulation results do suggest
how certain context and task variables affect the relative effort
and accuracy of possible strategies.

Adaptivity to Decision Environments
Experiments 1 and 2 tested the degree of correspondence
between the efficient processing strategies for a given decision
problem identified by the simulations and the actual information processing behavior exhibited by people. The results
for actual decision behavior tended to validate the patterns
predicted by the simulation.
More specifically, subjects generally acquired less information, spent less time per acquisition, spent proportionately
more time on the most important attribute, displayed greater
variance in the proportion of time spent on the various
alternatives and attributes, and used more attribute-based
processing when dispersion in the weights (probabilities), a
context variable, was high rather than low. The effects of
dispersion on the proportion of time spent on probabilities
were not consistent across studies, although more time was
spent on probabilities under high dispersion in the majority
of cases. Such adaptivity in strategy usage in response to a
context variable demonstrates that people are sensitive to a
change in the task environment that potentially impacts the
relative accuracy of heuristics as well as affecting relative
effort.
In addition, several effects of time pressure were demonstrated. Under moderate time pressure, subjects were shown
to accelerate their processing. There was some evidence, although weaker, that subjects selectively focus on a subset of
the available information. Under severe time pressure, people
accelerated their processing, focused on a subset of the information, and changed their information processing strategies.
There was more attribute-based processing and more variance
in the proportion of time spent on various attributes as time
pressure increased. Counter to predictions, there were not
systematic effects of time pressure on the variance in the
proportion of time spent on various alternatives, implying
that subjects were equally consistent in the proportion of
information searched across alternatives, regardless of time
pressure. One possible explanation is that the nature of the

<-----Page 17----->551

ADAPTIVE DECISIONS

display may have made complete scans of an attribute relativelyeasy.
Across the two experiments, the relative amount of dimensional processing (PATTERN) was an average of 41% greater
under time pressure of 15 s compared with no time pressure.
In contrast, the relative amount of dimensional processing
was 20% less under time pressure of 25 s compared with no
time pressure. The variance in processing across attributes
(VAR-ATTRIB) was increased by 40% on average for the 15-s
time pressure conditions versus no time pressure; however,
the average increase was 21% for the 25-s time-pressure
conditions.
There are several important aspects of these time-pressure
results. First, they provide a strong demonstration of the
adaptivity of processing strategies to time pressure. Second,
the results of the experiments imply that there may be a
hierarchy of responses to time pressure. People may first
attempt to simply accelerate their processing and try to do
the same things faster. If the time pressure is too great for
acceleration to suffice, individuals may next engage in filtration, focusing on a subset of the available information. Finally, people may change strategies when time pressures become extreme. Of course, the specific strategies found in our
studies may be a function of the problem format used. Different adaptive strategies would presumably be found for
ditTerent task structures.

Learning Effort-Accuracy Trade-offs
The evidence for processing changes reported in the present
experiments suggests that people were learning to adapt their
behavior to changes in task and context. Yet none of the
experiments provided the subjects with explicit accuracy or
outcome feedback. Johnson and Payne (1985) argued that a
decision maker has access to a fairly rich data base about the
course of his or her own decision processes. They hypothesize
that this process feedback could provide the information
necessary for strategy change. For example, a decision maker
might induce the LEX rule by first noticing that certain outcomes seem much more probable than others (Klein, 1983,
reports data supporting this kind of learning about the task).
Next, the decision maker might evaluate a strategy that takes
advantage of the features of the task by checking whether the
outcomes are consistent with several simple principles of
choice. For instance, the decision maker might check that the
new strategy does not select dominated alternatives, and that
it selects alternatives that have satisfactory levels of other
outcomes.
General knowledge of what makes for a good decision
process may also playa role in learning to adapt. For instance,
the idea that a good decision requires considering all relevant
information is likely to be held by many people, as is the
notion that a good process will examine the most important
information." Consequently, when faced with a decision task
in which it is impossible or very difficult to process all
information, the decision maker might use the information
he or she has gained about the task to decide what information
is less important and can be ignored. An example of such task

information is that some probabilities are much smaller than
others under high-dispersion conditions.
The data presented in this article demonstrate that people
shift decision strategies in response to a context change in
ways that maintain accuracy, without explicit outcome feedback. Reder (1987) has also found evidence of strategy
changes in a question answering task without outcome feedback. She suggests several ideas regarding the mechanisms of
adaptive strategy selection, such as a "feeling-of-knowing"
process, that may relate to the "level of confidence" discussed
by Busemeyer (1985). People may seek to develop strategies
that take advantage of problem structure so as to minimize
etTort while maintaining a feeling of knowing or desired level
of confidence that they are making a reasonable decision.
The present results, taken as a whole, provide strong evidence for adaptivity in decision making, although the degree
of adaptivity was not perfect. There did appear to be some
carry-over etTects in terms of processing strategies from trial
to trial and from day to day. Despite these carry-over etTects,
however, individuals did change information processing strategies depending upon the changing structure of the choice
environment from problem to problem. This variability in
processing from one problem to the next implies that humans
possess abilities for assessing choice environment properties;
characterizing such abilities would be a fruitful area for study.
It is likely that certain environmental properties may be more
easily noticed, and hence more adapted to, than others. For
example, it may be difficult for people to notice attribute
intercorrelations (Crocker, 1981).
Finally, the evidence for adaptive use of heuristics obtained
in this study suggests a picture of the human decision maker
that is fairly optimistic in terms of rational behavior. People
clearly do use choice heuristics that lead to violations of
certain principles of rationality (Tversky, 1969). The use of
heuristic processes that lead to decision errors may reflect a
trade-otT of etTort and accuracy, or reflect the fact that the
decision maker has no other choice in some decision environments than the use of a heuristic (Simon, 1981). However,
our results suggest that people can adaptively change processing strategies in ways that are appropriate given somewhat
subtle changes in the structure of the decision problems they
face.
_As part of the debriefing process for Experiment 2, subjects were
asked what strategy they would advocate to identify the "best" choice
under no time pressure. The use of all information, including a
weighting of payoffs by probabilities, was identified by many of the
subjects. For time pressure, the subjects indicated that use of as much
of the most important information as possible was a major consideration.
