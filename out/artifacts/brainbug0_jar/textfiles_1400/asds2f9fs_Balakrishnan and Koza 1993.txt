We propose that intermediate
forms of organization
like joint-ventures
are superior to markets
and hierarchies
when the costs of valuing complementary
assets are non-trivial.
By allowing
piecemeal transactions
under shared ownership
and control, joint-ventures
can reduce these
costs significantly.
Our theory is supported
by the results of a cross-sectional
analysis of the
abnormal
returns
to the parent firms in 64 joint-venture
announcements
and 165 merger
announcements.

A joint venture is a special mechanism
for pooling complementary
assets
owned by separate firms.’ In most joint ventures the parent firms combine
part or all of their assets into a legally separate unit and agree to share the
profits from the venture. Like the more typical common stock company, this
unit is usually free to raise additional
capital, enter into contracts, buy and
sell goods and sevices, hire employees,
and the like. In matters of policy
making and control, however, the joint venture is more like a partnership.

typical common stock company
is governed by a Board, which acts as the
fiduciary
agent of the numerous
stockholders
at large who are mostly
investors with little or no interest in policy or control. In a joint venture, the
ownership and control is shared by the parents in a more active sense. The
parent firms through their appointed
representatives
have a direct interest in
the policy decisions and the control of the operations
of the ‘child’. Often, an
explicit collateral contract or agreement accompanies
the formation of a joint
venture, which stipulates
the mutual rights and obligations
of the parent
firms.
In this paper, we present a comparison
of joint-ventures,
market mediated
contracts and hierarchical
governance
and analyze the trade-offs between (i)
the transaction
costs in writing and executing contracts in the intermediate
product market, (ii) the costs that accompany
transactions
that redistribute
the ownership
of assets, and (iii) the costs of administering
hierarchies
and
joint-ventures.
The line of argument
is as follows. Acquisition
of the
complementary
assets is desirable to economize on the transaction
costs that
are associated with market mediated contracts for the supply of intermediate
products.
When the relevant assets are not homogeneous
and information
about their quality, performance
characteristics,
and value is not common
knowledge,
the costs of redistributing
ownership
rights over the assets are
non-trivial.
Asymmetric
information
about the quality or the value of the
target assets causes an ‘adverse selection’ or a ‘lemon’ problem
[Akerlof
(1970)] resulting in roadblocks
to a complete transfer of ownership rights. A
joint-venture
is primarily
a mechanism
for getting around this problem. It
avoids a terminal
transaction
that transfers
ownership
rights and allows
piecemeal and continuous
reassessment
of the individual
contributions
to the
venture.
A testable implication
is that the shareholders
of the parent companies will
be more favorably
disposed towards joint-ventures
than acquisitions
when
the parents are less informed
about each other’s business. With potential
aggravation
of the ‘lemon’ problem,
acquisition
will be more costly. We
tested this with a sample of 64 domestic joint-ventures
and 165 acquisitions
using the event study method. The results obtained
from a cross-sectional
analysis of the abnormal
returns to the shareholders
during the announcement of these joint-ventures
and acquisitions,
support our hypothesis.

1. Joint-ventures:

Between markets and hierarchies

The literature on joint-ventures
spans several disciplines including finance,
industrial
organization,
organization
theory, and business policy. A theoretical issue that has not been addressed until recently is the relative efficiency of
joint-ventures
and other mechanisms
for coordination
such as contracts and

<-----Page 2----->S. Balakrishnan, Information asymmetry, adverse selection and joint-ventures

101

hierarchies.’
Most modern businesses and technologies
require a variety of
laterally
or vertically
complementary
assets and functional
capabilities
to
produce
and deliver a marketable
product.
Williamson
(1975, 1985) has
compared
two alternative
mechanisms
by which firms may access complementary assets: (i) market mediated contract and (ii) hierarchy. A firm may
choose to buy the relevant intermediate
products from a supplier under a
spot or long-term contract, negotiated
on an arm’s length basis. Difficulty in
specifying the quality of the intermediate
products, uncertainty
about future
and bounded
rationality,
may prevent the transacting
firms from writing
complete contracts which specify all contingencies,
leaving scope for opportunistic behavior and bargaining
over the terms. Investments
in idiosyncratic
or specialized assets for carrying out the transaction
may become a hostage
in the ex-post small-number
negotiations
[Klein et al. (1978), Williamson
(1979)]. These transaction
costs that accompany
market mediated contracts
can be mitigated or eliminated when the complementary
assets are integrated
under a common ownership or hierarchy.
The integration
may be accomplished
through greenfield investment.
This
option often involves costly and time-consuming
R&D and other tasks.
Knowledge
and organizational
limitations
will constrain
the speed and
efficiency with which the firm can carry out these tasks. On the other hand,
strategic considerations
such as first-mover
advantages,
may warrant
the
speedy completion
of these tasks. The firm may, therefore, decide to acquire
part or all of an extant firm which already has the technology
and other
assets.
Another option is to form a joint-venture
by pooling the complementary
assets of the two firms. By most definitions, joint-ventures
imply equity and
profit sharing. The essential characteristic
of a joint-venture
is that unlike a
hierarchy, there is no ultimate ‘unity of command’ and property rights and
control
are shared by the parent
tirms.3 A collateral
contract
usually
specifies and limits the rights and obligations
of the parent firms. Both
acquisition
and joint-venture
considerably
shorten the internalization
process
and save valuable time.
Why do firms choose to joint-venture
when they could have merged or
sold assets to form a hierarchy? The unique features of a joint-venture
are
shared ownership
and control.
A theory of joint-ventures
should explain
what diseconomies
of acquisitions
motivate the parents to settle for shared
ownership
and control. Acquisitions
can be costly for a variety of reasons.
Often only a portion of the assets of the ‘target firm may be required for the

analysis of joint-ventures

acquiring firm’s new venture. When these assets are not clearly identifiable
or
alienable, a complete merger of the two firms’ assets may be warranted
but
this will result in additional
costs of administering
and controlling
unconnected assets and businesses. High-powered
incentives may also be lost in the
conglomeration
of businesses that do not produce any off-setting synergistic
gains. It is also possible that the relevant assets may be shared by other lines
of businesses
of the target firm. Acquiring
these assets introduces
new and
potentially
costly transactions
between the acquiring firm and target firm.
Whereas the afore-mentioned
diseconomies
of acquisition
are ex post costs
of organization,
acquisitions
suffer from another
important
diseconomy
which relates to the ex ante costs of satisfactory valuation
and pricing of the
target assets. In the remainder
of the paper we focus on the differential
advantages
of joint-ventures
over acquisition
in these ex ante costs.4

2. Information

asymmetry,

adverse selection and the joint-venture

2.1. The valuation problem
It is reasonable
to expect that the target firm will not sell the assets in its
possession unless it receives a bid which is at least equal to the net present
value of its assets. If the target assets are specialized
and there are no
competitive
markets in which identical assets are traded, information
on their
prices will be either costly to obtain or unavailable.
A self-interested
target
firm can exploit this situation and opportunistically
misrepresent
the value of
its assets. Two examples from the takeover market illustrate
the problems
and the pitfalls that a prospective
buyer faces. After acquiring
Collins and
Aikman,
a carpet manufacturing
firm, Wickes Inc., discovered
that the
company had defaulted on certain federal flammability
standards concerning
carpets it had supplied to schools. To meet the potential
product liabilities,
Wickes had to set aside roughly $300 million which was 20% of the purchase
price of Colling and Aikman. In another instance CPC, a food processor and
corn milling company
had acquired
Mueller, a large pasta business, from
McKesson,
a San Francisco
based company
for $125 million in 1983. In
1985, CPC tiled a $76 million suit against McKesson
and Morgan Stanley,
the investment
bankers for the acquisition,
charging that it was induced to
make the acquisition
by fictitious
projections
of Mueller’s near-term
and
future performance.
Ravenscraft
and Scherer (1987) describe several other
instances in which both apparent
and latent problems with the target firms
fail to surface, even if pre-merger inspections
were undertaken.
The target firm obviously
has better information
about the true value of
4Hennart (1988) describes a few other diseconomies
of acquisition.
These relate to international arena where cultural and national interests may make acquisitions
more costly than jointventures. Also, see Kogut and Singh (1985), who present some evidence for this.

<-----Page 4----->S. Balakrishnan, Information asymmetry,

103

its assets and capabilities
because of prior ownership
and use. It may,
however, choose to withhold
information
about quality or organizational
problems and inflate output and other positive aspects. As Ravenscraft
and
Scherer (1987) put it, ‘Would-be sellers naturally
present their best face.’ The
target firm cannot credibly assure the acquiring firm that it will disclose all
the information
that it has and negotiate the sale in good faith, even if it
were inclined to do so. The transfer of ownership
of the complementary
assets is thus impacted by ‘adverse selection’ [Akerlof (1970)]. The acquiring
firm, recognizing
the information
asymmetry
and the potential for opportunistic misrepresentation
by the target, will discount the price offered accordingly. Although
negotiations
may continue
and the acquiring
firm may
sweeten its offer, the process will be terminated
without a sale if the final
offer falls short of what the target firm knows to be the true value of the
assets.5 There is evidence of several unsuccessful
acquisition
attempts from
empirical finance. Bradley (1980) reports that 97 tender offers in his sample
of 258 were unsuccessful.
In Dodd and Ruback’s (1977) study, 48 out of a
total of 172 tender offers were unsuccessful.
The number of such failures of
the market for acquisitions
could be more if merger and sell-off attempts
were also included.
We are not suggesting
that all these unsuccessful
acquisition
attempts are due to the adverse selection problem arising from
information
asymmetry,
but they are indicative
of the significant costs that
may be associated with asset transactions.

2.2. The joint-venture

solution

In lieu of an outright
acquisition,
firms can form a joint-venture
for
combining
complementary
assets. Transactions
governed by a joint-venture
will be efficient for the following reasons:
1. First, a joint-venture
unlike an acquisition,
avoids a terminal sale and
transfer of ownership rights and allows the partners to rescind the relationship at a relatively low cost. It can be structured as a mechanism
that allows
piece-mea1 transactions
and renegotiation
of compensation
for individual
contributions.
The possibility of repeated contracting
and termination
of the
relationship
under a joint-venture
can induce information
revelation
and
51t is important to distinguish between risk arising from uncertain prospects for a venture and
the adverse selection due to asymmetric
information.
Suppose
that the buyer has all the
information
that the seller has about the target assets. The buyer can efficiently share the
residual uncertainty
about the new venture (uncertainty
about demand for its products, for e.g.)
by selling the risky claims in the capital market. The price offered by the seller for the target
assets will be discounted
to reflect the premium charged for this risk. A rational seller should
accept this offer because it is the true (risk-adjusted)
value of his assets. If in addition, there is an
asymmetry
between the buyer’s and seller’s information
about the assets, the price offered for the
assets will be further discounted
to reflect this asymmetry.
The seller will refuse to sell in this
case because the offer price will fall short of his expectations.

<-----Page 5----->104

S. Balakrishnan, Information asymmetry, adverse selection and joint-ventures

mitigate the adverse selection problem. There may be short-term
gains from
misrepresentations,
but the threat of termination
of the joint-venture
or its
potential
liquidation
because of the resulting downstream
inefticiencies,
will
offset these gains and reduce the incentives to misrepresent.
2. Second, the joint-venture,
unlike a lease, introduces
for each parent
limited formal and informal property rights and obligations
by way of shared
ownership.
When the joint-venture
is formed as a partnership,
the parents
have a fiduciary responsibility
to each other. In incorporated
joint-ventures,
the members of the governing
board or the executive committee
who are
usually
drawn from both the parent
companies,
collectively
decide the
policies of the joint-venture.
They may also have limited rights to formally or
informally
audit and verify the claims and actions
of the parents
by
monitoring
the use of the assets of their respective parent companies
as well
as those of the partner. These features of a joint-venture,
unavailable
in a
pure contract such as a leasing agreement, help to reduced the incentives for
opportunistic
behavior in the joint-venture.
3. Finally, the joint-venture
affords opportunities
for learning and gathering new information
about the value of the partner’s assets. Some jointventures
explicitly
stipulate
a dissolution
date and many others end in
purchase by one of the parents. In such cases, monitoring
and auditing the
partner’s asset use facilitate the learning process and eventually,
the pricing
of those assets.
The joint-venture,
however, is not a costless mechanism
for combining
assets. Because of the absence of ‘unity of command’,
costly disputes over
sharing the gains from the venture are still a possibility.
Because of shared
control
and the lack of ‘unity of command’,
the administrative
costs of
managing
and controlling
the joint-venture
will be more than the corresponding costs for a hierarchy. Renegotiations
are also potentially
expensive.
Joint-venture
is thus a compromise
between a contract
and a hierarchy,
combining
some of their positive features, but not quite eliminating
their
negative features.

2.3. Empirical implications
Summing up the arguments
thus far, we note that strategic considerations
and the failure of the market for intermediate
products provide the incentives
for firms to seek lateral or vertical acquisitions.
On the other hand, the lack
of complete information
about the target assets may cause the market for
acquisition
to fail also. The less informed the partners to an asset transaction
are about each other’s businesses and the higher the perceived variance in
their valuation
of the assets, the greater is the likelihood of the failure of the

<-----Page 6----->S. Balakrishnan, Information asymmetry, adverse selection and joint-ventures

105

market for acquisition.
While a contractual
solution such as leasing may be
an option when the information
asymmetry
is severe, it introduces
other
transaction
costs by way of opportunistic
misuse of the leased assets. Under
these conditions,
the joint-venture
can emerge as a superior substitute
for
both contract and acquisition.
A testable implication
is that , ceteris paribus,
the shareholders
should expect greater gains from joint ventures when the
primary business operations
of the parents are dissimilar such that they are
not capable of appraising
the value of each other’s technology
and assets.
Our main hypothesis is therefore:
Hypothesis 1. Shareholder reactions to the unanticipated announcement of
joint-ventures will be positively correlated with the extent to which the primary
business operations of the parent companies are dissimilar.
Hypothesis
(1) calls for careful interpretation.
The investors will respond
more favorably
to joint-ventures
between parents in dissimilar
businesses
because joint-venture
is the minimum
cost mechanism
for coordinating
synergistic
assets in this case. Outright
acquisition
of the target assets is
costlier because of the valuation
problem. If the parent firms’ management
fails to choose the most efficient mechanism
the market may construe that
the management
is either inefficient or self-serving and penalize its choice.
The hypothesis
is independent
of the size of the synergistic value created
by joint-ventures
and acquisitions.
We expect value creation, which is the
motive for combining
the assets, in both joint-ventures
and acquisitions.
Likewise, the dissimilarity
of the parents’ business may reduce synergy in
both joint-ventures
and acquisitions.
The difference is only in the costs of
information
asymmetry
and adverse
selection
that are exacerbated
by
dissimilarity.
The degree of synergy between the assets is not pertinent to the
arguments
about
the relative efficiency of the different
mechanisms
for
combining
the assets, which leads us to our second hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2. On an average, investors in parent firms, anticipating significant
gains from combining their complementary assets, will react favourably to jointventure announcements.
The third hypothesis
follows from several discussions
in the literature
on
collusion and gains from market power as possible motives of joint-ventures.
These motives do not explain why joint-venture
is preferred when a merger
or a contract between the parent firms could have also accomplished
similar
results. In fact, with the exception
of the joint R&D ventures, anti-trust
policies had treated mergers and joint-ventures
equivalently
[Brodley (1976)].
Although
theoretically
plausible,
previous empirical
evidence for collusion
and market power related gains from joint-ventures
has been mixed and

J.E.B.0

F

<-----Page 7----->106

S. Balakrishnan, Information asymmetry, adverse selection and joint-ventures

inconclusive
[Berg and Friedman
(1980); Boyle (1968); Duncan (1982); Mead
(1967); Ordover and Willig (1985); Pfeffer and Nowak (1976); Vickers (1985)].
Ceteris paribus, such gains are most likley when the parent firms are in the
same industry, but in such a case shareholders
will anticipate an acquisition.
Therefore, if there are any monopoly
related gains, they will be offset by the
negative reaction to the choice of joint-venture.
Therefore:
Hypothesis 3. On an average, shareholder reactions to joint-ventures
between
parent companies whose principal businesses are in the same industry will either
be less favorable
than or not different from
their reactions
to other
joint-ventures.
To test these hypotheses,
we assess shareholder
reactions to joint-venture
announcements
by using the standard
event study method which has been
widely
used in finance
literature
to evaluate
corporate
mergers
and
acquisitions.

3. Methodology
3.1. Evaluation

of investor reactions

The event study method involves estimating
the abnormal
returns, if any,
to the parent company’s
common
stock holders when the stock price has
adjusted to the new information
revealed by the announcement
[Fama et al.
(1969)]. In the standard event study method, the market model is first used
to predict the normal returns to the common stock of a firm:
Ri, = ai + PiRmt + Eitr
where Ri,= the return of firm i in period t, R,t= the return on value/equally
weighted market portfolio of securities in period t, cli and pi =lirm specific
parameters, sit = random error m N(0, ai).
The model parameters
are estimated using the monthly or daily firm and
market returns for an estimation
period preceding some discrete, unanticipated events (e.g., announcement
of mergers, joint-ventures
etc.). The deviations of the actual returns
from the predicted
returns
on the relevant
securities - the abnormal
returns - for a conventionally
chosen event period
around
the event date but falling outside the estimation
period, are then
computed from:
AR,, = Ri, -(pi + ~iR,t),
where B and fl are the ordinary

least squares

estimates

of the parameters

of

<-----Page 8----->S. Balakrishnan, Information asymmetry, adverse selection and joint-ventures

the market model. These abnormal
returns are then averaged over a large
sample of firms affected by similar events to cancel out the effect of
extraneous
noise:

where N is the number
of parent firms in the sample.
abnormal
return (CAR) over any interval [tr,tJ
is obtained

The cumulative
from,

CAR [tI, t,] = gm,

where, t, and t, are the beginning
and ending month of the period over
which
the cross-sectional
average
returns
are cumulated.
AR,
and
CAR [tI, t2] form the basic statistics for evaluating
the investor reactions to
the event. A statistically
significant positive average return or CAR indicates
that the event has a positive impact on the return on the stocks of the firms
affected by the event. Event studies assume that the capital market
is
informationally
efficient. In its weak form, this means that the market adjusts
instantaneously
to publicly available information.
The event study method is
simple to use and has proved to be quite powerful and robust in evaluating
discrete events affecting firms. Even though the joint-venture
formation
may
is
extend over a long time - it often does - the event study method
appropriate
if the pre-announcement
negotiation
is not public information.6

3.2. Sample and data
To evaluate investor reactions to the announcement
of joint-ventures,
we
constructed
a sample of joint-ventures
from the quarterly joint-venture
roster
published in Mergers and Acquisitions during the four year period 1974-1977.
The period was chosen to take advantage
of industry data from the FTC
Line of Business Reports, 1974-1977, which the authors are using in other
concurrent
research projects on joint-ventures.
The following criteria were
used to select the sample:
‘A number of studies in finance, strategy and other areas have employed the event study
method to evaluate investor reactions merger announcements
[see Jensen and Ruback (1983)
and Weston and Chung (1983) for a review of several event studies of acquisitions].
Protracted
negotiations
and anticipation
is a problem in all these studies but not a serious one, provided
appropriate
precautions
are undertaken.
Also, see Brown and Warner
(1980, 1985) for an
assessment
of the statistical
power of the event study method
and the associated
tests in
successfully detecting abnormal returns from unanticipated
events.

monthly returns file of the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRISP)
at the University
of Chicago, for a period covering 72 months before and
including the month of the announcement

Our final sample consisted
of 64 joint-ventures
and 85 parent companies
which satisfied the screening
criteria. Table 1 lists the number
of jointventures and parent companies
in the sample for each year. For each of the

The Z-statistic
for this return was significant at the 0.01 level
and therefore the null hypothesis of no significant gains from combining
the
complementary
assets of the parent companies
in a joint-venture
can be
rejected.8

Because of sample bias that may arise due to
the inclusion
of both parents in 21 of the 64 joint-ventures,
we divided the
sample into two sub-samples:
(i) one randomly
selected parent from each of
the 21 joint-centures
(N=21),
and (ii) all the remaining
parents (N= 64).”

These results broadly
support
Hypothesis
(2).
Shareholders
realize significant
gains from joint-ventures,
a result which is
consistent with previous results obtained by McConnell
and Nantell (1985).
Of primary interest to us is whether the investors react more favorably to
joint-ventures
between parents operating in dissimilar businesses. To investigate the relationship
between joint-venture
efficiency and parent dissimilarity
and test Hypothesis
2. we constructed
a simple measure of the ‘distance’
between the primary
businesses
of the parent companies.
The measure is
based on the 3-digit SIC’s of the parent firms of the jth joint-venture,
normalized
over the maximum possible distance:

Greater
the distance,
more dissimilar
the businesses
are. Admittedly,
the
3-digit SIC codes are crude and may not reveal much about how the jointventure assets relates to the parent firms. To minimize potential
error that
may arise due to mis-classification,
the authors and their research assistants
collected details about the nature and scope of the joint venture’s and the
parent’s businesses. In each case, a consensus classitication
was sought which
was consistent with the reported SIC classification.
Those joint-ventures
that
did not pass this scrutiny were excluded from the sample. Also, recognizing
the limitations
that may arise from the use of nominally
scaled SIC codes in
the construction
of the distance measure, we used a rank transformation
of
the distance as an alternate independent
variable to test the hypothesis.

<-----Page 12----->S. Balakrishnan, Information

We expect the abnormal
returns obtained by investors from joint-venture
announcements
to increase with the distance between the parent companies.
If we regressed the abnormal
return for the event month for each parent
company
on the corresponding
distance, the slope should be positive. To
correct for possible heteroscedasticity,
we first standardized
the abnormal
return for each parent company i [Brown and Warner (1985)]:

t=
J
-13

where gi=

(=C71 (ARi,-ARi)2/60.

The standardized
abnormal
return for the announcement
month for each
parent company
in the sample was than regressed on the corresponding
distance or its rank transformation.
As before, we divided the sample into
two sub-samples
of 21 and 64 parent firms and estimated the slopes for each
sub-sample.
Because the error terms in the two samples
may not be
independent
in 21 observations
we used Seemingly
Unrelated
Regression
(SUR) for unequal
samples [Judge et al. (1980)]. The Generalized
Least
Squares (GLS) estimates from these regressions
are summarized
in table 3.
The coefficient for the distance
as well as its rank transformation
were
positive in all regressions
and significant
at the 0.10 level or above for the
sub-sample
of 64 parents.
We interpret
these results as supporting
our
hypothesis
that investors
react more favorably
to the announcements
of
joint-ventures
between parents in dissimilar businesses.
To test the third hypothesis
that joint-ventures
facilitate collusion
and
result in significant gains in monopoly
power for the parents, we divide the
64 joint-ventures
into two portfolios
based on the parents’ primary
businesses: (i) the monopoly
portfolio of 11 joint-ventures
in which the parent
firms’ businesses
were within the same 4- or 3-digit SIC and (ii) the
remaining
53 joint-ventures
which we call the non-monopoly
portfolio.”
The average abnormal
returns, CAR’s and the cross-sectional
variances for
the two portfolios are reported in table 4. The average abnormal
return for
the announcement
month
for the monopoly
portfolio
was positive
but
insignificant.
For the non-monopoly
portfolio of joint-ventures
the average
“See Caves et al. (1980, 199-200) for a measure of ‘distance’ between businesses based on
their SIC’s which takes a value of zero if the 4-digit SIC’s of the two parent were within the
same 3-digit SIC, a value of one if they were in different 3-digit SIC’s but the same 2-digit SIC’s,
and a value of two if they were in different two digit SIC’s In our sample there was just one
joint-venture
for which this distance had a value of 1, that is, the parent companies
primary
businesses were in different 3-digit SIC’s but the same 2-digit SIC. This rather small sample
problem forced us to form two portfolios instead of three, if we had followed the Caves et al.
measure strictly.

abnormal
return to the parents was positive and significant at the 0.01 level.
The t-statistic
for the difference between the two averages was positive in
favor of the non-monopoly
portfolio and significant
at the 0.01 level. The
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
rank test statistic for the difference between the
two sub-samples
was also positive but not significant. Over longer intervals,
however, the cumulative
average returns for the two portfolios did not show
any significant differences.
The CAR’s are plotted in fig. 2. The CAR’s for both the groups increase
month. The CAR’s for the monopoly
from tc12 to t,, the announcement
portfolio
are generally
lower than those for the non-monopoly
portfolio
during the period t _ 12 to t,. Taken together, these results seem to reject
collusion as the primary motive for joint-ventures.
Noting that the distance between the parent companies
in the monopoly
joint-ventures
is zero, and that this may be a potential source of distortion
in
the regressions for testing Hypothesis (l), we replicated these regressions with
a dummy variable (MONO) which took the value of 1 if the parent belonged
to the same 3-digit SIC and zero otherwise. Table 3 reports the results of
these regressions.
The results are generally
stronger
than those from the
restricted model. The coefficients of the distance and its rank transformation
were both positive and significant in both the sub-samples.
The coefficient for
the dummy
variable
is positive in all regressions
and significant
for the
smaller sub-sample.
This is somewhat at variance with the results from the
portfolio method and the discrepancy
is perhaps due to small samples. In
any case, given that the joint-ventures
in the sample had passed the scrutiny
of anti-trust
agencies, these results should be interpreted
conservatively.
Much as we would like to consider the results for our main hypothesis

<-----Page 15----->114

S. Balakrishnan, Information asymmetry, adverse selection and joint-ventures

regarding
the positive relationship
between abnormal
returns and dissimilarity of parents’ businesses as conclusive, the shortcomings
in the methodology arising from our measure of dissimilarity
of businesses
require us to
interpret
the resuolts with caution.
First, we note that the measure was
constructed
with 3-digit Standard
Industrial
Classification
which is based
primarily
on production
technologies.
The measure,
therefore,
captures
mainly the potential
information
asymmetry
that arises from the parents’
involvement
in dissimilar
production
technologies.
In principle,
a better
proxy can be constructed
with more information
about past transactions
and
other forms of relationships
between the joint-venture
parents. Much of this
information,
however, is proprietary
and difficult to obtain.
Second, to the extent that the distance measure reflects potential
competition between the parents in their core markets, the methodology
admits
alternative
interpretations
of our main result that joint-ventures
between
similar parents are less favorably
received than those betweeen dissimilar
parents. One interpretation
is that when the parent businesses are in adjacent
markets, the likelihood
of future conflicts between them is more, increasing
the costs of administering
the joint-venture
successfully. This may indeed be
so and it tempers our enthusiasm
about the results which may have little to
do with the costs of adverse selection in asset transactions.
An alternative
interpretation
that favours our theory is that the market’s poor response to a
joint-ventures
between parents in similar businesses is because acquisition
is
expected to be the least cost mechanism
for realizing synergies in this case.
The parent
firms are penalized
when they fail to fulfill the market’s
expectations
of an acquisition
when in fact a joint-venture
is formed.
Finally, analysis of this sort does not lend itself to direct comparison
of
market’s reactions had the firms merged instead of forming a joint-venture.
The problem is discussed by Masten, Meehan and Snyder (1988), who have
suggested an approach for estimating the costs of the unobservable
organizational
form, using switching
regression.
Lack of minimal
information
required
and idiosyncracies
of our research
design do not permit
the
application
of the method suggested by Masten et al. Although true counterfactual information
is unobtainable,
it will still be useful to know how the
market
reacts to announcements
of mergers between firms in dissimilar
businesses.
A negative relationship
between abnormal
returns from merger
announcements
and the dissimilarity
index will be consistent with our theory
and increase our confidence in Hypothesis (1).
To test this, we selected a sample of 165 mergers
and acquisitions
announced
during the same period, 19741977.
The selection criteria were
similar to those for the joint-ventures.
Because merger announcement
dates
can be more precisely identified, we used daily returns for this analysis. The
regression results are reported in table 5.

distance is negative, but significant
only for the smaller sub-samples
which
comprised entirely of acquired firms. These results are consistent with earlier
studies that had examined
the relationship
between abnormal
returns and
relatedness
in merger and acquisitions
[Singh and Montgomery
(1987);
Shelton (1988)]. The negative relationship
suggests that the market reactions
are relatively more adverse for announcements
of mergers between dissimilar
firms. The opposite
relationships
for the joint-venture
and the merger
announcements
strengthen
our confidence in our main hypothesis as well as
the robustness of the dissimilarity
measure.

5. Conclusion
Earlier
studies
of joint-ventures
have likened
them to mergers
and
acquisitions,
as a mechanism for realizing synergies, collusion or risk-sharing.
Our theory is that the joint-venture
is a mechanism
for pooling complementary assets without having to resort to a terminal sale and redistribution
of
ownership
and control rights over these assets. Such non-terminal
mechanisms will be efficient when the market for acquisitions
fails due to the
asymmetry
between the seller’s and buyer’s information
about the target
assets. This is most likely when the parents operate in dissimilar businesses.
Our theory is supported
by the evidence based on investors’ reactions to

<-----Page 17----->116

Information

asymmetry,

adverse selection

and joint-ventures

joint-venture
and acquisition
announcements.
In an event study of 64
joint-venture
announcements,
we observed
that the shareholders
of the
parent
companies
involved
in these joint-ventures
obtained
significantly
larger abnormal
returns when these companies
were engaged in businesses
which were further apart in a technological
and managerial
sense. Although
value is created in all joint-ventures,
the shareholders
seem to favor jointventures between parents engaged in dissimilar
businesses. We found quite
the opposite relationship
between abnormal
returns and dissimilarity
in the
case of mergers
and acquisitions.
Both the acquirers
and target firms
obtained
larger abnormal
returns when their businesses
were similar, the
targets, more significantly
so. We interpret these results to mean that while
both joint-ventures
and acquisitions
may yield synergistic
gains to shareholders, there are non-trivial
differences between the two mechanisms.
Under
specific conditions
one may be superior to the other. Besides the obvious
implications
for management’s
choice between acquisition
and joint-venture,
the theory and empirical results should also be of interest to policy makers
in the areas of anti-trust
and inter-firm cooperation
