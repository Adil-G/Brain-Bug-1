Speed- and Online Dating: Insights into Preference Construction in Frequent, High
Involvement, Personal Decisions
Itamar Simonson, Stanford University

SESSION OVERVIEW
A central question in research on decision making refers to the
drivers and evolution of consumer preferences and the correspondence between actual consumer decisions and what consumers say
and believe about the drivers of their decisions. This question will
be examined in the proposed session in the context of a very
personal and often rather important decision-choosing a date. Both
speed dating events and online dating involve repeated choices and
thus allow for a more dynamic perspective on decision making and
the manner in which preferences evolve over time. Thus, the
proposed session will provide new insights into preference construction from a more dynamic perspective than prior research.
Furthermore, all three papers are based on field studies (e.g., speed
dating events) and involve real dating decisions.
The first paper, by Frost and Ariely, focuses on the important
topic of preference learning, which poses a challenge to consumer
researchers because in most cases the learning process is slow and
thus unsuitable for laboratory experiments. Frost and Ariely examine the ability of people to learn and update their preferences by
learning from the prior successes and failures of their online dating
decisions. The research is based on secondary data from a major
online dating service as well as on a field experiment that is being
conducted in collaboration with that online dating service. The
dataset they rely on makes it possible to examine how dating
preferences evolve over time. For example. Frost and Ariely
examine what online daters look for in terms of physical features
(attractiveness, body type, and age), soon after they joined the
online dating service, and how their preferences changed over time.
Also, in the study being conducted, they examine the impact of
forcing participants to define their preferences more carefully on
their online dating success rate.
The second paper, by Iyengar, Simonson, and Fisman, examines the relation between what people say is important to them when
selecting a date and what actually drives their dating decisions in a
speed-dating event. Previous research has shown that there is a
significant gap between stated attribute importance and actual
decisions, with the correlation between the two often quite low
(e.g., Slovic and Lichtenstein, 1971), and various explanation for
the discrepancy between stated and revealed attribute importance
have been offered (e.g., Barlas 2003). Prior research has implicitly
assumed that the relation between stated importance beliefs and
actual attribute importance derived from choices people make
(hereafter, revealed attribute importance) is rather stable over time.
The present investigation examines whether the gap between stated
attribute preference and revealed attribute importance fluctuates
over time based on the two-way feedback between stated preferences and revealed preferences.
This research, based on a series of actual speed-dating events,
generated important new insights regarding the relation between
stated and revealed preferences. Furthermore, the research revealed
a series of important differences, related to attribute observability
and gender, with respect to the dynamic relations between stated
and revealed preferences. Also, consistent with prior work by
Iyengar and Lepper (2000), thefindingsindicate that the correlation
between prior stated preferences and revealed preferences is higher
when the speed dating event involves fewer decisions, though this

relation reverses after the event (i.e., the correlation between
revealed preferences and stated preferences after the event is higher
among those who had participated in speed dating events with more
dates). Finally, a series of findings suggest that men and women
recognize that their stated importance weights often differ from
their actual attribute weights.
The third paper, by Raghunathan and Walker, further examines the drivers of judgments and preferences about dates, again in
the context of speed dating. In particular, building on prior work
regarding judgments that are based on "thin slices" (e.g., Ambady
et al. 1993,2000), they propose that nonverbal cues play a key role
in evaluations of dates. Consistent with the research by Iyengar et
al. (the second paper in this session), Raghunathan and Walker
argue that the limited insight of men and women with respect to
their own preferences makes them particularly susceptible to influence by less conscious, nonverbal aspects.
Study 1, which is currently being conducted in collaboration
with a professional speed-dating organization, will involve two
stages. In the first stage, participants will be videotaped as they are
having a speed date with opposite-sex confederates. In the second
stage, the videotaped dates will be edited and subsequently coded
by groups of independent judges assigned to focus on different
dimensions (such as personality, attractiveness, etc.). Among others, it is expected that the personality ratings of targets—which are
known to correlate significantly with nonverbal cues (cf. Ambady
1993)—will be highly correlated with targets' date-worthiness
ratings. In the second study, we will assess whether targets who
elicit "bad" ratings on the nonverbal dimension and "good" ratings
on other dimensions (physical attractiveness, earning potential) are
better off presenting the latter type of information to potential dates
first (e.g., through email, telephone conversation, etc.) before
meeting them face-to-face.
We believe that this session will be of much interest to a broad
audience, not only because of the intrinsic interest of dating
decisions, but because this unique decision category provides
important insights into dynamic aspects of decision making in an
area of great personal significance. Furthermore, because in such
domains people may often be unaware of the drivers of their
preferences and/or be unwilling to admit what drives their preferences, observing actual behavior in speed and online dating can
provide valuable insights regarding the processes involved in
preference construction.

The objective of this research is to assess the relative weight
men and women place on nonverbal cues versus other types of cues
in assessing the dateworthiness of others they have met for a short
(less than five minute) time. Evidence from thin-slice research (e.g.,
Ambady and Rosenthal, 1992, 1993; Walker and Raghunathan
2004)—a thin slice can be defined as "a brief excerpt of expressive
[nonverbal] behavior sampled from the behavioral stream" (e.g.,
Ambady, Bemieri, and Richeson 2000, p. 203)—suggests that
nonverbal cues will have a significant impact on judgments of

potential dates. However, there is cause to believe that judgers may
rely less on nonverbal cues in dating (versus other types of) contexts
since the context of judging others as potential dates (as opposed to
that of judging them as teachers or as salespeople) is, arguably,
more involving. As a result, judgers may explicitly attempt to
weight nonverbal cues "appropriately" or to even discount them
when judging potential dates, since giving importance to nonverbal
cues may be seen as irrational or even inhuman. Further, previous
relevant research has not revealed evidence for use of nonverbal
cues in dating contexts; findings reveal, rather, that while men find
"physical attractiveness" desirable, women find "eaming potential" desirable (e.g., Davis 1990; Deaux and Hanna 1984).
In sum, it is unclear whether and to what extent we may expect
nonverbal cues (versus other cues) to influence judgments of the
dateworthiness of potential dates. Towards addressing this question, we conducted a study consisting of two stages. In the first
stage, five men and five women at a speed dating party were
videotaped as they were engaged in a conversation with oppositesex confederates. After the targets completed their speed dates with
the other party participants, we gathered data on how many of the
opposite-sex participants wished to see these targets again. In the
second stage, videotapes of these target dates were shown to
undergraduate students participating in a study for extra credit. One
set of the undergrads was exposed to the full three minute video of
the targets, containing both verbal and nonverbal cues, and asked to
rate the targets' eaming potential, how fun-loving they were, and
their sincerity and commitment. A second set was asked to rate
targets on their personalities on the basis of exposure to 30-second
video clips with the sound removed. Silent clips were used to
eliminate contextual and verbal cues were, thus forcing the judger
to rely solely on nonverbal cues. On the basis of Ambady and
Rosenthal 's (1993) findings, we expected these personality ratings
to be significantly correlated with the target's nonverbal cues, that
is, we expected that targets with "good" nonverbal cues would elicit
more positive personality ratings than those with "bad" nonverbal
cues. A third set of undergrads rated the target's physical attractiveness, based on a still photograph of them.
Then, a step-wise regression was conducted, using target's
personality ratings (based on silent video), their perceived eaming
potential, fun-loving nature, and sincerity/commitment (based on
the full video), and their physical attractiveness (based on the
photograph) as predictor variables and their dateworthiness
(operationalized as the number of participants from the speed
dating party who wished to see the target again) as the dependent
variable. Results indicated that physical attractiveness and nonverbal cues were more significant predictors of the targets'
dateworthiness than were their perceived eaming potential, sincerity/commitment, and fun-loving nature. These results are consistent with our thesis.
Given the evidence (from study 1) that nonverbal cues play a
significant role in influencing perceptions of dateworthiness, it is
important to assess how one should present oneself to a potential
suitor: should one expose the suitor to one's nonverbal cues first
(e.g., by meeting them face-to-face or by exposing them to one's
video file), or should one first expose others to one's verbal profile
(e.g., a description of one's personality, likes/dislikes, etc.) first?
To address this question, subjects were randomly assigned to
one of the following 16 conditions; 2 (Nonverbal cues first vs.
Profile first) X 2 (Valence of Nonverbal Cues: Good vs. Bad) X 2
(Valence of Profile: Good vs. Bad) X 2 (Target gender: Male vs.
Female). That is, male and female subjects saw targets with good or
bad video and good or bad verbal profiles, with the profiles or the
videos coming first. After each exposure (video and verbal profile),
subjects were asked to rate the target. The overall rating (second

rating minus the first rating) and the overall positivity ofthe second
rating were used as the dependent variables. Results indicated that
a better overall impression is created with exposure to video first
than with exposure to profile first when both the nonverbal cues and
the profile are good. Exposure to a bad video and then to a good
profile produces a far better impression than the reverse, perhaps
because of contrast effects, or perhaps because there is a penalty for
presenting misleading infonnation. Finally, a bad video followed
by a bad profile produces a worse impression then a bad profile
followed by a bad video. Thus, overall, if a target has good
nonverbal cues, these should be exposed first. If however, the target
has bad nonverbal cues, these should be exposed later (unless the
profile is contrastingly good). Interestingly, women rating women
were generally very forgiving of a bad video and of a bad profile,
perhaps because such presentations are seen as a sign of honesty.
Male participants did not show this effect.

Counts"

The gap between stated attribute importance and actual decisions has been well documented and interpreted as a sign of poor
insight into one's decision process (for a review, see, e.g., Barlas
2003). Goldstein, Barlas, and Beattie (2001) showed that attribute
importance is interpreted differently depending on people's communicative goals. And Barlas (2003) has recently proposed that the
goal to justify decisions infiuences (stated) importance beliefs more
than choices whereas the goal to accurately assess preferences
infiuences choices more.
Prior research has implicitly assumed that the relation between
stated importance beliefs and actual attribute importance derived
from choices people make (hereafter, revealed attribute importance) is rather stable over time. In a typical study, subjects are
asked to state their attribute importance (e.g., by allocating 100
points among attributes), and they also make choices, which can be
used to derive the revealed importance weights. However, it is

<-----Page 2----->Advances in Consumer Research (Votume 32) 1187
reasonable to expect that the degree of correspondence between
importance beliefs and revealed attribute importance fiuctuate over
time.
In the present research, based on actual speed dating events
conducted at Columbia University (with mostly graduate students),
we examined the dynamics ofthe relationship between importance
beliefs and revealed attribute importance weights by measuring the
gap between the two at three points in time. First, we measured
importance beliefs prior to making choices. Next, respondents
made repeated decisions as part of a "speed dating" event in which
they participated, followed by a second measurement of importance
beliefs. Finally, three weeks later, they again indicated their importance beliefs. In addition, the revealed importance weights were
derived from the actual choices, which allows us to track the
relationship between importance beliefs and actual behavior over
time.
The speed dating context provided a particularly rich environment for studying the determinants of consumer preferences. Among
others, we focused on the impact of attribute type, the choice set
size, and gender differences (building on a very large literature
regarding mate selection). Since actual attribute importance is
likely to depend on the available information, it was expected that
the revealed attribute weights would be different from the importance beliefs stated prior to the event. For example, although
women may consider sincerity more important than shared interests
when evaluating prospective dates, the difficulty of assessing
sincerity in a four-minute speed date is likely to shift the revealed
importance weights in favor ofthe more easily assessed attribute of
shared interests. Such changes in actual importance were expected
to be reflected in importance beliefs measured soon after the
repeated choice event, but that effect was predicted to be shortlived, with the previously held importance beliefs re-emerging after
some time. These predictions were supported in the studies we
conducted.
The results also showed that the correlation between stated and
revealed preferences is higher when the speed dating event involves
10 rather than 20 dates, but the correlation between the two after the
event was higher in those who had had 20 dates. Furthermore,
whereas men give the same proportion of "Yes" (i.e., express
interest in going on a regular date) regardless ofthe number of dates,
women become more selective and select about the same number of
dates in speed dating events with 10 dates and with 20 dates. These
differences are consistent with the evolutionary psychological and
social status perspectives of mate selection. Finally, a series of tests
conducted as a part of a follow-up study indicate that men and
women recognize that their stated importance weights differ from
their actual (revealed) attribute weights, though they underestimate
the magnitude of that gap.

Over time and with experience, consumers leam, change, and
refine their preferences. Familiar examples are cases where consumers start by liking one type of food and years later end up liking
another. For example, very few like heavy beers early in their

drinking experience, but many do end up liking such beers later on.
The same hold true, for example, for spicy foods, jazz, and even
wine. Despite its importance, preference leaming poses a challenge
to consumer researchers because in most cases the leaming process
is slow (which makes it unsuitable for laboratory experiments), and
there is no readily available data to examine such leaming processes. In the current work, we examine the leaming process in one
domain-online dating-an activity that was common to about 40
million Americans last August [1]. The dataset we have, provided
by a major online dating service, allows us to examine how
preferences evolve in response to participants' successes and failures and the impact of performance (e.g., getting dates) on their
preferences.
In ourfirstset of analyses ofthe leaming process, we examined
what online daters look for in terms of physical features (attractiveness, body type, and age), soon after they joined the online dating
service. We then follow how their preferences changed over time.
For example, we see that early on in the online dating experience the
"ideal" woman tends to be in her late twenties to early thirties while
the "ideal" man for most women is in his early 4O's. The difficulty
of course is that the supply of these two popular types is below the
demand, and thus most of those who are looking exclusively for
these age groups are unsuccessful.
The online dating panel data allow us also to test the ability of
online daters to leam who is likely to positively respond to them and
who is likely to be a good fit. For example, we examined whether
the (importance) weight online daters place on the attraction indicators (attractiveness, body type, and age) seem to decrease or
increase over time, suggesting some leaming based on their past
success. Somewhat disappointing, the results show very little
leaming, suggesting that wishful thinking can overcome reality.
We also identified a few pattems (or segments) of behaviors that we
term spammers (online daters who send email indiscriminately),
jugglers (online daters who have simultaneous relationships with
many others), and passive daters (online daters who wait for others
to email them). Again somewhat disappointing, the results show
very little leaming aside from general disheartening with the online
dating service as a whole. An interesting question that arises from
these results concems the limited ability of online daters to leam
how to increase their success rates. We provide some speculations
about the nature of this limited ability to leam.
A different approach to examine the ability of online daters to
leam how to better predict preference and success in email as well
as physical dates relates to the possibility that the nature of the
online dating market is such that it encourages behaviors that are
ultimately self-defeating. In particular the temptation to send many
people email and the free cost of these emails could promote lack
of discriminating emails, lack of leaming, and the spamming we see
in our data. To test this idea, in collaboration with the online dating
site (that provided the data), we are introducing a program that
limits the number of emails members can send to others; this will
allow us to test whether a market with a stmcture that causes people
to think more carefully about who they send email to will force them
to define their preferences and tactics more carefully and accurately
and, ultimately, improve their success rate. Specifically, we will
give some people a limited supply of introductory emails that we
call virtual roses. The number of virtual roses will vary on three
levels, with the high restriction of only 2 emails a month, a lower
restriction with 8 emails a month, and a low level of restriction with
100 emails a month. This experiment will test whether, under more
limiting market conditions, individuals are better able to judge their
probability of success and leam what is most important for them. To
the extent that this approach improves online dating, we could
conclude that the temptations in the current market structure are just

too high and limit the ability of online daters to maximize their
chances of corresponding and dating. This experiment started
running in Early March and should be completed by May or June.
