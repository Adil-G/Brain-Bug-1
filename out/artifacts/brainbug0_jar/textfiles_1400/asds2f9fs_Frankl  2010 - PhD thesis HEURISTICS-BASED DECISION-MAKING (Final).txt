Abstract
In this dissertation, I study the use of tacit and explicit business heuristics in decisionmaking in small and medium Canadian businesses. I confirm the use of heuristics in business
decision- making, present some common business heuristics identified in the study, and propose
methods of making the application of heuristics more useful for better decision- making in
various business situations.
Although business decision-making has been a subject of research in big corporations,
investigating decision-making using tacit and implicit business heuristics remains limited in
small and medium businesses. A method for organizing and compiling various forms of
decision-making using these types of business heuristics can deliver significant benefits to small
and medium businesses.
I define a heuristic (sometimes referred to as rule of thumb) to be a description of an
informal or formal problem-solving process, not necessarily 100% reliable.
Some examples of business heuristics include "Apply 5 times sales for business
valuation," and "Ensure the client is given a meaningful and prompt response." The first

heuristic contains enough information for a competent business executive to make a business
decision; I call this first type of heuristic an explicit business heuristic; the second heuristic
requires additional knowledge to make a business decision; in particular, the decision-maker
needs to know what "a meaningful and prompt response" entails in order to make the decision. I
call this second type of heuristic a tacit business heuristic.
My research involved a group of Vancouver Island executives participating in an online
survey on the use of heuristics in business decision-making. Two main conclusions resulting
from this research are that executives apply extensively various forms of business heuristics
when solving business problems, and that the heuristics they use are both tacit and explicit. A
review of heuristics scholarship and my 25-year business experience as a senior executive with
small and medium Canadian companies support these results.
I propose a set of what-how rules that can assist in converting tacit business heuristics
into explicit ones by expanding their information content. Finally, I recommend follow-up
research for the development of tacit knowledge transfer methods using business heuristics.

HEURISTICS BASED DECISION-MAKING IN SMALL
AND MEDIUM CANADIAN BUSINESSES

In this dissertation, I study the use of tacit and explicit business heuristics as a method for
better decision-making in small and medium Canadian businesses. I confirm the use of heuristics
in business decision- making, present a list of common business heuristics identified in the study,
and propose methods of making the application of heuristics more useful for better decisionmaking in various business situations.

Chapter 1: Overview
The challenge small and medium business executives face is that of making better
business decisions. Currently business executives make decisions using gut feel, common sense,
intuition, experience, and, often without knowing it, various forms of heuristics or rules of thumb
(Gigerenzer, 2007).
Over the past 25 years, as a senior executive of several small and medium Canadian hitech businesses, I noticed that the decision-making process I have applied was often based on
personal experience. Discussing this decision-making process with colleagues possessing similar
business backgrounds confirms that most business executives I talked with rely on personal
experience when solving challenging business problems. Of course, I could not always share
with others, especially the competition, the specifics of the problems facing my businesses.
Therefore, we were sharing solutions to common business situations like government red tape,
tax matters, or external political and economical influences on our businesses.

<-----Page 13----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

There is no substitute for years of experience in any human endeavour. However, tapping
into some of the principles and lessons learned from my personal experience as well as that of
my colleagues can result in useful methods for others to follow, especially for entrepreneurs
interested in building their own businesses. Therefore, a method for organizing and compiling
various forms of decision-making methods could deliver significant benefits by improving the
decision-making process of executives in small and medium businesses.

1.1

Heuristic, a Definition
I introduce in this section definitions of heuristics, tacit and explicit knowledge, tacit and

explicit heuristics, and quantitative and qualitative heuristics.
I define a heuristic (sometimes referred as a rule of thumb) to be the description of a
problem- solving process that is not necessarily 100% reliable.
In other words, heuristics are rules, not necessarily readily generalized and not
necessarily always correct; they are practical principles with wide application, not necessarily
strictly accurate. Some heuristics communicate clear, concise, and understandable processes,
whereas others sound incomplete, fuzzy, and even incomprehensible because they assume
unspecified additional knowledge. Heuristics can nevertheless provide helpful decision-making
guidelines for business executives when problem-solving or decision-making, especially when
critical information is missing (Gigerenzer, 2008).
Following Polanyi, I define tacit knowledge as knowledge that one cannot express
completely; hence, tacit knowledge is difficult to communicate. Polanyi wrote, "We know more
than we can tell" (Polanyi, 1967). For example, most of us can recognize a familiar face in a
crowd; however, if asked how we achieve this recognition, we would not be able to describe the

<-----Page 14----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

3

process in a clear way. Conversely, I define explicit knowledge as knowledge one can
communicate to another person completely with no need of further interpretation.
Similar to the above definitions of tacit and explicit knowledge, I define tacit and explicit
business heuristics as follows:
- An explicit business heuristic is a clear, concise heuristic, understandable by any
competent business executive. Explicit business heuristics involving quantitative data are called
quantitative business heuristics.
For example, the heuristic in the previous section ("Apply 5 times sales for business
valuation") contains enough information for a business executive to make a decision; it is
therefore, an explicit business heuristic.
- A tacit business heuristic requires additional unspecified knowledge to carry it out.
Tacit business heuristics often use qualitative information to convey their message. They are also
called qualitative business heuristics.
For example, "Ensure the client is given a meaningful and prompt response," requires
knowing what "a meaningful and prompt response" means.
Heuristic-based problem-solving methods are present extensively in business, the
military, games (including sports), medicine, computer science, economics, statistics, arts,
academic research, engineering, history, rhetoric, law, agriculture, religion, politics, science,
fashion, education, psychology, and philosophy. (Not an exhaustive list).
For instance, in AI (Artificial Intelligence), a heuristic is a strategy for problem-solving
that uses rules to select what is hopefully the best solution. In the construction of scientific
theories, heuristics may take the form of rules-of-thumbs, procedures, or even research

<-----Page 15----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

methodologies.

1.2

Various Meaning of Heuristics
When examining the various meanings of the word heuristics, I notice that heuristics

have often vague, even contradictory definitions in the present literature. To many people, the
meaning of the word heuristic varies depending on the situation to which one applies it. For
example, a heuristic method is a trial-and-error-based problem-solving process, applicable in
psychology (Duncker, 1945), mathematics (Pólya, 1957), astrophysics, (Zwicky_in_Wild, 1989),
and philosophy of science (Sebestik, 2007).
The most common definitions of heuristics (which do not mirror mine) contain the words
invention or discovery. Additional interpretations of heuristics include trial and error handling,
problem-solving, unstructured proof, incremental exploration, learning from experience,
comparison to previously recognized patterns, intelligent guesswork, speculative formulation,
investigative discovery, conducive discovery, rules of thumb, algorithmic search, and even
common sense.
The ancient Greeks were the first to recognize value of heuristics in decision-making.
Aristotle acknowledges that humans reason, and he explores the various forms this reasoning can
take (Aristotle, 2007). Furthermore, he realizes that not all reasoning must follow formal logic,
admitting for example that the value of experience is important when making decisions. Indeed,
Aristotle was probably the first philosopher to use heuristics as semi-formalized logic. Aristotle
applies the method of loci or topos (literally place, or location) as a persuasion technique by
using it as a general argument source from which individual arguments may derive. Aristotle
discourages the use of topics that are based on faulty arguments.

Heuristics-Based Business Decision-Making
In this section, I discuss the use of heuristics in business decisions. The heuristics that

executives apply are frequently based on their personal experience when they make business
decisions. Some of these heuristics can be straightforward and simple for people who understand
the business jargon.
For example, when facing the prospect of a merger or a venture capital investment
opportunity, "Apply 5 times sales for business valuation" is a straightforward business heuristic,
even if it may be valid in some situations and not in others. Sometime the business heuristic or
rule of thumb can be more subtle. Certain rules of thumb do not contain clear information about
what or how to apply them; they presume that the person needing those rules of thumb possesses
the information required to make the decision.
In another example, the rule of thumb that states to, "apply a meaningful and prompt
response," is not clear, because the understanding of meaningful and prompt response can vary
with each person. One interpretation of meaningful and prompt response could be to, "call the
client right away, and confirm your call with an email or letter to ensure the issue was resolved."
Whereas, for another person, the same rule of thumb could mean to "call the client - within the
week," or to, "write a letter, as soon as you find some time for it."
Moreover, executives can seldom rely on peer support from inside their organization.
Indeed, it may be difficult for them to share with their managers or employees some of the issues
their businesses are facing. Executives cannot discuss various matters with their senior staff
because it could affect their staff positively or negatively; they cannot discuss those issues with
their colleagues from other companies for competitive reasons. Their board members can give
them moral support and some form of mentorship, although, not enough to address the daily

<-----Page 17----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

6

predicaments they are facing. It is lonely at the top. What are they to do? Repeatedly they end-up
using their own gut-feel and take their chances (Gigerenzer, 2007). Sometimes they are right,
sometimes not. These are hit and miss situations.

1.4

Statistical or Quantitative Heuristics and their Limitations
In this section, I argue that decision-making based solely on statistical or quantifiable

business heuristics can lead to faulty decisions because this form of decision often does not
consider the non-quantifiable elements intrinsic to the decision process.
Indeed, early application of heuristics in business generally took the form of statistical or
quantitative analysis (Hinkle & Kuehn, 1966). Certainly, when facing quantifiable financial
problems, executives have at their disposal a plethora of mathematical models, economic laws,
statistical formulas, algorithms (as specific computational procedures for numerical
manipulations), and various risk analysis tools to assist them with decision-making. However,
one cannot always quantify business risk (Coleman, 2006). What are executives supposed to do
when the outcomes are not quantifiable?
Numerous decision-making theories, like Bernoulli's Expected Utility Theory (Bernoulli,
1738, translated 1954), Rank Dependent Expected Theory (Quiggin, 1991), and Prospect Theory
(Kahneman, 1979), use risk analysis reasoning of the form:

in which wi is a decision weight and u(xi) is the utility of outcome xi.
In the above formula, E(U) represents a model of the Expected Utility Theory decisionmaking. This model considers that a decision is the acceptance of an uncertain proposition,

<-----Page 18----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

7

delivering probable benefits - hence expected utility. This probable benefit is equal to the sum of
each possible result represented by the utility u(xi) of the outcomes, multiplied by the respective
weights wi of the decision, in terms of expected gains versus losses. These weights can relate to
both the event and to its outcome, particularly when ambiguity is involved. The above generic
formula recognizes that people assign different weights to different events. For example, people
tend to overweight dramatic occurrences, and prefer gains to losses. These weights relate to the
event and its potential outcomes, particularly when the outcomes are ambiguous. However, in
business, one often cannot compute decision weights.
Because of these informational constraints, some concrete applications of those theories
have been useful in psychology, economics, and finance; however, they strike me as meaningless
for most daily business-decisions. Often the daily challenges executives face originate from
dilemmas that need immediate response, leaving little time for detailed analysis. Executives
frequently do not have the time, the expertise, or the experts available when needed. These
conditions establish a need for the use of heuristics-based decision-making.
I am not claiming here that quantitative analysis relying on quantifiable data is to be
disregarded. I argue that one should not use exclusively quantitative data when making business
decisions. What are then those heuristics that may provide solutions to the pressing daily
business problems executives face?
I will illustrate heuristics-based decision-making with some examples using qualitative
business heuristics.
As the chief financial officer of a maritime services company (a shipyard serving fishing
fleets), I had to make capital investment decisions, mostly associated with new equipment or

<-----Page 19----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

8

facilities improvement. The company was often short of capital, therefore any new investment
needed to meet stringent criteria, one of which was a payback period of three years or less.
One investment opportunity consisted in upgrading aging machine-shop equipment. The
machine shop supervisors found new lathes that met their needs and suggested that the company
purchase those machines. The capital required was around $500,000.
Most heuristics applied to capital investments decisions of this kind are based on
straightforward calculations, usually applying a cost/benefit analysis. I informed the supervisors
of the company's rule regarding capital investment and advised them to submit a business case,
with the help of the finance department, showing that this investment meets the required
cost/benefit criteria (Kotchen, 2010).
Taking into account various variables (like maintenance costs of the old equipment,
overtime, improved productivity) the business case developed by the machine shop supervisors
and the finance team showed that investing in the new equipment as compared to continuing
with the use of the old equipment had the same financial consequences. This meant that, if I
applied the standard cost/benefit rules, I could not justify this capital investment.
However, I had to consider other business heuristics, like, "Listen to your employees,"
"Insure employees' opinions are considered," and "Maintain high employee morale." These
heuristics were qualitative; they did not provide reliable quantifiable data. These qualitative
heuristics suggest the decision-maker needs to looks beyond the numbers, goes beyond formal
logic, and applies a different set of decision criteria based on unquantifiable information that
may apparently contradict the payback period rule. Believing that the acquisition of new
equipment was an important motivational element for the machine shop supervisors, I decided to

<-----Page 20----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

9

apply the 'unreliable' qualitative heuristics instead of the more 'reliable' quantitative one. The
company acquired the new equipment.
The results were surprising to me. The payback period was half of the originally
predicted one. Indeed, the machinists were so enthusiastic in using the new equipment that their
performance level was much higher than the one they predicted, resulting in increased
productivity, work output, and revenue growth.
Beyond the immediate cost/benefits resulting from the decision to acquire the new
equipment, the machinists could now work on new products that were inaccessible to them
before. One example was the production of a Shaft Brush Assembly that could be used as an
alternative conduit for electricity in ships, reducing the electrolysis damage on the shaft (an
expensive piece of equipment) and complementing the role the sacrificial anodes (zinc)
protecting the ship's metal frame. [Explanatory note: different metals in a conductive liquid, like
seawater, create a type of battery. The resulting current removes metal from one of the metal
pieces (electrolysis). The piece to protect is the propeller and the shaft it is attached to.]
When including the additional product line, the productivity, the reduced maintenance
costs, the new equipment expenditure was recovered within a year of purchase.
On another occasion, I had to face an irate customer with a legitimate complaint about a
deficient product - a non-performing polyurethane hydraulic seal. The production demand was
high (tens of thousands of pneumatic seals per month), and the consequences of failure were
important because if the pneumatic equipment using this kind of seals was leaking, the
equipment was unusable. I hesitated between two responses to a situation of this kind: a
defensive response (talk to my lawyer) or a pro-active response (support the customer).

<-----Page 21----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

10

Applying the "customer is always right" heuristic could have been considered risky,
because if this were the case, my company risked a losing litigation. At first, I did not yet receive
the information confirming or contradicting the customer's claim. I still preferred to give my
customer the benefit of the doubt. By avoiding a confrontation (talking to a lawyer) and opening
the door to a discussion (accepting that the customer was right, and the product defective, which
proved to be the case later), I diffused a potentially dangerous situation to our mutual advantage.
The customer had the opportunity to explain the problem, and brainstorm various solutions
(costly for the company but beneficial to the customer), resulting with an acceptable solution: a
recall and a correction in manufacturing process. My company's credibility was reinforced, the
customer secured, and the manufacturing process improved. No amount of quantitative
information would have given similar results.
Sometimes the available information can be fuzzy. As the president of a hi-tech
manufacturing company, I had to consider a number of merger or acquisition opportunities.
These were often potential avenues for growth. I found these opportunities quite challenging. On
one hand, their appeal was real because they implied important infusion of capital, something the
company was always in need of; on the other hand, those offers implied loss of control, or
cultural change, with the transformation that would most certainly follow.
My board would generally support my recommendations when an opportunity of this
kind arose. However, on one occasion, my partner and I disagreed on an acquisition opportunity.
My partner was 10 years older than I was; he was more eager to sell the company and retire than
I was. I was convinced that the interested party was not trustworthy based on my experience with
previous medium manufacturing companies with, at their helm, an owner more interested in
short-term rather than long-term return on investment. The heuristic I applied was, "When in

<-----Page 22----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

11

doubt, refuse the deal."
I confess that my partner followed the standard due diligence process to reduce my
doubts and convince me of the value of the acquisition for both the senior management and the
shareholders alike. I remained unconvinced and argued accordingly at the board table. I was
overruled and agreed to leave the company with a suitable arrangement. Nine months later, the
company went bankrupt. I learned that the suitor arranged for a large order that did not
materialize. The company was undercapitalized to meet the demand and the bank foreclosed.
The suitor bought the company in a fire sale at 20 cents on the dollar. I was right to refuse the
deal. Some board members acknowledged this to me later.
The following is another example in which the quantitative approach in decision-making
led to a faulty decision.
When Richard Feynman was investigating the shuttle's reliability following the Columbia
disaster in 1986, he noticed that the probability of a failure was estimated by management to be 1
in 100,000 but 1 in 100 by the engineers (Feynman, 2001). Instead of accepting the discrepancy
of those estimates as a sign of weakness, management preferred to rely on numbers; numbers
that, in hindsight, made no sense. The estimate by management was wrong giving a false sense
of security, and, therefore, supporting the decision to launch the shuttle.
In extreme conditions, when executives face major effects of faulty decision-making
based on incomplete information, the application of formal logic and of statistical probabilities
can lead to disastrous consequences.

1.5

Qualitative Heuristics as a Valid Decision-Making Alternative
Applying exclusively quantitative heuristics in decision-making can lead to faulty

<-----Page 23----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

12

decisions; therefore, the use of qualitative heuristics can be a valid alternative for heuristicsbased decision-making. When not enough information is available to make a business decision,
and when the executive needs to make a decision anyway, using qualitative heuristics can
become an expedient tool for the decision-making process. Indeed, the executive deals with
incomplete information and needs to fill in the void with a process that may lead to a workable
outcome. Under these circumstances, qualitative heuristics can assist in making fast and frugal
business decisions (Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Goldstein, 2008).
In most business schools, teaching formal decision-making processes is currently the
norm. For example, some business management schools describe decision analysis courses as
"decision-oriented courses that focus on the frameworks, concepts, theories, and principles
needed to organize and use information to make informed business decisions." A closer analysis
of the courses' content reveals that those courses mostly cover operations management and
statistics. The formal decision-making process relies on quantitative data, hence limiting the
decision-making process to the application of quantitative heuristics. I am not advocating that
these kinds of courses are not useful in business management. Managers need to apply various
quantitative tools when they face quantifiable problems - like financial opportunities that need
scrutiny, or operation gridlocks that need resolution. However, most of these situations are
usually delegated to professionals, like statisticians, accountants, operational, or financial
managers that have the time and required detailed analytical knowledge to study those kinds of
problems and suggest appropriate solutions. Executives will then review the suggestions, consult
with their managers, and ensure proper decisions are applied. These situations often do not
require on the spot resolutions.
Charles Hinkle, emeritus faculty at the College of Business, University of Colorado,

<-----Page 24----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

13

argues that:
Value creation in the 20th century was largely defined by the conversion of
heuristics to algorithms. It was about taking a fundamental understanding of a
‗mystery‘–a heuristic–and driving it to a formula, an algorithm–so that it could be
driven to huge scale and scope. (Hinkle & Kuehn, 1966)
Dr. Roger Martin, Dean of Rotman School of Management (University of Toronto),
proposes the following definition for heuristics:"Heuristics are rules of thumb or sets of
guidelines for solving a mystery by organized exploration of the possibilities" (Martin, 2004). He
continues,
Heuristics do not guarantee success–they simply increase the probability of getting to a
successful outcome. They represent an incomplete understanding of a heretofore mystery.
Business people will have to become more like designers — more ‗masters of heuristics‘
than ‗managers of algorithms‘. (Martin, 2004)
The above two references illustrate opposing views concerning the wide range of
heuristics interpretations in academia.
Even if the scientific research method takes for granted that one can arrive at valid
conclusions based on formal logic and exhaustive testing, in daily business decision-making,
informal logic and use of qualitative heuristics can also lead to satisfactory results (Gigerenzer et
al., 2008) and (Kahneman, 1979). Understanding the importance of qualitative heuristics
becomes essential in decision-making because the business executive will need, at some point, to
face his stakeholders (employees, customers, vendors, and shareholders) and explain or justify
the decisions made.

<-----Page 25----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

14

Researchers like Herbert Simon and Gerd Gigerenzer have studied the importance of
qualitative data as opposed to the use of quantitative data in decision-making. Simon introduced
the term Bounded Rationality with useful application in economics. Simon states "boundedly
rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing
(receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) information" (Williamson, 1981). This theory
maintains that models of human-decision-making should rely on what individual humans know
and not on assumptions like the laws of probability. Simon stressed that "Because of the limits
on their [computers and the human brain included] computing speeds and power, intelligent
systems must use approximate methods to handle most tasks. Their rationality is bounded."
(Simon, 1990). These computing methods include recognizing elements of the circumstances
similar to those previously experienced, therefore reducing the need for additional information
search. Simon further advocates the use of heuristics for information search and for needing to
stop search. Simon also suggests using simple rules for deciding how to use found information,
like the rule of syllogism in formal logic (Simon, 1990).
On the other hand, research by Gigerenzer and his team at the Max Plank Institute for
Human Development shows that applying heuristics for problem-solving can lead to remarkably
accurate solutions (Gigerenzer et al., 2008).
In addition, new research in judgment and decision-making (JDM) shows that
unquantifiable elements like emotion and feelings also have an important influence in decisionmaking (Slovic, Garling, Vastfjall, & Peters, 2006). Emotions and feelings are also often at the
source of qualitative heuristics.
Applying qualitative heuristics for business decisions comes with its caveat resulting
from unsubstantiated assumptions, groupthink, prejudice, or personal bias. On the other hand, as

<-----Page 26----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

15

one increases the use of business heuristics in making business decisions, one also increases
one's experience, knowledge base, and comfort level of using fast and frugal heuristics.
Ultimately, knowing what heuristic to apply does not imply that a decision will take place. The
executive has the final say whether to apply the business heuristic or reject it.

1.6

Summary
In summary, business heuristics involve formal or informal application of rules,

processes, and methods for problem-solving, a level of incompleteness or uncertainty, and
eventually, the discovery of a solution that is not necessarily 100% reliable, but is a solution that
can nevertheless result in positive business outcomes. Heuristics-based decision-making does not
need to follow formal logic. Heuristics can derive from the familiarity of the settings one
operates in, without any a priori, formal logical foundation.
I asked myself if Canadian business executives use regularly business heuristics when
making business decisions. I was wondering what sort of heuristics executives use, and if used,
how could one apply those business heuristics to improve the business decision-making process.
These questions formed the basis of my research.
The present state of research in small and medium Canadian businesses (and by extension
- most small and medium business) about heuristics-based decision-making is limited.
Systematic scientific research on that topic remains scarce (Haldin-Herrgard, 2000) and
(Hancyk, 2003). I present a detailed literature review in Chapter 3, Heuristics Scholarship.

1.7

Research Methodology and Summary Results
I present in this section an overview of my research methodology and a summary of the

research results. I describe the research methodology in Chapter 5: Research Methodology, and

<-----Page 27----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

16

Study Design.
Relying on my business experience, I decided to use 10 business scenarios I encountered
in various situations, as examples in which business heuristics would have assisted me in making
a business decision. Each scenario describes a situation that required a swift, usually immediate
decision. These scenarios were used in a survey in which participants were asked to suggest
various heuristics-based solutions to the challenges the executive was facing. Analysis of the
survey results convincingly reflects the use of heuristics-based decision-making in small and
medium Canadian businesses.

Because my research focus was heuristics-based decision-making, my interest was
primarily in discovering whether business executives use explicit or tacit heuristics when making
business decisions. My research questions are the following:

1. Are small and medium Canadian business executives using heuristics when making
business decisions?
2. Assuming a positive answer to the first question, what are the heuristics small and
medium Canadian business executives use when making business decisions?
3. When small and medium Canadian business executives use heuristics when making
business decisions, do they use explicit business heuristics, tacit business heuristics,
or both?
4. How can one improve the decision-making process by using tacit business heuristics?
Preliminary pilot studies at the University of Victoria‘s Human Computer Interface Lab,
substantiate that business executives often make decisions based on personal experience using
various heuristics. As an alternative to formally established rules, such personal experience may

<-----Page 28----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

17

also represent business knowledge acquired during their career. Building on these results, I
developed a modest thesis research study composed of four phases.
In the first phase, I describe 10 scenarios based on my own business experience, requiring
business decision-making or business problem-solving using heuristics. During the second phase,
I solicit a non-probabilistic group of Vancouver Island executives to suggest heuristics for each
scenario they feel comfortable addressing. I analyze the result of the survey responses and
categorize the identified business heuristics in the third phase. I present my findings in the fourth
phase.
Three distinct groups participated in the study. The first group was composed of secondyear University of Victoria MBA students. Members of this group represented future executives
with, presently, limited business experience; they served as a baseline group.
The second group consisted of business mentors volunteering at the University of
Victoria‘s School of Business. Members of this group included seasoned business executives
who were at the peak of their career, or who retired.
The third group represented executives, whose businesses were registered with either the
Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce or the Vancouver Island Advanced Technology Centre.
These executives managed small or medium hi-tech firms, or various small or medium business
firms on Vancouver Island.
Research results provide evidence that small and medium Canadian business executives
routinely use heuristics when making business decisions. Data obtained from the online surveys
includes 2,465 statements out of which 2,419 (98.1%) were either explicit or tacit heuristics;
only 46 (1.9%) contained various comments not considered heuristics. Indeed, all the businesses

<-----Page 29----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

18

executives participating in the research applied various forms of heuristics when suggesting
solutions to business problems, providing evidence that the use heuristics in decision-making is
prevalent in that population.
My extensive business experience also supports these findings. Furthermore, a review of
heuristics scholarship in Chapter 3, indirectly corroborates those results for big business.
Once the various heuristics were consolidated by eliminating repetitions, I developed and
applied a set of criteria to distinguish explicit versus tacit heuristics. Using these criteria, I
extrapolated 432 explicit or tacit heuristics from the available residual data. A subdivision of the
explicit heuristics category consists of N=278 (or 64%), with a parallel subdivision of the tacit
heuristics category of N=157 (or 36%). Further statistical analysis establishes the ratio between
explicit and tacit heuristics to about 60% to 40%. This strongly supports the statement that tacit
and explicit heuristics are both commonly used when making business decisions.
I propose a set of what-how rules that facilitate the conversion of tacit business heuristics
into explicit ones.

1.8

Future Research
If a better heuristics-based decision-making process is a competitive asset for small and

medium business, as several recent studies claim, (Levin & Cross, 2004), (Butler, Le Grice, &
Reed, 2006), and (Strassmann, 2006), then a method for organizing various forms of this asset
can deliver significant benefits to those businesses .
A useful follow-up study could address the use of heuristics as a knowledge-transfer
mechanism in small and medium Canadian businesses. Indeed, similar to the apprenticeship
process used in various trades, a better understanding of heuristics as a business apprenticeship

<-----Page 30----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

19

tool would be an interesting topic to pursue. An ancillary study to the above could consist in
determining the types of errors in judgment some small and medium business executives make.
Helping to avoid such errors would further improve the heuristics-based decision-making
process.

Chapter 2: Background and Self-Anthropology
In this chapter, I describe my background, because this narrative portrays relevant
information to the discussions regarding the source for the research scenarios and the
interpretation of the research results.

2.1

The Researcher’s Experience: a Self-anthropology
The business knowledge of an executive is that person‘s expertise and skill acquired

through experience or education. By definition, an autobiography is a biography in a form of life
story of oneself written by oneself. In the context of this dissertation, I believe that my 30-year
experience as a senior executive in several small and medium Canadian businesses (SMCB)
represents a valuable example of what I have learned, and shared with others.
Usually an autobiography follows a chronological sequence, describing a series of events
over time. For the purpose of this research, my autobiography covers specific nodal moments
that occurred during my various business experiences. Each period is not necessary linked to the
following one in a logical way other than by time: I present events in chronological order,
without any regard to why they occurred in such a way.

2.2

The Early Years
I was born in Zagreb, Croatia (former Yugoslavia), on the last day of the year WWII

ended. Two years later, my parents, (and I) moved to Israel. In Israel, I attended international
private schools (K-12) where I learned French, English, and Hebrew. At home, we spoke SerboCroatian and German. From an early age, I became fluent in those languages. Following the
advice of my high-school philosophy teacher, I enrolled in the University of Jerusalem to study

<-----Page 32----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

21

Mathematics, Philosophy, and Theology. Those topics introduced me to various ways of
applying heuristics in problem-solving. My Dominican and Jesuits teachers installed in me a
sense of curiosity and analysis, which contributed to expand my views during my philosophy,
mathematics, and logic studies. Wanting to understand better my roots, I decided to continue my
undergraduate studies in Yugoslavia.
The private schooling experience taught me to be self-sufficient; hence moving to a
different country was not a deterrent, but rather an adventure. During the early 70s, Belgrade was
already an open and burgeoning European city. Yugoslavia was a good base for travelling across
Europe, and the economy was solid, with a large number of migrant workers contributing to the
country‘s economy. I enrolled in the Faculty of Mathematics, at the University of Belgrade. I
remember well some of my teachers at the time, notably Professor Djuro Kurepa. He inspired my
passion for the study of logic, a passion still present. I graduated with honours.

2.3

The Formative Years
The first two years following immediately my undergraduate studies were those that

instilled my interest in teaching. During this period, I was a mathematics teacher at a technical
high school in Belgrade while continuing some post-graduate research in mathematical logic
with professor Kurepa.
Not only did I enjoy teaching a subject that was difficult for my high school students, but
I also inspired them into applying to the classroom, some of their acquired technical knowledge
in electronics. They built, using the school‘s workshop, an interactive "clicker." Every student
desk was equipped with a multi-choice switch (5 choices), which was connected to a central
console on the teacher‘s table. This teaching method increased students‘ interaction between

<-----Page 33----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

22

themselves, and their engagement to the subject matter, because learning took the form of a
game.
During this formative period, I had to face the challenges of one form of knowledge
transfer: teaching in the classroom. I also learned that modeling knowledge was possible by
converting rote learning into a game, and increasing in this way the interest of the learners in the
process. Later on, in my professional career, I used often this teaching model to convey to my
clients or employees, the importance of visualizing a problem to find solutions.

2.4

The Growing Years
Believing that my opportunities were limited in Yugoslavia, I moved to Canada in the

early 70s. Shortly after my arrival to Montreal, I started working as a credit manager for an
import/export firm. The few months spent with that firm made me realize the challenges one
faces in business. I had to manage hundreds of business credit accounts, some of which were
delinquent. Conveying the proper message to the delinquent customer was important: indeed, the
objective was to be paid without losing the customer‘s good will, and continuing the business
relationship. This was my first foray into the finance industry, not knowing that I will soon work
in this sector for the next 20 years.
A few months year later, I joined IBM, where I learned not only about computer
technology (mainframes) but also about the North American business environment. Those first
five years with IBM were influential and prepared me well for what was to follow.
I was fortunate to experience three major learning phases with IBM: the technical phase,
consisting in learning about the technology, the systems engineering phase, consisting in
applying what I learned to IBM business clients, and the marketing and managerial phase,

<-----Page 34----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

23

involving project management, and mainframe computers marketing and sales.
During the IBM technical phase, I was introduced to the technological challenges
mainframes faced in the mid-70s, and the importance of human-machine-interaction, a major
challenge at that time. In the 70s,‗techies‘ were facing the challenge of explaining complex
technology features and benefits to businesspersons who had little or no knowledge of computer
technology; the solution, converting technology‘s technical features into business benefits using
analogies. For example, implementing a computer-managed inventory using IVRS (Interactive
Voice Response System) for MEDIS (a major Quebec-based pharmaceutical distributor), would
not only keep track of inventory with fewer errors, but would also improve the re-ordering
process, reduce unused inventory items, therefore, freeing working capital that could be directed
toward increasing sales or market penetration. One needed to convert technology into a business
case, giving technology a quantitative interpretation that business managers could understand.
The IBM systems engineering phase involved planning the conversion of a major
financial institution‘s outdated terminal network to an up-to-date, online banking system. As a
member of a team of technical experts, I developed a comprehensive conversion process that
involved a number of conversion teams, going from branch to branch, and converting the old
branch system to the new one. After the first few unsuccessful conversions, it became obvious
that something important was missing. Our limited knowledge of the branch banking operations
was affecting our project planning and implementation process. To remediate to this lack of
knowledge and experience, the IBM project team ended-up building in the lab, a full-scale
simulation of a bank branch. This lab bank branch was staffed with real bank branch personnel
(tellers, accountants, and management), real terminals, real bank counters, and fake customers.
Using this technique, we were able to identify the major deficiencies of our conversion process,

<-----Page 35----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

24

modify our implementation strategy, and fan out a solid conversion method that worked out in
the field. The mentoring of our team by the branch manager was valuable in the process.
I was ready to assume more responsibilities, and start to develop my experience in
marketing and management.
During the IBM marketing and management phase, my responsibilities included
converting a Burroughs banking customer, to IBM. This took a couple of years with a successful
outcome for IBM. This was also my most formative IBM period, as it involved inter-personal
relations instead of technical or financial challenges.
The saying was, at that time that IBM was a good school for future executives. Indeed, I
had the opportunity to learn how to acquire knowledge on a subject completely foreign to me
(computers were a rarity at the time), and apply that knowledge in challenging business
environments – the financial industry.

2.5

The Professional Years
From IBM, I moved to the Movement Desjardins (Desjardins), a major financial

cooperative group in the province of Quebec. As a senior executive with Desjardins, I had
firsthand experience of a wide variety of financial challenges small and medium businesses face.
The Desjardins period could also be divide intro three distinct phases: the professional
years, the management years, and the international years.
During the first couple of years at Desjardins, I faced a steep learning curve, entering the
corporate world, and its political challenges. As a senior professional, my projects included
planning and implementing a network of automated teller machines, and finalizing the
implementation of the banking network started while with IBM. Considering that Desjardins was

<-----Page 36----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

25

a financial cooperative composed of 12 independent federations and more than 1,500 branches
across the province of Quebec, one needed to perfect the team approach, and adapt to a decision
by consensus process, typical in a cooperative environment. Accepting a different decisionmaking paradigm was my first priority – a decision made by a group instead of an individual.
During this first phase, my most valuable lesson was that of patience. I was fortunate in finding a
mentor in the Desjardins Movement‘s general manager, who was well conversant with the
hurdles I was about to face. The acquisition of a cooperative mentality was valuable later on,
when I took the responsibility of implementing a global financial lending strategy plan in Latin
America.
The management years at Desjardins included the integration of Desjardins to the
Canadian banking system through the Canadian Payment Association (CPA). This involved
negotiations at the corporate, provincial, and federal levels, ending up with the integration of
Desjardins as a member of the CPA. As a CPA member, Desjardins would no longer need to
keep a deposit in another bank to insure inter-financial institutional payment transfers. This also
meant important savings for Desjardins, because the need for a multimillion-dollar daily float
(money not earning interest) in another bank was eliminated.
The major lessons learned from this experience consisted in understanding better the
political motivations involved in finding win-win solutions in a highly competitive marketplace.
The institutions sitting on the CPA committee were competitors and had to work together to
make the flow of money work efficiently.
While with Desjardins, an opportunity arose to head an international project in Latin
America, sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) involving the
COLAC cooperative movement (Confederacion Latinoamericana de Coopertivas de Ahorro y

<-----Page 37----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

26

Credito), the Lain American Confederation of Savings and Loans Cooperatives.
I went through a culture shock: that of the Latin American way of life, compared to the
North American one. Indeed, the legal, and national financial infrastructures we are used to
count on in Canada, (like the Canada Bank Act, the Bank of Canada, the Canadian Payment
Association, the Canadian Banking Association, for example) were absent in Latin American
countries. Covering 19 countries out of Panama City (Panama), visiting local federations in some
countries, meeting with various levels of government, and understanding the expectations from
the international cooperative movement, were some of the challenges that needed to be faced.
Here the gift of patience acquired in Quebec came in handy, because the Latin American culture
(as opposed to our North American one) has a different sense of urgency – time becomes an ally
instead of a constraint.

2.6

The Management-Consulting Years
On my return from Panama City to Montreal, I was ready to enter the world of

consulting. I wanted to share the experience gained in those first 10 years in business with
companies needing assistance as they grew or struggled to survive.
My first foray into management consulting was with Peat Marwick (today KPMG),
among the largest professional services firms in the world at the time. As a senior consultant, I
was called often to assist companies facing some sort of financial distress. The projects involved
companies across Canada, the USA, and Haiti. In most instances, I had to inform the company‘s
top management of the seriousness of the difficulty there were in, the corrective measures that
they needed to take, and to suggest various implementation plans that would assist them in
regaining their financial stability. Only one of my KPMG clients did not follow the proposed

<-----Page 38----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

27

recommendations. That client ended-up bankrupt a few months later.
Soon after joining KPMG, an IBM colleague and friend, who joined a young Quebecbased information technology consulting company (Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique CGI), gave me a call and suggested I join CGI, which I did a few months later. As a partner and
director of consulting services with CGI, presently one of the biggest management-consulting
firms in the world, I had the opportunity to work with a large number of small, medium, and big
businesses, in the private and public sectors. My clients came from a variety of market segments
(finance, distribution, and manufacturing). However, my specialty remained mainly in finance,
serving banks, trusts, stock exchanges, and insurance companies.
Working with top executives in those companies taught me the importance of applying
strong listening skills, expressing clearly my findings (mostly in form of business
recommendations), and attention to detail. The detail consisted in ensuring that the conveyed
message was not only understood, but was also understood the way it was supposed to be,
instead of becoming a modified interpretation by the listener.
A few vignettes hereafter, illustrate the activities during the CGI period. Because of
customer confidentiality, customer names and assignment specifics are not disclosed.
The challenge a stock exchange client was facing, consisted in ensuring 24/7 process
availability, and minimizing the inevitable maintenance and breakdown time. I provided, as a
model, the operations of the Visa department of a local bank. Visiting those operations during
off-peak and peak hours, understanding the logistics required to ensure 24/7 service availability,
was a revelation to the stock exchange client. This resulted in an acquisition of additional
computing equipment, and a business process re-engineering contract of the existing information

<-----Page 39----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

28

technology procedures.
A problem faced by an insurance company consisted in checking that the life insurance
forms, completed by the field agents, were free of errors, before submitting them for approval to
the head office. Establishing a validation online link between the company agents‘ mobile units
(laptops in this case), and head office, was the solution – borrowed from the travel agency
industry, which had similar requirements. This was achieved long before the Internet era, using
dial-up communication technology and private networks.
In several instances, once the strategic plan was accepted by senior management, I
remained as a support resource to senior and middle level management, assisting them in
converting the strategic plan (what needs to be done) into a tactical one (how to do it), and
finally into an operational one (doing it).
During the early 90s, I headed a CGI branch operation in Victoria, British Columbia,
where I faced the challenges of dealing with the provincial government and its complex decisionmaking infrastructure. This was an opportunity to be acquainted with the politically motivated
New Democratic Party's (NDP) decision-making process.
One of the most satisfying projects of this period consisted in developing a technology
and telecommunications strategy plan for the three Canadian military colleges: The Royal
Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, the Royal Roads Military College
(RRMC), in Victoria, British Columbia, and Collège Militaire Royal de Saint-Jean (CMR), in St.
Jean d‘Iberville, Quebec. RRMC and CM were closed a few years later because of government
cutbacks on defense spending. However, the technology infrastructure survived in the conversion
of RRMC into the Royal Roads University.

<-----Page 40----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

29

The Entrepreneurship Years
Instead of moving back East, I decided to leave CGI in the early 90s. This allowed me to

form my own consulting firm, and apply the acquired experience to my own business.
This section describes the period, during which I held the positions of managing director
of Stellar Systems Group (SSG),- a consulting firm, president of VIC TEC Corporation (VTC) a high-tech manufacturing company, chief financial officer of Point Hope Shipyard (PHS) - a
ship construction and services company, and director of operations at University Canada West
(UCW), a private university.
The above companies had their headquarters in Victoria, with branches across British
Colombia, or other parts of the world. Some of those companies have inspired the business
scenarios used in the research part of this study.
Stellar Systems Group (SSG)
Feeling too young to retire after leaving CGI, I was looking for some business challenges.
I was approached by the president of Stellar Systems Group (SSG) to head a floundering division
specialized in technology training. The requirement consisted in making the division profitable,
increasing its customer base, and diversifying its product line. This took a couple of years.
Diversifying the customer base meant reversing the revenue stream from mainly
government customers to a balanced mix of public and private sector customers, expanding the
product base by developing some vertical training programs, (like Microsoft Certification), and
an increase of the services rendered by opening branches in Vancouver, Prince George,
Kelowna, and Nelson. SSG was sold to EDS, an American consulting company.

<-----Page 41----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

30

Scenario 4, (Move Decision), and Scenario 10, (Joint Venture), relate specifically to the
events I have encountered when leading SSG.
VIC TEC Corporation (VTC)
VTC was a new business venture capitalizing on the discovery of a revolutionary
material with remarkable qualities. The product‘s trademark was COOLPAC™. This material
was composed of a unique blend of polyurethane and proprietary chemicals. Specialized
manufacturing methods gave it characteristics not found in any other product of its kind. The
main application was in hydraulics; however, other applications were developed over time.
I could not resist the challenges this company offered, and accepted to become the
president of VTC. My objectives were to raise venture capital, diversify the product line, expand
the customer base, and improve the profitability of the failing start-up. I achieved the above
objectives over three years.
The main research and development projects at VTC included the improved automation
of the manufacturing process, the expansion of the product line from hydraulics to pneumatics,
the negotiation of agency agreement in Europe (England, France, and Italy) and the planning of a
new plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
I left the company when it was about to be acquired by a US competitor, against my
advice. Shortly after my departure the company was indeed acquired by a US firm (Grover
Corporation, out of Milwaukee, WI), which dismantled the Saanich plant and moved it to the
US, closing the Canadian operations.
Study scenarios 1 (Company Valuation), 2 (Cost Forecasts), 3 (Lawsuit), 7 (Project
Slippage), and 8 (Quality Management) were based on various business predicaments

<-----Page 42----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

31

encountered while with VTC.
Point Hope Shipyard (PHS)
After acquiring the company to avoid bankruptcy, the new management at PHS was in
dire need of fresh operating capital to meet the growing demand in marine services. The
company was ripe for injection of fresh capital, a reorganization of its operating practices, and
new negotiations with its unionized workforce. The president invited me to assist him in
achieving those objectives. After reviewing the company‘s financial status, I accepted the
position of CFO with extended operational responsibilities.
My tenure with PHS was eventful, because not only was the union involved in PHS's
daily operations and had some input on how business was managed, but also because of the
growing pains and large demands in resources (financial, technical, and human) PHS needed to
meet its growth target. I succeeded in stabilizing the company financially, ensuring a regular
flow of work, and securing operating capital and cash flow based on its receivables.
Some of the eventful realizations at PHS included debt renegotiations with lending
institutions, various levels of government, and the vendor community. A "pay-as-you-go"
customer payment policy insured steadier cash flow, and assisted in better cash management. I
left the company a few years later, following the delivery of a new pilot boat to Pacific Pilotage
Authority Canada.
Study scenarios 1 (company Valuation), 5 (Credit Line), 6 (Collective Agreement), and 7
(Project Slippage) reflect quandaries encountered at PHS.

University Canada West (UCW)
The launching of a new private university in Victoria revived my interest in teaching. I
joined as faculty of UCW shortly after its creation, and enjoyed developing, and delivering
graduate and undergraduate courses to a growing student base. UCW‘s president invited me to
take on the responsibilities of operations while continuing to act as active faculty. I accepted, and
spent a few years with this institution as Director of Operations, until the Vancouver-based
Eminata group acquired it.

2.8

The Academic Adventure
Over the years, I continued to be highly interested in teaching. While with IBM, an

opportunity arose to teach computer science at University of Montreal‘s school of business
(Hautes Études Commerciales – H.E.C.). Soon after, the University of Sherbrooke, with a
growing student base in the Information Technology department of the Faculty of Science,
invited me to teach in Sherbrooke. This gave me the chance to develop and deliver a number of
computer science and business courses. Since then, I have also developed and delivered a wide
range of computer science and business courses at the University of Victoria, Royal Roads
University, Camosun College, University of Phoenix, University Canada West, and Meritus
University.
Following 30 years of various business experiences, challenges and trepidations, I finally
decided to set aside time for myself, and focus on my on-going objective of lifelong learning.
Presently, while continuing to be active as a teacher, I can dedicate my time to research
and course development activities. I devoted the last few years to teaching, studying, and
working on my PhD thesis.

Chapter 3: Heuristics Scholarship
In this chapter, I present an overview of heuristics scholarship. I explore the diverse
definitions of heuristics used in a variety of human endeavours. I examine various definitions of
the terms heuristic and heuristics in literature, online and print dictionaries. I define heuristic
categories. I suggest a business heuristics definition. Finally, I present a summary overview of
heuristics application in politics, psychology, philosophy, law, economics, computer science,
education, the military, medicine, and business.

3.1

Background
When reviewing various definitions of the word ‗heuristic‘ I discern a common

denominator that of discovery. Indeed heuristics have been used traditionally, rightly or wrongly,
as a method to discover solutions to a variety of problems.
I present hereafter a brief overview of heuristics etymology.
Greek: ευρισκειν, heuriskein - to discover, to find; see also ευρετήζ, heuretes – the one
who discovers; and ευρίσκω, heurísko, I find.
German: heuristisch - bezeichnet die Kunst, mit begrenztem Wissen und wenig Zeit zu
guten Lösungen zu kommen; (the art to find good solutions with limited knowledge and little
time – translated by me)
French: heuristique, euristique - l'art d'inventer, de faire des découvertes (Littré); (the art
of inventing, of discovering – translated by me)
English: heuristics - proceeding by trial and error (Oxford)
Heuristics are used in the common language because they tend to follow a syllogistic

<-----Page 45----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

34

argumentation process. This mode of argument, first described by Aristotle, became the
foundation of the Western logical thinking paradigm.
Considering that heuristics can either be unreliable, informal or both, and lead to valid or
invalid conclusions, one needs to be careful how one uses heuristics when making decisions.
Although heuristics may be useful, especially in circumstances that can lead to a rapid solution,
which may be reasonably close to the best answer, applying a heuristic-based solving process
does not guarantee the validity of that solution.
I trace the use of heuristic-based reasoning to the classic Greek rhetoricians. Aristotle
uses the words like invention to characterize the rhetorical process. The process of invention (in
the context of discovery) invites the rhetor (speaker) to explore alternative ideas that may lead to
an understanding of the subject matter or to a conclusive argument on a topic discussed. The
process is similar to that followed when one applies heuristics in problem-solving. Invention is
complemented with arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.
Aristotle introduces Rhetoric as an art of using language for persuasion. Rhetoric follows
three methods of logos (reason or rational discourse), pathos (experience or story telling), and
ethos (moral competence), as well as the five canons of memory, invention, delivery, style, and
arrangement. Along with grammar and logic or dialectic, rhetoric is one of the three ancient arts
of discourse. Aristotle identifies two broad types of topics (topoi), or lines of reasoning, as
effective persuasion categories. They consist of 28 common topics applicable in any types of
discourse, and special topics applicable in specific types of discourse, like political, judicial, or
ceremonial. (Braet, 2005)
Aristotle follows-up by analyzing the structures of rhetorical reasoning using the

<-----Page 46----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

35

enthymeme (from ‗enthumeisthai - to consider‘) and the example. Quoting Aristotle, "The
enthymeme is a sort of syllogism (sullogismos - i.e. a deductive argument), and the consideration
of syllogisms of all kinds, without distinction, is the business of dialectic, either of dialectic as a
whole, or of one of its branches." (Aristotle, 2007)
In other words, an enthymeme is a three-part deductive argument (syllogism) containing
an unstated assumption that must be true for the premises to lead to a valid conclusion. On the
other hand, the example takes usually the form of a long story, or that of a complex case, leading
to a probable but not certain conclusion.
This process is similar to the one used when applying heuristics to solve a problem: one
starts by stating the problem, followed by suggesting a heuristic that may lead to a solution,
based on a form of reasoning. Some of Aristotle‘s syllogisms can be considered as intuitive.
For example, Aristotle‘s Barbara syllogism states:
Every X is a Y.
Every Y is a Z.
Therefore, every X is a Z.
In "Rhetoric, Romance and Technology," Father Walter Ong argues that to find
something to say, one needs to analyze various models, reminiscent of classical antiquity‘s
dialectic: develop a structure to explain the choice of a particular result (Ong, 1971). Heuristics,
in this context, provide supporting arguments to the decision-maker, hence justifying that
decision.

Heuristics use in Human Endeavours
Wide varieties of human endeavours use heuristics for problem-solving. The most

common include business, military, games (including sports), medicine, computer science,
economics, statistics, the arts, academic research, engineering, history, rhetoric, law, agriculture,
religion, politics, science, fashion, education, psychology, and philosophy.
I describe hereafter some prevalent categories of human endeavors applying a heuristicsbased decision-making process. These are summarized in figure 1.

Figure 1. Human endeavors using heuristics
In politics, for example, the poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between cognitive
and rational theories of decision-making. PH uses a two-stage decision process. The first stage
consists in reducing the set of possible options by applying a ‗non-compensatory principle.‘ This
eliminates any alternative with an unacceptable return. During the second stage, the decision
maker uses analytic processing in an attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits (Mintz,
2004).

<-----Page 48----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

37

In psychology, heuristics are simple, efficient rules, proposed as an explanation of how
humans make decisions, come to judgments, and solve problems when facing complex problems
or incomplete information. These rules work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases
may lead to systematic cognitive biases (Sriram & Greenwald, 2009).
In philosophy, a heuristic (or a heuristic device) is used when an entity exists to enable
understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity. For example, a model, never
identical with what it models, is a heuristic device that can facilitate some understanding of what
it models. Stories and metaphors also can be termed heuristic devices in that sense. In his 1945
book How to solve it, Polya suggested a series of heuristics, like "If you are having difficulty
understanding a problem, try drawing a picture,", or "Try assuming that you have a solution and
seeing what you can derive from that," a form of "working backward." (Pólya, 1957)
In economics, heuristics are used when case-by-case analysis would be impractical, in
which practicality is defined by the interests of a governing body (Gigerenzer et al., 2008).
In law, Rissland and Skalak suggest 12 categories of heuristics used to reason legal cases;
they include for example, various ways to begin reasoning, rule-based near miss or near hit, or
sanity checks (Rissland, Skalak, & Friedman, 1994).
In computer science, a heuristic (or a heuristic algorithm) is a technique designed to
solve a problem that is not required to be 100% correct. However, the use of this technique
produces usually a good solution, or solves a simpler problem that contains, or intersects with the
solution of complex problem. Heuristics may assist in gaining computational performance, or
produce conceptual simplicity, at the potential cost of accuracy or precision (Pearl, 2001).
In human-computer interaction (HCI), heuristic evaluation is a usability-testing

<-----Page 49----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

38

technique devised by expert usability consultants. In heuristic evaluation, some experts review
the user interface and its compliance to a number of broadly stated characteristics of a good user
interface as defined by Jakob Nielsen (Nielsen, 1995).
In education, students approach concepts, ideas, and problems differently, according to
their backgrounds, experiences, and studies. For example, according to George Pólya, students
may use some of the various heuristic problem-solving techniques, when faced with a
mathematical problem like diagrams, graphs, patterns, special case analysis, or trial and error
(Pólya, 1957).
Military operations often rely on past performance results building on past military
planning practices (William, 2007).
In medicine, the ever-present "Primum non nocere" (First do no harm - a fundamental
medical precept of Hippocrates ca. 460-ca. 377 B.C.), is a telling example of the importance of
the application of heuristics. Gigerenzer confirmed the importance and validity of medical
heuristics in his analysis of heart disease predictive instrumentation. Presently, evidence-based
medicine is prevalent as a method used to clarify, improve, and standardize medical heuristics,
resulting in reduced practice variation, and optimization of the care processes. Furthermore,
according to Clement J. McDonald, "more uniform use of explicit and better heuristics could
lead to less practice variation, and more efficient medical care." (McDonald, 1996).

3.3

Heuristics as Business Processes
One way of differentiating heuristics from other reasoning methods, would be to consider

them as problem-solving methods based on formal or informal processes, and reliable or
unreliable processes.

<-----Page 50----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

39

I consider a process formal if it follows a method prescribed by a pre-defined procedure. I
consider a process reliable, to the extent that the same result is achieved when the same process
is repeatedly applied in the same circumstances. I define a law as a process that is formal and
100% reliable. Any process that does not meet the above requirements of reliability and
formality is, by definition, a heuristic process. Table 1 summarizes this categorization process.

Formal and Informal Processes.

An informal process may be different each time, leading potentially to a different and

uncertain result.
For example, the law of gravity is a 100% reliable and formal law of classical physics,
because this law is based on an invariable relationship observed between or among phenomena,
for all cases meeting specified conditions. The law of supply and demand in economics, as a
generalization based on consistent experience or results, is also formal and considered 100%
reliable.
Inductive reasoning is a heuristic following a formal process, not necessarily 100%
reliable. On the other hand, mathematical induction is not a form of inductive reasoning, but
rather a form of deductive reasoning.
‗If it is more expensive, it must be better‘ is a heuristic example following a formal but

<-----Page 51----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

40

unreliable process in applied psychology. This heuristic is often used to evaluate a perceived
value of objects. Another similar and common marketing heuristic example is ‗Price implies
quality.‘ ‗Keeping up with the Joneses‘ is an informal and unreliable process, sometimes used in
day-to-day reasoning and even in business decision-making.
Applying heuristics in business decision-making gives additional validity to that decision,
from the decision-makers perspective. The tacit reasoning associated with the use of heuristics
can support the business decision taken.
Heuristics are often associated with situations where decision makers need to act fast,
under uncertain conditions, with insufficient information. Because of this, statisticians like Jerzy
Neyman and Egon Sharpe Pearson have pointed some myths about the validity of heuristics
(Birnbaum, 1977). The most common misconceptions about heuristics include; the assumption
that heuristics represent 'second-best' results; cognitive limitations incite the use of heuristics;
heuristics are applied only in routine decisions; only people with lower cognitive capacity use
simple heuristics; more information is always better. Gigerenzer refutes those myths by
highlighting that optimization is often impossible because of estimation errors; human's
cognitive limitations are part of what characterizes the environment we live in; people with both
lower and higher cognitive capabilities rely on heuristics, and good decisions in an uncertain
world require sometimes ignoring some of the available information (Gigerenzer, 2008).
In summary, business heuristics involve some formal or informal application of rules,
processes, or methods for problem-solving, a level of incompleteness or uncertainty, and
eventually the discovery of a solution that is not necessarily 100% reliable.

businesses concerning heuristics-based decision-making reveals that understanding the dynamics
of heuristics-based decision-making in small and medium business remains a challenge because
of limited systematic scientific research on that topic.

Chapter 4: Heuristics-based Decision-making as
Knowledge Transfer
When a person makes a heuristics-based decision that person applies either personal
knowledge or knowledge acquired directly or indirectly from another person. Knowledge
acquired from another person and transmitted through heuristics is a form of knowledge transfer.
The ambiguity and lack of consistently accepted definitions of knowledge transfer is one
of the hurdles when describing heuristics as a form of knowledge transfer. Unfortunately,
knowledge management, also part of the management of knowledge transfer, is too easily
associated with tools instead of processes, or ways of thinking (Newman, 2006)..
Organizations use knowledge management as a strategy to turn their intellectual assets or
creative capital into greater productivity, new value, and increased competitiveness. However,
SMCB do not have the resources required to establish a solid base (supported either by
technology or by experts) to deal with specific knowledge transfer needed in day-to-day
operations. Moreover, most technology-based knowledge management systems use tools like
Data Mining, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence, Executive Decision Systems, Enterprise
Resource Systems, Data Pattern Recognition Systems (to name the most common ones), which
require large repositories of data and information. Some of the data collected in those
repositories is text based, making its analysis difficult. This results in high costs in technology
tools (hardware and software) and human resources (knowledge management experts),
something SMCB can hardly afford.

<-----Page 55----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

4.1

44

Tacit Knowledge
Tacit knowledge is individual. Tacit knowledge is also a process and not only a form of

knowing. Often, the daily operation of business depends on the availability of the personal
contribution and experience of the owner-manager. This experience is not stored in any database,
policy, or procedure manual. Thus, the firm depends on the owner-manager to continue to count
on experiences, behaviours, attitudes, and abilities, or competencies of that person to perpetuate
the competitive advantage of the firm or simply ensure its survival.
In the medieval ages, most apprenticeships took place in the artisan‘s workshop. A
carpenter would learn by watching his master work the wood, a stone carver would learn by
following the advice of his trainer, a tailor would mimic his instructor‘s example. One-on-one
knowledge transfer is cumbersome, time-consuming, and often impossible for SMCB executives
because of limited resources, time constraints, the fast pace of business change, and the everpresent competition.
Knowledge management, thus far, has been addressed in literature at either the
philosophical or the technical levels, with little practical methods usable by small and medium
businesses for managing and applying effectively their knowledge daily. Numerous models,
tools, and techniques are in use for effective knowledge management (Anonymous, 2010).
However, those tools focus mainly on explicit (or codified) knowledge rather than tacit
knowledge. In addition, most of the literature on knowledge management reflects the experiences
of large firms rather than small and medium businesses.
Research in knowledge management of small or medium-sized firms is still limited. This
lack of research is particularly evident when exploring the differences between the acquisition,
transfer, dissemination, and maintenance of tacit business knowledge in the context of the

<-----Page 56----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

45

owner-manager.
This study focuses on SMCB in which owner-managers often need to share their
knowledge (both tacit and explicit) with key employees if they are to grow and ensure a stable
succession planning process can take place. Owner-managers do not have resources to set up
knowledge management systems, and they are not aware of the latest scientific trends in this
area.
Macaulay and Cree suggest that instead of trying to turn this tacit knowledge into an
explicit one, it may be beneficial to transfer tacit knowledge from the owner-manager through a
process of socialization (Macaulay & Cree, 1999). Nonaka and Takeuchi suggest similar
approaches. Nonaka gives two examples in which big companies enable tacit knowledge transfer
between individuals and groups. The first, applied by Matsushita‘s Home Bakery Team consists
of creating apprenticeship teams, the second at Honda, uses sake as the transfer catalyst in out of
office social gatherings (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).

4.2 Present State of Research in Knowledge Management in Small
and Medium Business
The review of literature in the areas of knowledge management, data and information
management, tacit and explicit knowledge, personal and organizational learning, as well as
knowledge as an intangible asset to SMCB shows that the present state of research on tacit
knowledge transfer in SMCB is deficient.
Some authors explored tacit knowledge while studying knowledge management in big
firms. For example, associative thinking is also tacit learning, or learning without being able to
describe that knowledge was acquired, and therefore, difficult to share it with others. Zohar also

<-----Page 57----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

46

states, "All of us must learn a skill in our own way, for ourselves. No two brains have the same
set of neural connections" (Zohar, 1995).
Owner-managers operate mainly using tacit knowledge. Most small firms do not codify
their experiences or practices. SMCB have usually a strong corporate culture, largely derived
from the owner-manager‘s vision for the firm. Thus, understanding fully tacit knowledge and
how SMCB transfer, disseminate, absorb, and manage this knowledge is important for them.
Some work was published recently on making tacit knowledge explicit – for example, by
codifying tacit knowledge for reference librarians. Using terms as inarticulate intelligence,
collective wisdom, or elusive knowledge, the authors suggests a form of tacit knowledge transfer
using two steps: from tacit to explicit and from explicit to codified (Herschel, Hamid, & Steiger,
2001).
Sharing tacit knowledge also can be inhibited by a cultural context. Indeed, McDermott
and O‘Dell state that, in companies were knowledge is shared, knowledge management was
adapted to the culture rather than the other way around. The objective was sharing knowledge to
solve business problems (McDermott & O'Dell, 2001).
Endres and his research group compared knowledge sharing activities in the Open Source
Community with traditional organizations. They conclude that their ‗self efficacy‘ model could
serve as "a useful framework for better understanding the effects of context on tacit knowledge
sharing" (Endres, Endres, Chowdhury, & Alam, 2007).
Harlow found significant relationships between the Tacit Knowledge Level Index (TKI)
and innovation performance of firms. Although Harlow writes about an ‗operational definition‘
of TKI, he does not provide a formal definition of that index but rather the result of a series of

<-----Page 58----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

47

correlations in financial and innovation performance measures (Harlow, 2008).
Cavusgil, Calantone, and Zhao discovered similar results when studying the relationship
between tacit knowledge transfer and a firm‘s innovation capability (Cavusgil, Calantone, &
Zaho, 2008).

4.3

Knowledge Transfer: a Historical Perspective
To understand better the present nature of knowledge transfer one can go briefly back in

time, revisiting the Greeks, the Romans, and the way they addressed a similar subject using
rhetoric. Thereafter, I analyze another aspect of knowledge transfer using the military‘s
perspective – a topic of constant interest to business. Finally, I review the contemporary
literature on the subject, covering mostly the last 20 years, with a short intrusion to the first half
of the last century.
Aristotle
According to Father Bochenski, logic started with dialectics, rules for discussion and
reasoning, and in particular, rules for how to argue successfully (Bochenski, 2009). Following
Bochenski's line of thought, to better understand the present nature of knowledge transfer one
can go back in time, revisiting the Greeks, the Romans, and the way they addressed a similar
subject using rhetoric (Cocchiarella, 2001) and (Bochenski, 1953).
Whereas Aristotle has no special technical name for logic (for him logical means the
same as our probable), I argue that most of the decisions (as defendable arguments) made by
executives, follow some form of logical rule, therefore, those arguments can be presented (or
defended) as logical in the sense of defensible reasoning. Indeed, reasoning, contrary to

<-----Page 59----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

48

demonstration, can be derived from opinions, and because reasoning based on opinions is not
necessarily always correct, it can rely on heuristics.

4.4

Heuristics in Business
Applying decisions based on heuristics often leads to debate, questioning, revising, and

understanding what has happened or might happen. Applying this same method to the general
management structure and culture of our North American society means that the decision-makers
will need to argue their case in front of their reports or peers to ensure their decision is followed.
Hence, one needs to possess strong rhetorical skills when applying business heuristics to
business decision-making.
With the Worldwide Web omnipresence in our every day private and business life,
Charles Hinkle argues that:
―Value creation in the 20th century was largely defined by the conversion of heuristics to
algorithms. It was about taking a fundamental understanding of a ‗mystery‘– a heuristic – and
driving it to a formula, an algorithm – so that it could be driven to huge scale and scope"(Hinkle
& Kuehn, 1966)
Dr. Roger Martin, Dean of Rotman School of Management (University of Toronto),
proposes the following definition for heuristics:
"Heuristics are rules of thumb or sets of guidelines for solving a mystery by organized
exploration of the possibilities" (Martin, 2004)
He continues,
Heuristics do not guarantee success – they simply increase the probability of getting to a

<-----Page 60----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

49

successful outcome. They represent an incomplete understanding of a heretofore mystery.
Business people will have to become more like designers — more ‗masters of heuristics‘
than ‗managers of algorithms‘. (Martin, 2004)
Indeed, a heuristic, far from being a mystery, is a very concrete expression of one's belief
based on experience. Second, although some explicit heuristics can be derived into formulas (for
example, those based on quantitative or statistical information), tacit heuristics might sometime
resist generalization because of their reliance on information specific to one person's experience.

4.5

Military Heuristics and Business Heuristics
The marketplace has often been described as a war field; therefore, one would expect that

concepts from the military, applied to business, would be straightforward.
Carl von Clausewitz wrote,
Rather than comparing [war] to art, we could more accurately compare it to commerce,
which is also a conflict of human interests and activities; and it is still closer to politics,
which in turn may be considered as a kind of commerce on a larger scale. (Clausewitz,
1873)
However, even in its simplest description, business does not look much like war. For one
thing, business has always three sides: the company, the customer, and the competitor. In war,
usually only two sides are fighting our side and the enemy.
In the marketplace, unlike war, it may even be desirable to be conquered by a competitor
in a lucrative merger or acquisition. Soldiers have to obey orders. If they refuse, they could face
a court martial. Employees can refuse to obey. They can do so legally if the work is dangerous,
or through strikes or resignations, with usually, only monetary consequences. On the other hand,

<-----Page 61----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

50

employer‘s recourses can be lockouts, layoffs, or dismissals (firings).
Strategies and tactics of war are destructive. They rarely apply to business. Expressions
like "Attack enemy weaknesses" have no factual meaning, except as metaphors, or analogies.
Across different domains, such expressions can be misleading.
Winning in war can be achieved only if one group wins and the other one loses. Pyrrhic
victory in war is also a possible outcome. In business, winning does not mean a loss to the other
party since the war is not over. Other winning opportunities abound. The objective of business is
to survive and stay in business.
Winning wars is built around two primary themes, one with a focus on time (sometimes
also speed), using dislocations in time to shape the existing setting, and the other one on a culture
of force as an attribute that enables — even drives — armies to exploit superiority for
competitive advantage.
A similar effect of time can be different in business. The business strategy of first to
market can be disastrous for business. Opposite effects can follow, resulting with unwanted
products, disclosure of marketing strategy to the competitor, or missing the timing of a product
launch. Business attracts customers through constructive marketing and sale strategies. The
customers are those who decide whether to buy the product or service.
In business, the military strategy of the use of force is usually considered negatively.
Overpowering the marketplace often results in a counter reaction of the consumer, the
competition, or even the government. The European‘s Commission 2004 antitrust ruling against
Microsoft is a telling example of the potential consequences of market overpowerment and the
resulting reaction of the European marketplace. Coca Cola and Wal-Mart have experienced

<-----Page 62----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

51

similar negative reactions in Asia (Gentleman, 2007), (Baker, 2003) and (Hines, 2004).
If one looks at a particular group of military practitioners, like Hannibal, Julius Cesar,
Napoleon, Sun Tzu, Belisarius, Genghis Khan, T. E. Lawrence, the Blitzkrieg generals, the
Israeli Defense Force, many modern guerilla commanders, or the US Marine Corps, and
compares the heuristics expressed by those military leaders, one finds remarkable agreements
between military and business application of heuristics.
I list in table 2 some examples of military heuristics with their suggested business
interpretation. The corresponding business heuristic stemming from the study is in italics.

Business Heuristics and Knowledge Capital
Because using business heuristics in knowledge transfer can be viewed as part of the

knowledge capital of a firm, I revisit that concept in this section. This will assist later on, in
linking business heuristics to management functions (Weiss, 2007).
George Mason University professor, Paul A. Strassmann introduced and trademarked the
term Knowledge Capital. The concept of knowledge as a measurable capital of a company, was
researched under various names, such as knowledge value (Perkmann, 2002), intellectual capital
(Nick Bontis, 2001), or knowledge assets (Young & Mentzas, 2001).
The concept of knowledge capital is tied closely to the field of knowledge management.
Knowledge management is loosely defined as the activity a company needs to perform when
dealing with its knowledge, harness that knowledge, and manage it wisely, just as any other
business resource like money or material (Arenas & Lavanderos, 2008).
The idea of gathering and passing on knowledge is as old as written history, which sought
to preserve the knowledge of past civilizations. As an example, some seeds of knowledge
management are present in various medieval guilds, as artisans sought to pass on their skills and
understanding (Dempsey, 1999).
Strassmann believes that the value of employee knowledge is reflected through payroll
using traditional accounting methods. He explains that knowledge capital is a function of
employees discussing how they do their jobs. Diefenbach, on the other hand, argues that one
cannot measure knowledge, an intangible concept (Diefenbach, 2006). Strassmann replies
simply, "That is a copout […] if you cannot measure it, it does not exist" (Strassmann, 1999).
Ostro introduces the concept of Knowledge Metrics without explicitly explaining the

<-----Page 64----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

53

source of these metrics (Ostro, 1997).
Bontis puts a price on heads, work stoppages, discrimination complaints, and uses a set of
formulae to arrive at a corporation's knowledge capital and its ratio to investment capital or
shareholder equity in his controversial 1996 paper (Nick Bontis, 1996).
Based on the above interpretation of the value of knowledge, SMCB (and corporations)
must plan strategically their knowledge capital investment, and need to value the 'brain value' of
their workers, at least as highly as they value funds, equipment, facilities, or any other resource,
including equity capital. Employees and the knowledge they hold and create must be a valued
resource because only people innovate and increase productivity.
A logical starting point for any corporation in planning knowledge capital management is
to conduct a strategic analysis and quantify the capital on hand. Internal and external analyses
can help pinpoint the value of the company's knowledge.
One can measure a company's knowledge capital in a variety of ways. For example,
Strassmann starts with a company's year-end stock market valuation, or Market Value (MV). He
then subtracts the Shareholder Equity (SE), or Financial Value, to arrive at a company's
Knowledge Value. He introduces a Knowledge Capital Multiplier (KCM) - the ratio of
knowledge assets to financial assets. This ratio reflects how much shareholders expect from
intangible knowledge compared to tangible financial assets. If indeed, he is correct, and
knowledge is a resource that one must capitalize and treat as carefully as money, then corporate
managers and leaders must be able to apply management principles and functions to it.
In summary, a corporation's Market Value (MV) minus its Shareholder Equity (SE)
equals its Knowledge Value (KV). KV is then divided by the Equity Value (EV) to arrive at a

<-----Page 65----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Knowledge Capital Multiplier (KCM). KCM, when multiplied by the Knowledge Value, gives
the Knowledge Capital (KC) of the corporation.
MV - SE = KV,
KV/EV = KCM,
KCM * KV = KC
The above was summarized by Bontis in the following diagram, using Scandia as an
example

Figure 3. Assessing knowledge assets at Scandia's assurance and financial services
Source (Nick Bontis, 2001).
The Value-Added valuation of Knowledge Capital™ reflects a view that equity capital
may be available as a risky commodity based on the generally accepted Capital Asset Pricing

54

<-----Page 66----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

55

Model (Strassmann, 2005). Hence, in some circumstances, one can convert knowledge capital
into working capital. One example of the acceptance of this concept is supported by the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). Indeed, CIBC considers some form of
knowledge capital secure enough to be considered as collateral when required (Frankl, 2008).
I argue based on the few examples presented above that knowledge capital remains a
debatable topic. Considering that business knowledge and tacit business knowledge in particular,
represent a form of knowledge capital, I have found no coherent framework for conceptualizing
or organizing various forms of this knowledge capital.
Evaluating competitors' knowledge capital may be beneficial, especially because
knowledge capital is a source of competitive advantage. It also helps to know if either the
company or its competitors are likely targets of raids on valuable staff.
Therefore, an environmental analysis of the external knowledge climate like the skills of
potential employees will help in forecasting future sources of knowledge capital.
In analyzing global operations, corporations need to consider how they plan to share
knowledge and develop their knowledge capital. Databases, although important when managing
some form of knowledge, should not become the primary knowledge management tools.
Knowledge capital will exist outside information technology. Any new system planned for
storage and sharing of knowledge capital should be reviewed to ensure it could integrate data
from previous systems. Proper knowledge capital management depends in part on a firm‘s ability
to organize itself, and integrate its knowledge management both internally and externally
(McGovern, 2001).
Although business must consider multiple ways of organizing knowledge, business also

<-----Page 67----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

56

needs to know what is organizing knowledge capital, and where to allocate it. How knowledge
capital is organized can be an extremely important element depending on the way it yields a
return on investment. Information technology used need not be expensive or complex. Some of
the simplest solutions yield the highest results.
Knowledge management experts who promote the latest and greatest systems abound.
However, what is important is not the system, but the usability of the knowledge the system
contains. Systems that employees do not understand or use are not an effective return on
investment. SMCB executives face this form of challenges when they need to transfer that
knowledge to others in their organization.
An organization must make sure knowledge resources are properly allocated; to do that
requires knowing if that resource is in the right field and area of operation. A company needing
innovation in research and development is not well served if most of its knowledge capital is in
marketing. Although knowledge capital can be applied anywhere within an organization, needs
must be prioritized for the best return on capital, just as with any other resource. In general,
knowledge capital is valuable any place innovation is needed.
Not all knowledge is valuable for a business. Some knowledge is perishable and may
become outdated as technology and processes change. Some employee knowledge may not
pertain to the business. While knowing how much knowledge an organization has and where its
knowledge lies is important for that organization, it is also important knowing what is valuable
knowledge for that organization (Holsapple & Joshi, 2004).
Training can play an important role in determining what knowledge is valuable.
Management should be trained to use knowledge capital effectively, by learning what knowledge

<-----Page 68----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

57

capital is and how to manage it. Management should also be trained on attracting and retaining
knowledge capital resources, just as any other resource. Knowledge capital, like any resource, is
intended to produce results and is not an end unto itself. Knowledge capital unused is a wasted
resource.
When considering resource allocation, corporations sometimes make the mistake of
attempting to save money on information technology (IT) in an attempt to increase profit margin.
Strassmann states, however, "Even large reductions in the expenditures for computers can't
impact profits as much as a small gain in the effectiveness of information management."
Information technology should be viewed as a necessary expenditure for managing knowledge
capital (Strassmann, 2006).
Corporate management must lead the way in managing knowledge capital. This starts
with leadership decisions to invest in knowledge management systems and to value knowledge
capital as a corporate resource. Members of an organization will follow the direction of the
leaders who set the tone; if leaders value knowledge capital, the members will as well.
Management can lead the way in motivating employees, valuing employee knowledge, and
through transformational leadership. Leaders inspire and motivate their followers to meet
organizational goals, and must motivate their employees to share their knowledge with others in
the organization. Davenport writes, "The key is to think about how to motivate people to create,
share, and acquire knowledge" (Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
Leadership must value its sources of knowledge capital: its people. A healthy
corporation‘s knowledge capital transcends its payroll. Payroll may be a place to start. A
company that does not value its knowledge capital enough to retain it will lose it to companies
will to recruit valuable human resources. One indicator Strassmann uses to measure the health of

<-----Page 69----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

58

a corporation is its knowledge capital index and its human capital index. Corporations start
showing losses in knowledge capital long before productivity and profits show losses.
Other ways to ensure the retention of knowledge capital assets is through incentives,
challenges, and creative outlets. Individuals respond to different motivators: some are motivated
by recognition; others value being able to contribute to a greater purpose; still, others need
creative outlets and thrive on challenge. Management must know their employees' motivations to
choose the proper incentives that will help those employees believe they are valued and remain
with the organization.
In some organizations, the knowledge capital concept may meet with resistance and may
require transformational leadership to change the culture and bring about a new vision. This will
require patience and encouragement by management.
The systems used to manage corporate knowledge are sometimes overlooked. Jeffery
Conklin, an expert in collaborative technology research, and the Director of the CogNexus
Institute in Napa, California, states, "Many have ended up creating the electronic version of the
attic full of stuff." Much of such stuff does not qualify as knowledge. A successful management
system will need regular filtering and clean-ups (Conklin, 2010).
Climate surveys are useful tools in evaluating the climate and culture of an organization.
Surveys can be tailored to meet knowledge management and knowledge capital requirements.
Surveys, especially when anonymous, can help leadership identify and correct misconceptions
about knowledge capital (Chatzkel, 2004).
A helpful tool to follow completion of a major project or operation is the lessons-learned
session. Knowledge and knowledge capital management can easily be incorporated into such

<-----Page 70----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

59

sessions to pinpoint what went right as well as what needs improvement. Military organizations
have long conducted such sessions, often called 'hot washes', to judge campaigns and battles, and
make adjustments. Corporations often do the same, but need to adapt the concept to include
knowledge management.
SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
In addition to the internal analysis, an external analysis is helpful in determining
opportunities and threats to a company. Evaluating competitors' knowledge capital may be
beneficial, especially since knowledge capital is a source of competitive advantage. It also helps
to know if either the company or its competitors are likely targets of raids on valuable staff. An
environmental analysis of the external knowledge climate like the skills of potential employees
will help in forecasting future sources of knowledge capital.
In analyzing global operations, corporations should consider how they plan to share
knowledge and develop their knowledge capital. A corporation needs to plan how knowledge
capital will be collected and maintained. Databases, while important to knowledge management,
should not become the primary area of focus. Knowledge capital will exist outside information
technology (Strassmann, 1999). Any new system planned for storage and sharing of knowledge
capital should be reviewed to ensure it could integrate data from previous systems.
In summary, knowledge capital, as part of a benefit brought by company employees, is an
important factor in knowledge management. Knowledge transfer is therefore an essential element
SMCB need to consider when considering the use of heuristics in decision-making.

Chapter 5: Research Method and Study Design
In this chapter, I describe the research method applied, the participants in the research,
and the data collection process. I then present the coding process in detail, analyze the coding
reliability, and the coding results. Finally, I include a detailed data analysis using the proposed
coding criteria.

5.1

Background
Preliminary pilot studies I performed at the University of Victoria's Human Computer

Interface lab, showed that the few SMCB executives who participated in this pilot study use
business heuristics for business decision-making. Using these results, I developed the thesis
research in four phases: a development phase, a data collection phase, a data analysis phase, and
a reporting phase.
During the research development phase, I created 10 scenarios based on my business
experience, requiring either a business decision or a solution to a business problem. I also
developed an online survey tool to maintain objectivity and remain at arm's length with the
participants. Throughout the data collection phase, the participants took the survey and suggested
solutions for each scenario they chose to tackle. In the course of the data analysis phase, I
analyzed the solutions provided by the survey participants based on the criteria defined in the
study. Finally, I present my findings in the reporting phase.

5.2

Research Development and Data Collection Tool
The main investigation tool applied in this research was a survey in the form of an online

questionnaire consisting of 10 business scenarios. Each scenario describes briefly a business

<-----Page 73----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

62

experience I encountered during my career as a senior executive with various hi-tech Canadian
companies. The topics of the survey cover diverse situations like company valuation, cost
forecast, lawsuit, move decision, credit line downgrade, collective agreement negotiation, project
slippage, quality management, crisis management, and a joint venture opportunity. The
participants were asked to suggest solutions to the business problem(s) described in the scenario.
The participants had to:
1. Identify their gender (for statistical purposes),
2. Read a short business scenario (5-10 lines) requiring a decision,
3. Confirm if they had encountered a similar business experience during their
careers,
4. Regardless of their previous experience with the suggested scenario, describe
briefly the most probable business decision they would have made in the scenario
described, and
5. Write down the most probable rule of thumb or heuristic they would have applied
to make that decision.
To ensure anonymity and objectify of the answers, a third party directed the participants
to the survey online website. The survey participants could request a preliminary report on the
survey findings by providing their e-mail address through a separate website, therefore ensuring
they could not be associated with their answers. Furthermore, they had the opportunity to review
the research purpose, and read an online consent form, as required and approved by the
University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board (Protocol # 07-313).
I present the full survey in Appendix 1: Business Heuristics Analysis by Scenario, the

<-----Page 74----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

63

some of the detailed resulted of this research.

5.3

Survey Participants
The survey participants included three non-probabilistic distinct and pre-defined groups

consisting of University of Victoria MBA candidates, University of Victoria MBA Mentors, and
Senior SMCB executives, members of specific business associations on Vancouver Island,
namely the Vancouver Island Advanced Technology Center or the Greater Victoria Chamber of
Commerce.
Second-year University of Victoria MBA candidates symbolize future executives with
limited business experience. Although most of the participating members of this group provided
heuristics-based solutions to the business scenarios problems, none of them had experienced
firsthand the business problems described in those scenarios. These results strengthen the claim
that the chosen business scenarios represented situations encountered mostly by senior business
executives.
Business mentors volunteering at University of Victoria's School of Business represent
the second group. Members of this group were seasoned business executives, at the peak of their
career or retired.
Executives whose business is a member of either the Greater Victoria Chamber of
Commerce or Vancouver Island Advanced Technology Centre represent the third group of
participants. Members of this group typically belong to small or medium hi-tech firms or various
small or medium business firms on Vancouver Island.
All the University of Victoria MBA mentors and all senior SMCB executives have
experienced firsthand some variations of the suggested scenarios, therefore corroborating that the

<-----Page 75----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

64

business scenarios were probably common to a typical SMCB executive. The participating
business executives recommended a wide variety of heuristics-based decisions to the business
scenario problems.

5.4

Data Collection Process
The data collection process involved the following four steps. During the first step, I

developed the data collection tool and website, and communicated to the chosen third parties
(University of Victoria School of Business, the Vancouver Island Advanced Technology Center,
and the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce) the appropriate website containing the survey
data. Following this first step, the third parties communicated to their respective survey
participants the website address using their own emailing or communication system. This
ensured confidentiality and objectivity of the data collection process. Participants could choose
to provide their email address at the end of the survey form should they desire to receive a
summary report of the survey. The third parties were not involved in their member's decision
regarding this choice. In step three, once the data was uploaded to the survey's website database,
I compiled the survey data and proceeded to code the data applying coding criteria I developed
for this purpose, and analyzed the results of this coding using three different coding analysis
tools. I finally present my findings in this dissertation in step four.
I use my personal knowledge and experience to interpret the collected material, a method
supported by Trochim (Trochim, 1993). Strauss and Corbin argue that applying this type of
research analysis could result in the expression of my impressions, hence potentially being
intangible and undocumented (Corbin & Strauss, 1990). I address this concern in chapter 8, by
discussing the threats to validity of my chosen research method.

<-----Page 76----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

5.5

65

Coding Analysis Tools
I used three coding analysis tools to interpret the resulting survey's textual data.
The first coding analysis tool used in this research is the program Atlas.ti version 5.2.

Atlas.ti is a powerful workbench for the qualitative data analysis and concept mapping of large
bodies of textual, graphical, audio, and video data. This tool permits tagging and associating
memos to the data analysis process; it enables multiple coders to collaborate on a single project,
and generates output that facilitates the analysis and concept mapping process.
The second coding analysis tool is University of Pittsburgh's Qualitative Data Analysis
Program (QDAP). QDAP is a service of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Social and Urban
Research and hosted by the University Center for Social and Urban Research (UCSUR) at the
University of Pittsburgh. The Coding Analysis Toolkit (or CAT) associated with QDAP, is a
web-based suite of tools facilitating efficient analysis of text datasets.
The third coding analysis tool is the KWIC (Key Word in Context) Concordance
program, which is open-source software for Windows using Microsoft Excel.

5.6

Data Preparation for Analysis
I compiled the emailed survey results into primary Excel spreadsheets for easy sorting

and organizing the textual data. I then transferred those results to a Microsoft Word document to
delete the questions and tags, remaining only with the raw textual data.
I converted all the textual data (with obvious spelling errors corrected) into a set of
primary documents in rich text format to serve as input for the various coding analysis tools.
Textual analysis activities include compiling, segmenting, and organizing the textual data files,
and coding data segments of each primary document involved using the material available from

<-----Page 77----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

66

the survey website.

5.7

Quantitative Data
I use purposive sampling of the compiled business heuristics instead of probability

sampling because this research method allows a more detailed analysis of qualitative data.
Lincoln and Guba state that this form of sampling "is based on informational, not statistical,
considerations. Its purpose is to maximize information, not facilitate generalization. […] The
criterion invoked to determine when to stop sampling is informational redundancy, not a
statistical confidence level" (Guba & Lincoln, 2000). Table 3, summarizes the resulting
quantitative textual data downloaded from the survey website.

Note: Four participants sent incomplete survey responses commenting that the survey
was too long.
The analysis of table 4 reveals that some of the University of Victoria business mentors
and some of the business executives experienced at least one of the survey scenarios. This
substantiates the survey scenario validity by corroborating that the presented scenarios did not
represent only my business experience but rather a business experience common among the
business executives that participated in the survey.
Moreover, none of the participating MBA students experienced any of the survey's
business scenarios. This also reinforces the survey scenario validity by indicating that those
business scenarios were of the type experienced mostly by senior executives.

5.8

Business Heuristic Coding Criteria
In this section, I describe in detail the coding criteria developed to categorize the

<-----Page 79----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

68

heuristics and analyze their distribution and usage throughout the survey data.
Definition of Explicit and Tacit Business Heuristics
Business heuristics are informal rules, not intended to be strictly accurate, used to solve
business problems (Chapter 1). Business heuristics are statements (sometimes in the form of
advice or informal rule) given by businesspersons to other businesspersons in need of a solution
to a business problem. Those statements can contain explicit or tacit information. An explicit
statement is a statement that is demonstrates or expresses fully and clearly, leaving nothing
implied. A tacit statement is a statement that may contain implied or hidden information.
I define a business heuristic (BH) to be explicit (EBH), if it describes what needs to be
done in the form of an action verb, and if how to perform that action. The how determination is
satisfied if the business heuristic contains the information required to solve the business problem
or that information is readily available in literature.
Of course, although some business heuristics might not describe in detail how to perform
an action, one can easily find reliable literature describing explicitly how to perform that action.
For example, a business heuristic stating, "Do a cost/benefit analysis," is an explicit business
heuristic because doing a cost/benefit analysis is well defined in a variety of documented and
reliable online and print sources.
A business heuristic is tacit if it does not meet both conditions defining an explicit
business heuristic.

<-----Page 80----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

69

Conjecture:

A business heuristic is explicit if it satisfies the (W+) and the (H+) rules as defined hereafter:

1. The (W+) rule states that the WHAT in the business heuristic is described by at least one
action verb. I used the (W-) notation when the (W+) rule is not satisfied.
2. The (H+) rule states that the HOW in the business heuristic can be determined. I use the

(H-) notation when the (H+) rule is not satisfied.

Table 5 below summarizes the above rules.

Examples:

1. Respond quickly to client needs.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb respond is an action verb; therefore, this business
heuristic is an explicit business heuristic candidate. Checking for the (H+) rule: the adverb
quickly modifies the action verb respond, therefore, indicating HOW the response needs to be.
Hence, the above business heuristic is an explicit business heuristic.

<-----Page 81----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

70

2. Negotiate.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb negotiate is an action verb; therefore, this business
heuristic is an explicit business heuristic candidate. Checking for the (H+) rule: this business
heuristic contains no indication HOW one needs to negotiate. Hence, the (H-) rule applies. This
business heuristic is therefore a tacit business heuristic .
As per above definitions, for a business heuristic to be explicit (EXPLICIT BUSINESS
HEURISTICS - EBH) it needs to include a description of HOW the action is to be performed, or
a description of the manner in which the heuristic is to be applied. The description can suggest,
for example, by what means, by what method, in what manner, just how, exactly how, in what
way, to what extent, or in what form to perform the action.
3. A problem is also an opportunity.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb is is a state-of-being verb; therefore, this business
heuristic is a tacit business heuristic. Checking for the (H+) rule: no need to check for (H+). This
business heuristic is a tacit business heuristic.
4. Do a cost/benefit analysis.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb do is an action verb; therefore, this business
heuristic is an explicit business heuristic candidate. Checking for the (H+) rule: in this case the
HOW is determinable indirectly by the words cost, benefit, and analysis. Performing a
cost/benefit analysis is a known business process, readily available in the business literature.
Therefore, although the heuristic does not describe in detail HOW a cost/benefit analysis is done,
one can easily find reliable literature describing explicitly a cost/benefit analysis. Therefore, this
business heuristic is an explicit business heuristic.

<-----Page 82----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

71

5. Consult legal advisers for advice.
Checking for the (W+) rule: the verb consult is an action verb; therefore, this business
heuristic is an explicit business-heuristic-candidate. Checking for the (H+) rule: in this case the
HOW is determined by the form this consultation should take place - using an external entity
(legal adviser). Therefore, this business heuristic is an explicit business heuristic.
If the action verb requires a dynamic external input (usually involving others) then the
HOW is imbedded in the action verb. The example above, consult (legal advisers for advice)
illustrates HOW the action needs to be performed, for example, by involving another person.
6. Know your limit.
On the other hand, some business heuristics do not contain information HOW is one to
apply the business heuristic. If the verb is of a static, introvert form (usually self-centered), then
the HOW part of the business heuristic is missing, like in this example. Checking for the (W+)
rule: the verb know is a static verb. It does not describe an activity that needs active performing;
this business heuristic does not convey information on HOW the action needs to be performed
therefore, this business heuristic is a tacit business heuristic. Checking for the (H+) rule is not
needed here.
These decision criteria are summarized in figure 4 on the following page.

<-----Page 83----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

5.9

Dataset Preparation for Coding
The final business heuristic table compiled from the survey analysis consisted of around

16,000 words distributed in more than 2,300 statements. This original textual data was stripped
of repetitive or irrelevant information, and the remaining text was analyzed for its implicit or
tacit content using the above coding criteria.
Statements considered as comments were omitted from the coding dataset because they
contained irrelevant material for coding purposes. For example,


It seems like a small business.



Business decisions of this nature are not simply business decisions.

<-----Page 84----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING


73

I did experience a lawsuit at BMO however, it was slightly different.

Repeated or similar business heuristics were replaced by one business heuristic. For
example,


Ask questions, have questions ready



Find solutions, explore solutions



Explore alternatives, analyze alternatives

The result of this consolidation process was a dataset of around 5,000 words comprising
511 business heuristics. This resulting dataset was used in the coding process as described
hereunder.

5.10 Explicit and Tacit Coding Process
Background
The abbreviations in this section are applicable to the text only. Various figures and
tables (and the respective software applied) use slightly different abbreviations because of
software constraints.
I introduce six codes used for sorting business heuristics into tacit and explicit categories.
Those codes are:
1. WHAT_YES, (the what in the business heuristic is an action verb)
2. WHAT_NO, (the what in the business heuristic is not an action verb)
3. HOW_YES, (the how in the business heuristic can be determined)
4. HOW_NO, (the how in the business heuristic cannot be determined)

<-----Page 85----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

74

5. EB_RoT, (Explicit Business Heuristic - Rule of Thumb), and
6. TB_RoT, (Tacit Business Heuristic - Rule of Thumb).
The WHAT, HOW and B_RoT codes are exclusive, meaning that a business heuristic
could have either a" yes" or a "no" WHAT or HOW code, and either an EB_RoT or a TB_RoT
code.
EB_RoT and TB_RoT codes could have been automatically inferred from the WHAT
and HOW coding. Indeed, any business heuristic coded without both WHAT_YES and
HOW_YES codes is automatically a TB_RoT. However, this additional validation was useful in
the coding process when different coders were involved to secure a more uniform criteria
distribution process.
Each business heuristic was assigned three codes (one WHAT code, one HOW code and
one B_RoT code). The same code structure was applied during each coding of the dataset.
Table 6 on the next page summarizes the above coding distribution and the resulting
business heuristic category.

5.11 Coding Reliability Analysis
Coding qualitative data is always questionable. Is the coding criteria reliable, will
different coders arrive at similar results, is the process repeatable, does the code give out
consistent information, are some of the questions I address hereafter.
Three different coders used four identical datasets for coding to explore the reliability of
the coding criteria. Furthermore, to validate the results stemming from the chosen criteria, a
coding reliability analysis was done choosing code-by-code comparisons of three different
coding tools (Atlas.ti, QDAP-CAT, and Microsoft Excel), by looking at exact matches, overlaps,
or mismatches.
Atlas.ti Coding
Atlast.ti was used as a first mechanism to code the dataset. Atlas.ti is a powerful
workbench for the qualitative data analysis of large bodies of textual, graphical, audio, and video
data. It allows tagging and associating memos to the data analysis process, enables multiple

<-----Page 87----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

76

coders to collaborate on a single project, and generates output that facilitates the analysis
process. See below the Atlas.ti screenshot in figure 6.

Figure 5. Atlas.ti screenshot.
Qualitative Data Analysis Program (QDAP) Coding
The Qualitative Data Analysis Program (QDAP) is a service of the University of
Pittsburgh Center for Social and Urban Research and hosted by the University Center for Social
and Urban Research (UCSUR) at the University of Pittsburgh. The Coding Analysis Toolkit (or
CAT) associated with QDAP, is a web-based suite of tools facilitating efficient analysis of coded
text datasets using an internal coding module.
QDAP-CAT consists of several interactive online modules allowing researchers to upload
raw data like survey research documents, define a series of coding criteria, and proceed with
coding this data individually or using other coders with access to this tool. The QDAP and CAT

<-----Page 88----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

77

programs permit independent coding online by different coders using the same coding criteria.
Two separate coding sessions were used to explore the application of the defined coding criteria.
The resulting coded dataset files were downloaded as comma delimited files for further analysis
using Excel. Two different coders participated in the CAT program. Figure 7 presents a sample
of the QDAP-CAT screenshot.

Microsoft Excel Coding
Microsoft Excel's multiple table analysis and data tagging was the third tool used as a
validation instrument of the coding criteria. Each business heuristic was associated with its
criteria tags. The criteria was converted to one (1) applicable criteria, or zero (0), non-applicable
criteria. The resulting tables were then sorted according to each criterion. The process is
summarized in table 7, showing 2 comparative coding examples, and their resulting entries in the
comparison table.

5.12 Coding Reliability Results
I present hereafter the results of the coding reliability analysis by comparing the coding
results of two coders using the same dataset and the same coding criteria, using Fleiss's Kappa
and Kippendorff's Alpha calculations (Uebersax, 2007) and (Krippendorff, 2007).
Those results are compared later with two other coders using the Atlas.ti and Microsoft
Excel coding results.

According to Landis and Koch in the case of a few raters and a large dataset, when the Fκ values are over 0.61, the agreement between coders is considered as substantial (Landis &
Koch, 1977) .
Reliability of the Chosen Criteria using Krippendorff's Alpha calculations
I also use the Krippendorff's alpha (hereafter, K-α) method to describe the reliability of
the resulting coding between raters. Table 12 on the next page interprets the significance of the
K-α value as suggested by Landis and Koch. The alpha is usually higher when fewer categories
are present (Sim & Wright, 2005) whereas smaller samples could result in larger differences and
lower alpha (Popping, 2009) and (Kolbe & Burnett, 1991).

Because K-α > 0.667 the tentative conclusion that the coding is reliable is considered
acceptable. The results indicate that the proposed criteria were appropriate for their intended use
as an analysis tool of the consolidated business-heuristics-survey data set. Specifically, both the
F-κ and K-α values show a high level of agreement between the coders.
Similarity of the Coding Results Using the Expanded Data Sets
Four datasets were compared using a combination of comparison tools. Coding results in
column A were compiled using Microsoft Excel, those in column B used Atlas.ti, while coding
results in columns C and D were coded using QDAP CAT.
Tables 17 and 18 summarize the explicit and tacit business heuristics rules of thumb
coding differential.

The ratio between EBH and TBH was 1.33, indicating that business heuristics tend to be
more often explicit than tacit. Therefore, SMCB executives are encouraged to ask for business
heuristic when in need of a business solution, because the resulting business heuristic will
probably offer a worthwhile business solution.
Table 18 presents the standard deviation for each of the six coding criteria, showing a
WHAT standard variation of 0.020, a HOW standard variation of 0.041 and a TB versus EB RoT
standard variation of 0.068. Although low standard variations of the WHAT and HOW were
expected (see next section showing overwhelming uniformity in the use of these criteria), the
higher standard variation of the RoTs shows a relatively uniform criteria distribution for this
population sample.

The WHAT criteria is present in 87% to 92% of the codes (with an average of 88%), an

verbs as mechanisms for knowledge transfer. The knowledge transferred consists mostly of
WHAT needs to be done. See figure 7.

<-----Page 97----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

Chapter 6: Qualitative Data Analysis
In this chapter, I present a qualitative analysis of the research data.

6.1

Background
Business decisions often depend on whether they affect necessities (must haves),

possibilities (should haves), or opportunities (nice to haves). Expressions like can, could, should,
might, must, cannot, have to, want, do not want, need, require, and so on, direct the various
forms business decisions will take. A danger in making unsubstantiated decisions exists when the
problem at hand is filled with ambiguity or uncertainty, which is frequently the case in business.
Business executives often follow a three-staged decision-making process consisting in:
COLLECT => ANALYZE => DECIDE
In stage 1, the executive collects the required information for making the decision. The
collected information may be incomplete, misleading, confusing, or outright wrong.
Most often at this stage, the executive asks for advice that may take the form of a
business heuristic. In stage 2, the executive analyzes the heuristic to determine if he or she can
decide based on the collected information. In the final stage, the executive decides whether to
apply the heuristics in the decision-making process. This is, of course, the decision stage.
If the executive decides to make a decision at this stage, (usually based on objective or
subjective criteria) then the decision can be positive, negative, or neutral - where neutral means
no decision takes place, which is also a form of decision. The importance is that a decision takes
place and "we go on with business," which is a desirable outcome. If the executive cannot decide,
usually for lack of enough information, the executive will try to search for that missing

<-----Page 98----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

87

information. Therefore, more work is required. This is usually an undesirable outcome.
The research survey follows the above method with some refinement consisting in
associating to the heuristic additional data (when available). For example, the heuristic "perform
a cost/benefit analysis" implies that a competent executive knows how to perform a cost/benefit
analysis from experience or by using readily available information, filling -in the additional data
missing from the heuristic; this facilitates the decision-making process.
In most of the survey scenarios, when the participants have experienced a similar
business problem or challenge, this experience transpired through the business heuristics they
provided.
For example, the following BHs describe clearly what and how one can minimize a cash
flow problem:


Reduce the exposure of the company by maintaining draws from the client at regular
milestones.


The problem is reduced cash flow, often because of insufficient working
capital, poor credit, or deficient accounts receivable management, for
example.



The solution proposed consists of two steps: maintain (require) draws
(payments) from clients at regular intervals (milestones), which can translate
into more frequent, e.g. bi-weekly, payments.

On the other hand, in a few situations, we can infer from the proposed business heuristics
that the participant had no idea how to address the problem at hand by offering a business
heuristic that had no problem-solving value because the proposed business heuristic was either

<-----Page 99----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

88

not applicable or not relevant to the business problem at hand.
For example, the business heuristic below states simply a business fact without
suggesting either an action or a process:


Shareholders and stakeholders both benefit from a financially strong, productive, and
rewarding work environment.

In my experience as well as stemming from the survey responses, executives seldom
perform detailed analysis when facing business problems that require quick decision-making.
They usually tend to use their experience or their instinct because they often do not have enough
time to do all the required due diligence or information search. This means that a business
heuristic needs to be easy to implement, therefore, the business heuristic needs to contain
sufficient decision-making information to be useful to the business executive.

6.2

Business Heuristics Categories and Families
Applying the above analysis to the survey's business heuristics, I distinguish two business

heuristics categories: explicit business heuristics and implicit (tacit) business heuristics. Each
category consists of two business heuristics families. Explicit business heuristics comprise
complete and incomplete heuristics. Implicit business heuristics include rules of thumb and
experience-based business heuristics. Figure 9 summarizes this business heuristics distribution.

<-----Page 100----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

89

Figure 9. Explicit and Implicit business heuristics categories and families.

6.3

Explicit Business Heuristics: Qualitative Data Analysis
Using the above categorization, between 45% and 63% (with an average of 57%) of the

survey's business heuristics are explicit. Explicit business heuristics contain both an action verb
and a determinable method of implementing the proposed heuristics.
I subdivide E-BHs into two families consisting of complete explicit business heuristics
(the CE-BHs family) and incomplete explicit business heuristics (the IE-BHs family).
Complete explicit business heuristics (CE-BHs) contain all the information required for

<-----Page 101----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

90

solving the business problem at hand.
For example:


When producing something, it is important to make sure every single detail is
adequately satisfied in accordance with the company's regulation.
(when addressing production quality control)



Win-Win negotiation is an important business strategy.
(when negotiating with a union)



Work with the team toward finding a solution.
(when trying to find a solution to a product defect)



Apply 5-6 times sales for business valuation, and At least 65% of the purchase
price needs to be in cash or near-cash.
(when negotiating a company's market value)

CE-BHs are the easiest explicit business heuristics to implement when trying to solve
business problems. They contain the action and the process leading to a solution; therefore, they
can readily assist the decision-making process and the decision maker.
Most business people are known for their frugality in dispensing advice. CE-BHs
represent good examples of this form of business advice.
About 2/3 of the survey's E-BHs belong to the CE-BHs family.
Incomplete EBHs (IE-BHs) imply that some of the knowledge needed to solve the
business problem is either readily available or is common knowledge. For example:

<-----Page 102----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING


91

Admit the problem/mistake, offer to make reparations, and seek to remove
attorneys from the situation.
The business executive is supposed to know how to admit a mistake and how to
make reparations, no need to describe the process here.



An allowance for doubtful accounts is an unfortunate reality in business, and you
must be prepared for it.
The business executive is expected to know how to deal with doubtful accounts.

The IE-BHs below contain suggestions readily available from various business support
resources - like small business websites, business books, or known business processes.


Develop a better Quality Assurance System.
Information about Quality Assurance Systems is available, for example, through
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9000)



Add contingency to project.
Various forms of contingency application to projects are available using, for
example, the Project Management Knowledge Base, or the Project Management
Institute.



Calculate cost-benefit.
A cost-benefit analysis is a term that refers to a method applied in assessing the
financial validity of a business investment. A cost-benefit analysis is a readily
available tool for making various business decisions, using various financial

<-----Page 103----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

92

management business resources. One such source is the online, free, CostBenefit-Analysis Newsletter.
Incomplete EBHs require the business executive to seek for further information or
clarification if he or she is not familiar with the process proposed. However, in most cases, the
process is readily obtainable from widely accessible resources on the Internet or business
manuals, for example. About 1/3 of the survey's E-BHs are I-EBHs.

6.4

Tacit Business Heuristics Families: Qualitative Data Analysis
Between 37% and 55% (with an average of 43%) of the survey's business heuristics were

deemed tacit, which means that they were lacking either the WHAT (action verb), or the HOW
(determinable process), or both.
I identify two tacit business heuristics (TBHs) families based on the WHAT-HOW
criteria.
The first TBHs family stems when applying the WHAT-NO/HOW-NO and the
WHAT_NO/HOW_YES criteria. I name those business heuristics, business rules of thumb, or BRoTs.
The second TBHs family is characterized by the WHAT-YES/HOW_NO criteria. I name
this BHs family experience-based business heuristics or EB-BHs.
Both TBHs families are described hereafter.
The B-RoTs TBHs family
About 64% of tacit business heuristics fit in the WHAT-NO/HOW-NO criteria,
characterized by the absence of an action verb, and a determinable implementation method.

<-----Page 104----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

93

The B_RoTs state a rule (a 'business reality') without describing the corresponding action.
B_RoTs are often incomplete business heuristics, hence tacit. They do not define how they need
to be implemented because they contain neither an action verb nor a determinable process of
implementing the business heuristic. Experienced executives may infer what needs to be done
when considering those rules, whereas less experienced executives may need additional
information to use those rules effectively for business problem solving.
Because tacit business heuristics do not contain enough explicit information about how to
proceed implementing the heuristic, tacit business heuristics require either some previous
experience in solving the particular business problem at hand, (which may translate into steering
the decision process in the 'right' direction), or additional information needed to solve the
business problem at hand. For example:


Clients do not pay sometimes
As a RoT, a businessperson needs to consider that clients do not pay sometimes,
tacitly stating that a business needs to count with this potential drawback by
planning for write-offs.



Business relationships are important
As a RoT, maintaining good business relationships is beneficial for a company;
therefore, they are important - especially when problems arise.



Whatever can go wrong usually does.
As a RoT, situations can deteriorate; therefore, one implies the need for
contingency plans as options that may mitigate the problem situations when
something goes wrong.

<-----Page 105----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

94

Less than 3% of tacit business heuristics fit into the WHAT_NO/HOW-YES criteria,
characterized by the absence of an action verb, with, paradoxically, suggesting a determinable
implementation method. In those instances, the tacit business heuristic is considered also a
B_RoT because the business heuristic take the form of a rule in which the action verb is part of
the description process rather than a separate activity. For example:


Redundancy is not always bad.
Rule of thumb: have a redundancy in your processes.



Quality must be built into every process of an organization, so a lapse in quality
usually means a lapse in process.
Rule of thumb: build a quality assurance in your process.



People work best when confronted with a penalty for non-performance or reward for
over-performance.
Rule of thumb: apply a performance appraisal management system containing a
reward/penalty element.



Being a leader does not mean to dominate every single aspect of the detail.
Rule of thumb: avoid micro management. Do not go too much into detail.

About two-third of the tacit business heuristics (67%) fall into the B-RoTs family.
The Experience-Based TBHs family
The WHAT_YES/HOW_NO business heuristics family is characterized by the presence
of an action verb, and the absence of a determinable process because the HOW is not
determinable. These TBHs are useful to those executives that have some experience with the

<-----Page 106----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

95

business problem they are facing. The business heuristic provider assumes that the experienced
executive knows how to perform the required action. Of course, the less experienced executive
will need more information to problem-solve the problem at hand.
We name this TBHs family Experience-Based Tacit Business Heuristics or EB-TBHs.
They represent about one third of the survey's TBHs.
Examples:


Work to improve the assets you have.



Watch out for competition.



Validate your information.



Validate the buyer.



Use common sense.



Understand your responsibilities.



There is always a way to borrow money.



Take risk in business.



Mitigate damages.

A complete list of the survey's B_RoTs and EB-TBHs is presented in Appendix 5.

Chapter 7: Business Heuristics Applied to
Management Functions
7.1

Background
This section presents business heuristics as they relate to the presently widely accepted

concept that management operates by applying four management functions, which are: planning,
organizing, directing, and controlling (Bateman & Snell, 2002) and (Weiss, 2007).
Other authors use similar terms for describing those management functions. For example,
some authors use staffing instead of organizing, and leading or motivating instead of directing,
and coordinating instead of controlling (Drucker, 1999). Henry Fayol has identified seven
management functions, splitting some of the above into two (Fayol, 1966). However,
contemporary management literature considers that most management functions fall within the
four functions introduced above. I present those four management functions hereafter.
Planning is the ongoing process of developing the long-term and short-term business
mission and objectives and determining how to achieve them.
Directing is establishing the internal organizational structures required to achieve the
planning objectives. It includes staffing all business positions in the business. Recruiting, hiring,
training, evaluating, and compensating are also part of this function.
Organizing is leading by influencing people's behavior through motivation,
communication, inspiration, and support. The purpose of leading is to channel employee
behavior to meet the organization's mission and objectives while helping them achieve their own
career objectives.

<-----Page 108----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

97

Controlling is a process that directs the activities of individuals toward the achievement
of organizational goals. Controlling includes establishing performance standards, measuring
them, and taking appropriate action when those standards are met or not.
Business heuristics resulting from the study, be they explicit, (complete or incomplete),
or tacit, (rules of thumb or experience-based), can relate to those management functions.

7.2

Business Heuristics Distribution by Management Functions
In this section I analyze how business heuristics resulting from the study, be they

explicit, (complete or incomplete), or tacit, (rules of thumb or experience-based), relate to those
four management functions.
Considering that some business heuristics can be associated with two or more
management functions whereas other business heuristics are associated with exclusive
management functions, one would expect to end up with 16 distribution possibilities: the sum
of all the combinations of 4 functions as per below:
4 4
4
4
4
4
4
𝑖=1 𝐶𝑖 = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 2 = 16

where Ci (i = 1 to 4) represent each management function.
Of course, C0 does not apply because business heuristics not associated with any
management function are statements of no interest to the study. However, when associating
business heuristics to their respective management functions one notices that several of the
above combinations are absent. The absent combinations are highlighted in the following truth
table, where P, O, D, and C represent respectively the PLANNING, ORGANIZING,
DIRECTING, and CONTROLLING management functions, and(-P), (-O), (-D), and (-C)

<-----Page 109----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
indicate the absence of relationship between the business heuristic and the respective
management function.

The absent management functions are preceded with the negative sign in curly brackets.
Interpretation of the above results gives the following:
The first three absent PODC combinations suggest that no business heuristics are

associated with (PO and D) and not with (C), or with (PO and C) and not with (D), or with
(PO) and not with (C and D). We infer from this that the PLANNING and ORGANIZING
functions are highly related to most business heuristics.

98

<-----Page 110----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

99

The last three absent combinations suggest that no business heuristics are associated
with (OC) and not with (PD), or with (DC) and not with (PO), or with (D) and not with (POC).
This highlights the importance of the P function.

7.3 Interpretation of Business Heuristics Relation to Management
Functions
For this analysis, I use the four functions of management as reference codes. Each
action verb within each business heuristic relates to one or more management functions.
For example:


Find information is an action verb appearing in business heuristics associated
with all four management functions of PLANNING, DIRECTING,
ORGANIZING, and CONTROLLING.



Manage QA (Quality Assurance), on the other hand, appears only in business
heuristics associated with DIRECTING, ORGANIZING, AND CONTROLLING.



Plan need appears only in business heuristics associated with PLANNING.

The resulting quantitative tables below summarize the relations between business
heuristics and management functions, once the survey business heuristics have been stripped
from obvious duplications.

In table 20 and figure 10 on the next page, we notice that the ratio between explicit and
tacit business heuristics resulting from the study is approximately 2/3 to 1/3 or 2 to 1. Indeed,

<-----Page 111----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

100

responses by executives participating in the study tended to contain explicit business heuristics
two times more often than tacit ones. Explicit business heuristics are easier to apply that tacit
ones - especially if the advised party lacks the experience needed to interpret the tacit business
heuristics.
A consequence of the above is that it may be useful to compile explicit business
heuristics tables - because they may not require additional interpretations for the reader, as
those business heuristics are self-explanatory.

On the other hand, how would we treat tacit business heuristics? To answer this
question I analyze in more detail the composition and distribution of tacit business heuristics
families below.
Distribution by Management Functions
Rules of thumb representing business heuristics having no direct association to specific
management functions are added to this analysis, for completeness. The resulting table 21
below reflects the adjusted distribution of business heuristics by management functions.

Discussion:
The data in table 21 and figure 11 show that over 1/3 of the business heuristics are
associated with the planning process, and 1/5th of the business heuristics cover the directing
and controlling functions. Finally, about 1/10 of business heuristics address organizing
functions and 1/10th are rules of thumb.
Planning is the management function most often addressed in the study. Directing and
controlling management functions share similar business heuristics coverage. Organizing is the
management function that has been addressed the least.
The above distribution may be a reflection of the type of challenges covered by the
study scenarios. Indeed, those scenarios were addressing strategic management issues rather
than operational ones. Organizing as an operational function has not been a major issue in the
study scenarios.
On the other hand, strategic issues have been at the forefront of the study scenarios,
therefore one can expect that the study participants have applied the functions of planning,
directing, and controlling more often than the organizing function.

Chapter 8: Threats to Validity
Some qualitative researchers reject the framework of validity commonly used in
traditional quantitative methods. For example, Guba and Lincoln question the concept of
"validity" in qualitative research (Guba & Lincoln, 2000). They proposed four criteria they
believe are better alternatives to the traditional ones of Cook and Campbell (Cook &
Campbell., 1979). Their proposed qualitative criteria could replace or complement the
quantitative criteria as presented in the table below. Their proposed qualitative criteria could
replace or complement the quantitative criteria as presented in the table below.

Traditional Criteria for Judging Qualitative Research
Traditional criteria in judging quantitative research addresses conclusion validity,

<-----Page 115----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

104

Internal Validity Threats.
One of this study‘s limitations is the choice and the limited sample of participants.
Because the survey targets a limited number of expert participants from each group, this choice
precludes one from generalizing the findings to all SMCB executives.
External Validity Threats.
If a causal relationship exists between the constructs of the cause and the effect, one
cannot necessarily generalize this effect to other people or business scenarios. However, one
expects to find some common behavioral denominators ideally through some form of theory
saturation.
Reliability Validity Threats.
The study is based on perception. Typical experimental psychology effects of
perception, thinking, and problem-solving associated with each participant, can further
constrain the survey results on the grounds that each participant has to imagine the scenario in
question and identify with its hypothetical and sometimes incomplete parameters. The scenario
approach relies on analogies rather that real business situations.
Objectivity Validity Threats
Reliance on recollection/memory is another limitation of the study. The business
scenarios used require a dependence on implicit or explicit memory and are subject to the
effects of memory loss, emotional effect on memory, or other elements affecting memory like
specific experiment circumstances, disturbances, or distractions. This may lead to biased
information hence infirming some of the study conclusions.

<-----Page 116----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

105

Alternative Criteria for Judging Qualitative Research
Alternative criteria in judging qualitative research address credibility threats,

transferability threats, dependability threats, and confirmability threats.
Credibility Threats
Credibility threats involve establishing that the results of the qualitative study are
believable from the perspective of the participants of the research.
The study participants have expressed readily their understanding of the proposed
scenarios, either implicitly by participating constructively in the study, or explicitly in direct emails to me; therefore, I presume that the results are credible. On the other hand, the sample
population was limited to an expert group, and I cannot necessarily conclude that this would
have been the case in any other similar circumstances.
Transferability Threats.
Transferability deals with the capability of generalizing (or transferring) the results of
the study to other settings. Transferability depends on the one doing the study. Because this
study is the first of its kind, further research is needed to claim transferability in this case.
Dependability Threats.
The traditional view of reliability considers the replicability or repeatability of the
study. In qualitative research, one cannot replicate exactly any case under study.

<-----Page 117----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

106

Confirmability Threats.
Confirmability indicates the level of corroboration of the study results. Although several
strategies can be used for that purpose, the most common one would be to search and describe
(if found) examples that contradict the finding. Similar to external validity threat, assuming a
causal relationship exists between the constructs of the cause and the effect; one cannot
necessarily generalize this effect to other people or business scenarios.

Chapter 9: Conclusion and Discussion
This study explored various forms of applying business-heuristics in decision-making in
SMCB based on a set of 10 scenarios used in a targeted survey.
Thirty-nine participants composed of University of Victoria MBA student, University
of Victoria Business Mentors and Vancouver Island small business executives participated in
the study. More than 20,000 words summarizing about 2,500 heuristics were collected and
summarized into 511 business heuristics. Those business heuristics were categorized according
to criteria based on an action verb and a determinable process.
The analysis of the survey results lead to the identification of two business heuristics
categories (explicit and tacit) each containing two different business heuristics families; explicit
business heuristics are composed of the complete explicit business heuristics family (CE-BHs
family) and the incomplete explicit business heuristics family (IE-BHs family). Tacit business
heuristics are composed of the business rules of thumbs (B-RoTs) and the experience-based
tacit business heuristics family (EB-TBHs).
The study results suggest that the design of the research survey was valid.
Indeed, all the business executives participating in the survey had experienced at least
one the survey scenarios, whereas none of the MBA students had experienced any of the survey
scenarios. This suggests that the scenarios were those experienced typically by senior
executives rather than entry-level managers (represented by the MBA students).
The study results suggest also that the sample population was appropriate and provided
reliable data.

<-----Page 119----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

108

The two control groups representing senior SMCB executives had very similar
experiences with the study scenarios, suggesting that they represented an adequate control
group for this type of survey.
Furthermore, the study results suggest that the research hypothesis is valid, namely that
executives use rules of thumb in the form of business-heuristics in their decision-making
process.
Most executives participating in the survey provided business heuristics or rules of
thumb as problem-solving suggestions potentially leading to business decisions. A few
executives found the survey too long and provided only partial answers to the survey. None of
the participants found any of the survey scenarios inadequate examples of challenges SMCB
executives have to face in their daily business decision-making requirements.
Finally, the study results suggest that some of the tacit business heuristics can be
converted into explicit ones by either adding an action or including a determinable
implementation process, or both.
In table 23 on the following 3 pages, I present a sample list of 36 business heuristics
with an interpretation of each.

Chapter 10: Future Work
Research findings of this study confirm that the business scenario approach and the use
of business heuristics as business decision-making tools because they are presumable, realistic,
and practical in general.
If knowledge in all its forms is a capital asset for SMCB, a method for organizing
various forms of this capital as business heuristics, can deliver significant benefits to those
businesses.
Future research could lead to the development of a valuable tool in the form of a wikibusiness heuristics to respond to the need of more readily available business heuristics.
Moreover, future work could also be targeting a wider range of SMCB beyond
Vancouver Island to gain a model applicable to a wider variety of small and medium
businesses.

Appendix 1: Business Heuristics Analysis by Scenario
In the following section, we review some of the proposed business heuristics for each of
the survey's scenarios. Business heuristics underlined for easier identification. Each scenario's
description is included for quick reference.

Scenario 1 Company Valuation Data Analysis
The first business scenario (Company Valuation) asked the following question:
As the CEO of a small software business ($2M in revenues, 10 employees), you have
been approached by an unknown "intermediary" claiming to represent a company interested in
acquiring your business.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above-described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
Recurring themes emerging from reading the suggested business heuristics in the first
scenario gravitate mostly around two needs: the need for more information (a decision is not
made without additional information–a decision in itself), and the need for trust (a decision is
not made without validating the buyer–another way of requiring additional information).
The need for more information is expressed directly ("I would require more
information," and "Request further information, name of referral, plans if business is acquired,"
and so on) or indirectly ("It would depend on the offer" or "I would also want to know much

<-----Page 126----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

115

more about the acquiring company"). This approach is further supported by the underlying
business heuristic:
Verify sources and information before making a decision.
Validating the buyer is prevalent in this scenario. For example, the need for validations is
expressed in"Validate the buyer" or "Determine if the intermediary is legitimate," or "Always
qualify the person that you are dealing with," or "Do due diligence," and "Do not take anything
for granted."
All those business heuristics express the need for more information. Other actions are
also suggested, like, listen, discuss, build relationship, negotiate, consult, contact, ask, and meet.
Those actions mostly relate to communication behaviors. Finally, some actions point to critical
thinking, such as analyze, evaluate, define, and get second opinion.
Hints at typical financial business heuristics are also present, like: minimum purchase
price (5 times annual revenue, 65% cash), length of the process (3 months), follow business plan,
fiscal implication, need for confidentiality (non-disclosure agreement - NDA) or maximize
shareholder value.

Scenario 2: Cost Forecast Data Analysis
The second business scenario (Cost forecast) asked the following question:
Your chief engineer has presented to you his cost estimate for a new production
workstation to be implemented within three months. You feel that those estimates are too low and
the time frame too short, once again. You need to decide how to address those issues with your
chief engineer, taking into account that he is one of the key people in your company and that
your client expects results since your company is the only one with the required technology and
knowledge to address their needs.

<-----Page 127----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

116

Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
In this scenario, one theme predominates: the need for discussion, followed by the need
for outside help, and the need for contingency planning.
When the predicament is outside the control of the decision-maker (in this scenario only
the chief engineer can deliver the goods), the best approach is to discuss (in this quandary
"discuss" implies negotiate a mutually acceptable solution), followed by developing a
contingency plan (have alternatives if business does not evolve as planned) coupled with getting
outside help if possible.
The following business heuristics have been suggested:
Promise less, deliver more.
The understanding here is that the client will be better served if he gets more than
expected–in quality or quantity ref:"Baker’s dozen"
Get it right the first time.
Fixing mistakes is more costly than preventing them.
Hold people accountable.
Accountability increases self-confidence and reliability, instead of pointing the blame at
someone
If no consensus, direction must be given.
This business heuristics remind of the known saying:"The buck stops here”–attributed to

<-----Page 128----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

117

US President Trumann (Mitford, 1957); the executive needs to assume full responsibility for the
company, hence the executive has the power of last resort.

Scenario 3: Lawsuit Data Analysis
The third business scenario (Lawsuit) asked the following question:
Your secretary has informed you that a major client is on the phone. You have just picked
up your phone to greet your client when an irate voice on the other end informs you that this
client is going ahead with a lawsuit against your company. The new product delivered failed
catastrophically and the client incurred a major loss. You know this client very well and you are
pretty sure that his claim is well founded.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
One theme overshadows the others: take responsibility, complemented by "The client is
always right." Some effort in listening, seeking help and mitigating loss (damage control, avoid
lawsuit) is also present.
Other suggested business heuristics include:
The customer is always right.
This expression has become a cliché in the industry; applying it verbatim can become
impossible at times (especially when the client is not right).
Resolve without court system particularly if you are wrong.

<-----Page 129----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

118

Lawsuits are only good for the lawyers.
Innocent until proven guilty. Do not jump to conclusions before reviewing the
information.
Learn from the mistake, Experience talks, or do not make the same mistakes too often.
Honesty is always the best policy, Dialogue is always better than adversarial
approaches.
One needs to remember that in the US business tends often to use a "Win-Loose"
strategy, instead of "Win-Win" one. One needs to consider this when dealing with somewhat
"antagonistic" counterparts.
Direct reasons for issues are never obvious.
Experience shows that people tend to hide their true needs–therefore, one needs to
identify them through dialogue, and keep an open mind–avoiding judgmental reasoning: a
technique often difficult to achieve without adequate training.

Scenario 4: Move Decision Data Analysis
The fourth business scenario (Move decision) asked the following question:
Your plant has had a vigorous growth in the past three years and expansion plans have
been on the book for some time. You are only waiting for the right opportunity to increase your
manufacturing floor space. This opportunity came up today. You real estate agent called to
inform you that the space you coveted came up for sale and several suitors are already interested
in it. You feel the need to come to a quick decision on this matter.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in

<-----Page 130----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

119

your decision.
Discussion
The recurring theme is "Take advantage of business opportunities."
The main messages are based on the following business heuristics:
Be prepared to make a decision when the opportunity arises,
meaning that change happens quickly; hence decisions need to be quick. Often the
opposite is true in big corporations.
He who hesitates is lost, similar to Strike while the iron is hot.
On the other hand, a need for "more information" and "due diligence" is present here too.
Hasty decisions may lead to mistakes. (―Do not get caught in any hysteria,"“Do not jump”).
Therefore, the suggested business heuristics contradict some of the previous ones.

Scenario 5: Credit Line Data Analysis
The fifth business scenario (Credit line) asked the following question:
Your bank manager has just called informing you that based on the last quarter’s
financial performance of your company; your company’s line of credit is being reduced from
$750,000 to $400,000. You have two weeks to comply or your demand loan (the whole amount)
will become due. You are aware that your partner and yourself (sharing the company 60/40)
have the required $350,000 in forms of portfolio and/or equity (house values). You have been
reluctant to offer your house as collateral, mostly because your wife is strongly opposed to it.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in

<-----Page 131----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

120

your decision.
Discussion
In this complex setting, participants agree that personal assets (like the house) should be
kept outside the business.
An "aparte" appears in several cases where the concept of:"If I do not believe in my
business why anybody else should?" is put forward. This implies total commitment–as in:"In for
a penny, in for a pound.”
The suggested business heuristics include:
Do not go outside your risk/comfort zone,
based on "gut feelings" since the "comfort zone" may vary for every individual.
When decisions affect others, those others must have a voice in the decision.
This business heuristic suggests a specific cooperative management style: involving
others in the decision-making, a process not necessarily generalizable, albeit reasonable here.
Keep the debt at a manageable level.
Although a wise suggestion, statistics shows that a large number of small businesses still
have a short life span of less than 5 years (StatisticsCanada, 2010).
Keep personal assets out of business.
This heuristic contradicts the on-going policy applied by banks. Banks often require
personal guarantees from SMCB owners, making the above suggestion sometime difficult to
apply.
Every problem has a solution.
This business heuristic sounds more like "wishful thinking" than reality. Entrepreneurs
need to remain optimistic and seek solutions, sometimes difficult to find. This cannot be

<-----Page 132----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

121

generalized.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Here, the business heuristic implies that "risk is worth taking." It contradicts some of the
other proposed business heuristics, making the generalization of this one less plausible. Risk is a
"personal" and "emotional" element, risk-taking is therefore, also personal and emotional.
Anticipate the worst.
This business heuristic implies that, when taking risk, one should look at the worst-case
scenario, and evaluate if the outcome is within the decision-maker‘s comfort zone. Worst case
scenarios are often associated with life and death situations. In business, this may relate to
staying in business (staying alive) or going bankrupt (dying). No decision is suggested here, just
a "gut feel."

Scenario 6: Collective Agreement Data Analysis
The sixth business scenario (Collective agreement) asked the following question:
Your union representative has informed you that the union is ready to go on strike if their
last demand regarding an increase in benefits about their RRSP contribution is not met. The
final clause needs to include a 2% increase in company’s contribution to the employee’s RRSP,
i.e. it is going up from the present 5% to 7%. The employee’s contributions remain at 5%. This
means an increase in $200,000 in additional costs to the company or 20% of expected gross
profit, all other things being equal. Furthermore, this is a three-year contract.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above-described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.

<-----Page 133----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

122

Discussion
The main message in this scenario is "negotiate." In some instances, additional
information is sought for–to negotiate better.
The underlying message is one that suggests an adversarial approach instead of a
cooperative one, exactly what one needs to avoid. This might not be surprising since only two of
the participants have actually experienced a similar scenario.
In this case, executives did not hesitate to provide advice even if their personal
experience did not include this scenario, which was reflected by the business heuristics they
proposed. Their heuristic, if followed, would only worsen the outcome. Here a need for "expert
advice" is critical since the consequence can be disastrous for the company: a strike, to be
avoided if possible.
The suggested business heuristics include:
Negotiate.
Negotiation is always a best first option. The objective is to find a "win-win" solution
(suggested by one participant).
Quid pro quo.
This is more difficult to achieve since the parties start on an adversarial footing. The
objective is to find common ground beforehand. Here, an external resource specialized in this
subject comes in handy.
Draw the line.
This suggestion is definitely to be avoided here. It opens alternative antagonistic avenues,
and is conducive to an "open war" (in military terms). The executive needs to avoid open
conflict, and rather use a conciliatory tactic that brings the parties closer to each other. Knowing

<-----Page 134----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

123

the "adversary" is a better method (again borrowed from the military).
Get advice. (Analyze alternatives).
Definitely: getting expert advice is probably the most common denominator in the
suggested scenarios. This was mentioned only sporadically, mostly by those with experience in
the matter.

Scenario 7: Project Slippage Data Analysis
The seventh business scenario (Project slippage) asked the following question:
During your regular weekly meeting today with your client, your client has expressed
concerns over the delivery date of the expected 72 ft top of the line powerboat now in
construction. You have seen the construction of this latest vessel slip steadily over the past six
months. Although the delivery date is still another six months away, you are aware that this is a
fixed bid and that any delay in construction will affect the profitability of this project.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
The most difficult problem addressed in this scenario concerns dealing with people (the
project manager) not performing as expected.
Suggestions include buy-ins (from client or employees), honesty (with client and
employees), and closer management (keeping an eye on things, documenting well, monitoring
progress).

<-----Page 135----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

124

Some wishful thinking permeates, indicated by business heuristics like, All is possible; It
is usually just a function of money, time, and a sense of urgency.
This approach is unlikely to provide acceptable solutions since the project is in deep
trouble already. It is over budget, over schedule, and underperforming.

Scenario 8: Quality Management Data Analysis
The eighth business scenario (Quality management) asked the following question:
Your latest shipment of goods was returned today attributable to poor quality. This
return represents a major revenue loss to you as well as a credibility problem with your client.
You have had some minor quality problems in the past and delegated the responsibility of
addressing them to your plant manager. Based on recent shipments, you thought that this
problem was addressed by your plant foreman. This return shows that flaws in the production
process are still present.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
This scenario is similar to the "project slippage" one. The bottom line: quality is #1.
Some rules of thumb suggested in this case include:
Quality must be assured.
You need quality processes, implement a continuous QA process, do it right NOW,
customer service is critical, have checks and balances.

<-----Page 136----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

125

All these highlight the importance of managing quality in the workplace.
Avoid the blame game, rather use an outcome frame to problem solve.
Avoiding the blame game is an important management style that empowers employees to
do a better job. When mistakes are made (and we know that "errare humanum est"),
management focuses on the processes involved to correct them, instead of on "pointing fingers"
as in "who is going to be blamed now?"

Scenario 9: Crisis Management Data Analysis
The ninth business scenario (Crisis management) asked the following question:
You hear from your broker this morning that your investment in XYZ shares (one of your
major clients) just lost all value. XYZ declared bankruptcy in Arizona yesterday. Not only have
you invested in that company (not a major amount but enough to show interest in XYZ future
since they choose your company as their main supplier of silicon belts) but also your latest
shipment worth over $40,000 CDN was still not paid. Luckily, you had all your U.S. shipments
insured by Export Development Canada (EDC). However, this will affect your cash flow as well
as your line of credit with the bank.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please
describe briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write
down the most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in
your decision.
Discussion
In this scenario, the company is affected by an outside event: an important customer has
gone bankrupt. The shipment of goods is unpaid. However, the shipment was insured, therefore,

<-----Page 137----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

126

no loss was incurred.
Only two executives have mentioned that they have had a similar experience. They were
also the only two who gave proper advice: inform your banker! Other suggestions or remarks
show a poor understanding of the difficulty faced.
―Stuff happens‖–(is this an advice or a statement?)
―Diversify‖–(after the fact?)
―Risk of doing business‖–(a statement?)
―Don’t panic‖–(and?)
The message is "doing business involves risk" and one needs to deal with it. Three
business heuristics stand out: Know your customers; Do not put all your eggs in one basket, and
Redundancy is not always bad.
Duplication, even if costly, can be beneficial.

Scenario 10: Joint Venture Data Analysis
The tenth business scenario (Joint venture) asked the following question:
Your technology training company with headquarters in Victoria has expanded nicely in
the last three years, opening branches in Vancouver, Prince George, and Kelowna. You got a
phone call from the dean of Okanagan College, inviting you to visit this institution to discuss a
potential joint project in delivering technology training in that region. The meeting will need to
be done the next day to meet the budget deadlines the institution is facing.

Appendix 3: Business Heuristics List
Survey participants have suggested more than 1,000 heuristics-based decisions for the
proposed scenarios. These heuristics do not need to be associated with specific scenarios since
similar heuristics can apply to different situations. For example, consult someone, under-promise
over-deliver, do not put all your eggs in one basket, are examples of generic heuristics
applicable to a variety of business challenges. Some non-heuristic suggestions are simply general
statements or comments containing no specific action or rule. Other heuristics suggest finding
more information indicating that sometimes it is safer to abstain from making a decision rather
than making one based on incomplete information. Heuristics in the form of rules rather than
actions may apply to other situations besides the problem at hand. A decision is possible by
applying the rule. The decision can be postponed. No decision can also be the outcome.

Each of the heuristic can be either explicit, in which case it clearly states the action to be
taken, or tacit, in which case at least part of the action to be taken is not clearly defined.

Duplicate heuristics are removed. The heuristics are listed in alphabetical order for quick
reference.

<-----Page 143----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
Survey Business Heuristics List
List of participants' heuristics in alphabetical order (for quick reference)

1.

[…] I would see if there was any way to avoid the lawsuit by dealing with the
client's needs

2.

[Also,] Discuss situation with client and determine how to rectify situation with
them [However at the same time] I would remind the client that we would not
permit slander or liable statements to be made, as they would negatively affect
my business

3.

[Also,] try to be as sensitive and as supportive as possible to employees -they're the heart, mind and soul of the organization

4.

[Also] Ask what barriers they see between themselves and the goal

5.

[Anyway], the first thing I would do is call my counsel and follow not only the
letter but also the spirit of the law

6.

[Either that or] I would turn the plant manager‘s salary into a ownership plan so
that he/she could clearly understand how much money the company can lose for
poor quality control

7.

[In addition,] When conflict exists, it is important to figure it out by looking at
the bigger picture

8.

[Moreover,]When people make a mistake, it doesn't mean anyone wins because
unless the team can start working toward in the best interest of the company,

132

<-----Page 144----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
everyone loses
9.

[Once verified,] I would ask for more details on the acquisition (why, when,
how, what, etc.) and evaluate the proposition on its fit for our company

10.

[See above] Anticipate the worst

11.

[The second thing I would do is] Talk to my wife, if and only if, the company
decided that we were going to move ahead

12.

[Then,] I would try to get more details on what actually happened, how our
product was involved

13.

[Then] I may need a lawyer to get ready for the property transfer

14.

[Then] I would investigate the situation within the company as well as do a site
visit. I would make a decision then on how to proceed based on our findings

15.

[Then] Recommend that you contact your outside accountant to review the
situation with him

16.

[Then] Wonder about other alternatives

17.

[Therefore] Work to understand what the root problem is and if there are
systemic issues

18.

[This is a marvellous opportunity to] Switch to other methods of financing

19.

[This is to] Ensure that our ultimate response/defence of the claim is handled as
professionally as possible

20.

20% of gross profit would likely chew up the company's annual profit

300.

I am sure that no one in the company team wants bad image for the company

153

<-----Page 165----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
and business decline
301.

I ask myself if I want to go that route? Identify my + selling factors, what do I
have to offer

in related staff to assess where we stand on this and on our diversification of
customer based

303.

I have appealed to the professional work ethic and pitched in and helped,
though I don't see the latter as a good ongoing management style except in an

food, not fish" to improve the handling of the raw material

348.

helping us decide whether to consider it seriously

arrange a meeting with your CFO and your account manager at the bank, to let
them know what has happened, and what you will be doing about it.

169

<-----Page 181----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

493.

Hopefully, the manager will be able to react to this with a clear indication of
what the bank will need to carry you past this scenario.

494.

I would use various search criteria

495.

I would be looking for investment money from mortgage brokers, and on line
banks

496.

basic information

520.

If I can't get there, plan a conference call to complete the plan

521.

If I did find something does not make sense, because my chief engineer is one
of the key people in my company, I would not go ahead and play the "blame"
game on people

522.

If I don't believe the business will recover I will look for other opportunities
such as selling or reforming the business structure

523.

If I know the reason for the bad performance, and I believe we have the
potential to overcome it, I will explain to my husband that this is a temporary
situation, and the line of credit will be changed back to normal in xxx months
and the house won't be required as collateral

524.

If I take a stand, I have to be prepared to take the consequences, therefore, I
better inform myself well

525.

If I were the Production Manager or the Sales Manager, I would appeal to the
President to be cautious, and if we were to go ahead, to warn the client of

172

<-----Page 184----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
impending delays
526.

If information not forthcoming from 'intermediary' offer to do NDA

527.

If it involved quoting for a client, I would have taken the estimate with a grain
of salt and quoted a higher amount, based on my own estimates

528.

If key players are not doing their jobs adequately, I may have to take
disciplinary actions to ensure quality is maintained

529.

If no agreement is reached, make decision based on best information

530.

If no consensus, direction must be given

531.

If not getting anywhere, I'd ask to be assigned to the Special Credit desk where
competent staff can monitor my workout

532.

If not probable, say "it is a bit early," and build relationship with intermediary

533.

If probable, enter into NDA

534.

If so, they should be consulted as well to ensure that the Queen's share of any
transactions (income tax) can be minimized

535.

If someone is responsible for not having acted as promised or expected,
consider replacing that individual/individuals with someone who can solve the
problem

536.

If the action plan is not acceptable the next step is to get an assessment of what
it takes to mitigate the damages caused by the defective product

537.

If the client indicates 'you'll be hearing from our lawyers,' that promise [to fix

173

<-----Page 185----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
the problem] will not be necessary
538.

If the company is doing well, I would probably agree to this increase, especially
given the number of labour shortages around

539.

If the company wants to enjoy this current trend, it needs to act fast

540.

If the company were not doing well, I would attempt to continue negotiation to
educate the union representative about why the company could not afford this
increase along with everything else in the collective agreement

541.

If the lease space meets those criteria, make an offer for the space "subject to
shareholder approval" and with a possession date significantly in the future

542.

If the opportunity is aligned with company strategy, make time for the meeting,
if not, decline

543.

If the plans have been on the books for some time, they ought to have some
expression of cost/benefit

544.

If the price is reasonable, I would agree to sell my company. [If the investment
of all employees, including mine, is less than acquiring price with a defined
percentage]

545.

If the product is or will be out of fashion in the next couple of years--Sell

546.

If the product is something that seems to have a bright future -Wait

547.

If the product was used outside of specifications, then we cannot be held liable,
but I would rather avoid going to court, if possible

174

<-----Page 186----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

548.

If the project is large enough, I might ask him to request a review by our outside
financial advisors, likely a public accounting firm

549.

If the workers are on strike the company won't make the forecasted profit for
sure

550.

If they [unions] see a weak CEO, they can bring the company to its knees. From
5% to 7% is a 40% increase in contribution NO WAY

551.

If they are not within our control, we advise the client, and only assign the
resources that will keep profitability in line

552.

If they are within our control, we bring the team together and set out a new
schedule that we are going to meet

553.

If they would not tell me, I would refuse the offer

554.

If this is not possible, document a change in schedule and get approval

555.

If this were important to them, I would attempt to have something else removed
at an equivalent cost saving

556.

If we are a service oriented company then I would have used the rule "the client
is always right"

557.

If you want a quality product, not only do you need quality people, but also you
need quality processes, and employees need a deep understanding

558.

If you want a site make an offer ASAP

559.

In a competitive marketplace, bidding above the 'accepted value' by between 5

175

<-----Page 187----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
& 10% can in fact, lessen the end-to-end acquisition costs because there are
costs in making an offer
560.

In all cases I would play hardball with the bank as they have a lot to lose as well

561.

In all cases the decision is highly volatile depending on the stage of life you're
in, your attachment to the business and your priorities (these will change based
on the person): Jeopardy to life balance, effect on family, and ability to sustain
bankruptcy and start over

562.

In all human interaction there doesn't have to be a winner and a loser

563.

In anticipation, the costs are all 'in the can', so a quick decision is made to move
on the property with a minimum of 'subjects' so that our bid is superior

564.

In for a penny, in for a pound!

565.

In order to ensure the quality of the production, production audit might be used

566.

In order to minimize the cost of this lawsuit, it is important to understand what
is really going on and to learn from the mistake

567.

In the event of financial collapse the financial institutions can come after the
owners personal assets whether they have been chattels to the loan or not

568.

In the software business, there are always different opportunities to be exploited

569.

In this case, $2M revenues with 10 employees seems to me that the company is
doing fairly well and I will probably not sell the business

570.

In this scenario, is it marketing or training?

176

<-----Page 188----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

571.

Increase frequency of measurement and ongoing communication

572.

Increase line of credit for the time being from another source of finance
institution other than banks

573.

Initially decline the offer for engagement in any discussion

574.

576.

Insist on at least 65% of the purchase price being in cash or near-cash

577.

Institute an in house quality system that will resolve issues prior to shipping or
mass production

578.

Interacting with academic institutions is never a bad idea

579.

Investigate as to why the situation has gone from bad to worse

580.

Investigate cause of failure

581.

Is a face-to-face meeting required? Is it required with me personally?
Ultimately, if this is a strategic opportunity for my company, I jump on an
airplane and go meet with the Dean

582.

Is it still the right time? Analyze alternatives, if any

583.

Is the business growing? Am I happy with the Business? Am I the only one this
decision will affect? (i.e. my situation is a family business other people
involved - I could not make this decision on my own)

584.

Is the request reasonable?

177

<-----Page 189----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

585.

Can you afford it?

586.

What is the cost of not granting?

587.

Is there overall benefit to me/them?

588.

Isolate the cause of the problem, and replace the responsible staff if necessary

589.

It does not make sense to put any personal equity into a business. Family and
business are separate domains

590.

It is better if your bank agent learns from you

591.

It is better to be proactive instead to hide from problems

592.

It is better, whenever possible, to not simply override a member of your
management team, but to get them to arrive at the correct answer themselves

593.

It is important to admit your mistakes, especially in the field of business,
because integrity and honesty means everything

594.

It is important to get a commitment from him/her [interested party]

595.

It is not always beneficial to pay too much attention to the details

596.

It is usually just a function of money, time, and a sense of urgency

597.

It sounds, from the problem, that the power is in the company‘s hands and I
would therefore talk to the engineer and ensure that the timeframe that the client
was told included a significant delay so that we would be sure to finish early

598.

It will be very reflective of a purchase price, and depend whether my company
can achieve upside value on its own or in conjunction with the purchaser's

178

<-----Page 190----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING
resources
599.

It would depend upon the offer, the credibility of the "intermediary" and the
potential growth opportunity in the present situation

600.

It's always flattering to be asked [to sell] and at the very least the conversation
could prove educational in its own right

601.

<-----Page 193----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

643.

Money talks, and BS walks

644.

Morale fibre, I have no patience for unions

645.

Moreover, when people make a mistake, it doesn't mean anyone wins because
unless the team can start working toward in the best interest of the company,
everyone loses

646.

Most credit managers at banks are more willing to work with you on credit
problems if you are upfront with them and keep them informed

647.

Most disputes can be negotiated rather than litigated

648.

Most likely would purchase

649.

667.

Obviously it was floor space I had done my homework on, I would make sure
that I was the first offer that was accepted for the space

668.

Offer a one-time 2% signing bonus as our final position. It does not affect long
term costs, and we have done the math on the expected outcome

669.

670.

673.

Once I've explored the avenues to see if all $40K would be written off, I would

Open the books, and negotiate on the basis of actual company financial position

679.

Our product is only as strong as the weakest link

productive, and rewarding work environment
758.

Show good will

759.

Shut the door of the plant, and let the union members sweat out the strike time

760.

Since my suspicion is that the estimates are inaccurate, I will ask my CFO to
have a look at the numbers as well

761.

Since the issue has been "on the book" for some time, I would act immediately

762.

Since you have had ample time to study and verify your needs, you can jump on
it quickly and finalize the deal

763.

Sit down with chief engineer, review and revise estimates

764.

Skilled people coming out of training institution are always beneficial for the
business

765.

Slow your payments to your suppliers to help cash flow

766.

happened, in as professional a manner as possible

Sometime emotionally charged situations can be a levered towards future
success through being authentic with a customer

the key decision makers

The client satisfaction and the image of the company are on first place

795.

The client would need to be careful exactly what he accused my company of,
because he/she would be liable in court for frivolous lawsuits

796.

The client would need to be careful exactly what he accused my company of,
because he/she would be liable in court for frivolous lawsuits

797.

The customer is always right

798.

The first thing I would do is talk to my partner, because if he/she isn't willing to
proceed with raising the money personally then there is no point in me trying to
raise my end of the funds

799.

The more you owe the weaker they [the banks] are

192

<-----Page 204----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

800.

The most important thing here is client expectation

801.

The only people who truly win in a lawsuit are lawyers

802.

The outside accounting firm might, for example have some ideas about how to
present the offer that takes advantage of the vendor's position

803.

The owners are personally liable for the debts of the company even with limited
liability companies. (This is assuming that I am the owner or one of the owners
of this small business )

804.

The price should be less critical than the plan and the probability of effective,
efficient roll-out

805.

The product should perform to the agreed specifications

806.

The sweetness of water depends upon the amount of sugar dissolved. This is
only true to a point after which the additional sugar makes the solution sour

807.

The vessel should be delivered on time or the client will require compensation
and we will lose money on the deal

808.

Then I would state that it is very important for me to address the situation
ASAP, and ask for a face-to-face meeting

809.

There is always a way to borrow money

810.

There is always a way to borrow money

811.

There is always another alternative

812.

This deal cannot be agreed to without an equal concession elsewhere

193

<-----Page 205----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

813.

This is to ensure that our ultimate response/defence of the claim is handled as
professionally as possible

814.

This may require dealing with specific employees who are not producing at the
level required

815.

This may require dealing with specific employees who are not producing at the
level required

816.

This sounds a little complicated, and I want our CFO to review the likely
financial, cash flow and income tax implications

817.

Time between the start and end of the acquisition must be no more than 3
months

818.

Time pressure (whether real or not) gets deals done. Use it whenever you can

819.

To the best of your ability, verify the facts with the real party that you are/will
be dealing with

820.

Try and avoid the lawsuit route as all parties will lose in both the short-term and
in the long-term monetarily, relationship and reputation-wise

822.

Try to achieve a consensus on the renewed goal

823.

Appendix 4: Survey's Raw Data
I present hereunder the raw data from the survey. For quick reference, I repeat every survey
question along with the answers provided by the participants.
The # column identifies the participants by response order. The Yes/No column (q#rad) indicates
if the responder had previous experience with a similar situation. The suggestion column (q#pbd)
lists the participant's problem-solving suggestions, and the last column (q#rad) shows the rules of
thumb the participants provided. The # indicates the scenario number.

Scenario 1: Company Valuation Raw Data
The first business scenario (Company Valuation) asked the following question:
As the CEO of a small software business ($2M in revenues, 10 employees), you have been
approached by an unknown "intermediary" claiming to represent a company interested in
acquiring your business.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above-described scenario, please describe
briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case. Write down the
most probable Rule(s) of Thumb you have applied or you will apply to assist you in your

Scenario 2: Cost Forecast Raw Data
The second business scenario (Cost Forecast) asked the following question:
Your chief engineer has presented to you his cost estimate for a new production workstation to
be implemented within three months. You feel that those estimates are too low and the time frame
too short, once again. You need to decide how to address those issues with your chief engineer,
taking into account that he is one of the key people in your company and that your client expects
results since your company is the only one with the required technology and knowledge to
address their needs.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please describe
briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case:

While people do make a mistake,
it is important to work it out as a

even if you have the clout in the
company.
In addition, when conflict exists,
it is important to figure it out by
looking at the bigger picture.
It is not always beneficial to pay
too much attention to the details.
Moreover, when people make a

Scenario 6: Collective Agreement Raw Data
The sixth business scenario (Collective Agreement) asked the following question:
Your union representative has informed you that the union is ready to go on strike if their last
demand regarding an increase in benefits concerning their RRSP contribution is not met. The
final clause needs to include a 2% increase in company’s contribution to the employee’s RRSP,
i.e. it is going up from the present 5% to 7%. The employee’s contributions remain at 5%. This
means an increase in $200,000 in additional costs to the company or 20% of expected gross
profit, all other things being equal. Furthermore, this is a three-year contract.
Regardless of your previous experience with the above described scenario, please describe
briefly the most probable business decision you would have made in this case:

clients) just lost all value. XYZ declared bankruptcy in Arizona yesterday. Not only have you
invested in that company (not a major amount but enough to show interest in XYZ future since
they choose your company as their main supplier of silicon belts) but also your latest shipment
worth over $40,000 CDN was still not paid. Luckily, you had all your U.S. shipments insured by
Export Development Canada (EDC). However, this will affect your cash flow as well as your

ABSTRACT [by the authors]: This item documents over 170 knowledge management
tools (names of the tools, a short summary, and where you can find extra information),
and is intended to save hours of research time. As a preface to the actual tools listing we
have introduced some of the critical components relating knowledge management and the
nature of the tools that we may have at our disposal to manage knowledge.

Arenas, T. and L. Lavanderos (2008). "Intellectual capital: object or process? ." Journal of
Intellectual Capital 9(1): 77-85.
ABSTRACT [by the authors]: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the epistemological
foundations associated with the concept of IC. Different researchers on intellectual
capital (IC) agree on the issue that at present, knowledge generates sustainable
competitive advantage. However, the distinction between the theoretical perspective and
its practical application is not yet clear. Seemingly, this dissociation may be explained by
the absence of an epistemological analysis related to IC, which accounts for the low
number of pertinent specific publications. This paper analyzes the named epistemological
foundations associated with the concept of IC, from the point of view of the cognitive
sciences, as well as its consequences in the design of methods and indicators of
evaluation. The analysis employed is based on the cognitive groundwork of the
representational and non-representational schools linked to the primeval concepts which

<-----Page 283----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

272

thus far support the definition of IC. The cognitive sciences contribute guidance in the
face of the implications of including IC within the domain of representation and that of
non-representation. The first operates in order to recover external elements and to project
internal ones, making IC unviable as a process, and inevitably reduces it to the account of
objects. In the second case, enactment ends up being incomplete due to the fact that it
maintains the observer-setting duality, which makes it improbable to understand IC as a
network relational process. The results enable the identification of new lines of
development, which clarify and make explicit its epistemological foundations, but which
differ from the prevailing ones.

ABSTRACT: Many kinds of learning are necessary for learning organizations to help
them achieve and sustain a competitive advantage. Continuous learning is critical.
Adaptive and generative thinking are both required. An enterprise that becomes a

Aristotle, T. B. R. W. R. (2007). Rhetoric, eBooks@Adelaide.
ABSTRACT: Aristotle introduces Rhetoric as an art of using language for persuasion.
Rhetoric follows three methods of logos (reason or rational discourse), pathos
(experience or story telling), and ethos (moral competence), as well as the five canons of
memory, invention, delivery, style, and arrangement. Along with grammar and logic or
dialectic, rhetoric is one of the three ancient arts of discourse.

Bernoulli, D. (1738, translated 1954). "Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk."
Econometrica 22: 23-26.
ABSTRACT: In economics, game theory, and decision theory the expected utility
theorem or expected utility hypothesis is a theory of utility in which "betting preferences"
of people with regard to uncertain outcomes (gambles) is represented by a function of the
payout (whether in money or other goods), the probability of occurrence, risk aversion,
and the different utility of the same payout to people with different assets or personal
preferences. This theory has proved useful to explain some popular choices that seem to

<-----Page 285----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

274

contradict the expected value criterion (which takes into account only the size of the
payout and the probability of occurrence), such as gambling and insurance. Daniel
Bernoulli described the complete theory in 1738. John von Neumann and Oskar
Morgenstern reinterpreted and presented an axiomatization of the same theory in 1944.
They proved that any "normal" preference relation over a finite set of states can be
written as an expected utility, sometimes referred to as von Neumann-Morgenstern
utility.

Birnbaum, A. (1977). "The Neyman-Pearson theory as decision theory, and as inference theory;
with a criticism of the Lindely-Savage argument for Bayesian theory." Synthese 36: 19-49.
ABSTRACT [by the author]: The concept of a decision, which is basic in the theories of
Neyman-Pearson, Wald, and Savage, has been judged obscure or inappropriate when
applied to interpretations of data in scientific research, by Fisher, Cox, Tukey, and other
writers. This point is basic for most statistical practice, which is based on applications of
methods derived in the Neyman-Pearson theory or analogous applications of such
methods as least squares and maximum likelihood. Two contrasting interpretations of the
decision concept are formulated: behavioral, applicable to 'decisions' in a concrete literal
sense as in acceptance sampling; and evidential, applicable to 'decisions' such as 'reject
Hi' in a research context, where the pattern and strength of statistical evidence concerning
statistical hypotheses is of central interest. Typical standard practice is characterized as
based on the confidence concept of statistical evidence, which is defined in terms of
evidential interpretations of the 'decisions' of decision theory. These concepts are
illustrated by simple formal examples with interpretations in genetic research, and are

<-----Page 286----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

275

traced in the writings of Neyman, Pearson, and other writers. The Lindley-Savage
argument for Bayesian theory is shown to have no direct cogency as a criticism of typical
standard practice, since it is based on a behavioral, not an evidential, interpretation of
decisions.

ABSTRACT: Father Ong points out the weaknesses and strengths of orality and literacy.
He introduces the concepts of primary oral culture, highly literate culture and secondary
culture - such as the one based on electronic media. In this collection of essays, Father
Ong argues that the Western society has modified its thought process from being based
on oral exchanges to visual ones mainly because of the accelerated development of the
mass media, such as print, radio, and television. In particular, he shows how
technological innovation affect how people communication, not only in the way they
communicate but also in the content of that communication.

ABSTRACT: Bontis discusses how to manage the intellectual capital of corporations. He

of intellectual capital.

Bontis, N. (2001). "Assessing knowledge assets: a review of the models used to measure
intellectual capital." International Journal of Management Reviews 3(a): 41-60.
ABSTRACT [from the author]: This paper reviews the literature pertaining to the
assessment of knowledge assets. Since knowledge assets are at the crux of sustainable
competitive advantage, the burgeoning field of intellectual capital is an exciting area for
both researchers and practitioners. Unfortunately, the measurement of such intangible
assets is difficult. A variety of models have surfaced in an attempt to measure IC and this
paper aims to highlight their strengths, weaknesses and operationalizations.

Braet, A. C. (2005). "The common topic in Aristotle‘s rhetoric: precursor of the argumentation
scheme." Argumentation 19: 65-83.
ABSTRACT [by the author]: In the present article I attribute to the common topic in the
Rhetoric a twofold suggestive function and a guarantee function. These three functions
are possible because this type of topic, while often quite abstract, nevertheless contains
thought steering, substantial terms, and formulates a generally empirical or normative
endoxon [accepted opinion]. Assuming that according to Aristotle an enthymeme has at
least two premises, it would appear that a common topic is the abstract principle behind
the often implicit major premise. This means that the topic may be regarded as the –

<-----Page 288----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

277

generalizing – if-then statement in a modern argumentation scheme. Therefore it should
be possible to see the enthymemes of Rhetoric 2.23 as a combination of a logical
argument form (which can usually be reconstructed as modus ponens) and an
argumentation scheme – even though we may not attribute this idea to Aristotle himself.

capability." Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing 18(1): 6-21.
ABSTRACT [by the authors]: This study surveys a broad spectrum of US manufacturer
and service firms to examine the effect of tacit knowledge transfer on firm innovation
capability. The authors present a set of hypotheses concerning the relationships between
inter-firm relationship strength and tacitness of knowledge transfer, extent of tacit
knowledge transfer and innovation capability, and innovation capability and innovation
performance based on the theory of knowledge. Moderating roles of firm collaborative
experience and firm size on the relationship between inter-firm relations strength and the
extent of tacit knowledge transfer are considered. Empirical results generally support the
predictions from the theory and managerial implications are included.

Chatzkel, J. (2004). "Greater Phoenix as a knowledge capital." Journal of Knowledge
Management 8(5): 61-72.
ABSTRACT [by the author]: This paper aims to provide a strategic perspective for
professionals and practitioners to better understand necessary elements for building a
successful knowledge capital and to demonstrate how holding conversations with key
leadership evokes viewpoints and relevant information to take into account. The paper
maps out a strategic perspective of the major elements of a knowledge capital and then
integrates a series of conversational interviews with regional leaders who have
backgrounds in policy, journalism, and technology. The conceptual scope of the paper
dealt with mapping out essential principals and practices for the creation of knowledge
capitals in general. The particular focus of the paper was on the Greater Phoenix region
and the specific efforts underway there to transition into becoming a knowledge capital.
The results are an integrated approach delineating the necessary perspective for
developing a knowledge capital and a set of views from significant leadership of a region
on what its problems are in becoming a knowledge capital.

Cocchiarella, N. B. (2001). "Logic and ontology." Axiomathes 12: 117-150.
ABSTRACT: A brief review of the historical relation between logic and ontology and of
the opposition between the views of logic as language and logic as calculus is given. We
argue that predication is more fundamental than membership and that different theories of
predication are based on different theories of universals, the three most important being
nominalism, conceptualism, and realism. These theories can be formulated as formal
ontologies, each with its own logic, and compared with one another in terms of their
respective explanatory powers. After a brief survey of such a comparison, we argue that
an extended form of conceptual realism provides the most coherent formal ontology and,
as such, can be used to defend the view of logic as language.

Coleman, L. (2006). "Why managers and companies take risks."
ABSTRACT: This book uses risk in its dictionary meaning as the probability of an
undesirable outcome. It addresses two research questions: when managers make
decisions, what leads them to choose a risky alternative? and: what determines whether
the decision proves correct? Answers to these questions form a model of decision making
that explains the process and results of managers' risk-taking in the real world.

familiar approaches don't work. For one thing, with a wicked problem there isn't even
agreement about what the problem is, much less how to solve it. To make progress one
must focus on creating maximum shared understanding and shared commitment among
the stakeholders. Dialogue mapping is a proven technique for building that shared
understanding and commitment, as efficiently and effectively as possible.

Field Settings. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company.
ABSTRACT: This book presents a discussion of the positivist origins of science and
evaluation research. It details a range of quasi-experimental approaches suitable to
research, together with respective statistical techniques. The book includes a realistic
assessment of randomization barriers and includes the observation that true
randomization is rarely used unless there is a substantive power differential

ABSTRACT: The authors present the three vital components of classical rhetoric-argument, arrangement, and style. Presenting its subject in five parts, the text consists of
the elements and applications of classical rhetoric; the strategies and tactics of
argumentation; the effective presentation and organization of discourses; the
development of power, grace, and felicity in expression; and the history of rhetorical
principles.

Corbin, J. and A. Strauss (1990). "Grounded Theory Research: Procedures, Canons, and
Evaluative Criteria." Qualitative Sociology 13(1).
ABSTRACT: Using grounded theory as an example, this paper examines three
methodological questions that are generally applicable to all qualitative methods. How
should the usual scientific canons be reinterpreted for qualitative research? How should
researchers report the procedures and canons used in their research? What evaluative
criteria should be used in judging the research products? We propose that the criteria
should be adapted to fit the procedures of the method. We demonstrate how this can be
done for grounded theory and suggest criteria for evaluating studies following this
approach. We argue that other qualitative researchers might be similarly specific about
their procedures and evaluative criteria.

Davenport, T. H. and L. Prusak (1998). Working knowledge, (How organizations manage what
they know).
ABSTRACT: Knowledge management is a hot topic, but it is usually pushed by people
who want to sell something. As a result, you can end up with a lot of technology that will
not help you to manage your knowledge. As insurance against getting started in the
wrong direction, I suggest you read Working Knowledge as a first step. Davenport and
Prusak have examined 39 organizations that are well above average users of their
knowledge. The case histories will give you a practical sense of what works that would
take you years of false steps to duplicate in your organization. Then, even more helpfully,
the authors outline the key lessons of these top performers for you to follow. I especially

recommend chapter 9 on The Pragmatics of Knowledge Management. Any new initiative
will run into problems and fall back. A great book to read next is The Dance of Change,
which focuses squarely on that issue. Any book has to narrow its focus to be successful.
That focus creates a vulnerability. In this book, the vulnerability is not looking far enough
ahead for more effective ways to do knowledge management that no one is yet doing. For
example, the potential to share knowledge among top best practice organizations is
enormous.

Dempsey, M. (1999). "Global diversity makes his role vital." Financial Time UK: 2.
ABSTRACT [by the author]: Uniqema is the specialty chemicals arm of the Imperial
Chemical Industries empire. With a minimal headquarters presence in central London and
$1bn turnover, Uniqema sells to more than 90 countries with such customers as Roche,
the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, and Colgate-Palmolive, the US toiletries
and personal products company. Richard Miller joined the Uniqema board with a
background in industrial chemicals research in 1993. Today, the expert in soap
technology is working as a chief knowledge officer. Mr Miller does not think of
knowledge management as a new concept. "The apprentice system of the medieval guilds
was a masterpiece of KM but it could only happen on a one-to-one basis," he says. Mr
Miller has noticed that KM tends to be implemented from one of two directions. "Either
people come at it from a human resources direction and say it's all about culture, or they
believe it is all about IT and using Lotus Notes and databases." He thinks both these
approaches are flawed.

Diefenbach, T. (2006). "Intangible resources: a categorial system of knowledge and other
intangible assets." Journal of Intellectual Capital. 7(3): 406-420.
[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]: Purpose - There are several strands that cope with
particular intangible resources, such as intangible assets, intellectual, human, and
organisational capital, data and information, knowledge and capabilities. However, until
now there have been no attempts to define and identify all intangible resources
systematically in one framework. The purpose of this paper is to show how an exhaustive
and exclusive categorial system of all intangible resources can be generated.
Design/methodology/approach - Following the idea of comparative analyses by grounded
theory, it will be referred to relevant approaches which can be defined in academic
literature. It is investigated how types of intangible resources, that share common
attributes, can be grouped together, which categories emerge, and how these categories
can be defined. This gradually leads to the creation of the whole categorial system based
on empirical inductionism. At the same time, the categorial system is created based on
logical deductionism. Having defined intangible resources as the objects of reasoning and
by which leading principles will be looked at, the class of intangible resources will be
broken down into categories or sub-classes with the help of precisely formulated
attributes. Findings - Generation of a comprehensive, consistent, and complete categorial
system of all possible types of intangible assets. Research limitations/implications Solely a theoretical paper. Although empirical examples are provided it might be
interesting to demonstrate the application of this categorial system. Practical implications
- With such a categorial system we are in the position to identify and locate the
uncountable number of "real world" types of intangible resources more precisely and

<-----Page 295----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

284

efficiently. Originality/value - With such an attempt it may become clearer how to cope
with different types of intangible resources, how to gather, create, use, share and develop
them more appropriately.

Drucker, P., F. (1999). Management Challenges for the 21st Century.
ABSTRACT: Drucker reviews the seven major assumptions that have been held by
experts in the field of management for most of the 20th century, and shows why they are
now obsolete. He goes on to give eight new assumptions for the 21st century, ones that
are essential for viewing the roles of individuals and management in both profit and notfor-profit organizations. Neither individuals nor organizations can be successful if they
stick with the old assumptions, according to Drucker, just as the horse and carriage can
no longer compete with the automobile. If Drucker is right, then this has major
implications for individuals, organizations, and management consultants who would use
process models, personality type theory, and ideas of human consciousness to improve
individual, team, and organizational performance. Personality type theories such as the
MBTI® or Enneagram Personality Types similarly describe typical patterns of
consciousness that result from strongly held preferences in individuals - fixed habitual
mind-sets. And organizations themselves can be described in terms of Type theory.
Commenting from the point of view of psychology and personality theory, we
demonstrate in our review of the six chapter of Drucker's new book how the analysis of
one of this century's leading management thinkers is consistent with a model of
information-sharing that values 'whole type'. [From a book review by Walter J. Geldart]

Duncker, K. (1945). "On problem solving." Psychological monographs 58: 1-113.
ABSTRACT: Duncker was the first person to propose the notion of functional
fixity/fixedness in problem solving (i.e., the inability to find the solution to a new
problem because one attempts to use old methods that are not suitable in the new
situation). Similarly, set effects refer to solvers‘ tendency to get stuck in a ‗mental rut‘
where a familiar problem-solving approach continues to be applied even when it is no
longer appropriate . (Credo Reference) [Not available online]

Endres, M. L., S. P. Endres, et al. (2007). "Tacit knowledge sharing, self-efficacy theory, and
application to the Open Source community." Journal of knowledge management 11(2): 92-103.
ABSTRACT [by the authors]: The purpose of this paper is to apply the self-efficacy
model to compare knowledge-sharing activities in the Open Source community versus
those in a traditional organization. Current literature on tacit knowledge sharing and
information about the Open Source community is synthesized in the study with research
concerning self-efficacy formation. The knowledge-sharing literature is applied in the
paper to the self-efficacy model. Through a synthesis of different streams of literature,
the paper concludes that the self-efficacy model serves as a useful framework for better
understanding the effects of context on tacit knowledge sharing. Furthermore, it is
concluded that the Open Source community may provide an ideal set of subjects to whom
the model can be applied. Only propositions are offered, and the conclusions are
suggestions for future research. The self-efficacy model has been successfully applied to
other areas of research in early stages (e.g. entrepreneurship) and provides a valid,
tangible framework that allows many research possibilities. This paper takes a highly

<-----Page 297----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

286

valid and respected model and applies it to individual tacit knowledge sharing, a field in
which little cross-discipline work is done. This paper bridges a central organizational
behavior/psychological theory with knowledge management research.

ABSTRACT: Gigerenzer draws on his own research as well as that of other
psychologists to show how even experts rely on intuition to shape their judgment, going
so far as to ignore available data in order to make snap decisions. Sometimes, the solution
to a complex problem can be boiled down to one easily recognized factor, he says, and
the author uses case studies to show that the Take the Best approach often works.

Gigerenzer, G. (2008). "Why heuristics work." Perspectives on Psychological Science 3(11): 2029.
ABSTRACT [by the author] The adaptive toolbox is a Darwinian-inspired theory that
conceives of the mind as a modular system that is composed of heuristics, their building
blocks, and evolved capacities. The study of the adaptive toolbox is descriptive and
analyzes the selection and structure of heuristics in social and physical environments. The
study of ecological rationality is prescriptive and identifies the structure of environments
in which specific heuristics either succeed or fail. Results have been used for designing
heuristics and environments to improve professional decision making in the real world.

cognition: reply to Dougherty, Franco-Watkins, and Thomas (2008)." Psychological Review
115(1): 230–239.
ABSTRACT [by the authors] M. R. Dougherty, A. M. Franco-Watkins, and R. Thomas
(2008) conjectured that fast and frugal heuristics need an automatic frequency counter for
ordering cues. In fact, only a few heuristics order cues, and these orderings can arise from
evolutionary, social, or individual learning, none of which requires automatic frequency
counting. The idea that cue validities cannot be computed because memory does not
encode missing information is misinformed; it implies that measures of co-occurrence are
incomputable and would invalidate most theories of cue learning. They also questioned
the recognition heuristic‘s psychological plausibility on the basis of their belief that it has
not been implemented in a memory model, although it actually has been implemented in
ACT-R (L. J. Schooler & R. Hertwig, 2005). On the positive side, M. R. Dougherty et al.
discovered a new mechanism for a less-is-more effect. The authors of the present article
specify minimal criteria for psychological plausibility, describe some genuine challenges
in the study of heuristics, and conclude that fast and frugal heuristics are psychologically
plausible: They use limited search and are tractable and robust.

BASES OF NATURALISTIC INQUIRY. Evaluation models, Kluwer Academic Publication.
Chapter 19: 19.
ABSTRACT: Naturalistic inquiry is a paradigm of inquiry; that is, a pattern or model for
how inquiry may be conducted. While it is frequently asserted that its distinguishing

<-----Page 300----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

289

features are: that it is carried out in a natural setting (and hence the term naturalistic), that
it utilizes a case-study format, and that it relies heavily on qualitative rather than
quantitative methods, none of these features define naturalistic inquiry. While all of these
assertions are essentially correct, no one of them, nor indeed all of them together, capture
the full significance of the term paradigm. Paradigms differ from one another on matters
much more fundamental than the locale in which the inquiry is conducted, the format of
the inquiry report, or the nature of the methods used. Paradigms are axiomatic systems
characterized by their differing sets of assumptions about the phenomena into which they
are designed to inquire.

Haldin-Herrgard, T. (2000). "Difficulties in diffusion of tacit knowledge in organizations."
Journal of Intellectual Capital 1(4): 357-365.
ABSTRACT: Knowledge management implies a coding capability. Internal individual
processes like experience and talent results in tacit knowledge that is difficult to code,
therefore it cannot be managed and shared as explicit knowledge. Conversion of tacit
knowledge to explicit or at least ability to share it offers great value to an organization.

ABSTRACT: The objective of the paper is to describe how tacit knowledge in particular,
is acquired, shared and retained in small firms. Implied is the notion is that knowledge
management is leveraged by organizations as a strategy to turn an organization‘s
intellectual assets into greater productivity, new value and increased competitiveness.

Harlow, H. (2008). "The effect of tacit knowledge on firm performance." Journal of knowledge
management 12(1): 148-163.
ABSTRACT: Purpose –(TKI) to assess the level of tacit knowledge within firms and its
effect on firm performance. A sample of 108 US and Canadian firms that are using
knowledge management was surveyed to determine each firm‘s TKI. This measure
includes both the degree of usage and the tacitness of the knowledge management
method. Regression and correlation were used to statistically analyze the innovation and
financial outcomes. Significant relationships were found between a firm‘s level of TKI
and the firm‘s innovation performance. Less clear is the relationship between a higher
TKI and financial measures. This research gives managers a way to structure their use of
knowledge management methodology and use of resources in a way that may maximize
performance, either as standalone systems or as part of the Balanced Scorecard. The use
of this research could greatly reduce the uncomfortable gut feeling that many managers
have in funding so-called soft tacit-based knowledge management systems rather than
invest in easier to assess hardware systems. This pioneering research develops tacit
knowledge as a measurable quantity and links this metric to firm performance.

exchange protocols." Journal of knowledge management 5(1): 9.
ABSTRACT: In the knowledge management domain, the conversion of tacit knowledge
to explicit knowledge is critical because it is a prerequisite to the knowledge
amplification process wherein knowledge becomes part of an organization‘s knowledge
network. In this article, knowledge exchange protocols are examined as a vehicle for

<-----Page 302----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

291

improving the tacit to explicit knowledge conversion process. In an experiment testing
the use of knowledge exchange protocols, it is learned that while structure may
significantly improve the tacit to explicit knowledge conversion process, it also may
matter how the structure is employed in this process.

ABSTRACT: This article focuses on the usefulness of heuristic models in business
planning. The use of computer algorithms and stochastic processes are appropriate for
certain sophisticated business models. However, such advance modeling can use
resources such as time and money that may not be practical. The use of heuristic models
allows many companies to approach decision-making based on less information.
Heuristic models have been used to develop delivery schedules, airline schedules, certain
aspects of marketing, and problems associated with warehouse storage.

ABSTRACT: The article presents on general purpose knowledge management (KM)

<-----Page 303----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

292

ontology, that can be used by practitioners, researchers and educators. Ontologies are
useful because they explicate components that define a phenomenon and, thus, can help
in systematically understanding or modeling that phenomenon. The ontology is
characterized in terms of formal definitions and axioms that have evolved from a
collaborative ontology design process. The ontology identifies and relates knowledge
manipulation activities that an entity can perform to operate on knowledge resources. It
introduces a taxonomy for these resources, which indicates classes of knowledge that
may be stored, embedded, and represented in an entity. It recognizes factors that
influence the conduct of KM both within and across KM episodes. The ontology is
intended to stimulate further conceptual development in the KM field. The ontology can
further evolve through added breadth and depth. It can be extended in a normative
direction by adding elements that prescribe methods and technologies for the conduct of
KM. Future research and practice will more fully determine the extent of this ontology's
utility and applicability

knowledge management." Journal of Knowledge Management; 9(4): 12.
ABSTRACT (adapted): The authors explore the relationship between knowledge
management (KM) and communities of practice (CoPs) in general and virtual CoPs in
particular, using theoretical constructs, the notion of a duality, and data from a case study.
The case study of a virtual CoP was based in three geographically separate locations (the
UK, the USA, and Japan). The case study covers the activities of the UK part of the CoP
both at their UK base and during one of their regular trips to the USA. It highlights the
importance of two particular aspects of virtual working: social relationships and the use
of shared artifacts. The main contribution of this paper is in making an explicit link
between KM and CoPs through the use of the notion of the duality of knowledge.

(includes related article)(Teaching Smart Companies to Learn: Organizational Learning
Revisited)." Organizational Dynamics 27(2): 43.
ABSTRACT (by the authors): A learning history is one of the most deliberate and
effective ways of institutionalizing reflection in entire organizations. This history is a
document that relates the organization's own story in an engaging manner to encourage
reflective conversations that collect and spread learning throughout the organization. It
does not propose any solutions as to how the organization can move forward, but instead
seeks to provide a common context that promotes the development of a shared
understanding among readers and enable them to come up with their own solutions. The
three imperatives in the creation of an organizational history are staying 'true to the data'
so that the history can be validated, staying 'true to the story' so that it gains people's

<-----Page 305----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

294

attention and staying 'true to the audience' so that the way it is presented helps propel the
organization forward.

ABSTRACT: This article provides an empirical review and synthesis of published
studies that have used content-analysis methods, Harold Kassarjian's critical guidelines
for content-analysis research were used to examine the methods employed in 128 studies.
The guidelines were expanded by providing an empirical investigation of multiple
dimensions of objectivity. Reliability issues were also assessed by examining factors
central to the replication and interjudge coefficient calculations. The findings indicate a
general need for improvement in the application of content-analysis methods.
Suggestions for calculating reliability coefficients and for improving the objectivity and
reliability of research are offered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

ABSTRACT: When economics is normative—meaning that the objective is to make a
policy recommendation—the evaluative criteria is economic efficiency. The basic idea is
that scarce resources should be allocated to their most valued uses. Cost-benefit analysis
(CBA) is the primary tool that economists employ to determine whether a particular
policy, or policy proposal, promotes economic efficiency. At the most general and

<-----Page 306----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

295

comprehensive level, CBA is an aggregator of all impacts, to all affected parties, at all
points in time. The impacts, both positive and negative, are converted into a common
monetary unit, and the cost-benefit criteria is simply a test of whether the benefits exceed
the costs. If the net benefits are positive, the policy promotes economic efficiency.

Why. The Content Analysis Reader, Krippendorff, K. & Bock, M, A.: 8.
ABSTRACT [by the author]: In the most general terms, reliability is the extent to which
data can be trusted to represent genuine rather than spurious phenomena. Sources of
unreliability are many. Measuring instruments may malfunction, be influenced by
irrelevant circumstances of their use, or be misread. Content analysts may disagree on the
readings of a text. Coding instructions may not be clear. The definitions of categories
may be ambiguous or do not seem applicable to what they are supposed to describe.
Coders may get tired, become inattentive to important details, or are diversely prejudiced.
Unreliable data can lead to wrong research results.

Landis, R. J. and G. G. Koch (1977). "An application of Hierarchical Kappa-type Statistics in the
Assessment of Majority Agreement among Multiple Observers." Biometrics 33(2): 363-374.
ABSTRACT [by authors]: This paper presents a general statistical methodology for the
analysis of multivariate categorical data involving agreement among more than two
observers. Since these situations give rise to very large contingency tables in which most
of the observed cell frequencies are zero, procedures based on indicator variables of the
raw data for individual subjects are used to generate first-order margins and main

<-----Page 307----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

296

diagonal sums from the conceptual multidimensional contingency table. From these
quantities, estimates are generated to reflect the strength of an internal majority decision
on each subject. Moreover, a subset of observers who demonstrate a high level of
interobserver agreement can be identified by using pairwise agreement statistics between
each observer and the internal majority standard opinion on each subject. These
procedures are all illustrated within the context of a clinical diagnosis example involving
seven pathologists.

trust in effective knowledge transfer." Management Science 50(11): 1477-1490.
ABSTRACT [by the authors] Research has demonstrated that relationships are critical to
knowledge creation and transfer, yet findings have been mixed regarding the importance
of relational and structural characteristics of social capital for the receipt of tacit and
explicit knowledge. We propose and test a model of two-party (dyadic) knowledge
exchange, with strong support in each of the three companies surveyed. First, the link
between strong ties and receipt of useful knowledge (as reported by the knowledge
seeker) was mediated by competence- and benevolence-based trust. Second, once we
controlled for these two trustworthiness dimensions, the structural benefit of weak ties
emerged. This finding is consistent with prior research suggesting that weak ties provide
access to non-redundant information. Third, competence-based trust was especially
important for the receipt of tacit knowledge. We discuss implications for theory and
practice.

Education 18(2): 12.
ABSTRACT [by the authors]: Transfer of learning is at the heart of social work training
yet there has been very little exploration of what transfer of learning is and how it might
be facilitated. From the perspective of literature review covering the fields of education,
psychology, social work and nursing studies we examine the concept and process of
transfer of learning. From a basic definition of 'prior learning affecting new learning or
performance', we look at transfer of learning from the point of view of the learner,
discussing the concept of the active learner striving to make connections between
previous knowledge and new input. We look at cognitive models of learning which
illuminate the transfer task-schema theory - the idea that knowledge is retained in the
mind in terms of representations which are continually reconstructed according to new
experience; and information processing theory which describes the active processes of
generalization and abstraction through which such representations are reconstructed. We
look at the importance of mindfulness, reflection and metacognitive awareness in the
these processes. In conclusion we indicate ways in which transfer of learning may be
facilitated in social work education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

ABSTRACT: Culture is often seen as the key inhibitor of effective knowledge sharing. A
study of companies where sharing knowledge is built into the culture found that they did
not change their culture to match their knowledge management initiatives. They adapted
their approach to knowledge management to fit their culture. They did this by: linking
sharing knowledge to solving practical business problems; tying sharing knowledge to a
pre-existing core value; introducing knowledge management in a way that matches the

organization‘s style; building on existing networks people use in their daily work; and
encouraging peers and supervisors to exert pressure to share.

McDonald, C. J. (1996). "Medical heuristics: the silent adjudicators of clinical practice."
American College of Physicians 124(1): 56-62.
ABSTRACT: Robust scientific conclusions are too sparse to inform fully most of the
choices that physicians must make about tests and treatments. Instead, ad hoc rules of
thumb, or ―heuristics,‖ must guide them, and many of these are problematic. Physicians
extrapolate from the small samples studied by clinical trials to general populations, but
they do so inconsistently. Many physicians live by rules that dictate ―not treating the
numbers,‖ correcting abnormalities slowly, achieving diagnostic certainty, and operating
now to avoid ―greater‖ risk in the future. Yet in each case, historical trends or statistical
realities suggest either doing the opposite or investing in more discriminating heuristics.
The heuristics of medicine should be discussed, criticized, refined, and then taught. More
uniform use of explicit and better heuristics could lead to less practice variation and more
efficient medical care.

Mintz, A. (2004). "How Do Leaders Make Decisions?: a poliheuristic perspective." The Journal
of Conflict Resolution 48(1): 3-14.
ABSTRACT: Poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between cognitive and rational
theories of decision making. PH postulates a two-stage decision process. During the first
stage, the set of possible options is reduced by applying a non-compensatory principle to
eliminate any alternative with an unacceptable return on a critical, typically political,
decision dimension once the choice set has been reduced to alternatives that are
acceptable to the decision maker, the process moves to a second stage, during which the
decision maker uses more analytic processing in an attempt to minimize risks and
maximize benefits. In this article, the author applies poliheuristic theory to individual,

In his farewell address to the American people given in January 1953, President Truman
referred to this concept very specifically in asserting that, "The President--whoever he is-has to decide. He cannot pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for
him. That is his job.

Newman, V. (2006). "Leadership and strategic knowledge management." Knowledge
Management Review 9(4): 4.
ABSTRACT: The problem for organizations is that reality keeps changing. This article
explains the concept, processes and needs for strategic knowledge management (SKM),

<-----Page 312----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

301

which is about working within this continuously evolving reality and harnessing the
newest knowledge in the organization to continuously update strategies and business
plans. SKM is the deliberate selection and manipulation of different forms of knowledge
to create and implement successful and innovative strategies. The CEO's key role is to be
a masterful facilitator who can guide the organization through a continuous process of
strategic conversations that refocus the strategy on knowledge that is both current and
emergent. A leader managing a strategic conversation that constructs the rationale behind
the organization's SKM needs to understand and work across at least four types of
complementary innovating behaviors. These are: 1. creators, 2. implementors, 3.
stabilizors, and 4. navigators. SKM involves maintaining awareness of choices and
assumptions that can be manipulated to drive discontinuity.

ABSTRACT: According to the authors, "the success of Japanese companies is not due to
their manufacturing process; access to cheap capital; close and cooperative relationships
with customers, suppliers, and government agencies; or lifetime employment, seniority

knowledge and best practice. New York, NY, The Free Press.
ABSTRACT: The authors assert that "there is no conclusion to managing knowledge and
transferring best practices. It is a race without a finishing line." They are right, now and
especially in years to come. In the concluding chapter, the authors share ten "Enduring
Principles" which should inform and direct the formulation of any plan by which to
manage knowledge and transfer best practices. During implementation of the plan,
everyone involved must be willing and able to make whatever adjustments may be
necessary.

ABSTRACT: Ong's book is a mix of small studies – one on Tudor rhetoric, another on
primary vs. secondary orality, another on the pedagogy of Peter Ramus and his followers,
a nice essay on Swift, quite a few on poetry, one is on orality, and the last on a ‗crisis in
the humanities‘ but they are all linked together.

ABSTRACT: The presumably main goal of any empirical investigation is to reveal the
association structure among the variables of concern and to interpret the associations in
terms of causality. The latter, however, has been subject to numerous controversial
debates, since there was and still is great doubt about the legitimacy of drawing causal
conclusions from empirical results only.

ABSTRACT [by the author]: A recent conference in London addressed the issue of
‗Measuring Knowledge Value‘. A series of presentations contributed to the ongoing
debate on how the benefits of Knowledge Management can be evaluated and measured.
In the current business climate, there is a growing need to spell out the concrete impact of
knowledge projects on business performance. The conference showed once again that
this is easier said than done.

ABSTRACT [by authors]: In content analysis studies texts might be coded three times or
more, certainly in the training part. With respect to reliability several views on agreement
can be used now, as these are found in the literature. These views are presented, and this
is followed by a discussion resulting in the opinion that in research only one view, that of
mean pairwise agreement, should be used.

ABSTRACT [by authors]: In recent years the expected utility model of choice under risk
has been generalized to cope with phenomena such as probability weighting. In the
present paper, one such generalized approach, the rank-dependent expected utility model,
is applied to the problem of lottery gambling. The model is used to derive an optimal
prize structure for lotteries, involving a few large prizes and a large number of small
prizes. Other forms of gambling, such as racetrack betting, are discussed in the light of

argument. AAAI-94 Proceedings.
ABSTRACT [by authors]: This research explores the appropriateness of the search
paradigm as a framework for harvesting and mining information needed to make legal
arguments. We discuss how we tackled the problem of evaluation of BankXX from both
the case-based reasoning (CBR) and task-performance perspectives. In particular, we
discuss how various system parameters- start node, evaluation function, resource limitaffected BankXX from the CBR perspective and how well BankXX performs its assigned
task of gathering information useful for legal argumentation by running BankXX on real
legal cases and comparing its output with the published court opinions for those cases.

Sebestik, J. (2007). Bolzano's logic. Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.
ABSTRACT: Bolzano's presentation of logic is embedded in the vast body of the Theory
of Science (henceforth TS). His logic is based on the abstract concepts of proposition in
itself (an such) and idea in itself, which are both independent of thought and language.
His logic of ideas contains a new treatment of their content and extension and, among
other things, yields an analysis of ideas without objects. A purely logical definition of
intuitions as simple singular ideas allowed Bolzano to distinguish them from concepts
and to complete the traditional epistemological distinction between a priori and a
posteriori by the logical distinction between conceptual and empirical propositions (and
sciences). The main innovations of Bolzano's logic consist in the definitions of validity,

<-----Page 317----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

306

analyticity and logical truth and the creation of a complete system of extensional relations
between propositions, the most important of these being compatibility, deducibility (=
consequence), and equivalence. Bolzano discovered the link between deducibility and
conditional probability, according to which deducibility and incompatibility appear as
two limit cases of conditional probability (this idea was taken over or reinvented by
Wittgenstein in the Tractatus). Deductive logic is thus extended to inductive logic based
on probability. Bolzano's theory of the grounding relation leading to the hierarchical
order of theorems is the first modern study of axiomatic systems. Moreover, the thorough
discussions of concepts of logic and many other insights contribute to make the TS one of
the classical works in logic and epistemology, on a par with those of Aristotle, Leibniz,
and Frege. The extensive historical notes contained in it are a unique source for the
history of logic. Although written in natural language, Bolzano's logic represents a
decisive breakthrough in the development of modern logic.

Sim, J. and C. C. Wright (2005). "The Kappa Statistic in Reliability Studies: Use, Interpretation,
and Sample Size Requirements." Physical Therapy 85(3): 257-268.
ABSTRACT [by the authors]: This article examines and illustrates the use and
interpretation of the kappa statistic in musculoskeletal research. The reliability of
clinicians' ratings is an important consideration in areas such as diagnosis and the
interpretation of examination findings. Often, these ratings lie on a nominal or an ordinal
scale. For such data, the kappa coefficient is an appropriate measure of reliability. Kappa
is defined, in both weighted and un-weighted forms, and its use is illustrated with
examples from musculoskeletal research. Factors that can influence the magnitude of

<-----Page 318----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

307

kappa (prevalence, bias, and non-independent ratings) are discussed, and ways of
evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered. The issue of statistical
testing of kappa is considered, including the use of confidence intervals, and appropriate
sample sizes for reliability studies using kappa are tabulated. The article concludes with
recommendations for the use and interpretation of kappa.

Simon, H. A. (1990). "Invariants of human behavior." Annual Review of Psychology 41: 1-19.
ABSTRACT: One of the most important laws of qualitative structure applying to
physical symbol systems, computers and the human brain include: Because of the limits
on their computing speeds and power, intelligent systems must use approximate methods
to handle most tasks. Their rationality is bounded. Historically, human adaptiveness (that
is to say, rationality) has preoccupied economists even more than psychologists. Modem
mainstream economic theory bravely assumes that people make their decisions in such a
way as to maximize their utility. Accepting this assumption enables economics to predict
a great deal of behavior (correctly or incorrectly) without ever making empirical studies
of human actors.

Slonim, L. R. (1998). "Learning rules of thumb or learning more rational rules." Journal of
Economic Behavior & Organization 38: 217-236.
ABSTRACT [by the author]: This paper reports on an experiment that distinguishes
between learning rules that produce substantively rational behavior in more situations and
learning simple rules that do not. The experimental task is a simplification of many
naturally occurring search problems. The experiment manipulates individual choice

<-----Page 319----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

308

problems such that simple rules produce substantively rational behavior in one condition
but not in subsequent ones. Choice data indicate subjects may learn to use more rational
rules since subjects successfully transfer what they learn in one condition to another.
However, verbal protocols indicate subjects learn to selectively use simple rules in order
to make more substantively rational choices.

Sriram , N. and A. Greenwald (2009). "The brief implicit association test." Experimental
Psychology 56(4): 283-294.
ABSTRACT [by the authors]: The Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) consists of
two blocks of trials with the same four categories and stimulus-response mappings as the
standard IAT, but with 1/3 the number of trials. Unlike the standard IAT, the BIAT
focuses the subject on just two of each block‘s four categories. Experiments 1 and 2
demonstrated that attitude BIATs had satisfactory validity when good (but not bad) was a
focal category, and that identity IATs had satisfactory validity when self (but not other)
was a focal category. Experiment 2 also showed that a good-focal attitude BIAT and a
self-focal identity BIAT were psychometrically similar to standard IAT measures of the
same constructs. Experiment 3 presented each of six BIATs twice, showing that

<-----Page 320----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

309

procedural variables had no more than minor influences on the resulting implicit
measures. Experiment 4 further demonstrated successful use of the BIAT to measure
implicit stereotypes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)

ABSTRACT: The valuation of knowledge capital makes it possible to assess the worth of
the people who possess the accumulated knowledge about an organization. They are the
individuals who leave the workplace every night (and may never return), storing in their
heads the know-how acquired while receiving full pay. Their brains are repositories of
knowledge accumulated over untold hours of listening and talking while not delivering
any goods or services to paying customers.

Simultaneous and Sequential Choice." Journal of Bioeconomics 3: 195-2001.
ABSTRACT (by the author): When a choice must be made between simultaneouslyavailable options, minimal information in the form of binary recognition (whether or not
each time is recognized) can be used in the recognition heuristic to choose effectively.
When options are encountered sequentially one at a time, minimal information as to
whether or not each option is the best encountered so far is sufficient to guide agents
using a simple search-cutoff rule to high performance along several choice criteria.

ABSTRACT: Discussion on modernity and post-modernity. Toulmin shows us just how
far the the academic/social community will sacrifice truth and knowledge for certainty
when social climates dictate it. Understanding this dynamic allows us to realize that times
of crisis need not be resolved by a Quest for Certainty which operates on principles of
timeless truths or single domain methods. As Toulmin constantly advises us, there are no

Trochim, M. K. W. (1993). The Reliability of Concept Mapping. Annual Conference of the
American Evaluation Association. Dallas, Texas: 16.
ABSTRACT [by author]: Because of the growing interest in and use of the concept
mapping methodology, it is important to define rigorous and feasible standards of quality.
This paper addresses the issue of the reliability of concept mapping. Six different
reliability coefficients that can easily be estimated from the data typically available from
any concept mapping project were defined and estimated for 38 different concept
mapping projects. Results indicate that the concept mapping process can be considered
reliable according to generally-recognized standards for acceptable reliability levels. It is
recommended that the reliabilities estimated here be routinely reported with concept
mapping project results.

ABSTRACT [by the author]: There is wide disagreement about the usefulness of kappa
statistics to assess rater agreement. At the least, it can be said that (1) kappa statistics
should not be viewed as the unequivocal standard or default way to quantify agreement;
(2) one should be concerned about using a statistic that is the source of so much
controversy; and (3) one should consider alternatives and make an informed choice.

ABSTRACT [by author]: The author presents several organization management tips.
The objective of organization is to set up relationships and procedures in which
employees can obtain the best results from their combined efforts. Organizing consists of
analyzing, identifying and defining the work to meet the company's goals. The procedure
of organizing includes specifying how capital, machines, equipment, and people are most
effectively used.

William, T. (2007). "The heuristics of war: scientific method and the founders of operations
research." The British Journal for the History of Science 40(2): 251-274.
ABSTRACT [by the author]: This paper explores the relationship between operations
research (OR) as practiced during the Second World War and the claims of many of its
proponents that it constituted an application of scientific method. It begins with an
examination of the pre-war work of two of the most notable leaders in wartime OR, the
British experimental physicist Patrick Blackett and the American theoretical physicist
Philip Morse. Despite differences in their scientific work, each saw science as an
essentially creative act relying on the skill and judgment of the individual scientist in the
deployment of rational methods for the development of legitimate conclusions. When
scientists began to study military operations, their investigations were defined by the
technically sophisticated heuristic practices already surrounding military planning. They
did not seek to replace these practices with their own rational methods. Rather, they
became scholars of the military's methods and adapted their pre-war experience by
shifting their self-disciplined attitude to their own work to bodies of military knowledge.
Thus scientists learned so well to navigate an alien heuristic system that investigations

<-----Page 324----->HEURISTICS-BASED DECISION-MAKING

313

they conducted within it took on the characteristics that they judged defined scientific
work.

Williamson, O. E. (1981). "The economies of organization: the transaction cost approach."
American Journal of Sociology 87(3): 548-577.
ABSTRACT [by the author] The transaction cost approach to the study of economic
organization covers the transaction as the basic unit of analysis and considers transaction
cost as central to the study of organizations. This approach applies both the determination
of efficient boundaries between firms and markets, and to the organization of
international transactions, including the design of employment relations. The approach is
compared and contrasted with selected parts of organization theory literature.

ABSTRACT [by the authors]: Traditional approaches to knowledge management have
centered around two distinct perspectives: that of knowledge as a product and knowledge
as a process. Ron Young and Gregoris N. Mentzas believe that for a KM initiative to be
truly effective, a fusion of the two approaches should be adopted. To this end, they
describe the Knowledger project, one of the world‘s first truly holistic and integrated
knowledge management solutions.

Zohar, D. (1995). "A quantum mechanical model of consciousness and the emergence of ‗I‘,
Minds and Machines " Minds and Machines 5(4).
ABSTRACT [by the author]: There have been suggestions that the unity of consciousness
may be related to the kind of holism depicted only in quantum physics. This argument
will be clarified and strengthened. It requires the brain to contain a quantum system with
the right properties- a "Bose-Einstein condensate". It probably does contain one such
system, as both theory and experiment have indicated. In fact, we cannot pay full
attention to a quantum whole and its parts simultaneously, though we may oscillate
between the two. In a quantum theory of consciousness, emergent meanings arise as an
inevitable consequence of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
