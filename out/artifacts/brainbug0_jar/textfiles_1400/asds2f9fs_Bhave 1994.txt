VENTURE CREATION

The process model of entrepreneurial venture creation developed in this
paper is based on interviews with entrepreneurs who started twenty-seven
businesses in a range of industries in upstate New York. The venture
creation process described here is an iterative, nonlinear, feedbackdriven, conceptual, and physical process.
The model includes internally and externally stimulated opportunity
recognition, commitment to physical creation, set-up of production technology, organization
creation, product creation, linking with markets, and customer feedback. For analytical convenience,
the process has been divided into the opportunity stage, the technology set-up and organizationcreation stage, and the exchange stage. Business concept, production technology, and product are
respectively the core variables representing the three stages.
Entrepreneurs introduce differing amounts of novelty at each core variable during venture
creation, and the varying amounts of novelty qualitatively distinguish one kind of entrepreneurship
from another.
For the researcher, the model suggests a better method for specifying samples of entrepreneurial
firms. It sh0n.s how studies on the context of venture creation can be more specific, and proposes that
novelty at the core variables be operationalized as a step toward defining the entrepreneurial content
of ventures.
For the prospective entrepreneur, the model will serve as a useful road map. It will alert the
entrepreneur to the strategic issues at each stage in the venture creation process, particularly when
introducing significant novelty at any of the core variables.

Venture creation is the process that roughly begins with the idea for a business and culminates
when the products or services based upon it are sold to customers in the market.
Descriptive accounts of venture creation are available as case studies in numerous texts
(Timmons 1990). Sequences in venture creation presented as flow models exist at various
levels of detail (Gartner 1985; Moore 1986; Vesper 1980; Webster 1976; Webster 1977). Life
cycle views of ventures’ growth and decline are also available (Kazanjian 1988; Kazanjian
and Drazin 1990; Churchill and Lewis 1983; Kimberly and Miles 1980). And more recently,
network models of venture creation have been proposed (Larson and Starr 1993). The
categories and variables in the literature are often broad, apply to all ventures, and reveal no
nuances among individual ventures. Others are excessively detailed and apply only to
ventures in particular fields (VanderWerf 1993; Vesper 1980). Data-based process models of
the steps leading to the birth of new ventures, however, are absent in the literature (Van de
Ven 1992).
It would seem that the literature in mainstream economics, where the firm is a common
unit for analysis, would offer insights into the processes of the birth of firms (Leff 1979;
Ieibenstein
1968; Baumol 1968; Evans 1949). Unfortunately, economics literature also fails
in this respect. First, economists are not generally concerned with individual firms; the firm
in the theory of the firm is a representative firm from an aggregate rather than any individual
firm (Penrose 1980). Second, though recognized as important, entrepreneurship
is poorly
integrated into mainstream economics theory (Casson 1982), and few economists save those
of the Austrian school emphasize its study. In sum, both researchers of organizations and
entrepreneurship
(Bull and Willard 1993; Kirchhoff 1991; Bygrave 1989a,l989b; Katz and
Gartner 1988; Kimberly 1979; Low and Macmillan 1988) and economists (Ioasby 1982;
Baumol 1968; Buchanan 1979, 1982; Kirzner 1973, 1979; Nelson and Winter 1982) agree
that the processes of the birth of firms need better understanding.
This study aims to generate a grounded-theoretical,
integrative process model of
entrepreneurial
firm creation by linking conceptual categories and subprocesses in the firm
creation process identified from interview data (Glazer and Strauss 1967; Yin 1989).
AN ENCOMPASSING

PROCESS VIEW-ITS

NEED AND ABSENCE

Process studies can fulfill several needs at the present stage of entrepreneurship
Provide an Integrative

research.

Framework

Firms vary vastly in their characteristics as do the entrepreneurs who create them (Gartner
1985). On one hand, studies of entrepreneurship
must generate generalizable conclusions
about variables relevant to all new firms. On the other hand, each business is conceived in
facing the
extremely
individualistic
and personal ways, with myriad circumstances
entrepreneurs at start-up. Further, several disciplines study entrepreneurship
from respective
viewpoints. As a result, there is a bewildering variety of research on the subject. Organizing
this variety in order to draw generalizable conclusions is a thorny, unresolved, and central
problem of entrepreneurship
theory (Cheah 1990; Wortman 1987; Bygrave 1989a, 1989b;
Low and MacMillan
1988). The process model developed here provides an infegrutive
framework to bring cohesion to this vast body of existing literature. And to the extent this
model successfully integrates disparate bodies of research, it contributes to the advancement
of entrepreneurship
theory (Bacharach 1989; Whetten 1989).

Integrate Subprocesses
The model will also help to integrate certain subprocesses that have been well studied. For
example, Timmons et al. (1987) have described opporhtnity recognition as an important
process in entrepreneurship.
Processes of new product introduction
and responding to
customer feedback are also relevant to entrepreneurship
(Lambkin 1988; Lieberman and
Montgomery 1988; Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, and Lyman 1990; Maidique and Zirger 1985;
Child 1972). An overarching process model is necessary to integrate and place these
phenomena in the context of entrepreneurial firm creation.

Facilitate Impact of Context Studies
According to Van de Ven, Hudson, and Schroeder (1984), the links between the context and
critical elem.ents in the venture creation process are not clearly known. This is because
theoretical concepts in the process are not well established. If they were, it would be possible
to explore specifically the impact of the context upon the various steps in the venture creation
process (Dorfman 1983; Dunkelberg et al. 1987; Pennings 1982a, 1982b). At present, despite
good correlations between contexts favoring firm creation and the actual emergence of firms,
we have no explanation of the birth of firms (Van de Ven 1993; Bollinger, Hope, and
Utterback 1983; Calvin 1984). This paper identifies new conceptual
categories and
subprocesses in firm creation, and thereby facilitates studies of the impact of context upon it.

Facilitate Comparison

with Internal Corporate Venturing (ICV)

Comparisons between internal corporate venturing (ICV) (Kanter et al. 1990; Pinchot 1985;
Fast 1979) and entrepreneurial firm creation processes are not possible because there are no
well-grounded
process models of entrepreneurial
firm creation. If process models in
entrepreneurship could be compared to process models of ICV (Burgelman 1983; Homsby et
al. 1993), we would be able to distinguish the entrepreneurial elements from the functional
elements in both processes. Theoretical and practical insights from such studies would be
valuable for entrepreneurs, managers, and researchers.

Facilitate Taxonomy Building
Research populations of entrepreneurial firms (and entrepreneurs) are often selected along
convenient (e.g., industry, size, technology, or region) rather than taxonomic dimensions.
Results from samples of firms chosen along convenient dimensions rarely extend to all firms
along such dimensions (McKelvey 1982). Comparative process studies of new venture
creation are necessary in order to define taxonomic populations of entrepreneurial
firms
(Hambrick 1984; Gartner, Mitchell, and Vesper 1989). This paper develops one of the first
process studies helpful for taxonomy building.
Two reasons explain the absence of grounded process models of firm creation. First,
process studies are time-consuming
and difficult to conduct with limited resources, and
interdisciplinary process studies are even more difficult than those within a well-defined field.
Entrepreneurship
studies, spread across academic boundaries, require the researcher to be
familiar with multiple literatures, diverse methodological perspectives, and different units of
analysis (Van de Ven 1992; Low and MacMillan 1988; Kilby 1971; Wortman 1987).
Second, at a simplistic and intuitive level, the stages in venture creation appear to be
well identified, though only rarely is the existence of the stages substantiated by empirical

<-----Page 3----->226

M.P. BHAVE

evidence (Montanari et al. 1990; Venkataraman et al. 1990; Venkataraman
1989; Ruhnka
and Young 1987). Further, case studies in entrepreneurship
and ICV seemingly describe the
processes of venture creation (Kanter 1983, 1989; Kidder 198 1). Researchers therefore use
cross-sectional
methods to study parts of the entrepreneurial
process (Kimberly 1979).
Cross-sectional entrepreneurial research has several limitations. First, the phenomenon
under study cannot be placed in a holistic context. Second, the relative weight of the
phenomenon in the overall process is not known. Third, unless we can generate taxonomic
samples of entrepreneurial
firms, cross-sectional results have only limited external validity
(Cook and Campbell 1979). We know that only a fraction of new ventures use venture capital.
In the absence of taxonomic samples, the generalizability of conclusions from cross-sectional
studies about venture capital use is therefore suspect.
In sum, practical difficulties, the dominant received tradition of cross-sectional research,
and the interdisciplinary
nature of entrepreneurship all explain the absence and point out the
need for empirical process studies of entrepreneurship.

METHODOLOGY,

RESPONDENTS,

AND VALIDITY

Simon (1969) writes, “One should not let one’s discipline determine the choice of method;
rather, one should fit the method to the problem.” Further, “entrepreneurship
is one of the
youngest paradigms in management sciences” (Bygrave 1989a, p.7), there is no general
agreement on the defining concepts and variables characterizing it, and the processes of the
birth of firms are not well understood (Low and MacMillan 1988). Given this situation, an
exploratory field study involving
interviews,
“mapping
systems” according to Simon
(1969), was undertaken to obtain an overview of venture creation processes.
All respondents were selected from a city in upstate New York. They represented both
genders, various professions, different social classes, and different age groups. The city has
a diverse economic base, uninfluenced by the presence of any one industry or company. The
businesses selected comprise the categories in Table 1. The aim in selecting particular
businesses was to cover a variety, both in manufacturing and services, in high-technologybased fields as well as the more traditional areas. The set is not a random sample, but given
that taxonomic samples of entrepreneurial firms cannot be identified at the present (Gartner,
Mitchell, and Vesper 1989; McKelvey
1982; Webster 1977), it did fairly represent
entrepreneurial businesses in the region (Yin 1989).
The interviewing technique involved asking an open-ended question to introduce a topic
(Payne 1951; Bradbum and Sudman 1979). This gave the respondents considerable leeway in
giving answers. Based on respondents’ answers, and if additional information was necessary,
probing questions were asked. With successive interviews, themes and issues recurred within
each business category and across all categories. By the twentieth interview, approximately
five in each category, there was repetition of process-related detail. Additional interviews
were carried out to ensure external validity. Given that interviewing
is expensive and
time-intensive,
the number of interviews
conducted
is believed to be adequate for
generalizations about the entrepreneurial process.
Once the model was developed, it was presented to a group of entrepreneurs in the
region, most of whom had participated in the interviews, to test if it captured the complexity
of the process and whether it matched their experiences (Yin 1989). Their feedback was
incorporated into the model.

Model Development
Numerous sequences in venture creation are available in the literature (Vesper 1980). For
example, Gartner (1985), has stated that the entrepreneur locates a business opportunity,
accumulates resources, markets products and services, produces the product, builds an
organization, and responds to government and society. This broad description of the venture

<-----Page 5----->228

M.P. BHAVE

creation process, being applicable to all new ventures, served as the starting point for
organizing data (Eisenhardt 1989; Bogdan and Bilken 1982).
The interview data were transcribed to generate case studies. Next, all quotes and facts
from the transcripts that related to opportunity recognition, technology, customer, product,
and so on, were listed together and closely examined for patterns. Assembling and analyzing
was carried out for all known themes and variables in venture creation. Conceptual categories
and subprocesses emerged inductively from this examination,
and were then refined and
linked to generate the model. No conscious, preconceived theory guided their identification
(Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 1989; Burgelman 1983; Glazer and Strauss 1967; Simon 1969).
The method of drawing inferences and identifying conceptual categories parallels the
methods used by Burgelman (1983) in studying internal corporate venturing. The resulting
model based on grounded data offers an integrated view of firm creation starting from
opportunity recognition through to the first sale and customer feedback.
In this paper, the word “firm” is used to denote a conceptual entity and “venture” or
“business” to mean an actual business. Data about each venture are classified into conceptual
categories in Table 1. The assigned values of “high” or “low” are adequate for first-order
analysis but need to be refined in future research. To illustrate the issues, direct quotations are
used wherever possible. Respondents are identified by their initials to maintain confidentiality. “Product” refers to both manufactured goods and services.

SUBPROCESSES

AND CONCEPTUAL

CATEGORIES FROM DATA

When answers to the question, “Could you tell me how you began your business?”
were
assembled, it was apparent that diverse personal circumstances
prompt venture creation.
Upon closer examination, two distinct routes in the opportunity recognition process were
discerned. They are described under “externally
stimulated opportunity recognition”
and
“internally stimulated opportunity recognition,”
and are shown in Figure 1.

Externally

Stimulated

Opportunity

Recognition

The decision to start a venture preceded opportunity recognition for certain entrepreneurs.
The decision was influenced by the entrepreneurs’ persona1 and environmental circumstances
at that time. For example, some entrepreneurs in the set decided to begin at particular stages
in their persona1 lives, some when their employers decided to relocate and they did not wish
to move, and some because they could not bear to work for others any longer. The reasons
given were numerous and specific to the individuals at the time. But what all had in common
was that the decision to start a venture preceded the choice of a particular opportunity for
committed pursuit.
Here are IC’s words describing how he started his specialty publishing and consulting
venture:
I had been in the same level in the company for five years. I was blocked off from the top
job in my field, and at the same time, I was approaching my - birthday. I had been talking
about it (starting my own business) for years. Here I am, reasonably in possession of my

faculties, and so I thought this is as good a time as any.
Most entrepreneurs who decided to begin ventures in this manner recognized vastly
more opportunities than they seriously chose to pursue. Their effort was to avoid getting
distracted by these recognized opportunities. In HM’s words:

. . . th’ere are so many opportunities out there, oh, so many . . . every time an opportunity
comes along, I think I’m supposed to take advantage of it. So I get lost, who knows where,
until it becomes apparent I have no experience to know how to make it happen, no base of
knowledge. So I see lots of opportunities every time I turn around, but I (tell myself) that’s
not where you belong . . .
The decision to start was therefore followed by a search to align the prospective
entrepreneurs’
knowledge, experience, skills and other resources with market needs. In
seeking this alignment, entrepreneurs eliminated inappropriate opportunities. In the end, only
one, or a few, were chosen for committed pursuit. There was thus afihution
ofopportunities
from among a host of recognized ones (Long and McMullan 1984).
Once the commitment to pursue particular opportunities was made, entrepreneurs refined
the opportunities. PA described this as the “massaging” of ideas: “an entrepreneur may see
an idea and massage the idea until he makes it a good idea. If someone had looked at the idea
previously, without the entrepreneurial glasses on, he may not see it in the same vein.” The
massaging, or elaboration, or rejhement of opportunities chosen (Rockey 1986) resulted in
the identification of business concepts.
Once entrepreneurs had focused on respective business concepts, they could easily
articulate aspects of their ventures that distinguished them from those of others in the same
field. To illustrate, in JM’s words:
the product we are handling is very up-scale in terms of price, quality and performance.
We’re not in the lower level where there’s competition. Our niche is high up for
sophisticated systems and exotic materials.
HM said:
I believe that we are all unique and we’ve got our own little piece that will make it different
than anyone else even though we look alike, sound alike, and walk like everyone else.

but there is one that separates us and that’s one

In over half of the businesses (59 %), the decision to start a venture was followed by
opportunity
recognition
and opportunity
filtration.
An opportunity
suitable
to the
entrepreneur was chosen for committed pursuit. The chosen opportunity was refined to arrive
at the business concept. Opportunities
identified and pursued in this way, after an
“opportunistic
search” (Cyert and March 1963), are defined as “externally
stimulated
opportunities.”

Internally Stimulated Opportunity

Recognition

For some entrepreneurs, opportunity recognition preceded the decision to start their ventures.
The prospective entrepreneurs experienced, or were introduced to, needs that could not be
easily fulfilled through available vendors or means. They tried, on their own or with others,
to find their own solutions to satisfy the needs. At this stage, the entrepreneurs did not always
realize that the needs they sought to fulfill were broad and that businesses could be created in
fulfilling them. Because the business objectives were not clearly recognized yet, this stage is
referred to as the meta-opportunity stage.
Once solutions to satisfy the needs were found, the business possibilities
became
apparent. Over time, the business possibilities
became attractive and the decision to
start ventures was made. This was again followed by rejinement of opportunities, which led
to the identification of business concepts.
SW started his violin repair business as follows:
I couldn’t find anyone I had enough faith in to repair violins I was playing, so I started
repairing myself, and the word got around that I would do that. So I started doing that. After
a while it got to be a burden to do it for free, and I started charging people for it.
GB’s business in medical electronics had similar origins. A doctor friend casually
expressed
the need for certain kinds of measurements.
Instruments
to take those
measurements did not exist. As a researcher in electronics, GB realized that an instrument
could be built to fulfill this need, and took up the challenge to do so. A prototype was soon
assembled in his laboratory. A refined version of the prototype became the basis of GB’s
multimillion dollar business.
A good many businesses (41%) in the set started in this way. A personal need was first
identified and then fulfilled. The realization that the need was widespread led to the
recognition of the business opportunity. The opportunity was refined to define the business
concept. This was followed by a commitment
to pursue the opportunity.
Opportunities
recognized and pursued after “problemistic
search” (Cyert and March 1963) are defined as
“internally stimulated opportunities.”

Business Concept and Business Concept Development
Both externally and internally stimulated opportunity recognition processes culminated in the
identification
of the business concept. Its identification
is evidence of the successful
completion
of the subprocesses
of opportunity filtration, opportunity
selection, and
opportunity refinement in venture creation as indicated in Figure 1.
Every venture had locational, product-market, or other features that were unique and gave
the business competitive advantage. Every venture also was located at a certain point on an

<-----Page 8----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

231

evolving industry structure and trajectory, and the dynamics of that industry structure created for
the venture certain opportunity windows, advantages, and risks (Roure and Keeley 1990; Roure
and Maidique 1986). At this point, the businesses were defined with sufficient focus so that the
entrepreneurs could succinctly describe respective business concepts (Abel1 1980).
When these statements were examined, it was evident that most ventures were based on
business concepts familiar to respective customers. Only a small fraction of the businesses
were based on truly novel business concepts. In Table 1, these are shown to have high
business concept novelty while the rest have low business concept novelty.
Though a business concept may be defined well enough for an entrepreneur to start a
new venture, it may not be congruent with or sufficiently matched with customer needs
(Block and h4acMillan 1985). This was true for two of the three businesses with high business
concept novelty. They had to further develop their business concept (MacMillan, Zemann,
and Narasimha 1987; Hofer and Sandberg 1987).
Business concept development refers to the effort involved in clarifying the business
concept in order to achieve a good fit between customer needs and the entrepreneur’s
perceptions of those needs. When business concepts were novel, there were no precedents nor
any customer feedback to guide the entrepreneurs. They had to introduce their products to
customers, receive feedback, and only then develop further their business concept until a close
match with customer needs was established (Maidique and Zirger 1985).
Business concept development was not an issue for entrepreneurs whose businesses had
low business concept novelty. This was because other businesses existed that fulfilled similar
customer needs, and the level of business concept resolution necessary for a good fit with
customers was generally known. Entrepreneurs had only to achieve comparable or slightly
different or better clarification of their business concepts.
High blusiness concept novelty not only demanded the effort at business concept
development,
but also posed serious marketing challenges. JA’s idea of selling product
innovation c,onsulting services was novel at the time he began. Convincing customers was
extraordinarily
difficult for him because customers were unused to contracting for such
services. He had to overcome the resistance of organizational bureaucracies and their fear of
trying out something new (Schumpeter 1934). He described his plight as follows:
I thought these companies will be happy to find ways to. . . that they would need this kind
of service. But the fact of the matter was that they weren’t ready for it and didn’t
understand what it was. From my point of view, if I had gotten in the pizza business, it
would have been easier. You know what that is. What I was doing was missionary
work-education
for the client.
GB’s product when first introduced was “too researchy”
and failed from a
“market point of view.” His customers did not know what it was or how it worked. GB had
to further develop his business concept, educate customers, and be educated by them before
his product found customer acceptance. JA and GB had to create markets.
Most entrepreneurs in the set, however, responded to markets. In SB’s words:
Similarly,

The market essentially exists. I think that small companies by and large do not create
markets. They are too small. By and large they have to find something within an existing
area. Entrepreneurs don’t have staying power. It requires a lot of money, a long time . . .
creating a new market is an extremely difficult, treacherous, and expensive affair.

HM’s business also had high business concept novelty, but the need for her product was
well-recognized
at that time. Fortunately for HM, there was congruence between customer
needs and HM’s perceptions of those needs. There was little need for customer education, and

<-----Page 9----->232

M.P. BHAVE

marketing did not pose a serious challenge. It was as if HM had found a timely and a novel
cure for a long known illness. Though the business concept was novel, it did not require effort
at business concept development or at market creation.
Whereas both JA and GB began their ventures from internally stimulated opportunity
recognition, HM began from externally stimulated opportunity recognition. Future research
will have to explore whether entrepreneurial
effort at business concept development and
marketing is greater when high business concept novelty is accompanied by internally
stimulated opportunity recognition.

Commitment

to Physical Creation

The processes culminating in business concept identification, whether internally or externally
stimulated, required varying amounts of time for different respondents. Further, most of this
effort was intangible, and generally required entrepreneurs’ personal resources, mostly time.
As JW explained:
For the better part of two years, I was busy developing ideas, getting myself organized, and
ready to make a move. It wasn’t an overnight decision . . . No question, a lot of- thought
went into it, and has to go into it . . . You don’t do it quickly, or lightly, or without proper
planning, or preparation.
To proceed beyond business concept identification, entrepreneurs required physical and other
resources that were beyond most respondents’ private means. An organization had to be
created and production technology set up to transform the business concept into a marketable
product. The decision to seek and invest outside resources to pursue the venture with
commitment was a significant stage in the venture creation process. In DK’s words:
. . . that I can do this in a laboratory doesn’t mean a squat; it’s useless information. Who’s
going to make a thousand tons of it and by what procedure? How do you jump from a
beaker [which is] a good idea you can demonstrate . . . Can you take it from this size and
jump to that size? (emphasis added).
The really critical
and strike out on their
and accept all the pain
a significant transition

step according to PS is “when a person or a group of persons get up
own . . . when they have accepted the fact that they are going to do it
that is going to occur. ” The commitment to physical creation is thus
point in venture creation.

Production Technology and Production Technology Development
Production technology set-up and organization creation followed the commitment to physical
creation. The principal technological apparatus for service businesses in the set was the
expertise and knowledge of the entrepreneurs. Beyond basic office facilities and equipment,
their resource needs at start-up were modest. Certain other businesses in the set required
considerable resources for the set up of production technology. Sources of funding varied
widely; many respondents used personal funds, some had venture capitalist backing, and at
least one was partially funded by a parent company. Many skirted with bankruptcy for lack
of funds, and a few had failed before in earlier ventures.
For all the visible variety and the differing resource needs, however, all businesses in the
set except a few used standard equipment and technology to create respective products. Only
the few businesses having “high” production technology novelty (Table 1) developed their
technologies
in their laboratories.
Successful

development of the underlying technology, introduced uncertainty, required risk capital, and
made venture creation qualitatively more hazardous for these businesses.
Compared to the time devoted to discussing opportunity recognition, feedback from
customers, environmental factors beyond entrepreneurs’ control, or technological and market
uncertainty,
respondents
hardly talked about organization
creation and the set-up of
production technology. Gathering resources and maintaining their availability-financial
and
other-was
viewed as something to be taken care of, or obtained as a utility, rather than as an
issue of strategic consequence. This is paradoxical and instructive given that the mechanics
of resource gathering and organization creation is the very substance of texts and much
research, and the most visible stage in venture creation. The only exceptions were the few
cases where novel technology was being developed in the venture creation process. Once
overcome, resource issues were narrated as humorous war stories. In DK’s words: “We went
to zero thrice in one year,” or “Venture capitalists? Good people, but they gamble. There are
no prophets in this business.”

Organization

Creation

Organization creation occurred in parallel with the set-up of production technology for all
ventures. Organization creation refers to the building of the physical structure as well as
organizational processes that surround production technology at the core (Thompson 1967).
Over half the businesses (59%) were less than five years old at the time of interviews.
Many had not stabilized operationally, and organizational structures and practices were at
various stages of evolution. Departmental boundaries were fluid, functional differentiation
was limited, and titles meant little. Work was distributed among partners as much along
respective specializations as convenience. The entrepreneurs, as is proverbially described,
wore many hats. Feedback from customers as well as learning led to formalization;
what
worked in the previous iteration was continued until change was indicated. With every
iteration, additional resources were put into the venture for growth (MacMillan 1983).
In their formlessness and frenetic pace, the new organizations resembled “synthetic
organizations”
(Thompson 1967), that is, organizations
created to provide relief during
natural calamities such as famines or floods, and where little attention is paid to functional
differentiatllon. But whereas synthetic organizations
are disbanded when the emergency
prompting their creation is over, the newly created ventures concentrated on generating new
customers, ‘creating better products, and growth.

Product and Product Development
About one-third of the businesses introduced “high” novelty products to customers (Table
1). High product novelty was generally accompanied by product development. In certain
computer-based services and electronics-based ventures, there was product development even
for low novelty products due to customization. Just as in business concept or production
technology development, product development consumed resources, often delayed product
introduction, and added to uncertainty and risk.
Entrepreneurs viewed products in their relationship to customers and markets, and as
embodiments and subsets of business concepts. The product was, as it were, a marketable
form of the business concept, to be changed as dictated by customer needs. Sometimes
customer needs changed rapidly, driven by rapid technical change in certain industries. The
product (and sometimes the business concept) had to be equally rapidly modified to satisfy
changing customer needs. Entrepreneurs in such industries had to constantly and feverishly

<-----Page 11----->234

M.P. BHAVE

evaluate their business concepts in relationship to current markets. In stable industries, the
evaluation of business concepts and products with respect to markets was a low-key activity
for entrepreneurs (Sandberg and Hofer 1987; Meyer and Roberts 1986).
The evaluation carried out by the entrepreneur between the business concept and product
on one hand, and customers and markets on the other, suggests the existence of a boundary
between the entrepreneurial
firm and its customers. The entrepreneur and the new venture
belong on the supply side of the boundary whereas the market lies on the demand side.

The Supply and Demand Boundary
Chronologically
or linearly viewed, marketing the product across the supply and demand
boundary is the next step in venture creation. The reality for most respondents was not quite
so linear. Although individual arrangements varied, most had their initial customers lined up
well before product creation. It was only when there was a customer, or a fairly guaranteed
potential customer, that the physical creation of a venture began (Block and MacMillan 1985).
The existence of initial customers, however, was no guarantee of future customers in
sufficient numbers. JM feared additional customers would not exist, that the “phone will
never ring.”
As indicated earlier, all entrepreneurs
did not confront comparable challenges in
introducing their products across the supply and demand boundary. The greatest difficulty
was faced by those who sought to introduce novel business concepts (embodied in suitable
products) that required major customer education. This was either because of the slow and
uncertain rate of customer learning, or the business concept was too early for the market, or
it was poorly aligned with customer needs.

Customer Feedback-Strategic

and Operational

Linking with markets and evaluating and acting upon initial customer feedback are the
concluding steps in venture creation. Introducing products to customers generated feedback
for the entrepreneurs. Are sufficient numbers of customers interested in the product? Is the
quality as desired? Do the features fulfill most contingencies
in use? Is the product priced
“right”?
Certain feedback affected the competitive stance of a venture, yet did not threaten its
existence. Certain other feedback, however, threatened the business itself. To illustrate, in
GB’s words:
What they (marketing) come up with are revisions ofexisting equipment, which is fine, for
it is an improvement. There are typical ways of competing-we
have features and two
more and the price is IO percent less. That has validity. But all of a sudden you come up
with a new approach to the problem, and all of you folks are obsolete, no matter what
features (emphasis added).
indicates feedback regarding the
The need for “revisions
of existing equipment”
product features or product quality. But “new approach to the problem” is feedback affecting
the business concept. It signals the emergence of substitutes in the market or radically
different customer needs. Failure to act upon this feedback could undermine the very
business.
A signal affecting the business concept is sfruregicfeedback (Ansoff 1988; Child 1972;
Maidique and Zirger 1984, 1985), because it addresses the entrepreneur’s conception of the
entire venture itself. If the difference between an entrepreneur’s perception of customer needs

and actual customer needs is large, a major reorientation of the venture is indicated. Signals
calling for improvements
in quality, on the other hand, indicate the need for changes in
production technology. If these signals are strong, a new generation of technology may be
necessary. Signals for additional or altered features in products suggest the need for product
changes. The latter two signals are operating feedback (Ansoff 1988) in that they require
operational and tactical changes but do not directly threaten the validity of the business
concept itself.
Feedback also appeared to have afrequency factor associated with it that called for quick
responses (Child 1972). In GB’s words:
We were in a market where twenty new entrants came in every year and we had lots of
competition. We were holding on, increasing and kept developing new products. We had
to diversify into more product lines, which we did. Each is a major risk . . . to continue to
grow at that fast rate would require continually going out and borrowing more funds . . . if

THREE PRINCIPAL STAGES IN ENTREPRENEURIAL
The conceptual

FIRM CREATION

categories and subprocesses discussed above are linked to generate the
process model in Figure 2. For analytical purposes, and in order to elaborate upon the
theoretical issues emerging from the model, it is divided into the three main stages, and an
appropriate core variable is chosen to represent each. The stages are demarcated by natural
transition points in the venture creation process.
Both internally and externally stimulated opportunity recognition sequences culminate
in business concept identification. This is followed by the commitment to begin-a
distinct
step. The commitment to physical creation separates a hitherto invisible process from the
subsequent visible one, and it is a natural transition point between two stages. Events in

<-----Page 13----->236

M.P. BHAVE

venture creation up to this point are therefore grouped into the opportunity stage, and business
concept is chosen as the core variable to represent it.
After the commitment to physical creation, entrepreneurs garner resources and use them
toward technology set-up, organization creation and marketing. This is the most visible stage in
venture creation, and it concludes when a product ready for the customer is created for the first
time. Because production technology is at the heart of this subprocess, it is chosen as the core
variable representing the organization-creation
and set-up of production technology stage.
Once an idea is transformed into a product and sold across the supply and demand
boundary to customers for the first time, the entrepreneurial
loop is complete. Customers
directly evaluate the product, and generate feedback, both strategic and operational. The
marketing efforts in venture creation as well as initial customer feedback and corrective action
are all grouped into the exchange stage, and the product produced is chosen as the core
variable to represent it.

THEORETICAL

ISSUES

THAT

EMERGE

FROM

THE

MODEL

Significance of the First Sale
The first sale is a significant conceptual event in new venture creation (Block and MacMillan
1985). This is because in making the first sale, the entrepreneur:
1. makes concrete the link between the business concept and the market that was recognized
in the opportunity stage. The first sale vindicates the business concept.
2. establishes an exchange relationship with customers for the first time. Customer feedback,
absent for the venture until now, becomes an input into a venture’s future direction.
3. bridges the boundary between the supply side and the demand side.
The first sale is the last step in the physical creation of a venture, though venture creation has
an iterative, conceptual component as described below.

Conceptual Process
Opportunities are recognized and evaluated by entrepreneurs with respect to markets. This
reciprocal correspondence between the opportunity stage and the market even before physical
creation is shown in Figure 2 by the dashed line linking business concept and market. After
physical creation, there is a more direct correspondence between the core variables and the
market, as indicated by the feedback signals. And even during the physical creation process,
the business concept may on occasion have to be modified according to the requirements of
production technology, and product specifications may also require changes in production
technology (Maidique and Zirger 1984). There is thus a reciprocal correspondence between
the business concept and production technology and between the product and production
technology.
Though the process in Figure 2 seems to follow a chronology, the feedback and
reciprocal correspondence among the elements in venture creation suggests the existence of
an iterative, conceprual process of venture creation, and of which the physical creation
process is but a part. It may not be farfetched to say that the conceptual process is at least
partially complete before the physical process begins, though refinements in it may continue
well after a business is in existence.
Though the conceptual process prior to, during, and subsequent to physical creation
cannot be directly measured, entrepreneurs value it immensely; it possibly explains their

<-----Page 14----->ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURE CREATION PROCESS MODEL

237

attachment to their businesses, and their reluctance to part with significant equity to venture
capitalists (Beann, Schiffel, and Mogee 1975; Gladstone 1988). The financial valuation of a
venture may be at odds with an entrepreneur’s subjective perception of value based on the
conceptual effort involved.

Novelty and Entrepreneurial

Content

When ventures in the set are viewed holistically with the aim of assessing the difficulty
involved in venture creation, it is apparent that difficulties principally arise from the existence
of high novelty at the core variables. This is because high novelty is generally resisted and the
entrepreneur has to overcome this resistance (Schumpeter 1942; Abetti and Stuart 1989;
Ansoff 1988; Meyer and Roberts 1986; Maidique 1980; Drucker 1985).
Though the general relationship of innovation to entrepreneurship
is well known, it is
seldom recognized that innovation in the entrepreneurial process can occur at all three core
variables, and that entrepreneurial ventures can be innovative at none, one, or more variables.
This suggests that the entrepreneurial content of a venture could be defined as a function of
the novelty or discontinuity introduced, and therefore of the resistance overcome, at the three
core variables.

Distinguishing

Among Ventures

The model in Figure 2 can be used to qualitatively distinguish one entrepreneurial
venture
from another based on the novelty at each core variable. A sizeable enterprise requiring large
amounts of capital and employing numerous workers at start-up can have low novelty at each
of the core variables. Though operationally complex, the uncertainty and the development
effort with respect to the business concept, the production technology, or the product could be
small. In contrast, a physically small venture may be based on complex conceptual
underpinnings;
it could have high novelty at more than one core variable.
This suggests that ventures could be classified based on comparable novelty embodied
at core variables. Doing so may yield clustering of ventures having more in common than
ventures classified along the traditional dimensions. Physically dissimilar businesses in
different industries may have comparable novelty at core variables, and therefore may have
more in common than ventures within the same industry. They may face comparable market
creation and strategic issues. In contrast, businesses within the same industry, though
physically similar, may face divergent strategic issues.
The literature surveyed for this research has found no attempt to classify ventures along
these lines, though the effort at typology building as a component of theory building appears
to be gaining momentum (Gartner, Mitchell, and Vesper 1989; Chrisman, Hofer, and Boulton
1988; Wortman 1987; Hambrick 1984).

Common Entrepreneurial

Dimensions

Entrepreneurship is a multidimensional phenomenon, and there is little agreement on common
dimensions characterizing it (Gartner, Mitchell, and Vesper 1989). This process model suggests
the use of business concept, production technology, and product as the preliminary set of core
dimensions. These variables are sequentially encountered in the creation of all firms, deal only
with the supply side of venture creation, and constitute a parsimonious set of variables. When
each core variable is evaluated for novelty+5ther
high, low or medium--it
gives rise to a
3x3x3 cube of sufficient discriminatory power for preliminary analysis.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
The process model developed in this study uncovers new ground as well as reaffirms some
known theoretical

issues in venture creation.

1. This study identifies conceptual categories and stages in the venture creation process
based on empirical, grounded data.
2. It links the conceptual categories and stages to develop a comprehensive, integrative
process model of new venture creation.
3. Despite its generality, the model has the ability to qualitatively
distinguish among
entrepreneurial ventures based on novelty introduced in the venture creation process at
each of the core variables.
4. It further indicates that novelty can be introduced at any of the three core variables, and
therefore, the adjective “innovative”
needs to be cautiously applied to entrepreneurs and
their ventures. Schumpeter’s
notion of innovation
as the defining characteristic
of
entrepreneurship
has thus been extended in this paper. Further it proposes that the
entrepreneurial content of a venture is a function of novelty introduced during the venture
creation process (Schumpeter 1934, 1942; Drucker 1985; Abetti and Stuart 1989).
5. The model suggests the existence of a conceptual process of new venture creation in
addition to the more obvious physical creation process. Further, it suggests that this
conceptual process is iterative, continues even after a venture is in existence, and is not
linear or chronological.
6. It suggests strategic gradations among entrepreneurial ventures, and cautions against
comparisons or groupings among firms along convenient dimensions.
7. Though the model recognizes critical entrepreneurial inputs at various stages in the venture
creation process, and acknowledges the role of the entrepreneur as the prime mover of the
process, it also suggests that in principle, the entrepreneurial process can be viewed as a
junction that can be carried out by an organization. Schumpeter did not rule out the
absorption of the entrepreneurial function into mainstream business (Schumpeter 1942). In
fact, internal corporate venturing may be viewed as bureaucratized entrepreneurship.
8. The model reafirms the existence of strategic and operation feedback (Maidique and
Zirger 1985) in venture creation. It concludes with existing research that the first sale is an
important conceptual event in venture creation (Block and MacMillan 1985).

Implications

for Future Research

The model developed

above suggests the following

for future research:

1. Testing for the accuracy, completeness,
and the relative weight of the concepts and
subprocesses identified remains a future project. Though the data gathered are sufficient to
develop the model, it is insufficient to address such issues as: are business concept
development and marketing efforts greater when opportunities are internally stimulated
rather than externally stimulated?
2. How similar or different are the processes of internal corporate venturing
and
entrepreneurship?
Additional comparative research into the two processes is necessary to
explore the common and contrasting features.
3. Future empirical research is needed to test whether the entrepreneurial content of a venture

<-----Page 16----->ENTREPRENEURIAL

VENTURE CREATION PROCESS MODEL

239

is indeed proportional to the novelty introduced at the core variables as suggested here.
Entrepreneurial
content needs to be suitably operationalized,
and novelty scales for each
core variable need to be developed.
4. This paper indicates that typologies of entrepreneurial
ventures can be developed using
novelty at each of the core variables as the basis. Typologies so developed will aid the
definition of taxonomic samples, and thereby enhance the external validity of research
studies in entrepreneurship.
5. Internally and externally stimulated opportunity recognition, the three core variables, the
role of novelty, the commitment to physical creation, the importance of the first sale,
strategic and operational feedback and other conceptual categories, as well as the
interrelationships
among them, emerged in the process of analyzing transcript data. Some
of these have been recognized previously in the literature as significant. The identification
of these critical variables and subprocesses characterizing entrepreneurship points out the
suitability, and indeed the advisability, of using ethnographic methodologies in emerging
research areas such as entrepreneurship.
Otherwise, conceptual categories and processes
central to the emerging field will remain hidden, cross-sectional research will be limited
to known concepts, and the advancement of knowledge in the field will remain stunted.
