Growth: A First Step Towards a Theory 

of Institutional Innova Non

INTRODUCTION

HIS paper attempts to provide an explanation of the formation
and mutation of economic institutions. I t is specifically concerned with that process as it has developed over the past one
hundred and seventy-five years of American history, but with appropriate changes the model might be used to predict institutional
change in the future and to explain institutional change in other
nations and in other eras.' Like more traditional theory, the model
has been formulated in a manner that makes it in principle operational, although we admit that it predicts relatively little. Profit
maximization is the motivating force, and in this sense too the
model fits into the stream of neo-classical economics, although like
the macro models of Keynes its subject has not traditionally been
considered a part of that discipline. Finally, we admit that the
theory is at some points woefully weak and the explanations at
times incredibly simplistic. The work, however, does, we feel, represent a first step towards a useful theory of institutional change.
Historians have traditionally displayed an interest in the institutions within which human action occurs and much of their work
has involved an examination of the interaction between people and
these institutions. Economic historians, especially the "new" group,
have, on the other hand, focused their efforts on economically rational behavior as an explanation of past events; institutions have been
taken as given, and the "antiquarian" interests of the more traditional historians have sometimes been scorned. Perhaps because of
their concern with long-run change, traditional historians have rec-

ognized that institutions do have something to do with the speed
and pattern of economic growth ( a relationship that was obvious to
them but one that economists have only gradually perceived). Much
of history writing is devoted to the study of the evolution and
development of political, military, and social institutions; and just
as these sophisticated institutions have evolved through history, so
have complex economic institutions emerged to provide a part of
the framework within which a highly technical society can survive
and flourish. While there are few pieces of history that do not lean
heavily upon some form of theory, there has been, unfortunately,
little theory to help understand the phenomena of institutional
change, In the absence of such theory, history is limited to narration, classification, and description. There are relatively few historians who would willingly accept such a limitation.
If our model of institutional innovation is to be of any use, it
must be able to predict two kinds of things: (1) Given any established set of institutions and some disequilibrating force, the model
ought to predict whether the newly emerging institutions will be
purely individual, involve some form of voluntary cooperation, or
rely on the coercive power of government; ( 2 ) I t should provide
some estimate of the period of time that is likely to elapse between
the initiating disequilibrium and the establishment of the new (or
mutated) institutions.
A THEORY OF INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATION

Although the term "institution" has been a part of the vocabulary
of both economists and historians for at least a century, it has never
been clearly defined. At one time or another it has been used to
refer to organizations ( a bank, for example, is a financial institution), to the fundamental legal rules that govern the economic relations between people (the institution of private property), to a
person or a position (the president or presidency), and even at
times to something as slight as a particular document (the Mayflower Compact). We recognize that each of these subjects relates
in some way to the general types of "institutions," but to avoid
confusion it appears most reasonable to set our analysis in terms of
the "sub-institutional" categories-and to reserve the term "institution" for titles, introductions and conclusions. In this spirit let us
define:

<-----Page 3----->Institutional Innovation

133

1. The Institutional Environment as a set of fundamental political, social, and legal ground rules that govern economic and political
activity (rules governing elections, property rights, and the rights
of contract are examples of these ground rules). We do not deny
that these rules do change, that the changes alter the shape of
institutional innovation," that any general model of institutional
change should predict such changes in the environment; however,
we make no attempt to explain them and assume that while effecting
the predictions of the model they are exogenous to that model.
2. An Institutional:Arrangement as an arrangement between economic units that govern the ways in which these units can cooperate
or compete. The institutional arrangement is probably the closest
counterpart to the most widely used definition of the term institution. The arrangements may be formal or informal, they may involve
an organization or not, and they may be temporary or long lived.
The innovation of a new arrangement will alter the way that economic units can cooperate or compete, but the change may involve
a single individual, a group of individuals voluntarily cooperating
together, or the government (alone or in cooperation with one or
more individuals). The latter innovation, of course, involves some
legal change, but the former types, while resting on the legal structure that constitutes the environment, involve only the private sector
directly. I t is the process of innovation of these institutional arrangements that the model is designed to predict-specifically their
level (individual, voluntary cooperative, or governmental), and
their timing.
3. An Action Group as a decision-making unit whose decisions
govern this process of innovation. The unit may be a single individual or a group of individuals, but it is the action group that
recognized some potential income that they could receive if only
they could alter the institutional structure. They are, of course,
a subgroup of Schumpeter's innovating entrepreneurs, and within
the model it is they who initiate the process of arrangemental innovation. The action group always receives a portion of the income,
if their innovation is a success. They also have to pay a t least a
portion of the costs of innovation, but they may not have to pay
the operating costs of the new arrangement (if there are any).
4. A Secondary Action Group as a decision-making unit that has
been established (or whose activities have been modified) by some
change in the institutional arrangement to help effect the capture


'6

<-----Page 4----->Lance Davis; Doup-lass North 

of income for the action group. This group makes the tactical
decisions -that bring about the capture, but i t does not accrue all
of that income (it may, in fact, accrue none).
5. An Institutional Instrument as a document or device employed
by an action or a secondary action group to effect the capture of
the external income when applied within the new arrangemental
structure.
These five should be kept distinct and separate for the remainder
of our discussion. Some additional income is seen by the primary
action group; they, in turn, innovate a new arrangement; and within
that structure, either directly through the application of an institutional instrument or through the creation of a secondary action
group and that group's application of the instrument, the capture is
effected.
Institutional rearrangement to capture "external income" has come
from five sources. The first four have the common property that
the institutional rearrangement that effects their capture can lead
to an increase in total income so (in theory at least) the action
group can be made better off without anyone having been made
worse off (in fact, however, there are usually redistributive effects).
Finally, we are concerned with a certain set of changes (usually in
the institutional environment) that make it possible for someone
to innovate new arrangements that permit income to be redistributed. In these cases, however, since there has been no increase in
total income, someone (or some group) is worse off, if the innovation is successful. The four sources of greater total income include:
1. Economies of Scale in production are technological phenomena and yield lower per unit costs as the scale of production
increases, but the capture of these economies may involve a level of
output much larger or more complex than can be underwritten by
a simple form of business organization. In this case institutional
rearrangements may involve a more complex form of business organization or one with "legal rights" not available to the proprietorship.
2. Externalities exist when the economic unit that is charged
with making a production or consumption decision is not forced to
bear all the costs or does not accrue all the revenues from that decision. If the unit sees greater revenues than costs even though it fails
to recognize all revenues, or if it sees costs greater than revenues
even without the inclusion of the unaccounted costs, the existence of

<-----Page 5----->Institutional Innovation
'I

135

externalities" may cause no problems. If, however, the opposite
holds, the unit will always make the wrong decision from the social
point of view; and total income would always be increased if that
decision were changed in a fashion consistent with maximizing
total income. Even in the first case, if the externality has yielded
an economic unit of non-optimal size, income can be increased by
an appropriate weighing of all costs and revenues.
The history of the western railroads in the nineteenth century
provides an excellent example of such an externality. Railroads were
subject to some economies of scale; they represented the least expensive mode of transport for bulky agricultural commodities; and
they did not own all the land along their rights of way. As a result,
the decisions of the railroad management might yield a smaller than
optimum level of railroad construction.
In the American west (the railroads could not practice perfect
price descrimination), the landowners closest to the railroad would
have found their land rising in value more than their less fortunately
located neighbors, and, to this extent, a part of the profits from
the railroad accrued not to the railroad but to those fortunately
placed farmers. Within the context of existing institutional arrangements, the railroad's management may have chosen not to build,
since they were forced to pay all of the costs and they did not
accrue all of the revenues. Total income would have beeen increased
if some institutional arrangement could have been effected that
would permit the transfer of a portion of the total income from the
well located farmers to the railroads.
3. Risk-the inability to exactly predict the outcome of an event
-and a widespread aversion to such risk, can also distort economic
decisions, and lead to less than maximum total income.
I t is a fact of life that most persons are risk averters. In the
absence of risk aversion, an individual would be as willing to risk
a dollar for a possible return of a million if the odds were a million
to one as he would to risk a dollar for a potential profit of a dollar
when the outcome is certain. In fact, with the exception of the
very poor, most people appear to prefer the certain to the uncertain
outcome, for large gambles. If, as appears likely, risk aversion becomes stronger as the odds increase, its presence tends to bias
activities toward those with more certain outcomes and away from
those marked by a high variance of returns. Clearly, since the
expected value of the profits is higher in the high variance activities

<-----Page 6----->136

Lance Davis; Douglass North

that are not being undertaken than in the low variance activities
that are, total profits could be increased if some mechanism could
overcome the tendency toward risk aversion (that is, by concentrating the risk among those who are not averters), or by making
risky outcomes appear more certain. The former types of solutions
are usually achieved through the development of some speculative
side markets (and are considered here under market failures), but
the latter can often be achieved through insurance.
Not all risks are insurable, but when they are, institutional reorganization aimed at innovating insurance schemes can frequently
permit an increase in total profits. For insurance to be successful,
however, there must be some basis on which to assess the risks
accurately, and the insurance base must be broad enough to permit
that the risks be spread.
The flow of commerce and the processes of capital mobilization
and accumulation can both be greatly facilitated by an efficient
commercial banking system. On the other hand, the banks (because
their lending activities are based on fractional reserves and, therefore their "quick ratios" tend to be very low liquidity) are much
more subject to crises than are most other businesses. If crises lezd
to failure, such failure can, by making deposits and bank money
appear risky, reduce the system's ability to mobilize capital; and
total income could be increased if banks could be made to appear
less risky. In this case insurance could supply the answer, but such
insurance had to await an adequate "mortality table" and an organization with a geographical base wide enough to insure out from
under local conditions.
4. Market failure engendered by very high information costs
may also lead to an economic allocation of resources-an allocation
that could be improved (with the concomitant increase in total income) if some new arrangement can reduce the costs of that information. While economists tend to assume that all markets are characterized by compIete knowledge, in the real world information
is not cost free, and therefore, perfect markets (whose existence
depends on perfect knowledge) do not exist. The lower the cost of
information, of course, the better markets will operate. Even in
developed countries, however, markets are far from perfect, and
in an underdeveloped country the costs of information may be so
high that the markets do not operate at all.
In general, not only is information costly, but it is subject to in-

<-----Page 7----->Institutional Innovation

137

creasing returns, That is, one must frequently pay for information,
but the cost does not change much whether that information is used
to effect one, one hundred, or one thousand transactions. If information costs are substantial and if they are subject to decreasing
costs, it is likely that substantial profits are to be earned from increasing information flows and, therefore, reducing uncertainty. The
arrangement innovation that is most economical will likely be a
specialized firm capable of supplying the information and of achieving the potential economies of scale.
While there is no logical reason to assume that the high cost
of information might not lead to market failure even if the market
deals only with a single location and a single time period, it is
a fact that failure most often occurs when the markets must reach
across spatial or temporal barriers. In the absence of an adequate
information network (and other things being equal) the discounts
that entrepreneurs put on potential income because of the uncertainty tend to be higher the farther the potential buyer is (either
in time or space) from the location of the transaction. In fact,
these uncertainty discounts may be so high that the discounted
equilibrium price may be below zero and the markets not operate
at all.
Throughout most of the nineteenth century, there was an excess
demand for finance in western agriculture as new lands were opened
and as the activity became more finance intensive. Since commercial
banks tended to shy away from mortgage loans (in fact, it was
illegal for National Banks to make such loans until 1914) and since,
under any conditions, there was no formal mechanism to allow
eastern banks to buy western mortgages (the commercial paper
market was limited to short-term paper), there were potential profits
that could be realized if some new arrangement were to be innovated that could lower the cost of "uncertainty reducing" information in the east.
Although the profit does not come from an increase in total income, there are profits inherent in any arrangemental innovation
that leads to a redistribution of income. Since successful capture
means a loss to someone, the probabilities that such capture can be
effected without reliance on some governmental coercive power are
very smalL2 In these cases it is very likely that the gains can be cap2 The Mafia, for example, was able to effect an income redistribution by monopolizing the traffic in some illegal drugs. The monopolization, however, rested on

<-----Page 8----->Lance Davis; Douglass North 

tured only by the innovation of an arrangement that puts coercive
power in the hands of a governmental secondary action group or
that effects "enabling" legislation which permits some voluntary or
quasi-voluntary group to artificially alter the supply of inputs or
output of a good or service.
In the purely redistributive case, the external profits most often
emerge from some change in the institutional environment. That
change (which is exogenous to the model) might take the form of
an amendment in the constitutional rules governing the disposition
of private property, it might reflect an expansion of the franchise,
or it might come from some shift in the community's utility function
that alters their preferences between public and private solutions to
problems.
Thus, the adoption of the principle of indirect representation in
the United States Senate made that group particularly susceptible
to the blandishments of the lobbyists of special interest groupsY3
and
the innovation of protective tariffs (an arrangement that effected a
transfer of income from consumer and some producers to manufacturer) was a predictable response. The direct election of senators
has, since 1913, greatly reduced the power of the tariff lobbies, and,
after some delay, the result has been a series of legislative acts that
have redistributed income in the opposite direction.
On another level, the twentieth century has brought with it an
increased willingness on the part of citizens to let groups with "special competence" control their own affairs. Sometimes this bias
towards industrial self-regulation has made it possible for certain
primary action groups (the physicians, for example) to control entry into certain industries, and, as a result, to effect a redistribution
of income away from the many towards the members of that group.
For example, the American Medical Association's ability to control
both licensing of physicians and the accreditation of medical schools
has, since the first decade of the twentieth century, made its members the most highly paid professional group in the United States.
We have thus far specified the source of the potential profits external to the existing arrangemental structure and we have defined
some terms that we will use in our analysis. Let us now lay out
considerable extra-legal coercive power-a power that is available to relatively few
others in society.
a On the average, the more issues are involved in any election, the less any single
issue will weigh in the mind of the voter.

<-----Page 9----->Institutional Innovation

139

briefly the skeleton of the model which, when conjoined with the
state of the institutional environment, will (we hope) allow us to
predict something about the level and timing of arrangemental innovation.
In accordance with traditional theory, our basic assumption is
that the motivating factor in institutional change is the desire to
maximize profits. The type of model used is a variant of the "lagged
supply" one frequently employed in more traditional economics. In
a lagged supply model, a change in demand in one period of time
produces a supply response in a later period of time. In this model,
a change in the potential profits from arrangemental innovation induces after some delay (or lag) the innovation of a new arrangement capable of capturing those profits for the innovators.
Assume an initial equilibrium. That is, a state where, given prevailing conditions, no change in the institutional structure could
yield additional income to any individual or group of individuals in
the economy. Such a condition could exist if: (1) all potential income increments arising from the sources previously enumerated had
been captured by institutional adjustment; or the costs of altering
the existing arrangements exceed those increments; and (2) there
is no change to effect any income redistribution without some change
in the economic enviroment. Equilibrium exists but pressure for
institutional innovation could be engendered by any of three types
of exogenous events:
1. Potential income from arrangemental innovation might increase because some exogenous change could lead to the emergence
of an externality where none existed before, to a restructuring of
risks, to a shift in transaction costs, or to the application of a new
technology subject to increasing returns.
2. The costs of organizing and/or operating a new institution
might change because of the invention of a new arrangemental
technology, of institutional change in the non-economic sector, or
because the price of the factors used in the new or in competing
existing institutions may change.
3. Some legal or political change might alter the economic environment and make it possible for some group to effect a redistribution or take advantage of an existing external profit opportunity.
We assume that businessmen are profit maximizers, and that entrepreneurs are as willing to take advantage of profit opportunities
arising from institutional reorganization as they are willing to ex-

<-----Page 10----->140

Lance Davis; Douglass North

ploit new markets, technologies (in the narrow sense), or changes
in relative factor prices. Thus the profit potential inherent in any of
the three types of exogenous changes would lead to attempts to predict not only the level (individual, government, or voluntary cooperative) of the new institution, but also the time that one would
expect to elapse between the emergence of the profit opportunity
and the innovation of the new (or the mutation of the old) institution.
Given the emergence of such a profit opportunity, we argue that
the primary action group considers arrangemental alternatives in
much the same fashion that a business firm considers the choice
between alternative investment decisions. Thus, we assume that the
action group formulates for each alternative a discounted stream of
net future income and selects the arrangemental alternative with the
highest positive present value.
No theory specified so loosely has any predictive value, so let us
assume that the action group's formulation takes the following form:

where :

V 	 is the discounted present value of the arrangemental innovation
Co is the cost of effecting the organization of the new arrangement
R, is the returns that the action group estimate will accrue to it
from the new arrangement in year n
Cr, is the share of the estimated costs of operating the new arrangement in year n that will be borne by the action group
Cs 	 is the estimate of the costs of getting stuck with a decision that
the members of the action group do not like. It is the product
of the dollar costs incurred by getting stuck times the probability that these "undesirable" decisions will be forced onto
them. (Hence it is assumed that the level of these costs is constant from year to year, but that assumption can be removed
without materially affecting the conclusions.)
Further we impose several empirical constraints on the precise form
of the problem. Clearly, the organizational costs are zero if the arrangement is at the individual level and positive if at the voluntary
cooperative or governmental level. At the same time Cs is zero for

<-----Page 11----->Institutional Innovation

141

both individual and voluntary cooperative arrangements, but posi.~
we
tive, if it draws on the coercive power of g ~ v e r n m e n t Finally,
assume that while revenues are expected to accrue in the near future
(in this formulation in year I), "stuck" costs are not likely to arise
until some later date.
As to the duration of the lag between profit and innovation, the
theory of technical change suggests several constraints and we have
incorporated them into our model. We assume that the lag will be
shorter the greater are the number of known alternative technologies
that may be borrowed or modified, the more solidly are economic
institutions based on the legal and political environment, the larger
the number of existing arrangements than can provide the basis for
further institutional extensions, and the greater and more certain are
the potential returns.
From this formulation and our behavioral assumption of profit
maximization we are able to deduce several predictions about the
nature and timing of arrangemental innovation. First, organizational
costs always loom large since they must be met out of present dollars, but that "stuck" costs are spread out over time and their present
value may not appear oppressive if the rate of discount is sufficiently
large. Second, only those operating costs borne by and the revenues
accruing to the primary action group are relevant to the investment
decision, and innovation is not desired if no alternative has a positive
net present value. Third, the time distribution of costs and revenues
is very important, particularly when the relevant discount rate is
high. Fourth, we expect that, if economic development brings with
it declining capital costs, new innovation to capture non-redistributive
profits will be biased against government since the "stuck costs"
delivered in time will appear larger and reduce the present value of
the governmental alternative. Finally, we expect that innovation producing larger total income will be made as soon as a profitable technology is available, but that those involving redistribution will be
made swiftly only if the profits are large or the competing groups are
not evenly balanced.
THE MODEL APPLIED

In the remainder of this paper we shall attempt to demonstrate
some of the promise and limitations of the model. Here we pick up
4 There may be positive "stuck" costs for voluntary cooperative groups if there are
costs associated with withdrawing from membership in the group.

<-----Page 12----->Lance Davis; Douglass North 

and examine, in light of the model, the arrangemental response to
three of the illustrations in the previous section.
1. In the case of the western mortgage market, there were in the
early years a few people who assessed the risks differently from the
typical investor and these few eastern capitalists began to search out
western mortgages. For these few, the search costs (since they involved sending an agent west) were very high. Once an agent was
in the field and had acquired some knowledge of potential investments, it was possibIe for him to sell his knowledge to any number
of potential investors. Given these economies of scale, it is not surprising that the information function quickly became institutionalized and with that institutionalization, the costs of search dropped
markedly. Moreover, once that institution had been established, it
was an easy step from a "broker on order" to a broker who maintained an inventory of mortgages, and another simple step from
there to a mortgage bank whose assets were a portfolio of mortgages
and who issued stocks and bonds against that portfolio. The period
of development began with the agent in the late 1860's and early
1870's and culminated with the first formal mortgage bank twenty
years later.
By the period in question, interest rates had declined sufficiently
to make mobilization through the interposition of some governmental
institution appear less attractive than some private alternative, although such government arrangements had been the "innovation of
choice" forty years before when funds were needed for the transport
network in the trans-Appalachian midwest. Moreover, the ability to
base the new banking organizations on the structure of agents supported by those eastern capitalists with low uncertainty discounts
certainly reduced organizational costs substantially and made the
voluntary cooperative alternative appear particularly attractive.
2. The realization of economies of scale is intimately connected
with the evolution of the corporation. In the early period of American
history the corporate form was associated with semi-public activities
(educational, religious, and semi-governmental activities) but with
the growing demand for large amounts of capital in transportation
enterprises the advantages of this form of organization led to its
rapid adoption. Initially, a corporate charter required legislative enactment but the growing demand gradually led to the passage of
general incorporation laws. The first such law was enacted in North
Carolina in 1795 but diffusion was slow and it was not until the

<-----Page 13----->Institutional Innovation

143

1870's that the incorporation laws of most states had been broadened
to permit limited liability and unlimited lifespan, capitalization, and
purposes.
Manufacturing enterprises were for the most part small scale in
the early nineteenth century and any advantages of the corporate
form therefore were small and outweighed by the costs of obtaining
a charter. The Boston hlanufacturing Company of Waltham, Massachusetts was a celebrated exception and its scale of operation made
the corporate form of organization preferable even though a special
charter had to be obtained. By the beginning of the second half of
the nineteenth century, technological changes were rapidly expanding the optimum size of the manufacturing firm and the expansion
led to the widespread adoption of the corporate form. There were,
however, great pressures to reduce the costs of incorporation.
For example, the petroleum refining industry in the 1850's was
characterized by something close to constant returns to scale. All
that was required to operate was a still (basically a copper boiler
and several hundred feet of tubing). Small firms had one still
and larger firms more than one, but costs per unit of output
were not a function of the size of the operation. Over the next two
decades, however, a new technology was innovated, and this technology was subject to increasing returns over a wide range of outputs. The new techniques required very heavy investment in a
sophisticated refining plant. That plant, in turn, could produce a
large volume of refined petroleum much more cheaply than under
the old technology, but the entire plant was needed (that is, it was
"indivisible") even if the output were very small. As a result, large
firms could produce much more cheaply than small, and there was
great pressure for small firms to increase their size. Most efficient
firms' sizes and the number of firms in the industry were, of course,
a function of the technology and the relevant market size.
If all firms had equal access to capital there would be no way of
predicting which firms would grow and which would die, nor is
there any particular reason to expect that reorganization would bring
increased profits. In the real world, however, capital is not equally
available to all firms. The firm's own organizational form may well
be the determining factor in the supply of capital available to it.
Since both sole proprietorships and partnerships are characterized
by limited life and unlimited liability, the supply of long-term external finance available to such firms is frequently very limited.

<-----Page 14----->144

Lance Davis; Douglass North

Finance tends to be scarce, equity finance because of the unlimited
liability attached to such investments and debt finance because the
enterprise may die (with its owner) while the capital still has a
portion of its life remaining. The latter constraint becomes more
binding the more specific is the capitaL6 The innovation of the corporation with its unlimited life and limited liability lifts the restrictions on obtaining capital and therefore allows its innovators to reap
the profits inherent in the economies of scale.
The choice of general incorporation ( a voluntary cooperative solution whose practicality rests on the ability to alter statute law) is an
interesting one. By the 1860's interest rates had declined sufficiently
that governmental alternatives appeared less attractive (some forty
years before they had, as the experience of the "mixed companies
in Pennsylvania and Virginia attest) than the competing private
forms. Still special incorporation was a possibility, but that choice
involved very large organizational costs. The model suggests that
regular small expenditures aimed at lobbying through a change to
general incorporation was a less costly solution for the small manufacturer interested in reaping the income inherent in the economies
of scale. Moreover, that route permitted even this stream of costs
to be shared by the affected firms and therefore the organization
costs need not have been borne by a single firm as would the cost
of a special charter.
The arrangement was an adaptation of an already existing institutional form, but to effect that innovation a change in property rights
(limited liability, making the corporation a legal person, and posessing unlimited lifespan) was required. The institutional instrument
was the general incorporation law. By the time the petroleum industry's technology led to a dramatic expansion in plant size, its
organizers had only to meet liberal state general incorporation laws
to realize these organizational benefits.
3. Most efforts to capture potential profits via redistribution of income are done via governmental organizational forms, and if a voluntary cooperative group is to succeed in redistributing income in its
favor, it must of necessity have some degree of coercive authority to
limit supply-an authority that almost always must rely on government fiat. The history of the American Medical Association is an ex5 If the finance is invested in capital for which there is a ready market, the problems exist but their effect is minimized. If, however, the capital has no market, the
demise of the owner may signal the default of the loan.

<-----Page 15----->Institutional Innovation

cellent example of a voluntary cooperative group acting through the
government to successfully redistribute income in its favor. The AMA
was founded in 1847 and adopted two basic policy positions:
(1) that doctors should be licensed; and ( 2 ) that schools of medicine must be accredited. State legislatures were rapidly convinced
to license the practice of medicine, but the success of the second

Medical Education and that Council in turn persuaded the Carnegie
Foundation to do a joint study of medicine in the United States.

oversupply of doctors and that there should be fewer but better
trained doctors was widely accepted by state legislatures and these
bodies in turn delegated to the AMA the task of determining what
was or was not a first class medical school. State standards for winning a license to practice medicine limited applicants to graduates
of these medical schools. The number of medical schools was reduced from 162 in 1906 to 69 in 1944, the number of medical students from 28,000 in 1904 to 14,000 in 1920. (The latter figure did
not reach the 1904 total again until the mid 1950's. ) As a result, the
number of doctors per 100,000 population dropped from 157 in 1900
to 132 in 1957. Income data for the medical profession only begins
in 1929 but even in that period the figures attest to the AMA's success. For the years 1939 through 1951 the mean income of physicians
increased 218 percent-a figure that is 42 percent more than the increase for dentists, 113 percent more than for lawyers, and 132 percent more than for managers and proprietor^.^
In terms of our model, the action group was the AMA. The institutional rearrangement required political action by state legislatures
to enact licensing requirements and to delegate licensing authority
to state boards affiliated with the AMA. The state boards were the
secondary action group and the institutional instruments employed
to effect these policies were the licensing laws and policies.

could offer exclusive benefits (that is, malpractice insurance) not
available to outsiders. From this organizational base the "passionate
minority" with specific goals was able to convince political bodies
to innovate a new institutional arrangement: industry "self-regulation."
CHANGES IN THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE MIX

We feel that our study sheds some illumination upon one irnportant question in American economic history-the changing publicprivate economic mix. While some of the sources of this change are
exogenous to our model, that is, they are engendered by changes in
the basic institutional environment, our model does suggest what
the consequences of those changes have been in terms of the participation of government in economic activity. Other sources of those
changes are the results of the process of arrangemental innovation,
and thus our model has some direct implications about the mix.
In this section we shall very briefly summarize the sources of the
basic trends, and suggest how they have affected the public-private
mix.
Through the early nineteenth century the government participated
in a wide variety of economic activities-a participation to which the
studies of Carter Goodrich, Milton Heath, the Handlins, and Louis
Hartz attest. Part of the explanation for this participation-a portion
that is exogenous to our model-lies in the general attitude towards
government participation that was inherited from the mercantilist
policies of the English, a heritage that accustomed people to such
intervention. However, a more basic and positive explanation is endogenous-despite the existence of some poor administrators, the
government "infrastructures" of the new states were well developed
relative to the rather primitive development of factor and commodity
markets. As a result, the benefits of using government to capture
some potential profits (particularly in the reduction of transactions
costs when markets were small) were typically greater than those
that could be achieved through purely voluntary organizations.
Moreover, when interest rates were high the potential costs of "getting stuck" did not appear large. The decision to let government
underwrite canal investment during the 1830's was, given the primitive state of the American capital market, a rational one and provides an excellent illustration of this point.
A dramatic transformation took place in the nineteenth century.

<-----Page 17----->Institutional Innovation 

The Constitution with its carefully constructed framework of checks
and balances designed to prevent any "faction" from redistributing
income in its favor (at least any large group from attempting a redistribution from the few to the many), the limits on suffrage and
the interpretations of the Marshall-dominated Supreme Court, all
events exogenous to our system, made efforts to redistribute income
more equally very costly. In addition, the public attitude towards
government involvement changed following the widespread default
of state government bonds in the wake of the 1839-1843 depression.
This change in the communities' utility function also almost certainly
contributed to the decline in the reliance on governmental arrangements.
The growing size of the American market in the nineteenth century was a continuous disequilibrating force that led to changes
in the public-private mix. As the market grew it created potential
profits for those who would innovate institutional arrangements to
reduce transaction costs. Given the alternative costs and revenues
these new arrangements tended to depend heavily on voluntary cooperative organizations. The development of a multitude of organizational forms designed to realize lower information costs or spread
risks characterized every facet of the factor and product markets
from the primitive auction systems used to distribute imports in the
early nineteenth century to the sophisticated futures markets in basic
agricultural commodities that had emerged by 1900.
The twentieth century has marked an equally dramatic reversal.
The basic economic environment has been altered by delegation of
government authority at both the federal and state level to commissions-a delegation that has significantly lowered the cost of influencing government policy in the behalf of organized groups; the
franchise has been extended and that extension has encouraged efforts to effect more equal income distribution; the decisions of the
Supreme Court (particularly with respect to its liberal interpretation
of the Commerce Clause) has raised the revenue from the innovation of governmental arrangement in a myriad of economic activities;
the depression of 1929-1941 changed people's basic attitudes about
the relative efficacy of the market versus government intervention;
and two world (not to mention lesser) wars increased government
influence over resource allocation and that trend has not been reversed in the subsequent period of "peace."
Related to the process of development but containing implications

for the mix has been the emergence of externalities associated with
the growth of urban agglomerations and increasing interdependency.
The economies of scale inherent in modern technology have produced
an urban society in which the divergence between private and social
costs in the area of transportation, pollution, and health has produced
pressing problems not easily resolved without the coercive authority
of government. At the same time, the specialization of function that
has accompanied growth has been a source of mutual interdependence. As a result, it has become increasingly apparent that the
policies of one group have significant welfare effects on others, and
this interweaving of destinies has also tended to increase the reliance
on government.
To summarize in more general terms, the rise of government in
the twentieth century stems from the relative increase in the "profitability" of attempts to redistribute income and from the problems
associated with excluding non-participants from the benefits or the
costs of the activities of individuals and groups in a society characterized by massive agglomeration and interdependence.
CONCLUSION

I t would be very easy to fall into the "tautological trap" and argue
that our theory offers a rationalization for all arrangemental innovation; however, we have tried to make the model operational ( a t least
in principle). In this regard we have cast all costs and revenues in
money (rather than psychic) terms, but we are the first to admit
that the existence of uncertainties and uncertainty discounts that
cannot be readily translated into money terms limits the usefulness
of our model. Moreover, it should be equally clear that we have not
been able to predict everything, and that the total picture is one of
something considerably less than universal success.
The model appears to yield results that are particularly poor:
(1) in the political arena whenever the gains from innovation are
small or when the opposing coalitions who attempt to accrue these
gains are relatively evenly balanced; ( 2 ) in the prediction of "level"
when the choice set contains not only the three "pure" solutions but
a large number of mixed (for example, partly private, partly governmental) alternatives; and ( 3 ) on the entire question of the institutional environment. There we have been forced to assume that
changes in that environment are exogenous while in fact, at Ieast a

<-----Page 19----->part of them are endogenous, and should be so considered in a more
generally formulated theory. In all three of these areas better results
await further improvements.
Despite these qualifications, we argue that this exercise has been
worthwhile. I t has focused attention on the need for some theory of
institutional change, if we are ever to have a useful theory of economic growth, and, even in its present crude form, the model has,
we feel, allowed us to take a new and productive look at certain
aspects of the American historical experience.
