CEO Dismissal in
Venture Capital-Backed
Firms: Further Evidence
From an
Agency Perspective
Garry D. Bruton

This study uses agency theory to examine CEO dismissal in venture capital-backed firms.
Prior applications of agency theory have focused on reducing managerial opportunism by
aligning the interests of manager with owner. Unlike large, mature firms, venture capitalbacked companies feature high levels of CEO stock ownership. In this environment, we find
that the primary reason for CEO dismissal is lack of agent ability, followed by good faith
disagreements between principal and agent, with managerial opportunism ranking last.
Further, we find that CEOs dismissed for opportunism owned more stock than those dismissed for other reasons.

Upper-echelons theory recognizes that executive leadership is critical in establishing a firm's performance (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1990). The firm's strategic direction
and reaction to environmental events is ultimately set by the executive leadership of the
firm (Hambrick & D'Aveni, 1992). Research on venture capital similarly recognizes the
important effects of managers on venture performance when it identifies management
ability as a critical element in the decision to fund a new venture (Tyebjee & Bruno,
1984; Elango, Fried, Hisrich, & Polonchek, 1995; Fried & Hisrich, 1994).
The significant impact of executive leadership on performance sometimes results in
venture capitalists (VCs), working through the board ofthe directors, replacing the CEO
when they are not pleased with firm performance (Rosenstein, Bruno. Bygrave, &
Taylor, 1993). Prior research has shown that it is most often strategic concerns, not
operational, that lead to CEO replacement in VC-backed firms (Bruton, Fried, & Hisrich,
1998). However, beyond this rudimentary understanding, our knowledge about dismissal
of CEOs in VC-backed firms is limited.
Agency theory is widely used to explain managerial behavior and CEO dismissal in
large mature firms. It is argued that managerial opportunism, arising from the lack of
managerial ownership, is the root cause of managerial failure. However, Walsh and
Seward (1990) argued that managerial difficulties from an agency perspective could also

to argue that agency difficulties with a manager could also include good faith disagreements between the principal and agent.
Most frequently, an agency perspective assumes managerial opportunism when considering the causes of managerial dismissal. But the relative importance of the three root
causes of dismissal has not been examined. An environment where managerial ownership is high would allow the impact of the other types of agent problems to be assessed
more accurately since managerial opportunism should be relatively weak. Additionally,
relatively small changes in ownership percentage that may affect managers' behavior m
large firms should have less of a confounding impact in firms where managers have a
relatively high ownership stake. In VC-backed firms, the ownership levels of managers
is typically high. Thus, a VC-backed firm offers an ideal environment in which to
examine the impact of agency upon CEOs.

VENTURE CAPITAL-BACKED EIRMS AND AGENCY THEORY
Agency theory recognizes that in the modem corporation, the owners of the firm
typically do not manage it (Berie & Means, 1932). For example, CEOs of the 50 largest
public companies in America own only 0.19% of their firms.' This separation of ownership and control can lead to increased agency costs (Oswald & Jahera, 1991). In
situations where there is a split in ownership and control, a divergence of objectives and
confiicts of interest may arise (Fama & Jensen, 1983). Friction will occur since each
party will seek to serve his/her own self-interests (Eisenhardt. 1989). This is referred to
as managerial opportunism.
In sharp contrast to large public companies, the stock ownership levels of the entire
top management team of VC-backed firms is typically quite high (Fried. 1999; Sahlman,
1988). In fact, high levels of management ownership are expected by the VC (Fried &
Hisrich, 1995). VC-backed firms offer the opportunity to test the efficacy of agency
theory on CEO dismissal since the impact of managerial opportunism should be less of
a dominant factor, allowing other potential causes of difficulty to more clearly be
ascertained.
While there have been prior investigations of agency theory in entrepreneurial environments (such as Michael's [1996] investigation of franchising), they are very limited
in regard to venture capital. Amit. Glosten, and Mueller (1990) used agency theory to
create a theoretical model of venture capital that stressed the issues of moral hazard
(post-investment) and adverse selection (investment decisions). Norton (1995) created a
similar theoretical explanation of venture capital allocation based on an agency theory
perspective. Cable and Shane (1997) criticized the underlying rationale used in these
prior investigations of agency and venture capital. They point out that the relationship
between entrepreneur and VC is not always a hierarchical one between unequal parties,
as assumed by agency theory. In addition, they argue that agency theory ignores the
important social relationships between the parties, and the potential for mutual gain
through cooperation. Cable and Shane argue for a broader examination of the concept of
agency when examining venture capital; specifically they argue for the use of a Prisoner's Dilemma approach where "the agency perspective is actually a subset of the broader
explanation" (1997, p. 146).
Other researchers examining topics outside of venture capital have also recognized
the need to expand beyond managerial opportunism when examining agency problems.
Walsh and Seward (1990, p. 434) point out that "the problem of agency initially was

<-----Page 2----->thought to disappear when a manager was made an owner. A management ownership
stake was thought to align the potentially divergent interests of outside shareholders and
management." While not disagreeing with the value of interest alignment, they argue that
the principaL/agent problem is not just a problem of management opportunism. They
suggest that agency problems may also arise from a lack of agent ability, hence the
potential benefit from CEO dismissal.
Sapienza and Gupta (1994) agree with Walsh and Se ward's (1990) broadened view
of the agency problem. However, they go further by adding a third type of agency
problemâ€”good faith disagreements between principal and agent as to the proper direction of the agent's efforts. They argue:
It is our position that even if there were no question about managers' willingness to
expend effort to maximize profits, the issue ofthe direction of effort would still exist.
In contexts such as new ventures, in which task uncertainty is very high, signals
regarding the best course of action are generally very weak. In such a situation, even
if a principal and an agent are equally committed to the maximization of shareholder
wealth, they might have recurring disagreements regarding how to prioritize operating goals. From the VC's perspective, an agency problem arises because such
disagreements raise the question of whether the CEO is pursuing the best course of
action. . . . [A]s long as both the VC and the CEO have major financial stakes in the
venture and as long as there exists a possibility that neither side will always be right
or always be wrong, disagreements over the direction of effort will create agency
problems for the venture capitalist. (Sapienza & Gupta, 1994, p. 1620)
Thus, there may be potential agent problems other than opportunism. To date, two
principal problems have been identified: lack of managerial ability and good faith disagreements. However, empirical support for these problems is limited. If these problems
exist, they should be apparent in VC-backed firms since the opportunism problem should
be relatively weak. Since a clear breakdown in the principal/agent relationship occurs
when a CEO is dismissed, it is hypothsized that:
HI: CEO dismissal in VC-backed firms is negatively related to the VC's perception
of the CEO's managerial ability.
H2: CEO dismissal in VC-backed firms is positively related to the VC's perception
ofthe degree of good faith disagreement between the VC and the CEO as to the
proper direction of the CEO's efforts.

METHODOLOGY
A survey of 383 VCs was conducted. Initially, 51 surveys were returned. All nonrespondents were then sent another survey instrument that produced an additional 17
responses for a total of 68 surveys. Utilizing common survey non-response bias techniques, two checks of non-response bias were made. Armstrong and Overton (1977)
demonstrated that in a two-stage mailing the second-stage respondents are similar to
non-respondents since they require an additional stimulus to respond. Thus, a comparison was made between the two waves of surveys. We found no significant differences,
thus demonstrating that the respondents and non-respondents were similar.
Additionally, specific characteristics of respondents and non-respondents were compared. Prior research has shown that VC behavior may vary based on the amount of time
he/she spends with the portfolio company, the amount of capital invested, and the
portfolio company's developmental stage (Elango, Fried, Hisrich, & Polonchek, 1995).

<-----Page 3----->Therefore, respondents were compared against a sample of non-respondents on these
variables. No significant differences were observed.
The response rate of 18% is consistent with the response rate of other research on
venture capitalists (MacMillan, Kulow, & Khoylian, 1988). VC firms typically have a
flat structure with the firm employing only the VCs and secretarial support. This flat
organizational structure and the policy of many firms not to participate in survey research
(Pearce & Zahra, 1991) constrains the response rate.
The VCs were eliminated from the study if they had not been involved in a CEO
dismissal in the previous three years. This requirement, coupled with some cases of
missing data, led to the elimination of 17 respondents, resulting in a final sample of 51
firms.
To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, respondents to the survey were asked to identify the
principal reasons for the CEO"s replacement from a list of three potential choices: 1) the
CEO maximized his/her own interests; 2) the CEO's view of what was best for the firm
differed from that of the board; and 3) the CEO had good ideas but could not accomplish
them. If opportunism problems associated with agency are the principal cause of the
CEO"s difficulties, answer 1 should be the dominant response. However, if it is other
agency problems, then answers 2 or 3 would be expected to predominate.
To further explore the issue of CEO replacement, we also collected data on CEO
stock ownership (measured as a percentage of stock owned on a fully diluted basis) and
firm performance. We asked the respondents to rate the impact of the new CEO on
overall firm performance. A subjective measure was deemed appropriate because all of
the firms were privately held, and many were young firms whose financial income may
not accurately reflect the strategic position of the firm. Such subjective respondent
evaluations of performance have been shown to be highly correlated with objective
financial performance measures (Brush & VanderWerf, 1992; Dess & Robinson, 1984).
A 7-point Likert-type scale was utilized where 7 equaled a strong positive impact and 1
was a strong negative impact.

RESULTS
Table 1 contains basic descriptive statistics for key variables in the study. There was
no significant correlation between the variables tested. CEOs in our sample on average
owned 9.12% of their companies. This is radically different from large public companies.
In examining the data for Hypotheses 1 and 2, only 16% of the VCs cited CEOs
maximizing their own benefit as the reason they were dismissed (Table 2). The research
found that 84% of the removals were related to the other agency problems. Examining
these percentages indicates that both Hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported. There was a
clear relationship between reason dismissed and the amount of stock owned by the CEO
(Table 3). CEOs fired for opportunism owned a much larger share of firm stock than
those dismissed for other reasons.
While not part of our formal hypotheses, we found that the performance impact of
the new CEO replacement was 6.12 on a 7-point scale. Additionally, an examination of
2. Utilizing a methodology similar to McDougall and Robinson (1990), the researchers examined the
non-respondents to the survey. Surveying 10% of non-respondent, we were able to contact 19 VCs or their
assistants. It was found that 10 (53%) of these VCs had a general policy of not responding or rarely
responding to surveys. This percentage is greater than that found by Pearce and Zahra (1991) when
examining corporate officers. The fiatter nature of a typical VC organization likely explains this greater
percentage. In Pearce and Zahra's (1991) research, they automatically removed this percentage from the total
number of potential respondents. If those individuals who do not respond to surveys are eliminated, we
obtained 32% of potential respondents.

section, these results raise interesting questions for future research.

DISCUSSION
Given the predominant research focus on organizations with minimal managerial
ownership, it is not surprising that the previous theoretical focus has been on agency
problems that arise as a result of managerial opportunism. Once the interests of principal
and agent are more closely aligned, the literature implies that agency problems disappear. However, as Sapienza and Gupta (1994) point out, there are other potential agency
problems that may still affect firms with high managerial ownership levels. Only \69c of
the dismissals in our study were related to opportunism. Actually, this probably overstates the occurrence of opportunism in VC settings since only firms who dismissed
CEOs were included in the study.
The findings for Hypotheses 1 and 2 indicate that a lack of agent ability may be a
much greater agency cost than opportunism. Research applications of agency theory

often implicitly assume that agents are all equally qualified. However, the literature on
impact of executive leadership on firm performance would discount this approach (Hambrick & Mason, 1984; Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1990). The evidence presented here
reconfirms this view of the impact of agent ability. It was the lack of ability that
principally led to CEO dismissal. Thus, future research should expand the investigation
of the impact of CEO quality and ability on the firm.
Given agency theory's historical concern over managerial opportunism where there
is a split between management and ownership, it is interesting to note that the VC did
not find those CEOs with lower levels of ownership to be more opportunistic (Table 3).
Indeed, the opportunistic CEOs had a much higher level of ownership. It is possible that
as ownership by CEOs grows to very high levels, the CEOs grow more risk adverse and
avoid those high opportunity-seeking behaviors that investors such as VCs prefer (Eisenhardt, 1989). ^
This finding is also consistent with finance research on large firms that has found
high levels of management stock ownership leading to negative firm performance (McConnell & Servaes, 1990: Morck, Schleifer, & Vishny, 1988). Morck, Schleifer, and
Vishny (1988) found that the relationship turned negative at 5%\ while McConnell and
Servaes (1990) found the relationship changing from positive to negative at 25% (these
studies used the combined stock ownership of all board members and senior managers,
whereas we used CEO ownership). While not explicitly based on agency theory, these
finance studies use an entrenchment logic: with "effective control the manager may
indulge his preference for non-value maximizing behavior" (Morck et al., 1988, p. 294).
VCs may find similar behavior. At very high levels of ownership the CEO may focus less
on maximizing financial return, which is the VC's concern, and more on other actions
that the CEO finds more satisfying.
Together these studies suggest a curvilinear relationship between ownership and
performance. This possibility should be seriously examined. Which should perform
better, a firm with 5% CEO ownership or one with 100% CEO ownership? While not
addressed in this study, this question is of great importance in entrepreneurial environments. A 100% CEO ownership deprives a firm of the potential for mutually beneficial
cooperation with the VC (Cable & Shane, 1997). In addition to cash, the VC may provide
a variety of other beneficial inputs, including operating services, network access, image,
moral support, general business knowledge, and discipline (Fried & Hisrich, 1995). The
value of these inputs is perhaps best illustrated by Bill Gates's decision in 1980 to seek
74

counsel (Wilson, 1985).
The negative relationship between the "old" CEO's ownership and the impact of the
new CEO on perfonnance also merits further investigation. Coupled with the fact that
dismissed CEOs with little ownership were the ones seen as being incompetent and those
with high ownership opportunistic, this relationship suggests that VCs were more disappointed in the replacements made for reasons of opportunism. If so, the difficulty may
not lie with the replacement CEO but with the situation in which the replacement CEO
is placed.
We found that VCs think dismissal has a highly favorable impact on performance.
But, as it could be expected that the VC would experience cognitive dissonance in
replacing the CEO, so they are likely to see performance improvement to justify their
removal of the CEO. This limits our ability to determine the relationship between
dismissal and firm performance.
Future research should seek to overcome the shortcomings of this study. Our interpretation of the VC/CEO relationship is limited by our focus on dismissed CEOs. Future
research should examine the relationship in less draconian settings. Additionally, richer
measures of VC/CEO interaction and CEO performance would provide additional insight. Finally, the impact of other interested parties, e.g. limited partners, should also be
explored. Cable and Shane's call for a N-person Prisoner's Dilemma approach may
prove particularly beneficial.

CONCLUSION
VCs are often criticized for their dismissal of CEOs. The evidence here shows that
these dismissals relate principally to the ability of the CEO. The results confirm the
previous emphasis that has been placed on funding those ventures where strong management teams are present. Both the time spent in the pre-investment investigation of the
abilities of CEOs and the post-investment time spent monitoring CEO performance may
be expensive to the VC, but insuring a quality CEO is critical.
The findings presented here have significant implications for entrepreneurial businesses where high CEO ownership levels are the norm, not the exception. We have
shown that there are significant agency problems besides managerial opportunism. Our
purpose here is not to question the potential for management opportunism or the ability
of firms to deal with this by aligning the interests of owners and managers. One reason
for studying agency theory in VC-backed firms was that VCs are strong believers in
these aspects of agency theory. However, their experiences with agents show that the
agency problem goes beyond managerial opportunism.
