<-----Page 2----->What is Competitiveness?

A nation or region is competitive to the extent that firms operating there are able to
compete successfully in the regional and global economy while maintaining or
improving wages and living standards for the average citizen

• Competitiveness depends on the long-run productivity and efficiency of a
location as a place to do business
- The productivity of existing firms and workers
- The ability to achieve high participation of citizens in the workforce
• Competitiveness is not:
- Low wages
- A weak currency
- Jobs per se

<-----Page 3----->What Determines Competitiveness?

Endowments

• Endowments, including natural resources, geographical location, population, and land area, create a

foundation for prosperity, but true prosperity arises from productivity in the use of endowments

Endowments

• Macroeconomic competitiveness sets the economy-wide context for productivity to emerge, but is not

sufficient to ensure productivity
• Endowments, including natural resources, geographical location, population, and land area, create a

foundation for prosperity, but true prosperity arises from productivity in the use of endowments

Endowments
• Productivity ultimately depends on improving the microeconomic capability of the economy and the

sophistication of local competition revealed at the level of firms, clusters, and regions
• Macroeconomic competitiveness sets the economy-wide context for productivity to emerge, but is not
sufficient to ensure productivity
• Endowments, including natural resources, geographical location, population, and land area, create a

foundation for prosperity, but true prosperity arises from productivity in the use of endowments

<-----Page 9----->Regions and Competitiveness
• Economic performance varies significantly across sub-national regions
(e.g., provinces, states, metropolitan areas)
• Many essential levers of competitiveness reside at the regional level
• Regions specialize in different sets of clusters

• Regions are a crucial unit in competitiveness

• Each region needs its own distinctive strategy and action agenda
•

The presence of a region’s clusters in neighboring regions is a driver of performance. Economic
performance is not a zero-sum competition with one’s neighbors.

<-----Page 16----->Clusters and Innovation

• Clusters increase productivity and operational efficiency
• Clusters stimulate and enable innovations
• Clusters facilitate commercialization and new business formation

• Clusters reflect the fundamental importance to productivity and
innovation of linkages and spill-overs across firms and associated
institutions

20140311 – Temple University Competitiveness Presentation

Copyright 2014 © Professor Michael E. Porter

<-----Page 17----->Strong Clusters Drive Regional Performance
Research Findings
• Presence of strong clusters
(based on employment and
innvation)

• Job growth

• Breadth of industries within each
cluster

• Higher patenting rates

• Higher wages

• Greater new business
formation, growth and survival

• Strength in related clusters

• New regional industries

• Presence of a region’s clusters in
neighboring regions

• The initial employment and patenting strength of a cluster each has a separate
positive effect on the employment and patenting growth of the constituent industries

• Multiple types of externalities arise among firms participating in clusters
(knowledge, skills, input-output linkages, and others)
• Build on the region’s existing and emerging clusters rather than chase hot fields
• Economic diversification usually occurs within clusters and across related clusters

<-----Page 42----->Summary: Cluster Performance
• Education and Knowledge Creation is the cornerstone of the region
– Highly inter-related to other strong clusters in the region
– Important source of employment and business creation

• Other growing clusters: Business Services, Aerospace Vehicles and Defense,
IT and Analytical Instruments, Transportation and Logistics, and Performing Arts
• Financial Services and Insurance Services:
- Wages remain high, but slow employment recovery

• Challenges in Biopharmaceuticals:
– Strong cluster, but 50% of employment lost relative to 2006
– Pharmaceutical Preparations subcluster hit hardest

– The overall strength in the Education and Knowledge Creation cluster masks an
employment decline in the critical Biotech Research area

• Opportunities to exploit synergies among strong neighboring clusters:
E.g., in Biopharmaceuticals and in Education and Knowledge Creation

2. Pursue economic diversification within clusters and across
related clusters
3. Create a private sector-led cluster upgrading program with
matching support for participating private sector cluster
organizations
• Government should listen and remove obstacles to cluster
improvement
4. Align other city economic policies and programs with clusters

region given its location, legacy, existing strengths, and
potential strengths?
– What unique value as a business location?
– For what types of activities and clusters?

Define the Value Proposition

Achieve and Maintain
Parity with Peers

Develop Unique Strengths
• What elements of the business
environment can be unique strengths
relative to peers/neighbors?
• What existing and emerging clusters
represent local strengths?

• What weaknesses must be addressed to
remove key constraints and achieve
parity with peer locations?

• Economic strategy requires setting priorities and moving beyond long lists of
separate recommendations.

• Compete for every plant

• Reinforce areas of specialization
and emerging cluster strength

• Offer generalized tax breaks

• Provide support for training,
infrastructure, and institutions with
enduring benefits

• Provide subsidies to lower / offset
business costs

• Improve the efficiency of doing
business

• Every city and sub-region for itself

• Harness efficiencies and coordinate
across jurisdictions

• Government drives investment

<-----Page 51----->Summary
• The goal of economic strategy is to enhance productivity. This is the only way
to create jobs, rising wages, and wealth in the long run
• Improving productivity and innovation must be the guiding principles for
every city policy choice
• Improving productivity often does not require new public resources, but using
existing resources better
• Improving productivity demands that government leaders mobilize the private
sector, not rely on government alone
• Economic strategy is non-partisan and about getting results

Data and Tools
• The U.S. Cluster Mapping Project is a joint initiative between the U.S. Department of
Commerce, Economic Development Administration and Harvard’s Institute for Strategy
and Competitiveness
• The goal of the project is to improve U.S. competitiveness based on a bottom-up, regional
perspective on economic development, and to support evidence-based decision making
and thought leadership on cluster-driven economic policies.
• US Cluster Mapping Project website will launch in late May/early June 2014. This highly
optimized, modern website will provide access to:
• Actionable cluster and regional data reflecting the state of today’s economy
• User contributed repository of cluster initiatives, studies, and news
• Community platform and registry for organizations
• The research is driven primarily by Harvard, MIT and Temple. Key research updates
include improved cluster definitions:
• Cluster categories are groups of related industries based on co-location patterns
across regions, input-output links and skill links
• Clustering methodology: Delgado, Porter and Stern (2013), Porter (2003)

<-----Page 53----->U.S. Cluster Mapping Project: Impact on Policymaking
• By developing policy guides and policy and impact
studies (available on www.clustermapping.us), the U.S.
Cluster Mapping Project provides new insights on the role
of clusters in driving regional economic outcomes. These
reports provide:
− Measures for evaluating the impact of cluster
initiatives.
− Best practices for cluster-driven economic
development.
− Examples of how clusters have been used as a tool
for policy action.
− Lessons learned on how clusters have been used to
improve economic growth by creating networks of
organizations.

b. Perform in the U.S. those activities that can thrive here
2. Tap opportunities to build the commons and benefit the business
a. Improve skills
b. Upgrade supporting industries and the U.S. supply chain
c. Support innovation and entrepreneurship

d. Bolster cluster and regional strength
3. Stop narrowly self-interested actions that undermine the commons,

<-----Page 67----->Employment and Innovation Speciaization:
Dual Drivers of Cluster Performance

• Specialization in strong clusters
based on employment

• Job growth of the industries
within the cluster

and

• Patenting growth of the
industries within the cluster

• Specialization in strong clusters
based on innovation

• Creation of new industries
within the cluster

• The initial employment and patenting strength of a cluster each has a separate
positive effect on the employment and patenting growth of the constituent industries
• This suggests that multiple types of externalities arise among firms participating in
clusters (knowledge, skills, input-output linkages, and others)
•

Co-location of production and innovation matters
