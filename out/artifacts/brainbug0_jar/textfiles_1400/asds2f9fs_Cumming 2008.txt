Using a sample of European venture capital (VC) investments, I study the relation between
VC contracts and exits. The data indicate that ex ante, stronger VC control rights increase
the likelihood that an entrepreneurial firm will exit by an acquisition, rather than through
a write-off or an IPO. My findings are robust to controls for a variety of factors, including
endogeneity and cases in which the VC preplans the exit at the time of contract choice. My
findings are consistent with control-based theories of financial contracting, such as Aghion
and Bolton (1992). (JEL G24, G32, G33, G34)

Venture capital (VC) financial contracts separately allocate cash flow and control rights (Gompers 1998; Hart 2001; Kaplan and Strömberg 2003). In these
contracts, the control rights might include the right to replace the CEO, among
various other specific veto and control rights. Because entrepreneurs are likely
to enjoy the private benefits of being the CEO of a publicly listed firm (Berglöf
1994; Black and Gilson 1998; Bascha and Walz 2001; Hellmann 2006), even
when an acquisition is financially superior to an IPO, an entrepreneur might
prefer the IPO because of the private benefits. Therefore, the structure of entrepreneurial private benefits leads to two empirical predictions. First, if a
venture is less promising and/or the likelihood of a conflict in exit choice
is high, then in exchange for getting the venture financed, venture capitalists (VCs) will receive more control rights. Second, strong VC control should
be associated with a greater probability of an acquisition. In this article I
address the first prediction by controlling for the endogeneity of contracts

vis-à-vis exits. I focus on the second empirical prediction through empirical
testing.
In this article I use a new data set to produce results that relate the characteristics of VC contracts to the means by which a VC exits. The VC IPOand-acquisition transactions span the years 1996–2005 and eleven European
countries (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,
Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Switzerland). The data include
detailed and confidential information on 223 investments. Of these investments,
there are 187 actual dispositions (32 IPOs, 74 acquisitions, 17 buybacks, and
64 write-offs) and 36 investments that had not exited by December 2005, at the
time of this study. In ascertaining the role of VC control rights in an IPO or
acquisition, I control for a number of potentially relevant factors, including investor characteristics, entrepreneurial firm characteristics, transaction-specific
characteristics, market sentiment, and institutional variables.
My results, which are robust and economically and statistically significant,
indicate that strong VC control rights are associated with a higher probability of
acquisitions and a lower probability of IPOs and write-offs. The data indicate
that VC board control and the right to replace the founding entrepreneur as
CEO are associated with a 30% greater likelihood of an acquisition. Also, the
probability of an acquisition exit is higher if the VC uses other control rights.
I show that a VC’s use of common equity is associated with weak VC control
rights, in contrast to convertible debt or convertible preferred equity. I find that
this use of common equity is associated with a 12% greater likelihood of an
IPO. Write-offs are approximately 30% less likely when VCs use specific veto
and control rights, including the right to replace the founding entrepreneur as
CEO. My empirical specifications show that my results are robust to controls
for endogeneity of contracts vis-à-vis exits. The unique data also enable me
to show, among a wide range of other robustness checks, robustness to the
exclusion of cases in which the investor had a clear exit objective at the time
of contract.
This article is organized as follows. Section 1 develops testable hypotheses in
the context of prior research. Section 2 summarizes and explains the variables
used to test the theory. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 provides multivariate empirical tests with a number of robustness checks. Section 5 concludes
the article.
1. Hypotheses
In the literature, related work has well established that VCs contribute significantly to innovation and economic growth (Gompers and Lerner 1999, 2001a,
2001b; Kortum and Lerner 2000; Lerner 2002; Keuschnigg and Nielsen 2003;
Gompers, Lerner, and Desai 2003; Gompers, Lerner, and Scharfstein 2005).
The success of VC-backed companies has been attributed to the certification
and the professional governance provided by VCs (Baker and Gompers 2003;

1948

<-----Page 2----->Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance

Hochberg 2005). Thus, VCs play an important role in the going-public process, and VC-backed IPOs tend to perform better than non-VC-backed IPOs.
In recent years, research such as Sahlman (1990); Gompers (1998); Kaplan and
Strömberg (2003, 2004); Cumming (2005); and Cumming and Johan (2007b,
2007c) has shown that good VC governance is facilitated by strong VC contracts, and that the allocation of control rights between VCs and entrepreneurs is
consistent with the incomplete contracting theory of Aghion and Bolton (1992).
However, with the exception of Lerner’s (1995) paper relating board rights to
executive turnover, no empirical study has actually tied investor control rights
to investment outcomes.1 This article provides such a link by examining VC
control rights in relation to the acquisition-versus-IPO choice.
1.1 VC control rights
Aghion and Bolton (1992) analyze the contracting problem associated with the
entrepreneur who derives private benefits (as distinct from monetary benefits
from the venture) from running the firm. Obviously, such private benefits cannot be transferred or pledged to investors. Aghion and Bolton show that any
action that maximizes monetary benefits does not necessarily maximize private benefits, and might be different from the first-best action that maximizes
total surplus. Hence, if the entrepreneur has control and has pledged monetary
benefits to investors, he or she has an incentive to act so as to maximize private
benefits. If investors have control, then they will try to maximize monetary benefits. Since investors have deep pockets, they can always bribe the entrepreneur
into taking the efficient action; however, the opposite is not true. As a result,
the entrepreneur’s control is always ex post efficient, but investor control can
lead to ex post inefficiencies. Ex ante control might have to be transferred
to investors so that they can break even, especially in ventures for which the
expected monetary benefits are relatively low.
In the VC setting, Berglöf (1994); Black and Gilson (1998); Bascha and
Walz (2001); Hellmann (2006); De Bettignies (2008); and others hypothesize
that entrepreneurs’ private benefits are higher when the firm is taken public
compared to when it is acquired (see Petty, Martin, and Kensinger 1999 for
case studies). VC control rights are relevant in the acquisition-versus-IPO exit
decision because of the private benefits that the entrepreneur enjoys, which
might go beyond the financial rewards he or she obtains from the entrepreneurial
venture. Entrepreneurs are likely to obtain private benefits in an IPO through
the gain in reputation associated with being the CEO of a publicly listed firm.
In contrast, VCs are not likely to enjoy private benefits. VCs are less actively
involved in an investee firm that has been taken public, and they exit within
six months to two years, and/or they transfer their shares to their institutional
limited partners (Gompers and Lerner 1999). In an acquisition exit, both the VC

Lerner (1995) studies CEO replacement, not exit outcomes. For legal scholarship on contracts and VC exits, see
Smith (2005) and Broughman and Fried (2007).

1949

<-----Page 3----->The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008

and the entrepreneur sell their shares to the acquiring firm and the entrepreneur
is no longer the CEO. Thus, the scope of an entrepreneur’s private benefits in
an acquisition exit is likely to be smaller than if the firm had exited through an
IPO.
Situations in which entrepreneurs enjoy private benefits lead me to make
two empirical hypotheses. First, in the original contract, higher NPV ventures
will be associated with a higher degree of entrepreneur control, since investors
will likely break even despite not having control. This result has been tested
in previous VC contracting studies (Kaplan and Strömberg 2003; Cumming
2005; Cumming and Johan 2007c). When the venture is extremely promising,
VCs will seek and receive fewer control rights. If the venture is less valuable
to begin with, and/or the likelihood of a conflict in exit choice is higher, then
the VC will seek and receive more control rights, which the entrepreneur will
grant in order to get the venture financed. I address this issue in this article by
controlling for the endogeneity of contracts vis-à-vis exits.
Second, those ventures in which the VCs are in control are likelier to result
in actions, i.e., acquisitions, that hurt the entrepreneur’s private benefits rather
than ventures in which the entrepreneur is in control (Fried and Ganor 2006). In
an acquisition exit, the entrepreneur is, in effect, ousted as the CEO of the firm.
Entrepreneurs most often find this permanent removal from their firms to be an
emotionally upsetting event. Some entrepreneurs even describe it as equivalent
to the breakdown of a marriage (Petty, Martin, and Kensinger 1999), which
explains why many entrepreneurs are reluctant to agree to an acquisition exit.
VCs with stronger control rights are better able to force the entrepreneur to
agree to an acquisition. Therefore, in my second hypothesis I predict a positive
association between VC control rights and the likelihood of acquisition. This
hypothesis is the central prediction that is tested in this article.
There are offsetting advantages to assigning rights to the VC that result
from the entrepreneur’s informational advantage over the VC in the dayto-day operations of the enterprise. Whenever a manager assigns rights to
agents who are within an organization but who are not in a position to have
the best information, the manager incurs an efficiency cost. Allocating control rights trades off between the benefit of enhanced credibility in the market that the firm gains by assigning the rights to the VC, and the benefit to
the VC of using the entrepreneur’s superior information, by assigning rights
to the entrepreneur. An exit conflict makes it harder for the VC to break
even, thus necessitating the transfer of control to the VC, even though it is
inefficient.
Weak VC control rights might be associated with a greater probability of
either an IPO or a write-off exit. If a successful entrepreneurial firm is ready
for an exit during a robust IPO market, then a conflict of interest in exit choice
between a VC and the entrepreneur is unlikely. An IPO is most likely to
result, regardless of VC control rights. However, for problematic ventures in
which VCs have weak control rights and cannot bring about needed managerial

1950

<-----Page 4----->Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance

decisions or changes in the entrepreneurial firm (for example, replacing the
founding entrepreneur as CEO, or making control decisions regarding asset
purchases and sales), there is a greater probability that the lack of VC control
will lead to less VC assistance, which will produce a higher likelihood of a writeoff. This latter prediction is consistent with the empirical work of Cumming
and Walz (2004); Hege, Palomino, and Schwienbacher (2003); Kaplan and
Strömberg (2004); Kaplan, Martel, and Strömberg (2007); and Nikoskelainen
and Wright (2007).
A related prediction is that if a VC uses strong control rights (e.g., in a
world in which some investors make mistakes in contracting), doing so will
improve the entrepreneurial firm’s governance and increase the likelihood of
better performance. Better performance could lead to a higher likelihood of
a successful exit, whether by IPO or acquisition, and a lower likelihood of a
complete write-off.
One of the most important empirical challenges in studying contract choices
in conjunction with exit outcomes is accounting for endogeneity. My new data
set has information on whether the VC contracts are designed with a primary
view toward an IPO or acquisition prior to signing the first-round investment. I
test for robustness to the inclusion or exclusion of these preplanned exits, and
to situations in which the VC has a clear exit strategy, in terms of an IPO or
acquisition, at the time of first investment. I also use other robustness checks,
such as the use of instrumental variables.
Nevertheless, other factors might explain the relation between control rights
and exit outcomes. More highly skilled and experienced entrepreneurs might
be able to negotiate control rights away from the VC, and could be more
likely to go public. In that case, there is no direct causal link from contracts to
exits. Instead, entrepreneurial quality independently drives contracts and exits.
I control for entrepreneurial quality at the time of VC investment by using a
variable that measures the investor’s ranking of the entrepreneur’s experience
and ability.
1.2 Other factors relevant to the choice between IPOs and acquisitions
Prior theoretical work identifies a number of factors that could affect IPOs
versus acquisitions2 —for instance, VC characteristics. VCs can take on two
roles in exit outcomes: they can add value through active assistance provided to
the entrepreneurial firm3 and they can certify the quality of the entrepreneurial
firm, so that information asymmetries between them and the new owners are

Walz (forthcoming).

1951

<-----Page 5----->The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008

lower than they otherwise would have been at the time of exit.4 Both of these
roles are consistent with the view that higher quality and more reputable VCs
facilitate IPO exits more often. My empirical tests use proxies for VC quality
and value added. My tests also control for captive VCs, which I define as funds
that are part of a larger corporation or bank. Captive VCs might have nonfinancial strategic motives for wanting an acquisition rather than an IPO (Gompers
and Lerner 1999; Hellmann 2002; Riyanto and Schwienbacher 2006).
Several entrepreneurial firm characteristics, such as the size of a firm’s assets
which for IPOs must meet minimum listing requirements and the primary
industry in which it operates, can also affect the choice of an IPO rather than
an acquisition. In addition, because IPOs and acquisitions generate different
proceeds in the sale of the firm, an entrepreneurial firm’s growth potential and
capital needs could be relevant for the choice between an IPO and an acquisition.
Firms in industries with high market/book ratios have greater growth options
and thus could be more likely to go public (Gompers and Lerner 1999).
Market conditions and regulations also play an important role in VC exit
outcomes. IPO markets are subject to massive swings (Ritter 1984). I control
for the returns in the public market by using the country-specific Morgan
Stanley Capital International (MSCI) data for various periods in the year prior
to exit. I also use investment-exit-year dummy variables; country differences,
which I examine through the use of a variable for legality (La Porta et al. 1998;
Berkowitz, Pistor, and Richard 2003); stock market capitalization; and country
dummy variables. I expect countries with larger stock markets to have more
IPOs than acquisitions (Black and Gilson 1998). Legal certainty and investor
protection also are more valuable in the context of an IPO, because information
asymmetry is more pronounced for a disparate group of new shareholders in
an IPO than for new owners in an acquisition. Thus, the cost of going public
(e.g., in terms of underpricing) is lower among countries with more legal
certainty and protection (Shleifer and Wolfenzon 2002; Cumming, Fleming,
and Schwienbacher 2006).
2. Variables in the Econometric Speciﬁcations
Table 1 displays the primary variables used in my empirical analyses. There are
five main categories of variables: VC control rights, investor characteristics,
investee characteristics, market conditions, and legal and institutional factors.
The security of choice in the United States is typically convertible preferred
equity (Gompers 1998; Kaplan and Strömberg 2003), but outside the United
States, many countries use a wide range of securities (Lerner and Schoar 2005;
Kaplan, Martel, and Strömberg 2007; Cumming 2005). In addition to voting and
board rights, commonly allocated rights in VC contracts that are particularly

Definition

A dummy variable equal to 1 if the fund is not a captive fund (a limited
partnership). I define a captive fund as one that is affiliated with a bank or
corporation. Separate variables to distinguish corporate VCs and
bank-affiliated VCs are also used as robustness checks
The real (thousands of =C2003) total amount of capital for all affiliated funds
that are part of the investor’s organization
The real (thousands of =C2003) total amount of capital for the specific fund
within the investor’s organization that provided data for this study

A dummy variable equal to 1 if the entrepreneurial firm was an early- or
expansion-stage transaction at the time of investment of the respondent
VC fund, and 0 if the firm was a late- or buyout-stage firm. I do not use
more specific categories because the unit of observation is the
entrepreneurial firm, not the transaction round where more than one round
is provided by the investor, and because firms may progress from one
stage to the next. There are also differences in definitions of investment
stages across countries. Alternative variables that separate out the early(69 companies), expansion- (82 companies), late- (32 companies), and
buyout-stage (40 companies) are used as robustness checks
A dummy variable equal to 1 when the entrepreneurial firm is in a different
country from the investor at the time of first VC investment
This is a subjective ranking provided by the respondent investor about the
entrepreneur’s quality, ability, and experience, and intended for the date of
investment. The investor provided the ranking during the initial data
collection in 2002 and follow-up interviews, not at the time of actual
investment. Therefore, it is a proxy, since the investors were asked to rank
the entrepreneur’s ability going back to the time of initial investment. The
ranking is on a scale of 1–10. An alternative variable equal to 1 for ranks
greater than 7 is used as a robustness check
The industry market/book ratio for the industry in which the entrepreneurial
firm operates at the time of exit. I suppress the dummy variables for
specific industries (e.g., Medical/Biotech, Computers/Electronic, Internet/
Communications, and nontech industries) for reasons of collinearity
A dummy variable equal to 1 for common equity investments. I exclude
dummy variables for other securities (convertible preferred equity, or
mixes of debt or preferred and common equity) for reasons of collinearity.
Special control rights, veto rights, contingencies, board seats, etc.,
associated with the investment are considered separately
A dummy variable equal to 1 if the investor(s) has the right to replace the
CEO. This right is typically not a contractual right per se, but effectively a
right in the hands of the investor by virtue of the voting power provided
via the investor’s shares in the firm and/or board seats. This is not my
interpretation of the contracts. The investors themselves provided me with
the information on whether or not the investor had such power
A dummy variable equal to 1 if the VC investor(s) have a majority of the
board seats at the investee firm
A dummy variable equal to 1 if the VC investor(s) have a majority of the
voting rights at the investee firm
A dummy variable equal to 1 if the VC investor(s) have a drag-along right
that obligates the entrepreneur to sell shares along with the offer that the
VC initiates
A dummy variable equal to 1 if the VC investor(s) have a redemption right
that enables the VC to sell their shares back to the entrepreneur at
prespecified terms
A dummy variable equal to 1 if the VC investor(s) have an antidilution right
that entitles the investors to additional shares to maintain their ownership

entrepreneurial firm, not the investment round, as the unit of observation, and base contract terms on the initial
investment of the respondent VC investor.

1954

<-----Page 8----->Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance

important in the IPO-versus-acquisition decision (Kaplan and Strömberg 2003;
Hellmann 2006) include a drag-along right, in which the VC has the right to
force the entrepreneur to sell at the same terms to a third party; a redemption
right, which gives the VC the right to sell interest in the firm back to the
entrepreneur at prespecified terms and after a specific point in time, which is
typically three years after the initial investment; and an antidilution right that
protects the VC against future financings at lower than the protected valuation.
Other rights include a right of first refusal in a sale, i.e., the VC must be offered
sale terms that are at least as good as, and in advance of, those offered to a third
party; a co-sale right, which allows the VC to sell to a third party on the same
terms as the third party offers the entrepreneur; and a protection right against
new issues. There are also veto rights over asset sales, asset purchases, changes
in control, issuances of equity, and many other decisions. In some cases, the
VCs have the right to replace the founding entrepreneur as CEO. I do not expect
all of the various control rights to have an equal effect on exit outcomes.
Perhaps closest to the notion of entrepreneurial control in incomplete contracting theories is the right to replace the CEO. That is, as a residual control
right, it gives the investors the right to take this particular action. Investors can
also force an acquisition through other residual control rights, such as if they
control a majority of the board, a majority of the votes, or whether there are
other terms in the contract that give the VCs the power to force an exit, for
example, by using a redemption right or a drag-along clause. A redemption
right can be used to force an acquisition if it is difficult or undesirable for the
entrepreneur to repurchase the VC’s interest. An antidilution right gives VCs
more bargaining power in subsequent financing rounds, and if the firm needs
further financing, this right is likely to lead to a larger dilution of entrepreneurial
control. A right to veto asset sales, purchases, and new equity issues could be
used as a threat in negotiations, and might indirectly affect the exit outcome,
although it is less clear that such a right could be used to force an acquisition
or buyback.
Other rights play a smaller role in the IPO-versus-acquisition decision. The
automatic conversion provision usually only applies in an IPO (Hellmann 2006)
and is a precommitment to give up control rights when the firm is offered a
sufficiently valuable exit (as in Black and Gilson 1998). An IPO registration
right can be viewed as the right of investors to force an IPO. Similarly, a piggyback right applies only in an IPO. A co-sale right, a right of first refusal, and a
veto against change in control all give investors protection if the entrepreneur
tries to sell the firm in part or whole to a new owner (Chemla, Habib, and
Ljungqvist 2007 analyze some of these provisions). Information rights typically
call for the firm to supply timely financial statements and related materials.
These rights have no direct bearing on the exit decision. So, in the remainder
of the article, I use the term “strong VC control rights” to refer to contractual
control rights that are relevant to IPOs versus acquisitions, including the dragalong, redemption, and antidilution rights, as well as the right to replace the
CEO, majority votes, and majority boards.
1955

<-----Page 9----->The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008

Written contracts include many of these contractual terms; however, I note
that the right to replace the CEO is almost never an explicit contractual clause
between the investor and the entrepreneur. In Italy, for example, Cumming and
Zambelli (2007) document that an explicit clause to replace the CEO would
be illegal in the period considered by my data set. Rather, the right to replace
the CEO comes from the voting power (and, in some cases, special voting
rights) of the investor with respect to board seats and ownership interest in the
firm. For some investments, this right to replace the CEO becomes effective
only in the event of nonperformance by the entrepreneur. (Performance hurdles
are set up as conditions for the initial investment.) However, in my empirical
analyses with limited degrees of freedom, controls for different standards are
not tractable. Therefore, my variable for the right to replace the CEO is a
dummy variable equal to 1 if the investor informed me that there was some
mechanism in the contract by which the investor(s) could bring about such a
change.
I note that across financing rounds, the European investors did not indicate
significant alterations to their contract structures, such as a change in the use
of one security or another across rounds, or the inclusion/exclusion of terms
such as veto rights and the right to replace the founding entrepreneur as CEO.
Over the course of interviews with the fund managers who provided the data, I
learned that, generally, an extreme event would be needed to warrant alteration
of specific terms across rounds. The investors indicated that such extreme
changes would lead to a breakdown in the relationship between the investor
and entrepreneur, and would be unduly costly to renegotiate.
Founder ownership and control do, however, tend to get diluted in each
financing round, particularly when more syndicated investors are added in a
new round. In such cases, the basis for coding is the first-round investment
data, because there are differing numbers of rounds prior to exit and a number
of nonexits in the data, so that the final round ownership and control data are
not directly comparable; also, by the last investment round, ownership and
control rights are likely to be more endogenous to exit outcomes than are those
at the initial investment round. Regardless, I find that the primary results are
robust to the use of different periods of measurement for terms that vary across
rounds. Obviously, there are also contingencies in certain contractual terms,
such as contingencies pertaining to ownership percentages. I use the ownership
percentages in the event of successful outcomes, not write-offs. In a few cases,
the common stock has limited redemption rights (jointly with liquidation rights)
attached to them, and other veto and control rights. I do not find that attributes
of the common stock variables make a material difference to the exit results,
other than what is recorded separately in the other variables. Table 1 lists the
veto rights, control rights, etc.
Other variables for transaction characteristics include a dummy for whether
there are VCs invested in the entrepreneurial firm prior to the respondent
investor. This dummy controls for differences across VCs that originate the

1956

<-----Page 10----->Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance

deal. To control for size effects I also include a variable for the book value
of the initial investment of the respondent VC. Due to data limitations, I do
not control for other VC investment amounts, because I could not determine
all amounts of other investors. Nor do I include the amount invested in all
financing rounds, since that amount would be endogenous (Gompers 1995).
Table 1 also shows the variables for investor characteristics. I consider
dummy variables equal to 1 for noncaptive VCs. Captives often behave differently than noncaptives, because they have strategic reasons for investing
in firms that are developing technologies relevant to the larger organization.
Hence, they might be more likely to exit by acquisition when the acquirer is
the affiliated company of the captive (Gompers and Lerner 1999; Hellmann
2002; Cumming 2005; Riyanto and Schwienbacher 2006). Noncaptives often have pay incentives that attract superior VC talent (Gompers and Lerner
1999), which could lead to an association between noncaptives and IPOs. VCs
with more capital might also have superior talent, which could result in an
association with IPOs. I also consider dummy variables for different funds.
Table 1 also defines various investee characteristics that I use in my specifications. I use dummy variables for different stages of development at the
time of first investment, because later stage investments could be connected
to different exit outcomes, regardless of contract terms and other factors. I
use the ranking of the entrepreneur by the VC as a variable to control for
entrepreneurial quality. The rank is on a scale of one (lowest) to ten (highest). I note that this ranking was made in 2002 when, although there had been
many IPOs by this time, many investments had not yet exited. Hence, there
is some degree of look-back bias that cannot be avoided for the pre-2002 exits. But this look-back bias overcompensates for this factor in the direction of
IPOs, and hence this control variable is quite appropriate. I also control for
industry market/book values at the time of exit because higher market/book
industries are more likely to be associated with IPOs (Gompers and Lerner
1999).
As in Gompers and Lerner (1999), I use MSCI returns for the three months
prior to exit and for the six- to three-month period prior to exit to control
for market conditions. I use the year of investment and year of exit dummy
variables to control for market conditions and hot-issue markets. I use variables
for country-specific market capitalization and the legality index of the country
of domicile of the entrepreneur, and country dummy variables, since law quality
can influence the development of VC and stock markets and the likelihood of
an IPO exit (La Porta et al. 1998; Shliefer and Wolfenzon 2002; Armour and
Cumming 2006; Cumming, Fleming, and Schwienbacher 2006).
3. Data
In this section I describe the data and I provide summary statistics and comparison of means and medians tests.

1957

<-----Page 11----->The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008

3.1 Sample description
The data comprise 223 entrepreneurial firms financed by 35 VC funds from 11
continental European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech, Denmark, France,
Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Switzerland. The VCs
financed these firms between 1995 and 2002. There are 32 IPOs, 74 acquisitions,
17 buybacks, and 64 write-offs between 1996 and 2003, comprising a total of
187 VC financings. There were thirty-six unexited investments as of December
2005, the time of this study. The unit of analysis is the entrepreneurial firm, not
an investment round, or the syndicated investor (staging and/or syndication is
not double-counted in the data).
To collect the data, I first sent surveys to all continental European funds that
were members of the European Venture Capital Association (EVCA) between
January 2002 and January 2003. I carried out follow-up interviews in person
for most Dutch, Belgian, and German funds, and by phone for funds in other
countries. Some of the funds did not provide details on all of their investments;
rather, the manager(s) only provided data for specific investments or deals on
which the manager(s) worked. I studied and analyzed actual contracts, with the
assistance of the VC managers alongside a Ph.D. student in law, in 2004 and
2005. The survey and interview method revealed information not found in a
written contract.
To ensure the integrity of the data collected, I promised the respondents
that the information collected from the thirty-five funds would remain strictly
confidential and would not be made publicly available. The data were disclosed
on a completely voluntary basis. Given the type of confidential information
collected, I cannot refer to an aggregate industry database for comparison.
However, I can point out that in terms of the frequency of IPOs, acquisitions,
and write-offs, my sample is similar to prior data sets on VC exits (Cumming
and MacIntosh 2003a, 2003b; Schwienbacher 2003; Cochrane 2005).
The scope of other VC data sets (Cumming and MacIntosh 2003a, 2003b;
Schwienbacher 2003; Kaplan and Strömberg 2003; Lerner and Schoar 2005)
is also similar to mine in terms of detail and number of observations. Further,
the frequency of the use of particular contracts is similar to that reported in this
study, thus accounting for institutional differences between the United States
and Europe. The most notable institutional difference between Europe and the
United States is in the use of convertible securities in the United States (Sahlman
1990; Bergmann and Hege 1998; Gompers 1998; Schwienbacher 2003; Kaplan
and Strömberg 2003). Among all countries where VC contract data have been
collected, the United States is the only country in the world in which convertible
preferred equity is used most frequently (Cumming 2005). Tax considerations
are one explanation for the dominant use of convertible securities for VCbacked firms in the United States (Gilson and Schizer 2003). I do not exclude
investments in the sample based on the security used. For instance, I report the
use of straight preferred investments, because this security is also occasionally
used by Canadian and U.S. VCs that invest in Canada (Cumming 2005), and

1958

<-----Page 12----->Contracts and Exits in Venture Capital Finance

by VCs in developing countries (Lerner and Schoar 2005). Regardless, in my
data, the results are robust to the inclusion/exclusion of this subsample.

3.2 Summary statistics
Table 2 shows the total number of investments each year, with breakdowns by
the type of security used in each year of first investment. The time variations in
the contracts are consistent with other international data sets (see, e.g., Kaplan,
Martel, and Strömberg 2007). The data indicate that the greatest number of
investments occurred in 2000. This finding is consistent with the aggregate
EVCA data (http://www.evca.com). The EVCA does not record details of
contracts.
One important aspect of the data is that syndicated investors almost invariably
used the same securities as the investors who provided these data. I observe
differences in only six of 223 cases. These are the cases in which the syndicated
investor used common equity or warrants while the respondent investor used a
security involving debt and/or preferred equity.
Due to considerations of confidentiality, I do not provide details for each
of the thirty-five funds. I can best describe the funds as “generalist” funds
that have a broad focus on entrepreneurs at different stages of development,
from very early to very late. The lack of specialization of VCs in Europe is a
function of the depth of the market, particularly in continental Europe. (I note
that the U.S. market has funds with a much greater degree of specialization;
see Gompers and Lerner 1999, 2001a,b.) Some funds in my sample are part of
a larger corporation or bank (captive funds); some are noncaptive VCs (limited
partnerships). I examine country (and fund) effects in my multivariate tests
and focus on the countries that involve a majority of the exits. No single fund
provides more than twenty investments, and no single fund or country accounts
for a majority of the exits.
Table 3 provides summary statistics across columns 1–12 and differences
tests across columns 13–18. The table summarizes the data for all observations,
as well as for the subsample of IPOs, acquisitions, and write-off exits. The
subsamples of buybacks and nonexits are not summarized in Table 3 for reasons
of conciseness. Because Table 3 does not summarize the data for any particular
fund, greater details are possible without compromising the confidentiality of
any single fund. The funds from the Eastern European countries are small; funds
from elsewhere in Europe are large. I control for fund size in the multivariate
empirical analyses.
The results of comparison tests in Table 3 (columns 13–18) provide a number
of insights into the role of VCs in IPOs compared to acquisitions. The most
important results appear in column 13 (for comparison of medians tests) and
column 16 (comparison of means and proportions tests). The data indicate that
IPOs are more likely than acquisitions for common equity investments when the
mean and median public market returns have been greater in the months prior

Mean tests and comparison of proportions tests

This table presents a summary of the data by the total sample (columns 1–3), IPOs (columns 4–6), acquisitions (columns 7–9), and write-offs (columns 10–12). Median values are
presented; means are not presented for reasons of conciseness. Proportions represent the fraction of the number of observations on the top row for each column. The table does not
show minimum and maximum values for proportions, because the minimum is always 0 and the maximum is always 1. Investment years span 1995–2002. Exit years span 1996–2005.
Variables are as defined in Table 1. The table shows comparison tests for differences in medians, means, and proportions of various characteristics of the investors and entrepreneurs
for the different exit outcomes. The mean test is the standard test for two samples and based on the t-distribution, under the assumption that population distributions are normal. The
median test is the two-sample equivalent of the one-sample sign test, and does not have any distributional assumptions and/or any assumptions about the population variance. See
http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/Service/Statistics.html for a summary of these different test statistics. ∗ , ∗∗ , ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.

to exit (consistent with Gompers and Lerner 1999), and among countries with
greater stock market capitalization (consistent with Black and Gilson 1998).
A higher ranking of the entrepreneur by the VC (on a scale of 1–10) is
associated with a greater probability of an IPO (column 16), and median IRRs
are higher for IPOs than acquisitions (column 13). There are other differences,
depending on industry and stage of first investment. The table shows that more
high-tech firms (with high market/book ratios) and early stage firms are more
likely to go public (column 16) and more likely to be written off (column 18).
The summary statistics in Table 3 support the central hypothesis in this article
by indicating that acquisitions are more likely when the investor has greater
control rights. Investments in which the investor has the right to replace the
CEO are more often associated with acquisitions than with IPOs. Write-offs
also are less common among investments in which the investor has the right
to replace the founding entrepreneur as CEO. Acquisitions are more likely for
investments with convertible debt and convertible preferred equity, with mixes
of debt or preferred equity with common equity, and for investments with a
greater proportion of investor veto rights and control rights.
In Table 4, panels A and B show two correlation matrices. Panel A presents
correlations across exit outcomes, and investor, entrepreneur, transaction, market, and institutional variables. Panel B presents correlations across exit outcomes and transaction characteristics, and the country dummy variables. Significant correlations at the 5% level appear in boldface and are consistent with
the comparison tests in Table 3.
One implication of Table 4 panel A is that common equity is a proxy for
weak VC control rights. The table shows that investors are less likely to use veto
and control rights when the VC uses common equity. This finding is consistent
with related theoretical work on the topic.5
Table 4 panel B presents correlations across country-specific dummy variables. I find statistically significant values in certain cases. Therefore, I use
country dummy variables for these countries to check the robustness in my
empirical tests. However, I note that the country dummies might reflect fundspecific factors, as there are not many funds in the data for each of the specific
countries. I also examine fund dummy variables, but due to collinearity and
a loss of degrees of freedom, not all such dummy variables can be included
simultaneously with the country dummy variables.
4. Multivariate Regressions
Here, I describe my regression model specifications, robustness checks, and
extensions.

Cestone (2002) argues that common equity with strong investor veto and control rights would give the investor
too great an incentive to intervene in the entrepreneurial firm. Casmatta (2003) argues that common equity is
used to encourage advice, whereas convertible claims and contractual control rights tend to be used to facilitate
monitoring.

Panel B: Correlations across country dummy variables and contracts and exits2

This table presents correlation coefficients across various contractual variables, exit outcomes, market variables, and legal variables. Because the following variables are contingent on exit
and the exit year, the sample comprises only the exit sample of 187 exited companies for the following variables: IPO, acquisition, write-off, IRR, MSCI prior year, and market capitalization.
For all other variables, the sample represents the full sample of all 223 exited and unexited investments. The variables are as defined in Table 1. Correlations highlighted in boldface are
statistically significant at the 5% level.

4.1 Base regression models
Table 5 reports two multinomial logit regression models of the impact of
VC fund, entrepreneurial firm, transaction details, and market and institutional
conditions on exit outcomes. I present the marginal effects from the multinomial
logit estimates to illustrate explicitly economic significance as well as statistical
significance. The marginal effects indicate the probability of each exit outcome
that is associated with the particular right-hand-side variable. The explanatory
variables are as defined in Table 1. I do not use year-of-exit dummy variables
because buybacks and nonexits are both possible outcomes (besides IPOs,
acquisitions, and write-offs). There were buybacks only in 2004 and 2005,
and nonexits are as of 2005, thus, the year-of-exit dummies would give rise
to problems of perfect collinearity. Model II is presented alongside model I to
show different explanatory variables.
The strongest finding in Table 5 is the relation between transaction characteristics and exit outcomes. There is a positive association between acquisitions,
strong VC control rights, and the right to replace the founding entrepreneur
as CEO. There is a negative association between IPOs and VC control rights.
Further, the data indicate a negative association between write-offs and VC
control rights.
Model I indicates that the right to replace the CEO is associated with a
38.6% greater probability of an acquisition. The economic significance is lower,
at 23.6%, in model II when I add correlated variables—including majority
boards, majority votes, veto rights, and the sum of drag-along, redemption,
and antidilution rights—on the right-hand side. Majority boards are associated
with a 23.7% increase in the probability of an acquisition in model I and an
18.4% increase in model II. Model II shows that each additional control right
(drag-along, redemption, and antidilution rights) results in an additional 12.2%
increase in the probability of an acquisition exit. The evidence on majority
boards, right to replace the CEO, and VC control rights is consistent with
the notion that entrepreneurs derive a nonpecuniary benefit associated with
being the CEO of a publicly listed firm, and that investor control is valuable in
effecting acquisitions when entrepreneurs would otherwise prefer an IPO for
nonpecuniary reasons.
In Table 5, the most important variable for IPO exits is that of market conditions. Public market returns in the three months prior to exit are closely
related to IPOs. In terms of economic significance, the regression models indicate that an increase in public market returns from 1% to 4% increases
the probability of an IPO by approximately 1%. The role of public market
returns in the three-month period prior to the IPO very strongly supports
the evidence for the U.S. market presented by Gompers and Lerner (1999).
The variable for the three- to six-month MSCI return is not significant, nor
is a variable for the MSCI return in the year prior to the IPO date. I do
not use this variable in the regressions, but the results are available on request. Finally, in Table 5 note that captive VCs are approximately 22% more

This table presents multinomial logit estimates of the impact of investor characteristics, investee characteristics, transaction characteristics, market conditions, and
institutional and legal factors on the various VC exit outcomes: IPOs, acquisitions, buybacks, and write-offs. Models I and II examine all 223 exits and nonexits. The
variables are as defined in Table 1. I use investment-year dummy variables for 2000 and 2001, and country dummy variables for The Netherlands and Germany. I do not
use additional year and country dummy variables due to perfect collinearity problems. I use the MSCI returns prior to exit for 2005 for the no-exit observations. The
table presents values for the marginal effects, not the standard multinomial logit coefficients, in order to explicitly highlight economic significance alongside statistical
significance. The marginal effects are not presented for the no-exit outcomes for reasons of conciseness. Standard errors are clustered by VC fund (see, e.g., Petersen
forthcoming). White’s (1980) HCCME is used in all models. ∗ , ∗∗ , ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

likely to exit by acquisition than noncaptive VCs, as expected (see subsection
1.2).
4.2 Endogeneity
Table 6 presents regression models on the determinants of exit outcomes that are
similar to those in Table 5, but with one major exception. In Table 6, I examine
the effect of endogeneity of control rights on exits. I use two-step instrumental
variable estimates. Step 1 of models III and IV accounts for the factors that
affect the extent of VC control. Step 1 of model III considers binomial logit
estimates for majority board seats and the right to replace the CEO. Step 1 of
model IV considers ordered logit estimates of the control rights index for the
sum of dummy variables for drag-along, redemption, and antidilution rights.
Step 2 of models III and IV estimates the multinomial logit model of exit
outcomes.
In Table 6, I use the exogenous variables that are included in step 1 and
excluded in step 2 of models III and IV. These variables are the La Porta
et al. (1998) indexes for creditor rights and antidirector (shareholder) rights.
These instruments are intuitively related to contract terms, as confirmed by
all of the correlations that are reported in Table 7. I do not expect to find a
relation between creditor rights and exit outcomes, unless the efficiency of
bankruptcy law is related to write-offs. Table 7 indicates that creditor rights
are not statistically related to any of the exit outcomes, which confirms the
suitability of that instrument for the data. Antidirector rights may be positively
related to the probability of an IPO (La Porta et al. 1998), but the data here
indicate the opposite. The correlation between antidirector rights and IPO exits
is −0.18. This negative correlation can only be explained by independent
factors driving the IPO exits, and by little or no direct relation between IPOs
and antidirector rights. In contrast, the antidirector rights index is significant
and negatively related to the contract terms. This finding is consistent with the
view that as shareholders, VCs use contracts as substitutes for the absence of
strong legal protection (Lerner and Schoar 2005). Creditor rights are positively
and significantly related to contract terms, which is intuitive, because when
decisions have to be made in times of financial distress, VCs as shareholders
want priority over and above creditors. Also, I use the industry market/book
value at the time of first investment as an instrumental variable. This is a valid
instrument because the second-step regressions use the industry market/book
value at the time of exit. The results of the second-step regressions are similar
when I use the different instruments and different specifications for the first-step
regressions, and are available on request.
In Table 6, the step 1 evidence in models III and IV indicates that creditor
rights are statistically and positively related to the extent of VC control and
to the right to replace the CEO, but not statistically related to majority board
seats. A one-point increase in the creditor rights index (on the scale of 0–4)
increases the probability of the VC acquiring the right to replace the CEO by

This table presents instrumental multinomial logit estimates of the impact of investor characteristics, investee characteristics, transaction characteristics, market conditions, and institutional
and legal factors on the various VC exit outcomes IPOs, acquisitions, buybacks, and write-offs. Models III and IV examine all 223 exits and nonexits. The variables are as defined in Table
1. I use investment-year dummy variables for 2000 and 2001, and country dummy variables for The Netherlands and Germany. I do not use additional year and country dummy variables
due to perfect collinearity problems, i.e., where there is no variation for any one of the exit outcomes associated with a year and/or a country. I use the MSCI returns prior to exit for
2005 for the no-exit observations. In model III, step 1, I first regress the binary dependent variables for the right to replace the CEO and majority board seats on investee characteristics,
investment dummies, and the legal indexes for antidirector and creditor rights. Panel B presents the correlations between endogenous variables, instruments, and exit outcomes. Step 2 of
model III then uses the fitted values of the step 1 regressions for the right to replace the CEO and majority board seats variables. Model IV is identical to model III, except that step 1 of
model III uses an ordered logit estimate of the number of control rights for the sum of drag-along, redemption, and antidilution rights and then the fitted values of that estimated variable
for step 2. For step 1 in model III and step 2 in models III and IV, to explicitly highlight economic significance alongside statistical significance, the values are the marginal effects, not
the standard multinomial logit coefficients. Step 1 in model IV presents values of the standard ordered logit coefficients, not the marginal effects for each ranked outcome, for reasons of
conciseness. Step 2 in models III and IV does not show the marginal effects for the buyback and no-exit outcomes for reasons of conciseness. Standard errors are clustered by VC fund.

This table presents correlations between the instruments (creditor rights, antidirector rights, and industry market/book at first investment), the endogenous variables (right to replace CEO, majority board seats, and the
control rights index), and the second-step exit outcome variables (IPOs, acquisitions, and write-offs). Correlations are for the full sample for the contract terms, and for the subsample of 187 exits for the exit variables.
Correlations that are statistically significant at the 5% level are highlighted in boldface.

31.6%. I note that although the creditor and antidirector rights are negatively
correlated (−0.42 for this sample), the statistical and economic significance
of the regressions is not materially affected by the inclusion or exclusion of
these variables. For instance, excluding antidirector rights in step 1 of model
III in Table 6 increases the economic significance of creditor rights from 31.6%
to 34.3% for the right to replace the CEO without changing the statistical
significance.
A one-point increase in the creditor rights index also increases the probability of an extra control right (drag-along, redemption, or antidilution) by on
average approximately 3%. The economic significance of a one-point increase
in creditor rights is 4.9% to move from two to three, and 2.6% to move from
three to four in step 1 of model IV.
In contrast, antidirector rights are more closely tied to majority board seats.
An increase of one point in the index (on the scale of 0–6) reduces the probability
of VC majority board seats by 12.6%. The step 1 regressions in Table 6 further
indicate that VCs are more likely to have a majority on the board and to have
greater control rights for those firms in industries with higher market/book
ratios (high-tech industries). VCs are less likely to take majority board seats,
have the right to replace the CEO, and have other control rights for earlier-stage
investments. VCs are also less likely to have the right to replace the CEO and
other control rights when the entrepreneur has a higher experience ranking.
The step 2 regressions in models III and IV in Table 6 are consistent with
those reported for models I and II in Table 5. Majority board seats lead to a
22.3% increase in the probability of an acquisition exit (model III), and each
additional control right increases the probability of an acquisition by 14.5%
(model IV). The one result that differs from models I and II is that the right to
replace the CEO is statistically insignificant in model III.
In general, the alternative specifications for the step 1 and 2 regressions in
Table 6 invariably support at least one of the VC control right variables as being

1973

<-----Page 27----->The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008

significantly related to acquisition exits. The instrumental variables regressions
are not completely robust to alternative specifications, but nevertheless indicate
support for the central proposition in the paper that VC control influences the
IPO-versus-acquisition choice, even after controlling for endogeneity.
4.3 Additional robustness checks
In this subsection I describe the results from six additional robustness checks
(models V–X) that are presented in Table 8. I also discuss a number of additional
robustness checks that were carried out but not explicitly reported.
So that I can include dummy variables for exit years, models V–X exclude
buyback and non exits from the sample. Model V presents a standard specification without buybacks and nonexits that is comparable to model I without
such exclusions. The regression results are similar and continue to support my
central hypothesis.
Model VI provides a similar regression, but excludes investment years 1995–
1998, because I want to check if contracts are related to exits in a way that is
driven by the time period spanned by the data. For instance, if VCs in Europe
were less sophisticated in the mid-1990s, and thus wrote less detailed contracts,
and since market conditions enabled different exit opportunities in the Internet
bubble period, then contracts might be connected to exits for reasons unrelated
to the hypotheses discussed in subsection 1.1. However, the estimates in model
VI indicate that the data do not support this alternative explanation of the
results. The relation between VC control rights and acquisitions continues to
hold for the subsample that excludes investment years 1995–1998. The results
also hold for other subsamples that exclude other periods that are not explicitly
presented here. These results are available on request.
Regression models V–VIII in Table 8 indicate a negative relation between the
right to replace the CEO and write-offs. That is, detailed VC contracts tend to
enable the VC to prevent “bad” outcomes. In model VII, for example, the right
to replace the founding entrepreneur reduces the probability of a write-off by
31.7%, and the control rights (drag-along, redemption, and antidilution) reduce
the probability of a write-off by 18.2%. Although the correlation between the
right to replace the CEO and the control rights index is 0.54 (Table 7), excluding either variable from model VII in separate regressions (not reported but
available on request) does not materially affect the significance and magnitude
of the positive effect of VC control on acquisitions and the negative effect of
VC control on write-offs. The finding that stronger VC control reduces the
probability of a write-off is consistent with Lerner (1995) and Gompers and
Lerner (1999). It is also consistent with the Kaplan, Martel, and Strömberg
(2007) result that international VC funds that do use contracts with strong
VC control rights are more likely to survive the Internet bubble crash after
2000.
My results suggest that strong VC rights are more likely to protect a VC’s
interest and force an acquisition. Weak control rights are more often associated

Model X: subsample of funds that provided all investments

This table presents additional robustness checks on the multinomial logit estimates of the impact of investor characteristics, investee characteristics, transaction characteristics, market
conditions, and institutional and legal factors on the VC exit outcomes IPOs, acquisitions, buybacks, and write-offs. To use dummy variables for exit years (2000–2005), investment
years (1997–2002), and countries (Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, and Switzerland), models V–X present estimates excluding buybacks and non exits. Model VI excludes the
subsample of investments in 1995–1998. Model VII excludes the subsample of preplanned exits. Models VIII and IX examine the subsample of investments at the seed-money and
expansion stages, and only the seed stage, respectively. Model X examines the subsample of funds that provided all of their investments as at 2002. To explicitly highlight economic
significance alongside statistical significance, the values are the marginal effects, not the standard multinomial logit coefficients. Standard errors are clustered by VC fund. White’s
(1980) HCCME is used in all models. ∗ , ∗∗ , ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

with IPOs, but are also associated with write-offs and a noncovered investment.
For instance, there were fifteen pure common equity investments in the data with
absolutely no control rights above and beyond those held by the entrepreneur.
Among those, six were IPOs, six were write-offs, and three were not yet exited
in 2005. I also note that the trend in the European data is more often toward
using convertible securities, both in the data introduced in this article (Table 2)
and in the Kaplan, Martel, and Strömberg (2007) data. These trends also are
consistent with the use of greater downside protection after the crash of the
Internet bubble on 14 April 2000, which caused a major downturn in the market.
To control for the possibility of endogeneity of contracts vis-à-vis exits,
model VII excludes the preplanned exits in the data. In the full sample of 223
investments, 70 of the investments (31.4%) indicate a degree of preplanned
exit behavior at the time of investment (and do not necessarily indicate such
plans to the investee); 55 of the 70 (79%) are exited investments in our sample
as of 2005. This evidence on preplanning behavior suggests the possibility of
endogeneity vis-à-vis contracts and exits, although the VCs indicate that the
preplanned exit outcome was by no means certain at the time of investment.
Among the preplanned exits, the investors indicate that their (preplanned)
strategy turned out to have the desired result only 53% of the time (Cumming
and Johan 2007c). Regression model VII in Table 8 indicates that the results are
robust to excluding preplanned exits. This finding is strongly consistent with
alternative controls for endogeneity in Table 6.
In models VIII and IX, I examine the subsample of only seed investments, i.e.,
start-ups at the time of first VC investment, and seed and expansion investments,
respectively. These are important to show that the results are not driven by
investments that were close to exiting at the time of first investment.6 Model X
examines only the funds that provided all of their investments as of 2002, which
means that I had to reject the observations of fifteen funds. This robustness
check is important to show that the results are not affected by VCs withholding
information on some of their investments, such as the poorer performing ones.
All of the estimates consistently support the central propositions that relate
contracts to exits. In other models (not reported but available on request), I
consider dummy variables for funds, rather than countries. The results show
that fund effects are not driving the results. However, I note that I could not use
dummy variables for twelve funds because of collinearity problems. Further,
in other models, which are available on request, I consider different definitions
of certain variables to show that the results are not driven by the model specifications. These models use dummy variables for seed, expansion, and late
stages. At the time of the first VC investment, there are 69 seed investments,
82 expansion investments, 32 late investments, and 40 buyouts in the data. The
6

Most of the econometric specifications in Tables 5, 6, and 8 use a dummy variable for early/expansion stages.
One difficulty with using more specific definitions of stages of development is that such terms are sometimes
interpreted differently in different countries. However, I attempted as best as possible to mitigate such definitional
problems in recording the data.

1977

<-----Page 31----->The Review of Financial Studies / v 21 n 5 2008

models also use a dummy variable for entrepreneurs with rankings of seven or
more (as an alternative to the other models with the ranking variable on the oneto-ten scale) and a second VC dummy for both captive and noncaptive VCs.
(I suppress the captive bank VC dummy for reasons of collinearity.) Because
there are twenty-eight exits of foreign investments and nine unexited foreign
investments, I also include a variable for the exits in which the investment is
initially in a foreign firm. Also, I consider the use of different contract terms,
which I include as right-hand-side variables. When I use common equity as a
proxy for weak VC control rights, I find that it is associated with a 12.3% greater
chance of an IPO and a 30.1% smaller chance of an acquisition. These findings
are consistent with the comparison tests in Table 3. In a similar specification, I
find that drag-along rights are more important in effecting an acquisition than
are redemption or antidilution rights. Drag-along rights are associated with
a 15.8% reduction in the probability of an IPO and a 31.5% increase in the
probability of an acquisition.
I also considered other robustness checks, such as Heckman’s (1976, 1979)
sample selection corrections, to control for the nonrandom selection of an exit
event versus an on going investment in the portfolio.7 The results are robust.
These checks are not reported here but are available on request.
5. Conclusion
In this article I introduce a new data set that is based on 35 European VC funds
and 223 entrepreneurial firms in 11 continental European countries. My sample
covers the years 1995–2005. Detailed contract data indicate a wide range of
cash flow and control rights. Among the 223 entrepreneurial firms, there are
187 IPO, acquisition, and write-off exits. Controlling for market conditions,
legal and institutional factors, and a variety of entrepreneurial firm and VC
characteristics, the data highlight a statistically and economically significant
positive association between acquisitions and the use of VC veto and control
rights, particularly the right to replace the founding entrepreneur as CEO. The
relation between strong VC rights and acquisitions is robust to controls for
endogeneity and the exclusion of preplanned exit transactions.
Although many regressions presented in this article show some differences
in economic significance, the data indicate that the probability of an acquisition
is approximately 30% more likely when VCs have effective contractual control
rights, such as drag-along rights, board control, and the ability to replace the
founding entrepreneur as CEO. The data further show that weak VC control
rights are associated with a greater probability of IPO exits and a greater probability of write-off exits. The new evidence in this article supports a growing
7

Unexited investments tend to be poorer performing ones and VCs on average inflate valuations of unexited
investments to their institutional investors (Cumming and Walz 2004; Cochrane 2005; Cumming, Fleming, and
Schwienbacher 2006; Beuselinck and Manigart 2007; Cumming and Johan 2007a).
