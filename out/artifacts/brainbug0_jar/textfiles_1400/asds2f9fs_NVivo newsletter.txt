NVivo 8 to break boundaries
with audio and video capabilities
Imagine a project where your text, audio and video data sit side by side.
Click on a video file and see a focus group in action. Then click on a link
in that file to an audio recording, where you hear a related interview. At
the same time, read your linked transcript to find out more about the
speaker and the body language they’re using, and make a note about
your interpretations.

Due for launch in 2008,
NVivo 8 is about to make
this a reality.

Due for launch in the first quarter of
2008, researchers can expect a host
of new features to be announced in
coming months.

NVivo 8 is set to revolutionize the way
you can access, analyze and share
the information collected throughout
your project. For the first time, our
software will allow you to work with
audio and video files – including
your observational videos, interview
recordings and media clips - in exactly
the same way as text. What’s more,
you’ll be able to work with these files
even if you don’t have a transcript.

“NVivo 8 isn’t just a revised
version of NVivo 7 with
extras added on. The range
of exciting new functions
will be seamlessly
integrated with the entire
analysis process.” said
Adam Long, QSR’s Software
Development Director.

Message from the CEO
Establishing the foundation for even greater things to come
from John Owen, CEO, QSR International
Welcome to the 32nd edition of NSight. The first half of 2007 has seen QSR continue to go
from strength to strength. At the halfway point of the year we’re already proud of several
new achievements.
The launch of our new website last month was a major milestone for QSR. We’ve taken a
completely fresh approach to the site and what it can offer to researchers by including a
wider range of resources including free support materials, resource articles and online
tutorials. We’ve also put a lot of effort into streamlining our online shopping process.
And we hope you’re as delighted with the end result as we are.
With the increasing popularity of the Internet as a source of information and support, the
new website will provide us with the platform to continue to lead the way in qualitative
research software into the future and, most importantly, allow us to deliver more to our users
than ever before.
On the topic of innovation, the announcement of the next release of NVivo scheduled for
early 2008 is testament to our commitment to provide the best possible tools for qualitative
research. We’re excited by the potential of the new audio and video capabilities in NVivo 8.
I encourage you to read pages 3 to 4 for all the details, and please continue to watch this
space as we make further announcements.
In the last newsletter we also announced our new partnership with Japanese firm, Hulinks.
Activities in this area have progressed at a significant rate, and the Japanese version of
NVivo 7 is now selling. I attended a press conference in Tokyo to launch the software last
month and was really pleased at the tremendous interest from qualitative researchers from
so many fields.
In fact, we’re now seeing a growing demand for research services and software in other
Asian markets. This has presented us with an exciting opportunity to further impact the way
qualitative research is managed and I’ll be visiting China later in the year to explore this. We
hope Japan is just the beginning.
Please read on to find out more about what’s new at QSR and what’s happening in the world
of research.
Best wishes,

John Owen
CEO, QSR International

Video, audio and documents.
Have you ever wished you could
work with all of your research
material in the same way and in one
software program?
The next release in the ground-breaking NVivo product line – NVivo 8 –
will allow you to work with your video, audio and text files and so much more.
Due to be released in early 2008, NVivo 8 is a future that allows researchers to manage, categorize and extract meaning from
a whole range of different data sources. It’s a future that also does away with the need to have audio and video files transcribed
before they can be analyzed.

Incorporate video and audio
in your analysis
NVivo 8 can now handle the
largest volumes of data in a range
of different formats, including
observational videos, video taped
group sessions, media clips,
interview recordings... even
podcasts and music.
You can watch or listen to your files,
pause them, fast forward, rewind or
skip sections, just as you would with
a normal media player.
NVivo 8 also allows you to work
with your videos and audio files in
the same way that you work with
your documents. You can code
them, annotate, add quick links,
view coding stripes, search them,
query them, see them in your nodes
or within a model. You can even
use ‘undo’ to retrace your steps
for any of these actions. So for
those currently using our NVivo 7
software, there’s hardly any need

to learn new features. And all your
project information, not just your
documents, can now be analyzed in
one place and viewed together.

Work with or without a
transcript

Already have a transcript? If you
already have a transcript, you can
import it into NVivo and it will be
directly linked to the audio or video
file it belongs to.

• Windows video files (.avi)

Need to create a transcript?
For the first time you can choose
to create a transcript in NVivo.
Create a comprehensive transcript
for an entire audio or video file;
create a transcript just for the
section of the file that’s relevant
to your work; or create a log that
consists of keywords for example.
You add the words and NVivo adds
the time stamps. There’s no need
to buy a separate module either.
These features are built in to one
software program.

• Movie files (.mpeg, .mpg)

(continued next page)

NVivo 8 offers incredible flexibility,
especially when it comes to
transcripts. Work with them, work
without them or create them as
you go.
The software’s inbuilt media players
allow you to import and work with
a range of popular file formats
including:
• Windows media video files (.wmv)

• Quick Time movie files (.mov, .qt)
• Windows audio files (.wav)
• Windows media audio files (.wma)
• Music files (.mp3).

Working with your existing projects
NVivo 8 will allow you to open and work with previous versions of QSR software including NVivo 7, NVivo 2,
NVivo 1, N6 (NUD*IST 6), N5 (NUD*IST 5) and N4 (NUD*IST 4).

<-----Page 3----->Nsight

You can even analyze
your research material
as you transcribe if you
choose. Make observations
as you go, code sections or
annotate sections of the recording
to revisit later.
And because the main body of your
transcript is created in rich text
format, you have the flexibility to
format your transcript - change font
colors or size, or use bold or italics.
The choice is yours.
Prefer to work without a
transcript? In other software
programs, this just isn’t possible.
Interviews have to be transcribed
and imported before starting any
analysis. However, a picture often
tells a thousand words and in
NVivo 8, you are no longer tied
to transcripts when it comes to
qualitative data analysis. You can
work straight from your audio or
video files - directly code, annotate
or link any section of your audio or
video content as it plays.

Explore the links between
your media files and
transcripts
If you’re working with transcripts,
they are linked directly to the audio
or video files they belong to. As
your video plays in NVivo 8, your
transcript scrolls through too. Stop
the video and your transcript stops
too. See a comment written in a
transcript? Click through to the

section of the video that it refers to.
It’s all completely integrated.
You even have the flexibility to
control how you see this on the
screen. Want to see the transcript
to the side of your video? Then
adjust the viewing pane. Or want to
see the transcript underneath the
video? You can do that too.

Never miss nuances or
non-verbal cues again
Transcripts can often consist of
more than just dialogue, and for
the first time NVivo 8 lets you
analyze nuances and non-verbal
communication directly.
With NVivo 8, information can
be collected on body language,
speakers, nuances in conversation
… virtually anything that’s important
to your research. Capture and note
extended pauses in the responses
of interview subjects, hostility,
restlessness, dominating behaviour
or closed body language.
You collect this information using
a range of custom fields within
your transcripts which can then
be filtered on, or even autocoded.
You can also insert symbols. For
instance, to facilitate conversational
analysis you might use a symbol to
represent a specific verbal cue such
as a sigh.



Requirements
There’s no need for you to acquire
new software or licenses to play
your media files in NVivo. The
components required to play your
audio and video files will be loaded
as part of the NVivo 8 installation.

Add to your research
NVivo 8 also allows you to start
your research right away, even if
your transcript isn’t ready or the
recording of your group session
hasn’t arrived yet. Just use your
notes to start your research and
add the files to your project at a
later stage. They’ll merge
seamlessly with the analysis that’s
already been completed.

Same look, new features
Like our current NVivo software
– NVivo 7 – the next release has
been designed using Microsoft
Windows XP guidelines. That means
that you’ll continue to benefit from a
user friendly interface that is familiar,
easy to learn and easy to teach.

NVivo is all about making the
impossible possible in your
research. And now with the
introduction of NVivo 8, the
possibilities are endless.

Upgrading to NVivo 8
NVivo 8 will be released in the first quarter of 2008. If your organization holds a current site license or qualifying software
maintenance plan at that time, then you’ll receive NVivo 8 free of charge. We’ll be announcing a cut off date for purchasing
a new maintenance plan and qualifying for a free upgrade in the coming weeks.
For those who don’t qualify for a free upgrade, special pricing will be available for those currently using QSR’s NVivo 7,
NVivo 2 and N6 (NUD*IST 6) software.
Stay tuned for more information about NVivo 8 features in the coming months. There is much more to be
revealed. www.qsrinternational.com

New website delivers unrivalled
support to researchers
Where else can you
access free resources
for qualitative
researchers, search a
calendar of upcoming
events in your region,
swap tips and
suggestions with QSR
software users, read
about user projects in
NVivo and download
free software?

That’s what’s on offer with QSR International’s new website – www.qsrinternational.com –
which went live in June 2007.
The radically overhauled site has a new
look and a range of innovative features
designed to cater for the diverse needs
of our software users around the world.
“Our website has always been critical to
the delivery of support an services to our
customers, and now it serves an even
greater function,” said QSR’s Marketing
Director, Karen Thomas.
“From the range of user projects and
large database of resource articles, to
round-the-clock purchasing options and
materials in different languages, it delivers
more information than ever before, yet is
easier to navigate and use.”
Virtually all of the existing website
features are still there, such as the ability

to download free thirty day software
trials, but there are more resources to
ensure prospective users can find out
everything they need to know about our
software – from who else is using it, to
what they are using it for and how to get
a project started.

The fact that our visitors spend an average
of almost five minutes browsing the site
(which is up to five times longer than
many comparable sites) showed the value
of the information it contained. It also
prompted QSR to upgrade the site with a
view to offering customers more.

Information where and when
you need it

“Our website has reflected the
tremendous growth of the Internet
as a tool for information,” Karen said.
“We wanted the new site to
recognize our expanding global
customer base and ensure visitors
had access to information when and
where they needed it, regardless of
their time zone.”

When QSR launched its original website in
2000 the company was one of the first in
Australia to introduce a true multi currency
system. Since then, the website has
grown rapidly in popularity, especially in
the past 18 months with figures showing
visitors to the website have increased by
over 70%.

Access the latest thinking and
search for training workshops

image to come

Another new function is the ability to
search or browse a huge range of
resource articles, from user projects and
case studies to the latest thinking on
qualitative research from independent
experts.
There’s also a complete list of QSR
training workshops which users can
register for online. That’s in addition to a
calendar of upcoming conferences, and
a new area where our users and training
attendees can provide us with their
feedback online.

Fine-tuning the site with
assistance from researchers
The new website now allows you to print
your own customized pricing and has an
online shop that accepts more currencies
than ever before. There’s also everything
you need to know about licensing and
purchasing our software, including the
ability to search for resellers.

Unrivalled support resources
We’ve also translated key company and
product information into Japanese and
Mandarin and the website contains our
widest range of support resources yet,
from a comprehensive question and
answer section, to animated software
tutorials and an area where users can
download the latest service packs.
The new website not only expresses
the unique QSR personality – but is

benchmarked against recognized
standards, follows international
accessibility guidelines and applies
strong functional design principles.
Getting started using QSR software is easy
and all you need to know about installing
and beginning to use the software is now
on one page. We’ve also updated the look
of our QSR Forum, which is the place
where our users go to share their advice,
tips and ideas.

In developing the website, QSR road
tested it first to gauge the response
from a cross section of website visitors.
A group of QSR software users and
researchers from academia, government,
and commercial organizations reviewed
the site and tested its functionality and
navigation.
“The feedback was very positive and
instrumental in fine-tuning the site,”
Karen said.

“It’s allowed us to develop and launch what is sure to be a
fantastic resource for not only new and existing customers, but
anyone with an interest in qualitative research.”

Qualitative Data Analysis
with NVivo
A book review
Qualitative Data Analysis with NVivo (Second Edition) Pat Bazeley; 2007; Sage
Publications Ltd

Pat Bazeley’s new book Qualitative Data Analysis with
NVivo, was launched in May 2007. Leonie Daws, from Kihi
Consultancies reviews it here.
Pat Bazeley’s credentials for
producing a ‘how to’ book, bringing
together the tasks of qualitative
data analysis and the software
program NVivo, are impeccable.
She writes as an experienced
researcher, a respected academic
with a long career in research
development and administration,
and arguably one of the most
experienced independent providers
of training in QSR’s software. It is
not surprising, then, that Qualitative
Data Analysis with NVivo is packed
with practical advice and helpful
hints while at the same time
being firmly grounded in a sound
theoretical understanding
of qualitative research.

The book takes the reader systematically
through the major tasks of starting a project,
making and managing data, connecting
ideas and taking stock of progress. It
goes beyond simple code and retrieve
approaches to data analysis to explore ways
of deepening analysis and building theory,
drawing on a range of methodological
contexts such as narrative and discourse
analysis. As a bonus we are also given the
story of Tom and Lyn Richards and the early
origins of the software.
Each chapter combines a theoretically
informed, but highly practical account of
the processes involved in that stage of
the data analysis process, with hands-on
instructions for using the appropriate tools
provided by NVivo. Typically the instructions
are accompanied by invaluable hints about
short cuts, alternative ways of proceeding,
or simply how to get going again if you get
stuck. A further strength of the presentation
is the inclusion of illustrations, drawn from
a range of diverse projects, to assist the
reader in making the transfer from the
theory to their own research project.

Then there are those timely warnings to
help us avoid those seemingly insignificant
pitfalls that can confuse or delay the
unsuspecting novice.
Qualitative Data Analysis with NVivo has
lots to offer both those who are new to
qualitative research and those who are
experienced researchers, but want some
support for making the move to working
with NVivo. Keep this book by you as you
journey with your data. It will give you the
prompt you need for a confident start as
well as a steadying hand to guide you as
you master unfamiliar components of the
software. And when your progress stalls,
as inevitably it will, you will find some fresh
insight or new way of tackling the task to
get you on your way once more. Highly
recommended for beginners and old hands,
and everyone in between.
Qualitative Data Analysis with NVivo can be
purchased online at

www.qsrinternational.com

Here’s what a reader has said about the book:
“I’ve been using the book all week, and I must say it’s one of the most helpful I’ve ever used. I’m currently coding the interviews (15 families
and 10 health professionals) as well as some of the medical records of kids. While I do feel that I’ve got a mountain of stuff to jump over,
NVivo and your book are making it a bit easier. I’m moving between doing some coding to get a feel for the data then coming back to your
book to get a feel for how you would approach the same thing. It seems to be working! ...I’m enjoying your book, and I really like your writing
style in it.”

In Their Own Words
From the QSR Newsletter, NSight Issue 32, July 2007

Researchers and those using QSR software describe their projects in their own words.

XSight: How well does it fit with qualitative
market research?
“My mission was simple. Learn entirely new software, analyse a huge amount of verbatim data (1250
detailed responses) and write a thorough report for my client all within three working days.”
Duncan Stuart is the managing director of New Zealand based market research consultancy, Kudos Organisational
Dynamics. In June 2007, Duncan used QSR’s XSight 2 software to examine stories from New Zealanders about their
discovery and perceptions of locally made films. The following is based on a paper from Duncan that recounts his
experience of using XSight and his general views on software and its fit with the methods of qualitative research.
“I’m a market researcher. I do a mixture of
qualitative and quantitative research and
I’m a strong believer in avoiding numeric
data if we possibly can – not because
I dislike statistics (actually they can be
pretty cool,) but because I believe we lose
quite a lot in translation every time we
ask respondents to convert their complex
feelings into raw scores.”
“Tools like the now extinct SPSS
TextSmart were quite clever, but took a
very granular word-by-word approach
to the analysis of verbatim data. The
focus has been on words as the Legoblock of information, rather than on ideas
as a building block of understanding.
Technology can work pretty well at a
‘word’ level, but less well at the more
subjective, more nuanced ‘ideas’ level.”

2 	Problem driven. Going in with a line of
	 enquiry and testing your hypotheses
	 with the available evidence.
3 	Method-driven. Having a systematic
	 method of crunching your data: a
	 method which you’ve found tends to
	 yield nuggets of gold.
“I believe analysts tend to go into
most projects with all three modes in
operation. We tend to be open minded
enough to listen to the data – but we
have hypotheses also, based on wide
experience or based on the client brief.

We also have our methods, though for
most researchers these aren’t hyperformal. Behind most reports there’s a
mountain of transcripts arrayed around a
swivel chair.”
“It was in considering these different
approaches and in pondering the
strengths but also weaknesses of the text
analysis tools on my PC (I still have old
Text-Smart and also SPSS Text Analysis
for Surveys) that led me to XSight.”
(continued next page)

In his paper Duncan refers to a book by
Klaus Krippendorff called Content Analysis
– An Introduction to its Methodology 1. It
discusses three main ways of analysing
text. These are:
1 	Text-driven. Going in with a blank
	 sheet and letting the text tell its stories.

“XSight should be seen by users as an
on-screen environment for sorting
through loads of text data. Just as a
kitchen has pantry space, preparation
areas for chopping and dicing, a sink for
cleaning as well as the stove top, so too
XSight’s screen is split into distinct areas.
On the previous page I’ve included a
screen shot from my project.”
“In essence the screen structure is set up
so we can sort and prepare thoroughly
– keeping several viewpoints at once.”
“In my first two passes over the data I
took a very manual style of categorisation,
dragging and tagging as I went During
each pass I added more elements to the
Analysis Framework, and more Headings
within each Frame. This is why I like
computer assisted text analysis: the
process itself enables you to quickly
investigate the data, but also to adjust
your code frames as you go.”
“Years ago people used to use shoe boxes,
and throw slips of paper – verbatims
- into each shoe box which is not a very
adaptive style of working, especially when

you realise half way through the process
that you should have added a few more
boxes for themes that have emerged in
the data. Software enables us to work
both from a text-up and from
a framework-down angle.”
“Well, XSight enables us to execute
queries on the data. These are simple to
operate – like doing a find replace in a
Word document. So I did several of these
in quick succession using words like
‘shock’ and ‘recognise’ and ‘recogn’ and
‘homesick.’ The searches delivered half
a dozen suitable quotes with which to
populate the Heading, and subsequently
I found a few more while conducting a
similar exercise on several other themes
that were emergent in the data.”

“Top down. Bottom up. Text
driven. Problem Driven.
Process Driven. I found myself
alternating between these
approaches, each time being
rewarded with fresh insights
and a deeper understanding.”

Duncan Stuart is a Fellow of the Market Research Society of New Zealand
and managing director of Auckland based specialist research firm, Kudos
Organisational Dynamics.
Kudos devotes much of its time and revenue to supporting a volunteer
school in Siem Reap, Cambodia - which Kudos helped build in 2005. It’s run
by Svay Savong, a 25 year old man who has devoted his life to giving local
kids a head start. The school is a modest three classroom affair with five
teachers - and of course it is the students who make the place magic. They
are enthusiastic and eager to learn English and Japanese - language skills
that will give them a passport to employment in the region which, thanks to
Angkor Wat attracts 1.4 million tourists a year.

“From a methodological point of view I
think the software definitely enhanced
my capacity to do a thorough, thoughtful
job. From a user point of view (and here
the subject I was studying surely helped,)
I found the process to be engaging and
enjoyable and far less frazzling than the
classic quallie process of having printed
material scattered all around my working
space and me hunting high and low for
that ‘killer quote’.”
“Going back to the kitchen metaphor, I
felt I had done my preparation thoroughly;
everything was chopped and diced, sorted
and organised. Better still, the workspace
remained clean and clear: the sign of a
skilled chef.”
Duncan Stuart
June 8th, 2007.

Chronic poverty research: what relevance NVivo?
For the chronically poor, poverty is not simply about having low
income: it is about multiple deprivations – hunger, malnutrition,
dirty drinking water, lack of education, having no access to health
services, social isolation and exploitation. The chronically poor
experience this deprivation over many years, often over their
entire lives, and usually pass the poverty on to their children.

What is chronic poverty?
Chronic poverty is not just a concept developed
by researchers or policy-makers. As the quote
above suggests, people in poor communities
have many ways of distinguishing between
different types of poverty.
This ‘other half’ of the poor are the least likely
to benefit from contemporary national and
international development efforts. If chronic
poverty is to be addressed, specially targeted
policies need to be designed and policymakers convinced to implement them.
High quality research is vital in order to
influence policy-makers and qualitative work
clearly has much to offer, but if it is to be
taken as seriously as quantitative data,
rigorous data collection and analysis are
essential. It is here that NVivo can be of
service to chronic poverty research.

Who are the CPRC?
The Chronic Poverty Research Centre (CPRC)
is an international partnership of universities,
research institutes and non government
organizations funded by the UK’s Department
for International Development.

As an independent research centre, the CPRC
aims to create knowledge that contributes
to both the speed and quality of poverty
reduction, with a focus on assisting those who
are trapped in poverty, particularly in subSaharan Africa and South Asia.
The CPRC is committed to understanding
poverty as a dynamic phenomenon – exploring
changes over time and developing an
enhanced understanding of the reasons
for change. In this quest, the CPRC is very
interested in combining qualitative and
quantitative research methods. It is through
this innovative approach that the CPRC
believes that possible escape routes from
chronic poverty will be revealed and a greater
understanding gained of the strategies that
are employed by chronically poor people
themselves to escape poverty.
To date the CPRC has supported a significant
volume of work on panel data and quantitative
analysis, but less on qualitative work. To move
forward the CPRC needed to build its capacity
to undertake and analyze qualitative research.

First steps in using NVivo
As a first step, a training workshop was held
in Toubab Dialao, Senegal, in December 2006
for partners of the Chronic Poverty Research
Centre. The workshop focused on the use of
life histories. It was organized by IED Afrique
in Dakar for the CPRC and brought together
poverty researchers from 11 countries
(Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, India,
Nepal, Niger, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda
and the UK).
NVivo 7 was introduced to all 40 participants,
and of these, 25 elected to learn the software
in greater depth in a two day session. This

session was led by Didier Dupont, University
of Montreal, Canada and Peter Davis, Bath
University, UK and was conducted in both
French and English.
On the first day, everything was done
to minimize the time between the initial
presentation of the software and getting the
participants to use it themselves. This meant
that they were quickly reassured of the userfriendliness of NVivo. Although some were quite
nervous to start with, their fears were quickly
allayed. The steps necessary for creating a
project (creation of documents, importing life
histories, classification and coding of material,
creating annotations, memos, etc.) were
covered first and, by the end of the first day,
everyone was keen to learn more about how to
use NVivo.
The CPRC is particularly interested in using
NVivo to foster international collaboration and
also to combine the use of both quantitative
and qualitative data. This made it necessary to
highlight some particular aspects of NVivo 7.
• The scope for team work was important.
	 Researchers from different countries will be
	 working together on a comparative project.
	 They will need to share some of their data,
	 the life histories they have collected, their
	 hypotheses and their analysis, and to move
	 forward together using a shared theoretical
	 framework. In particular it was important
	 to learn how to merge projects, both data
	 and conceptual categories. In this way all
	 can benefit from the data and analyses of
	 their colleagues who are working elsewhere,
	 whilst preserving the integrity of their
	 project, according to their preferences and
	 as applicable to their particular context.

• In this multi-team environment, it is
	 particularly useful to be able to compare the
	 coding produced by two researchers on the
	 same interviews.
• Because of the desire to triangulate
	 qualitative and quantitative data, it was
	 important to emphasize the advantages of
	 using attributes. Using attributes will enable
	 questions such as: ‘How does a respondent
	 from a region with a particular economic
	 profile perceive their poverty?’ That is, we
	 not only know what type of region they
	 come from, but also their view on poverty.
	 The typology of regions would be devised
	 using the results of quantitative surveys.
• Above all, it was important that the
	 participants grasped the importance of
	 matrices in NVivo 7. There was a jubilant
	 exclamation (Wow!) when the results
	 of a matrix were seen for the first time.
	 Immediately, everyone could see the
	 importance of classifying and coding the
	 material, and appreciated the power of the
	 tool, and the possibilities in analyzing their
	 research which were now open to them. It
	 is here then that hypotheses can emerge or
	 be validated.
The success of this workshop was due not
only to the excellent logistical arrangements
made by IED Afrique (under the direction of
Bara Guèye), but because of the way in which
the theoretical background of working with
life histories was covered in advance of using
the software. In addition, the enthusiasm and
patience of the participants made this both
a productive and very humorous workshop.
Because the CPRC partners could all come
together and in the future share their NVivo
projects, they knew that they would not be
isolated in the forthcoming challenging work,
and also that they would not lose control of
their research. NVivo would allow them to

remain its master, not constrict them, but
make deeper analysis possible. They
understood that this data-processing tool
would respect their data, and enable them
to use it even more effectively.

“The workshop was an
excellent forum for researchers
from different countries and
research backgrounds to
discuss opportunities for
enhancing the speed and
quality of oral testimony
analysis in order to influence
both national and global policies
in tackling the chronic poverty
phenomenon.”

The future
NVivo is already very much in use by the CPRC.
A large study is underway in rural Bangladesh,
where 280 life histories have been collected
and are currently being analyzed. This
qualitative element of the project is not simply
a follow-on or supplement to quantitative
surveys and analysis, but has been fully
integrated and sequenced to enable a more
holistic understanding of chronic poverty and
its dynamics.
The next step is to use this experience and
undertake similar qualitative-quantitative
studies in other countries. An ambitious
project is currently being designed in which
a combination of methods will be used to
compare countries, particularly in terms of
past and possible future patterns of upward
mobility out of poverty. In 2007, two pilot
projects are planned in Kenya and India, with
further studies likely in Senegal, Burkina Faso,
Tanzania, Mozambique, Nepal and Uganda.
So, yes, NVivo is highly relevant to chronic
poverty research.
