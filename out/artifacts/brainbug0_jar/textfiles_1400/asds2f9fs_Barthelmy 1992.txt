A choice process model is discussed.
This model retains the sequential
nature of Tversky’s
Elimination
by Aspect (EBA) heuristics: subjects are assumed to split the set of alternatives
into
increasingly
smaller subsets until a one-element
set is obtained. It differs from EBA in the way
these splits are performed.
We assume that: (i) the process cannot be reduced to elimination,
(ii)
subjects may process several attributes
at the same time, (iii) at a given level of the selection/
elimination
process, the alternatives
may be examined relative to several attribute
groupings.
The results of an experiment
supporting
our model are presented.

According to Simon (e.g. 1979), a human decision maker is able to
exhibit rationality within the limits of his own representation
of the
decision situation (see also Klein 1983; Payne 1982). Several choice
models, involving this concept of bounded rationality,
have been put
forward and tested under various conditions (Montgomery
and Svenson 1976; Svenson 1983). Many models for the choice of one (or more>
stimuli characterized
by several attributes have been designed. These
models are deterministic
or probabilistic.
Deterministic
models primarily deal with the study of decision rules that may account for the
decision process in terms of the selection of information
and the
integration
of selected information.
Non-deterministic
models mainly
focus on decision outcomes and generally try to account for a set of
decisions rather than describing the fine processes of selection and

of information.
Since this paper is concerned
with the
deterministic
point of view, we shall emphasize these kinds of rules.
In the case of a binary choice between multi-attribute
alternatives
these rules or models include: (a) the maximin and maximax rules
(Dahlstrand
and Montgomery
1984); (b) the dominance
rule (Lee
1971); (cl the conjunctir>e (Coombs
1964) and the disjunctir’e rules
(Dawes 1964); (dl the majority rule (May 1954; Russo and Dosher
19831, and the weighted set of dimensions rule (Huber 1979); (e) the
choice by greatest attructir’eness rule (Montgomery
and Svenson 1976);
(f) the lexicographic
rule (Fishburn
19741, the minimum difference
lexicographic
rule (Montgomery
and Svenson 1976), and the Iexicographic semi order rule (Tversky
1969); (g) the addition of utility
dqyer-ences rule (Tversky
19691, and the sequential accumulation of
dqyerences
rule (Aschenbrenner
et al. 1984); (h) the moring basis
heuristics (Mullet 1985; Barthelemy
and Mullet 1986).
Most of these rules arc well known. According to the dominance
rule, one alternative is chosen over the other if it is better on at least
one attribute and not worse on all other attributes. The weighted sets
of dimensions rule is a variant of the majority rule: the decision maker
divides the set of attributes into two subsets. Subset A, (A,) contains
all the attributes that speak for s, (s,). These two sets are weighted
and s, is chosen whenever A, has more weight than A I. According to
the lexicographic
rule, the chosen alternative has the highest value on
an attribute judged as the most important; in the case of a tie on this
attribute,
the decision is based on the second most important
attribute,
and so on. The lexicographic
semiorder
rule is like the
lexicographic
rule with the additional
assumption
that for the first
attribute, there is a difference threshold. If the difference between the
evaluation
of one alternative
and the other is greater
than this
threshold,
then the highest alternative
is chosen. If not, the second
attribute is used, and so on, as in the lexicographic
rule (i.e., without
difference
thresholds).
The minimum difference
lexicographic
rule is
obtained as a generalization:
each attibute is associated with a difference threshold and the differences
on each attribute are lexicographitally compared to the corresponding
threshold.
The moving basis heuristics coordinates
four types of rules: lexicographic, threshold,
conjunctive.
and disjunctive.
It is built on the
principle that the dominance rule is used as the major one and that all
the other rules are only used to obtain a dominance
structure,
as

quickly as possible (Montgomery
1983). For further discussion of the
model and the principles
it involves, the reader
is referred
to
Barthelemy
and Mullet (1986, 1989). Here we only need to know that
a given realization
of the process can be summarized
in a single
formula, which we call a choice polynomial:
L” + LF + FM4.

(1)

Here, {L), {L, F}, {F, M) are the sets of attributes examined successively by a given expert; in other words they are the successive points
of view the expert uses; the exponents denote a difference threshold.
The polynomial reads:
If there is a difference
of at least three
alternative.
then this alternative is chosen.

levels

in L favouring

one

Or else,
If there is a difference of at least one level on L (exponent omitted in
this case) and a difference
of at least one level in F favouring one
alternative,
then this alternative is chosen.
Or else,
If there is a difference of at least one level on F and a difference of at
least four levels in M favouring one alternative,
then this alternative is
chosen.
Or else, there

is a non-choice.

Note that this model may be viewed as a generalization
of the
minimum difference
lexicographic
rule (e.g., L3 + F4 + M”), the lexicographic semiorder
rule (e.g., L” + F + M), the lexicographic
rule
(e.g., L + F + M), the conjunctive
rule (e.g., LF”), the strict dominance rule (LFM), and the majority rule (LF + LM + FM).
Other models deal with the choice of one stimulus out of several.
The most well known is the Elimination by Aspect (EBA) model
(Tversky 1972a,b). In the deterministic
version of this model (see Gati
1986; Payne et al. 1988; Svenson 1983) the alternatives
are described
by attributes; one (and only one> attribute is selected, together with a
threshold
value. Each alternative
is then examined relative to this

<-----Page 3----->attribute. Alternatives
with a value on this attribute that falls below
the threshold
are eliminated.
A second attribute with an associated
threshold is then selected and the remaining alternatives
are considered relative to this new attribute
and threshold.
This leads to a
second elimination and the process continues until a single alternative
(the selected one) is obtained.

Selection

by aspects and moving basis

In this article we discuss an alternative
model (the selection by
aspects model) that retains the sequential
nature of the EBA. Here
subjects split the set of alternatives
into increasingly smaller subsets
until a one-element
set is obtained. Our model differs from the EBA
in the way these splits arc made. We assume the following:
(1) The process cannot be reduced
to eliminations.
It also involves
selections as a function of circumstances
(i.e. experimental
design,
task).
(21 [Conjunctive
rules]: at each level of the selection/elimination
process, subjects can process several attributes
at the same time
(and not only one as the EBA assumes).
(31 At each level of the selection/elimination
process, the alternatives may be examined relative to several groupings of attributes.
A concrete example may help to clarify the differences between the
two models. Consider
some hotels with restaurants
described
by
several attributes in some specialized guide. These attributes are: the
price of the menu, the price of the rooms, the quality of the service,
the noise, the quality of the accommodation,
and so on. Assume a
person has to choose one of these hotels. According to EBA heuristics, this person will select an attribute, for instance the price of the
menu, consider a threshold
on this attribute
and eliminate
all the
hotels that fall below this threshold on this attribute. Then a second
attribute with threshold is selected and the elimination
process goes
on until one and only one hotel remains.
In our model, the subject first examines all the alternatives
under
consideration
and makes selections (and/or
eliminations)
on the basis
of aspects (i.e. attribute
values) considered
as favourable
(or unfavourable).
For example, a hotel may be selected, in this first stage,

<-----Page 4----->J.P. Barth&my,

E. Mullet / A model of selection by aspects

5

because its menu is cheap or because the quality of the service is very
good and the rooms are cheap,. . . In the second stage the remaining
alternatives
are examined,
with more stringent requirements.
This
continues until one and only one hotel remains at the end of the
process. The way in which the subject proceeds may be expressed as
follows:
(1)Hh+B4Dh+B4H4+C6~4+C4~5,
(2) H6 + B4H’ + C5D6
(3) B4H” + C4Hb + E4;ih.
H, B, C, D, E are the attributes and these rules must be interpreted
in the following way. In the first stage, each hotel having a value on
attribute H that is at least 6 was selected, as well as the hotel whose
value is at least 4 on B and 6 on D, etc. In the second stage, the
number of groupings of attributes under consideration
decreases, but
the values of the thresholds increase. In the third stage, the fact that
the value of H is at least 6 no longer guarantees selection..
.
Hence, EBA is a special case of our selection by aspects model. For
instance, EBA process may be expressed as follows:

(1) H’,
(2) HhD5,
(3) H”D5Ch.
Although EBA only pre-supposes
a coordinated
use of two types of
rules: lexicography and threshold, our model involves two other types
of rules: conjunction
and disjunction. Thus, it appears as an extension
of the moving basis heuristics
as described
above to the case of
choices among many alternatives.

The process
A ‘polynomial’ such as H6 + B4Dh + B4H4 + C”D4 + C4H5 can be
seen as an algebraic representation
of the process described below
(see fig. 1).

of selection

If at
least one aspect is lower than the corresponding

another

several iterations,
the subject selects the stimulus or he/she
eliminates it (box 61.

This model acts as a decision heuristic in the sense of Groner et al.
(1983) and Huber (1986). It is built on the basis that the dominance
principle is the major one and that all the other rules are only used to
obtain (as quickly as possible) a dominance
structure (Montgomery
1983). Three basic principles are involved in the model:
(1) A parsimony principle. Due to his/her
inability to process the
whole data set, the subject extracts some subsets whose magnitudes
are small enough to be compatible
both with human short-range
storage abilities (there is no intermediate
storage in long term memory) and with human computational
abilities (see Aschenbrenner
and
Kasubek 1978; Johnson and Payne 1985).
(2) A reliability / warrantability principle. This principle operates, in
some ways, as the reverse of the preceding one (De Hoog and Van de
Wittenboer
1986;Payne et al. 1988). Concerned
by reliability (socially
as well as personally), the subject extracts from the data set a subset
that is large enough and composed
in such a way as to appear
meaningful
(evaluations
on several attributes,
conjunctive
rules). A
selection
is made if and only if the evaluations
are large enough
(threshold
rules; see Adelbratt
and Montgomery
1980; Huber 1983;
McAllister et al. 1979; Montgomery
1983; Ranyard and Crozier 1983).
(3) A decidubility principle. Concerned
with the need to achieve a
choice in almost all cases, the subject extracts subsets of data in a way
flexible enough to obtain a decision almost every time and on relatively short notice. This decision corresponds
to minimal conflict (see
Huber 1986; Klayman 1982: 39; Montgomery
1983; Svenson 1979:
106-107).
Applying such a heuristic is generally consistent with a low probability of error and a small magnitude
for errors that may occur
(Stillwell et al. 1981). One reason for this may be that the attributes
are correlated
(Vicariant Process, Einhorn et al. 1979: 466). Applying
this heuristic is also consistent
with a high probability
of context
effects such as those found by Eagle (19881 with binary choices
(variation
of the weight of attributes
according
to the difference
between the two objects on these attributes).
Moreover
it is worth
noting that although the information processing is assumed to follow a
flow chart, such a representation
should not be considered
literally.
The sequence of events is surely not strictly determined.
Rather, it

corresponds
to stochastic tendencies.
As in the Aschenbrenner
et al.
(1984) model, the sequence of selecting attributes may fluctuate.
Fig. 2 represents
an application
of the heuristics.
In the first
polynomial occurring in the example below {H}; {B, D}; {B, H}; (C, D};
{C, H) are the sets of attributes one subject considered successively; in
other words, they are the successive points of view that the subject

uses. The as are evaluations (aspects) of the stimulus on H, B, D, C.
The numbers 6, 4, and 5 are the corresponding
threshold
values.
Clearly, in this example, the model presupposes
a process that includes both interdimensional
and intradimensional
strategies.
This
seems compatible with many previous observations
(e.g. Bettman and
Jacoby 1976; Ranyard and Crozier 1983).
The polynomial: H” + B4D6 + B4H4 + C6D4 + C4H5, with the interpretation
given above, can be expressed as a formula that summarizes the first step of the selection/elimination
process. The whole
process itself may be represented
as a sequence (P,, . . . , Pm> of polynomials, such that each monom of Pi+1 is obtained by adding one or
more attributes
and thresholds,
or by increasing
degrees on some
monom of P,, or by considering
new conjunctions
of attributes with
thresholds (cf. Appendix).

Illustration

In the experiments
we performed,
subjects were required to select, or eliminate,
some of the stimuli. The selection process was repeated as many times as the subject
wished, until one and only one stimulus remained.
If the deterministic
version of EBA applies, it should be possible to account for
selections, for each subject, on step one, with one and only one attribute. The stimuli
that are selected at this first step are those that go beyond some threshold associated
with the attribute in question. Moreover,
it should be possible to account for the
selections processed after the second step with exactly two attributes (and thresholds)
used conjunctively.
On the other hand, if. the process is more complex, and if our model applies, then
it is impossible to account for selections, for each subject, on the basis of one, and
only one, attribute. Rather, several attributes need to be considered
as of the first
step.

aged 25 to 42, who tend to spend

Material
The material consisted of 36 sheets. Each described a hotel according to certain
attributes. These attributes include, in addition to the name of the establishment:
(A)
the scale of prices of the menus (for example from FF80 to FF160); (B) the

<-----Page 9----->J.P. Barthklemy, E. Mullet / A model

quality/price
ratio of the restaurant;
(Cl the quality of the decor; (D) the scale of
room prices; (El the cost of brcakfest; (F) the number of rooms; (G) the quality of
service; (H) the distance from the tourist bureau; (I) the accessability of the establishmcnt; and (J) its noise level. Each of the ten attributes (from A to J) can have six
values.
Procedure

Subjects were read the following instructions (in French): ‘You have just arrived in
an area with a major tourist attraction. You plan to stay there for some time. You go
to the tourist bureau to get a list of hotels with restaurants.
The list you receive is the
one I will give to you now. It includes 36 hotels. Each establishment
is described by:
its name, file scale of prices of the menus..
and its noise level. To select one hotel
that looks attractive, proceed in the following way: first, examine each sheet scparately, then put the sheets that correspond
to hotels that seem acceptable
into this
box. Second, r-e-examine the selected sheets and put the most attractive ones into the
box, etc... You may repeat these steps as often as you like.’
Three experimental
conditions wcrc used. In the first, the subjects (N = 5) merely
performed
the above task. Then they had to reexamine the sheets corresponding
to
hotels selected in the first step. For each selcctcd sheet they had to give the aspects
(e.g. H, A, G) leading up to their selection. In the second, the subjects (N = 5) were
required, after the selection, to specify the aspects they had used. In the third, the
subjects (N = 5) were required to write down, at the moment of elimination,
the
reasons for eliminating hotels. Our hypothesis specifically focuses on the amount and
the diversity of information
used, or expressed, at each step.

anulysis

A simple example is sufficient to understand
the way polynomials arc computed.
Consider table 1. The columns represent hypothetical
hotels, a to i. The letters A. B,
C. D represent
attributes. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are the attribute values.
Assume that c, d and h were selected in the first stage. All these stimuli have a
high value on A in common (3, 4, 4). Is ‘monom’ A4 sufficient to explain a part of the
choices? In other words: is a stimulus selected each time it has a 4 on A? The answer
is YES since none of the eliminated stimuli present such a value. Do we actually need
value 4, rather than value 3, on A? Here the answer is NO, since stimulus g, with

value 3 on A, was not selected. Hence monom A4 explains the choices of d and h.
What about c? c has a value of 3 on A and 4 on B. Does A’B4 suffice to explain
choices? Here the answer is YES. The fourth question is: do we need 4 on B? The
answer is YES (since i was not selected). The fifth question is: do we need 3 on A?
The answer is YES (since f was not selected). Thus, the polynomial A4 + A’B4 is
sufficient to explain all the choices. This polynomial will be called an equation of the
selection {c, d, h). A more formal point of view is developed in the Appendix, where
this notion is defined and where a characterization
of selections accepting such an
equation is provided.
An experimental
program to compute selection equations
has been written in
Turbo-Pascal
(cf. Barthelemy
and Mullet 1987). It runs on MS-DOS compatible
material. In the spirit of Tversky’s original EBA, the corresponding
algorithm first
searches
for monoms reduced
to a single attribute
and as a second priority for
polynomials
with a minimal number of monoms.
For instance
assume that the
program computes the polynomial: Hh + B4Dh + B4H4 + ChD4 + C4Hs. This means
that:
(a) There is only one dimension which is able to explain selections
conjunctively with others.
(b) Within this case, there is no way to explain all selections
conjunctions
of at most two attributes.

Note that our program only computes
one polynomial
among many possible
(however, the equation of a selection is unique when the subject has to select from the
enormous set of all possible descriptions
of stimuli by the attributes). But this point is
irrelevant here: the fact that the program finds a polynomial with several monoms as
a selection equation, and, among these, monoms with several attributes, supports the
hypothesis that subjects, at a given level of the selection process, proceed with several
attributes at the same time, and that at the same level of the selection process, the
alternatives
may be examined relative to several groupings of attributes, even if the
same selection can be explained by several different polynomials.
Analysis of polynomials

Table 2 presents all the equations on the first selection for the 15 subjects.
For subjects 2, 9, 10, 11 the polynomial obtained is rather simple: for subjects 2, 9,
11 it is reduced to one monom (containing a single attribute for subjects 2 and 11).
Subject 10 selected each stimulus with an attribute value 2 3 on B. For all other
subjects the polynomials are rather complex and display strategies involving the use of
conjunctive
and disjunctive
rules. Nevertheless
these polynomials
are quite easy to
interpret. For instance, by simple algebra manipulation,
the polynomial of subject 10
may be written:
B”(E’+

G” + H” + D4H’)

+ B”F”.

It may be interpreted
as: each time the quality/price
ratio is at least average; and
either the breakfast is very cheap, or the quality of the service is very good, or the

3, 7, I, 3. I, I, I, 2, I, I
selections). In particular monoms with two attributes explain a third of the selections.
For the whole set of IS subjects the selections explained by simples monoms are by
far a minority.
Table 3 presents equations for the second sclcctions.
For subjects 2 and I I, the
polynomials become more complex. In the first step, subject 2 sclcctcd all the stimuli
with an average lcvcl on B. Now this subject bccomcs much more demanding;
either
an average level on B does not suffice alone any more (B’DJJ3), or the evaluation on
B has to bc better (BJH’). Further a new monom (D’) S.Y~Z.Sto appear. All the
hotels with cheap rooms (Di) have an avcragc quality/price
ratio (B3). Thus, D5 may
bc read as B”D’. A similar situation occurs frcqucntly for the polynomials in table 2.
In the first step, subject Y seemed to apply a strict conjunctive rule. Now this subject
exhibits disjunctive rules (BJHS + C”J’) together with compensatory
effects (B3H” +
BJHL). Subject 1 again shows the greatest number of simple monoms. Each monom
explains respectively 3, 3. I, I. 1, 1. 3. 2 sclcctions.

Table 4 gives rationales for selection as stated by the subjects cithcr at the end of
the cxpcrimcnt
(3a). .or during the cxpcrimcnt
(3b).
In each cast the majority of subjects gave multiple, not ncccssarily overlapping,
rationales. It is worth noting that subject 2, who previously appeared as an unidimensional subject is also the subject who gives the most unidimensional
rationales (8, 21
times). Similar remarks apply to subject 9.

Discussion
Right from the first step of the selection process, recourse to terms
with several attributes
(mostly two) is needed to account for the
behaviour of a majority of subjects, despite the fact that data processing tends to minimize the number of attributes.
Moreover,
for a
majority of subjects, right from the first step, it is necessary
to
consider shifts in points of view (they are indicated by the monoms
occurring in an equation).
At the second step, the characteristics
of
the obtained polynomials
remain the same. Furthermore,
when writing motives for each selection (elimination),
subjects spontaneously
consider such shifts of point of view and generally mention several
attributes
each time. It is worth noting that there is no difference
between the structures
of the statements
whether made during the
selection process or a posteriori.

<-----Page 14----->The EBA model apparently
fails to account for the selection
behaviour of a majority of subjects. Only two subjects seem to implement such a simple model on the first step. Accounting for all other
subjects calls for a more complex model at each selection level in
which both conjunctive and disjunctive rules occur.
Given the way polynomials computation
has been programmed,
and
except for two subjects there is no way to account for all the selections
and all the eliminations
with a single attribute
Generally,
subjects
deal disjunctively with many (groupings of) attributes. This evidence
runs counter the deterministic
version of EBA heuristics. Moreover,
except the aforementioned
subjects, it is impossible to explain all the
selections or eliminations
with a disjunctive one dimensional
model:
conjunctions
of two attributes are needed by all other subjects. However, just a few attributes occur in each conjunction (2 and exceptionally 3). Recall however that the program
gives priority to small
monoms.
The alternative model put forward here provides an explanation
of
subjects’ selection behaviour (and their justifications).
Presented with
a varied set of options, and asked to process a first selection, the
subjects do not seem to follow a fixed selection/elimination
criterion.
Initially they probably
examine the strong points (and the weak
points) of each option. If a given option appears to be a feasible
candidate,
then it is selected.
This does not mean that subjects’
behaviour is solely determined
by the design of the data. A particular
attribute is not necessarily significant for a particular subject. Moreover, a high value (low value) for one attribute does not imply the
selection (elimination)
of the corresponding
option even when this
attribute seems significant to the subject. Rather there are interactions between the characteristics
of the subject (order of attractiveness
of the attributes) and the characteristics
of the task (observed designs).
An option may be selected because it has an attractive value on an
‘important’
attribute.
But another
option could also be selected,
despite the fact that its value may be low on this attribute, because
this option has a system of high values, with compelling attractiveness.
In the first case, the subject forces the structure of the process. In the
second case the design of data appealed to the subject. As a result,
the global behaviour is quite complex, but may be taken into account
in the model. This model is able to account for both shifts ill points of
view (disjunctions),
compensatory
effects and conjunctive
effects.

<-----Page 15----->However, this flexible model is not irrefutable:
two subjects clearly
demonstrate
the use of a fixed, permanent
criterion at the first step of
the selection process.

Selection polynomials:

A formal approach

Consider an expert faced with the following task: select a subset from a stimulus
set S = (s,, . , s,~}.described by attributes
X,,
, X,,, taking values on ordinal scales.
The data may be summarized
in a stimulus matrix Z: having rows corresponding
to
to X,.
. X,,, the coefficient r,, of’ the matrix

being the rank of stimulus s, with respect to attribute X,. The stimuli arc point wise

A sekction of some stimuli from S is simply a subset T of S. Such a subset is said
to bc po/yr~ominl
on 1 if and only if there exists a C-polynomial
P such that, for each

polynomial subsets. It is easy to obtain:

In particular, if T is polynomial, then there exists a reduced C-polynomial
P such
that, for each stimulus s,, we have s, E T, if and only if P 5 M(i). Such a polynomial
deserves the name of: equation of T. Notice that such an equation is not, in general,
unique.
Now, we define a selection /elimination
sequence as a sequence
CT,, Tz, . , T,,,) of
subsets of S such that T ,+, c T,, for i = 1,. . , m - 1. A selection /elimination
sequence (T,, T,, . . , T,,,) is said to be polynomial
on C if and only if there exists a
sequence (P,, P,,

Polynomial
selection/

sequences
are those sequences
that may be
explained by the use of the selection by aspects heuristics. In view of this, we have to
obtain a characterization
of such sequences. This is done by Proposition 3. To achieve
this, we need to consider the restriction CT of the stimulus matrix E to a subset T of
S : ET = CT,,: s, E T, 1 2 j up).

Proof.

If 7 is polynomial on Z., then’for each i, 1 2 i < m, T, + ,, is polynomial on ET.
Conversely, according to the transitivity of I , it is sufficient to prove that for T’ 2 T’,
if T is polynomial and if T’ is polynomial on C,, then there exist polynomials
P and
P’ such that PIP’,
P is an equation of T and P’ is an equation of T’. Consider an
equation P of T and a polynomial Q that defines T’ on E,-. Consider the polynomial
Q’ = P + Q. Reduce it by supressing the monom M’ in Q each time there is a monom
M such that M’ divides M. That is, keep in Q’ the maximal monoms according to the
order relation of divisibility. Let P’ be the thus obtained
polynomial.
From the
definition of the preorder
I : P I P’. Hence the result.
