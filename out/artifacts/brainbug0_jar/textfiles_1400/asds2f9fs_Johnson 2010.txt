A great deal of cognitive, affective, and behavioral regulation occurs outside people’s
awareness and control. For example, encountering a member of a social group automatically activates traits associated with that group and elicits trait-consistent behaviors in
observers (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999). Similarly, evaluations of objects within one’s environment, like a person or event, may also occur automatically and without deliberation.
Such evaluations, labeled implicit attitudes, result from processes that consume few mental resources and are unintentional, unconscious, and uncontrolled. Although a large body
of research concerning implicit processes exists in the social-cognitive psychology literature, organizational scholars are beginning to recognize their importance as well (Haines
& Sumner, 2006). For example, implicit measures have been recommended for assessing
personality (Bing, LeBreton, Davison, Migetz, & James, 2007), racial bias (Ziegert &
Hanges, 2005), leadership perceptions (Lord, Brown, Harvey, & Hall, 2001), trait affectivity (Rosen, Akirmak, & Johnson, 2008), and organizational identification (Lane & Scott,
2007), among other phenomena. These recommendations are reasonable given that many
characteristics of a typical workplace (e.g., high cognitive load and routinization) are ones
that amplify the impact of implicit processes and attitudes.
Given the need for more research on implicit processes, Wittenbrink and Schwarz’s
Implicit Measures of Attitudes is a useful resource for organizational scholars interested in
measuring implicit attitudes and associative knowledge. This edited volume has 11 chapters with contributions from 23 academics. The introductory chapter provides an overview
of explicit and implicit measures and discusses potential benefits of the latter (e.g., a
means for assessing attitudes that respondents are unable or unwilling to report). Although
it is a good primer, anyone who is familiar with implicit processes and the techniques used
to measure them will not be surprised by the material presented in this chapter.
The remainder of the book is divided into two sections. The first section introduces
readers to various types of implicit measures and how they are administered and interpreted. Several techniques entail the collection of reaction time data. For example, Lane,
Banaji, Nosek, and Greenwald (chap. 3) describe the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a
commonly used reaction time measure, and summarize evidence for its reliability and validity. The authors also provide a how-to guide so that readers can construct their own IAT.
Wittenbrink (chap. 2) discusses implicit measures that use priming techniques. For
example, evaluative priming involves participants identifying the affective valence (e.g.,
pleasant vs. repulsive) of target words or pictures following exposure to an attitude object
prime. Primes that facilitate faster responding to pleasant (vs. repulsive) targets indicates
that respondents are favorably (vs. unfavorably) disposed to the attitude object. This
method could easily be applied to work-based attitudes. For example, employees could be
primed to think about their supervisor before judging the valence of target words. Faster
reaction times when responding to positively valenced words would indicate a more favorable attitude toward one’s supervisor.

Two chapters discuss the use of physiological and neural imaging measures for measuring implicit attitudes. Ito and Cacioppo (chap. 5) summarize research that used techniques
such as functional MRI, electroencephalography, and electromyography to assess visceral
reactions to attitude objects. The authors provide readers with a basic understanding of
how the various techniques function and the pros and cons of each. Olsson and Phelps
(chap. 6) discuss the neural correlates of social evaluations and the inferences that can
(and cannot) be made from neural imaging.
Chapter 4, by Vargas, Sekaquaptewa, and von Hippel, may be the most useful chapter
in the first section because they discuss ‘‘low-tech’’ implicit measures that require nothing
more sophisticated than a pencil and paper. The authors summarize evidence showing that
non–reaction-time-based implicit measures are capable of assessing the content and accessibility of implicit attitudes. Low-tech implicit measures may also indicate the extent to
which implicit attitudes influence people’s perceptions and cognition. Examples of such
measures include word- and sentence-completion tasks, in which respondents fill in missing letters or words to form complete words or sentences. The authors discuss the use of
these measures to assess implicit attitudes, associative knowledge (e.g., trait-group membership pairings), and self-concept (e.g., self-esteem), many of which can be adapted for
use in organizational settings.
The chapters in the second section of the book assess what is known about implicit
measures, present theoretical controversies, and identify issues requiring further research.
De Houwer and Moors (chap. 7) tackle the question ‘‘What are implicit measures?’’ Their
answer is that implicit measures are measurement outcomes that reflect to-be-measured
constructs that exist by way of automatic processes. The authors then describe the features
of automatic processes (e.g., uncontrollable, unintentional, and efficient) and how they
can be assessed. This chapter, which clears up confusion concerning the meaning of implicitness, really ought to have been at the beginning of the book rather than the middle.
As a foil to the earlier Lane et al. chapter (chap. 3), Wentura and Rothermund (chap. 8)
question whether the IAT actually tests associations. Instead, they argue that the IAT
measures asymmetries in the salience of the stimuli that are included in the IAT, and they
present empirical evidence consistent with a salience asymmetry account. Organizational
scholars who use or plan to use the IAT will find this chapter beneficial.
Both Ferguson and Bargh (chap. 9) and Smith and Conrey (chap. 10) discuss the extent
to which implicit measures are context dependent. Although the traditional view is that
implicit measures are more stable than explicit measures, recent connectionist approaches
imply that implicit attitudes and other mental representations are reconstructed on the fly
on the basis of contextual factors. The two sets of authors review research that demonstrates that internal (e.g., goals and mood) and external (e.g., task instructions and social
group memberships) influences alter responses on implicit measures. Smith and Conrey
conclude their chapter with a helpful list of recommendations for thinking about and using
explicit and implicit measures.
In the final chapter, Gawronski and Bodenhausen (chap. 11) summarize many of the
controversies discussed in earlier chapters (e.g., the utility of physiological measures and
attitudes as stable vs. dynamic evaluations) and provide a detailed discussion of when significant correlations should (and should not) be expected between explicit and implicit

measures as well as correlations among different types of implicit measures. Throughout
the chapter, the authors highlight unresolved issues that require further attention.
Overall, Implicit Measures of Attitudes is a useful resource for anyone interested in
using implicit measures in their own research or simply learning more about such measures. The book might also be used for graduate-level courses in tests and measures or
research methods. Advantages of the book include chapters that are well written and
represent contributions from leading scholars in social and cognitive psychology. The
book also provides a balanced commentary that tempers the information presented with
an accurate understanding of what scores on implicit measures can (and cannot) tell us.
However, it has noteworthy disadvantages as well. First and foremost, the book’s emphasis seems to be on bringing readers up to speed on what implicit measures are and providing examples of some common techniques. Unfortunately, the examples do not provide
sufficient information on how to successfully develop and administer such measures. In
some cases, specific techniques are described in single sentences, which leaves questions
regarding the reliability and validity of the measures unanswered. Details on the actual
mechanics of implicit measures—outside of the IAT—would have been a welcome addition to this book. As a result, scholars who are interested in actually using implicit measures are left with the chore of tracking down the needed information themselves.
A second disadvantage is the paucity of figures in the text. Many of the implicit techniques described by the authors involve complex visual stimuli that would have been easier
to understand were they accompanied by a corresponding illustration. It is one thing to
explain how a visual prime looks, but it is quite another thing to show it. Readers would
have benefited from the latter.
A final disadvantage is that organizational scholars may not find some chapters useful.
For example, the two chapters on physiological and neural imaging measures are intriguing and provide a glimpse of what the future holds for attitude research, yet they are not
especially relevant for field research—at least until portable and affordable functional
MRIs become available! The same might also be said of the chapters on other implicit
measures that require sophisticated technology or the collection of reaction times. Such
data collection techniques are likely prohibitive in work settings.
Despite its limitations, Wittenbrink and Schwarz’s book would make an appropriate
addition to the arsenal of organizational scholars. Because explicit and implicit processes
underlie people’s attitudes and behaviors in work settings, more attention ought to be
directed at ways of assessing the latter. Wittenbrink and Schwarz’s book provides guidance in that direction.
