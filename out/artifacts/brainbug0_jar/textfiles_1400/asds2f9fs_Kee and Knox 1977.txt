Trust and suspicion appear to underlie
many social interactions. Thus it is not surprising that they occupy an important role in
various efforts to account for the stability or
instability of a wide variety of human relationships. One of the earliest systematic formulations of these concepts appeared in this
journal over a decade ago (cf. Deutsch, 1958).
Yet little progress has been made since then
toward a more satisfactory conceptualization
of trust and suspicion. This paper is devoted
to the examination of both the theoretical
and the methodological considerations relevant to the empirical study of trust and

suspicion.

Conceptual Considerations
Problems in defining and conceptualizing
and suspicion. Explicit definitions of
trust and suspicion are, on the one hand,
conspicuously scarce. On the other hand, a
diversity of terms is frequently used synonymously with trust and suspicion. Cooperation, faith, and confidence are often used

and suspicion.
are

Popular notions-however vague or unspecified-and more sophisticated notions of
trust and suspicion seem to enter into a
gamut of relationships ranging from the intrapersonal to the interpersonal, and from
primitive intertribal relationships to complex international contexts. However, the
precise connotations implied when the terms
trust and suspicion are employed in these
various instances are not identical from one
instance to the next. For example, a mother
is said to &dquo;trust&dquo; the baby-sitter just as a
parishioner is said to &dquo;trust&dquo; the priest during
confession. Similarly, the Akka pygmies of
Africa may be said to &dquo;trust&dquo; the neighboring
agricultural tribes in their silent trade relationships just as Britain may usually be said
to &dquo;trust&dquo; the United States in their political
and economic relationships. Yet the exact
notion of trust involved in each of these examples is different. If there is some thread
of commonality running through the range

<-----Page 2----->358
of such diverse applications, then it is necessary that adequate definitions attempt to
extract or specify the common dimensions or
elements that characterize trust and suspicion
in those diverse applications.
Another problem in defining trust and
suspicion concerns, to a certain extent, how
trust and suspicion are conceptualized. For
example, is only one dimension involved in
which trust and suspicion represent the extremes of a continuum? And is distrust the
&dquo;opposite&dquo; of trust, or are distrust and suspicion in fact the same?
It is tempting to regard trust and suspicion
as polar opposites; but in terms of function,
this is not so easily the case. Ordinarily trust
is regarded as having positive, desirable consequences, while suspicion is depicted as having disruptive, dysfunctional effects. However, extreme trust-what Deutsch calls
&dquo;pathological trust,&dquo; and characterized by
such terms as &dquo;gullible&dquo; and &dquo;credulous&dquo;
(Deutsch, 1958, p. 278)-may also be dysfunctional just as extreme suspicion-a sort of
paranoid state-may be dysfunctional. On
the other hand, Deutsch does not acknowledge the possibility that a slight amount of
suspicion (however that is determined)&horbar;a
kind of alert but not distracting guardedness
-may be facilitative. It is evident that trust
and suspicion are complex concepts which
probably require a considerable amount of

qualification.
In the next

section,

a

definition and

con-

ceptualization of trust and suspicion will be
proposed. For the purpose of comparison,
however, definitions of trust and suspicion
advanced by Deutsch (1962) will first be

presented.’
The essential features of a situation confronting
the individual with a choice to trust or not in the
behavior of another person are,... (a) the individ-

ual is confronted with an ambiguous path, a path
that can lead to an event perceived to be beneficial
(Va+) or to an event perceived to be harmful
(Va-); (b) he perceives that the occurrence of
Va+ or Va- is contingent upon the behavior of
another person; and (c) he perceives the strength
of Va- to be greater than the strength of Va+. If
he chooses to take an ambiguous path with such
properties, I shall say that he makes a trusting
choice; if he chooses not to take the path, he makes

distrustful choice.
The essential features of a situation confronting
the individual with a choice to be suspicious or
not are,
(a) the individual is confronted with
the possibility that a potentially harmful event
(Va-) will occur; (b) he perceives that the occurrence of Va - is contingent upon the behavior of
another person; and (c) he perceives the possibility
of engaging in behavior that will prevent or reduce
the harmful consequences of the other person’s
behavior, should it occur. In effect, then, a suspicious choice is a choice to engage in behavior to
prevent or reduce the harmful consequences of
another person’s behavior. A choice not to take
an ambiguous path may be considered to be a
a

suspicious one [Deutsch, 1962,

pp.

303-304].

These definitions are, in effect, operational
definitions of trust and suspicion and do not
constitute definitions of trust and suspicion
as concepts. That is, Deutsch delineates the
situations in which trust and suspicion are
assumed to occur, and, from the behavior
observed in these situations, he infers that an
individual has made his choice on the basis of
trust or suspicion. Unfortunately, as will be
evident in a later section, the behavior of individuals in the situations delineated by
Deutsch is subject to other interpretations.
A definition and conceptualization of trust
and suspicion. In order to facilitate the definition, those features which distinguish some
situations from others as involving trust and
suspicion will first be identified. In the simplest and perhaps the most common case, a
trust situation involves two parties which are
to a certain extent interdependent with respect
to the outcomes defined by their joint choices,
and one of the parties (P) is confronted with
the choice between trusting or not trusting

<-----Page 3----->359
the other (0). If P’s choice is to manifest trust
toward 0, then 0, in turn, has the choice of
being either trustworthy or untrustworthy.
However, P’s choice not to manifest trust
toward 0 will preclude betrayal, leaving 0
usually with no further option with respect
to the particular situation. It is important
to note that both P and 0 are cognizant of the
risk to which P exposes himself in his decision to trust O. (&dquo;Risk&dquo; here refers to the
possibility that 0 can-but not that he necessarily will-betray P’s trust.) That is, P knows
O can betray him and 0 knows that P has extended his (P’s) trust even in the face of that
risk. Therefore, even where the risk is perceived to be negligible, the situation still involves trust, as long as the possibility of betrayal by 0 exists.
So far, statements about trust and suspicion
have referred to manifest behaviors but not
to the underlying theoretical states. This distinction, rarely made explicit in other formulations, is extremely important for two reasons, both of which relate to the fact that
observed choice behavior in the Prisoner’s
Dilemma game (PD) has been almost the only
means by which trust and suspicion have
been inferred, defined, and measured. First,
the choice behavior in the simultaneous-play
PD game is not solely attributable to the concepts of trust and suspicion, but is subject to
other interpretations that do not necessarily
involve trust and suspicion. Secondly, the
dichotomous choice behavior presently utilized is not sensitive to theoretically-important
variations in the subjective state. While both
of these assertions will be developed more
extensively in the next section, the nature
and the role of the underlying states will now
be specified in greater detail in the process of
defining trust and suspicion.
Subjective trust and suspicion can be defined in terms of P’s certainty or uncertainty
about O’s trustworthiness. Certainty might be
measured, for example, by P’s subjective
probability that, given the opportunity (i.e.,

if P were to manifest trust toward 0), 0 will
be trustworthy or untrustworthy. The relationship between subjective trust (or suspicion) and the manifest act of trust (or suspicion) can be described by a variety of
functions, some of which are presented in
Figures 1-3.
Figure 1 depicts the full manifestation of
trust through some degree of uncertainty. P,
for example, may leave himself fully vulnerable to 0 while still harboring some mild
doubts about O’s integrity or competence.

Many legal

contracts

are

probably signed

under these conditions, and a patient who
voluntarily undergoes surgery manifests total
trust while, in many instances, still experiencing some uncertainty. When some critical
level of uncertainty is reached, however, P
will begin to withhold full manifest trust in
order to protect himself against the possible
untrustworthiness of O. An escape clause may
be written into contracts, or the patient may
demand additional consultations. At another
point, which may or may not coincide with
maximum uncertainty, there will be withdrawal of all manifest trust in 0 by P. In wage
negotiations, for example, labor and management may break off bargaining altogether.

4. It is suggested that, in addition to the factors associated with previous experience (corresponding to (a) of Figure 4), most of the
independent variables can be grouped into
two other broad categories: structural and
situational factors (corresponding to (b) of
Figure 4) and dispositional factors (corresponding to (c) of Figure 4). It is important
to note that in addition to acting directly to
influence P’s perception of O’s motives and/
or competence (corresponding to (d) of Figure
4), previous experience itself can influence
the structural and dispositional factors.
Each of the three classes of independent
variables may act directly to influence P’s perception of O’s motives and/or competence.
Then, depending on how P does perceive O’s
motives and/or competence, P will experience
some corresponding degree of subjective trust
(or suspicion) which may or may not be manifest as trust (or suspicion). Essentially, the
effects of such observable &dquo;inputs&dquo; as incentive and power upon the observable &dquo;output&dquo;
of manifest trust or suspicion are therefore
mediated by two hypothetical states-first,
P’s perception of O’s motives and/or competence and, secondly, P’s certainty or uncertainty about O’s untrustworthiness.

The way in which trust and suspicion are
basically conceptualized is depicted in Figure

Most studies of trust and suspicion are
characterized by the use of a replicated, simultaneously-played, dichotomous choice
PD game as the means by which trust and
suspicion are manipulated or measured. A
typical PD game payoff matrix is as follows

cell):

that if both select their second alternative
(pz, 02), i.e., if both compete, both receive
only the small payoff indicated in the lower
right quadrant of the matrix. On the other
hand, if both select the first alternative (pi,
01), i.e., if both cooperate, both receive the
relatively larger, but nevertheless moderate,
amount indicated in the upper left quadrant.
However, where one competes while the other
cooperates, the one who competes receives the
largest payoff while the one who cooperates
receives the smallest, as is evident in either
the upper right or the lower left quadrants in
the matrix. There may be, then, a temptation
to choose competitively in the hope that the
other will choose cooperatively.
To account for the underlying motivation
to cooperate, Deutsch (1962, p. 309) postulates the notion of trust:

suspicion. (The

The essential psychological feature of the game
is that there is no possibility for &dquo;rational&dquo; individual behavior in it unless the conditions for
mutual trust exist. If each player chooses to obtain either maximum gain or minimum loss for
himself, each will lose. But it makes no sense to
choose the other alternative, which could result
in maximum loss, unless one can trust the other
player. If one cannot trust, it is, of course, safer
to choose so as to suffer minimum rather than
maximum loss, but it is even better not to play
the game. If one cannot avoid playing the game
and if one cannot trust, there may be no reasonable alternative except to choose &dquo;the lesser of
two evils&dquo; and/or attempt to develop the conditions that will permit mutual trust.

In effect, Deutsch is inferring trust and suspicion from the observation of cooperation
and competition, respectively, in the PD
game. However, the validity of such an approach is quite tenuous for a number of
reasons.

Since these reasons have important implications for the sorts of inferences which

<-----Page 6----->362

might be made about trust and suspicion
from observing game behavior, a careful examination of certain methodological questions is highly warranted. This examination
will concern three methodological questions
in particular: (a) meaningfulness of incentives and payoffs, (b) validity of inferences,
and (c) defining and measuring trust and
suspicion.
(a) Meaningfulness of incentives and payoffs: One of the distinguishing aspects of
real-life situations involving trust and suspicion is that there is something at stake, and
in many cases, the stakes are incalculable.
Yet most of the laboratory studies that have
purportedly dealt with trust and suspicion
have employed points or imaginary money as
the payoff units. It is possible, however, that
real and more meaningfully large amounts of
money might have yielded different results.
As Messe and Sawyer (1966, p. 16) reason,
When rewards are smaller, and their motivating
other motivations more easily enter.
Small rewards do not make behavior unlawful, of course; they simply multiply the potential
causes, making it more difficult to verify theories
based upon responses to the rewards themselves

position has been found in
by Gallo (1966), Knox and

Evidence for this
recent studies

Douglas (1968), McClintock and McNeel
(1966), Messe and Sawyer (1966), and Oskamp and Perlman (1965).
Although these studies are not entirely
conclusive, they do leave many of the existing
conclusions about cooperation and trust (e.g.,
Deutsch’s) open to criticism. The principal
concern here is not so much with the strictly
monetary aspects of the larger payoffs, but
with the fact that we are interested in behavior (in this case, the behavior which
trust and suspicion underlie) in which the
stakes, whether materially large or small, are

meaningful.
Essentially, the problem

of

meaningfulness

reduces to

of utilities and, in this
sorts of
utility units (e.g., prestige) might be studied.
It is difficult, however, to scale other possible
units. Nevertheless it might be profitable to
explore other possibilities, even if the manipulations are rather gross and can only be
placed on an ordinal scale.
Results from the isolated attempts to employ shock as an alternative to monetary payoffs (Bixenstine and O’Reilly, 1966, and
Douglas, 1967) have not been very different
from the results of studies using monetary
payoffs. Another approach is suggested by
the fact that, in true-life situations involving
trust and suspicion, meaningfulness is usually
derived from a considerable amount of personal investment and involvement on the
part of the participants. If subjects could,
for example, be made to perceive that they
were actually risking the loss of their own
money (and if such a procedure were ethical),
then the situation would be more apt to take

problem

respect, implies that perhaps other

spective.
This contention is, to a certain extent, supin a recent study in which Tversky
found that subjects were willing to
pay more than the expected value of a negative gamble in order to avoid the risk of loss
associated with that gamble. Thus, while positive payoffs (i.e., positive expected values
from a gamble) were characterized by linear
utility functions, negative payoffs had nonlinear (concave) utility functions. Unfortunately (in relation to the present discussion),
the subjects in Tversky’s study did not actually have to risk their own money, since they
were given an advance for use during the experiment. Even then they were not required to
undertake the risk of real money transactions
until the last two of 82 trials.
(b) Validity of inferences : Validity is one
of the most important considerations of any
experimental undertaking. Here it deals with
the question of whether or not the PD game

ported

be used to study trust and suspicion. If
the PD game is a valid tool for the study of
these concepts, then, ideally, it ought to be
possible to make reasonably unambiguous
inferences about trust and suspicion on the
basis of behavior observed in that game. For
all intents and purposes, Deutsch and others
equate the observation of cooperation with
trust and the observation of competition
with the occurrence of suspicion. But, as will
be evident from the remainder of this section,
a strong case may be mounted against such
can

equation.

There

are two related questions which
possible approaches to this particular
problem of validity. First, in what important

express

respects does the PD game fail

to

represent

real-life trust situations? Secondly, can other
factors (in addition to trust and suspicion)
be inferred from the observation of cooperation and competition in the PD game?
A moment’s reflection upon the temporal
aspects of acts involving trust and suspicion
suggests that the majority of those situations
are characterized by a sequence of events in
which the act of trust or suspicion is made
unilaterally. The party that manifests trust
or wants to demonstrate trust makes his move
first and in effect places his own fate, to the
extent that he trusts, squarely in the hands
of the other. P, in the act of trusting 0, leaves
himself vulnerable to 0, and both are usually
aware of this vulnerability. Where P suspects
0, i.e., where P has a strong expectation of
an undesirable outcome that results from O’s
choice, then P moves first so as to preclude or
at least reduce the possibility of the negative
outcome. The contention here, then, is that
acts involving trust and suspicion are usually
sequential in nature.
If this analysis is accurate and fairly general, then the element of sequentialness must
be represented in an experimental situation
designed to study trust and suspicion. There
is, however, another reason for asserting that
the notion of sequentialness is important,

and this reason relates directly to the game
situations used to study trust and suspicion.
When P makes a competitive choice in a
condition of simultaneous play, it is difficult
to know if his choice arises out of suspicion,
i.e., out of an attempt to guard against the
worst outcome, or if he is in fact trying to
maximize his own payoff in the event that 0
chooses cooperatively. Although the observed
choice is the same, the underlying reasons
are different. In a sequential play situation,
the maximization explanation is ruled out
and it is more likely, but not necessary, that
P’s choice can be attributed to the concept
of suspicion.
With regard to a cooperative choice in this
discussion of sequential versus simultaneous
play, the focus shifts to O’s selection when
O is either certain or uncertain about P’s
choice. In simultaneous play he is uncertain,
while in sequential play he is certain. In sequential play there is no doubt that, when P
is first and chooses cooperatively, 0 may be
characterized as being either trustworthy-if
he also chooses cooperatively knowing that
P is vulnerable-or untrustworthy, if he
chooses competitively and takes advantage of
P’s vulnerability. In contrast, such imputations about O’s behavior in the simultaneous
play situation are more ambiguous.
Studies of trust and suspicion employing
sequentially-played games are not, of course,
entirely novel. Although constituting only a
small proportion of the total, studies by
Deutsch ( 1960a and 1960b), Solomon ( 1960),
and Swinth (1967) used sequential moves.
However, in contrast to the position taken
in this paper, Deutsch ( 1960a) hypothesized
that psychological simultaneity is an important factor in determining trust, and that
even if there is no existing socialized basis
for trust, trust can occur if there is full psychological simultaneity. (Psychological simultaneity, defined as &dquo;the mutual awareness of
what the other is doing as one decides what to
do,&dquo; was differentiated from physical simul-

<-----Page 8----->364

taneity, &dquo;the occurrence of decisions at the
same physical time&dquo; [Deutsch, 1960a, p. 127].)
Apart from the objection that the distinction
between psychological and physical simultaneity is both ambiguous and questionable,
it is perhaps more important to recognize that
simultaneity is not a necessary condition for
trust. In

fact, it

seems more

the

case

that,

where

simultaneity is required in order for
an exchange to occur, suspicion is more
likely to be operating than trust.
Swinth’s study on the establishment of the
trust relationship is especially noteworthy
since he compared simultaneous and sequential play. He found that there was a tendency,
although not quite statistically significant,
for the establishment of trust to be easier
when play was sequential. His measure of
trust, however, was a simultaneous play of a
PD game.
Solomon’s study was also noteworthy in
that he used sequential choice and asked the
subjects to indicate the choice they expected
O to make. Thus Solomon was able to make
the important distinctions between or among
cooperative choice and trusting behavior, on
the one hand, and competitive choice or suspicious behavior and exploitive behavior on
the other hand.
This discussion of simultaneity has anticipated somewhat the question as to whether
other motives might underlie manifest cooperative and competitive choices. According
to McClintock and others, there are at least
three motives that influence a subject’s response in the PD game: (1) maximization of
one’s own gain regardless of the other person’s outcome, which is more or less equivalent to what Deutsch has called an individualistic motivational orientation; (2) maximization of joint gain, i.e., the total gain for
both oneself and the other, which is approximately equivalent to a cooperative orientation ; and (3) maximization of the difference
between one’s own gain and the other person’s outcome, which is roughly equivalent to

a competitive orientation (Becker and McClintock, 1967; McClintock and McNeel,
1966; McClintock and Messick, 1967; and
Minas, Scodel, Marlowe, and Rawson, 1960).

There may, of course, be other motives.
For example, a punishment or &dquo;vindictiveness&dquo; motive may be operating, wherein the
subject wants to minimize the other person’s
payoff at any cost to himself. Or there may
be a motive to outwit the other person. This
would not involve the pattern of solely competitive responses observed for a competitive
orientation, but might consist of a series of
cooperative responses that would set the stage
for periodic or eventual defection. Such a
motive might be salient where, for example,
the esteem of a third party or onlooker, such
as a prestigious experimenter, is valued.
It has been argued in this section that a
problem exists with respect to the validity of
inferences which might be made on the basis
of the present use of the PD game. It is necessary to conclude that, because subjects may
perceive and be motivated by factors other
than those related to trust and suspicion,
caution must be exercised in making inferences about these concepts on the basis of
observed cooperation and competition. This
is not to say that the PD game is necessarily
invalid for the study of trust and suspicion,
but rather that a more refined and qualified
application of that game is necessary.

(c) Defining and measuring

trust

and suspi-

cion : Related to the

question of inferences is
the problem of defining and measuring trust
and suspicion. It was earlier postulated that
in situations that call for

a

decision to trust

(herein termed &dquo;test situations&dquo;),
there is (1) an observed behavior that is usually of a dichotomous nature-P manifests
trust toward 0 or he doesn’t-and (2) a hypothetical concomitant subjective state of
trust or suspicion that may be assumed to be
or

not

of a continuous nature. If this is the case,
then the dependent variable measure afforded
by the dichotomous-choice game is not ade-

<-----Page 9----->365

quate for

a particular test situation. Perhaps
replicated PD game trials provide an experimental analogue only of replicated test situations, or possibly of the steps that precede a
test situation, and do not allow for an estimate or measure of P’s subjective state. The
subjective state (measured, for example, by
P’s subjective probability that 0 will be trustworthy or untrustworthy, given that P has
already made a trusting choice) is important

since it would be of interest to know at which
point or threshold subjective trust becomes
manifest as behavioral trust, i.e., to what extent P must &dquo;feel&dquo; that he trusts 0 before he
will in fact make a trusting decision. Even
more interesting, the threshold will undoubtedly vary with a variety of situational, structural, and/or dispositional factors, e.g., incentives of P’s own trustworthiness.

Summary and Conclusions
Although the importance of trust and suspicion in accounting for many aspects of interpersonal relationships is widely acknowledged,
there is little consensus regarding the meaning and the nature of these concepts. This
lack of theoretical and methodological development has thereby detracted from their
potential value in attempts to explain or describe various aspects of behavior in a more
rigorous manner.
In this paper, both trust and suspicion have
been postulated as having two related
components-(1) the observable choice behavior, and (2) a subjective state which underlies the manifest choice behavior-and
on this basis, a conceptual model has been
proposed. In addition, methodological considerations germane to the game-theoretic
approach of studying trust and suspicion
have been discussed. From this discussion, it
would appear that if the PD game or some
other non-zero-sum game is to be used in
the study of trust and suspicion, it should
involve sequential choices with meaningful
