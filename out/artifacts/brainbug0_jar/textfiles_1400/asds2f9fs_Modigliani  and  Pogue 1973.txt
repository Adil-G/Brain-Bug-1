CONCEPTS AND EVIDENCE

Franco Modigliani and Gerald A. Pogue1

Today, most students of financial management would agree that
the treatment of risk is the main element in financial decision making.
Key current questions involve how risk should be measured, and how the
A

required return associated with a given risk level is determined.

large body of literature has developed in an attempt to answer these
questions.
However, risk did not always have such a prominent place.
Prior to 1952 the risk element was usually either assumed away or
treated qualitatively in the financial literature.

In 1952 an event occurred

which was to revolutionize the theory of financial management.

In a

path-breaking article, an economist by the name of Harry Markowitz [ 17]
suggested a powerful yet simple approach for dealing with risk.

In the

two decades since, the modern theory of portfolio management has
evolved.
Portfolio theory deals with the measurement of risk, and the
relationship between risk and return.

It is concerned with the impli-ca-

tions for security prices of the portfolio decisions made by investors.
If, for example, all investors select stocks to maximize expected
portfolio return for individually acceptable levels of investment risk,
what relationship would result between required returns and risk?

INVESTMENT RETURN

Measuring historical rates of return is a relatively straightforward matter.

The return on our investor's portfolio during some

interval is equal to the capital gains plus any distributions received on
the portfolio.

It is important that distributions, such as dividends, be

included, else the measure of return to the investor is deficient.

return on the investor' s portfolio, designated Rp, is given by

The formula assumes no capital inflows during the measurement period.
Otherwise the calculation would have to be modified to reflect the
increased investment base.

Further, the calculation assumes that any

distributions occur at the end of the period, or that distributions are
held in the form of cash until period end.

If the distributions were

invested prior to the end of the interval, the calculation would have to
be modified to consider gains or losses on the amount reinvested.

-4____
_111_1_·________1_1_11-

<-----Page 5----->Thus, given the beginning and ending portfolio values and distributions received, we can measure the investor 's return using
Equation (1).

For example, if the investor's portfolio had a market

value of $100 at the beginning of June, produced $10 of dividends, and
had an end-of-month value of $95, the return for the month would be
0. 05 or 5%.
To measure the average return over a series of measurement
intervals, two calculations are commonly used: the "arithmetic average"
and the "geometric average" returns.

We will describe each below.

To

illustrate the calculations, consider a portfolio with successive annual
returns of -0. 084, 0.040, and 0. 143.

Designate these returns as R 1 , R 2 ,

and R 3 .
The arithmetic return measures the average portfolio return
realized during successive 1-year periods.

It is simply any unweighted

average of the three annual returns; that is,

(R1 + R 2 + R 3 ) / 3.

The

value for the portfolio is 3.3 percent per year.
The geometric average measures the compounded rate of growth
of the portfolio over the 3-year period.

The average is obtained by taking

a "geometric" average of the three annual returns; that is,
{[(1+ R)(1 + R 2 ) (1+

3 )]

1/-

1.0 .

The resulting growth rate for

the portfolio is 2.9% per annum compounded annually, for a total 3-year
return of 8.9%3.
The geometric average measures the true rate of return while
the arithmetic average is simply an average of successive period returns.
The distinction can perhaps be made clear by an example.

Consider an

asset which is purchased for $100 at the beginning of year 1.

Suppose the

back to $100 by the end of the second year.

The arithmetic average

rate of return is the average of +100% and -50%, or +25%.

But an asset

purchased for $100 and having a value of $100 two years later did not '
earn 25%;

it clearly earned a zero return.

The arithmetic average of

successive one-period returns is obviously not equal to the true rate of
return.

The true rate of return is given by the geometric mean return

PORTFOLIO RISK

Not everyone agrees on how to define risk, let alone

Nevertheless, there are some attributes of risk which are

reasonably well accepted.

maturity of the notes will be identical with the predicted value.
investor has borne no risk.

The

However, if he has a portfolio composed

of common stocks, it will be impossible to exactly predict the value of
the portfolio as of any future date.

The best he can do is to make a

best guess or most likely estimate, qualified by statements about the
range and likelihood of other values.

In this case, the investor has

borne risk.
A measure of risk is the extent to which the future
portfolio values are likely to diverge from the expected or predicted
value.

More specifically, risk for most investors is related to the

chance that future portfolio values will be less than expected.

Thus,

if the investor 's portfolio has a current value of $100, 000, at an
expected value of $110, 000 at the end of the next year, he will be
concerned about the probability of achieving values less than $110, 000.
Before proceeding to the quantification of risk, it is convenient
to shift our attention from the terminal value of the portfolio to the
portfolio rate of return, Rp.

<-----Page 8----->directly related to Rp, this transformation results in no substantive
difference.

However, it is convenient for later analysis.

A particularly useful way to quantify the uncertainty about the
portfolio return is to specify the probability associated with each of the
possible future returns.

Assume, for example, that an investor has

identified five possible outcomes for his portfolio return during the
next year.

Associated with each return is a subjectively determined

probability, or relative chance of occurrence.

The five possible

outcomes are:

1.00

Note that the probabilities sum to 1 so that the actual portfolio return is
confined to take one of the five possible values.

Given this probability

distribution, we can measure the expected return and risk for the portfolio.
The expected return is simply the weighted average of possible
outcomes, where the weights are the relative chances of occurrence.
The expected return on the portfolio is 10%, given by

where the R.'s are the possible returns and the Pj's the associated
probabilities.

(The expected terminal market value of the portfolio is

equal to M 0 (1 + .10), where M 0 is the initial value.)
If risk is defined as the chance of loss or achieving returns less
than expected, it would seem to be logical to measure risk by the
dispersion of the possible returns. below the expected value.

However,

risk measures based on below-the-mean variability are difficult to work
with, and furthermore are unnecessary as long as the distribution of
future return is reasonably symmetric about its expected values.
Figure 1 shows three probability distributions: the first symmetric,
the second skewed to the left, and the third skewed to the right.
symmetrical distribution has no skewness.

The

The dispersion of returns on

one side of the expected return is a mirror image of the dispersion on
the other side of the expected return.
Empirical studies of realized rates of return on diversified portvolios show that skewness is not a significant problem.

If the shapes of

historical distributions are indicative of the shapes of future distributions,
then it makes little difference whether we measure variability of returns
on one or both sides of the expected return.

Measures of the total

variability of return will be twice as large as measures of the portfolio's
variability below the expected return if its probability distribution is

<-----Page 10----->Thus, if total variability is used as a risk surrogate, the

symmetric.

risk rankings for a group of portfolios will be the same as when variability below the expected return is used.

It is for this reason that total

variability of returns has been so widely used as a surrogate for risk.
It now remains to develop a specific measure of total variability
of returns.

The measures which are most commonly used are the

variance and standard deviation of returns.

Measuring risk by standard

deviation and variance is equivalent to defining risk as total variability
of returns about the expected return, or simply, variability of returns.
The variance of return is a weighted sum of the deviations from

The larger the variance or standard deviation, the greater the

As a rule of thumb, it is often

suggested 'that two-thirds of the possible returns on a portfolio will be
within one standard deviation of return either side of the expected value;
ninety-five percent will lie with plus or minus two standard deviations
of the expected return.

portfolio.

This result will be

discussed. further in the next section.
Thus far our discussion of portfolio risk has been confined to a
single-period investment horizon such as the next year..

That is, the

portfolio is held unchanged and evaluated at the end of the year.

An

obvious question relates to the effect of holding the portfolio for several
periods, such as the next 20 years: will the 1-year risks tend to cancel
out over time?

Given the random walk nature of security prices, the

answer to this question is no.

If the risk level (standard deviation) is

maintained during each year, the portfolio risk for longer horizons will

times the

Thus, the investor cannot rely on the

"long run" to reduce his risk of loss.
A final remark before leaving portfolio risk measures.

We have

implicitly assumed that investors are risk averse, i.e., they seek to
minimize risk for a given level of return.

This assumption appears to

be valid for most investors in most situations.

The entire theory of

portfolio selection and capital asset pricing. is based on the belief that
investors on the average are risk averse.

DIVERSIFICATION

When the distribution of historical returns for the 100-stock
portfolio (Figure 2) is compared with the distribution for National Department Stores (Figure 3), a curious relationship is discovered.

While the

standard deviation of returns for the security is doublt that of the portfolio, its average return is less.

Is the market so imperfect that over

a long period of time (25 years) it rewarded substantially higher risk with
lower average return?
No so.

Much of the total risk (standard deviation of return) of

National Department Stores is diversifiable.

That is, when combined

with other securities, a portion of the variation of its returns is smoothed
or cancelled by complementary variation in the other securities.

Since

much of the total risk could be eliminated simply by holding the stock in
a portfolio, there was no economic requirement for the return earned to
be in line with the total risk.

Instead, we should expect realized returns

to be related to that portion of security risk which cannot be eliminated
by portfolio combination (more on risk-return relationships later).

The

same portfolio diversification effect accounts for the low standard deviation
of return for the 100-stock portfolio.

In fact, the portfolio standard

deviation is less than that of the-typical security in the portfolio.

Much of

the total risk of the component securities has been eliminated by diversification.
Diversification results from combining securities which have less
than perfect correlation (dependence) among their returns in order to
reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing portfolio return.

-13-

In general, the

<-----Page 14----->lower the correlation among security returns, the greater the impact of
diversification.

This is true regardless of how risky the securities of

the portfolio when considered in isolation.
Ideally, if we could find sufficient securities with uncorrelated
returns, we could completely eliminate portfolio risk.

However, this

situation is not typical of real securities markets in which securities'
returns are positively correlated to a considerable degree.

Thus, while

portfolio risk can be substantially reduced by diversification, it cannot be
entirely eliminated.

This can be demonstrated very clearly by measuring

the standard deviations of randomly selected portfolios containing various
numbers of securities.
In a study of the impact of portfolio diversification on risk, Wagner
and Lau [24] divided a sample of 200 NYSE stocks into six subgroups
based on the Standard and Poors Stock Quality Ratings as of June 1960.
The highest quality ratings (A+) formed the first group, the second highest
ratings (A) the next group, and so on.

Randomly selected portfolios were

then formed from each of the subgroups, containing from 1 to 20 securities.
The month-by-month portfolio returns for the 10-year period through
May 1970 were then computed for each portfolio (portfolio composition
remaining unchanged).

The exercise was repeated ten times to reduce

the dependence on single samples.

The values for the ten trials were

then averaged.
Table 1 shows the average return and standard deviation for portfolios from the first subgroup (A+ quality stocks).

The average return is

unrelated to the number of issues in the portfolio.

On the other hand, the

standard deviation of return declines as the number of holdings increases.
On the average, approximately 40% of the single security risk is eliminated
-14-

<-----Page 15----->by forming randomly selected portfolios of 20 stocks.

However, it is

also evident that additional diversification yields rapidly diminishing
reduction in risk.

The improvement is slight when the number of

securities held is increased beyond, say, 10.
for all six quality groups.

Figure 4 shows the results

The figure shows the rapid decline in total

portfolio risk as the -portfolios are expanded from 1 to 10
stocks.
Returning to Table 1, we note from the second last column in the table
that the return on a diversified portfolio "follows the market" very closely
The degree of association is measured by the correlation (R) of each
portfolio with an unweighted index of all NYSE stocks.

The 20-security

portfolio has a correlation of 0.89 with the market (perfect positive
correlation results in a correlation of 1.0).

The implication is thithe risk

uncertainty about the performance of the stock market in general.

Figure 5 is given by the correlation coefficient squared, designated R
(possible values range from 0 to 1.0).
The R-squared coefficient has a useful interpretation.

unique to the portfolio and, as we saw in Figure 4, can be eliminated by

Figure 5 shows the rapid gain in diversification as the

portfolio is expanded from one security to two securities and up to ten
securities.

Beyond ten securities the gains tend to be smaller.

Note

that the highest quality A+ issues tend to be less efficient at achieving
diversification for a given number of issues.

Apparently the companies

which comprise this group are more homogeneous than the companies
grouped under the other quality codes.
The results show that some risks can be eliminated via diversification, others cannot.

Thus we are led to the distinction between a port-

folio's unsystematic risk, which can be eliminated by diversification, and
its systematic risk which cannot.

The situation is depicted in Figure 6.

The figure shows total portfolio risk declining with increasing numbers of
holdings.

The total risk of the portfolio is made up to two parts:

systematic or nondiversifiable risk and unsystematic risk. Unsystematic
risk is gradually eliminated with increased numbers of holdings until
portfolio risk is entirely systematic, i.e., market related.

The systematic

risk is due to the fact that the return on nearly every security depends to
some degree on the overall performance of the stock market.

Investors

are thus exposed to "market uncertainty" no matter how many stocks
they hold.

Consequently, the return on diversified portfolios is highly

correlated with the market.

-16-

<-----Page 17----->4.

THE RISK OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES

Let 's summarize the message of the previous section.

Portfolio

risk can be divided into two parts: systematic and unsystematic risk.
Unsystematic risk can be eliminated by portfolio diversification,
systematic risk cannot.

When unsystematic risk has been completely

eliminated, portfolio return is perfectly correlated with the market.
Portfolio risk is then merely a reflection of the uncertainty about the
performance of the market.
The systematic risk of a portfolio is made up from the systematic
risks of its component securities.

The systematic risk of an individual

security is that portion of its total risk (standard deviation of return)
which cannot be eliminated by placing it in a well-diversified portfolio.
We now need a way of quantifying the systematic risk of a security and
evaluating the systematic risk of a portfolio from its component
securities.
The nature of security risk can be better understood by dividing
security return into two parts: one dependent (i.e., perfectly correlated),
and a second independent (i.e., uncorrelated) of market return.

The

first component of return is usually referred to as "systematic", the
second as "unsystematic" return.
Security Return

Thus,
Systematic Return
+ Unsystematic Return
(4)

-17-

<-----Page 18----->Since the systematic return is perfectly correlated with the
market return, it can be expressed as a factor, designated beta (JI),
times the market return, R m

.

The "beta" factor is a "market sensi-

tivity index", indicating how sensitive the security return is to changes
in the market level.

The unsystematic return, which is independent of

market returns, is usually represented by a factor epsilon (E).

Thus,

the return on a security, R, may be expressed as
R

=

ORm + E

(5)

For example, if a security had a

factor of 2.0 (e.g., an airline

stock), then a 10% market return would generate a systematic return for
the stock of 20%.

The security return for the period would be the 20%

plus the unsystematic component.

The unsystematic return depends on

factors unique to the company, such as labor difficulties, higher-thanexpected sales, etc.
The security returns model given by Equation (5) is usually written
in a way such that the average value of the residual term,

where the average E over time is equal to zero.
The model for security returns given by Equation (6) is usually
referred to as the "market model".

Graphically, the model can be

depicted as a line fitted to a plot of security returns against rates of

-18-

<-----Page 19----->return on the market index.

This is shown in Figure 7 for a hypothetical

security.
The beta factor can be thought of as the slope of the line.

It gives

the expected increase in security return for a 1% increase in market
return.

In Figure 7, the security has a beta of 1.0.

Thus, a 10% market

return will result, on the average, in a 10% gain in security price.

The

market weighted average beta for all stocks is 1.0 by definition.
The alpha factor is represented by the intercept of the line on the
vertical security return axis.

It is equal to the average value overtime

of the unsystematic returns on the stock.

For most stocks, the alpha

factor tends to be small and unstable.
Using the definition of security return given by the market model,
the specification of systematic and unsystematic risk is straightforward -10/
they are simply the standard deviations of the two return components.

Thus, the systematic risk of the portfolio is simply a weighted

If the portfolio

is composed of an equal dollar investment in each stock (as was the case
for the 100-security portfolio of Figure 2), the

p is simply an unweighted

average of the component security betas.
The unsystematic risk of the portfolio is also a function of the
unsystematic security risks, but the form is more complete.

With

increasing diversification, this risk can be eliminated
With these results for portfolio risk, it is useful to return to
Figure 4.

The figure shows the decline in portfolio risk with increasing

diversification for each of the six quality groups.

However, the portfolio

standard deviations for each of the six groups are approaching different
limits.

We should expect these limits to differ because the average
of the groups differ.

The standard deviations in all cases are close to the

predicted values.

These results support the contention that portfolio

systematic risk equals the average systematic risks of the component
securities.

can be eliminated by diversification.

Thirdly, portfolio

systematic risk is a weighted average of security systematic risks.
The implications of these results are substantial.

First, we would

expect realized rates of return over substantial periods of time to be
related to the systematic as opposed to total risk of securities.

Since

the unsystematic risk is relatively easily eliminated, we should not expect
the market to pay a "risk premium" for bearing it.
Second, since security systematic risk is equal to the security

<-----Page 22----->5. MEASUREMENT OF SECURITY
AND PORTFOLIO BETA VALUES

The basic data for estimating betas are past rates of return earned
over a series of relatively short intervals --

months.

usually days, weeks, or

For example, in Tables 3 and 4 we present calculations based

on month-by-month rates of returns for the periods January 1945 to
June 1970 (security betas) and January 1960 to December 1971 (mutual
fund betas).

The returns are calculated in the manner described in

Section 1 (see Equation (1)).
It is customary to convert the observed rates of returns to
"risk premiums".

Risk premiums are obtained by subtracting the rates

of return that could have been achieved by investing in short-maturity
risk-free assets, such as treasury bills or prime commercial paper.
This removes a source of "noise" from the data.

The noise stems from

the fact that observed returns may be higher in some years simply
because risk-free rates of interest are higher.

Thus, an observed rate

It is

important to remember that these estimated values may differ substantially
from the true values because of statistical measurement difficulties.
However, the extent of possible error can be measured, and we can indicate
a range within which the true value is almost certain to lie.
Figure 8 shows a rate-of-return plot and fitted line for National
Department Stores.

The market is represented by a market weighted

index of all NYSE securities.

The plot is based on monthly data during

the period January 1945 to June 1970.
The estimated beta is 1.26 indicating above-average systematic
risk.

The estimated alpha is -0. 05% per month, indicating that the non-

market-related component of return averaged -0. 60% per year over the
25-year period.

The correlation coefficient is 0. 52; thus, 27% of the

variance of security returns resulted from market movements.

The

remainder was due to factors unique to the company.
Our interpretation of the estimated alpha and beta values must
be conditioned by the degree of possible statistical measurement error.
The measurement error is estimated by "standard error" coefficients
associated with alpha and beta.
For example, the standard error of beta is 0.12.

Thus, the proba-

bility is about 66% that the true beta will lie between 1.26 + 0. 12, and
about 95% between 1.26 ± 0.24 (i.e., plus or minus two times the
standard error).

Thus, we can say with high confidence that National

The standard error for alpha is 0.45, which is large compared
with the estimated value of -0. 05. Thus, we cannot conclude that the
true alpha is different from zero, since zero lies well within the range
of estimated alpha plus or minus one standard error (i.e., -0.05 + 0.45).
The process of line fitting used to estimate the coefficients is called
"Regression Analysis".

The beta value for a portfolio can be estimated in two ways.

method is to computer the beta of all portfolio holdings and weight the
results by portfolio representation.

This method has the disadvantage of

requiring beta calculations for each individual portfolio asset.

The second

In this way we can obtain estimates of

portfolio betas without explicit consideration of the portfolio securities.
We have used this approach to compute portfolio and mutual fund beta
values.

This result is due to the low correlation between bond

Up to this point we have shown that it is a relatively easy matter
to estimate beta values for stocks, portfolios, and mutual funds.

Now,

if the beta values are to be useful for investment decision making, they
must be predictable.

That is, beta values based on historical data

should provide considerable information about future beta values if past
measures are to be useful.

The question can be asked at three levels.

How predictable are the betas estimated for stocks, portfolios of stocks,
and mutual funds?

Fortunately, we have empirical evidence at each

level.
Robert A. Levy [ 13] has conducted tests of the short-run predictability (also referred to as stationarity) of beta coefficients for securities
and unmanaged portfolios of securities.

Levy's results are based on

weekly returns for 500 NYSE stocks for the period December 30, 1960
through December 18, 1970 (520 weeks).

Betas were developed for each

security for ten non-overlapping 52-week periods.

To measure stationarity,

Levy correlated the 500 security betas from each 52-week period (the historical

To compare the stationarity of security and portfolio betas, Levy

The question of the stability of mutual fund beta values is more
complicated.

Even if, as seen above, the betas of large unmanaged port-

folios are very predictable, there is no a priori need for mutual fund
betas to be comparatively stable.

Indeed, mutual fund portfolios are

managed, and as such, the betas may change substantially over time
by design.

For example, a portfolio manager would tend to reduce the

it prior to an expected market upswing.

However, the range of possible

values for beta will tend to be restricted, at least in the longer run, by
the fund's investment objective.

Thus, while we do not expect the same

standard of predictability as for large unmanaged portfolios, it is of
interest to examine the extent to which fund betas are predictable.
Pogue and Conway [ 20] have conducted preliminary tests for a
sample of 90 mutual funds.

The beta values for the period January 1969

through May 1970 were correlated with values from the subsequent period
from June 1970 through October 1971.

To test the sensitivity of the

results to changes in the return measurement interval, the betas for each
sub-period were measured for daily, weekly, and monthly returns.

The

betas were thus based on very different numbers of observations, namely
357, 74, and 17, respectively.

The resulting correlation coefficients

were 0.915, 0.895, and 0.703 for daily, weekly, and monthly betas,
respectively.

Correspondingly, the average percentages of variation in

second-period betas explained by first-period values are 84, 81, and 49,
respectively.

The results support the contention that historical betas

contain useful information about future values.

However, the degree of

predictability depends on the extent to which measurement errors have
been eliminated from beta estimates.

In the Pogue-Conway study, the

shift from monthly to daily returns reduced the average standard error
of the estimated beta values from 0. 11 to 0. 03, a 75% reduction.

The

more accurate daily estimates resulted in a much higher degree of beta
predictability, the correlation between sub-period betas increasing from
0.703
to
0.915.6
0.703 to 0.915.

<-----Page 29----->Figure 10 shows a plot of the Pogue-Conway first-period versus
second-period betas based on daily returns.

The figure illustrates the

high degree of correlation between first- and second-period betas.
In summary, we can conclude that estimated security betas are
not highly predictable.

Levy's tests indicated that an average on 24% of

the variation in second-period betas is explained by historical values.
The betas of his portfolios, however, were much more predictable,
degree of predictability increasing with portfolio diversification.

the

The

results of the Pogue and Conway study (among others, see footnote 16)
show that fund betas are not as stable as those for unmanaged portfolios.
On the average, two-thirds to three-quarters of the variation in fund
betas can be explained by historical values.
Further, it should be remembered that a significant portion of
the measured changes in estimated beta values may not be due to changes
in the true values, but rather the result of measurement errors.

This

observation is particularly applicable to individual security betas where
the standard errors tend to be large.

<-----Page 30----->6. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
EXPECTED RETURN AND RISK

We have now developed two measures of risk and described how
they can be measured from historical data.

One is a measure of total

risk (standard deviation), the other a relative index of systematic or
nondiversifiable risk (beta).

We have stated our belief that the beta

measure is more relevant for the pricing of securities.

Returns

expected by investors should logically be related to systematic as
opposed to total risk.

Securities with higher systematic risk should have

higher expected returns.
The question of interest now is the form of the relationship
between risk and return.

In this section we describe a relationship

called the "Capital Asset Pricing Model" (CAPM), which is based on
elementary logic and simple economic principles.

The basic postulate

underlying the model is that assets with the same risk should have the
same expected rate of return.

That is, the prices of assets in the

capital markets should adjust until equivalent risk assets have identical
expected returns.

At this point, we say that the market is in an

"equilibrium" condition.
To see the implications of this postulate, consider an investor
18/
who holds a portfolio
with the same risk as the market portfolio (beta
equal to 1.0).

What return should he expect?

Logically, he should

expect the same return as that of the market portfolio.

Thus,

If he

borrows at the risk-free rate and invests the proceeds in the risky portfolio, his portfolio beta will be greater than 1.0.
The expected return of the composite portfolio is also a weighted
average of the expected returns on the two-component portfolios; that is,

(14)

It is

It says that the expected return

on a portfolio should exceed the riskless rate of return by an amount which
is proportional to the portfolio beta.

That is, the relationship between

return and risk should be linear.
The model is often stated in risk-premium form,
E(rp)

=

p

E(r m )

(15)

where E(rp) and E(rm) are the expected portfolio and market risk
premiums, formed by subtracting the risk-free rate from the rates of
return.

In this form the model states that the expected risk premium for

the investor I's portfolio is equal to its beta value times the expected
market risk premium.
We can illustrate the model by assuming that the short-term (riskfree) interest rate is 6% and the expected return on the market with a
relative risk (beta) of 1.0 is 10%.

The expected risk premium for holding

the market portfolio is just the difference between the 10% and the shortterm interest rate of 6%,

or 4%.

Investors who hold the market portfolio

expect to earn 10%, which is 4% greater than they could earn on a

The predictions of the model are inherently sensible.

For safe

investments (f = 0), the model predicts that investors would expect to
earn the risk-free rate of interest.

For a risky investment (

> 0)

investors would expect a rate of return proportional to the market sensitivity ()

of the stock.

Thus, stocks with lower-than-average market

sensitivities (such as most utilities) would offer expected returns less
than the expected market return.

Stocks with above-average values of

beta (such as most airline securities) would offer expected returns in
excess of the market.
In our development of the CAPM we have implicitly made a number
of assumptions which are required if the model is to be established on a
rigorous basis.

These assumptions involve investor behavior and condi-

tions in the capital markets.

The following is a set of assumptions

which are sufficient to allow a simple derivation of the model.
(a)

The market is composed of risk-averse investors who
measure risk in terms of standard deviation of portfolio

-33-

<-----Page 34----->return.

This assumption provides a basis for the use of

beta-type risk measures.
(b)

All investors have a common ti

e horizon for investment

decision making (e.g., 1 month, 1 year, etc.).

This

assumption allows us to measure investor expectations
over some common interval, thus making comparisons
meaningful.
(c)

All investors are assumed to have the same expectations
about future security returns and risks.

Without this

assumption, investors would disagree on expected return
and risks, resulting in a more complex situation.
(d)

Capital markets are perfect in the sense that all assets are
completely divisible, there are no transactions costs or
differential taxes, and borrowing and lending rates are
equal to each other and the same for all investors.

Without

these conditions, frictional barriers would exist to the
equilibrium conditions on which the model is based.
While these assumptions are sufficient to derive the model, it is not
clear that all are necessary in their current form.

It may well be that

several of the assumptions can be substantially relaxed without major change
in the form of the model.

A good deal of research is currently being

conducted toward this end.
While the CAPM is indeed simple and elegant, these qualities do not
in themselves make it useful in explaining observed risk-return patterns.
We now proceed to the empirical literature on attempts to verify the model.

The term Ej reflects the firm's unsystematic risk -- the risk due

to factors unique to the company.

Unsystematic risk is eliminated when

the stock is included in a well-diversified portfolio.
Thus, if the hypothesis is correct, and we observe returns for
many stocks and many periods of time, then Ej ought to be zero on the
average, and the observed risk premiums on various stocks ought to be
proportional to the stocks' betas.

Empirical Tests of the Capital Asset Pricing Model
If the capital asset pricing model is right, the empirical tests
whould show the following:
1.

On the average, and over long periods of time, the
securities with high systematic risk should have high
rates of return.

2.

On the average, there should be a linear relationship
between systematic risk and return.

3.

Unsystematic risk, as measured by SEj, should play
no significant role in explaining differences in
security returns.

These predictions have been tested in several recent statistical studies.
We will review some of the more important of these.

Regression analyses were

performed for the 1946-55 and 1956-65 periods, using both monthly and
annual security returns.

The relationship of mean security returns and

beta values is shown in Table 6.

The last two columns of the table give

the theoretical values for the coefficients, as predicted by the capital
asset pricing model.
The results sow a significant positive relationship between
realized return and risk during each of the 10-year periods.

For example,

in 1956-65 there was a 6.7 percent per year increase in average return
for a one-unit increase in beta.

Although the relationships shown in Table 6

are all positive, they are weaker than predicted by the capital asset pricing
model.

with a 7.1 percent increase in mean return.
The results for the second test do not agree with the capital asset
pricing model' s predictions.

That is, high unsystematic risk is apparently

associated with higher realized returns.

However, Miller and Scholes

show that this correlation may be largely spurious (i.e., it may be due to
statistical sampling problems).

For example, a substantial positive corre-

lation exists between beta and (SEj).

Thus, even though unsystematic risk

may be unimportant to the pricing of securities, it will appear to be
significant in tests from which beta has been omitted.

Tests based directly on securities,

<-----Page 40----->however, are not the most efficient method of obtaining estimates of the
magnitude of the risk-return tradeoff.

Tests based on securities are

inefficient for two reasons.
The first problem is well known to economists.

It is called

"errors in variables bias" and results from the fact that beta, the
independent variable in the test, is typically measured with some error.
These errors are random in their effect -- that is,

are overestimated and some are underestimated.

some stocks' betas

Nevertheless, when

these estimated beta values are used in the test, the measurement errors
tend to attenuate the relationship between mean return and risk.
By carefully grouping the securities into portfolios, much of this
measurement error problem can be eliminated.

The errors in individual

stocks ' betas cancel out so that the portfolio beta can be measured with
much greater precision.

This in turn means that tests based on portfolio

returns will be more efficient than tests based on security returns.
The second problem relates to the obscuring effect of residual
variation. Realized security returns have a large random component,
which typically accounts for about 70 percent of the variation of return.
(This is the diversifiable or unsystematic risk of the stock.)

By grouping

securities into portfolios, we can eliminate much of this "noise", and
thereby get a much clearer view of the relationship between return and
systematic risk.
It should be noted that grouping does not distort the underlying
risk-return relationship.

The relationship that exists for individual

securities is exactly the same for portfolios of securities.

F. Black, M. Jensen, and M. Scholes [ 1], and a fourth by E. Fama and
J. MacBeth [6].
Blume and Friend's Study
Professors Blume and Friend have conducted two inter-related
risk-return studies.

The first examines the relationship between long-run

rates of return and various risk measures.

The second is a direct test of

the capital asset pricing model.
In the first study [8], the authors constructed portfolios of NYSE
common stocks at the beginning of three different holding periods.
periods began at the ends of 1929, 1948, and 1956.

The

All stocks for which

monthly rate-of-return data could be obtained for at least 4 years
preceding the test period were divided into 10 equal portfolios.

The

securities were assigned on the basis of their betas during the preceding
4 years -- the 10 percent of securities with the lowest betas to the first
portfolio, the group with the next lowest betas to the second portfolio,
and so on.
After the start of the test periods, the securities were reassigned
annually.

That is, each stock's estimated beta was recomputed at the end

of each successive year, the stocks were ranked again on the basis of
their betas, and new portfolios were formed.

This procedure kept the

portfolio betas reasonably stable over time.
The performance of these portfolios is summarized in Table 8.
The table gives the arithmetic mean monthly returns and average beta
values for each of the 10 portfolios and for each test period.

iCIII_-_-

<-----Page 42----->For the 1929-69 period, the results indicate a strong positive
association between return and beta.

For the 1948-69 period, while

higher beta portfolios had higher returns than portfolios with lower betas,
there was little difference in return among portfolios with betas greater
than 1.0.

The 1956-69 period results do not show a clear relationship

between beta and return.
On the basis of these and other tests, the authors conclude that
NYSE stocks with above-average risk have higher returns than those with
below-average risk, but that there is little payoff for assuming additional
risk within the group of stocks with above-average betas.
In their second study [3], Blume and Friend used monthly portfolio
returns during the 1955-68 period to test the capital asset pricing model.
Their tests involved fitting the coefficients of Equation (17a) for three
sequential periods: 1955-59, 1960-64, and 1965-68.

The authors also

added a factor to the regression equation to test for the linearity of the
22/

risk return relationship.
Blume and Friend conclude that "the comparisons as a whole
suggest that a linear model is a tenable approximation of the empirical
relationship between return and risk for NYSE stocks over the three
231
periods covered.
The values obtained for

/0

1 are not in line with the capital

asset pricing models predictions, however.

In the first two periods,

In the third period, the

These

results imply that yl, the slope of the fitted line, is less than predicted
in the first two periods and greater in the third.

<-----Page 43----->Black, Jensen, and Scholes
This study [1] is a careful attempt to reduce measurement errors
that would bias the regression results.

For each year from 1931 to 1965,

the authors grouped all NYSE stocks into 10 portfolios.

The number of

securities in each portfolio increased over the 35-year period from a low
of 58 securities per portfolio in 1931 to a high of 110 in 1965.
Month-by-month returns for the portfolios were computed from
January 1931 to December 1965. Average portfolio returns and portfolio
betas were computed for the 35-year period and for a variety of subperiods.
The results for the complete period are shown in Table 9.

The

average monthly portfolio returns and beta values for the 10 portfolios
are plotted in Figure 12.
The results indicate that over the complete 35-year period,
average return increased by approximately 1.08 percent per month (13
percent per year) for a one-unit increase in beta.

This is about three-

quarters of the amount predicted by the capital asset pricing model.

As

Figure 12 shows, there appears to be little reason to question the
linearity of the relationship over the 35-year period.
Black, Jensen, and Scholes also estimated the risk-return tradeoff
2 5j

for a number of subperiods.

The slopes of the regression lines tend in

most periods to understate the theoretical values, but are generally of the
correct sign.

Also, the subperiod relationships appear to be linear.

This paper provides substantial support for the hypothesis that
realized returns are a linear function of systematic risk values.

Also, it

shows that the relationship is significantly positive over long periods of
time.

Fama and MacBeth [ 6] have extended the Black-Jensen-Scholes
tests to include two additional factors.

The first is an average of the

designated

2

The

second is a similar average of the residual standard deviations (SEX) for
A

all stocks in portfolio p, designated SEp·. The first term tests for
nonlinearities in the risk-return relationship, the second for the impact
of residual variation.

where, according to the CAPM, we should expect '

The results of the Fama-MacBeth tests show that while estimated
values of

2 and Y3 are not equal to zero for each

interval

examined, their average values tend to be insignificantly different from
zero.

Fama and MacBeth also confirm the Black-Jensen-Scholes result

that the realized values of y0 are not equal to Rf, as predicted by the
capital asset pricing model.

Summary of Test Results
We will briefly summarize the major results of the empirical
tests.

-44-

<-----Page 45----->1.

The evidence shows a significant positive relstionship
between realized returns and systematic risk.

However,

the relationship is not always as strong as predicted by
the capital asset pricing model.
2.

The relationship between risk and return appears to be
linear.

The studies give no evidence of significant

curvature in the risk-return relationship.
3.

Tests which attempt to discriminate between the effects
of systematic and unsystematic risk do not yield
definitive results.

Both kinds of risk appear to be

positively related to security returns.

However, we

believe that the relationship between return and unsystematic
risk is at least partly spurious -- that is,

partly reflecting

statistical problems rather than the true nature of capital
markets.
Obviously, we cannot claim that the capital asset pricing model is
absolutely right.

On the other hand, the empirical tests do support the

view that beta is a useful risk measure and that investors in high beta
stocks expect correspondingly high rates of return.

MEASUREMENT OF INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

The basic concept underlying investment performance measurement follows directly from the risk-return theory.

The return on managed

portfolios, such as mutual funds, can be judged relative to the returns on
unmanaged portfolios at the same degree of investment risk.

If the

return exceeds the standard, the portfolio manager has performed in a
superior way, and vice versa.
Given this, it remains to selectaa set of "benchmark" portfolios
against which managed portfolio performance can be evaluated.

The

Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a convenient and familiar
set of portfolios; however, as discussed below, these are not the only
portfolios which could be used.

The CAPM benchmark portfolios are

simply combinations of the riskless rate and market index.

The return

standard for a managed portfolio with average beta equal to Up is equal
to the risk-free rate plus 3p times the average realized risk premium
on the market.

The performance measure, ap,

is equal to the difference

in the average returns between the portfolio and the standard; that is,
p

RF

p

+

p(RM - RF)

(20)

where Rp, RM, and RF are the average returns for the portfolio,
market index, and riskless bond during the test period.
Estimated values of alphs ()

P

and beta (

A

P

) are determined

as discussed in Section 5 by regressing the portfolio risk premiums on
the market risk premiums.

Positive values of ap are indications of

superior performance, negative values of inferior performance.

into consideration possible statistical measurement errors.

ake

As discussed

in Section 5, the standard error of alpha (SELL) is a measure of the extent
of the possible measurement error.

The larger the standard error, the

less certain we can be that the measured alpha is a close approximation
26/
to the true value.
A measure of the degree of statistical significance of the estimated
alpha value is given by the ratio of the estimated alpha to its standard
error.

The ratio, designated as t , is given by
tc

The t

oap
=

p

(21)

gives a measure of the extent to which the true value of alphs can

be considered to be different from zero.

It measures the number of

multiples of standard error that Op is away from zero.
value of t

If the absolute

is large, then we have more confidence that the true value

of alpha is different from zero.

Absolute values of t

in excess of 2. 0

indicate a probability of less than about 2. 5% that the true value of alpha
could equal zero.
These methods of performance measurement were originally
devised by Michael Jensen [ 10] [11] and have been widely used in many
studies of investment performance, including that of the recent SEC
Institutional Investor Study [ 20].
However, the tests of the capital asset pricing model summarized
in Section 7 indicate that the average returns over time on securities and
portfolios deviate systematically from the predictions of the rno del
Though the observed average risk-return relationships seem to be linear,
the tradeoff of risk for return is, in general, less than would be predicted

In short, the evidence suggests that the CAPM does not

provide the best benchmarks for the average return-risk tradeoffs
available in the market from naively selected portfolios.
These results do not prohibit our attempts to measure performance.
They indicate that benchmark portfolios other than those prescribed by
the CAPM would be more appropriate;

but given such alternative naively

selected portfolios, the analysis could proceed in exactly the same manner
as described above.

The work of Black, Jensen, and Scholes [ I ] shows

the average return from naively selected portfolios, when plotted against
risk, tends to lie along a straight line with slope somewhat less than
implied by the CAPM.

These "empirical risk return" lines would seem to

be a natural alternative to the market line implied by the capital asset
pricing model.

Performance would then be measured relative to the

from the portfolio to the market line.

The empirical line measure

(designated a 2 ) is the vertical distance from the portfolio to the empirical
line.
Since the market index ideally is composed of all assets, both
the empirical and market lines would be expected to pass through the
market index coordinates (point O in Figure 13).

<-----Page 49----->The existence of long-run rates of return on the

cT(Io l(et:i portfolih

different from the riskless rate is a clear violation of the predictions of
the CAPM.

As of this time, there is no clear theoretical understanding

as to the nature of this difference.
To summarize, empirically based performance standards would
seem to be the natural alternative to those of the capital asset pricing
model.

This follows mainly because the empirical standards reflect the

actual performance of naively selected portfolios.

However, the design

of appropriate empirical standards requires further research.

In the

interim, the familiar market line benchmarks can provide useful information regarding relative performance, but care must be exercised to avoid
drawing fine distinctions among portfolio results.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Our task is finally completed.

We have presented a brief but

hopefully comprehensive introduction to the foundations and tests of
modern portfolio theory.

Our aim was to provide the reader with a first

view of the subject in hopes that his interest will be whetted for further
27
study.
The major topics dealt with were the specification and measurement of security and portfolio risk, the development of a hypothesis for
the relationship between expected return and risk, and the use of the
resulting model to measure the performance of institutional investors.
We have not provided a set of final answers to questions in these areas
because none currently exist.

The theory and empirical evidence are in

a state of rapid evolution, and our knowledge has increased markedly in
the recent past and will surely continue to do so in the future.

Respectively Professor and Associate Professor of Finance,

prepared by us as Part I of "A Study of Investment Company
Incentive Fee Arrangements". The research was supported by
a grant from the Investment Company Institute, Washington, D.C.

The general expression for the arithmetic mean return for a series
of N periods is given by

R

N

R

Rt

t=1
where Rt is the investment return during period t, as measured
by Equation (1).

The general expression for the geometric or compounded rate of
return over a series of N periods is given by

The total return for the period is given by (1 +

)N - 1.

The relationship between the geometric and arithmetic mean
returns is such that the arithmetic mean is always equal to or
greater than the geometric average. The difference increases
as the dispersion of the returns increases. The following
equation developed by Young and Trent [25] shows the nature
of the difference.

R=

[G +

a 2 (R)]1/2

This relationship shows that R and G are equal only for an
asset with constant returns.

For given R, as

Thus, R

is a good approximation for G only when the variance of the R t
returns is small.

The transformation changes nothing of substance, since

(1 + Rp) M 0

=

M

M 0 Rp

where
MT

Rp
= portfolio return
p
Since MT is a linear function of Rp, any risk measures
developed for the portfolio return will apply equally to the
terminal market value.
6.

Risk measures based on below-average-value variation are
analytically difficult to deal with.

H. Markowitz, in Chapter 9

of [ 18], develops a semivariance statistic which measures

-76-

<-----Page 77----->variability below the mean and compares it with the more
commonly used variance calculation.
7.

See for example M. E. Blume [2].

This result follows easily for continuously compounded rates of
return.

The return for N periods, Rp, is simply the sum of the

N one-period returns; that is,
Rp

Now, if the one-period returns are independently and identically

, then the variance of Rp will equal

The key assumption of

independence of portfolio returns over time is realistic, since
security returns appear to follow a random walk through time.
9.

Two securities with perfectly correlated return patterns will
have a correlation coefficient of 1.0.

Conversely, if the return

patterns are perfectly negative correlated, the correlation
coefficient will equal -1.

Two securities with uncorrelated

(i.e., statistically unrelated) returns will have a correlation
coefficient of zero.

The average correlation coefficient

between securities on the NYSE is approximately 0.7.

The reader may wish to verify that total risk (as measured by
variance) really does equal the sum of systematic and unsystematic

The conversion to risk premiums results in no substantive change
but is consistent with theoretical developments discussed in
Section 6.
13.

The sample was picked to give the broadest possible range of
security beta values.

This was accomplished by ranking al NYSE

securities with complete data from 1945-70 by their estimated
beta values during this period.

We then selected every twenty-

fivth stock from the ordered list.

The data was obtained from the

University of Chicago CRSP (Center for Research in Security
Prices) tape.
14.

The commercial paper results in Table 3 are rates of return,
not risk premiums.

The risk premiums would equal zero by

definition.
15.

Correlation studies of this type tend to produce a conservative
picture of the degree of beta coefficient stationarity.

-79-

This results

<-----Page 80----->from the fact that it is not possible to correlate the true beta values
but only estimates which contain varying degrees of measurement
error.

Measurement error would reduce the correlation

coefficient even though the underlying beta values were unchanged
from period to period.
16.

These results are consistent with those found by N. Mains in a
later and more extensive study [ 16].

Mains correlated adjacent

calendar year betas for a sample of 99 funds for the period 1960
through 1971.

The betas were based on weekly returns.

The

average correlation coefficient for the 11 tests was 0. 788, with
individual values ranging from a low of 0. 614 to a high of 0. 871.
17.

From this point on, "systematic risk" will be referred to simply
as risk.

18.

"Total risk" will be referred to as total risk.

We use the term portfolio in a general sense, including the case
where the investor holds only one security.

Since portfolio return

and (systematic) risk are simply weighted averages of security
values, risk-return relationships which hold for securities must
also be true for portfolios, and vice versa.

The material in Section 7 was also prepared as an appendix to
testimony to be delivered before the Federal Communications
Commission by S. C. Myers and G. A. Pogue.

A

SEj is an estimate of the standard error of the residual term in
Equation (16).

Thus, it is the estimated value for

the unsystematic risk term defined in Equation (8).

of Tables 3 and 4 for typical values for securities and mutual funds.

For example, skewness in the distributions of stock returns can
lead to spurious correlations between mean return and SEj.

There are a number of excellent references for further study of
portfolio theory.

Among these we would recommend books by

Richard A. Brealey [ 4], Jack Clark Francis [ 7] , and William F.
Sharpe [23] . For a more technical survey of the theoretical and
empirical literature, see Jensen [ 12]
