CAPITAL IS KING!
The business world is, hopefully, emerging from a mega-downturn. So, should
the savvy businessman be focused on the top line (revenues) or the bottom
line (profits)? Says John Mullins: neither! Working capital is what companies
like Costco need to survive, and it may also be precisely what your business
needs to prosper.
orking capital is the cash a company
needs to have on hand in the short term to
keep the business running – pay its
employees, suppliers, taxes and so on. The naked
truth about working capital is that it doesn’t matter
how clever your products or how keen your
customers: if you haven’t got cash on hand to keep
your business moving, you’ll be out of business, as
numerous hedge funds and others learned the hard
way in the financial crisis that began in 2007.
In a time of recession especially, what managers
should be thinking about, in a strategic sense, is
cash flow rather than profit. From a business model
point of view, profits are irrelevant. Why? Failure to
earn a profit won’t put you out of business, as long
as you still have cash. But if you run out of cash,
even if you are profitable, you’ll be gone in a
heartbeat. Cash, as they say in entrepreneurial
circles, is king. Consider the case of Costco, a USbased company with over 550 membership-only
warehouses that, in 2008, generated over $71
billion in revenue. Costco has become the preeminent warehouse club retail chain, largely
because management designed its working capital
model to gain competitive advantage.

Roots of cash
While Costco’s working capital model was
revolutionary, it was by no means original. Its model
was based largely on Price Club, its progenitor.

Price Club was created in 1976 by Sol Price in San
Diego, California. His original and prescient leap of
faith was that, by changing the working capital
model in retailing to permit vastly lower prices, he
could charge customers for the privilege of shopping
at his stores. The key to Price’s early success was
his counter-intuitive credo, his refusal to try to
squeeze an extra dollar out of his customers. As
Goldman Sachs retail analyst Stephen Mandel, Jr.,
would later attest, Price Club was the industry’s
best practitioner, turning its inventory about 20
times annually, while possessing negative working
capital of about $3 million per warehouse.
“Negative working capital” is a cash flow model in
which stores can sell and deliver a product before
they ever have to pay for it.
Move inventory quickly and charge a membership
fee? It held the makings of a working capital model
that was little short of spectacular. Costco cofounder and CEO James Sinegal recalls (and lives
by) Sol Price’s principles. “Many retailers look at
an item and say, ‘I’m selling this for 10 bucks.
How can I sell it for 11?’ We look at it and say,
‘How can we get it to nine bucks?’ And then, ‘How
can we get it to eight?’ It’s contrary to the thinking
of a retailer, which is to see how much more profit
you can get out of it. But once you start doing that,
it’s like heroin.” There was another element, too.
“You had to be a member of the club. People paid
us to shop there.”

Cover story

In 1981, Jeffrey Brotman recruited James
Sinegal away from Price Club, where Sinegal had
worked since his teens, rising rapidly through Price
Club’s ranks. In 1983, they launched Costco
Warehouse in Seattle. At the heart of the Costco
strategy was the Price Club working capital model.
First, there was the membership fee. For families
the fee was $50 per year; corporate customers paid
up to $100, collected before the customer ever
started shopping. Second, Costco collected cash
from its customers almost immediately – no credit
cards, thank you, but cash, a check, or your debit
card (which gave Costco instant cash) – maintaining
just three days of accounts receivable. And, as
Costco later proclaimed, “Because of our high sales

negotiators. Second, they bought items to sell in
very high volumes and used that as a leverage to
ask more of their suppliers than others could. For
example, when Costco was selling $100,000 worth
of salmon per week, they were able to use that
volume to convince the salmon supplier to remove
the skin and debone the fish and ultimately charge
even less for the fillets.
Costco also insisted that no item could be marked
up to a gross margin over 14 per cent. Contrast that
with supermarkets and department stores, which
carried 20 to 50 per cent gross margins; discount
stores like Kmart and Target also had greater
average gross margins across their product mix,
ranging from 25 to 30 per cent. To turn inventory

moving, you’ll be out of business.
volume and rapid inventory turnover, we generally
have the opportunity to sell and be paid for
inventory before we are required to pay many of our
merchandise vendors, even though we take
advantage of early payment discounts. As sales
increase and inventory turnover becomes more
rapid, a greater percentage of inventory is financed
through payment terms provided by vendors rather
than by our working capital.”
With its customers providing the cash needed to
grow, Costco soared. By 1996, Costco was
generating $19 billion in sales and $423 million in
pre-tax net income. Let’s look at the working capital
numbers that were making this possible:
G

Current assets (other than cash): 35 days

G

Inventory: 32 days

G

Accounts receivable: 3 days

G

Current liabilities: 41 days

G

Accounts payable: 27 days

G

Membership dues: 14 days (half of membership
dues was taken in income in the current year, and
half stayed on the balance sheet to be taken in
year two)

G

Net of these elements: – 7 days

Costco’s working capital model let it get away with
razor-thin overall profit margins, since earning an
attractive return on investment when your
investment is near zero (thanks to negative working
capital) can be accomplished with very modest
profits. So Sinegal passed on to his customers the
benefit in lower prices. He was underselling his
competition while growing the business on its
customers’ cash. How did Sinegal and his team take
the fat out of margins? First, they were tough

quickly, Costco carried just 4,000 items. A typical
supermarket, Sinegal explained, carried 40,000
items, while a Wal-Mart super centre would stock
some 150,000. With only 4,000 items at rockbottom prices, Costco could pick items that it knew
would move off the floor quickly. Items were
transported straight from the vendor to the sales
floor. No costly warehouses full of expensive
inventory tying up precious cash.
There was one key element, though, on which
Sinegal parted ways with Price Club. Price Club
targeted small businesses and working-class
families – something that rival Sam’s Club
mimicked. For Costco, Sinegal targeted small
businesses and more upscale families, more than a
third of which had household incomes greater than
$75,000. As retail consultant and author Michael
Silverstein explains, these consumers are happy to
pay for upscale items that “make their hearts
pound” and for which they don’t have to pay full
price. Then they trade down to cheaper private
labels for things like paper towels, detergent,
vitamins and other household staples. “It’s the
ultimate concept in trading up and trading down,”
says Silverstein.
Three-quarters of Costco’s product assortment
were basics, from 24-count packages of toilet
tissue, Costco’s top-selling item, to a lifetime supply
of panty shields. The excitement that brought
customers back, however – returning once every 17
days on average, lest they miss out on a bargain –
came from the other quarter. From $800 espresso
machines this week to $29 Italian-made Hathaway
shirts next week to $1,999 digital pianos the week
after, Costco’s stores offered something for everyone
and at bargain prices other merchants simply could

By 2006 Costco had 48 million members and its
stores were generating an average of $120 million
in annual sales. Best of all, its working capital
model had become even more attractive:
G

Current assets: 35 days (no change from 1996)

G

Inventory: 32 days (half Target’s, its discount
store competitor)

G

Accounts receivable: 3 days

G

Current liabilities: 46 days

G

Accounts payable: 32 days (improved by 5 days
against 10 years earlier)

G

Membership dues: 14 days

G

Net of these elements = – 11 days

Costco’s 11 days of free customer cash amounted to
nearly $3.6 million per store, more than enough to
build a new store for each one currently open.
What was the impact of Costco and its warehouse
club brethren on the rest of retailing? Long-suffering
Kmart went into bankruptcy in 2002, and its 2004
merger with Sears held out little hope that either
chain could compete with the likes of Costco, or
with Target and Wal-Mart, which have continued to
thrive. But discount and department store chains

profit margins? It’s exactly how Sinegal wanted it.
“I hate to sound so simple,” he says, “but all we’re
trying to do is sell the best quality merchandise for
a better value than anyone else.” Costco was ranked
number 29 in the Fortune 500 in 2008 and was
the world’s fifth-largest retailer.
Generally, negative working capital is an attractive
route forward if you can find a way to achieve it in
your business. For many savvy businesspeople, in
fact, negative working capital is their Holy Grail.
The negative working capital model offers
significant benefits that are well worth striving for,
and it is not an exotic financial scheme. Thus, the
quest for more efficient working capital models is
far more widespread than the one example of
Costco. In the 1990s, the manufacturing industry
got into the game. Companies such as American
Standard, Whirlpool, General Electric and others
sought to move from the Fortune 500 average of 20
cents in working capital for each dollar of sales to
zero working capital. As managing director Eric
Nutter of Wabco UK, a British automotive subsidiary
of American Standard, saw it, “In business, it isn’t
over till the fat lady sings, and I say she doesn’t
sing till you’re at zero working capital.”
In the 2000s, retailers other than the warehouse
clubs began singing the same tune. Between 2000
and 2004, Tesco, the leading grocery chain in the
United Kingdom, began stretching the payables
terms it obtained from suppliers, freeing up £2.2

not touch. “We always look to see how much of a
gulf we can create between ourselves and the
competition,” says Sinegal.

Costco also insisted that no item could be marked up
to a gross margin over 14 per cent. Contrast that with
supermarkets and department stores, which carried
20 to 50 per cent gross margins.
weren’t the only retailers to feel Costco’s bite.
Costco’s $2 million per week in fresh salmon sales
took a chunk out of supermarkets’ fresh seafood
sales and brought shoppers to Costco for more
groceries than seafood or toilet tissue. Its fastchanging assortment of durable goods helped slam
the brakes on retailers in other categories, too.
In 2006, the average Costco store generated
almost twice the revenue of Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club
stores. Compared with Sam’s Club, Costco had
82 fewer outlets, but generated about $20 billion
more in sales, some $59 billion. Its pre-tax profit
of $1.7 billion, of which nearly $1.2 billion was
membership fees, was a slim three per cent of
sales. With customers paying for the privilege of
shopping, thereby providing the cash needed for
running and growing the business, who needed high

billion (nearly $4 million at that time) in cash that
it could use for growth. The trend toward negative
working capital will continue, though it will be
tested in the aftermath of the global credit crunch
that began in 2007.
For aspiring entrepreneurs and for businesses
already up-and-running in other more capital-intensive
industries, a negative working capital model is
worth searching and working for. It makes it easier
and less costly to get into business in the first place.
And it makes it much easier for your business to
grow. Consumer services businesses – haircutters,
landscapers, tax preparers and the like – seek and
find it by nature, since they get paid in cash and
have little need for inventory. It is no wonder that
these some of these formerly fragmented industries
are increasingly dominated by fast-growing

these businesses are easy to get into and easy to
grow, from a working capital perspective.
Costco offers an additional – and perhaps
unexpected – lesson for aspiring entrepreneurs. If
you aim to start a new venture, why not do it in an
industry whose working capital requirements can be
modest – or even negative? Periodicals publishing
is one example of such an industry; trade show
operators, cable television companies, payroll
processors and other human resources outsourcers
are other examples. You’ll need much less capital
to get started, and less capital to grow, than in
other industries.
There is more on the balance sheet that has to be
funded than working capital, of course. There is the
rest of the investment that it takes to put a company
in business or keep it there (such as retail stores for
Costco or R&D for technology or pharmaceutical
firms). Yet in thinking about all this, one lesson
should prevail: generating the cash you need from
your gross margin or working capital models, rather
than from investors, the more conventional route, is
important – and perhaps critical in a business
downturn, one in which investors may be hoarding
what cash they have. Moreover, who wants to give up
equity to investors if you can find the cash somewhere
else? In closing, I offer four question sets that can
be your launch pad to greater cash flow through
better management of your working capital:
G

Considering your revenue model, when (how many
days ahead of or behind delivering the goods or
services) can you encourage your customers to pay?
Can you get them to pay earlier? Why or why not?

G

How quickly or slowly (measured in days from
when the supplies are delivered or the work is
performed) must you pay key suppliers and
employees? What are the industry norms? Why
might you be able to alter them?

G

How much cash (measured in days) must you tie
up in inventory or other prepaid items – current
assets, in accounting lingo – before they are ready
to be sold? What are the industry norms? Why
might you be able to alter them?

G

Are there any leaps of faith you can identify,
which if borne out in your next experiment, would
enable you to dramatically differ, in working
capital terms, from others in your industry? What
are they, what are your hypotheses, and how will
you test them?

Under economic conditions such as those that
prevail today, top-line revenue is important, of course.
It’s the clearest signal of what your customers think
of your company and what it offers. But more
important than revenue – and more important than
profit, too – is the all-powerful commodity called
cash. Manage your working capital better, and you
won’t run out of it. I
