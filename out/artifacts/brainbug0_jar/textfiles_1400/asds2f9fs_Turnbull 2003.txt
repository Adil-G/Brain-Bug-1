Engaging Shareholders and Stakeholders in Corporate Governance
ABSTRACT
The paper identifies three necessary conditions for investors and other stakeholders to trust
companies and how such conditions might be met. First, directors require systemic processes for
obtaining information independently of management on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities
and threats in both management and the business. Second, directors require sufficient security of
tenure to provide them with the will to act. Third, directors require the capability to act alone, if
required, to protect the interests of the company as a whole. The paper outlines how these
conditions could be met with corporate constitutions that created a division of power among
shareholders with corporate officers being elected in different ways. In addition, shareholders
would constitutionally establish separate stakeholder councils for employees, customers and
suppliers to provide knowledgeable alternative information to management for shareholders and
their directors. In this way shareholders and directors would obtain alternative rich intimate
information on the performance of management and the business independently of management and
so also provide a systemic process for detecting when trust in management might be misplaced.

1. Introduction
This paper analyses why there is little systemic basis for investors to trust large Publicly Traded
Corporations (PTCs) or those with complex operations and puts forward suggestions for
overcoming this problem.
Since the unexpected failures of major corporations with unqualified audited reports in Anglo
corporations around the world in 2001, “the decline in public of trust” (Taylor 2003: 155) of PTCs
has reduced share values by trillions of dollars. Even with such a massive incentive for
shareholders to experiment with innovative ways to rebuild trust, there has been little evidence of
such activity in the middle of 2003. To be seen to be doing something, politicians and regulators
have initiated reforms to improve practices within the existing flawed system. But according to
Monks and Sykes (2002: 19) “When the overall system is flawed, ‘best practice’ comparisons have
no place”.
Recent chairmen of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Dean of Harvard
Business School, Kim Clark, have also recognised that the system is flawed. Clark used the
metaphor of rotten apples in a barrel and suggested that the barrel is also rotten. “What we really
need is a wholesale revamping of the systems of governance and the web of laws and regulations.
The solution is to remake the barrel with new legislation and new regulation.” (Clark, 2003).
This paper provides a contribution on how “to remake the barrel”. It updates the “Flaws and
remedies” presented in the director Diploma education course of the Australian Institute of
Company Directors (Turnbull 1990). The solutions suggested then are as relevant today. However,
since then many of the flaws of the Anglo system of corporate governance have been built into
former socialist and developing countries as well as into privatised enterprises in advanced market
economies (Turnbull 1993). The remedies suggested in this paper introduce A New Way to Govern
(Turnbull 2002a) described as “network governance”.
The reforms required for building trust in PTCs could be introduced without the involvement of the
government, as no new legislation is required. Because of this, regulators could introduce them as a
condition for shares in a company to be publicly traded or a condition for fiduciary investors to
acquire shares in PTCs. While it should be the private sector that leads the way for reform, Monks
and Sykes (2002: 30) state that “An effective external catalyst is needed and that catalyst can only
be the government”.
Five reasons why it is rationale and prudent not to trust PTCs are identified in the following Section
2. Section 3 describes three basic reforms required in corporate constitutions and how these avoid,
reduce, and/or mitigate the reasons for not trusting PTCs. The reforms provide Non Executive
Directors (NEDs) with a systemic basis to more reliably perform their role. Concluding remarks in
Section 4 reviews the reforms and how they might be introduced.
2. Why it is rational not to trust PTCs
2.1 Corruption from absolute power
A compelling reason why it is not rationale to trust PTCs governed by a single (unitary) board is
that directors obtain absolute power to manage their own conflicts of interest. It is widely accepted
that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

2

<-----Page 2----->Building trust in corporations

Evidence of corrupt governance exists since corporate concepts were developed over 400 years ago
(Frentrop 2003). In modern corporations, Monks and Sykes (2002: 9) state that directors have “Six
inappropriate powers giving rise to serious conflicts of interest”. A number of other “inappropriate
powers” creating conflicts and others that entrench directors are described by Turnbull (2000b).
Adam Smith observed in the 18th century that whenever businessmen gather together they are likely
to conspire against the public good. Notwithstanding the evidence history confirming this
observation corporate law is based on the assumption that individuals will behave correctly and
consistently because this is what the law requires! Scientific analysis of human behaviour and
practical experience shows that humans can be unreliable and contrary.
The US constitution recognised the insights of Adam Smith by introducing a division of power to
provide checks and balances. But such division of power in corporate constitutions is not required
by corporate law, regulations, listing rules and so called “best practices” of governance that are all
based on wishful thinking on how humans should behave.
Our host Professor Taylor (2003: 162) states that “The extent of the crisis in corporate governance
is only now becoming clear, and many company executives and board directors are still in denial”.
It would seem that governments, their regulators and many in Academe also share this denial. They
express the view that the existing system is not broke and can be made to work with more
prescriptive rules as found in the Sarbannes-Oxley Act or with the additional prescriptive proposals
put forward by the Court appointed monitor for Worldcom/MCI Inc. (Breeden 2003).
Others argue that the existing unitary governance system can be made to work if people adopted
better values, were better educated and had lessons in ethics. This approach assumes that it is both
desirable and possible to change the nature of all individuals who become company directors and
executives. The creditability of this assumption does not provide a sound basis for fiduciary
shareholders to establish trust in PTCs.
Nor is it desirable to change human nature. Efficient self-governance in social animals is dependent
upon inconsistent and contrary behaviour to sustain their existence in unpredictable complex
environments (Turnbull 2003). Rather than try and change the nature of humans this paper argues
that we need to change the architecture of how individuals relate to each other. In this way the inbuilt checks and balances designed into human nature by evolution can be used to amplify the
checks and balances established by “network governance” as found in nature.
2.2 Information overload
Another reason for not trusting many PTCs is that they can be too complex and/or dynamic for
NEDs, and perhaps even their Chief Executive Officer (CEO), to monitor what is going on, let
alone direct and control the business. This problem and the associated problem described by
economists as “bounded rationality” is discussed in detail in Turnbull (2000b, 2003).
2.3 Inability to discover when trust is misplaced
A third reason for investors not to trust PTCs is that the directors commonly have no systemic
processes for discovering when their trust in management is misplaced. If directors do not have
such processes in place then they are being irresponsible to themselves, shareholders, employees,
suppliers and customers. They undermine one of most important reasons for having NEDs on a
board to monitor the integrity of management.

3

<-----Page 3----->Building trust in corporations

The typical response I obtain from directors when I inquire into what systemic processes that they
have to discover when their trust in management is misplaced is that they rely on the auditor,
financial analysts or the regulator. The problem is that each one of these is relying on the directors
to monitor and control management! Another problem is that the information available to outside
watchdogs is much less and they have only a limited area of concern.
Directors are being irresponsible as fiduciaries if they have no inclusive and reliable systemic
process to discover when their trust in management is misplaced. If directors do not have such a
process, then shareholders may as well just trust management and avoid the need to appoint
directors to monitor management.
Unless companies have published processes for directors to discover when trust in management
might be misplaced, it should not be legal for any trustee of a pension fund to hold shares in such
companies. This is because there would be no basis for fiduciary shareholders to demonstrate to a
court that they have exercised their legal duty of “due care” and diligence in investing the funds of
pensioners.
2.4 No checks against domination
A fourth problem for a large majority of PTCs around the world is that there is a dominant
shareholder that has the power to appoint all the directors and the auditor. Dominant shareholders
and/or dominant management can indulge in unfair related party transactions without proper
disclosure of all the facts and/or without serious objection from the NEDs. This is because the
tenure of NEDs is typically subjected to the grace and favour of the dominant shareholder and/or
management. This makes NEDs their “pawns” as described by Lorsch and MacIver (1989).
In any event, if NEDs did possess the will to raise objections, they could be out voted unless they
represented a majority on the board. If they did represent a majority that had the will to act against
dominant management or a shareholder then NEDs are unlikely to enjoy their status, influence and
privileges of being a director for too long.
If a dissenting NED resigned from the board in protest, this would reduce the constraint on a
dominant shareholder or management to act fairly in the best interests of the company as whole.
NEDs who makes public their reason for resigning run the risk of terminating their career as a
professional director who are typically required to be seen as a “team player”.
2.5 NEDs lack processes to obtain independent information, will and capability to act
A fifth problem is that NEDs typically are not in the position to consistently and reliably obtain
independently of management, the:
(a) information,
(b) will and
(c) capability to act - in the best interests of the company as a whole as required by law.

3. Building a rational and systemic basis for trusting PTCs
3.1 Division of power
A rational and systemic basis for countering the ability of power to corrupt is to introduce a division
of power. There are many ways in which this can be achieved and achieved on a basis to provide
competitive advantages. The competitive advantages available from a division of power is
compellingly illustrated in a number of employee and stakeholder self-governed firms as
documented by Turnbull (1995, 2000a).
A division of power becomes essential to sustain employee owned enterprises. Without it,
management can dismiss employees and employees can dismiss management. This creates
instability and dysfunctional internal politicking that commonly leads to business failure. Two UK
employee-controlled firms illustrate the sustainability of introducing internal checks and balances.
Employees have controlled the John Lewis Partnership and the Scott Bader Commonwealth for
over half a century in highly competitive industries (Turnbull 2000a).
However, it is the self-governing worker cooperatives based around the town of Mondragón in
Northern Spain (Turnbull 1995) and the US constitution that provided the role model for my own
experiences in introducing a division of powers to provide competitive advantages. They
demonstrated how to separate the executive powers of managing a business from the governance
powers of nominating, electing and remunerating directors and managing their conflicts with other
parties.
There is really no reason why management and governance powers should be combined as they
introduce manifold conflicts of interest and opportunities for directors to entrench their positions to
lessen their accountability (Turnbull 2000b). Some writers proposing reform suggest a complete
separation of powers such as Dallas (1997) who suggested a “dual board and board ombudsperson”
while Murray (1999) proposed a “Corporate Governance Board” to take over the governance
functions.
The approach I utilised in Australia to protect my reputation as a professional entrepreneur and
dominant shareholder was not to diminish the responsibilities of directors. Instead, I contractually
established checks and balances when directors, that included myself, became exposed to conflicts
of self-interest. Besides protecting my reputation, the establishment of shareholders’ committee of
review allowed me to reduce the cost of raising millions of dollars of high-risk finance in two startup ventures1.
In the second Australian based and controlled venture, we had consumed our initial funding and
were seeking a second share placement with most of the shareholders being US residents. At a
meeting of shareholders in February 1988 we amended the corporate constitution as described in the
Appendix of Turnbull (1997) to establish a shareholder audit committee described as a “Corporate
Senate”. There were three Senators who were elected by shareholders on the democratic basis of
one vote per shareholder that gave control to US residents. Voting for directors remained on the
plutocratic basis of one per share but “cumulative voting” (Bhagat and Brickley 1984) was adopted
to allow the US shareholders to appoint two out of the five directors.
1

The first venture was a large-scale (10,000 Hectare) cotton irrigation farm that raised finance in 1981 and later became
a PTC. The second venture raised finance in 1988 in an attempt to commercialise the innovative technology of JAC
Tractor Limited described in Turnbull (1997).
5

<-----Page 5----->Building trust in corporations

The Corporate Senate had a much wider remit than an audit committee. A member would chair
meetings of shareholders and determine their conduct. It could act as a nominating committee and
through its power to veto any conflicts of interest of the directors, act as a remuneration committee.
However, as it had no operational powers its members where not exposed to the responsibilities and
personal liabilities of a director. This allowed shareholders with personal high net worth to monitor
their investment directly with access to the same information available to directors.
The need for a Senate resolution might only occur half a dozen times a year when a conflict arose.
It was practical for all business to be carried out by phone with “flying resolutions” sent by fax.
The full Senate never met physically as Senators were based on two continents. They did not incur
any personal liabilities or excessive demands on their time and so obtained no remuneration. In
return they could monitor operations as closely as desired and protect their investment without
exposing themselves to liabilities of being director. It also provided investors a much more
effective way to protect their interests without resorting to proxy fights or legal action.
The directors had the power to call a meeting of shareholders voting on a plutocratic basis to
overturn a Senate veto. But they would now have a well informed “loyal opposition” presenting in
public an opposing case to all shareholders. As a consequence, the directors were inhibited from
even trying to indulge themselves, or their related parties, in excessive benefits.
A dominant shareholder that can appoint all the directors and the auditor is the rule rather than the
exception around the world (Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Schleifer 1999). In these situations,
neither the NEDs nor the auditor can be perceived to be independent of the dominant shareholder.
Much of the rationale for establishing board sub-committees and obtaining trust in companies is
diminished. This situation can also occur with dominant management as well as with a dominant
shareholder.
Corporate Senates elected on a democratic basis provide an antidote to the power of plutocrats to
exploit and corrupt. It is for this reason that Corporate Senates provide a fundamental requirement
for building trust in PTCs. The can provide a “loyal opposition” to the hegemony of management
views to raise issues and provide information that might not otherwise be considered.
Corporate Senates provide an effective, efficient and economical way to provide oversight. They
provide superior checks and balances on the absolute power of directors to manage their own
conflicts of interest than the use of board sub-committees whose efficacy can be questioned. In any
event, board sub-committees exist at the grace and favour of the full board whereas Corporate
Senates are created and obtain their power from the corporate constitution.
Corporate Senates with their veto powers can shut the stable door before the executive horses bolt
away with their stock options, golden handshakes, related party dealings, etc. It is a Corporate
Senate, rather than board sub-committees that should be mandated for all PTCs. A Corporate
Senate can provide NEDs with the will to raise difficult issues concerning conflicts because they
now possess the capability to act alone by referring the matter to the Senate.
Board sub-committees increase the size and cost of boards of smaller companies. Corporate senates
would not, so they could be universally required for all PTCs. Remuneration for Senators would be
appropriate for larger companies. Corporate constitution would need to relate their remuneration to
a scale of fees published by an appropriate professional body or a government body to avoid
senators becoming financially beholden to the directors.

6

<-----Page 6----->Building trust in corporations

Corporate Senates make a contribution in building trust in PTCs because they:
• Avoid “corruption from absolute power” identified in Section 2.1 by eliminating unchecked
power of the directors to manage their own conflicts of interest;
• Reduces “information overload” identified in Section 2.3 by dividing and reducing compliance
information for board sub-committees, etc;
• Avoid “no checks against domination” identified in Section 2.4 by shareholder(s) and/or other
directors;
• Provide NEDs with the “information, will and capability to act” identified in Sections 2.5a,b,c.
3.2 Information independent of management
A principal purpose of a company having NEDs is to monitor management and business operations.
This requires directors to obtain information to form judgements on the Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) of both management and the business.
However, NEDs typically depend upon management to provide them with the information to
monitor management and the business. Besides placing management in a conflict of interest
situation this approach is inconsistent with the legal obligation of directors as fiduciary agents to
carry out their duties with due care, diligence and vigilance.
The problem for directors is compounded because senior management is subject to the same
problem. Lower level management has a conflict of interest in reporting to their superiors as they
are providing information on which they will be assessed.
One reason command and control hierarchies exist is because they provide a way to reduce
information overload to superiors. This introduces considerable opportunity for information to be
lost, filtered, biased, and/or distorted. These problems can occur even in trivial social activities
where income, career and professional status are not a risk such as when playing the game of
“Chinese whispers”. In this game teams of four or more people compete to relay the same message
accurately. But even when people are competing to be accurate, without any condensation of
information, the meaning of the message often changes.
To minimise informational problems corporate constitutions need to make provision for employees,
customers and suppliers to form, independently of management, advisory councils. These
stakeholders are exposed to the detailed operations of management and the business. They obtain
insights, not available to management, such as how their operations compare with competitors and
the needs of the stakeholders.
No business can exist without employees, customers and suppliers so it makes strategic sense for
shareholders to establish processes to bond them to the company with their own forums to further
their interest with the company. Stakeholders can have a larger and longer-term interest to a PTC
than many shareholders. Blair and Stout (1999) use these considerations to develop “A Team
Production Theory of Corporate Law”.
Because of the divergent interest of stakeholders, separate stakeholder councils, self-nominated and
self-elected would be required for the various stakeholder constituencies. Large organisations
might require subordinate stakeholder forums that appoint delegates to a representative council.
Peak stakeholder councils would meet with management, directors and shareholders to provide
advice independently of management on the SWOT of management and the business.

7

<-----Page 7----->Building trust in corporations

There would be minimal costs involved, as no fees would need to be paid. There are a number of
examples of stakeholders spending their own money and time to form informal action groups to
lobby firms. Firms typically try to act against such groups rather than harnessing their knowledge
and commitment to obtain competitive advantages.
Quarterly reports by stakeholder councils to directors could provide alternative viewpoints and
concerns, and on occasions, act as a “loyal opposition”. There is nearly always another side to most
stories and directors need to consider all sides to carry out their duties with due care and diligence.
To not to do so would be acting irresponsibly to themselves and to shareholders. One crucial reason
is that without the establishment of stakeholder councils, NED are not likely to have any creditable
systemic process for discovering when their trust in management might be misplaced.
It is very much in the interest of shareholders to approve changes in their corporate constitutions to
provide processes for their directors and themselves to obtain information on the SWOT of
management and the business independently of management. When directors present their accounts
to shareholders, the shareholders could in turn also obtain alternative reports on the operations of
management and the business from peak stakeholder forums.
Stakeholder Councils also provide formal structures to support Total Quality Management and Just
in Time processes. In addition, they could assist in the development of new products and services.
This is because 80% of product and service innovations typically originate from customers rather
than from the R&D department (Hippel 1986).
Stakeholder Councils also contribute to developing A New Way to Govern (Turnbull 2002a)
described as “network governance”. The efficacy and compelling advantages of network
governance is shown by it emerging in industries that are involved in rapid changes and/or in
knowledge intensive activities as reported by Jones, Hesterly and Borgatti (1997).
Stakeholder Councils make contributions in building trust in PTCs because they:
• Avoid “corruption from absolute power”, referred to in Section 2.1, from management’s
monopoly on operating information;
• Minimise information over-load, referred to in Section 2.2, by providing a rational basis to rely
on exception reporting and cross checking of information from stakeholders;
• Provide a way for directors to discover when their trust in management might be misplaced
referred to in Section 2.3, and also providing a basis for shareholders to discover when their
directors might not fully account for significant concerns;
• Provide intelligence on unfair related party transactions with dominant shareholders and/or
management, as referred to in Section 2.4;
• Provide NEDs with the information to act independently of management, referred to in Section
2.5a.
3.3 Providing directors with the will to act
Directors may not have the will to speak out fearlessly on matters because they feel that their
position on the board is subject to the grace and favour of the Chair, management and/or a dominant
shareholder. To provide a basis to overcome this problem, NEDs need to secure their tenure on the
board independently of dominant parties. Cumulative voting allows minorities to appoint directors
independently of dominant shareholders in proportion to their shareholding (Bhagat and Brickley
1984). Cumulative voting provides a basis for empowering NEDs to speak out with new
information fearlessly and possess “the will act” (Regan 1993).
8

<-----Page 8----->Building trust in corporations

Cumulative voting makes a contribution in building trust in PTCs because it:
• Divides the “absolute power” of a board as referred to in Section 2.1;
• Introduces “checks against domination” of a shareholder, management or other directors as
referred to in Section 2.4;
• Provides NEDs with new “information” and “will” to act as referred to Sections 2.5a,b.
4. Concluding remarks
No system of corporate governance may be perfect but some can be better than others. As one CEO
remarked, he expected 10% of his employees would always do the right thing and 10% will
misbehave. The remaining 80% might be tempted to do the wrong thing if placed under pressure of
if they thought they would not be caught and/or that they could profitable survive being caught. All
that can be hoped for then is to design a system that does not provide temptation for the 80% and
establish processes to avoid, inhibit, mitigate and/or identify when inappropriate behaviour occurs.
This paper argues that the necessary conditions for trusting corporations is that its directors have
processes in place to further the best interest of the company as a whole by providing them with:
• Information independently of management on which to act;
• The will to act independently of management or a dominant shareholder, and
• The capability to act independently of management and/or a dominant shareholder.
The paper showed in Section 2 why the Anglo system of corporate governance fails to provide these
three necessary conditions. It was argued that without these conditions being met, fiduciary
shareholders might not have a basis for a creditable defence for investing in such a PTC.
The three changes required in corporate constitutions to allow NEDs to adequately and consistently
carry out their duties would also introduce changes that avoid, inhibit, mitigate and/or manage the
five flaws identified in Section in 2 in the governance of PTCs with a unitary board.
For responsible fiduciary shareholders to trust PTCs they would need to change corporate
constitutions to introduce:
• A democratically elected shareholders’ committee with at least veto powers over any conflicts
of interest of any director;
• The establishment of various independently elected stakeholder councils to advise NEDs and
shareholders on the SWOT of management and the business;
• Cumulative voting to provide NEDs with the will to act.
These three changes in corporate constitutions would together provide a rationale and systemic
basis for shareholders, stakeholders and the public to trust corporations as summarised in Table 1,
Corporate flaws and remedies.
The recommended remedies only require a change in corporate constitutions so that they could be
introduced without any changes in corporate law as demonstrated in Australia (Turnbull 1997).
They could be unilaterally introduced by shareholders, or by stock exchange listing rules and/or by
regulators.
The remedies are consistent with and illustrate a basic law in the “science of governance” (Turnbull
2002b). The law “absolutely prohibits any direct and simple magnification but it does not prohibit
supplementation” of regulation (Ashby 1968: 268). This means that it is impossible for regulation
9

<-----Page 9----->Building trust in corporations

to be carried out directly by any single government authority. Regulation of complexity is only
possible by the establishment of supplementary regulators to provide requisite variety of
communication channels, decision-makers and controllers (Turnbull 2000b, 2002b, 2003).

Even with requisite variety of control agents the capacity to regulate complexity is limited by the
capacity of communication channels (Ashby 1968: 211). Without stakeholder councils, directors do
not have sufficient capacity in their communication and control channels to either monitor or
control large and/or complex corporations. This means that it is impossible for directors, or any
other regulatory body, to reliability monitor and control large and/or complex businesses without
self-elected stakeholder councils and corporate senates to “supplement” regulation. In other words,
a strategy of co-regulation is required to efficiently control complexity.
Auditors were suppose to be the front line watchdog for prudential regulators but have
demonstratively failed. In any event, auditors cannot provide requisite variety of information.
Corporate Senators provide a way to reinstate the usefulness auditors for directors, shareholders and
regulators. Corporate Senates also complement the role of auditors as a watchdog and could
substantially increase the remit of auditors in their watchdog role as occurs in the public sector.
It is the prudential and other industry regulators that should mandate the reforms described in this
paper. Co-regulation provides the most efficient, effective and reliable basis for them to carry out
their roles. Inquiries into recent corporate failures have shown that in many instances the problems
were known to stakeholder’s years before failure occurred. However, there was no safe formal
communication channel like stakeholder councils to inform directors, let alone an industry
regulator.

10

<-----Page 10----->Building trust in corporations

Likewise, the analysis of this paper provides grounds for law makers and/or regulators prohibiting
fiduciary shareholder investing in firms that have not established compelling processes to at least
manage, if not avoid or mitigate, the reasons why it is not rational to trust PTCs.
Ideally, when venture capitalists and/or an investment bank arranges an Initial Public Offering
(IPO) they should require corporate constitutions to include the three proposals described in this
paper. Before an IPO, venture capitalists have a shareholders agreement to provide them with
special powers to control management. However, these agreements are dissolved with an IPO to
expose venture capitalists to the risks created by the flaws described in this paper.
Venture capitalists and underwriters have both the vested interest and the bargaining power to
unilaterally introduce the changes in corporate constitutions proposed. Fiduciary shareholders
should also demand reform, as should stakeholders. Employees have their jobs at risk, customers
have their product warranties at risk and suppliers have their customers at risk.
The breadth of concerns in the community should make it politically attractive for governments to
introduce the reforms to protect their citizens. It also provides a way for making regulators more
effective and efficient. At the macro level the reforms provide a way to make capitalism more
socially responsive and to enrich democracy.
