GEORGE E. MANNERS, JR.

Group size was investigated as a predictor of problem
solving effectiveness and postdiscussion member consensus. Prediscussion consensus, ability of group's best
member, average ability of the group, and variance of
individual abilities were analyzed. Group size and performance of best individual accounted for 42 percent of
the variance in group performance.
In 1963, Thomas and Fink reported the results of a literature search in
which the often overlooked variable of group size was studied in relation
to various dependent variables of group functioning. Basically, their conclusions were that "groupsize is an importantvariable which should be taken
into account in any theory of group behavior, and future research on group
size should proceed more systematicallythan in the past" (27, p. 371 ).
As was obvious in the research covered by Thomas and Fink, the
problems inherent in the study of group size can be classified as: (a) the
lack of consistent criterion variables; (b) unsystematic variations in group
size; (c) failure either to experimentally control or to statistically analyze
relevant concomitant variables; and (d) ignoring the possibility of nonlinear relationshipspresent in the data. A recent study by Cummings, Huber,
and Arendt (4), indicates that little progress, if any, has been made in
these areas.
NATURE OF THE PROBLEM
Group Versus Individual Performance

Before examining the size variable, it is worthwhile to consider some
of the effects of collective action on problem solutions. The research on
this topic is extensive, but some studies in particular guided the methodGeorge E. Manners, Jr. (Ph.D.-Georgia State University) is Assistant Professor of

ology of this research. Zajonc (31), using an application of statistical
sampling theory, gives an excellent account of the apparent superiority of
group over individual decisions. Steiner (24) has carried the argument
of superiority one step further by noting that for many situations it is more
appropriateto determine whether the group performs more effectively than
would the most competent member of the group working alone. Steiner goes
on to state that the most competent members of randomly selected groups,
on t-heaverage, will fall at the 100 n/ (n + ) th centile in the population
from which they are drawn. Consequently, if groups function at the level of
their most competent members, their scores will be unbiased estimates of
that population percentage. Barnlund (2) adds research to substantiate
some of Steiner's argument by showing that majority decisions, when there
are certain deadlocks, are not significantly different from those made by
the average individual and are inferior to those of the best members of the
group working alone. The results of these few studies would indicate that,
although groups are usually shown to be more effective than individuals
in problem solving tasks, much more than the typical test between means
is necessary to understand the extent of this alleged superiority; and, if
groups are superior, the question of size takes on increased importance.
Group Size and Problem Solving Effectiveness

The effect of group size on group effectiveness has received moderate
research emphasis. However, generalizations are difficult because of the
heterogeneous nature of performance criteria. South (23) appears to have
initiated the dilemma in 1927 by observing varying effects when comparing
three person groups with six person groups on four different problems
classified as abstract or concrete. Watson (29) in 1928 found a correlation
of 0.65 between group size and number of different correct words created in
an anagrams task. Since that time, such criterion measures as number of
suggested solutions (7), the "twenty questions" game (26), unscrambling
sentences (12), the Tartaglia problem (15,16), and the "moon" game (4)
have been used to investigate the effects of group size on group effectiveness
under the heading of problem solving. Criterion measure differences on
group tasks other than simply problem solving naturally exist (9, 13, 17,
19, 20, 27, 32). Nevertheless, significant, although varying, effects of group
size on group performance usually are found.
In addition to the criterion problem, the experimental range in group
size in past research causes difficulties when comparing results. Studies in
which the maximum group size is six or less are frequent (4, 9, 12, 13, 19,
26,27, 32). Gibb (7), however, ranged group size from two to 96, although
not in successive integers (which is hardly necessary). Thomas and Fink
summarized the problem by stating: "The pertinent range in sizes in order
to generalize safely about small groups would seem to be two through at
least 20" (28, p. 376).
One explanation for the use of very small groups in past researchbecomes

clear when one realizes that to range group size from two to n requires
individuals. Thus, at least 209 subjects would be necessary
n(n + 1)/2-1
to satisfy the minimum requirementssuggested by Thomas and Fink. However, when there are as few as three different group sizes, there still is one
degree of freedom available for testing nonlinear group-size relationships,
a fact most researcherschoose to ignore.
Group Size and Member Consensus

Many of the methodological difficulties mentioned above also occur
when the effect of group size on postdiscussion member consensus is studied.
For example, studies involving cohesion (21 ), sense of belongingness ( 18),
and member satisfaction (22, 30) have been quoted as investigations of
group consensus. However, the focal point of the present study is the overt
expression of agreement with group judgments by individual members as a
function of group size. An example of such an investigation is that of Hare
(11), who found that five-person groups arrived at a significantly higher
level of agreement after discussion than did 12-person groups. Conversely,
the Asch-type phenomenon (1) is well documented and generally demonstrates a positive relationship between member agreement after feedback
and group size (5, 6, 8, 14, 25).
OBJECTIVES
Statement of the Problem

The major objective of this study is to deal more systematically with the
group size variable as a predictor of two specific aspects of group functioning-problem solving effectiveness and postdiscussion member consensus.
Hypotheses

Hypothesis Ia. The mean performance of groups on a problem solving
task will be significantly better than the mean performance of individuals
working alone who make up the population from which the groups are
drawn.
Hypothesis lb. The performance of groups will be significantly better
than the performance of their most competent members working alone.
Hypothesis Ic. There will be no significant practice effect exhibited on a
problem solving task when the members of the population from which the
groups are drawn have been previously exposed to the problem.
Hypothesis IIa. Group performance on a problem solving task will have
a significant parabolic relationshipwith group size.
Hypothesis lIb. The mean performance of the individual members of a
group working alone will be a significant concomitant variable with group
size when predicting the problem solving ability of the group.
Hypothesis lIc. The performance of the most competent member of a

<-----Page 4----->718

group working alone will be a significant concomitant variable with group
size when predicting the problem solving ability of the group.
Hypothesis lId. The variance in the performance of the individual members of a group working alone will be a significant concomitant variable
with group size when predicting the problem solving ability of the group.
Hypothesis lIla. Postdiscussion member consensus of a problem solving
group will show a significant hyperbolic relationship with group size.
Hypothesis IlIb. Postdiscussion member consensus of a problem solving
group will be positively correlated with prediscussion member consensus.
Hypothesis IlIc. Postdiscussion member consensus will have a significant
positive partial correlation (e.g., group size constant) with the problem
solving performance of the group.
METHOD

Subjects
The subjects used in this study were 386 high school students taking
social studies. The students took part in the research during regular classroom hours. Fourteen different classes, approximately equal in enrollment,
were represented.
Instrument
The problem solving task employed was the familiar "moon" game ( 10),
also used by Cummings, Huber, and Arendt (4). The high school students
had never seen the instrument.
Each student played the game three times, replicating the Cummings
study. On the first play, students ranked the items while working alone. Each
student then was randomly assigned to a group. The size of the groups
varied from two to 18. On the second play the group ranked the items. No
instructions were given with respect to how each group should reach agreement. On the third play each subject again ranked the items while working
alone. Twenty students were assigned randomly to a control group and
ranked the items while working alone on all plays of the game. The investigator was concerned about classroom time and therefore did not keep
track of the length of time needed for the groups to arrive at solutions. This
concern turnedout to be unfounded, and it is unfortunatethat solution times
were not recorded. Table 1 shows the group assignments.
The measure of problem solving effectiveness was calculated by summing the absolute value deviation of the respondents'ranks from the correct
rank for all 15 items in the moon game (as was done in Cummings' study).
In other words, low scores indicate superior overall performance. This
should be kept in mind in interpretingthe results which follow.
Hypothesis Testing Methods

Hypothesis Ia was tested using a simple test between means. The mean
performance of individuals working alone was obtained from the first play

of the game. The mean performance of groups was determined from the
second play. Hypothesis lb was tested in two ways. The first was a test
1 between means with a significance level, following Steiner, of a
total number of subjects excluding the
0.003, where n

between the score of the best member of a group working alone and the
0.05). Hypothesis Ic was tested by
score of his corresponding group (a
comparing the mean performance of the control group on the first and
second plays of the game.
Hypotheses IIa, b, c, and d were tested using regression models. Hypothesis Ila was tested using a quadratic model of group size; IIb c, and d
were tested by adding a linear component to the quadratic model. Hypotheses IIb and IId presented a problem with respect to the "best" measure
of the covariance factor involved. Since two individuals could get the same
score on the game yet have quite different rankings for each item, two
measures were used for both IIb and IId. For IId, the variance of the
individual members working alone was measured by (a) the variance of the
individual scores of the group on the first play of the game and (b) a
concordance coefficient representingthe before-discussion agreement of the
individual rankings. The two measures of course behave inversely. For IIb,
the mean performance of the individual members of a group working alone
was measured by (a) the mean of the individual scores in the group on the
first play of the game and (b) the average concordance of the rankings of
each member and the correct rankings (3).
The criterion variable used in testing Hypotheses IIIa, b, and c was the
coefficient of concordance arrived at on the third play of the game. This
measure is an appropriate expression of overall postdiscussion member
agreement and, importantly, is not a function of the correct rankings; it is
necessary only to agree, as opposed to agreeing with the correct answers
as has been required in other studies (4). Hypothesis IIIc takes care of
the "correctness"question.

The results of the group problem solving session (second play of the
game) definitely support Hypotheses IIa and IIc. Table 3 shows a summary
of the results for the problem solving hypotheses, IIa, b, c, and d. As stated
earlier, a quadratic model was used to test the nonlinear hypothesis, Ila.
Results showed a significant quadratic relationship between group size and
the problem solving performance of the group (p - 0.0003). The partial
regressionweights of the quadraticmodel (a -48.6, b -4.52, c 0.20)
predict the optimal group size to be 11 members in this situation (see Figure
1). The only significant concomitant variable was the score of the best
individual in the group working alone, supporting Hypothesis Ilc (p =
0.005). Knowledge of the mean performance of the individual members of
the group working alone, Ilb, measured either by the mean individual scores
or the mean concordance with the correct rankings, and knowledge of individual variability, Ild, measured by prediscussion concordance or variance in scores, did not significantly improve the variance accounted for in
the quadraticmodel of group size.
The results of the consensus session (third play of the game) support
Hypotheses Illa and IIlb. As has been found by other researchers (4), the
linear correlation between group size and postdiscussion member consensus
-.140). However, it was stated earlier
is negative but not significant (r

that Illa was to be tested using a hyperbolic function which yields a log-log
correlationof -.391, supportingthe hypothesis (p < .05). Figure 2 demonstrates the observed statistical relationshipbetween postdiscussion consensus
and group size (y -0.889 X 59). This result can be interpreted to mean
that as a small group adds new members, postdiscussion consensus drops
off sharply at first but is soon virtually unaffected or affected only slightly
by the addition of new members. Also, it is noted that the optimal problem
solving group size is a low consensus size. It appears that the larger groups
do not have enough opportunity for changing opinions of members.
Postdiscussion member consensus also shows a significant linear relationship to prediscussion consensus (r - .396, p < .05), supporting Hypothesis
IlIb. Postdiscussion consensus, however, is not related to the problem solving
performance of the group; the partial correlation with group size constant
is -.108. Hypothesis IIlc therefore is rejected. However, postdiscussion
consensus with the correct rankings is related to the group's problem solving
performance (r - -.640; again, low performance scores indicate superior
rankings). This, of course, was not the hypothesis. Agreement can be independent of effectiveness and still be agreement.
CONCLUSIONS

The purpose of this study was to take another look at the variable of
group size as a predictorof problem solving effectiveness and post discussion

<-----Page 9----->1975

member consensus. Results show that group size had a significant nonlinear effect on both dependent variables.
As for the implications of the present study, reference can be made to the
Cummings, Huber, and Arendt conclusions:
Using as a focus the goal of the administratorin forming the group, it appears
that if the quality of the group's solution is of considerable importance, it is
useful to include a larger number of members, e.g., seven to twelve, so that
many inputs are available to the group in making its decisions .... If the degree
of consensus is of primary importance, it is useful to choose a smaller group,
e.g., three to five so that each member can have his concern considered and
discussed(4, p. 473).

Although the data presented by Cummings, Huber, and Arendt do not
justify those conclusions, the present study does support them.
Admittedly, this study is another in a long line of myopic group studies in
that only macro variables of group performance were investigated. Factors
such as the nature of interaction, group organization, member personality
makeup, etc., were ignored. Nevertheless, knowledge of only two variables,
group size and the performance of the best member of the group working
alone, accounted for 42 percent of the total variance in group problem
solving performance.
