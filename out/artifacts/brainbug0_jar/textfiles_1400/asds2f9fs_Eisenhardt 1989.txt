Agency Theory: An Assessment
and Review
KATHLEEN M. EISENHARDT
Stanford University
Agency theory is an important, yet controversial, theory. This paper
reviews agency theory, its contributions to organization theory, and
the extant empirical work and develops testable propositions. The
conclusions are that agency theory (a) offers unique insight into information systems, outcome uncertainty, incentives, and risk and (b)
is an empirically valid perspective, particularly when coupled with
complementary perspectives. The principal recommendation is to incorporate an agency perspective in studies of the many problems
having a cooperative structure.
purposes of this paper are to describe agency
theory and to indicate ways in which organizational researchers can use its insights. The paper is organized around four questions that are
germane to organizational research. The first
asks the deceptively simple question. What is
agency theory? Often, the technical style, mathematics, and tautological reasoning of thÂ©
agency literature can obscure the theory. Moreover, the agency literature is split into two
camps (Jensen, 1983), leading to differences in
interpretation. For example, Barney and Ouchi
(1986) argued that agency theory emphasizes
how capital markets can affect the firm,
whereas other authors made no reference to
capital markets at all (Anderson, 1985; Demski &
Feitham, 1978; Eccles, 1985; Eisenhardt, 1985).
The second question is. What does agency
theory contribute to organizational theory? Proponents such as Ross (1973, p. 134) argued that
"examples of agency are universal." Yet other
scholars such as Perrow (1986) claimed that
agency theory addresses no clear problems,
and Hirsch and Friedman (1986) called it excessively narrow, focusing only on stock price. For
economists, long accustomed to treating the or-

One day Deng Xiaoping decided to take his
grandson to visit Mao. "Call me granduncle,"
Mao offered warmly. "Oh, 1 certainly couldn't
do that. Chairman Mao," the awe-struck child
replied. "Why don't you give him an apple?"
suggested Deng. No sooner had Mao done so
than the boy happily chirped, "Oh thank you.
Granduncle." "You see," said Deng, "what incentives can achieve." ("Capitalism," 1984, p.
62)
Agency theory has been used by scholars in
accounting (e.g., Demski & Feitham, 1978), economics (e.g., Spence & Zeckhauser, 1971), finance (e.g., Fama, 1980), marketing (e.g., Basu,
Lai, Srinivasan, & Staelin, 1985), political science (e.g., Mitnick, 1986), organizational behavior (e.g., Eisenhardt, 1985, 1988; Kosnik, 1987),
and sociology {e.g., Eccles, 1985; White, 1985).
Yet, it is still surrounded by controversy. Its proponents argue that a revolution is at hand and
that "the foundation for a powerful theory of organizations is being put into place" (Jensen,
1983, p. 324). Its detractors call it trivial, dehumanizing, and even "dangerous" (Perrow, 1986,
p. 235).
Which is it: grand theory or great sham? The
57

<-----Page 1----->vision of labor (Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Ross,
1973). Specifically, agency theory is directed at
the ubiquitous agency relationship, in which
one party (the principal) delegates work to another (the agent), who performs that work.
Agency theory attempts to describe this relationship using the metaphor of a contract (Jensen &
Meckling, 1976).
Agency theory is concerned with resolving
two problems that can occur in agency relationships. The first is the agency probl&m that arises
when (a) the desires or goals of the principal and
agent conflict and (b) it is difficult or expensive
for the principal to verify what the agent is actually doing. The problem here is that the principal cannot verify that the agent has behaved
appropriately. The second is the problem of risk
sharing that arises when the principal and
agent have different attitudes toward risk. The
problem here is that the principal and the agent
may prefer different actions because of the different risk preferences.
Because the unit of analysis is the contract
governing the relationship between the principal and the agent, the focus of the theory is on
determining the most efficient contract governing the principal-agent relationship given assumptions obout people (e.g., self-interest,
bounded rationality, risk aversion), organizations (e.g., goal conflict among members), and
information (e.g., information is a commodity
which can be purchased). Specifically, the
question becomes. Is a behavior-oriented contract (e.g., salaries, hierarchical governance)
more efficient than an outcome-oriented contract (e.g., commissions, stock options, transfer
of property rights, market governance)? An overview of agency theory is given in Table 1.
The agency structure is applicable in a variety
of settings, ranging from macrolevel issues such
as regulatory policy to microlevel dyad phenomena such as blame, impression management, lying, and other expressions of selfinterest. Most frequently, agency theory has
been applied to organizational phenomena

ganizatjon as a "black box" in the theory of the
firm, agency theory may be revolutionary. Yet,
for organizational scholars the worth of agency
theory is not so obvious.
The third question is. Is agency theory empirically valid? The power of the empirical research
on agency theory to explain organizational phenomena is important to assess, particularly in
light of the criticism that agency theory is
"hardly subject to empirical test since it rarely
tries to explain actual events" (Perrow, 1986, p.
224). Perrow (1986) also criticized the theory for
being un realistically one-sided because of its
neglect of potential exploitation of workers.
The final question is, What topics and contexts
are fruitful for organizational researchers who
use agency theory? Identifying how useful
agency theory can be to organizational scholars
requires understanding the situations in which
the agency perspective can provide theoretical
leverage.
The principal contributions of the paper are to
present testable propositions, identify contributions of the theory to organizational thinking,
and evaluate the extant empirical literature. The
overall conclusion is that agency theory is a useful addition to organizational theory. The
agency theory ideas on risk, outcome uncertainty, incentives, and information systems are
novel contributions to organizational thinking,
and the empirical evidence is supportive of the
theory, particularly when coupled with complementary theoretical perspectives.

Origins of Agency Theory
During the 1960s and early 1970s, economists
explored risk sharing among individuals or
groups (e,g.. Arrow, 1971; Wilson, 1968). This
literature described the risk-sharing problem as
one that arises when cooperating parties have
different attitudes toward risk. Agency theory
broadened this risk-sharing literature to include
the so-called agency problem that occurs when
cooperating parties have different goals and di-

positivist and principal-agent Censen, 1983). The
two streams share a common unit of analysis:
the contract between the principal and the
agent. They also share common assumptions
about people, organizations, and information.
However, they differ in their mathematical rigor,
dependent variable, and style.
Positivist Agency Theory
Positivist researchers have focused on identifying situations in which the principal and agent
are likely to have conflicting goals and then describing the governance mechanisms that limit
the agent's self-serving behavior. Positivist research is less mathematical than principalagent research. Also, positivist researchers
have focused almost exclusively on the special
case of the principal-agent relationship between
owners and managers of large, public corporations (Berle & Means, 1932).
Three articles have been particularly influential. Jensen and Meckling (1976) explored the
ownership structure of the corporation, including how equity ownership by managers aligns
managers' interests with those of owners. Fama
(1980) discussed the role of efficient capital and
labor markets as information mechanisms that
are used to control the self-serving behavior of
top executives. Fama and Jensen (1983) described the role of the board of directors as an
information system that the stockholders within
large corporations could use to monitor the opportunism of top executives. Jensen and his colleagues (Jensen, 1984; Jensen & Roeback, 1983)
extended these ideas to controversial practices,
such as golden parachutes and corporate raiding.
From a theoretical perspective, the positivist
stream has been most concerned with describing the governance mechanisms that solve the
agency problem. Jensen (1983, p. 326) described
this interest as "why certain contractual relations arise." Two propositions capture the governance mechanisms which are identified in the
positivist stream. One proposition is that out-

such as compensation (e.g., Conlon & Parks,
1988; Eisenhardt, 1985), acquisition and diversification strategies (e.g., Amihud & Lev, 1981),
board relationships (e.g., Fama & Jensen, 1983;
Kosnik, 1987), ownership and financing structures (e.g., Argawal & Mandelker, 1987; Jensen
& Meckling, 1976), vertical integration (Anderson, 1985; Eccles, 1985), and innovation (Bolton,
1988; Zenger, 1988). Overall, the domain of
agency theory is relationships that mirror the
basic agency structure of a principal and an
agent who are engaged in cooperative behavior, but have differing goals and differing attitudes toward risk.

Agency Theory
From its roots in information economics,
agency theory has developed along two lines:

59

<-----Page 3----->come-based contracts are effective in curbing
agent opportunism. The argument is that such
contracts coalign the preferences of agents with
those of the principal because the rewards for
both depend on the same actions, and, therefore, the conflicts of self-interest between principal and agent are reduced. For example, Jensen
and Meckiing (1976) described how increasing
the firm ownership of the managers decreases
managerial opportunism. In formal terms.
Proposition I: When the contract between the
principal and agent is oufcome based, (he
agent is more likely to behave in the interests of
tbe principal.

The second proposition is that infonnation systems also curb agent opportunisn:i. The argument here is that, since information systems inform the principal about what the agent is actually doing, they are likely to curb agent opportunism because the agent will realize that he or
she cannot deceive the principal. For example,
Fama (1980) described the informcrtion effects of
efficient capital and labor markets on managerial opportunism, and Fama and Jensen (1983)
described the information role that boarc^ of directors play in controlling managerial behavior.
In formal terms.
Proposition 2: When the principal has information to verify agent behavior, the agent is more
likely io behave in the interests of the principal

At its best, positivist agency theory can be regarded as enriching economics by offering a
more complex view of organizations (Jensen,
1983). However, it has been criticized by organizational theorists as minimalist (Hirsch,
Michaels, & Friedman, 1987; Perrow, 1986) and
by microeconomists as tautological and lacking
rigor (Jensen, 1983). Nonetheless, positivist
agency theory has ignited considerable research (Barney & Ouchi, 1986) and popular interest ("Meet Mike," 1988).

Principal-Agent ReBearch
Principal-agent researchers are concerned
with a general theory of the principal-agent relationship, a theory that can be applied to employer-employee, lawyer-client, buyer-supplier,
and ether agency relationships (Harris & Raviv,
1978). Characteristic oi formal theory, the principal-agent paradigm involves careful specification of assumptions, which are followed by
logical deduction and mathematical proof.
In comparison with the positivist stream, principal-agent theory is abstract and mathematical
and, therefore, less accessible to organizational
scholars. Indeed, the most vocal critics of the
theory (Perrow, 1986; Hirsch et al., 1987) have
focused their attacks primarily on the more
widely known positivist stream. Also, the prindpal-agent stream has a broader focus and
greater interest in general, theoretical implications. In contrast, the positivist writers have focused almost exclusively on the special case of
the owner/CEO relationship in the large corporation. Finally, principal-agent research includes many more testable implications.
For organizational scholars, these differences
provide background for understanding criticism
of the theory. However, they are not crucial
Rather, the important point is that the two
streams are complementary: Positivist theory
identifies various contract alternatives, and principal-agent theory indicates which contract is
the most efficient under varying levels of outcome uncertainty, risk aversion, information,
and other variables described below.
The focus of the principal-agent literature is
on determining the optimal contract, behavior
versus outcome, between the principal and the
agent. The simple model assumes goal conflict
between principal and agent, an easily measured outcome, and an agent who is more risk
averse than the principal. (Note: The argument
behind a more risk averse agent is that agents,
who are unable to diversify their employment,
should be risk averse and principals, who are

60

<-----Page 4----->capable of diversifying their investments,
should be risk neutral.) The approach of the simple model can be described in terms of cases
(e.g., Demski 8c Feitham, 1978). The first case, a
simple case of complete information, is when the
principal knows what the agent has done.
Given that the principal is buying the agent's
behavior, then a contract that is based on behavior is meet efficient. An outcome-based contract would needlessly transfer risk to the agent,
who is assumed to be more risk averse than the
principal.
The second case is when the principal does
not know exactly what the agent has done.
Given the self-interest of the agent, the agent
may or may not have behaved as agreed. The
agency problem arises because (a) the principal
and the agent have different goals and (b) the
principal cannot determine if the agent has behaved appropriately. In the formal literature,
two aspects of the agency problem are cited.
Moral hazard refers to lack of effort on the part of
the agent. The argument here is that the agent
may simply not put forth the agreed-upon effort.
That is, the agent is shirking. For example,
moral hazard occurs when a research scientist
works on a personal research project on company time, but the research is so complex that
corporate management cannot detect what the
scientist is actually doing. Adverse selection refers to the misrepresentation of ability by the
agent. The argument here is that the agent may
claim to have certain skills or abilities when he
or she is hired. Adverse selection arises because
the principal cannot completely verify these
skills or abilities either at the time of hiring or
while the agent is working. For example, adverse selection occurs when a research scientist
claims to have experience in a scientific specialty and the employer cannot judge whether
this is the case.
In the case of unobservable behavior (due to
moral hazard or adverse selection), the principal
has two options. One is to discover the agent's
behavior by investing in information systems

61

such as budgeting systems, reporting procedures, boards of directors, and additional layers
of management. Such investments reveal the
agent's behavior to the principal, and the situation reverts to the complete information case. In
formal terms,
Proposition 3: Information systems are positively related to behavior-based contracts and
negatively related to oufcome-based contracts.
The other option is to contract on the outcomes
of the agent's behavior. Such an outcome-based
contract motivates behavior by coalignment of
the agent's preferences with those of the principal, but at the price of transferring risk to the
agent. The issue of risk arises because outcomes
are only partly a function of behaviors. Govemment policies, economic climate, competitor actions, technological change, and so on, may
cause uncontrollable variations in outcomes.
The resulting outcome uncertainty introduces
not only the inability to preplan, but also risk
that must be borne by someone. When outcome
uncertainty is low, the costs of shifting risk to the
agent are low and outcome-based contracts are
attractive. However, as uncertainty increases, it
becomes increasingly expensive to shift risk despite the motivational benefits of outcome-based
contracts. In formal terms.
Proposition 4: Outcome uncertainty is positively
related to behavior-based contracts and negatively related to outcome-based contracts.

This simple agency model has been described
in varying ways by many authors (e.g., Demski
& Feitham, 1978; Harris & Raviv, 1979; Holmstrom, 1979; Shavell, 1979). However, the heart
of principal-agent theory is the trade-off between (a) the cost of measuring behavior and (b)
the cost of measuring outcomes and transferring
risk to the agent.
A number of extensions to this simple model
are possible. One is to relax the assumption of a
risk-averse agent (e.g., Harris & Raviv, 1979).
Research (MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986) indicates that individuals vary widely in their risk

<-----Page 5----->attitudes. As the agent becomes increasingly
less risk averse (e.g., a wealthy agent), it becomes more attractive to pass risk to the agent
using an outcome-based contract. Conversely,
as the agent becomes more risk averse, it is increasingly expensive to pass risk to the agent. In
formal terms.
Proposition 5; Th& risk aversion of the agent is
positively related to behavior-based contracts
and negatively related to outcome-based contracts.
Similarly, a s the principal becomes more risk
averse, it is increasingly attractive to pass risk to
the agent. In formal terms.
Proposition 6: The risk aversion ot the principal
is negatively related to behavior-based con-

tracts and positiveJy related to outcomebased contracts.
Another extension is to relax the assumption
of goal conflict between the principal and agent
(e.g., Demski, 1980). This might occur either in a
highly socialized or clan-oriented firm (Ouchi,
1979) or in situations in which self-interest gives
way to selfless behavior (Perrow, 1986). If there
is no goal conflict, the agent will behave as the
principal would like, regardless of whether his
or her behavior is monitored. As goal conflict
decreases, there is a decreasing motivational
imperative for outcome-based contracting, and
the issue reduces to risk-sharing considerations.
Under the assumption of a risk-averse agent,
behavior-based contracts become more attractive. In formal terms,
Proposition 7: The goal conflict between principal and agent is negatively related to behaviorbased contracts and positively related to outcome-based contracts.
Another set of extensions relates to the task performed by the agent. For example, the progammability of the task is likely to influence the ease
of measuring behavior (Eisenhardt, 1985, 1988).
Programmability is defined as the degree to
which appropriate behavior by the agent can
be specified in advance. For example, the job of

a retail sales cashier is much more programmed
than that of a high-technology entrepreneur.
The argument is that the behavior of agents engaged in more programmed jobs is easier to observe and evaluate. Therefore, the more programmed the task, the more attractive are behavior-based contracts because information
about the agent's behavior is more readily determined. Very programmed tasks readily reveal agent behavior, and the situation reverts to
the complete information case. Thus, retail sales
clerks are more likely to be paid via behaviorbased contracting (e.g., hourly wages), whereas entrepreneurs are more likely to be compensated with outcome-based contracts (e.g., stock
ownership). In formal terms.
Proposition 8: TasJr programmabiiity is posi-..
tiveiy reiated to behavior-based contracts and
negatively related to outcome-based contracts.

Another task characteristic is the measurability of the outcome (Anderson, 1985; Eisenhardt,
1985). The simple model assumes that outcomes
are easily measured. However, some tasks require a long time to complete, involve joint or
team effort, or produce soft outcomes. In these
circumstances, outcomes are either difficult to
measure or difficult to measure within a practical amount of time. When outcomes are measured with difficulty, outcome-based contracts
are less attractive. In contrast, when outcomes
are readily measured, outcome-based contracts
are more attractive. In formal terms.
Proposition 9: Outcome measurability is negatively related to behavior-based contracts and
positively related to outcome-based contracts.

Finally, it seems reasonable that when principals and agents engage in a long-term relationship, it is likely that the principal will leam
about the agent (e.g., Lambert, 1983) and so will
be able to assess behavior more readily. Conversely, in short-term agency relationships, the
information asymmetry between principal and
agent is likely to be greater, thus making out-

<-----Page 6----->come-based contracts more attractive. In formal
tenns,

asymmetry is linked to the power of lower order
participants (e.g., Pettigrew, 1973). The difference is that in political models goal conflicts are
resolved through bargaining, negotiation, and
coalitionsâthe power mechanism of political
science. In agency theory they are resolved
through the coalignment of incentivesâthe
price mechanism of economics.
Agency theory also is similar to the information processing approaches to contingency theory (Chandler, 1962; Galbraith, 1973; Lawrence
& Lorsch, 1967). Both perspectives are information theories. They assume that individuals are
boundedly rational and that information is distributed asymmetrically throughout the organization. They also are efficiency theories; that is,
they use efficient processing of information as a
criterion for choosing among various organizing
forms (Galbraith, 1973). The difference between
the two is their focus: In contingency theory researchers are concerned with the optimal structuring of reporting relationships and decisionmaking responsibilities (e.g., Galbraith, 1973;
Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967), whereas in agency
theory they are concerned with the optimal
structuring of control relationships resulting
from these reporting and decision-making patterns. For example, using contingency theory,
we would be concerned with whether a firm is
organized in a divisional or matrix structure.

Proposition 10: The length of the agency relationship is positively related to behavior-based
contracts and negatively related to outcomebased contracts.

Agency Theory and the
Organizational Literature
Despite Perrow's (1986) assertion that agency
theory is very different from organization theory,
agency theory has several links to mainstream
organization perspectives (see Table 2). At its
roots, agency theory is consistent with the classic works of Barnard (1938) on the nature of cooperative behavior and March and Simon (1958)
on the inducements and contributions of the employment relationship. As in this earlier work,
the heart of agency theory is the goal conflict
inherent when individuals with differing preferences engage in cooperative effort, and the essential metaphor is that of the contract.
Agency theory is also similar to political models of organizations. Both agency and political
perspectives assume the pursuit of self-interest
at the individual level and goal conflict at the
organizational level (e.g., March, 1962; Pfeffer,
1981). Also, in both perspectives, infonnation

<-----Page 7----->Using agency theory, we would be concerned
with whether managers within the chosen structure are compensated by performance incentives.
The most obvious tie is with the organizational
control literature (e.g., Dombusch Be Scott, 1974).
For example, Thompson's (1967) and later Ouchi's (1979) Unking of known means/ends relationships and crystallized goals to behavior versus outcome control is very similar to agency
theory's Unking task programmabiUty and measurability of outcomes to contract form (Eisenhardt, 1985). That is, known means/ends relationships (task programmability) lead to behavior control, and crystallized goals (measurable
outcomes) lead to outcome control. Similarly,
Ouchi's (1979) extension of Thompsons (1967)
framework to include clan control is similar to
assuming low goal conflict (Proposition 7) in
agency theory. Clan control impUes goal congruence between people and, therefore, the reduced need to monitor behavior or outcomes.
Motivation issues disappear. The major differences between agency theory and the organizational control literature are the risk implications of principal and agent risk aversion and
outcome uncertainty (Propositions A, b, 6).
Not surprisingly, agency theory has similarities with the transaction cost perspective
(Williamson, 1975). As noted by Bomey and Ouchi (1986), the theories share assumptions of selfinterest and bounded rationality. They also
have similar dependent variables; that is, hierarchies roughly correspond to behavior-based
contracts, and markets correspond to outcomebased contracts. However, the two theories
arise from different traditions in economics
(Spence, 1975): In transaction cost theorizing we
are concerned with organizational boundaries,
whereas in agency theorizing the contract between cooperating parties, regardless of boundary, is highlighted. However, the most important difference is that each theory includes
unique independent variables. In transaction
cost theory these are asset specificity and small

64

numbers bargaining. In agency theory there
are the risk attitudes of the principal and agent,
outcome uncertainty, and information systems.
Thus, the two theories share a parentage in economics, but each has its own focus and several
unique Independent variables.

Contributions of Agency Theory
Agency theory reestablishes the importance
of incentives and seif-interest in organizaUona]
thinking (Perrow, 1986). Agency theory reminds
us that much of organizational life, whether we
like it or not, is based on self-interest. Agencytheory also emphasizes the importance of a
common problem structure across research topics. As Barney and Ouchi (1986) described it,
organization research has become increasingly
topic, rather than theory, centered. Agency theory reminds us that common problem structures
do exist across research domains. Therefore, results from one research area (e.g., vertical integration) may be germane to others with a common problem structure (e.g., compensation).
Agency theory also makes two specific contributions to organizational thinking. The first is the
treatment of information. In agency theory, information is regarded as a commodity: It has a
cost, and it can be purchased. This gives an
important role to formal information systems,
such as budgeting, MBO, and boards of directors, and informal ones, such as managerial
supervision, which is unique in organizational
research. The implication is that organizations
can invest in information systems in order to
control agent opportunism.
An illustration of this is executive compensation. A number of authois in this literature have
expressed surprise at the lack of performancebased executive compensation (e.g., Pearce,
Stevenson, & Perry, 1985; Ungson & Steers,
1984). However, from an agency perspective, il
is not surprising since such compensation
should be contingent upon a variety of factors
including information systems. Specifically,

<-----Page 8----->richer infonnation systems control managerial
opportunism and, therefore, lead to less performance-contingent pay.
One particularly relevant information system
for monitoring executive behaviors is the board
of directors. From an agency perspective, boards
can be used as monitoring devices for shareholder interests (Fama & Jensen, 1983). When
boards provide richer information, compensation is less likely to be based on firm performance. Rather, because the behaviors of top executives are better known, compensation based
on knowledge of executive behaviors is more
likely. Executives would then be rewarded for
taking well-conceived actions (e.g., high
risk/high potential R&D) whose outcomes may
be unsuccessful. Also, when boards provide
richer information, top executives are more
likely to engage in behaviors that are consistent
with stockholders' interests. For example, from
an agency viewpoint, behaviors such as using
greenmail and golden parachutes, which tend
to benefit the manager more than the stockholders, are less likely when boards are better monitors of stockholders' interests. Operationally,
the richness of board information can be measured in terms of characteristics such as frequency of board meetings, number of board
subcommittees, number of board members with
long tenure, number of board members with
managerial and industry experience, and number of board members representing specific
ownership groups.

viewed in terms of risk/reward trade-offs, not just
in terms of inability to preplan. The implication
is that outcome uncertainty coupled with differences in willingness to accept risk should influence contracts between principal and agent.
Vertical integration provides an illustration.
For example. Walker and Weber (1984) found
that technological and demand uncertainty did
not affect the "make or buy" decision for components in a large automobile manufacturer (principal in this case). The authors were unable to
explain their results using a transaction cost
framework. However, their results are consistent
with agency thinking if the managers of the automobile firm are risk neutral (a reasonable assumption given the size of the automobile firm
relative to the importance of any single component). According to agency theory, we would
predict that such a risk-neutral principal is relatively uninfluenced by outcome uncertainty,
which was Walker and Weber's result.
Conversely, according to agency theory, the
reverse prediction is true for a new venture. In
this case, the firm is small and new, and it has
limited resources available to it for weathering
uncertainty: The likelihood of failure looms
large. In this case, the managers of the venture
may be risk-averse principals. If so, according to
agency theory we would predict that such managers will be very sensitive to outcome uncertainty. In pariicuiar, the managers would be
more likely to choose the "buy" option, thereby
transferring risk to the supplying firm. Overall,
agency theory predicts that risk-neutral managers are likely to choose the "make" option (behavior-based contract), whereas risk-averse executives are likely to choose "buy" (outcomebased contract).

A second contribution of agency theory is its
risk implications. Organizations are assumed to
have uncertain futures. The future may bring
prosperity, bankruptcy, or some intermediate
outcome, and that future is only partly controlled
by organization members. Environmental effects such as government regulation, emergence of new competitors, and technical Innovation can affect outcomes. Agency theory extends organizational thinking by pushing the
ramifications of outcome uncertainty to their
implications for creating risk. Uncertainty is

Empirical Results
Researchers in several disciplines have undertaken empirical studies of agency theory.

In the positivisf stream, the common approach
is to Identify a policy or behavior in which stockholder and management interests diverge and
then to demonstrate that information systems or
outcome-based incentives solve the agency
problem. That is, these mechanisms coaUgn

Consistent with the positivist tradition, most of
these studies concern the separation of ownership from management in large corporations,
and they use secondary source data that are

One of the earliest studies of this type was
conducted by Amihud and Lev (1981). These researchers explored why firms engage in conglomerate mergers. In general, conglomerate
mergers are not in the interests of the stockholders because, typically, stockholders can diversify directly through their stock portfolio. In contrast, conglomerate mergers may be attractive
to manageTS who have fewer avenues available
to diversify their own risk. Hence, conglomerate
mergers are an arena in which owner and manager interests diverge. Specifically, these authors linked merger and diversification behaviors to whether the firm was owner controlled (i.e.,
had a major stockholder) or manager controlled
(i.e., had no major stockholder). Consistent with
agency theory arguments (Jensen & Meckling,
1976), manager-controlled firms engaged in significantly more conglomerate (but not more related) acquisitions and were more diversified.
Along the same lines. Walking and Long
(1984) studied managers' resistance to takeover
bids. Their sample included 105 large U.S. corporations that were targets of takeover attempts
between 1972 and 1977. In general, resistance to
takeover bids is not in the stockholders' interests,
but it may be in the interests of managers because they can lose their jobs during a takeover.
Consistent with agency theory Qensen & MeckUng, 1976), the authors found that managere
who have substantial equity positions within

their firms (outcome-based contracts) were less
likely to resist takeover bids.
The effects of market discipline on agency relationships were examined in Wolfson's (1985)
study of the relationship between the limited
(principals) and general (agent) partners in oil
and gas tax shelter programs. In this study, both
tax and agency effects were combined in order
to assess why the limited partnership governance form survived in this setting despite extensive information advantages and divergent
incentives for the limited partner. Consistent
with agency arguments (Fama, 1980), Wolfson
found that long-run reputation effects of the market coallgned the short-run behaviors of the general partner with the limited partners' welfare.
Kosnik (1987) examined another information
mechanism for managerial opportunism, the
board of directors. Kosnik studied 110 large U.S.
corporations that were greenmail targets between 1979 and 1983. Using both hegemony and
agency theories, she related board characteristics to whether greenmail was actually paid
(paying greenmail is considered not in the stockholders' interests). As predicted by agency theory (Fama & Jensen, 1983), boards of companies
that resisted greenmail had a higher proportion
of outside directors and a higher proportion of
outside director executives.
In a similar vein, Argawal and Mandelker
(1987) examined whether executive holdings of
firm securities reduced agency problems between stockholders and management. Specifically, they studied the relationship between
stock and stock option holdings of executives
and whether acquisition and financing decisions were made consistent with the interests of
stockholders. In general, managers prefer lower
risk acquisitions and lower debt financing (see
Argawal & Mandelker, 1987, for a review). Their
sample included 209 firms that participated in
acquisitions and divestitures between 1974 and
1982. Consistent with agency ideas (e.g., Jensen
& Meckling, 1976), executive security holdings
(outcome-based contract) were related to acqm-

<-----Page 12----->port the positivist propositions described earlier.
Similarly, laboratory studies by Dejong and colleagues (1985), which are not reviewed here,
are also supportive.

sition and financing decisiorxs that were
consistent with stockholder interest. That is, executive stock holdings appeared to coalign
managerial preferences with those of stockholders.
Singh and Harianto (in press) studied golden
parachutes in a matched sample of 84 Fortune
500 firms. Their study included variables from
both agency and managerialist perspectives.
Consistent with agency theory Gensen & Meckling, 1976; Fama & Jensen, 1983), the authors
found that golden parachutes are used to coaUgn
executive interests with those of stockholders in
takeover situations, and they are seen as an altemative outcome-based contract to executive
stock ownership. Specifically, the authors found
that golden parachutes were positively associated with a higher probability of a takeover attempt and negatively associated with executive
stock holdings.
Finally, Barney (1988) explored whether employee stock ownership reduces a firm's cost of
equity capital. Consistent with agency theory
Gensen & Meckling, 1976), Barney argued that
employee stock ownership (outcome-based contract) would coaUgn the interests of employees
with stockholders. Using efficient capital market
assumptions, he further argued that this coaUgnment would be reflected in the market through a
lower cost of equity. Although Barney did not
directly test the agency argument, the results
are consistent with an agency view.
In summary, there is support for the existence
of agency problems between shareholders and
top executives across situations in which their
interests divergeâthat is, takeover attempts,
debt versus equity financing, acquisitions, and
divestitures, and for the mitigation of agency
problems (a) through outcome-based contracts
such as golden parachutes (Singh & Harianto,
m press) and executive stock holdings (Argawal
& Mandelker, 1987; Walking & Long, 1984) and
(b) through information systems such as boards
(Kosnik, 1987) and efficient markets (Barney,
1988; Wolfson, 1985). OveraU, these studies sup-

Results of the Principal-Agent Stream
The principal-agent stream is more directly focused on the contract between the principal and
the agent. Whereas the positivist stream lays the
foundation (that is, that agency problems exist
and that various contract alternatives are available), the principal-agent stream indicates the
most efficient contract altemative in a given situation. The common approach in these studies
is to use a subset of agency variables such as
task programmability, information systems, and
outcome unceriainty to predict whether the contract is behavior- or outcome-based. The underlying assumption is that principals and agents
will choose the most efficient contract, although
efficiency is not directly tested.
In one study, Anderson (1985) probed vertical
integration using a transaction cost perspective
with agency variables. Specifically, she examined the choice between a manufacturer's representative (outcome-based) and a corporate
sales force (behavior-based) among a sample of
electronics firms. The most powerful explanatory variable was from agency theory: the difficulty of measuring outcomes (measured by
amount of nonselling tasks and joint team sales).
Consistent with agency predictions, this variable was positively related to using a corporate
sales force (behavior-based contract).
In other studies, Eisenhardt (1985, 1988) examined the choice between commission (outcomebased) and salary (behavior-based) compensation of salespeople in retaiUng. The original
study (1985) included only agency variables,
while a later study (1988} added additional
agency variables and institutional theory predictions. The results supported agency theory
predictions that task programmability, information systems (measured by the span of control),
and outcome uncertainty variables (measured

69

<-----Page 13----->by number of competitors and failure rates) significantly predict the salary versus commission
choice. Institutional variables were significant
as well.
Conlon and Parks (1988) repUcated and extended Eisenhardt's work in a laboratory setting. They used a multiperiod design to test both
agency and institutional predictions. Consistent
with agency theory (Harris & Raviv, 1978), they
found that information systems (manipulated by
whether or not the principal could monitor the
agent's behavior) were negatively related to
performance-contingent (outcome-based) pay.
They also found support for the institutional predictions.
Finally, Eccles (1985) used agency theory to
develop a framework for understanding transfer
pricing. Using interviews with 150 executives in
13 large corporations, he developed a framework based on notions of agency and faimess to
prescribe the conditions under which various
sourclng and transfer pricing altematives are
both efficient and equitable. Prominent in his
framework is the link between decentralization
(arguably a measure of task programmability)
and the choice between cost (behavior-based
contract) and market (outcome-based contract)
transfer pricing mechanisms.
In summary, there is support for the principalagent hypotheses linking contract form with (a)
information systems (Conlon & Parks, 1988; Eccles, 1985; Eisenhardt, 1985), (b) outcome uncertainty (Eisenhardt, 1985), (c) outcome measurability (Anderson, 1985; Eisenhardt, 1985), (d)
time (Conlon & Parks, 1988), and (e) task programmability (Eccles, 1985; Eisenhardt, 1985).
Moreover, this support rests on research using a
variety of methods including questionnaires,
secondary sources, laboratory experiments,
and interviews.

has empirical support. Overall, it seems reasonable to urge the adoption of an agency theory
perspective when investigating the many problems that have a principal-agent structure. Five
specific recommendations are outUned below
for using agency theory in organizational research.
Focus on Information Systems, Outcome
Uncertainty, and Risk
McGrath, Martin, and Kukla (1981) argued
that research is a knowledge accrual process.
Using this accrual criterion, next steps for
agency theory research are clear: Researchers
should focus on information systems, outcome
uncertainty, and risk. These agency variables
make the most unique contribution to organizational research, yet they have received little empirical attention (Table 3). It is important that researchers place emphasis on these variables in
order to advance agency theory and to provide
new concepts in the study of familiar topics such
as impression management, innovation, vertical integration, compensation, strategic alliances, and board relationships.
Studying risk and outcome uncertainty is particularly opportune because of recent advances
in measuring risk preferences. By relying on the
works of Kahneman and Tversky (1979), MacCrimmon and Wehrung (1986), and March and
Shapira (1987), the organizational researcher
can measure risk preference more easily and
realistically. These techniques include direct
measures of risk preference such as lotteries and
indirect measures using demographic characteristics such as age and wealth and payoff
characteristics such as gain versus loss. (See
March and Shapira, 1987, for a review.)
Key on Theory-Relevant Contexts
Organizational theory usually is explored in
settings in which the theory appears to have
greatest relevance. For example, institutional
and resource dependence theories were developed primarily in large, public bureaucracies in
which efficiency may not have been a pressing

Recommendations for Agency
Theory Research
As argued above, agency theory makes contributions to organization theory, is testable, and
70

<-----Page 14----->concem. The recommendation here is to take
the same approach with agency theory: Key on
theory-relevant contexts.
Agency theory is most relevant in situations in
which contracting problems are difficult. These
include situations in which there is (a) substantial goal conflict between principals and agents,
such that agent opporiunism is likely (e.g., owners and managers, managers and professionals, suppliers and buyers); (b) sufficient outcome
uncertainty to trigger the risk implications of the
theory (e.g., new product innovation, young
and small firms, recently deregulated industries); and (c) unprogrammed or team-oriented
jobs in which evaluation of behaviors is difficult.
By emphasizing these contexts, researchers can
use agency theory where it can provide the most
leverage and where it can be most rigorously
tested. Topics such as innovation and settings
such as technology-based firms are pariicularly
attractive because they combine goal conflict
between professionals and managers, risk, and
jobs in which performance evaluation Is difficult.

The second area is expansion beyond the
pure forms of behavior and outcome contracts as
described in this article to a broader range of contract altematives. Most research (e.g., Anderson,
1985; Eisenhardt, 1985, 1988) treats contracts as a
dichotomy: behavior versus outcome. However,
contracts can vary on a continuum between behavior and outcome contracts, Also, current research focuses on a single reward, neglecting
many situations In which there are multiple rewards, differing by time frame and contract basis. For example, upper level managers usually
are compensated through multiple rewards
such as promotions, stock options, and salary.
Both multiple and mixed rewards (behavior and
outcome) present empirical difficulties, but they
also mirror real life. The richness and complexity of agency theory would be enhanced if researchers would consider this broader spectrum
of possible contracts.
Use Multiple Theories
A recent article by Hirsch et al. (1987) eloquently compared economics with sociology.
They argued that economics is dominated by a
single paradigm, price theory, and a single
view of human nature, self-interest. In contrast,
the authors maintained that a strength of organizational research is its polyglot of theories that
yields a more realistic view of organizations.
Consistent with the Hirsch et al. arguments,
the recommendation here is fo use agency theory with complementary theories. Agency theory presents a partial view of the world that,
although it is valid, also ignores a good bit of the
complexity of organizations. Additional perspectives can help to capture the greater complexity.
This point is demonstrated by many of the empirical studies reviewed above. For example,
the Singh and Harianto (in press) and Kosnik
(1987) studies support agency theory hypotheses, but they also use the complementary perspectives of hegemony and managerialism.
These perspectives emphasize the power and political aspects of golden parachutes and green-

Expand to Richer Contexts
Perrow (1986) and others have criticized agency
theory for being excessively narrow and having
few testable implications. Although these criticisms may be extreme, they do suggest that research should be undertaken in new areas.
Thus, the recommendation is io expand to a
richer and more complex range of contexts.
Two areas are particularly appropriate. One
is to apply the agency structure to organizational behavior topics that relate to information
asymmetry (or deception) in cooperative situations. Examples of such topics are impression
management (Gardner & Martinko, 1988), lying
and other forms of secrecy (Sitkin, 1987), and
blame (Leatherwood & Conlon, 1987). Agency
theory might contribute an overall framework in
which to place these various forms of selfinterest, leading to a better understanding of
[when such behaviors will be likely and when
Pthey will be effective.
71

<-----Page 15----->mail, respectively. Similarly, the studies by
Eisenhardt (1988) and Conlon and Parks (1988)
combine institutional and agency theories. The
institutional emphasis on tradition complements
the efficiency emphasis of agency theory, and
the result is a better understanding of compensation. Other examples include Anderson (1985),
who coupled agency and transaction cost, and
Eccles (1985), who combined agency with equity
theory.
Look Beyond Economics

The final recommendation is that organizational researchers should look beyond the economics literature. The advantages of economics
are careful development of assumptions and
logical propositions (Hirsch et al., 1987). However, much of this careful theoretical development has already been accomplished for agency
theory. For organizational researchers, the payoff now is in empirical research, where organizational researchers have comparative advantage (Hirsch et al., 1987). To rely too heavily on
economics with its restrictive assumptions such
as efficient markets and its single-perspective

style is toriskdoing second-rate economics without contributing first-rate organizational research. Therefore, although it is appropriate to
monitor developments in economics, it is more
useful to treat economics as an adjunct to more
mainstream empirical work by organizational
scholars.

Conclusion
This paper began with two extreme positions
on agency theoryâone arguing that agency
theory is revolutionary and a powerful foundation (Jensen, 1983) and the other arguing that the
theory addresses no clear problem, is narrow,
lacks testable implications, and is dangerous
(Perrow, 1986). A more vaUd perspective lies in
the middle. Agency theory provides a unique,
reaUstic, and empirically testable perspective
on problems of cooperative effort. The intent oi
this paper is to clarify some of the confusion surrounding agency theory and to lead organizational scholars to use agency theory in their
study of the broad range of principal-agent issues facing firms.
