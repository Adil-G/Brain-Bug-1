A SIMPLE MODEL OF HERD BEHAVIOR*
ABHIJIT

V.

BANERJEE

We analyze a sequential decision model in which each decision maker looks at
the decisions made by previous decision makers in taking her own decision. This is
rational for her because these other decision makers may have some information
that is important for her. We then show that the decision rules that are chosen by
optimizing individuals will be characterized by herd behavior; i.e., people will be
doing what others are doing rather than using their information. We then show that
the resulting equilibrium is inefficient.

I. INTRODUCTION

There are innumerable social and economic situations in
which we are influenced in our decision making by what others
around us are doing. Perhaps the commonest examples are from
everyday life: we often decide on what stores and restaurants to
patronize or what schools to attend on the basis of how popular
they seem to be. But it has been suggested by Keynes [1936], for
example, that this is also how investors in asset markets often
behave (the famous "beauty contest" example).' In the literature
on fertility choices it has frequently been suggested that various
fertility decisions (how many children to have, whether or not to
use contraception, etc.) are heavily influenced by what other people
in the same area are doing.2 It has also been suggested that the
same kind of factor also influences the decision to adopt new

technologies.3 Voters are known to be influenced by opinion polls to
vote in the direction that the poll predicts will win; this is another
instance of going with the flow.4 The same kind of influence is also
at work when, for example, academic researchers choose to work
on a topic that is currently "hot."
The aim of this paper is to develop a simple model in which we
can study the rationale behind this kind of decision making as well
as its implications. We set up a model in which paying heed to what
everyone else is doing is rational because their decisions may reflect
information that they have and we do not. It then turns out that a
likely consequence of people trying to use this information is what
we call herd behavior-everyone doing what everyone else is doing,
even when their private information suggests doing something
quite different.
But this suggests that the very act of trying to use the
information contained in the decisions made by others makes each
person's decision less responsive to her own information and hence
less informative to others. Indeed, we find that in equilibrium the
reduction of informativeness may be so severe that in an ex ante
welfare sense society may actually be better off by constraining
some of the people to use only their own information.
A common real world example may make our basic argument
clearer.5 Most of us have been in a situation where we have to
choose between two restaurants that are both more or less
unknown to us. Consider now a situation where there is a
population of 100 people who are all facing such a choice.
There are two restaurants A and B that are next to each other,
and it is known that the prior probabilities are 51 percent for
restaurant A being the better and 49 percent for restaurant B being
better. People arrive at the restaurants in sequence, observe the
choices made by the people before them, and decide on one or the
other of the restaurants. Apart from knowing the prior probabilities, each of these people also got a signal which says either that A
is better or that B is better (of course the signal could be wrong). It
is also assumed that each person's signal is of the same quality.
Suppose that of the 100 people, 99 have received signals that B
is better but the one person whose signal favors A gets to choose
first. Clearly, the first person will go to A. The second person will
now know that the first person had a signal that favored A, while

her own signal favors B. Since the signals are of equal quality, they
effectively cancel out, and the rational choice is to go by the prior
probabilities and go to A.
The second person thus chooses A regardless of her signal.
Her choice therefore provides no new information to the next
person in line: the third person's situation is thus exactly the same
as that of the second person, and she should make the same choice
and so on. Everyone ends up at restaurant A even if, given the
aggregate information, it is practically certain that B is better.
To see what went wrong, notice that if instead the second
person had been someone who always followed her own signal, the
third person would have known that the second person's signal had
favored B. The third person would then have chosen B, and so
would have everybody else.
The second person's decision to ignore her own information
and join the herd therefore inflicts a negative externality on the
rest of the population. If she had used her own information, her
decision would have provided information to the rest of the
population, which would have encouraged them to use their own
information as well. As it is, they all join the herd.
The identification of this externality, which we call "herd
externality," and the investigation of what it implies, is the main
contribution of this paper. The model we present is extremely
simple and does not aspire to capture any specific institutional
detail. There is a set of options represented by a line segment, and
within this set there is one correct option. The aim of the game is to
find the correct option. All those who find the correct option get z,
while all others get 0. There is a population of N people who take
their decisions in a fixed order; each person moves knowing the
choices made by those before her but not the information these
choices were based on. Each individual may either be uninformed,
in which case she has no signal, or informed, in which case she has
a signal about what the right option is. This signal, however, may
not be correct. It is correct only with probability 1; otherwise it is
completely uninformative. Everybody is rational in the Bayesian
sense, and the equilibrium we look at is a Bayesian-Nash
equilibriums
Because of the extreme simplicity of this model, using quite
6. This formulation is somewhat more complicated and somewhat less natural
than the two-restaurant setting discussed above, but it turns out that deriving a
general result about the equilibrium decision rule which holds for all parameter
values is actually simpler in this setting.

elementary arguments we are able to derive a number of rather
striking results that derive directly from the presence of the herd
externality. These results are summarized below.
1. The equilibrium pattern of choices may be (and for a large
enough population, will be) inefficient in the ex ante welfare sense.
Before people know the order in which they are choosing, they may
all agree to prevent the first few decision makers from observing
the choices made by anyone else. This is a direct consequence of the
herd externality and suggests why herd behavior may be undesirable from the social point of view.
2. The probability that no one in the population chooses the
correct option is bounded away from zero for any size of the
population. Indeed, by making the probability 3 small, we can
make this probability as large as we like. This contrasts with the
case where the decision makers choose without looking at each
other (i.e., they follow their own information). Since the information they have is independent, as long as the population is large
enough, someone must choose the right option in this case.
3. Since the herd externality is of the positive feedback type (if
we join the crowd, we induce others to do the same), the equilibrium pattern of choices will be very volatile across several plays of
the same game. The signals (which are partly random and need not
be correct) that the first few decision makers have will determine
where the first crowd forms, and from then on, everybody joins the
crowd. This may shed some light on observations of "excess
volatility" made in the context of many asset markets7 and the
frequent and apparently unpredictable changes in fashions.
The emphasis on the herd externality also distinguishes our
work from two other explanations of clustering behavior that have
been suggested before. One is an explanation based on strong
complementarities: some things are more worthwhile when others
are doing related things.8 Examples of such complementarities are
fashions in consumption (see, for example, the analysis of fashions
in Karni and Schmeidler [1989]) and network externalities in
production (see Arthur [1989], Farrell and Saloner [1985], and
Katz and Shapiro [1985]). Whether or not it is as important in
7. The idea that informational externalities may explain observations of excess
volatility is also discussed in Banerjee [1988].
8. As far as we know, there is actually no formal model that tries to explain
herd behavior in these terms; what exists in the literature is the idea that if
complementarities are sufficiently large, then people will do what the crowd is doing
even if left to themselves they would have done something else. Under suitable
conditions this could clearly lead to herd behavior.

<-----Page 5----->A SIMPLE MODEL OF HERD BEHAVIOR

other contexts where we observe herd behavior is an open question.
In any case, there is no contradiction between this view and ours;
our point is that many aspects of herd behavior can be explained
quite plausibly without invoking these kinds of gains from
association.
A different explanation of herd behavior, which, like the
present work is based on informational asymmetries, was suggested in an interesting recent paper by Scharfstein and Stein
[1990]. The key difference between their explanation and the one
suggested here is that their explanation is based on an agency
problem; in their model the agents get rewards for convincing a
principal that they are right. This distortion in incentives plays an
important role in generating herd behavior in their model. By
contrast, in our model agents capture all of the returns generated
by their choice so that there is no distortion in incentives.9
In any case, this approach is not inconsistent with our
approach. This kind of principal agent problem (trying to con
someone else into believing that you know something) seems
common enough, especially in the context of asset markets. On the
other hand, in many of the other potential instances of herd
behavior, such as fertility choices, adoption of innovations, voting
etc., there is no obvious principal agent problem. It is therefore
useful to establish that inefficient herd behavior can arise even
when the individuals themselves capture the rewards from their
decisions.
The strategy of this paper is as follows: the basic model is
presented in Section II and analyzed in Section III. The results are
discussed in Section IV. Several extensions and modifications of the
basic model are presented in Section V. We conclude in Section VI.
The essential ideas in this paper are generally quite straightforward. Nonetheless, a fully rigorous treatment of the results derived
here will certainly be very cumbersome and repetitive. To prevent
the paper from being too unreadable, we have omitted some proofs
9. There are two other important differences between the two models. In the
Scharfstein and Stein model unlike in ours, all agents get a signal. However, only
some of these signals are potentially informative (though not necessarily correct):
the rest are duds; and the agents cannot distinguish between the two types of signals.
In our model this would amount to assuming that agents do not know whether they
have a signal or not. The decision to herd and not use one's signal is therefore
somewhat less significant (since they actually may not have a signal) than it is in our
model (where they know they have a signal). On the other hand, it is possible to
generate instances of herd behavior in their model even if there are only two agents.
In the model given here the equilibrium is always (second-best) optimal if there are
two agents.

and presented others informally. More rigorous proofs were presented in an earlier version of this paper [Banerjee, 1989], which is
available from the author.
II. THE BASIC MODEL

There is a population of agents of size N each of whom
maximizes the identical risk-neutral utility function VNM10 defined on the space of asset returns. For convenience we shall just
assume that this utility is the same as the monetary amount
received by the person.
There is a set of assets indexed by numbers in [0,1] . Call the ith
asset a(i). The physical return to the ith asset to the nth person
investing in that asset is z(i) E R. Let us assume that there is a
unique i* such that z(i) = 0 for all i ? i* and z(i*) = z, where z > 0.
This is essentially the assumption that the excess return on one
asset to the people investing in it is strictly greater than that on all
other assets.
Of course, everybody, given these payoffs, would want to invest
in i*. The trouble is no one knows which one it is. We assume
uniform priors so there is not even a likely candidate for i*.
However, some people have an idea of which one it might be.
Formally, there is a probability x that each person receives a signal
telling her that the true i* is i'. The signal need not, of course, be
true, and the probability that it is false is 1 - P. If it is false, then
we assume that it is uniformly distributed on [0,1] and therefore
gives no information about what i* really is.
The decision making in this model is sequential; one person
chosen at random takes her decision first (she cannot decide to
delay her decision). The next person, once again chosen at random,
takes her decision next but she is allowed to observe the choice
made by the previous person and can benefit from the information
contained in it. However, she is not allowed to find out whether or
not the person before her actually got a signal.11
The rest of the game proceeds in the same way, with each new
decision maker making her decision on the basis of the history of
the past decisions and their own signal if they have one. After
everybody has made her choice, all the alternatives that have been
10. It will be evident that for much of what we say it is irrelevant whether we
take our utility function to be risk neutral or risk averse. The only point where we
need the assumption is when we measure ex ante welfare.

chosen are tested, and if any of these turn out to work, those who
have chosen it receive their rewards. If no one has chosen an option
that works, the truth remains undiscovered, and no one gets
rewards.
It will be assumed that the structure of the game and Bayesian
rationality are common knowledge. Each person's strategy is a
decision rule that tells us for each possible history what that person
will choose. We are looking for a Bayesian Nash equilibrium in
these strategies. The nature of the equilibrium play, however,
turns out to depend on certain critical tie-breaking assumptions.
Some of these assumptions may be dispensed with by strengthening the equilibrium concept, but it seems more natural to introduce
these as explicit assumptions. These assumptions are listed below;
the relevance of these assumptions will become clear in the
appropriate context. It should also be possible to see that each of
these assumptions is made to minimize the possibility of herding.
ASSUMPTION
A. Whenever a decision maker has no signal and
everyone else has chosen i = 0, she always chooses i = 0.
B. When decision makers are indifferent between

following their own signal and following someone else's choice,
they always follow their own signal.12
ASSUMPTION
C. When a decision maker is indifferent between
following more than one of the previous decision makers, she
chooses to follow the one who has the highest value of i.

III. THE EQUILIBRIuM DECISION RULE

The first decision maker's decision will

choice minimizes

12. This assumption is not entirely innocuous. If the third decision maker
decides to follow the second independently of her informational situation, the fact
that she follows provides no information to the next decision maker. The next
decision maker who has a signal, now faces the same choice; she is indifferent
between following her own signal and joining the second and the third decision
maker. If she too ignores her own signal, the next decision once again has the same
choice and so on. There could, for example, be an equilibrium in which almost
everybody follows either the first decision maker or the first deviant. Since this
involves even more herding than the equilibrium we describe above, its welfare
properties will typically be worse; and in this sense by making the above tiebreaking assumption, we are choosing to focus on the best of the set of possible
equilibria.

misinformation: the only case where this will cause confusion is
when i* = 0, but since this happens with probability 0, we can
ignore this possibility.13
If the second decision maker has no signal, then she will of
course imitate the first decision maker and invest in the same
asset. However, if she has a signal and the first person has not
chosen i = 0, she has a problem. She knows that the first decision
maker had a signal and this signal is as likely to be right as her own
signal. She is therefore indifferent between following the first
decision maker's signal and following her own signal. In this
situation our Assumption B becomes relevant.'4 By invoking this
assumption, we determine that the second person will, in this case,
follow her own signal.
The third decision maker can observe four possible histories:
one or both of her predecessors may have chosen i = 0, and if
neither of them had chosen i = 0, they could have still either agreed
or disagreed. If they both chose i = 0, the third person should
follow them if she has no signal and follow her signal otherwise. In
all the other cases, if she does not have a signal, she should follow
the person who has not chosen i = 0. If both the others have chosen
i ? 0 but have not agreed with each other, of course this does not
determine a course of action. Since she is indifferent, however, we
can invoke our third tie-breaking rule, Assumption C, which tells
us that she should follow the person with the highest i.
On the other hand, if the third decision maker does have a
signal i', she will follow her own signal, unless both people before
her have chosen the same option and this option is neither i = 0 nor
i = i'. When both of her predecessors have chosen i = 0, this is
obvious. When only one of them has chosen something different
from i = 0 and i = i' and the other has chosen i = 0, this is a
consequence of our Assumption B. And, of course, when the third
person's signal matches the choices made by one or both of her
predecessors, she must choose to follow her own signal since this
could not happen unless her signal was correct.
The last point is much more general than this specific situation and deserves to be emphasized. Whenever some person's
signal matches the choice made by one of her predecessors, she
should always follow her signal. This follows from the fact that the
probability that two people should get the same signal and yet both
13. Of course, there is nothing special about the point 0. The person could just
as well choose some other point i as long as everybody knows what i is.
14. Once again, this assumption is not entirely innocuous.

be wrong is zero. To deal with the remaining case, we prove the
following simple lemma.
LEMMA 1. If the first and the second decision makers have both

chosen the same F X 0, the third decision maker should choose
to follow them.
Proof of Lemma 1. Note that
prob[i* = TIH] = {a332(1 - A) + a23(1prob[i* = i' H] = {a2,8(1 - p)(1-

)(1 - oa}/prob[H]
o)/prob[H],

where H represents the event in which the first two people have
both chosen I and the third person has the signal i'.
Clearly, the first term is greater than the second. The third
person should therefore choose i.
Q.E.D.
This has a simple intuitive explanation: the third person
knows that the first person must have a signal, since otherwise she
would have chosen i = 0. The first person's choice is therefore at
least as good as the third person's signal. Further, the first person
has someone who has followed her. This is some extra support for
the first person's choice, since it is more likely to happen when the
first person is right than when she is wrong. It is therefore always
better to follow the first person.
The same intuition tells us what should happen in any
situation when several options other than i = 0 have been chosen
but only one of them has been chosen by two people. Assume that
the next person does not have a signal that matches any of the
options that have already been chosen (if she has a signal that
matches someone else's choice, she should, of course, follow her
own signal). In the situation where this option is not the one with
the highest i, it is of course clear (by our Assumption C) that both
those people must have the same signal and therefore they must be
right. In the situation where it is the one who has the highest i, the
argument in the previous paragraph applies, and therefore once
again this option is the best. In either case, therefore, the next
person should choose the option that has been chosen by two
people.
Once one option has been chosen by two people, the next
person should always follow that option unless her signal matches
one of the options that have been already chosen; in that case she

<-----Page 10----->806

QUARTERLYJOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

should follow her own signal. A combination of this decision rule
with Assumption C tells us that the next person will observe one of
three alternative histories.
i) One option (other than i = 0) has been chosen by more than
one person, and this is the one that has the highest i.
ii) One option (other than i = 0) has been chosen by more than
one person, and this is not the one with the highest i.
iii) Two options (other than i = 0) have been chosen by more
than one person, one of which is the one with the highest i.
In the second and the third scenarios, it is clear that the option
which is not the highest value of i is the correct option, and all
subsequent decision makers should choose it. The argument in the
first case is very similar to the argument for Lemma 1. The next
decision maker should decide to follow the option that has already
been chosen by more than one person.
The same argument can now be extended to all subsequent
decision makers. This yields the following proposition which
summarizes all the arguments we make above.15
1. Under Assumptions A, B, and C, the unique
(Nash) equilibrium decision rule that everyone will adopt is
decision rule D16given below.
1. The first decision maker follows her signal if she has one
and chooses i = 0 otherwise.
2. For k > 1, if the kth decision maker has a signal, she will
choose to follow her own signal either if and only if (a) holds or
if (a) does not hold, (b) holds, where (a) and (b) are given below.
(a) Her signal matches some option that has already been
chosen.
(b) No option other than i = 0 has been chosen by more than
one person.
3. Assume that the kth decision maker has a signal. If any
option (among those already chosen) other than the one with

PROPOSITION

15. A formal proof is available from the author on request.
16. Actually this is not the full decision rule. Technically we have to specify the
optimal decision in other parts of the decision tree. In particular, we have to specify
the decision rule in the following scenario: one person finds that his option matches
someone else's and chooses that option. In the equilibrium specified it is known that
he would not choose that option unless his signal matches that option. Therefore,
everybody else follows him expecting that no one else will deviate. However, now
someone else deviates and chooses another of the options that have already been
chosen.
It is true that this can happen only with probability zero, but when it happens,
we need to say what the subsequent decision makers will choose. However, it turns
out that agents are actually indifferent between sticking to the original path and
deviating to the new one, and we can make any assumption we like.

<-----Page 11----->A SIMPLE MODEL OF HERD BEHAVIOR

807

the highest i has been chosen by more than one person, the kth
decision maker will choose this option, unless her signal
matches one of the other options that has already been chosen.
In this case she chooses the latter option.
4. Assume that the kth decision maker has a signal. If the
option with the highest i (among those already chosen) has
been chosen by more than one person and no other option
(except i = 0) has been chosen by more than one person, she
will choose this option unless her signal matches one of the
options already chosen. In this case she chooses the latter
option.
5. Assume that the kth decision maker does not have a signal.
Then she will choose i = 0 if and only if that is what everyone
else has chosen. Otherwise, she chooses the option with the
highest value of i that has already been chosen unless one of
the other options (excluding i = 0) has been chosen by more
than one person. In this case, she chooses the latter option.
The only part of the statement of this proposition that is not
explained above is the uniqueness. Because each person's payoff is
completely independent of the choices made by everyone coming
after her in the decision process, there are no strategic elements
here, and we can solve this game by moving forward in the game
tree. The uniqueness of the solution is therefore automatically
guaranteed.
The equilibrium decision rule as stated above is somewhat
complicated and potentially confusing. In Figure I the decision rule
for decision maker k (for k > 2) is presented in a schematic form
that may be easier to follow.

IV. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

A. Description of the Equilibrium
The equilibrium decision rule in the above model is characterized by extensive herding; agents abandon their own signals and
follow others even when they are not really sure that the other
person is right. The first person always follows her own signal if
she has one, and so does the second person, but we cannot
guarantee that even the third person follows her own signal. If the
first person chooses i ? 0 and the second person follows her, the
third person will always follow them. All subsequent decision
makers will also choose the same option.

Herding can also happen when the first and second person,
and for that matter the third and fourth person, choose different
options. After k different options have been chosen, for any positive
k, if the next decision maker does not have a signal, she will choose
the option with the highest value of i (among those already
chosen). Following this, all subsequent decision makers will choose
the same option unless one of their signals matches one of the
options already chosen. This can happen only if the correct option
has already been chosen. So, there will be herding at an incorrect
option unless the first decision maker to have a signal or someone
coming after her but before the first subsequent decision maker
without a signal, made the correct choice.
We can actually calculate the expression for the probability
that no one in the population chooses the right option, however
large the population. A simple calculation establishes that this
probability is
[1 -

(1

-

)]-1(1

-

&(1

-

A).

This probability is clearly decreasing in both a and 3 which
makes intuitive sense. Further, if 3 is sufficiently small, this
probability will be very close to one.
To see why this is worth a remark, note that if all the decision
makers took their decisions without observing the choices made by
others, some people will always end up choosing the correct option
(in fact, for a large enough population, the proportion of the

<-----Page 13----->A SIMPLE MODEL OF HERD BEHAVIOR

809

population who will choose the correct option will almost certainly
be close to (up).
It is also important to note that just the fact that people
observe the decisions made by others does not guarantee that there
will be herd behavior. Consider, for example, the following modified version of the Normal Learning Model: there is a Normal
(Gaussian) distribution with known variance but unknown mean.
The distribution of the mean is known. In each period a different
agent gets a signal that is a random drawing from this distribution.
The agent then chooses her best guess for the mean of the
distribution (he is minimizing a loss function that is quadratic in
distance from the mean) given her signal and the choices made by
her predecessors. It is quite easy to show that this sequence of
choices converges to the mean for almost every sequence of signals.
Therefore, the result we get contrasts sharply with the result from
this superficially quite similar model.
The key reason why we get a different result is that in our
model the choices made by agents are not always sufficient
statistics for the information they have. If the choices are always
sufficient statistics, future agents always know what information
their predecessors had acted upon, and therefore there is no herd
externality and no inefficiency. It is when the choices made by some
agents affect the information that subsequent decision makers
have that there is a potential for herd externality.
The fact that the choices in our model do not have this
sufficient statistic property clearly has to do with how we specify
the payoffs. It is evident that, for a wide range of signals, the agents
in our model will always choose the same option; this lack of
invertibility is what causes the sufficient property to fail. We
conjecture that typically whenever the space of choices and the
space of signals are of comparable dimension and the payoff
function is continuous, we shall have this kind of invertibility. So,
for example, in the model presented above, we are more likely to
have invertibility if the agents could (and would want to) vary the
size of their investment in different informational settings. On the
other hand, there are many real reasons why it may not be possible
to vary one's choice enough to register all the information one
has-machines, for example, come in only a small number of sizes.
B. Welfare Properties
The welfare question here is motivated by the herd externality. While joining the herd is optimal for the current agent given

<-----Page 14----->810

the play of the game, it reduces the chance that future agents may
discover the truth. So if we consider an ex ante measure of welfare,
imagining that in some primeval state before the game begins all
agents have an equal chance of being at any position in the
sequence of arrivals, we may be able to show that social welfare is
lower in the equilibrium we have described than in other plays of
the game.
This is in fact what we find. Consider another play of the game
in which agents follow the decision rule D* given below.
1. If an agent has a signal, she follows that signal, unless
someone before her has already followed someone else. In that case
she follows suit.
2. If an agent does not have a signal, she picks some option that
has not been picked by anyone else, unless someone before her has
already followed someone else. In that case she follows suit.
This play of the game is set up to ensure that the right choice
always gets revealed as long as there are enough people in the
population. With a very large population it is easy to see that this
would mean that an arbitrarily large fraction of the population will
always make the right choice. Formally, the probability that at
least two people have not received the true signal by the time we get
to the nth person is
1 - (1

- ap)n

1

-

(n - 1)(1 -

z43)n-2o43.

For any e> 0, it is easy to see that we can choose an n(E) large
enough that this probability is at least 1 - e. Now this tells us that
a lower bound for the ex ante expected utility for agents following
this rule is

z[N - n(E)](1-

E)-N,

where N is the size of the population. Notice that by making N
large we can make this arbitrarily close to N(1 - e).
By contrast, the probability that no one will discover the right
choice in the herding equilibrium we described before is
H

[1 -

OL1 -

1)]-1(1

-

&)(1 -

1),

and therefore the ex ante expected utility is bounded above by
zN[1 - H].
Since we can choose e to be as small as we would like to by making

<-----Page 15----->A SIMPLE MODEL OF HERD BEHAVIOR

811

N large, it is easy to see that we can make the above expression
larger than this expression. There is at least one decision rule that
for large enough N does better than the equilibrium we described.
It may be objected here that we have simply described a
strategy and not explained how it will be implemented and the
equilibrium may yet be constrained Pareto optimal. However, this
is not true. This decision rule may be implemented by using a
number of different incentive schemes.17 One way that works is to
punish heavily anybody who is a follower at any option that turns
out to be the incorrect one, while equally rewarding everybody who
chooses the right option. Given these rewards, no one will choose to
be a follower unless they were absolutely sure that the option that
they were choosing was the right one. But this is, of course, exactly
what we want.
Indeed, even if D* cannot be implemented, some of its
advantages can be captured simply by not allowing the first n
agents to observe anybody else's choice when they are making their
own choice. The rest of the population is then allowed to choose
sequentially, with each person observing the choices made by all
her predecessors.
The first n people will, of course, choose to follow their own
signals if they have one and choose at random if they have no
signal. The only way that more than one of these people will choose
the same option is if they are both right. Thus, as long as at least
two of the first n people have chosen the same option, the rest of
the population will realize that this must be the correct option and
choose it.
But an argument exactly paralleling the one given above in the
case of D* can now be used to establish that for a large enough
population, by choosing n suitably, we can make the fraction of the
population who do not choose the correct option arbitrarily small.
In other words, in terms of ex ante welfare, the economy may be
better off if the early decision makers are not allowed to observe the
choices made by the other decision makers than in our original
equilibrium. In other words, destroying information (in this limited sense), can be socially beneficial.18
17. This question is discussed in more detail in an earlier version of this paper
which is available from the author.
18. This is, of course, only in terms of ex ante welfare; in terms of ex post
welfare this is certainly not true.

V. EXTENSIONS AND MODIFICATIONS

A. Alternative Payoff Structures
In the model we analyzed in the last section, everyone who
chooses the right outcome gets the same reward irrespective of how
many others chose this option before and after them. This may be
approximately the correct model of the rewards we get for choosing
the right restaurant, but in many other real world examples the
rewards will depend on the number of people who have chosen this
option and our rank among them. The total amount of the reward
may be fixed, or at least it may not increase as fast as the number of
people who choose the correct option. And in many instances there
are extra rewards for being first or second to choose the correct
option.
To the extent that we have ignored these possibilities, our
analysis may overstate the extent to which there will be herding.
Both of these possibilities suggest that it pays more to choose the
correct option when most others have chosen something else. This
kind of reward for originality clearly discourages herd behavior.
To make this idea precise, consider a model that is identical to
the previous one except that in this case the first person to choose
the right option gets a bigger output than all the others, who are all
assumed to get the same amount. A real world institution where
exactly these rewards are not too implausible is academia; the
emphasis is on being first to do something. If you are not first, the
rank does not matter very much.
A little reflection should persuade the reader that this model is
not really that different from our basic model. It is true that the
relative incentives for being first versus being second are greater
now, which should discourage agents from choosing to be second
but people without signals and people with signals that exactly
match that of someone else, will still be followers. Consequently, it
is possible that the number of people behind someone becomes so
large and the evidence of their numbers so convincing, that
informed agents will decide to ignore their information and the
attraction of the large first prize and join the herd.
Formally, we have Proposition 2.
PROPOSITION2. If the return to the first person choosing the right

option is z1 and the return to everybody else who chooses that
option is Z2, and 0 < Z2 /Z1 < 1, then the unique equilibrium

<-----Page 17----->A SIMPLE MODEL OF HERD BEHAVIOR

813

decision rule19 under Assumptions A, B, and C, is described by
an integer k * > 0 and the following rules.
1. The first decision maker follows her signal if she has one
and chooses i = 0 otherwise.
2. For k > 1, if the kth decision maker has a signal, she will
choose to follow her own signal either if and only if (a) holds or
if (a) does not hold, (b) holds, or if (b) does not hold, (c) holds,
where (a), (b), and (c) are given below.
(a) Her signal matches some option that has already been
chosen.
(b) No option other than i = 0 has been chosen by more than
one person.
(c) The option with the highest i (among those already
chosen) has not been chosen by more than k* people for some
k* > 1, and no other option other than i = 0 has been chosen
by more than one person.
3. Assume that the kth decision maker has a signal. If any
option (among those already chosen) other than the one with
the highest i has been chosen by more than one person, the kth
decision maker will choose this option, unless her signal
matches one of the other options that have already been
chosen. In this case she chooses the latter option.
4. Assume that the kth decision maker has a signal. If the
option with the highest i (among those already chosen) has
been chosen by more than k* people and no other option
(except i = 0) has been chosen by more than one person, she
will choose this option unless her signal matches one of the
options already chosen. In this case she chooses the latter
option.
5. Assume that the kth decision maker does not have a signal.
Then she will choose i = 0 if and only if that is what everyone
else has chosen. Otherwise she chooses the option with the
highest value of i that has already been chosen unless one of
the other options (excluding i = 0) has been chosen by more
than one person. In this case she chooses the latter option.
The proof of this result is omitted since it is a straightforward
extension of arguments used in Section III. In fact, it should be
evident that the result in Section III is a special case of this result
19. Once again we have not actually provided the complete decision rule here;
for this would need to say what happens at all the unreached information sets.
However, this can be done in a straightforward way.

<-----Page 18----->814

for the case where Z2 = zj. What is striking about that special case is
that k*, which we leave as an undetermined integer in this result, is
one in that special case.
What is more, if Z2/Zl is not much smaller than one, it is easy to
see that the value of k* will still be one. As Z2/Zl goes to zero, k* of
course increases, but at least for values of Z2/z1 relatively close to
one, there will be a substantial degree of herding. Therefore, some
of the basic welfare intuitions are going to be quite similar to the
previous case. For N large enough, it will still be true that the
decision rule D* will do better than this rule though the margin of
gain will be less substantial.
While this exercise suggests that the results we got from our
basic model are robust, it also suggests a criticism of our approach.
What we have done is to take an exogenously given payoff structure
and then argue that as long as the payoff structure falls within a
certain class we will get socially inefficient herding. It may be
argued that this is misleading because if the social costs of herding
were large enough, they would automatically bring into place
mechanisms that will modify the payoff structures and reduce
herding. In fact, a message of the first part of this section is that
one can always reduce and even eliminate herding by having very
high rewards for originality. One might then take the presence of
the institution of patent laws (which rewards being first) as proof
that society can always find ways of preventing inefficient herding.
In our opinion, however, this would be going too far. We feel
that in many of the cases we consider there are substantial
informational and transactions costs as well as institutional constraints which prevent the use of the appropriate incentives to
eliminate herding. In some cases, like the restaurant example we
considered in the introduction, it is difficult to think of how one
could put any incentive scheme into place. But even in cases where
there is a mechanism for rewarding originality, as patent protection for example, the degree to which the incentives can be changed
may be quite limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests, for example,
that the amount of protection patents provide varies a lot from case
to case.
If decreasing returns (average payoffs decline as the number of
people who choose it increases) tends to reduce herding, one would
expect increasing returns, which rewards doing what a lot of others
are doing, to increase the tendency to herd. This is indeed what we
find. In an earlier version of this paper (which is available from the
author), we present a detailed analysis of this case which shows

<-----Page 19----->A SIMPLE MODEL OF HERD BEHAVIOR

815

among other things that if the increasing returns are very strong,
the unique equilibrium decision rule chosen by backward programming in the game tree involves everyone choosing the same option.
B. Alternative Information Structures
Another possible criticism of our basic model is that it is based
on rather demanding informational assumptions. We assumed that
each person knows the entire history of choices made by people
before her. This is clearly a strong assumption that may be valid in
some cases (like academic research) but not in others. Examples
where one would like to make a weaker assumption include the
restaurant example suggested in the introduction. In that case we
can usually observe how many people have chosen each restaurant
but not in which order they have made these choices.
However, inspection of the equilibrium decision rules suggests
that in fact they do not make use of any information about the
order of choice so that the same results apply as long as the
distribution of choices is observable. It should be noted, however,
that this is possible only under an assumption like our Assumption
C, which is specified in terms of a location ("choose the highest
among the options already chosen") rather than in terms of some
order information ("follow the last decision maker").
C. Endogenizing the Order of Choice
In this model we have assumed that the order of choice is
exogenously fixed: a more natural assumption (but one which
complicates matters immensely) is to assume that choose when to
move taking into account the fact that waiting is costly. When this
cost is high, we shall have a game that is similar to the one we
analyzed; when it is low, however, a new and interesting set of
possibilities arises. A key question here is whether, if the waiting
costs are low enough, all the agents with signals choose before all
the agents without signals and whether this results in an efficient
outcome. It turns out, somewhat surprisingly perhaps, that it is
possible to have situations with low waiting costs where some of
the uninformed move before some of the informed and the outcome
is inefficient.20 However, the overall analysis is rather complicated,
and we do not yet have very precise ideas about what happens in
the general case.
20. To see the intuition behind this result, note that it is the marginal and not
the absolute value of information that matters in the decision of whether or not to
wait.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We conclude with remarks on deficiencies of our model and
possible directions of research.
The most serious departure of our model from reality is
probably our assumption that signals to the agents are essentially
free; a more realistic analysis would combine the question of
incentives for obtaining these signals with the kinds of considerations we discuss. However, it would seem that dropping this
assumption will encourage people to try to "free ride" on other
people's ideas and this would only exacerbate the herding problem.
In this direction, at least, our results seem robust.
Our assumption that there is a continuum of options and
payoffs exhibit a discontinuity at the true value, is defensible but
somewhat unorthodox. Notice, however, that this assumption
would be quite standard if there were only a large but finite
number of options (then there would no discontinuity, for example). Preliminary investigations show that the results we get for
the case where there are a large but finite number of options are
much more complicated but quite similar. We therefore feel
justified in working with this much more tractable model which we
see as an approximation to the other case.
However, it may still be objected that what is missing from our
model is the fact that options which are in some sense close to the
true option are often better than the other options. By assuming
that all options other than the right one get the same return, we
have not allowed for this possibility. This is clearly an important
direction for future research.
We have implicitly assumed that the agents in this model
cannot actually trade in signals. This may be partly due to the
problem of enforcing contracts describing the exchange of an idea,
and partly due to the presence of transactions costs. Also, if there
are some (perhaps very small) gains to having others choose what
you are choosing, everybody will have the incentive to claim that
they had a signal and that it matched the option they had chosen.
However, since the absence of this kind of trade has serious welfare
consequences, it is probably worthwhile to examine this assumption more closely.
Also, since people gain information by choosing later than
others, there may be strategic aspects of timing that may be worth
investigating. Some current work by the author attempts to extend
this analysis in this direction.

The assumption that there are only two types of decision
makers-those
who have a signal and those who do not-though
quite strong, can be easily relaxed to allow for decision makers with
signals of different quality. As long as there are only a few different
types whose signals differ substantially in quality, the results are
quite similar.
