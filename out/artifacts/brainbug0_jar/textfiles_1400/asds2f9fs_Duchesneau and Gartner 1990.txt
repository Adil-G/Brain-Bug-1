This stua’y examined three types of factors: (I) the characteristics of the
leadentrepreneur, (2) startup processes undertaken during the founding
of the jirm, and (3) firm behaviors after start-up, including management
practices and strategic behaviors, associated with new venture success
and failure. The research involved a field study of 26 small, young Jirms;
13 successful and 13 less, successful (or failed), each engaged in the
distribution offresh juices in eight metropolitan centers (about 30% of the total market) in the United
States.
Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through field work at each firm location.
A statistical analysis of data collected in a structured questionnaire was the primary method for testing
the factors. Case studies of all of the $rms were developed to provide qualitative support for the
quantitative findings of the study. Resultsfrom these analyses indicated significant differences between
successful and unsuccessful firms in all three categories.
Lead entrepreneurs in successful firms were more likely to have been raised by entrepreneurial
parents, have had a broader business and more prior startup experience, and believed they had less
control of their success in business, than unsuccessful entrepreneurs. Successjid entrepreneurs seek
to reduce risk in their businesses. They work long hours, have a personal investment in the firm, and
are good communicators. Successful firms were those initiated with ambitious goals. Lead entrepreneurs had a clear broad business idea which provided the adaptive torque required to overcome
adversity, confrontation, ana’ often, a troubledJinancia1 condition.
Effective startup or purchase required broad planning efforts that considered all aspects of the

industry and jrm. Successful firms spent more time planning (237 hours) than unsuccessful firms (85
hours). The use of outside professionals and advisors for help in solving spectfic problems during
startup was important for success as well as the advice and information provided by other industry
participants, particularly customers and suppliers. Most ventures did not have written business plans.
Nearly all purchased firms failed. Buyers of competitively troubled @ns were negatively displaced, generally unemployed managers who lacked broad management experience, and while often
well educated, had no prior experience in purchasing a business.
Successfulfirmswere found to be moreflexible, participative, and adaptive organizations. These
firms had employees who could per$orm the work duties of others and were likely to be managed in
a way that provided these workers with the flexibilityto modify their jobs to adapt to changing industry
and organizational conditions. Lead entrepreneurs of successful firms were likely to spend more time
communicating with partners, customers, suppliers, and employees than the lead entrepreneurs of
unsuccessful firms.
Successful firms sought to become larger firms and embarked upon sales to broad sectors of
the market. Successful firms achieved high market shares; with market shares came higher financial
returns. Less successfilJirms were restricted to narrow market sectors consisting of smaller customers
and those more dificult to service. While customer service remained an important concern, the
commodity nature of fresh juices failed to support differentiation, and the narrowly focused firm was
typified by high product costs and unprojitable operations.

INTRODUCTION
Why do some new ventures succeed while other new ventures fail?
This study suggests that new venture success is not solely influenced by a single type
of factor, such as management, strategy, or industrial context. Instead, many factors influence
new venture creation and performance in a complex web, in other words a “gestalt” (Gartner
1985; Miller and Friesen 1984), of interrelationships.
We study three types of factors-(l)
the characteristics of the lead entrepreneur,
(2) start-up processes undertaken during the
founding of the firm, and (3) firm behaviors after start-up involving organizational
and
industry practices--for
the purposes of generating a profile of the many different variables
which might be useful for differentiating between successful and unsuccessful young firms.
This research stems from a study by Van de Ven et al. (1984), who examined 12 educational
software companies (six low-performing
and six high-performing)
from three different approaches: entrepreneurial (background and characteristics of the founder of the new venture),
organizational (processes by which the new venture is planned and structured), and ecological
(environmental
factors such as the political, economic, and structural conditions). While the
software firms were provided with varying levels of support by a corporate sponsor, the
Fresh Juice Distributors (FJDs) were involved in a more hostile and turbulent environment
characterized by severe price competition. Our study is an expansion and modification of
Van de Ven et al. (1984), which takes into account other studies that recognize the influence
of a combination of many different factors affecting new venture performance (Buzzell and
Gale 1987; Cooper 1970; Gartner 1985; Gartner et al. 1989; Sandberg 1986; Sandberg and
Hofer 1987; Timmons et al. 1985; Vesper 1990).
This section will offer a brief overview of ideas on the factors that we believe influence
new venture success. Subsequent sections of the paper describe the FJD industry, the sample
of firms studied, the methodology employed for learning about firm success and failure, and
a discussion of the significant findings generated from the research.
Since a number of thorough and thoughtful reviews of the entmpreneurship
literature
exist which comprehensively
survey factors influencing the creation and success of new
ventures (Bird 1989; Brockhaus 1982; Brockhaus and Horwitz 1986; Gartner 1989; Sandberg

<-----Page 2----->NEWVENTURESUCCESSANDFAILURE 299
1986; Vesper 1990; Wortman 1987), we limit our discussion of previous research (Table 1)
to a limited selection of particular entrepreneurial characteristics that comprise the new
venture success and failure profile (Tables 2 and 4). These variables were selected from a
detailed and comprehensive discussion of research on factors that influence new venture
creation and success found in Duchesneau (1987).

The Lead Entrepreneur
We posit that successful entrepreneurs are likely to: (1) have entrepreneurial parents, (2)
obtain a broad range of managerial experiences, (3) seek to reduce risk, and (4) see firm
success as within the sphere of their control.

start-up

Behaviors

Entrepreneurs that start successful new ventures are likely to: (5 and 6) identify a business
idea that is clear and broad, (7) use a procedural and comprehensive planning process, (8)
spend more time planning, (9) generate a broad plan which recognizes all of the functional
areas, (10) undertake market research, (11) seek professional advice, and (12) purchase
fillllS.

Firms Behaviors and Strategy
Successful new ventures are likely to have: (13) employees with diversified skills and abilities,
(14) lead entrepreneurs who are solely in command, (15) utilized joint ventures, (16 and
17) lead entrepreneurs who encourage participative decision making at strategic and operational levels, (18) emphasis on high levels of communication, (19) started at higher levels
of capitalization, and (20) strategies of aggressive entry to broad markets.

THE INDUSTRY AND SAMPLE
During the late 197Os, with the rising demand for fresh and natural foods, many new firms
emerged as fresh juice distributors (FJDs) to process and distribute (or just distribute) freshsqueezed (raw) juices. This industry has many of the characteristics of Porter’s “emerging
industry” type: technological and strategic uncertainty; poor and inadequate information
about competitors and marketplace opportunities; high, but rapidly falling, product costs
and selling prices; barriers in obtaining raw materials, capital, etc. (Porter 1980, pp. 221225). In the FJD industry, barriers to market entry are low, and the product provided, freshsqueezed juices, is perceived as a commodity. A FJD has little ability to command high
prices through differentiation. In addition, fresh squeezed juices are themselves substitute
products for long-established products such as juices from concentrate or fresh fruit squeezed
on premises by the customer. In each market a relatively small number of institutional
customers (primarily hotels or restaurants) consume an important, sometimes dominant,
share of the total market. These customers consciously encouraged new firms to enter the
industry to drive prices lower. The continual availability of high-quality products is a requirement for marketplace success. Access to citrus fruit can be a major problem because
of unpredictable winter freezes in citrus-producing areas. By 1988, with industry growth
rates of over 50% annually, over 90 firms had entered the industry, and a shakeout of

marginal firms became apparent. Total 1988 sales in the United States were estimated to be
over $150 million.
The sample of 26 firms selected for this study consisted of 13 successful and 13
unsuccessful (or failed) firms, located in eight metropolitan centers with populations in
excess of one million (each city was designated as a separate market) in the Southeast,
Central, Southwest, and Pacific regions of the United States. Each of the 26 firms selected
for this research was primarily in the business of distributing fresh orange juice to hotels,
restaurants, and supermarkets. A FJD was defined as a person or firm that processes and
distributes, or only distributes, fresh-squeezed (raw) juices as its primary or dominant line
of business. The 13 successful firms were classified based on their financial returns for the
12 months preceeding the interview: three firms provided pretax profits and owners’ salaries
combined of over $35,000 annually but less than a 10% return on the firm’s net worth; 10
firms had pre-tax profits and owners’ salaries combined of over $35,000 annually and a
return of more than 25% on the firm’s net worth. Of the 13 unsuccessful firms, nine had
discontinued operations, or were operated under court order or by creditors; and four had
provided profits and owners salaries combined of less than $35,000 preceding the interview.
Failed firms (those discontinuing operations) were included, provided that these firms were
active on or since January 1, 1983. No firms older than seven years were encountered in
the research effort. The study sample encompassed about 30% of the national population of
FJDs and was choosen to represent a broad range of emerging FJD markets and new FJD
ventures. Of the 26 firms studied: 7 were purchased and 19 were startups, 13 were early
entrants and 13 were late entrants. Successful firms tended to be older (average age, 49
months) than less successful firms (average age, 32 months). The successful firms had
average sales of $1,800,000 and nine employees, versus the less-successful or unsuccessful
firms with average sales of $500,000 and four employees. The largest firm in the sample
had annual sales in excess of $6,000,000, while the smallest firm had less than $200,000
in sales. While larger firm size was clearly identified with firm success, the attainment of
such size and success was the concern of this study.

METHODOLOGY
Information on each of the 26 firms was collected during a four- to eight-hour visit at the
respondent’s place of business (or at an agreed-to meeting place for entrepreneurs of failed
firms). Interviews with both successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurs were conducted from
December, 1986 through June, 1987. During this visit the lead entrepreneur was interviewed,
and for those entrepreneurs still in business, a tour of the firm’s facilities was conducted.
In addition to the visits, the lead author’s role as an industry participant and founder of
several FJDs provided unique access to other industry resources, such as information from
partners, employees and managers, competitors, customers, and shipping sources. Two types
of data were generated. A 15-page (116 question) questionnaire was filled out which provided
quantitative information for analysis. This questionnaire was constructed from measures
taken from research instruments used previously by Van de Van et al. (1984), for questions
dealing with entrepreneurial characteristics and the process undertaken to start the firm, and
by the Strategic Planning Institute’s STR database of corporate ventures (Strategic Planning
Institute 1978) and Miller and Dess’s typology of competitive strategies (Miller and Dess
1985), for questions on the industry and the firm’s strategic behaviors. In addition, a fourto eight-page case on each firm was written describing the firm’s history as well as qualitative
impressions about the lead entrepreneur, the process undertaken to start the firm, and the

<-----Page 5----->302

AND W.B. GARTNER

strategic behaviors. The case narratives and questionnaire are described in Duchesneau
(1987).
The two groups of firms (successful versus unsuccessful or failed) were compared
using methods of analysis similar to methods employed by Van de Ven et al (1984), that
is, univariate analysis of variation and correlations were generated to obtain insights into
relationships among the different variables. Conclusions drawn from the results were based
on both the statistical results from the questionnaire and the qualitative information provided
in the cases and field research.
firm’s

FINDINGS
Results from the univariate analysis of variation across the three dimensions of measures
(lead entrepreneur, start-up processes, and firm behaviors) revealed significant differences
between the two groups of firms. Table 2 provides a summary of some of the measures that
were found to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful new firms in the sample
studied. Table 3 shows correlations between these measures. A complete description of all
of the significant and nonsignificant quantitative findings can be found in Duchesneau (1987).

DISCUSSION
Table 4 summarizes some of the findings of the research in terms of successful and unsuccessful new venture practice. The discussion that follows focuses on this profile. This
discussion is based on both the quantitative analysis and insights from the case studies.

The Lead Entrepreneur
Comparisons of successful and unsuccessful lead entrepreneurs revealed that successful lead
entrepreneurs came from entrepreneurial families, and attained higher levels of: education,
prior start-up and managerial experience, broad business skills, strong communication skills
and propensities, self-confidence and reliance, resourcefulness, and caution, than the lead
entrepreneurs of unsuccessful firms. These findings corroborate most of the results found in
Van de Ven et al. (1984) as well as other studies that have evaluated entrepreneurial
characteristics (Brockhaus 1982; Brockhaus and Horwitz 1986; Sandberg 1986).
Some researchers (Mescon and Montanari 1981; Timmons et al. 1985) have considered

<-----Page 9----->306

D.A. DUCIESNEAU AND W.B. G_ARTNER

the value of family role models as an influence on new venture success. Based on both the
quantitative and qualitative findings, we concur that previous family business experience
appears to provide entrepreneurs with more realistic expectations from self-employment and
the kinds of attitudes and behaviors necessary for surmounting the crises of entrepreneurship.
We suggest that the findings that prior start-up experience, managerial experience,
higher education, and broad business skills were correlated to new venture success may
indicate that these successful entrepreneurs have “street smarts”-an ability to learn from
their mistakes. Entrepreneurial management in an emerging industry requires the application
of knowledge learned in past situations to new but vaguely familiar problems. “Street smarts”
comes from years of organizational situations--decision vignettes providing valuable patterns
of problem recognition--which create a storehouse of personally integrated know-how to
identify and solve new problems. Herbert Simon calls these patterns of recognition “chunks”
and indicates that a large number of chunks are a requirement for expertness in a given field
(Simon 1987). Without a large repertoire of chunks from prior education and experience,
the lead entrepreneur is unlikely to muddle successfully through these problem situations.
Inexperienced managers, those without prior start-up experience and broad business skills,
resorted to a narrow range of behaviors learned from their prior experiences in mature and
inflexible organizations. Such rigidity was tolerated in single-firm early markets, but punished
under conditions of late market competition.
start-up

Behaviors

In successful firms, lead entrepreneurs had a clear broad business idea that provided organizational will to overcome adversity, confrontation, and often a troubled financial condition.
A narrow or vague commitment from the entrepreneur(s) failed to provide the FJD with the
adaptive torque required for survival. Successful firms were those initiated with ambitious
goals-a case of “what you dream is what you get.”
Among the procedures important to successful start-up are planning processes. Firms
that used a planning process similar to the process outlined by Van de Ven et al. (1984) as
the PPM Model (problem exploration, knowledge exploration, business plan development,
and start-up on a small and incremental basis) were found to be more successful than those
firms which followed a less comprehensive planning process. In this study, successful firms
spent more time planning (237 hours) than unsuccessful firms (85 hours). Market and
competitive research were required to identify opportunities and reduce marketplace risks,
though the absolute level of market research was low for both groups of firms (successful
firms undertook small efforts in market research, whereas unsuccessful firms undertook little
or no market research). The use of outside professionals and advisors for help in solving
specific problems during start-up was important for success. Successful new ventures also
depended on the advice and information provided by other industry participants, particularly
customers and suppliers. Successful entrepreneurs sought out information, that is, they were
veridically aware (Webster 1976, 1977)-open to any information (good or bad) which could
be used to help them improve their ventures’ performance. Unsuccessful entrepreneurs were
not truth seekers. They were personally rigid and less willing to recognize problems or
accept advice from others.
Effective start-up or purchase required broad planning efforts that considered all aspects
of the industry and firm. Most ventures (successful and unsuccessful) did not have written
business plans. Successful entrepreneurs appeared to utilize personal planning notes, a written

<-----Page 10----->NEW VENTURE SUCCESS AND FAILURE

307

analysis of critical success factors used for personal decision making when evaluating a
specific area of the business.
Purchased firms were predictive of the buyers’ subsequent failure. Buyers invariably
purchased competitively troubled firms. Buyers were often negatively displaced, unemployed
managers. Buyers failed to realize the great financial risks of self employment. Buyers lacked
broad management experience and, although often well educated, had no prior experience
in purchasing a business. Sellers took purposive advantage of the buyer’s inevitable lack of
industry and competitive information. Buyers relied upon historical and financial information
that had little predictive value in the face of new and strong competition. Inadequate market
and competitive research was undertaken. The one buyer that used outside professionals in
the purchase of his firm was the only purchased firm that was successful.

Firm Behaviors and Strategy
Successful firms were found to be more flexible, participative, and adaptive organizations.
We were initially surprised to find that successful firms have more specialized employees
than less successful firms. We had assumed that successful firms would be more “organic,”
that is, have fewer specialized employees, in order to adapt to changing environmental
conditions. It seems that because successful firms were larger than unsuccessful firms (both
in sales and in number of employees), successful firms were more likely to have reached a
size that required individuals who had specialized skills. Lead entrepreneurs of successful
firms were likely to spend more time communicating
with partners, customers, suppliers,
and employees than the lead entrepreneurs of unsuccessful firms.
Joint ventures appeared to be the organizational
format most adaptive to changes in
the industry. Partnerships, joint ventures, and shareholder agreements represented complex
and sophisticated forms of firm ownership and participation in which resources (capital,
access to raw materials and channels of distribution) could be rapidly acquired and exploited.
Successful firms that employed such methods were comprised of individuals with greater
business and start-up experience. Their industry experience and contacts enabled them to
construct beneficial strategic alliances. The sole proprietorship or single shareholder firm
was usually unsuccessful, in part because of the failure of purchased firms (which were all
sole proprietorships).
Sole proprietorships
were managed by individuals who were less
communicative
and more guarded, less likely to take advice from professionals or others,
and likely to rely upon strong personal control rather than participative decision-making
processes. Sole proprietorships were likely to be outsiders, individuals who lacked a thorough
knowledge of changes in the marketplace that could only be gained through a network of
relationships with other industry participants.
Higher levels of initial capital were clearly associated with firm success, with the mean
investment of $123,000 for successful new ventures versus $54,000 for unsuccessful firms.
The higher-capitalized
ventures were younger firms that had entered when the industry
became more complex and capital intensive. In early markets, lower capital requirements
were associated with success (Drucker 1985; Goldstein 1984, Thome and Ball 1981). Later
markets had high capital requirements to attain lowest product costs through investments in
plant and equipment to achieve economies of scale. Marketplace survival in late markets
often required “investment”
in the form of sustained, unprofitable operations caused by
unrealistic price competition-“price
wars .” Smaller firms and sole proprietorships
were
often unable or unwilling to sustain these losses and were closed or sold.

Because firms in the FJD industry sell commodities, that is, because all companies
must compete by selling a high-quality fresh-squeezed juice, it was suggested that low-cost
producers would be the most likely to survive price competition from rivals and other entrants.
The ability to be a low-cost producer would involve selling the most product to the largest
customers as well as to the largest number of customers. Companies restricted to high-cost
positions or narrow focus were squeezed out of the marketplace.
Successful firms sought to become larger firms and embarked upon sales to broad
sectors of the market. Successful firms achieved high market share; with market share came
higher financial returns. Less successful firms were restricted to narrow market sectors
consisting of smaller customers and those more difficult to service. While customer service
remained an important concern, the commodity nature of fresh juices failed to support product
differentiation,
and the narrowly focused firm was typified by highest product costs and
unprofitable operations. The nature of the marketplace pushes firms toward the low cost/broad
focus strategy as a means of survival. Firms that were unable to achieve the low cost/broad
focus strategy were faced with mediocre performance, exited by selling out, or failed.
Overall, these findings offer additional evidence that an aggressive entry strategy, that
is, a strategy in which a firm enters an industry with a clear and broad vision that includes
high market share objectives and profitability, a broad market focus and a correspondingly
high capital investment for achieving its goals, generates higher market shares and profitability than less aggressive firms (Biggadike 1979; Hobson and Morrison 1983; MacMillan
and Day 1987; Miller and Camp 1985).

LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH
The use of an in-depth case study methodology has benefits and disadvantages which influence
the research results offered, yet the use of multiple measures and approaches (case studies,
interviews, written histories, a quantitative questionnaire,
the use of a panel of industry
experts, and the collection of company records) may have minimized the introduction of
error into the results generated. Univariate analysis of variance as a statistical method may
not have captured some relationships among the variables, though a complete correlation
matrix of all of the variables was generated and analyzed.
It should be emphasized that causality can not be inferred from the analysis of the
quantitative data. We believe that the value of this field research does not depend solely on
the quantitative measures, but rather on the broad qualitative inquiry used to understand the
creation of successful organizations. It should also be noted that the inclusion of failed firms
in the analysis was essential for identifying the practices and strategies of successful firms.
In-depth field research which recognizes the complex nature of the new venture process
is likely to be fertile ground for the generation of useful theory and practice on the development of successful new ventures. We believe a very fruitful area for field research on
new ventures will be to explore the nature and process of aggressive entry. Results in this
study indicated that founders with prior entrepreneurial and managerial experience are more
likely to think and act in ways which can build an organization with sufficient size and scope
for aggressive entry. These prior experiences of aggressive entrepreneurs seem to be stepping
stones which lead to the “big vision”-starting
an organization with sufficient size and scope.
Longitudinal field work, oral histories, and other historical methods would be useful for
tracing how aggressive entrepreneurs acquire the chunks of knowledge necessary to imagine
an ambitious new venture. In addition, in-depth field research would be useful for describing
the complex process which entrepreneurs undertake to develop aggressive new ventures:

<-----Page 12----->NEW VENTURE SUCCESS AND FAILURE

gathering the resources, forming a team and organization,
and establishing a network of
contacts, customers, advisors, and suppliers. Since many of the findings presented here both
support and conflict with previous research on entrepreneurial
characteristics,
start-up behaviors, and firm characteristics and strategies, additional research should be undertaken to
study new ventures in other emerging industries. As additional studies are undertaken, a
more comprehensive
model of the new venture process will emerge which may be able to
identify the various contingencies that influence new venture success in specific industries.

CONCLUSIONS
A framework that outlined three types of factors: (1) the characteristics of the lead entrepreneur, (2) start-up processes undertaken during the founding of the firm, and (3) firm
behaviors after start-up, including management practices and strategic behaviors, was used
to generate a profile of variables associated with new venture success and failure.
Lead entrepreneurs in successful firms were more likely to have: broad business and
prior startup experience, entrepreneurial
parents, a high but moderated self-reliance,
risk
reducing behaviors, worked long hours, extensive communication
efforts and ability, and a
personal investment in the firm.
In successful firms, lead entrepreneurs had a clear, broad business idea that provided
organizational
will to overcome adversity, confrontation,
and often a troubled financial
condition. A narrow or vague commitment from the entrepreneur(s)
failed to provide the
adaptive torque required for survival. Successful firms were those initiated with ambitious
goals.
Successful firms spent more time planning (237 hours) than unsuccessful firms (85
hours). The use of outside professionals and advisors for help in solving specific problems
during start-up was important for success. Successful new ventures also depended on the
advice and information provided by other industry participants, particularly customers and
suppliers.
Effective start-up or purchase required broad planning efforts that considered all aspects
of industry and firm. Such planning would likely be beneficial if developed into a written
plan, but this research indicated that most ventures (successful and unsuccessful) did not
have written business plans. Successful entrepreneurs appeared to utilize personal planning
notes, a written analysis of critical success factors that entrepreneurs used for their own
personal decision making.
Purchased firms were predictive of the buyers’ subsequent failure. Buyers of competitively troubled firms were negatively displaced, generally unemployed managers. Buyers
failed to realize the great financial risks of self employment. Buyers lacked broad management
experience, and while often well educated, had no prior experience in purchasing a business.
Successful firms were found to be more flexible, participative, and adaptive organizations. Yet these firms were more likely to employ personnel with more specialized skills
and abilities. Lead entrepreneurs of successful firms were likely to spend more time communicating with partners, customers, suppliers, and employees than the lead entrepreneurs
of unsuccessful firms.
Higher levels of initial capital were clearly associated with firm success-with
a mean
investment of $123,000 for successful new ventures versus $54,000 for unsuccessful firms.
The higher-capitalized
ventures were younger firms that had entered when the industry
became more complex and capital intensive. In early markets, lower capital requirements

<-----Page 13----->310

were associated with success. Later markets had high capital requirements to attain lowest
product costs through investments in plant and equipment to achieve economies of scale.
Successful firms sought to become larger firms and embarked upon sales to broad
sectors of the market. Successful firms achieved high market share; with market share came
higher financial returns. Less successful firms were restricted to narrow market sectors
consisting of smaller customers and those more difficult to service. While customer service
remained an important concern, the commodity nature of fresh juices failed to support such
differentiation,
and the narrowly focused firm was typified by highest product costs and
unprofitable operations.
This profile was generated to broadly distinguish between successful and unsuccessful
new ventures. It is not our intention to suggest that all entrepreneurs must fit the “success”
profile in order to build a successful business. As in any study involving the generation of
results from comparing aggregations of “successes” to “failures,” no clear-cut prescriptions
can be offered that are guaranteed to work in every particular situation. As the results
showed, no perfect correlations existed indicating that a particular factor was always related
to new venture success. From our perspective, it appears to be part of the irony of entrepreneurship that successful new ventures often owe their survival to “luck’-some
particular
set of circumstances that could never be planned for, or counted on. This profile is, therefore,
not a formula for success, but it does present characteristics that may identify critical startup priorities for improving an entrepreneur’s new venture success chances.
