Management innovation is an important driver of economic progress and a central part
of managerial agendas. Yet our understanding of this phenomenon is limited. We
propose a model in which management innovation is created in the presence of sets of
organisational problems, sets of possible solutions, and decision-makers bringing them
together, following the classical garbage can model. We test and find support for this
model for a large sample of UK firms. We also show that there are trade-offs among
solutions and decision-makers and that management innovation has a positive impact
on the future productivity growth of firms.

<-----Page 2----->THE ANTECEDENTS AND PERFORMANCE CONSEQUENCES OF MANAGEMENT
INNOVATION

Management innovation is a very important part of the agenda of practising managers. It
has brought us Quality of Work Life, Business Process Reengineering, Activity Based
Costing, Enterprise Resource Planning, Six Sigma, and Operations Research among
many others. It has greatly increased the fame of such people as Henry Ford, Alfred
Sloan, and Jack Welch but also brought us ‘villains’ like Frederick Taylor. We hold it
partly responsible for some of the biggest success stories in business, including the rise
of Toyota and GE, and believe it has affected the lives of millions of workers around the
globe. Management innovation is undoubtedly a key contributor to economic growth and
prosperity (Schumpeter, 1947; Teece, 1980). Thus any academic knowledge created in
this area is of value for practitioners, and studies of management innovation ought to be
plentiful.
Yet academics have commented that “most studies address only one category of
innovation, i.e. technical innovations. All too often, studies neglect administrative
innovations, which are equally essential to the growth and effective operation of an
organization” (Damanpour and Evan, 1984: 392). And more recently it has been
suggested that ”it still appears as if there is little systematic knowledge available about
the determinants of the diffusion of organizational innovations and, indeed, about their
effects” (Alänge, Jacobson, & Jarnehammar, 1998: 3).
Undoubtedly progress has been made in recent years through the investigation of
the diffusion patterns of specific management innovations like Quality Circles
(Abrahamson, 1996), ISO 9000 (Guler, Guillen, & MacPherson, 2002), and Total Quality
=

<-----Page 3----->Management (Zbaracki, 1998), often through the lens of management fashion
(Abrahamson, 1996; Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999). But although this literature is
insightful, particularly with regard to how specific management innovations diffuse
across populations of firms, two important questions have thus far not been addressed
satisfactorily. First, under what conditions do individual firms decide to create and
implement management innovation? This question calls for an investigation of
organisation, industry and country level indicators that can help explain the occurrence
of management innovation in organisations. Second, what performance consequences
do of these innovations produce? If firms decide to create and implement a
management innovation, does that actually help them improve their performance? Or is
management innovation undertaken for other reasons, perhaps in order to build
legitimacy and status?
The current paper addresses these two questions. We focus first on the firm-level
factors associated with the implementation of management innovations. We build on
the behavioural theory of the firm, and in particular on the related notions of problemistic
search (Cyert & March, 1963) and “garbage can” decision-making (Cohen, March, &
Olsen, 1972). More specifically, we suggest that management innovation occurs in the
presence of three sets of factors: specific problems facing the firm, possible solutions
provided by a variety of internal and external sources, and decision-makers who are
motivated and capable of bringing these problems and solutions together. Furthermore,
we expect decision-makers to pursue a problemistic search process that is both simpleminded (i.e. proceeds on the basis of a simple model of causality unless driven to a
more complex one) and biased (i.e. steered by the prior experiences and goals of the
managers driving it)(Cyert & March, 1963: 121).
=

<-----Page 4----->The second part of the study focuses on the consequences of management
innovation, and in particular its effect on a firm’s future productivity growth. We suggest,
in fact, that productivity growth is driven more by management innovation than by
product and process innovation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First we discuss the definition of
management innovation and we build a set of hypotheses around its antecedents and
performance consequences. Next we present the empirical analysis, based on over
3,600 establishment level responses to the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS 3)
which are linked to the Office for National Statistics’ Annual Respondents Database
(ARD) for investigation of performance effects. We then present our findings which
provide strong support for our hypotheses our model. In the final section we discuss the
findings and possible directions for future research.

MANAGEMENT INNOVATION

We define management innovation as the invention and implementation of a new
management practice, process or structure that represents a significant and novel
departure from generally accepted or standard management practices, and is intended
to further organizational goals (Alänge et al., 1998; Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981; Teece,
1980). This definition has four important elements: management innovation requires
both invention and implementation (rather than one or the other); it has to be perceived
as new to the adopting organization (rather than the adoption of a proven innovation
from elsewhere); it can involve changes to internal practices, processes, or structures
=

<-----Page 5----->(or some combination of the three); and it should intend to deliver benefits to the
organisation (e.g. performance improvements, greater innovative capacity, or greater
legitimacy, Staw & Epstein, 2000)1.
Management innovation has received sporadic research attention over the last
thirty years. Most work has focused on the diffusion of specific management innovations
across firms, industries and countries (e.g. Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Burns &
Wholey, 1993; Fligstein, 1985; Kogut & Parkinson, 1993; Zbaracki, 1998). A second line
of interest has been to examine the conditions under which management innovation
transpires. Some studies have focused on the emergence of specific management
innovations (Abrahamson, 1997; Chandler, 1962; Pezet, 1997), while others have taken
a more comparative perspective (Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981; McCabe, 2000; Stjernberg
& Philips, 1993; Tichy & Sandstrom, 1974).

Finally, there has been considerable

interest in the relationship between management innovation and technological
innovation. One strand of this work has looked at the interdependencies between
management and technological innovation, showing that they are often synchronous
with one another (Kimberly & Evanisko, 1981; Damanpour & Evan, 1984; Georgantzas
& Shapiro, 1993; Boer & During, 2001). A second strand has focused more on the
conceptual differences between the two, and it has emphasized that management
innovations are typically more intangible, less easy to protect, more prone to internal
resistance, and more subject to interpretation than technological innovations (Benders &
van Veen, 2001; Alänge et al., 1998; Teece, 1980).
=================================================
1
We prefer the term management innovation to administrative innovation (Damanpour & Evan, 1984; Ettlie, 1988)
which is typically used more narrowly to describe new organisational structures and human resources systems.
Furthermore, some of the empirical work on administrative innovation (Damanpour & Evan, 1984; Ettlie, 1988) is
concerned with rather minor procedures that lack the kind of significant impact management innovation can have.

=

<-----Page 6----->While these studies have proved useful to our understanding of management
innovation, many important issues remain. One open research question is the conditions
under which firms create and implement management innovations. Most prior studies
have focused on the innovation itself, but by taking a firm-level perspective in this study
we are able to shed new light on the facilitating conditions that allow management
innovations to transpire. In the words of Anderson and Young (2001: 2) “few systematic
attempts have been made to understand how management innovations aimed at
improving knowledge creation and management are adopted and implemented by
organizations”.
A second research question, which will interest strategic management scholars in
particular, is whether management innovation allows firms to capture additional rents
and if they do to whom these rents accrue (first movers or later imitators). While there
has been some work looking at whether firms’ statements about specific management
techniques increase their performance (e.g. Staw & Epstein, 2000), it has not directly
addressed the consequences of the implementation of management innovation. As
recent empirical work demonstrates (Fiss & Zajac, 2005) there may well be gaps
between rhetoric and reality when it comes to implementations of management
innovation. In this paper we will empirically address both these questions.

THEORY AND HYPOTHESES

===========================================================================================================================================================
Finally, the term administrative innovation has more or less disappeared from management practice, while the term
management innovation is increasingly used by practitioners (Feigenbaum & Feigenbaum, 2005).

=

<-----Page 7----->We use the behavioural theory of the firm to frame our understanding of the conditions
under which management innovation emerges. This theory builds on the early work of
Herbert Simon and James March (March & Simon, 1958; Simon, 1947) and was formally
introduced by Cyert and March (1963). Its principles are now well known: managers are
assumed to make boundedly rational (rather than fully rational) decisions due to their
cognitive limitations, and they “satisfice” (i.e. they seek out acceptable rather than
optimal solutions to their problems). In a further extension of these ideas, Cohen, March
and Olsen (1972: 2) put forward the notion of the organization as a garbage can – as “a
collection of choices looking for problems, issues and feelings looking for decision
situations in which they might be aired, solutions looking for issues to which they might
be the answer, and decision makers looking for work”. The suggestion, in this model, is
that decision-making rarely follows a rational, sequential process. Sometimes the
starting point is a clearly defined problem, but in other situations it might be a new idea
or solution that is looking for a problem to solve, or it might even be an individual
seeking to make changes.
We suggest that the behavioural theory of the firm provides a useful framing for a
study of management innovation for two main reasons. First, management innovations
are inherently more intangible in nature and less easy to evaluate than technological
innovations (Alänge et al., 1998; Teece, 1980), which makes it likely that the process of
implementing them will be subject to the cognitive limitations and biases that are central
to the behavioural theory of the firm Second, prior literature has suggested that
management innovations can be inspired both by specific problems faced by a firm (e.g.
Chandler, 1962) as well as by the existence of possible solutions (Abrahamson, 1996). It
also highlights the role of key individuals in driving the process of innovation (e.g.
=

<-----Page 8----->Kimberly, 1981). The coexistence of problems, solutions, and decision-makers makes a
garbage-can framing appropriate.
We will now elaborate in more detail on the problems, solutions, and decision
makers that together give rise to management innovation (see Figure 1). We focus on
two sets of problems - factors inhibiting the firm’s ability to innovate, and sudden
changes in the growth or decline of the firm. Solutions are operationalized in terms of
the different sources of new ideas from inside and outside the boundaries of the firm and
from domestic and international contexts. And to assess the quality of decision-makers
we focus on the level of skills and training of managers in the firm. To the extent that
each of these elements is present in the firm, the level of management innovation is
predicted to increase. However, we also argue that there are limits to the value of new
ideas from different sources, and if the search for new ideas is taken too far it can
restrict the level of management innovation in the firm.

Problems

From our reading of the literature on management innovation, we suggest that problems
can occur at two levels of analysis. The first is changes in competitive conditions at the
level of the firm as a whole that cause managers to re-evaluate fundamental aspects of
their internal operations. The second is the existence of obstacles at the level of a
specific activity that prevent managers from delivering on their goals. Consider the firm
level of analysis first, and in particular the possibility of abrupt changes in size or scope
caused by acquisitions, divestments, or shifts in organic growth.

=

<-----Page 9----->Rapid growth can be an important stimulus for management innovation. Firms
typically grow through a process of punctuated equilibrium (Tushman and Anderson,
1986) and during the periods of upheaval as they shift from one structure to another
some level of management innovation is often required. As one example, GM
established the M-form organisation as a response to the organizational complexity
created through a series of acquisitions (Chandler, 1962). Equally, declining sales or
divestments can cause upheaval in the internal workings of the firm and can sometimes
lead to management innovation.

Management innovation has been linked to the

presence of slack resources typical of times during which demand falls sharply (Nickell,
Nicolitsas, & Patterson, 2001). And a specific example of rapid decline leading to
management innovation is the response by US manufacturing firms such as General
Motors and John Deere in the early 1980s to the ‘Japanese challenge’. During this
period of time they invented and implemented such innovations as activity based
costing, flexible manufacturing systems, and concurrent engineering (Cooper & Kaplan,
1988; Ettlie, 1988).
The role of growth and decline as stimuli for management innovation has also
been observed at a broader level. When there is a rapid change in an organisation’s
environment or inside an organisation, the need arises to come up with radical new
solutions in an effort to combat uncertainty (Weitz & Shenhav, 2000). Abrahamson
(1997) showed that the speed of diffusion of management innovations is particularly
high near peaks and troughs in long-term Kondratieff waves (i.e. during periods of
economic upheaval). Kossek (1987) suggested that the implementation of management
innovations in the Human Resource area follow a similar pattern shaped by industry
growth levels. Taken together, these points suggest the following hypothesis:
=

<-----Page 10----->Hypothesis 1. The higher the level of organizational change in the firm (measured in the
form of rapid growth or decline in sales), the higher the level of management innovation.

The second set of problems we consider are obstacles at the level of a specific
management activity, namely innovation2. Firms have long realised that innovation can
help them improve their success in the marketplace (Baumol, 2002), and most have
invested considerably in building structures and processes to support their innovation
activities. However, there is a high level of uncertainty associated with innovation, and it
typically requires very different ways of working than the more predictable and routinized
parts of the firm (Burns & Stalker, 1961; Spender & Kessler, 1995). As a result, there are
many well-known obstacles to innovation, including risk-aversion, lack of knowledgesharing, and a tendency for new ideas to be driven out by old ideas (March, 1991).
Management innovation is one plausible way of overcoming the obstacles that
hinder innovation, and indeed there is considerable evidence that this happens. For
example, Ettlie (1988) dubbed the simultaneous use of management innovation and
technological innovation ‘synchronous innovation’, and he described in detail how the
use of appropriate forms of management innovation made technological innovation
more effective in manufacturing firms in the United States in the 1980s. There are also
various examples of management innovations that arose primarily to improve a firm’s
ability to innovate. Commercial research laboratories were created in the 1890s by
=================================================

The reason to take this activity-level perspective is that the activity is the place where problems and solutions meet.
For example, the observation “this firm is too bureaucratic” is an empty statement, whereas the observation “this
firm is too bureaucratic to develop a competitive product” could potentially stimulate an attempt to reduce its level of
bureaucracy.

=

<-----Page 11----->Germany’s Bayer and some 10 years later by General Electric as a means of
systematizing what had up to that point been a rather ad hoc process. In the early 1940s
Lockheed created the first “skunkworks” specifically because important innovations
required as part of constructing jet fighters needed in the war effort could not be
achieved inside existing structures. The R&D stage-gate system and the corporate
venture unit were also innovative management solutions to perceived deficiencies in the
innovation process. In sum, we expect the presence of factors inhibiting technology and
product innovation to act as important stimuli for the occurrence of management
innovation.

Hypothesis 2. The higher the number of perceived obstacles to innovation in the firm,
the higher the level of management innovation.

Solutions

The second part of the framework is concerned with the sources of possible “solutions”
to the problems identified above. We first look at the international scope of the firm’s
market which creates both awareness of problems and possible solutions to those
problems. We then focus on the different sources of new ideas that the firm can pick up
on, including those inside the firm, professional peers, and customers and competitors.
Consider first the issue of international scope. The wider the firm’s market scope,
the greater the number and size of competitors it is likely to face, and therefore the
greater the need for innovation. In contrast, firms operating in strictly local markets will
to some degree be shielded from competition and are less likely to invest in innovation.
=

<-----Page 12----->Such innovation will likely have a technological component to it, but it may also involve
management innovation. For example, when Toyota failed successfully to enter the U.S.
market in the 1950s, unlike its rival Nissan, it eventually had to pull out. The company
realized it needed a radical new approach to be successful in international markets, and
this stimulus, among others, led to the development of its lean production system
(Udagawa, 1995).
At the same time participation in international markets may also provide the new
ideas for management innovation, since it exposes firms to a much broader set of
management approaches in different contexts than the firm would get in its domestic
market. The ability to sense different environments and combine insights from around
the globe is increasingly becoming one of the distinguishing features and sources of
competitive advantage for firms (Doz, Santos, & Williamson, 2000). Firms with a foothold
in international markets are in a position to recombine ideas and sources of information
from various places and hence produce management innovation. Kogut and Parkinson
(1993) and Lillrank (1995) have argued that multinational firms are the key carriers of
management innovation across geographical borders because they pick up innovations
in one location and re-apply them elsewhere. The market scope of a firm therefore
influences both the need for management innovation as well as the capacity for creating
and implementing it. This dual effect will both force and facilitate firms operating in more
international markets to create more management innovation.

Hypothesis 3. The greater the market scope the firm is operating in, the higher the level
of management innovation.

=

<-----Page 13----->Turning now to the sources of new ideas, there is a well-established body of literature
that focuses on the role of external sources in facilitating technological innovation.
Some of this literature has focused on specific actors such as lead customers and
suppliers (von Hippel, 2004; Utterback, 1994). Another line of research, and the more
relevant here, has concentrated on the importance of a diverse set of external
knowledge sources as a driver of innovation (e.g. Ahuja & Katila, 2004; Hargadon, 2002;
Katila & Ahuja, 2002). By using more knowledge sources, it is argued, firms increase
their chances to find something useful in two ways (Leiponen & Helfat, 2005): first, they
will be drawing from the pool of knowledge more often, which improves their chances of
‘being lucky’ and finding a useful piece of knowledge; second, they stand more of a
chance of striking upon complementary knowledge because of the diversity of sources
they consult.
A similar argument potentially applies to management innovation. External
sources of knowledge can provide insight into new management ideas and techniques
that have worked in other settings. Moreover, the greater the diversity of sources the
firm has access to, the more likely it is that the insights gained from these sources can
be combined in a creative and valuable way (Hargadon, 2002). Anecdotal evidence from
Kaplan (1998), Kleiner (1996), and Whitsett and Yorks (1983) suggests that external
parties often play a critical role in the early stages of implementation of management
innovations. And Abrahamson (1996) describes how the diffusion of management
innovations was aided by third parties such as consultants and business school
academics. We therefore argue that the greater the breadth of knowledge sources used
by the firm, the higher the level of management innovation.

=

<-----Page 14----->It is possible to make this broad hypothesis more specific by considering the different
categories of knowledge sources that might exist. We focus here on three such
categories - internal sources (i.e. anyone inside the legal boundaries of the firm), market
sources (customers, suppliers, competitors, and consultants), and professional sources
(industry bodies, professional associations, and trade fairs).
The management fashion literature (Abrahamson, 1996; Staw & Epstein, 2000)
has stressed the role of market-based sources of knowledge as the primary driver of the
uptake of new management methods. Thus, firms mimic their competitors by
implementing management innovations that appear progressive (Abrahamson &
Rosenkopf, 1993), customers provide incentives to encourage firms to adopt new
practices (e.g. Guler et al., 2002), and consultants and suppliers often push
management innovations down the value chain because they benefit from the
standardization of processes.
Our approach acknowledges that but, building on the behavioural theory of the
firm, also gives important consideration to internal and professional sources.
Problemistic search has two important characteristics: it is simple-minded, which means
it proceeds on the basis of a simple model first, and it is biased towards the prior
experiences of those individuals pursuing it. If we apply this logic to the search process
for management innovation, we would expect managers with a problem to solve to first
speak to trusted colleagues inside the firm, and only once those colleagues had been
exhausted to look outside the firm boundaries (cf. Hansen & Løvås, 2004). Moreover,
we would also expect managers to put considerable faith in the ideas of their
professional peers outside the firm, perhaps more in fact than in the suggestions from
customers, suppliers or consultants. This is particularly likely in the UK where a very
=

<-----Page 15----->large percentage of managers belongs to a professional association, such as the
Chartered Institute of Personnel Directors, or the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
These professions represent a useful source of information about what is happening
across firm boundaries, but without any of the competitive consequences or costs of
working with market-based sources such as customers and consultants. In sum, we
expect that all three sources of knowledge will have a direct effect on the level of
management innovation, but it is an empirical question as to which category of source
has the greatest effect. Thus:

Hypothesis 4. The greater the use of (a) market-based sources, (b) internal sources and
(c) professional sources, the higher the level of management innovation.

Decision makers

The third element that arises from our garbage can framing is the ‘decision maker
looking for work’. This raises the question, which decision makers are most likely to be
looking for the type of work involved in management innovation? In general terms one
would expect the upper echelons of the organization to be more likely to have an
interest in management innovation than those at lower levels of the organisation, since
they are going to be most affected by the implementation of management innovations,
and management innovations typically have a large administrative component. The
demography of organisations suggests that employees with more educational
experience are therefore more likely to be active as management innovators because
they are more likely to operate higher up in the organisation and to be white-collar rather
=

<-----Page 16----->than blue-collar workers. Moreover, employing university graduates also tends to bring
in new ideas from the higher-education sector, as shown by Kimberly & Evanisko
(1981).
Chandler (1962) has provided the only detailed account of the likely background
of management innovators. He observed they were typically recent university graduates,
and that “possibly the rigor required in working out scientific and engineering problems
led these men to approach management needs in somewhat the same way” (1962:
317). He also observed (Chandler, 1962: 318) that “what Taylor, the Ford engineers, the
engineering journalists and professors, and the organization builders here studied had in
common were not specific ideas, techniques, or methods, but rather the same rational,
self-conscious approach to the management of men”. We therefore expect to see more
management innovation in those firms that employ people with the kind of analytical
background typical of those with a degree level education.

Hypothesis 5. The higher the percentage of degree-level individuals in the firm, the
higher the level of management innovation.

Substitution effects

Before moving on to the performance consequences of management innovation,
it is worth considered the possible tradeoffs and costs involved in the search process.
Any search process is costly and, as our behavioural theory framing suggests,
managers will sometimes short-cut the search process once an acceptable solution has
been found.
=

<-----Page 17----->Our argument here is simply that there are many possible sources of new ideas
for management innovation, and those firms that put too much emphasis on search are
potentially driving out implementation (cf. Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000). Or stated slightly
differently, search costs may be minimised by only using those solutions that are strictly
necessary to solve a problem. Rather than working with the maximum number of
potential sources and hoping that will generate the desired outcomes, firms may be
better of trading off one type of knowledge source for another type.
Specifically, we suggest that operating in international markets and using trained
decision makers are partial alternatives to the use of multiple knowledge sources from
different categories. Or stated slightly differently, roughly the same quality of information
that is generated by using more and different knowledge sources can also be found
through gaining access to large and international markets, and by using decision makers
with degree level training. The reason is that there are only so many possible
combinations of new ideas available, so as different methods are applied, the marginal
benefits of using them all will start to decrease. Hence we argue in favour of substitution
effects rather than complementary effects.

Hypothesis 6a. There is a trade-off between the breadth of knowledge sources (internal,
market, and professional) and use of trained decision makers, in that their joint
application will have a negative effect on the level of management innovation by a firm.

Hypothesis 6b. There is a trade-off between the breadth of knowledge sources (internal,
market, and professional) and market scope, in that their joint application will have a
negative effect on the level of management innovation by a firm.

<-----Page 18----->Performance

What is the impact of management innovation on firm performance? Despite its obvious
importance, this question has received relatively little attention and studies have not
reached conclusive findings. Damanpour and Evan (1984) argued that the impact of
management innovations on firm performance is often underestimated. Chandler (1962)
provided strong case evidence to support the argument that a major management
innovation (the M-Form structure) could lead to long-term performance improvements for
the innovating companies, though the nature of his study precluded generalization
beyond a single innovation. And various other studies have built on the assumption that
management innovation is good for firm performance but without providing any specific
arguments as to why (e.g. Gruber & Niles, 1972; Tichy & Nisberg, 1976; Stata, 1989).
Our argument builds on the standard principles of strategic management.
Innovation is the key internal process by which a firm differentiates itself from other
firms. The fruits of innovation, in the form of new products, services, or management
practices, are potential sources of differentiation, but imitation and substitution by
competitors often neutralises the effect of these innovations. Superior performance is
therefore achieved only when a particular innovation proves to be valuable, rare and
hard to imitate (Barney, 1991) or when a firm’s ability to continuously innovate gives it a
dynamic advantage (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997).
Management innovations have a number of important qualities that potentially
influence their ability to generate superior performance. They frequently exhibit high
levels of causal ambiguity (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982; Reed & DeFillippi 1990) because
=

<-----Page 19----->of the scope and complexity of the linkages between the parts of the system. Their
intangible nature may also result in time-compression diseconomies on the part of
would-be imitators, because of the deep-seated nature of the change in operating
principles they entail (Dierickx & Cool, 1989). It is interesting to note, for example, that
Procter & Gamble’s introduction of brand managers in 1926 was not widely copied by its
competitors for another ten years because they were not convinced of its merits.
These attributes suggest that management innovation can potentially be a source
of superior performance. Of course, this point is not meant to suggest that all
management innovations are successful, or that they all exhibit these characteristics
that make them hard to copy. Indeed, the “garbage can” metaphor for the decision
process in organizations suggests that the results are rarely optimal. Rather, we argue
in general that those firms engaging actively in the process of management innovation
will develop a stream of new practices, process and structures, some of which will result
in valuable improvements in the firm’s ways of working that competitors do not quickly
match. These improvements will then have a direct impact on the future performance of
the firm.

Hypothesis 7. Management innovation is positively associated with future firm
performance.

DATA AND METHODS

=

<-----Page 20----->To test our hypotheses we used the UK Innovation Survey, which is a national survey of
firm-level innovation conducted every four years as part of the Europe-wide Community
Innovation Survey (CIS). Specifically, we used the CIS3 data, which were gathered in
2001 and cover the 1998-2000 period. The UK survey is administered by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS) and commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry3
(DTI). The UK survey was sent to 19,602 firms, selected through a stratified sample, of
which 8,172 (41.7%) responded. These 8,172 responses form the basis for the empirical
analysis of this paper. Only about half of these responses proved complete enough for
our purposes though, meaning we test our hypotheses on a sample of 3,635 firms
employing 10 or more people4. Earlier work that has been published with CIS data for
instance includes Cassiman and Veugelers (2002) and Laursen and Salter (2006) and a
total of over 60 articles has been published using the CIS.
Because the survey has been administered by the ONS and was the third in the
series, no major data collection issues should be anticipated around this survey.
Lessons from CIS1 and CIS2 were implemented to improve the data collection process.
The core questions in the CIS are based on the OECD’s Oslo manual, which adds to the
comparability of findings across industries and countries. In addition the CIS looks at
manufacturing, construction and services firms. Questions were tested extensively for
reliability and validity. Respondents received ample guidance on how to complete
individual questions. Respondents received a postal survey and two reminders as well

Note that a firm in the CIS database is an “establishment” which may either be an independent firm or may be a
subsidiary of a larger parent firm. The establishment is likely to be the relevant level of analysis for investigating the
introduction of management innovations. Anderson and Young (2001) for instance show how Activity-Based
Costing inside GM and Chrysler started at the establishment level before spreading to other establishments within the
corporation.

knowledgeable of the firm’s range of innovation activities, including many Managing
Directors and Chief Financial Officers.

Measures

All variables were measured using scales taken from the CIS3 and ARD databases.
Specific wording is as follows.

Management innovation. Respondent were asked “did your enterprise make
major changes in the following areas of business structure and practices during the
period 1998-2000? And how far did business performance improve as a result? (a)
Implementation of advanced management techniques within your firm e.g. knowledge
management, quality circles, (b) Implementation of new or significantly organisational
structures e.g. Investors in people, diversification, (c) Changing significantly your firm’s
marketing concepts / strategies e.g. marketing methods, and (d) Implementation of
new or significantly changed corporate strategies e.g. mission statement, market
share5 (0 = not used; 1 = used).

In order to capture the breadth of management

innovation undertaken in each firm, we created a single scale which takes on the value
of 0 for no successful management innovation activity at all, with 1 added for each type
=================================================

This item is less clearly concerned with management innovation than the other three. We left it in for two reasons.
First, it is part of the ‘wider innovation’ category of the CIS survey and as such respondents may have interpreted it
in the same manner as the other three items. The high correlation between items (Alpha = 0.86) and the fact that
omitting the item lowers the reliability of the scale (Alpha = 0.82) suggests this is probably the case. Second, no

=

<-----Page 22----->of management innovation the firm engaged in, such that the maximum value is 4. For
all practical purposes the measure can be thought of as a count measure that provides
an indication of the number of areas of management innovation a firm engaged in6.

Organizational Change.

Respondents were asked “did any of the following

significant changes occur to your enterprise during the three-year period 1998-2000?”
Possible responses were: (a) the enterprise was established, (b) turnover increased by
at least 10% due to merger with another enterprise or part of it, (c) Turnover decreased
by at least 10% due to sale or closure of part of the enterprise, (d) None of the above.
We coded the results as follows: firms recording major changes by responding (b) or (c)
were coded 1; firms recording no major change by responding (d) were coded 0; firms
responding (a) were removed from the sample because they did not exist throughout the
entire time period under investigation.

Perceived obstacles to innovation. This is a count variable and measures the
number of factors inhibiting a firm’s ability to innovate. Respondents were asked “please
rate the importance of the following constraints during the period 1998-2000:

(a)

Excessive perceived economic risks, (b) Direct innovation costs too high, (c) Costs of
finance, (d) Availability of finance, (e) Organisational rigidities within the enterprise, (f)
===========================================================================================================================================================
empirical implications follow from excluding this item from the analysis: when we re-ran the models without this
item, no significant differences were found in the results.

Unfortunately this variable is far from continuous and its distribution is skewed toward ‘0’, causing potential
violations of regression assumptions. For that reason we use robust standard errors in all the analyses where
management innovation is the dependent variable. An alternative approach is to use dummy variables as dependent
variables. This could either be a single dummy, to measure whether the firm uses any type of management
innovation, or four separate dummies, for each of the types of innovation. We ran logistics regression models for
each of these dummies and the outcomes are very consistent with the findings presented here. Since using a dummy

=

<-----Page 23----->Lack of qualified personnel, (g) Lack of information technology, (h) Lack of information
on markets, (i) Impact of regulations or standards, (j) Lack of customer responsiveness
to new goods or services”. Respondents were asked to specify “no effect” or “low”,
“medium”, “high” for each item. We summed the number of cases where the respondent
gave a positive response, resulting in a measure varying from 0 to 107.

Market scope. This single-item question identified the firm’s largest market as
‘local’ (0), ‘regional’ (1), ‘national’ (2) or ‘international’ (3).

Knowledge Sources. We identified three groups of knowledge sources as
detailed below, and we calculated three separate count variables, one for each type of
sources. The wording of the scales was as follows: “Please indicate the sources of
knowledge or information used in your innovation activities, and their importance during
the period 1998-2000”:
Internal sources: (a) Within the enterprise, (b) Other enterprises within the
enterprise group (not used, low importance, medium importance, high importance)
Market sources: (a) Suppliers of equipment, materials, components or software,
(b) Clients or customers, (c) Competitors, (d) Consultants, (e) Commercial laboratories /
R&D enterprises (not used, low importance, medium importance, high importance).

===========================================================================================================================================================
implies a large loss of information over using a variable with 5 possible outcomes, we have chosen to present
ordered logit models here instead.
7
This variable could arguably be seen as a scale with 10 items as well. Statistically this is certainly possible, as the
10 items produce a unidimensional scale (Alpha = 0.94). We are interested, however, in the number of obstacles and
hence prefer to look at this as a count variable. The same applies to the different types of knowledge sources we will
discuss shortly.

=

<-----Page 24----->Professional Sources: (a) Professional conferences, meetings, (b) Trade
associations, (c) Technical / trade press, computer databases, (d) Fairs, exhibitions (not
used, low importance, medium importance, high importance).
In each case, any degree of importance indicated by the respondent was coded
as “1” while not used was coded as “0”. Given the number of items, the measures take
on values between 0 and 2 for internal sources, between 0 and 5 for market sources
and between 0 and 4 for professional sources.

Percentage degree-level individuals. This variable was calculated as the
number of employees with degree level education or above, as a percentage of all
employees of the firm.

Firm performance. We measured performance using a separate database, the
UK’s Annual Respondents Database (ARD).

The ARD is the government’s official

census data exercise and is executed by the Office for National Statistics. Although the
CIS contains measures that could be thought of as performance indicators, it has two
problems: one is the same-source bias problem that arises when one respondent
evaluates both the dependent and independent variables in a study; the other is the lack
of a time-lag between the measures of innovation and performance. Fortunately, the
ARD allows us to overcome both these problems, in that it is collected separately and it
measures firm performance for the three-year period following the date the CIS3 data
was collected. This effectively eliminates the possibility of “reverse causality” i.e. that
firm performance causes management innovation.

=

<-----Page 25----->The specific performance measure we use is the changes in the firm’s
productivity. We measure this by first dividing the firm’s turnover by number of
employees in 2003 and then repeating that for the year 2000. The resulting 2000
number is then subtracted from the 2003 number. This performance measure hence
contains information on both the firm’s ability to become more effective by increasing its
turnover with a similar number of employees and its ability to become more efficient by
reaching similar turnover numbers with fewer employees. This variable is a good
success measure of management innovation as it allows us to establish whether
management innovation leads to growth or efficiency.
Productivity growth = (2003 turnover / 2003 number of employees) - (2000
turnover / 2000 number of employees)

=

<-----Page 26----->Control variables. The ‘firm size’ variable was calculated as the logarithm of
1998 turnover, since the distribution of turnover tends to be highly skewed. For the
performance test the logarithm of turnover in the year 2000 is used, as we are trying to
predict changes from 2000 to 2003. The size of a firm is expected to have a positive
impact on its management innovation activities (Damanpour, 1987; Kimberly &
Evanisko, 1981).
The ‘capital intensity’ variable was measured as 1998 capital expenditures over
1998 turnover. Capital intensity is expected to have a negative impact on management
innovation. Management innovation, after all, is not concerned with capital in the
traditional sense of the word, though many management innovations deal with human
capital. Firms that have a high capital intensity can be expected to direct their attention
more towards other forms of innovation, like product and process innovation.
The ‘export intensity’ variable was measured as 1998 export levels over 1998
turnover. Export intensity may have a positive impact on the implementation of
management innovations because firms that supply to international markets generally
have to be more innovative to overcome their liability of foreignness.
While the knowledge sources we discussed earlier are an informal mechanism for
understanding innovations, technology alliances are a more formalised means for doing
so. Such co-operation agreements are aimed at the exchange of knowledge between
parties. Knowledge exchange on management innovations could be part of these
alliances. Therefore we also control for the presence of ‘alliances’ with other firms.
We also control for product innovation and process innovation following the logic
described earlier that it is more beneficial to undertake management innovation when it
supports other types of innovation (Ettlie, 1988; Georgantzas & Shapiro, 1993).
=

<-----Page 27----->Therefore ‘Product innovation’ is included and it is a dummy variable, with a value of 1
for firms that introduced any technologically new or significantly improved products
(goods or services) new to the firm during 1998-2000. ‘Process innovation’ similarly is a
dummy measuring the introduction of new or significantly improved processes for
producing or supplying products.
Finally, we included industry control variables. The firms in the complete sample
were distributed over 43 different 2-digit industries and a dummy variable was created
for each industry.

Common method variance

A potential problem that arises with the use of self reported data from a single source,
as we are using here, is common method variance. Common method variance could
potentially inflate the strength of correlations between variables. In order to assess
whether common method variance posed a serious problem in our data, we ran
Harman’s one-factor test (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986). If common method variance is a
problem, one dominant factor will emerge from a factor analysis. The Harman test,
however, produced multiple factors. In addition most of the variables included in the
analysis are reports of factual data, which are not really susceptible to common method
variance thus further strengthening the belief that common method variance is not a
problem in these data (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986).

=

<-----Page 28----->RESULTS

Table 1 contains the means and standard deviations of and correlations between key
variables. The table reveals that firms in the UK CIS sample scored fairly high on the
management innovation measure during the 1998-2001 period, although there also was
substantial variance between firms. It also shows that around 15% of their employees
had a degree level education, that many of these firms faced substantial barriers to
innovation, and that not many went through radical changes.

----------------------------------------------Insert table 1 around here
-----------------------------------------------

To analyze the antecedents of management innovation we use ordered logit. Standard
OLS regression is not appropriate because the variable is ordinal, with only 5 response
categories8. In the tables below the results of various analyses are spelled out. Industry
dummies have been omitted from the tables to save space. Various industries showed
up as engaging more in management innovation, including the chemicals, plastics,
machinery, furniture, computer software, and medical and optical equipment industries.
The industries that scored consistently lower on management innovation included
wholesale trade and construction. In all, industry effects did not predict much variance

=================================================

We also conducted the analysis using OLS regression, and the findings were very similar.

<-----Page 29----->though, suggesting firm specific factors are much better predictors of the implementation
of management innovation. Table 2 contains the results for hypotheses 1 to 6.

----------------------------------------------Insert table 2 around here
-----------------------------------------------

The models predicting management innovation are all quite strong and findings are
consistent across the models. Hypotheses 1 and 2 are both confirmed, demonstrating
that the existence of problems around rapid change and the presence of innovation
inhibitors are positively associated with implementation of management innovation. On
the solutions side we find support for hypothesis 3, predicting that management
innovation is most likely to occur in firms that operate in markets with wide scope.
Hypothesis 4 is supported for all three types of knowledge sources. Confirmation is also
found for the role of decision makers with degree level training, the presence of which is
positively associated with management innovation as per hypothesis 5. We ran a Brant
test to test for the violation of parallel regression assumptions and it turned out none of
our independent variables was significant on this test, which indicates that parallel
regression assumptions were not violated.
In hypotheses 6a and 6b we predicted the existence of interaction effects
between the use of knowledge sources on the one hand and market scope and degree
level trained decision makers on the other. Our findings actually paint a more intricate
picture than that. We do not find an interaction between professional sources and
market scope or between market sources and degree level training. And the interactions
=

<-----Page 30----->between professional sources and degree level training and between market sources
and market scope are only marginally significant. The two interactions that do appear to
be significant though are between internal sources and market scope and between
internal sources and degree level training. This indicates that there is only a trade-off
between the various types of knowledge that can be acquired internally. In other words,
there are trade-offs to the returns achieved by using internal knowledge sources in
combination with a broad geographic scope; and to the returns achieved by using
internal knowledge sources in combination with a highly-educated workforce.
Among the control variables some interesting additional findings emerge. The
synchronous innovation thesis (Ettlie, 1988) is confirmed, meaning that management
innovation is more likely to be seen in firms that also engage in product and process
innovation. Technology alliances do not appear to be a contributor to management
innovation. As expected, particularly given a wide range of firm sizes in the sample, firm
size is a strongly positive predictor of management innovation, while capital intensity is
not a predictor and export intensity is a marginally negative predictor of management
innovation in our models.
Table 3 displays the results of the OLS performance regression. It confirms that
management innovation results in higher future performance in the form of productivity
growth, as predicted by hypothesis 7. Interestingly, though, neither product nor process
innovation has a significant direct effect on productivity growth. As could be expected
larger firms are less good at increasing their productivity, in what is likely a catching-up
effect. More intriguing is the marginally negative effect of degree level training,
suggesting that having a well-trained staff results in slightly lower future productivity
growth. It should be acknowledged, however, that this model overall does not have a
=

<-----Page 31----->very high explanatory value, though that reflects on the use of hard performance data
that track changes over time more than anything.

----------------------------------------------Insert table 3 around here
-----------------------------------------------

DISCUSSION

The strong support we received for our hypotheses helps us to verify the usefulness of
the overall framework. The presence of problems, caused by either rapidly changing
circumstances or factors that stymie innovation, stimulates management innovation.
Likewise the presence of solutions, which are gathered through operating in more
competitive international markets and by applying a variety of internal and external
knowledge sources, leads to more successful implementations of management
innovation. And decision makers with degree level training are better at creating and
implementing management innovation. Thus the implementation of management
innovation is certainly consistent with the garbage-can model of Cohen et al (1972), that
is “a collection of choices looking for problems, issues and feelings looking for decision
situations in which they might be aired, solutions looking for issues to which they might
be the answer, and decision makers looking for work” (Cohen et al., 1972: 2).
But contrary to expectation, we did not find interaction effects between all the
kinds of knowledge sources and market scope and degree level training. The following
=

<-----Page 32----->can perhaps explain this finding. The process of management innovation is inherently
experimental. Such experiments seldom start out on a company-wide basis. Instead
they are introduced in a single unit or plant and then exported to other units. Therefore
the internal knowledge sources will tend to overlap somewhat with units operating in
other localities, which the market scope variable measures, and the two can be traded
off against one another. Similarly internal knowledge sources and trained internal
decision-makers could be producing similar insights. Thus the ability of firms to trade off
various solutions for one another is limited to internal factors, over which they have more
control to start with. So it seems that different knowledge sources are adding
qualitatively different types of information and there is an important distinction between
internal and external sources. In the absence of detailed information on what knowledge
is being exchanged we can only speculate what the exact differences are though.

Implications for Theory and Practice

The intra-organisational diffusion process and the underlying experimentation process
have received relatively scant attention in the fashion literature of recent years, which
instead has focused on diffusion across populations of firms. Based on our findings
there is no reason to deny the influence of outside market parties like consultants or
suppliers, or professional associations, both of which had a direct effect on the
implementation of management innovations, but we do think it is appropriate to aim for a
more balanced explanation that looks at internal experimentation processes more. How
do management innovations diffuse inside firms and what role do geographically
disparate units play in such diffusion processes?
=

<-----Page 33----->A further interesting finding that we discussed only briefly was that the type of
industry provides very little explanation for the levels of management innovation we
observed. Some of the diffusion literature appears to suggest that management
innovations like TQM spread through competitive mimicking or bandwagoning
(Abrahamson & Rosenkopf, 1993). If this is indeed the case, industry should be a
prominent explanation for the adoption of individual management innovations because
some industries ought to be far more involved than others. Here we find, however, that
the industry does not seem to be a key determinant of the level of management
innovation across a wider range of innovations. This could imply that perhaps industry is
not the force in the adoption process it was suggested to be by Abrahamson &
Rosenkopf (1993). More likely though, it means that although industries by-and-large
have similar levels of management innovation, the set of management innovations they
use varies from one industry to the next. Marketing innovations could be more popular in
the consumer goods sector while human resource innovations perhaps fit particularly
well in the services industry. The data used here do not allow for an elaborate test of this
thesis but it provides a promising future research question.
From a practitioner’s point of view several of our findings carry directly relevant
implications. The capacity of organisations for creating and implementing management
innovations is a consequence of problems they face, solutions they obtain from various
sources, and the qualities of in-house decision makers. And the creation and
implementation of management innovations appears to have a positive performance
impact, while product and process innovation do not. Gruber and Niles (1972: 29) stated
some time ago that “[t]he quality of management may be more important to success
than performance in the R&D of new products and processes”, and our analysis seems
=

<-----Page 34----->to bear out this argument. Our analysis seems to suggest that while product and
process innovation may be necessary conditions to keep up with the competition, it is
successful management innovation that is a necessary and sufficient condition for
shifting the frontiers of performance. Hence firms stand to benefit from increasing their
capacity for creating and implementing management innovations.
Our findings also suggest that this capacity for management innovation can be
increased by the use of relevant knowledge sources, specifically knowledge already
available internally and knowledge dispersed through networks of professionals and
through markets. And a presence in wider and international markets adds further to this
capacity. It can also be enhanced by well-trained employees, who bring in the analytical
capacity needed for management innovation. These findings suggest the possibility that
firms might start to consciously and systematically invest in management innovation.
The research suggests that such investments make most sense in large organizations,
organizations going through rapid change, and organizations facing consistent barriers
to innovation. As recently argued by two practitioners (Feigenbaum & Feigenbaum,
2005: 96), “[w]e find evidence in a wide range of industry sectors that the
systematization of management innovations will be a critical success factor for 21st
century companies”.

Limitations and Future Research Directions

Various limitations of the data employed here should be mentioned. First, even
though our management innovation measure is quite broad, it is not broad enough to
cover all types of management innovation. It does not, for instance, include important
=

<-----Page 35----->innovations in accounting or management information systems. Clearly a means must
be found to measure across a wider range of management innovations. Second, from
these data we do not get a good feel for how different types of management innovations
operate differently. Different types of management innovation may be prompted by
different causes, and this is not picked up at all in our analysis. Third, as is always the
case with secondary data, there are variables missing from the CIS survey that could
further inform our understanding of management innovation. In this case direct
measures of relevant variables like competitive intensity and firm structure and culture
are missing. Future empirical research can hopefully pick up those variables.
In terms of future directions, one interesting avenue for further research would be
a comparison between various countries. Strang and Kim (2005) raised the issue of how
the transfer of management innovations across borders between the US and Japan reshaped the innovations in question. Perhaps the antecedent variables of management
innovation therefore differ between countries. In countries like the United States the
uptake of management innovation takes on a more fashionable and crisis-driven
character (Abrahamson, 2004). In Japan, on the other hand, the introduction of specific
management innovation is perhaps more of a response to a specific problem. The CIS
data potentially lend themselves well to such cross-national comparisons because they
are collected in so many countries. A replication of our findings for a set of other
European countries is therefore not only desirable from the standpoint of simply
replicating the findings presented here but also as a means to test for cross-national
differences in the antecedents of management innovation.
Another question of interest is how management innovations get created and
promoted inside organizations. Davenport and Prusak (2003) introduced the notion of
=

<-----Page 36----->‘idea practitioners’, insiders who are both knowledgeable enough and connected to the
outside world well enough to launch management innovations. Where pure outsiders
like consultants and business school professors are often not trusted sufficiently to ‘sell’
a management innovation to an organization, idea practitioners are well-placed to do
that. The idea practitioners Davenport and Prusak (2003) mention all have a particular
background and experience that allow them to understand the link between
organizational problems and the set of possible solutions that exists outside their
organizations. Further research on idea practitioners could help identify under what
conditions such individuals come to the fore, how they come to be effective and what
can be done to strengthen their presence inside organizations. Such research likely will
have to take a micro-perspective rather different from the one taken here.
A third line of inquiry could look at the management innovation as the unit of
analysis. By that we mean an analysis of a set of historical or even contemporary
management innovations. Rather than looking at a cross-section of firms and asking
when or how they implement management innovations, as we have done in this paper,
this research project would look at a cross-section of management innovations. A range
of interesting questions could then be asked, such as how similar or different they are
with regard to the creation process, the conditions under which they were created, the
types of individuals who created them, the impact they had on the practice and perhaps
even the study of management, and their degree of newness. From there one could
perhaps venture into establishing correlations among dimensions of management
innovation to further develop a theory of the phenomenon.
Finally, the performance implications of management innovation deserve further
scrutiny. Our findings in this paper suggest that management innovation has a small but
=

<-----Page 37----->significant direct effect on firm productivity, but it would be very useful to take a closer
look at this relationship. Research might focus in particular on the conditions under
which management innovation proves beneficial, what types of management innovation
are more or less beneficial and what the consequences are of interactions between
management innovation and other forms of innovation. Ideally such research would also
use lagged ‘hard’ performance data, as we have done here, because such data provides
the strongest test of any performance claims.

CONCLUSION

In this paper we have addressed the broad antecedents and performance
consequences of management innovation. Using a garbage-can framing, we developed
a set of hypotheses relating firm-level problems, sources of solutions, and attributes of
decision-makers to the level of management innovation. The empirical tests provided
support for the main tenets of our model.
Management innovation is an important and we believe fascinating phenomenon
that warrants continuing scholarly research, and more so than is taking place at present.
Such research should particularly focus on those stages of management innovation that
we do not understand very well, namely creation and implementation inside firms. There
are also reasons to look at a wider range of innovations, especially the need to design a
‘theory of management innovation’. With that in hand, academics could provide better
advice to practitioners on what they need to do to improve their chances of creating new
management innovations through experimentation.
