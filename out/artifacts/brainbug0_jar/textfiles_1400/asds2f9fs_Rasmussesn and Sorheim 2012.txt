(Received 6 February 2012; ﬁnal version received 29 February 2012)
New technology-based ﬁrms face particular challenges in obtaining early-stage
ﬁnancing to develop and grow their business. Seen from the supply-side,
high levels of uncertainty make investors reluctant and create a liability related to
the supply of ﬁnancing to these ventures. This introductory article reassesses the
demand-side perspective to ﬁnancing of technology entrepreneurship by
considering how entrepreneurs can improve their chances of obtaining external
ﬁnancing. We propose that the perceptions and preferences of the entrepreneurs, the
content and presentation of the business case, the networks and the relationships of
the entrepreneurs, and the process of obtaining ﬁnancing are issues of key
importance for understanding how entrepreneurs can enhance the ‘investment
readiness’ of their ventures. We synthesize the papers in this special issue and their
contributions to research from the demand-side perspective. Moreover, we outline
prospective areas for future research and implications for practice.

Introduction
Over the last three decades a number of studies have shown the importance of new
technology-based ﬁrms (NTBFs) for wealth and job creation (Autio and Yli-Renko
1998). One of the key challenges for NTBFs is access to ﬁnance (Lindström and
Olofsson 2001). Whereas this may not be a general problem for the overall
population of new ventures, it is a speciﬁc challenge for NTBFs because of their need
for signiﬁcant amounts of initial funding to develop their products and services and
to gain a foothold in the marketplace.
For a new venture to gain external ﬁnance two conditions need to be fulﬁlled; the
founder(s) must decide to seek external capital and the ﬁnanciers must decide to fund
the venture. An understanding of both these events is necessary to draw conclusions
about the venture ﬁnancing process (Eckhardt, Shane, and Delmar 2006). Still, the
vast majority of studies on venture ﬁnancing are looking at the second event, by
exploring factors associated with successfully obtaining external ﬁnancing. This
implies a supply-side view of small business ﬁnance, focusing on how external
ﬁnanciers evaluate new ﬁrms. Hence, the majority of studies on ﬁnancing of

technology-based ventures have a supply-side focus, implying that they take the
investors’ perspective. There is clearly a need for more studies on the ﬁnancing
process of NTBFs that take a demand-side perspective by taking the entrepreneurs’
perspective on obtaining ﬁnancing. How entrepreneurs can improve the attractiveness or ‘investment readiness’ of their ventures has been an important focus for
policy intervention (Mason and Harrison 2004; Mason and Kwok 2010), but the
academic literature has devoted relatively little attention to this issue. This special
issue introductory article aims to highlight the demand-side perspective on
entrepreneurial ﬁnance research.
There are a number of studies on the role of institutional venture capital for
funding of NTBFs but these typically occur in later stages of development when the
ﬁrm has reached initial milestones, such as technological veriﬁcation and ﬁrst sales,
and are capable of attracting venture capitalists. Studies of business angels have
often looked at early-stage ventures, but only a handful of these have focused on the
role as investors in NTBFs.
For this special issue we issued an open invitation for empirical papers that could
provide insights into the early-stage ﬁnancing of NTBFs. We encouraged both
qualitative and quantitative approaches using the new venture, the ﬁnancing sources,
or a combination of these as units of analysis. The papers appearing in the special
issue have been through a double-blind review process and responded to comments
from two referees as well as the editors. The papers explore various aspects of the
process of obtaining ﬁnancing for technology entrepreneurship. The research
questions, data and methods, and the key ﬁndings of the six papers are summarized
in Table 1.
Taken together, the papers in this special issue shed light on several issues related
to how ﬁnancing for technology entrepreneurship is obtained. In particular, these
studies provide important insights related to the demand-side which shows how
entrepreneurs improve their chances of obtaining ﬁnancing. From a demand-side
perspective it would appear that four themes are of key importance for securing
early-stage ﬁnancing: ﬁrst, the perceptions and preferences of the entrepreneurs;
second, the content and presentation of the investment case; third, the interactions
and network relationships of the entrepreneurs; and ﬁnally, the process of obtaining
ﬁnancing.
This article proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide a background for
the challenges related to early-stage ﬁnancing of technology entrepreneurship and
outline a framework for research from a demand-side perspective. In light of the
demand-side perspective we will discuss the contributions of the papers in this special
issue and outline prospective areas for further research. Finally, implications for
policy and entrepreneurs are considered.
The demand-side of early-stage ﬁnancing
Given the market imperfections faced by technology entrepreneurs when seeking to
obtain external ﬁnancing, how can their chances of getting funded be improved?
From the supply-side, ﬁnanciers tend to base their funding decision on objective and
veriﬁable indicators of venture development (Eckhardt, Shane, and Delmar 2006)
and prefer to invest in ﬁrms with an established track record. From the demand-side,
entrepreneurs seek to lower the cost of obtaining ﬁnancing through selecting
ﬁnancing sources that are available at a low cost. Typically, this means that

internally generated funding is preferred to external funding, informal sources are
preferred to formal sources, and dept is preferred to equity (Myers 1984). Still,
technology entrepreneurs experience that gaining external investment incur
substantial costs, especially in the initial rounds of ﬁnancing (Carpentier and Suret
2006).
According to Carpenter and Petersen (2002) there are three reasons why high
technology ﬁrms may be particularly aﬀected by imperfections in the capital market.
First, the probability of success in high-technology and R&D projects are low which
makes the returns to investments uncertain. The high level of uncertainty makes it
diﬃcult for investors to make rational decisions about the investment proposal. This
will in many cases lead to rejection of the investment proposal, simply because
the investor does not want to invest in a project with such a level of uncertainty,
and the entrepreneur is forced to reduce this uncertainty before approaching
investors. The challenge for technology entrepreneurs is therefore, to transform their
companies, where the opportunity is characterized with high levels of uncertainty, to
the level where investors can evaluate the opportunity with their rational risk
assessment. Second, there is likely to be substantial information asymmetries
between the ﬁrm and its potential investors due to the specialized knowledge
involved. This makes it diﬃcult for outsiders to evaluate the prospects of the
investment with the same accuracy as insiders. This information asymmetry eﬀects
the interaction between the entrepreneur and the investor. Third, the collateral value
of high technology investments is typically limited because R&D activity is labor
intensive and physical investments are typically ﬁrm speciﬁc. Hence, there are few
chances to reduce the losses in case of failure. Thus, a key question is how the earlystage NTBFs can overcome these hurdles and become ‘investor ready’ and access
external funding.
In the following, we will discuss how these imperfections in the capital market
can be overcome from a demand-side view. In other words, what actions and
strategies can entrepreneurs and new technology ventures undertake to improve their
access to external ﬁnancing at acceptable conditions? We will brieﬂy discuss four
issues related to demand-side ﬁnancing and how the papers in this special issue
contribute to these issues. It should be noted that many of the papers also make
contributions that goes beyond the issues discussed in this introductory article.
The perceptions and preferences of the entrepreneurs
Empirical data show that the decision to seek external investment is inﬂuenced by the
founders’ perception of market competition, market growth, and employment
growth (Eckhardt, Shane, and Delmar 2006). These ﬁndings show that founders who
perceive their venture to have a potentially high value are more willing to invest their
time and resources in eﬀorts to secure external ﬁnancing. Moreover, the perceptions
of early-stage ﬁnancing are related to factors related to the individual, ﬁrm, and
external relations (Nouira, Klofsten, and Asa 2005). Moreover, entrepreneurs who
seek ﬁnancing for their venture have a number of diﬀerent options as sources of
ﬁnancing. According to the pecking order theory (Myers 1984), ﬁrms choose internal
funding before debt and debt before equity. Thus, the eﬀect of entrepreneurs’
perceptions is likely to be dependent on the type of ﬁnancing sought.
In this issue, Gabrielsson, Politis, and Shveykina assert that inventor
entrepreneurs and external entrepreneurs diﬀer in their ﬁnancing preferences. They

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:32 03 February 2015

E. Rasmussen and R. Sørheim

suggest that external entrepreneurs have a diﬀerent mind-set that makes them better
equipped to deal with opportunities and obstacles related to ﬁnancing and
developing university spin-oﬀs. In the context of university spin-oﬀs, however,
these diﬀerences between types of entrepreneurs seems to be less important over time
as the challenges of commercializing a novel technology and the team-based nature
of these start-ups exert an even more inﬂuential role in the venturing process.
Moreover, they also found evidence in the direction that the development paths of
these ﬁrms are embedded in a more complex picture, where the champions of the
ﬁrm becomes interwoven with existing and emerging social networks and
technological challenges. Gabrielsson, Politis, and Shveykina strongly advice against
using simple projections of the development path of spin-oﬀs based on stylized
entrepreneur-models.
Another paper in this issue, by Riding, Orser, and Chamberlin, adds to our
understanding of the demand-side by investigating the preferences of technology
entrepreneurs when it comes to ﬁnancing sources. Their study uses a novel
approach to investigate the types of ﬁnancing preferred by NTBFs by examining
actual applications for various sources of ﬁnancing. They found that ﬁrms’
preferences vary according to growth goals, the nature of ownership, age of ﬁrm,
ﬁrm size, and sector. Another ﬁnding was that ﬁrms that invest in R&D are
much more likely to seek equity ﬁnancing than otherwise comparable ﬁrms that
do not invest in R&D.
Taken together, this means that studies considering the ﬁnancing of technology
ventures should take into account that ﬁrms and entrepreneurs may diﬀer in their
preferences. Hence, ﬁrms with similar ﬁnancing needs and similar access to ﬁnancing
may prefer diﬀerent ﬁnancing options depending on the internal preferences and
perception. We believe that the implications of these diﬀerences in the demand for
ﬁnancing is far from fully considered in the existing literature and constitute a
fruitful area for future research.
The content and presentation of the investment case
To commit ﬁnancing, investors need to be convinced that the investment has
potential to become proﬁtable with an acceptable level of risk. It is found that the
preparedness of entrepreneurs inﬂuenced the investment decision of venture
capitalists (Chen, Yao, and Kotha 2009). Moreover, the entrepreneurs’ communication skills and personal attributes are found to inﬂuence investor decisionmaking among venture capitalists (Clark 2008). Thus, to build a viable investment
case and be able to communicate with ﬁnancing sources seems to be a key
competency for technology entrepreneurs seeking external ﬁnancing (Rasmussen,
Mosey, and Wright 2011).
In this issue, Brush, Edelman, and Manolova examine new venture readiness for
funding by angel investors. They provide an interesting account on how the
investment criteria change throughout the evaluation process of an angel group. To
pass the initial screening, it is important for the new ventures to fulﬁll a set of
tangible, objective criteria. Later, when the entrepreneurs are invited to face-to-face
screening sessions with the business angels, more intangible and subjective criteria
appears important.
As shown by Miloud, Aspelund, and Cabrol, the valuation new ventures by
venture capitalists is indeed dependent on venture-level aspects of the investment

case such as the quality of the founder and top management team and the external
relationships. This suggests that the initial robustness of the ﬁrm will aﬀect the cost
of acquiring external capital.
To sum up, it seems like the ability of the entrepreneurs to present and
communicate their investment case in a manner that corresponds with the
investment process of the particular ﬁnancing source is an important skill. The
entrepreneurship literature has paid increasing attention to how entrepreneurs and
new ventures make use of strategies such as symbolic management, storytelling, and
inter-organizational endorsements to increase legitimacy and access resources
(Lounsbury and Glynn 2001; Zott and Huy 2007). Several of the papers in this
issue indicate that this type of more intangible factors are highly important in the
process of receiving ﬁnancing (e.g. Brush, Edelman, and Manolova; Heuven and
Groen). We encourage studies exploring the strategies used by technology
entrepreneurs to present their investment case as attractive and receive ﬁnancing
from diﬀerent sources.
The interactions and network relationships of the entrepreneurs
We know that technology-based new ventures rely on many diﬀerent sources for
ﬁnancing, but the vast majority of studies considering the interaction between ﬁrms
and their sources of capital focus on a single source of capital (Cosh, Cumming, and
Hughes 2009). Hence, more knowledge is needed about the mix of diﬀerent sources
in diﬀerent contexts and phases of venture development.
It is well known that business angels and venture capitalists play diﬀerent roles in
the ﬁnancing of new ventures, but the study by Bonnet and Wirtz provides a novel
account on how these types of investors interact as co-investors in a young
technology venture. By using both agency theory and the cognitive approach to
entrepreneurial ﬁnance, Bonnet and Wirtz assert that the inclusion of business angels
and venture capitalists as investors may help to keep the overall cost of capital at low
levels because the two types of investors serve complementary roles. They conclude
that both cognitive issues and potential agency conﬂicts are relevant to understanding the fundraising process and that their relative weight crucially depends on
the speciﬁc stage of the process. Business Angels may be especially well suited to
bring down cognitive costs, whereas formal venture capitals (VCs) should typically
be equipped to control agency costs. Hence, the proper combination of diﬀerent
investor-proﬁles may help to keep the overall cost of capital at low levels.
Most countries have a variety of support schemes for technology-based
entrepreneurship and government grants and loans often constitutes a signiﬁcant
source of early-stage funding for NTBF. None of the studies in this issue deals
explicitly with government support but funding and support from public sources to
the ventures were evident in several papers, such as the study by Gabrielsson, Politis,
and Shveykina. For future research, studies on how government support interacts
with private ﬁnanciers would yield important insights into the early-stage ﬁnancing
of technology entrepreneurship.
Another issue closely related to the interactions between entrepreneurs and
diﬀerent ﬁnancing sources is the role of networks. Network relations act as a bridge
to access information and resources that supplements the entrepreneurs’ or nascent
ﬁrms’ own assets (Delmar and Shane 2004). Entrepreneurs often have limited
knowledge about the ﬁnancing alternatives available (Seghers, Manigart, and

<-----Page 11----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:32 03 February 2015

E. Rasmussen and R. Sørheim

Vanacker 2012). The types and amounts of ﬁnancing acquired by new ventures is
aﬀected by the established networks and existing relationships of the founders
(Atherton 2009).
The paper by Heuven and Groen provides strong accounts of the importance of
networks and relationships in the process of obtaining ﬁnancing for technology
entrepreneurs. In their studies of social networks, Heuven and Groen explore the
role of networks in the venture ﬁnancing process of four Dutch technology-based
ventures. This study acknowledges that new ventures can get access to ﬁnancial
resource providers both directly or through a referral. The study explicitly focuses on
two events in the early stages of the funding process; the identiﬁcation of ﬁnancial
opportunities and the actual access to ﬁnancial resources providers. Moreover, their
results show that the eﬀectiveness of certain network positions and relations largely
depends on contingencies related to the actors involved in the funding process.
Recently, more attention has been devoted to the importance of the
competence and networks provided by investors to new ventures. We believe
that this is a fruitful area for further research, particularly related to the nonﬁnancial contributions from diﬀerent ﬁnancing sources, such as provision of
resources, networks, and business planning. As illustrated by Bonnet and Wirtz,
one type of ﬁnancing source could play a catalyzing role in obtaining further
ﬁnancing from other sources.
The process of obtaining ﬁnancing
Prior research has mainly been dealing with the criteria used to evaluate investment
cases, rather than the process by which they are evaluated (Maxwell, Jeﬀrey, and
Lévesque 2011). However, the initial ﬁnancing structure of new ventures may not
only inﬂuence performance, but also the venture’s future capital structure and
development path (Hirsch and Walz 2011).
Several of the papers in this special issue have provided new knowledge on the
dynamics of the ﬁnancing process. For instance, Brush, Edelman, and Manolova
showed that diﬀerent investment criteria appear important at diﬀerent stages of the
business angel evaluation process. Bonnet and Wirtz’s study of interactions between
business angels and venture capitalists showed how their roles diﬀered throughout
the venture’s investment process. Moreover, the study by Gabrielsson, Politis, and
Shveykina keys into the earliest stages of the ﬁnancing process of university spin-oﬀs
and observes that the mindset of diﬀerent entrepreneur types inﬂuences the ﬁnancing
process. By following the ﬁnancing process over time, the authors reveal the
importance of paying attention to interactions and the context of the new venture.
Hence, their ﬁndings shed light on how new technology ventures develop their
competencies from interacting with their surroundings (Rasmussen, Mosey, and
Wright 2011).
Taken together, these ﬁndings show that many inconsistencies in existing
research can be solved by looking into the process. Thus, in line with the general
need for more theory driven research into the new venture formation process
(Rasmussen 2011), we believe more research is needed to delineate the intricacies of
the investment process. For instance, the link between sources of early-stage
ﬁnancing and later performance of technology-based ventures is not well established.
Access to data is challenging due to the typically long timescales over which such
ﬁrms develop. More research is needed that look at the ﬁnancial performance of

<-----Page 12----->Venture Capital

these ventures but equally important are studies considering other goals such as
employment growth, innovativeness, and social or environmental outcomes.
Implications for practice
The articles in this special issue provide a number of interesting implications for
technology entrepreneurs in their process of securing funding. In this introductory
article we have highlighted four themes of particular importance when trying to
understand how technology entrepreneurs can improve their chances of obtaining
external ﬁnancing. First, no funding will be obtained unless the entrepreneurs
actually take action and approach potential funding sources. Hence, the perceptions
and preferences of the entrepreneurs towards external ﬁnancing determine whether
and what sources of ﬁnancing that are sought by the new venture. Some
entrepreneurs may therefore need to reconsider their preferences towards external
ﬁnancing and particular ﬁnancing sources if they want to improve their chances of
acquiring external ﬁnancing. Altering the perceptions and preferences of the
entrepreneurs may also be an underestimated area for policy interventions seeking to
increase the level of external ﬁnancing for technology ventures.
Second, for investors to commit funding to a technology venture, they need to see
how their investment can become proﬁtable. Thus, both the actual content of the
business case and the way it is presented would inﬂuence the chances of obtaining the
desired type of funding. The entrepreneurs must be aware of who the receiver of their
funding requests are. For instance, an entrepreneur that approaches a business angel
network should seek to fulﬁll the investment criteria put forward by the network in
order to pass the ﬁrst hurdle. This means that developing a proper business plan is
necessary in order to start the dialogue with the business angel network. When this
ﬁrst hurdle is passed more subjective cognitive matters are taken into account in the
subsequent decision stages. However, the entrepreneur could follow an alternative
route by approaching investors with an industry background that is compatible with
the investment case. When this is the case, cognitive concerns are actually shown to
dominate the interaction between potential investors and entrepreneurs at the
earliest stage (ﬁrst contacts), and individual business angels could play an essential
role in this context. This means that the cost and eﬀort required in the process of
preparing for funding is related to what type of investor the entrepreneurs are
searching for, one size does not ﬁt all. In the early stages, it is of vital importance to
bring in co-entrepreneurs or investors that actually understand the technology and
business context. They could be catalysts in order to secure funding from investors
less familiar with the technology and/or the industry. The initial building of a robust
team could also reduce the actual cost of acquiring external funding.
Third, the process of obtaining ﬁnancing is complex and social in nature. Hence,
the interactions and network relationships of the entrepreneurs are of key
importance for succeeding with obtaining external ﬁnancing. The ﬁndings from
this issue highlight the importance of building and maintaining relevant networks in
order to get early-stage funding for technology ventures. In addition to relying on
direct ties to potential investors, third party referrals could also play an important
role when investors make their investment decision.
Fourth, the event of obtaining venture ﬁnancing is dependent on previous history
and has implications for the future. Moreover, most technology ventures obtain
external ﬁnancing from several sources and in several ﬁnancing rounds over time.

Hence, the process of obtaining ﬁnancing is decisive for the outcome. In this special
issue, ﬁndings point at the role that initial Business Angel investors can play for
securing VC funding at later stages. Hence, entrepreneurs would beneﬁt from
keeping a long-term perspective when seeking external ﬁnancing, as decisions made
early in the process may inﬂuence the type and extent of ﬁnancing available at a later
stage in the venture development.
The results from this special issue have also a number of interesting implications
for policy makers. In most Western countries, there are introduced diﬀerent types of
measures to stimulate the growth of technology ventures. However, surprisingly little
attention is given to the process of accessing external funding, such as preparing and
training the entrepreneurial team. Furthermore, the so called ‘investment readiness’
programs operating has to a large extent focused on presentation training and does
not take into account the whole picture. Training is of course important, but it is of
vital importance that the entrepreneurs understand the dynamics of the entire
process of acquiring external ﬁnancing over time. Moreover, the perceptions related
to the involvement of external investors should be emphasized when awarding grants
to technology projects with growth potential.
Conclusions
We believe there are abundant opportunities for further theoretical and empirical
examination of the ﬁnancing of technology entrepreneurship by using a demand-side
perspective. We hope this special issue can inspire further research and scholarly
debate.
