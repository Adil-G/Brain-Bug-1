By SHELLY LUNDBERG

AND ROBERT

In this paperwe discusssome simplenoncooperative models of distribution within
marriage in which the equilibria are not
necessarilyPareto optimal, in which history
and culture can affect which equilibriumis
realized, and in which distributionmay depend on whether resources are controlled
by the husbandor by the wife. Recent moves
away from single-decision-makermodels of
the family have permitted economists to
address distributionwithin marriage, and
models have played
cooperative-bargaining
the central role in these moves. The next
step is to permit strategic interaction between family members, by modeling distribution within marriageas a noncooperative
game. Noncooperativegame theory allows
great flexibilityin specifyingthe rules of the
game and, unlike cooperativegame theory,
imposes few a priori restrictionson the nature of equilibriumoutcomes. In particular,
noncooperativemodels neither assume nor
implythat all equilibriaare Pareto optimal.
I. Modelsof DistributionWithinthe Family

As Gary Becker (1981) has emphasized,
the analysisof distributionbetween spouses
begins with the marriagemarket.If participants in the marriagemarket could negotiate without transaction costs and make
binding, costlessly enforceable agreements,
then the marriagemarketwould determine
not only who marrieswhom but also distributionwithinmarriage.Because transaction

costs are substantialand agreementsmade
in the marriagemarket are very difficultto
enforce, we prefer to begin with the assumptionthat the divisionof any surplusis
determinedby bargainingwithin marriage.
The economist'sstandardmodels of distributionwithinmarriageare Becker'saltruist model and the divorce-threatbargaining
models of Marilyn Manser and Murray
Brown (1980) and of MarjorieB. McElroy
and Mary J. Horney (1981). The altruist
model provides a theoretical rationale for
the assumption that the family acts as a
single decision-maker.Divorce-threatmodels treat distributionwithin marriageas the
solution to a cooperative game, usually a
Nash bargaininggame, in which the threat
point is divorce. To examine the effects of
redistributionsbetween husbandand wife in
these models, consider two alternative
child-allowanceschemes: in the first, the
governmentpays a cash transferto the father; in the second, to the mother. Under
both schemes, in the event of divorce the
mother becomes the custodial parent and
receives the child allowance. The altruist
model and divorce-threatbargainingmodels
implythat these alternativechild allowance
schemes lead to identical distributions
within marriage.In the altruist model, the
equilibriumdistributioncorrespondsto the
point in the feasible consumptionset that
maximizes the altruist's utility; that point
is independent of which parent receives
the child allowance because the feasible
consumption set is identical under both
child-allowance schemes. In divorcethreat bargainingmodels, the equilibriumis
determinedby the feasible consumptionset
and a threat point that correspondsto the
utility of being divorced. The equilibrium
distributionis independentof which parent
receivesthe child allowance,althoughit will
depend on what McElroy (1990) calls
"extrahouseholdenvironmentalparameters"

that affect the well-being of divorced
individuals.
The abilityof policymakersto target successfully the consumption of individuals
within families (e.g., wives, children) depends on these transfers not being offset
fully by redistributionwithin families. Most
noneconomists who participate in publicpolicy debates concerning government
transfer programstake it for granted that
distributionwithinmarriagevariessystematically with control of resources.A growing
body of empiricalevidence suggeststhat the
ownershipof propertyand income received
by husbands and wives does affect distribution. Yet the altruist model and the divorce-threatbargainingmodels both imply
that targeted transfers will be ineffective.
This Ricardian-equivalenceconclusion, we
think, reflects only the assumptionsof the
standardmodels, not a fundamentaltruth
about distributionwithin marriage.
In Lundbergand Pollak (1993), we present the "separate-spheres" bargaining
model, a new cooperative model in which
targeted transfersneed not be neutral. In
the separate-spheresmodel the threat point
from which cooperative Nash bargaining
proceeds is not divorce, but a noncooperative equilibriumwithin marriage.Thus, the
threat point is "internal"to the marriage
rather than "external" to it. An internal
threat point could be specified in a variety
of ways;1in the separate-spheresmodel, it
is the solution to a noncooperativegame in
which a household public good is provided
by individualvoluntarycontributions.If the
voluntarycontributionequilibriumis a corner solution in which only one parent contributesto each householdpublicgood, then
targeted transfers (e.g., child allowances)
shift the threat point and, hence, affect distribution within marriage. We argue that
such corner solutions are especially plausible when traditional,sociallyrecognizedand
sanctionedgender roles assign exclusivere-

Ricardianequivalencedoes not hold.
II. Cooperativeand NoncooperativeModels

Most applications of game theory to
distributionwithin marriage employ cooperative-bargaining models.2 Cooperative
solution concepts, including the Nash
bargainingsolution, explicitly assume that
the equilibrium distribution is Pareto
optimal.Cooperativegame theorybegins by
assuming that players can communicate
freely and make binding,costlesslyenforceable agreements;the analysisfocuses on the
formation of coalitions (although in twopersongamesthe opportunitiesfor coalition
formationare severely limited) and on the
distributionof the benefits of cooperation
among the players. For distributionwithin
marriage,externalenforcementmechanisms
are absent: husbandsand wives lack access
to institutions that enforce household
contracts.3
Noncooperativegame theorydoes not assume that the husbandand wife can enter
into binding, costlessly enforceable agreements, but focuses on self-enforcingagreements, that is, on agreements that correspond to strategies that the husband and
wife would choose to carryout. The leading
noncooperativesolution concept, the Nash
equilibrium,is a profile of strategies, one
for each player, such that each player's
strategy is a "best response" to the other
players'strategiesin the profile.Nash equilibrium formalizes the notion that, if the

players were to meet in a pub the night
before the game and to agree on an assignment of strategies, then the only assignments that are plausible candidates for
equilibriaare those that correspondto selfenforcingagreements,that is, to agreements
the players would choose to carry out the
next morningin the absence of an external
enforcement mechanism. Noncooperative
game theory does not, however,model the
assignmentof strategiesto players.In games
with multiple Nash equilibria,there may be
no obviousway to choose amongthem.
Multipleequilibriaand the need to choose
among them suggest how history and culture might affect distributionwithin marriage. David Kreps(1990)points out that, in
many games, there seems to be a "selfevident way to play" that correspondsto a
particularNash equilibrium.He emphasizes
that which equilibriumcorrespondsto the
self-evident way to play cannot, in many
cases, be identified solely from the formal
descriptionof the game: in realistic social
contexts, conventional modes of behavior
may suggest a "focal-point equilibrium,"
thus reducing or eliminatingthe need for
pre-playnegotiationsor providinga way of
predicting their outcome. In the case of
marriage, social conventions regardingthe
responsibilitiesof husbandsand wives may
indeed suggest to the spouses a particular
equilibrium.
Repeated noncooperativegames typically
have multiple equilibria,and if distribution
within marriageis modeled as a repeated
game, equilibria will include both Pareto
optimaland nonoptimaloutcomes.The folk
theorem of noncooperativegame theory asserts that anyvector of feasible, individually
rational payoffs is a subgame-perfectNash
equilibriumof a repeated game provided
the playersdo not discountthe future "too
much."Thus, Pareto optimal outcomes can
emerge as solutionsto repeated games even
in the absence of institutionspermittingthe
players to make binding agreements. The
standard example is the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma: if the prisoner's
dilemma is repeated as a stage game forever, then it is well knownthat the coopera-

tive outcome("don'tconfess")is an equilibrium despite the inabilityof the players to
make bindingagreements.
III. An Example:MarriagewithVoluntary

Contributionsof PublicGoods

We now sketch a simple repeated game
in which both spouses can contributeto the
supply of a single household public good.
We assume that marriage lasts forever,
and the objectives of the husband, h, and
the wife, w, are to maximizethe discounted
values of infinitestreamsof utilities

where the p's are discount factors, the x's
are privategoods consumedby the husband
and wife respectively,and q is a household
public good jointly consumed by the husband and wife. Thus, interdependence in
the marriage operates only through consumption of the public goods: there is no
"altruism"in the sense of interdependent
preferences.The quantityof the publicgood
is equal to the sum of the individualcontributions made by the husbandand the wife.
Husbandand wife decide simultaneouslyon
the levels qh and qw they will contribute,
subject to the constraintsthat the expenditures of each spouse do not exceed the
spouse'sprivateresources.
In the repeated game, the voluntarycontributiongame is a "stage game" played in
each period, forever, with no borrowingor
savingpermitted.In the one-shot game, the
Cournot-Nashequilibriumis determinedby
the intersection of the public good "reaction functions" of the husband and wife.
The husband chooses Xh and qh to maximize UIh(xh, q) subject to q = qh + qw and
Xh + pqh = Ih where p is the price of the
public good, Ih is the husband's (exogenous) income and

Nash equilibria analogous to those in the
"battleof the sexes"game:one in whichthe
wife supplies good 1 and the husbandgood

are reversed. The husband and wife may
each prefer one equilibriumover the other,
but both will prefer a coordinatedprovision
of public goods to the alternativesin which
both supply the same good. The choice between these equilibria is likely to be sensitive to history and culture, which may
generate a "self-evident"way to play. The
separate-spheresbargainingmodel provides
an obviousexample:if some householdpublic goods are regarded as within the wife's
sphere and others as within the husband's
sphere, then a reasonablefocal-point equilibriummay consist of complete gender specialization in the provision of household
public goods correspondingto this conventional gender assignmentof responsibilities.
In this noncooperativemodel it is once again

tion game, corner solutions are crucial to
effective targeting. In the repeated game,
corner solutions are no longer crucial;the
folk theorem implies that every vector of
feasible, individuallyrational payoffs is a
subgame-perfect equilibrium of the infinitely repeated game. In the repeated
game, this set of equilibriashifts in favorof
the spouse whose resourceshave increased.
Thus, our analysis of the repeated game
confirmsand strengthensthe central insight
of the separate-spheresbargainingmodel:
that distributionwithin marriage may depend on control over resources.Whether it
does is an empiricalquestion.
