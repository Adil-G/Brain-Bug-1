Entrepreneurship
Research

Introduction

In the summer of 2008, the Jönköping International Business School invited a selection of prominent (and not yet past-zenith) scholars of our field to a workshop at which
they were asked to present their visions about where the future of entrepreneurship
research is headed. An important inspiration for this initiative was a similar gathering in
Jönköping 10 years earlier, which led to a special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and
Practice that has become one of the most cited in the history of the journal (see Davidsson,
Low, & Wright, 2001). Similarly, the current special issue is based on the ideas that were
first presented at the 2008 workshop, although they have since been thoroughly discussed
and developed through extensive commentary and revisions.
The decade that has passed between these two special issues has been something of a
golden era for scholars engaged in entrepreneurship research. The field has emerged as
one of the most vital, dynamic, and relevant in management, economics, regional science,
and other social sciences. The Entrepreneurship Division of the Academy of Management
increased its membership by 230%—more than any other established division—and with
over 2,700 members, it now ranks among the largest in the Academy of Management.
Entrepreneurship research has gained considerable prominence in leading disciplinary
and mainstream management journals. As a case in point, the best-cited—by far—article
of the decade in the Academy of Management Review was the agenda-setting (and
debated) piece by Shane and Venkataraman (2000). At the same time, the number of
dedicated entrepreneurship journals listed by the Social Science Citation Index increased
from one to more than half a dozen, the leading among them achieving impact factors in
the same range as highly respected management and social science journals. Most importantly, entrepreneurship research has become more theory driven and coalesced around a
central core of themes, issues, methodologies, and debates.

<-----Page 1----->The admittedly ambitious (or even pretentious) theme for this special issue is not a
preoccupation with the past but with the future of entrepreneurship research. However,
the future may be as fraught with risks as it is ripe with promise. Predicting the future
is always more difficult than explaining the past. As Abraham Lincoln observed, “The
best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time.” Trying to predict
where the future lies for entrepreneurship research is indeed no easy task and one
that could very easily go astray. As an alternative to predicting the future, one can
instead entrepreneurially try to shape it (cf. Sarasvathy, 2001). As John R. Richard
concluded, “When it comes to the future, there are three kinds of people: those who let
it happen, those who make it happen, and those who wonder what happened.” Similarly,
with reference to our own field, Aldrich and Baker (1997, p. 398) pointed out that it
“will be shaped by those who produce research that interests and attracts others to build
on their work.”
This issue, including our introductory reflection, should be understood with such an
entrepreneurial logic. Rather than conducting a systematic and comprehensive review
identifying all the relevant literature trying to draw out the trends, which certainly has
been done elsewhere, we instead focus on the issues that we think and hope will shape
entrepreneurship research for the coming years.

Articles Included in the Special Issue
Indeed, it is exactly the logic described above that underlies the contents of this
special issue. In “International Entrepreneurship and Capability Development—
Qualitative Evidence and Future Research Directions,” Erkko Autio, Gerard George,
and Oliver Alexy build bridges between the otherwise relatively separate field of international entrepreneurship and the core of entrepreneurship research by pointing to internationalization as an excellent context for studying more general phenomena. They also
make a link to mainstream management and strategy research by discussing how
dynamic capabilities first emerge, thereby showing how the maturing field of entrepreneurship can start to pay back to more established strands of research (cf. Zahra, Sapienza, & Davidsson, 2006). Autio et al. explore how future research in entrepreneurship
might think about how new capabilities emerge and solidify in new ventures that
are faced with fundamental uncertainty of their environment. They look mainly
to the literatures on cognition and capabilities in proposing an agenda for future
research to advance the entrepreneurship literature in the area of capability emergence
and establishment.
In “The Rewards of Entrepreneurship: Exploring the Incomes, Wealth, and Economic
Well-Being of Entrepreneurial Households,” Sara Carter takes on the task of starting to
rectify a major shortcoming of past entrepreneurship research. This is that—somewhat
paradoxically—despite allegedly focusing overly much on the role of the individual
(Aldrich, 1999), the field has not been very good at establishing what the rewards of
entrepreneurship actually are for business founders. While the problem of appropriate
outcomes assessment is shared by other fields of (business) research (see, e.g., Carton &
Hofer, 2006; Richard, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009), it is certainly a core issue that
needs to be addressed. By highlighting the role of the household, Carter also provides
important links to several other important developments in entrepreneurship research in
the last decade. These include the increased awareness of level-of-analysis issues (Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001), the insight that a large proportion of founder teams are spouses or
“romantic” partners living together (Ruef, Aldrich, & Carter, 2003), and the growth of
2

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->family business research as a subdomain of entrepreneurship studies (Chrisman, Chua, &
Steier, 2005). She points out the severe limitations of assessing entrepreneurial rewards in
terms of the comparative (reported) income accruing to self-employment. She goes on to
propose new directions for future research that focus on entrepreneurial reward structures
and decision processes, using multidimensional measures of economic well-being, contextualized within the entrepreneurial household.
Dimo Dimov, in “Grappling With the Unbearable Elusiveness of Entrepreneurial
Opportunities,” deals with one of the great promises and disappointments of
the past decade. The increased emphasis on opportunities arguably helped entrepreneurship research focus more on the very early stages of venture development, thereby
delivering on the promise of uniquely studying the emergence of new activities and
organizations rather than the relative performance of established ones (Gartner, 1988;
Venkataraman, 1997). However, as Dimov notes, progress has fallen short of expectations.
In his view, this is because the research stream jumped to a theory-driven, “normal
science” platform too quickly. He therefore attempts to trigger a new conversation about
entrepreneurial opportunities by distinguishing two conceptions of entrepreneurial
behavior—formal and substantive—and situating the construct of opportunity within the
latter. The article discusses three substantive premises for studying opportunities empirically: (1) opportunity as happening, (2) opportunity as expressed in actions, and (3)
opportunity as instituted in market structures. These premises stimulate research questions
that can invigorate and expand the study of entrepreneurial opportunities. Along the way,
he makes interesting critical observations regarding one of Shane and Venkataraman’s
(2000) suggested key questions for entrepreneurship research—“Why do some people and
not others discover particular entrepreneurial opportunities?”—and suggests modifications that follow from the logic he develops in the article.
In “The Business Model in Practice and its Implications for Entrepreneurship
Research,” Gerard George and Adam J. Bock discuss another “hot” topic of the past
decade, the “business model” (see, e.g., Amit & Zott, 2001). They show that the scholarly
literature is fragmented and confounded by inconsistent definitions and construct boundaries. Trying to save the concept from catch-all meaninglessness, they point out—with the
support of an investigation of practitioner use of the concept—what business models are
not and propose that future research reframe the business model with an entrepreneurial
lens. This would enable new directions for theory development and empirical studies in
entrepreneurship by linking the business model to entrepreneurial cognition, opportunity
cocreation, and organizational outcomes.
In “Entrepreneurship as Method: Open Questions for an Entrepreneurial Future,”
Saras D. Sarasvathy and Sankaran Venkataraman raise the provocative question that
perhaps entrepreneurship scholars have been thinking about entrepreneurship in the
wrong manner. They argue that by thinking of entrepreneurship as a subset of other
disciplines or treating it as a setting for testing theory from these disciplines scholars may
be making a category error. What if, they ask, entrepreneurship instead is best viewed as
a societal force at a much higher level, something like “democracy” or “the scientific
method”? Starting from this fascinating thought, they suggest righting the course through
posing a series of insightful questions based on a focus on entrepreneurship as a societal
level force for the alleviation of poverty, and the creation of wealth and well-being. This
also connects well with some of the later articles in this issue.
In “The New Field of Sustainable Entrepreneurship: Studying Entrepreneurial
Action Linking ‘What Is to Be Sustained’ With ‘What Is to Be Developed,’ ” Dean A.
Shepherd and Holger Patzelt suggest a future research agenda for the field of sustainable entrepreneurship, posing the questions “What is to be sustained?” and “What is to
January, 2011

3

<-----Page 3----->be developed?” Providing answers and insights to these two questions would form the
basis of an entirely new but important research area focusing on sustainable entrepreneurship. If adopted by researchers interested in this field, this agenda-setting article can
help this emerging field avoid many of the confusions and detours that have arrested
development on the topics of opportunities (Dimov, this issue) and business models
(George & Bock, this issue).
In “Contextualising Entrepreneurship—Conceptual Challenges and Ways Forward,”
Friederike Welter considers the different contexts for entrepreneurship, illustrating how a
contextualized view of entrepreneurship contributes to our understanding of the phenomenon. Arguably, the historically strong focus on the individual entrepreneur has been one
important factor contributing to frustrated efforts to overgeneralize results across very
heterogeneous settings within and across studies. In proposing a research agenda for the
future, Welter identifies challenges researchers face in contextualizing entrepreneurship
theory and offers possible ways forward. By discussing household embeddedness she
links to Carter (above) and in her treatment of spatial contexts she connects with Autio
et al. (above) as well as with McMullen (below). Although context awareness has arguably
grown in the last decade (cf. Aldrich & Martinez, 2001) and although the literature is not
completely void of previous attempts to help entrepreneurship researchers contextualize
their work (e.g., Low & Abrahamson, 1997; Zahra, 2007), Welter’s article provides a
welcome aid in dealing with this important problem.
The last article in our special issue is Jeffrey S. McMullen’s “Delineating the
Domain of Development Entrepreneurship: A Market-Based Approach to Facilitating
Inclusive Economic Growth.” Noting that development economics has favored topdown, planning-oriented strategies to poverty alleviation, the author sets out to define a
framework for understanding how bottom-up, entrepreneurial processes can alternatively attack and solve this problem, as well as how it can be subjected to scholarly
analysis. In so doing, he carefully delineates the domain of development entrepreneurship in relation to the adjacent and partly overlapping fields (and phenomena) of business entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and institutional entrepreneurship.
Putting strong emphasis on (and hope in) market processes and arguing that many cases
of alleged “market failure” are better understood as “government failure,” McMullen
acknowledges the critical importance of entrepreneurial initiatives that are not driven
solely by profit motives as well as that of institutions. Therefore, institutional entrepreneurship is one critical element in realizing the potential of dispersed agency and therefore a critical element in realizing development entrepreneurship as a force of poverty
alleviation.

The Building Blocks of the Future
While the previous decade in the future may be viewed as a golden age for entrepreneurship scholarship, it is far from certain that the breathtaking pace of development in the
scholarly field of entrepreneurship research will continue indefinitely into the future. One
of the main questions or controversies that only grow more acute over time is the question
of legitimacy as a bona fide separate and individual field, or rather as a topic of research
in the more traditional fields. The latter view is espoused by Sorenson and Stuart (2008),
who recently suggested that entrepreneurship would benefit from being subsumed by the
traditional disciplines, thereby at least implicitly refuting Low’s (2001) conclusion that
although seemingly contradictory, the views “entrepreneurship research belongs in the
disciplines” and “entrepreneurship research as distinctive domain” are, in fact, mutually
4

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->dependent. Sorenson and Stuart’s (2008) view makes it clear that the realization of the
vision of entrepreneurship as a bona fide field of scholarship lies in the hands of those
entrepreneurship scholars who create the future for the field (cf. Aldrich & Baker, 1997).
In line with Low’s (2001) argument, to be viable, such a field needs to create and/or
sustain attractive enough arenas for disciplinary contributors to engage in, to make use of
theories and methodologies developed in various disciplines where applicable, and to
show an ability to make sufficiently interesting contributions back to the disciplines. There
are a few essential building blocks that need to be in place for “entrepreneurship as a
distinctive domain” (and community) to be sustained and to be beneficial for cumulative
knowledge development.
The first essential building block relates to the very definition of the core concepts.
We strongly recommend that entrepreneurship research be unified as a field approached
theoretically and empirically in terms of the phenomenon. We propose that the phenomenon of “emergence of new economic activity” lies at the heart of entrepreneurship
(where “economic” has a much wider meaning than “commercial”). This might seem
like an obvious statement, but the past shows us that this has not been the case. Sometimes phenomenon-driven research is contrasted with theory-driven research. We do not
see a contradiction between theory-driven research on the one hand, and a focus on the
phenomenon on the other. Rather, the problem is that to a large extent, the entrepreneurship field has instead been unified by an interest in small, young, or ownermanaged businesses, that is, the context, with far less cohesion and agreement
concerning what it is about these small businesses and new firms that is so interesting
(the phenomenon). Rather, anything related to small, young and/or owner-managed
firms can be found under the rubric of entrepreneurship. Collectively, the works presented in this special issue take a clear stance on this issue and show the potential of
entrepreneurship research if the phenomenon entrepreneurship takes center stage. For
example, Sara Carter highlights the problematic equating of “self-employment” with
“entrepreneurship” in Labor Economics. As a consequence of this shift from a contextbased to a phenomenon-based view of entrepreneurship, clarification of exactly what
constitutes this phenomenon is needed. In the selection of articles for this special issue,
understanding of the importance of phenomenon-based definition and domain delineations is exemplified by Dimov’s and by George and Bock’s respective dissections of the
concepts of “opportunity” and “business model,” as well as in the respective delineations of “sustainable entrepreneurship” (Shepherd & Patzelt) and “development entrepreneurship” (McMullen). Although these articles seemingly deal with very different
issues, they converge on a view of entrepreneurship in line with “emergence of new
economic activity.”
The potentially most significant implication of this phenomenon-based view is that it
allows us to distill what exactly it is that is entrepreneurial about the things that we study
and thus, it establishes the boundaries of our field. There is a strong movement—not only
by scholars but by society in general—to extend the concept of entrepreneurship into new
domains, notably social entrepreneurship. Such an extension of the context of entrepreneurship is at odds with the context-based view of entrepreneurship; it breaks down
because the context provides its very foundation. One reaction to this has been that
scholars define, for example, social entrepreneurship to be outside of our scholarly
domain.
Another reaction has been to regard virtually all aspects of social change as constituting social entrepreneurship. A phenomenon-based view of entrepreneurship allows
us instead to specify which elements of social change constitute entrepreneurship and
which elements fall outside of the entrepreneurship domain. This is exactly what
January, 2011

<-----Page 5----->McMullen does in his article. A very important implication of this phenomenon-based
view is that it simultaneously makes entrepreneurship research narrower in scope but
wider in context. Not all aspects related to small and new business amount to entrepreneurship, but several phenomena in other arenas are entrepreneurial and can be
understood best by entrepreneurship scholars. Rather than defining our field in terms of
the context, it appears more relevant to remain sensitive to context in the way suggested
by Welter.
Given that we define our field in terms of a phenomenon characterized by change,
newness, and development that transcends organizational contexts, it is possible to start
addressing a much wider set of important issues. We are not suggesting that entrepreneurship is equivalent to social science in general and that anything can be placed
under the rubric of entrepreneurship. On the contrary, the phenomenon of entrepreneurship is present and appears across a multitude of situations and events. Therefore,
entrepreneurship scholarship has the potential to deal with issues that are central to the
development in the world. With such an approach, entrepreneurship scholarship
does not face the risk of being marginalized as the world develops and changes. A
striking feature of the contributions to this special issue is the extent to which they
see a place for entrepreneurship scholarship in the context of the development
of the poor world (McMullen), for the preservation of the earth’s resources
(Shepherd & Patzelt), and as a method for understanding human behavior (Sarasvathy
& Venkataraman).
A second building block where an integrated field and community has the potential of
doing better than dispersed, disciplinary (and often somewhat ad hoc on the level of the
individual researcher; see Cornelius, Landström, & Persson, 2006) concerns the relationship and concordance between conceptual definitions of key phenomena and empirical
observations. Intuitively, it is easier to study entrepreneurship in terms of the creation of
new organizations (Gartner, 1988) than as the creation of new economic activity (Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001) or opportunity discovery and exploitation (Shane & Venkataraman,
2000) because organizations are more conducive to observation and measurement than are
“economic activity” and “opportunity.” One option is to rely on conceptualizations that
are easy to observe or measure rather than those that are central to the field. This would
be detrimental to the development of the field (cf. Cooper, 1993). Several articles in this
special issue address this problem. Carter points to serious flaws and inconsistencies
pertaining to current operationalizations of the rewards of entrepreneurship, and suggests
possible future improvements. Focusing specifically on the concept of opportunity, Dimov
proposes that a substantive conception of entrepreneurial behavior, focused on what
entrepreneurs actually do, offers a productive alternative to the formal conception
grounded in economic theory. He then draws out the methodological consequences of
such a conceptualization, advocating controlled experiments and qualitative comparisons.
Sarasvathy and Venkataraman propose another radical approach. They suggest that history
shows that theories from the disciplines are poorly suited for observing entrepreneurial
phenomena. What is needed instead is to redefine entrepreneurship as a method of human
problem solving. This would lead to intense field studies of how entrepreneurs actually
apply this method.
Arguably, a third building block for the continued raison d’être of entrepreneurship
as a distinct field of research is that of relevance, that stakeholders outside of the “club”
find entrepreneurship research useful. One of the perils of becoming a mature field is
the development of a preoccupation with increasingly marginal questions and methodological subtleties, showing little interest for developments in other fields or real-world
application, and being of little interest for others than devoted tribesmen. Hence, the
6

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->rigor-versus-relevance debate in management research (Gulati, 2007). However, at least
judging from the contributions to this special issue, this is not (yet) a major concern for
entrepreneurship research. Instead, there are examples of efforts to give back to the
management mainstream (as with the origins of dynamic capabilities in the case of
Autio et al.). Above all, there is major evidence of great interest in entrepreneurship
beyond profit seeking on the micro level and with its role in improving society at large.
Ten years ago, Davidsson and Wiklund (2001) found reason to bemoan the rather singular preoccupation with the micro level in entrepreneurship research, and to point out
the crucial difference between ventures that enriched their owners at a net loss for
society and those whose retained profits dwarfed in comparison to their societal contribution. In the current issue, Shepherd and Patzelt, Sarasvathy and Venkaraman, and
McMullan all have a main emphasis on entrepreneurship as a force in creating “a better
world.” This is also mirrored in emerging strands of research on Social Entrepreneurship (Austin, Stevenson, & Wei-Skillern, 2006; Mair & Marti, 2006) and Institutional
Entrepreneurship (Greenwood & Suddaby, 2006; Maguire, Hardy, & Lawrence, 2004),
which this issue only covers indirectly through the three articles just mentioned. This
development arguably has been much helped by the abovementioned drift away from
associating entrepreneurship tightly with a particular type of organizational context
(new, small, or owner-managed firms). Defining entrepreneurship instead as a phenomenon that transcends context has a strong liberating effect on the possibility for entrepreneurship scholars to address issues that really matter and make important
contributions to scholarship but also to making the world a better place. One striking
feature of several of the articles in this special issue is that they show how important
entrepreneurship scholarship can be in pushing the development.

Conclusions
Scholarship in entrepreneurship has generated an impressive body of research reflecting a vital and dynamic field over the past decade. The works collected in this special issue
are devoted to the future. They jointly pave a way forward. We conclude on a positive note,
proposing that future entrepreneurship scholarship indeed has the potential of dealing with
the issues that are central to the development of the world. In this introductory chapter, we
present the building blocks that need to be in place for this to happen.
