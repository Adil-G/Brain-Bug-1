RECONSIDERING THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN
EXPERTISE AND FLEXIBILITY: A COGNITIVE
ENTRENCHMENT PERSPECTIVE
ERIK DANE
Rice University
Research suggests that as one acquires domain expertise, one loses flexibility with
regard to problem solving, adaptation, and creative idea generation. Here, I reconsider this trade-off between expertise and flexibility by examining the concept of
cognitive entrenchment—a high level of stability in one’s domain schemas. Proposing
that cognitive entrenchment varies not only with expertise but also with one’s task
environment and attentional focus, I contend that the inflexibility-related limitations
of expertise can be circumvented.

At the same time, however, research suggests
that, in addition to its benefits, expertise carries
limitations (e.g., Adelson, 1984; Frensch & Sternberg, 1989; Heath & Staudenmayer, 2000; Hecht &
Proffitt, 1995; Hinds, Patterson, & Pfeffer, 2001). A
number of limitations have been posited (see
Holyoak, 1991, and Lewandowsky & Thomas,
2009), many concerning the premise that domain
experts are inflexible in certain respects. For
example, experts may have difficulty viewing
domain-related problems from the perspectives
of others (Camerer, Loewenstein, & Weber, 1989;
Hinds, 1999) and adapting to new rules and conditions within their domain (Cañas, Quesada,
Antoli, & Fajardo, 2003; Sternberg & Frensch,
1992). These findings suggest that a trade-off is
associated with expertise. Specifically, as expertise is acquired, flexibility may be lost (Chi,
2006; Lewandowsky, Little, & Kalish, 2007; Sternberg, 1996).
In this article I review and reconsider research on the inflexibility-related limitations of
domain expertise by introducing the concept of
cognitive entrenchment. Defining cognitive entrenchment as a high level of stability in one’s
domain schemas, I maintain that this stability
tends to increase as individuals attain expertise
within a given domain. Furthermore, I suggest
that the cognitive entrenchment construct is integral to providing a common, schema-level account of why research indicates that experts are
often inflexible in thought and behavior. Specifically, I argue that because of cognitive entrenchment, experts may be restricted in their
ability to identify optimal solutions to problems,
to adapt to novel situations, and to generate

Through the course of human history, expertise has often been viewed as a valuable asset.
For example, in his Socratic dialogues, Plato
lauded the merits of expertise. Likewise, in the
Aeneid, the Roman poet Virgil proclaimed experto crede—trust an expert. Today, expertise
continues to be seen as a positive quality
(Bunderson, 2003a; Ericsson, Prietula, & Cokely,
2007; Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, & Strange, 2002).
In fact, from popular writings (Colvin, 2008;
Gladwell, 2008; Shenk, 2010) to the value industry places on subject matter experts (Alberts,
2007; Gandhi & Sauser, 2008) to a growing body
of academic work (e.g., Ericsson, Charness, Feltovich, & Hoffman, 2006; Ericsson & Ward, 2007;
Haerem & Rau, 2007), expertise is a much discussed and highly touted concept. Perhaps not
surprisingly, then, research indicates that expertise contributes to favorable outcomes in the
workplace, including effective decision making
and high job performance (Benner, 1984; Dreyfus
& Dreyfus, 2005; Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Hogarth, 2001; Kahneman & Klein, 2009; Klein, 1998;
McCloy, Campbell, & Cudeck, 1994; Prietula &
Simon, 1989; Salas, Rosen, & DiazGranados,
2010; Sonnentag, 1998).

radically creative ideas within their domain.
With regard to creative idea generation, I demonstrate how the concept of cognitive entrenchment helps resolve divergent views among
scholars on whether expertise fosters or impedes the generation of creative ideas.
A question relating to the present investigation is whether domain expertise and cognitive
entrenchment are inherently coupled. Toward
the end of my theorizing, I examine this issue. In
particular, I argue that although cognitive entrenchment tends to increase with expertise, at
least two factors are likely to moderate this relationship: the degree to which individuals engage in a dynamic environment within their expertise domain and the extent to which
individuals focus their attention on tasks outside their expertise domain.
In drawing together and synthesizing the full
range of arguments offered here, I conclude with
the observation that by taking into account the
concept of cognitive entrenchment, one can understand the roots of a number of inflexibilityrelated limitations of expertise and, critically,
recognize that these limitations are not inevitable. Indeed, individuals may be capable of attaining the benefits of expertise while circumventing the inflexibility-related limitations that
have been ascribed to it. Thus, the trade-off between expertise and flexibility may be less rigid
than typically conceived.
EXPERTISE AND COGNITIVE ENTRENCHMENT
To better understand what cognitive entrenchment is and how it tends to arise, we should first
consider the concept of expertise. In this section
I review extant research on expertise, examine
how expertise is structured at the cognitive
level, and describe the benefits it carries. Following this review, I explore the concept of cognitive entrenchment.
Conceptualizing Expertise
Expertise is a concept receiving attention from
researchers across a range of disciplines; thus, a
number of conceptualizations of expertise have
been proposed (see Sternberg, 1997). For example,
some sociologists view experts as those who have
obtained membership within a socially recognized professional community, such as law or
medicine (e.g., Rothman & Perrucci, 1970; Wilen-

October

sky, 1964). Sociological work on expertise tends to
be concerned with issues involving power, politics, and prestige— critical issues from the standpoint of professions and occupations whose reputations are closely tied to the perception that they
are communities of experts (Evetts, Mieg, & Felt,
2006; Gerver & Bensman, 1954). As such, sociologists often recognize individuals as experts by
virtue of their titles, certifications, or other socially
bestowed artifacts that confer professional legitimacy (Collins & Evans, 2002).
The concept of expertise advanced here is
grounded in a more psychological perspective.
From this lens, expertise consists of a high level of
domain-specific knowledge acquired through experience (Benner, 1984; Charness & Schultetus,
1999; Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; Ericsson, 2006; Ericsson, Roring, & Nandagopal, 2007; Feltovich, Prietula, & Ericsson, 2006; Glaser & Chi, 1988;
Schmidt, Hunter, & Outerbridge, 1986). Multiple experientially based routes toward expertise have
been proposed, including deliberate practice (Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Ericsson & Lehmann,
1996), implicit learning (Lewicki, Hill, & Bizot, 1988;
Reber, 1989), and experiential learning (Armstrong
& Mahmud, 2008; Kolb, 1984). Common across each
of these proposed pathways is the assumption
that acquiring expertise takes time as well as
appropriate feedback conditions. In fact, research
indicates that those who have reached worldclass levels of performance within their domain
tend to have accumulated at least ten years of
practice and training (Ericsson & Charness, 1994;
Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Romer, 1993; Ericsson,
Roring, & Nandagopal, 2007) and have received
accurate performance-related feedback (Hogarth,
2001; Kahneman & Klein, 2009).
Structure of Expert Knowledge
Scholars often argue that domain knowledge
is organized in the form of schemas—structures
containing “knowledge about a concept or type
of stimulus, including its attributes and the relations among those attributes” (Fiske & Taylor,
1991: 98; see also Harris, 1994; Markus & Zajonc,
1985; Marshall, 1995; McVee, Dunsmore, & Gavelek, 2005; Rumelhart, 1984). In probing the nature of the schemas that constitute expertise,
researchers have determined that two fundamental features differentiate experts’ domain
schemas from those of novices (see Bédard &
Chi, 1992, for a review).

<-----Page 2----->2010

First, expert schemas tend to be relatively
larger than novice schemas (Chase & Simon,
1973; Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981; Honeck, Firment, & Case, 1987). In other words, the overall
quantity of attributes or components contained
in an expert schema tends to be large (Fiske &
Taylor, 1991; Rousseau, 2001).
Second, expert schemas involve a greater number of interrelationships than novice schemas
(Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Kimball & Holyoak, 2000;
Lurigio & Carroll, 1985). Not only are the attributes
contained within expert schemas more interrelated but the linkages tying together different domain-relevant schemas are more numerous as
well. Collectively, these features—the number of
schema attributes and the number of relations
within and between domain schemas— determine
the complexity of an individual’s domain schemas
(Rousseau, 2001). Because of their size and the
number of relations typically found within and
between them, expert schemas are posited to be
more complex than novice schemas (Dane & Pratt,
2007; Rousseau, 2001).
Owing to their complexity, expert schemas tend
to be relatively detailed and accurate compared to
novice schemas (Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Narvaez &
Bock, 2002; Neale & Northcraft, 1990). For example,
the layperson’s schema of a professor may be that

581

of an individual who spends most of his or her
time teaching, thus not working during the summer. In contrast, a more expert schema of a professor, one held by professors themselves, would
add research and service activities to the catalog
of job-related duties and, thus, would include the
recognition that the notion of “summers off” is an
illusionary concept (example adapted from Rousseau, 2001). This addition of job duties to the
schema brings with it an understanding of how
these duties interrelate (e.g., professors who are
active in research can share their findings with
students to enrich their teaching). This example
highlights the higher degree of complexity as well
as the enhanced accuracy associated with expert
schemas. In other words, the expert schema of a
professor includes more attributes (e.g., research,
teaching, service) and a richer set of relations between these attributes (e.g., research enhances
teaching) than does the corresponding novice
schema and, in this example, is more accurate as
well.
In summary, domain experts possess complex
schemas—schemas containing not only a relatively large number of attributes but also a relatively large number of relations between the
attributes within each schema, as well as between the schemas themselves. Figures 1 and 2

FIGURE 1

provide visual depictions of these properties.
Figure 1 is an illustration of a novice’s domain
schemas. As depicted, there are relatively few
attributes within each schema and relatively
few relations within and between these schemas. Figure 2 is an illustration of an expert’s
domain schemas. Based on their number of attributes and interrelationships, the expert’s domain schemas are more complex than the novice’s schemas.
Benefits of Expertise
Research points to several benefits of expertise (see Ericsson et al., 2006, for a comprehensive review). As noted earlier, expertise may
increase decision-making effectiveness and job
performance in a number of contexts (e.g., Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996; Klein, 1998; Nee & Meenaghan, 2006). Expertise also enhances domainrelevant memory skills. For example, even when
only briefly exposed to domain stimuli, experts
display a remarkable ability to recall those
stimuli (Ericsson, Patel, & Kintsch, 2000; Vicente
& Wang, 1998). To illustrate, research indicates
that chess masters are able to recall the exact
position of each piece on the chessboard after
only a brief look at the board (Chase & Simon,
1973).

In addition, experts solve problems differently
and more effectively than novices. These differences have been examined in domains including physics and mathematics (e.g., Chi et al.,
1981; Larkin, McDermott, Simon, & Simon, 1980;
Sweller, Mawer, & Ward, 1983). In particular,
research indicates that experts tend to solve
problems in a forward-oriented direction,
whereas novices tend to work backward. For
instance, physics experts solve problems by selecting equations based on given information
and calculating unknown information to identify the solution. In contrast, physics novices begin with an equation that contains the variable
of interest and devise subgoals designed to ascertain the various unknowns in the equation—an approach less likely to facilitate effective problem solving (see Gick, 1986, for a
review).
Each of these benefits stems from the unique
“cognitive architecture” that experts possess. It
is because experts have complex domain schemas that they make effective decisions, perform
well, exhibit superior recall, and solve problems
adroitly (for more detailed discussions see Chi,
Glaser, & Farr, 1988; Ericsson et al., 2006; Hoffman, 1992). And yet, although expertise serves
individuals in multiple ways, research suggests
that expertise can prove limiting. As argued be-

<-----Page 4----->2010

low, the concept of cognitive entrenchment informs research on the limitations of expertise.
Cognitive Entrenchment
Despite the benefits of expertise described
above, research suggests that as individuals acquire expertise, they tend to become inflexible
in certain respects within their domain (Chi,
2006; Lewandowsky & Kirsner, 2000; Lewandowsky et al., 2007). For example, experts often
struggle to put aside the knowledge they possess when predicting how novices will approach problems or respond to events (Birch &
Bloom, 2007; Camerer et al., 1989; Hinds, 1999;
Hinds & Pfeffer, 2003; Hoch, 1988; Thaler, 2000).
Experts also exhibit a restricted ability to accommodate new rules and principles (Frensch &
Sternberg, 1989; Marchant, Robinson, Anderson,
& Schadewald, 1991).
Unfortunately, few attempts have been made
to integrate extant research by providing a theoretical account of why experts are inflexible in
a number of ways. With the aim of developing
theory in this area, I suggest that adopting a
schema-based view of domain expertise—a
view aligned with the discussion of expertise
provided above—may prove instrumental. As
noted, researchers posit that as one attains domain expertise, one’s domain schemas become
increasingly complex. However, in addition to
this rise in schema complexity, research suggests that, with the acquisition of expertise,
one’s schemas can become more stable as well.
In other words, the attributes comprising expert
schemas, as well as the relations connecting
attributes to other attributes and schemas to
other schemas, may become resistant to modification (Crocker, Fiske, & Taylor, 1984; Fiske &
Taylor, 1991; Goldstein & Chance, 1980; Scott,
1962).
Consistent with this claim, researchers have
found that the political views held by experts in
the domain of politics are more constrained than
the political views of others, which is due to the
stability associated with their domain schemas
(Larson, 1994; Stimson, 1975). Similarly, evidence
indicates that even as the features of an industry evolve, the complex schemas of industry actors tend to remain stable (Hodgkinson, 1997;
Reger & Palmer, 1996). More generally, scholars
have identified the stability associated with the
complex schemas possessed by organizational

583

members as a fundamental obstacle to achieving successful organizational change (Bartunek
& Moch, 1987; George & Jones, 2001; Labianca,
Gray, & Brass, 2000; Lewin, 1951).
I adopt the term cognitive entrenchment (or,
simply, entrenchment) to refer to a high level of
stability in one’s domain schemas. Although
cognitive entrenchment may not arise solely
among experts, the acquisition of domain expertise can lead to such entrenchment (Becker, 2005;
Sternberg & Lubart, 1995; Zell, 2003). The schema
stability characterizing cognitive entrenchment
may emerge, at least in part, from the frequency
with which experts tend to draw on their domain
schemas. In particular, because expertise is accrued through continual training, practice, and
performance (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; Ericsson
& Charness, 1994; Feltovich et al., 2006), the content and relations comprising an expert’s domain schemas are likely to be activated and
applied innumerable times. This repeated activation and use may stabilize the structure of the
expert’s schemas such that schema revision becomes relatively unlikely (Fiske & Taylor, 1991).
As such, cognitive entrenchment sets in. The
following proposition captures this effect.
Proposition 1: Domain expertise is
positively related to cognitive
entrenchment.
Figure 3 depicts this posited relationship. Intended as an organizing framework rather than
a full causal model, this figure depicts a number
of additional relationships and propositions discussed in the sections to come.
In further considering the nature of cognitive
entrenchment, one should note that such entrenchment is not always problematic and, indeed, may carry certain benefits—a point I explore later in this article. Nevertheless, the
entrenchment that often pervades expert schemas is notable in that it may account for a range
of inflexibility-related limitations researchers
have ascribed to expertise. In the following section I examine multiple lines of inquiry concerned with experts’ inflexibility and position
cognitive entrenchment as a concept integrating
these bodies of work. In doing so I illustrate how
cognitive entrenchment is related to, although
distinct from, concepts like fixation and habits,
and I demonstrate how the entrenchment construct enriches our understanding of certain areas of research and reconciles debates in others.

ACCOUNTING FOR EXPERTS’ INFLEXIBILITY
VIA COGNITIVE ENTRENCHMENT
Common across and driving the range of arguments offered in this section is the observation that schemas guide cognition within one’s
domain (Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Markus & Zajonc,
1985). Notably, individuals’ domain schemas are
activated when they are exposed to domainrelevant stimuli (Bilalić, McLeod, & Gobet,
2008a; Smith, 1998). In turn, these schemas influence what individuals attend to as well as how
they view and think about the situations they
encounter (Cooper & Shallice, 2006; Henderson &
Hollingworth, 1999; Marshall, 1995; Walsh, 1995).
This suggests that stable schemas predispose
individuals to respond consistently and, thus,
inflexibly in certain respects. As argued here,
schema stability—the essence of cognitive entrenchment— carries consequences that account
for a range of findings in research on problem
solving, adaptation, and creative idea generation. Each of these consequences is discussed
below and depicted in Figure 3.
Problem Solving
In research on the topic of visual perception, a
fixation is said to occur when one focuses one’s
gaze on a single feature of a broader scene
(Henderson, 2007). Somewhat analogously, research on problem solving adopts the term to
refer to situations in which one is focused on a
suboptimal course of action and, thus, is rendered unable to identify or develop a more effective alternative (Jansson & Smith, 1991; Smith,
1995a,b; Smith & Blankenship, 1991). In other
words, problem-solving fixation occurs when a

person becomes “stuck” attempting to derive a
solution to a given problem (Birch & Rabinowitz,
1951; Luchins, 1942; Rudolph, Morrison, & Carroll, 2009; Vul & Pashler, 2007). For example, in a
classic study Duncker (1945) found that individuals had difficulty recognizing the functional
value of a box as a support because they were
fixated on the idea that the box was simply a
container. Hence, they exhibited functional fixedness—fixation with regard to thinking of alternative uses for a familiar object (Adamson,
1952).
Among the most frequently demonstrated instances of fixation in the problem-solving literature are “Einstellung” effects, which occur
“when the first idea that comes to mind, triggered by previous experience with similar situations, prevents alternatives from being considered” (Bilalić et al., 2008a: 653). For example,
research suggests that people trained to solve
problems using a specific method are often unable to solve problems that are similar in appearance but different in terms of their requisite
solution method (Luchins & Luchins, 1959; see
also Bilalić, McLeod, & Gobet, 2008b; Lippman,
1994; Lovett & Anderson, 1996). In essence, problem solvers can become fixated on a particular
method to their own detriment when encountering problems that call for alternative solutions.
While problem-solving fixation can arise from
a variety of causes, such as experimental inducement (Smith & Blankenship, 1991) and delayed information feedback (Rudolph et al.,
2009), researchers have suggested that domain
expertise contributes to some instances of fixation (Jansson & Smith, 1991; Saariluoma, 1992).
When an expert’s domain schemas are acti-

<-----Page 6----->2010

Dane

vated, certain solutions are often immediately
brought to mind (Bilalić et al., 2008a; Gobet &
Simon, 1996, 2000). In some cases these solutions
may be well suited to the problem at hand—a
claim supported by the observation that experts
tend to be effective problem solvers (e.g., Chi et
al., 1981; Larkin et al., 1980). However, in other
cases these solutions may be suboptimal. To the
extent an expert cannot set aside a suboptimal
solution and derive a more effective alternative,
problem-solving fixation occurs. This situation
may be particularly likely to arise when experts
are cognitively entrenched. The stability of an
entrenched expert’s domain schemas may consistently bring to mind a suboptimal solution
and thus “block” potentially superior solutions
from emerging (cf. Smith & Blankenship, 1991).
Consequently, for those high in cognitive entrenchment, it may prove difficult to devise solutions beyond those activated when these individuals are presented with a problem.
Proposition 2: Cognitive entrenchment
increases the likelihood of problemsolving fixation within one’s domain.

Adaptation
Research indicates that the scope of experts’
inflexibility extends beyond fixation effects. Notably, evidence suggests that adaptation—
adjusting to novel task demands— can be a
challenge for experts (Cañas et al., 2003; Lewandowsky et al., 2007; Sternberg & Frensch, 1992).
Although an inability to adapt effectively is similar to problem-solving fixation in that each situation involves the repeated use of an inappropriate method, these types of inflexibility are
nevertheless distinct. Specifically, fixation
arises when one cannot recognize how to reach
a solution; failure to adapt occurs when one has
learned that a change in task conditions necessitates novel action but unwittingly fails to
adopt the requisite response (Lewandowsky &
Thomas, 2009). For example, in one study expert
bridge players found it difficult to adapt to a
modified game of bridge in which the bidding
procedure was altered (Frensch & Sternberg,
1989). In another study expert accountants
proved less adept than novices at using a new
tax law that rendered obsolete a previous rule
concerning tax deductions (Marchant et al.,
1991).

585

Furthermore, as noted earlier, domain experts
often find it difficult to take the perspective of a
domain novice (e.g., Hinds, 1999; Thaler, 2000).
As a result, experts may struggle to explain domain concepts to novices (Heath & Staudenmayer, 2000). Specifically, research has shown
that when experts are instructing novices, they
tend to use too many abstract terms and complex concepts (Hinds et al., 2001). These results
suggest that experts are often limited in their
ability to adapt their method of instruction to a
novice’s level.
In short, experts can be relatively slow to
adapt when circumstances call for them to do so.
This inflexibility may relate to the degree to
which experts perform tasks within their expertise domain in a habitual manner. Behavior is
rooted in habits—“learned dispositions to repeat past performances” (Wood & Neal, 2007:
843)—to the extent it is automatically triggered
by domain-related cues (Aarts & Dijksterhuis,
2000; Aarts, Verplanken, & van Knippenberg,
1998). Habits develop through behavioral repetition in a given setting and represent how one
customarily behaves in response to a given set
of stimuli (Neal, Wood, & Quinn, 2006; Ouellette
& Wood, 1998; Wood, Quinn, & Kashy, 2002).
Evidence suggests that habits are represented
within and activated by one’s knowledge structures (Aarts & Dijksterhuis, 2000; Aarts et al.,
1998; Murray & Häubl, 2007). Notably, habits may
be encoded cognitively in the form of scripts—
schemas associated with frequently encountered situations that enable individuals to interpret events and behave appropriately within a
given context (Abelson, 1981; Gioia & Poole,
1984; Harris, 1994; Lord & Kernan, 1987). Although
some scripts are shared among members of a
culture, such as scripts concerned with how to
order, dine, and pay at a restaurant (Abelson,
1981), other scripts are more personal or idiosyncratic (Demorest, 1995; Verplanken, Myrbakk, &
Rudi, 2005). As with their other domain schemas,
experts’ scripts tend to be relatively accurate
compared to those of a novice (Ashforth & Fried,
1988) and are likely to facilitate task performance (Gioia & Poole, 1984; Nee & Meenaghan,
2006).
When task conditions change, however, the
content of an expert’s scripts may be incommensurate with the altered nature of the situation. In
such cases an expert’s scripts and the habits
associated with them can lead to dysfunctional

<-----Page 7----->586

Academy of Management Review

behavior (Louis & Sutton, 1991; but see Hassin,
Bargh, & Zimerman, 2009, for an alternative perspective). Even when experts recognize that
their habitual responses are incompatible with
new rules, their potential for setting aside or
altering these habits may be limited. Indeed,
research demonstrates that existing habits can
hinder the pursuit of modified behavioral goals
(Verplanken & Faes, 1999; see also Betsch,
Haberstroh, Glöckner, Haar, & Fiedler, 2001).
From a cognitive entrenchment perspective,
an expert’s failure to adapt is likely due to a
high level of stability in the scripts underlying
the expert’s habits. For those with stable scripts,
exposure to situational cues may consistently
activate the same habitual responses, even
when such responses are no longer efficacious
(Bagozzi & Dholakia, 2005). In other words, as a
result of cognitive entrenchment, it is difficult to
disengage one’s habits. This claim equates with
the general argument advanced here that
schema stability accounts for inflexibility in
thought and behavior, and it points to the
following.
Proposition 3: Cognitive entrenchment
increases the difficulty of adaptation
within one’s domain.

Creative Idea Generation
Beyond enriching theory surrounding experts’
inflexibility with regard to problem solving and
adaptation, cognitive entrenchment may also
inform research focusing on another area in
which scholars have argued that experts exhibit
inflexibility: creative idea generation. Work in
this area of study suggests divergent, and indeed contradictory, possibilities. Specifically,
while some researchers contend that domain
expertise may be useful or even essential for
generating creative ideas (e.g., Amabile, 1996;
Ericsson, 1999; Weisberg, 1999, 2006), others
maintain that domain expertise can be a hindrance in this regard (e.g., Stacey, Eckert, &
Wiley, 2002; Ward, 1994; Wiley, 1998). Below, I
provide a detailed overview of this topic and
discuss how the cognitive entrenchment construct may reconcile competing positions.
Traditionally, researchers in the fields of management and psychology have tended to view
creative ideas as those that are both novel and
potentially useful from the perspective of a

October

given organization or domain (e.g., Amabile,
1996; Amabile & Mueller, 2008; Madjar, Oldham,
& Pratt, 2002; Runco, 2004; Shalley, Zhou, & Oldham, 2004; Unsworth, 2001; Ward, 2007; Woodman, Sawyer, & Griffin, 1993; see also Joas, 1996,
and Latour & Woolgar, 1979, for sociological perspectives on creativity). As scholars have argued, creative idea generation is one of several
activities concerned with the overall process of
creativity (see Lubart, 2000 –2001, for a review of
creativity process models). Other creativityrelevant activities in this respect include finding or recognizing problems (Getzels, 1979;
Reiter-Palmon, 2009), gathering relevant information (Amabile, 1996), evaluating ideas (Lonergan, Scott, & Mumford, 2004; Runco & Smith,
1992), pursuing sponsorship for ideas (Scott &
Bruce, 1994), and developing prototypes (Hargadon & Sutton, 1997). These activities are not necessarily pursued sequentially but, rather, may
occur concurrently (Lubart, 2000-2001; Scott &
Bruce, 1994). From an organizational perspective, such activities contribute to innovation—
the process by which creative ideas are developed, adopted, and ultimately implemented
(Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, & Farr, 2009;
George, 2007; Gupta, Tesluk, & Taylor, 2007;
Madjar & Shalley, 2008).
Fueled by the recognition that creative ideas
are critical to organizational innovation, adaptation, and survival (Baer & Oldham, 2006; Hirst,
van Knippenberg, & Zhou, 2009; Shalley & PerrySmith, 2008), research on creative idea generation has bourgeoned in recent years. Although
management researchers have devoted considerable attention to the social factors that influence the generation of creative ideas, such as
work environments, reward systems, supervisory styles, coworker support, and expected
evaluation (e.g., Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby,
& Herron, 1996; Amabile, Hennessey, & Grossman, 1986; Baer, Oldham, & Cummings, 2003;
George & Zhou, 2001; Oldham & Cummings,
1996; Shalley, 1995; Shalley, Gilson, & Blum,
2000; Shalley & Perry-Smith, 2001; see also Kasof,
1995, for more on the social and situational
foundations of creativity), evidence suggests
that creative idea generation is shaped not
only by social factors but also by individual
factors, including intelligence, personality,
thinking style, and expertise (e.g., Amabile,
1996; Barron & Harrington, 1981; Feist, 1998;
Glynn, 1996; Woodman et al., 1993; Zhang &

<-----Page 8----->2010

Dane

Sternberg, 2009). Of these factors, research examining the impact of expertise on creative
idea generation is relatively limited and, as
noted, points in divergent directions.
To make sense of the lack of research convergence on this issue, it may help to consider the
cognitive processes posited to underlie creative
idea generation. Although a range of processes
may contribute to the generation of creative
ideas (see Baer, 1993; Campbell, 1960; Dietrich,
2004; Mednick, 1962; Smith, Ward, & Finke, 1995;
Wallas, 1926; Zhong, Dijksterhuis, & Galinsky,
2008), some researchers suggest that a particular set of operations—“conceptual combination
and reorganization”— often spurs creative idea
generation (Baughman & Mumford, 1995; Mobley, Doares, & Mumford, 1992; Mumford, Baughman, Maher, Costanza, & Supinski, 1997; Mumford, Mobley, Uhlman, Reiter-Palmon, & Doares,
1991; Reiter-Palmon & Illies, 2004; Scott, Lonergan, & Mumford, 2005). Conceptual combination
and reorganization processes involve the combination of two or more schemas or the reorganization of the attributes underlying a particular
schema (Mumford & Gustafson, 1988; Mumford
et al., 1991). For example, linguistic history is
replete with cases in which two terms that appear unrelated, such as home page and conference call, have been combined to create novel
concepts that ultimately integrate into certain
lexicons (Ward, Smith, & Vaid, 1997).
A conceptual combination and reorganization
view of creative idea generation suggests a pivotal role for the complex schemas underlying
domain expertise. The large number of attributes contained in complex schemas provides
experts with considerable “raw material” for
generating creative ideas. Indeed, as one’s expertise develops, the number of combination
and reorganization possibilities rises owing to
the increasing complexity of one’s domain schemas (Mumford, Blair, Dailey, Leritz, & Osburn,
2006). However, to the extent that expert schemas are beset with a high level of stability,
conceptual combination and reorganization
may be hampered. For such combination and
reorganization to occur, schemas and the attributes that comprise them must be sufficiently
amenable to reintegration (Mumford &
Gustafson, 1988). Hence, with regard to generating creative ideas, cognitive entrenchment may
limit the advantage of possessing complex

587

schemas by preventing conceptual combination
and reorganization from occurring.
Taken together, these observations suggest a
tension between expertise and creative idea
generation. Experts have access to a stockpile of
concepts to combine and reorganize in creative
ways, yet the stability often found in expert
schemas may handcuff cognitive processes associated with generating creative ideas. Given
the distinct effects of schema complexity and
schema stability, it is perhaps not surprising
that scholars have posited a range of possibilities concerning how expertise and creative idea
generation relate.
In developing theory on this topic, it bears
noting that there are qualitatively different
types of creative ideas, each of which is likely to
be affected by cognitive entrenchment to different degrees. Specifically, some creative ideas,
despite being novel and potentially useful, tend
to be relatively “incremental”—that is, they represent refinements or extensions of existing
ideas or technologies (Benner & Tushman, 2003;
Dewar & Dutton, 1986; Tzabbar, 2009). In contrast,
other creative ideas are more groundbreaking or
unconventional (Dewar & Dutton, 1986; Kirton,
1976). These creative ideas, typically referred to
as radical, tend to challenge the status quo (Audia & Goncalo, 2007), thus representing a “clear,
risky departure from existing practice” (Ettlie,
Bridges, & O’Keefe, 1984: 683) and a transformation of the “accepted conceptual space” (Boden,
1998: 348) within the focal domain. Because
these two types of creativity vary in how much
unconventional—and hence nonentrenched—
thinking they require, there may be distinct relationships between expertise and both incremental and radical creativity, respectively.
Incremental idea generation, which arises
through “continuity with existing solutions” (Audia & Goncalo, 2007: 2), is likely to be feasible for
experts. Indeed, experts may be quite adept at
generating incremental solutions to domainrelated problems. As noted, experts possess a
large quantity of knowledge, which, in turn, provides them with a large number of concepts to
combine or reorganize. The conceptual operations producing incrementally creative ideas
are thought to occur through extensions or connections of well-established concepts within a
given domain and are therefore unlikely to require radical recombination and reorganization
(Mumford & Gustafson, 1988). In other words,

<-----Page 9----->588

Academy of Management Review

incremental creativity involves relatively minor
rearrangements of the attributes and schemas
underlying an expert’s domain knowledge. This
indicates that entrenchment is unlikely to
hinder the generation of incrementally creative
ideas. Thus, one’s potential for generating incrementally creative ideas is likely to vary directly
with the amount of domain knowledge one possesses. More knowledge implies a larger “network of possible wanderings” (Newell & Simon,
1972: 82) through which incrementally creative
ideas may be developed.
Proposition 4: The relationship between domain expertise and incremental idea generation is positive.
In contrast, to the extent that experts are cognitively entrenched, radical idea generation
may prove difficult to achieve at a high level of
expertise. Radical ideas arise through combining disparate schemas or substantially reorganizing the attributes underlying a particular
schema (Baughman & Mumford, 1995; Mobley et
al., 1992; Mumford & Gustafson, 1988). Insofar as
experts are entrenched, the stability of their
schemas may limit their ability to flexibly combine and reorganize concepts in a manner that
departs from established paradigms or patterns
of thought within their domain (Mumford et al.,
2006; Mumford & Gustafson, 1988).
Proposition 5: Cognitive entrenchment
limits radical idea generation within
one’s domain.
In sum, while expertise provides individuals
with a large number of domain concepts to combine and reorganize so as to generate creative
ideas, it also tends to lead to cognitive entrenchment, which, in turn, limits radical idea generation. As a result, one’s ability to generate radically creative ideas may be higher at a
moderate, as opposed to a high, level of domain
expertise—a claim that equates with a limited
body of empirical research pertinent to this topic
(e.g., Audia & Goncalo, 2007; Lehmann, 1958,
1960).
Proposition 6: The relationship between domain expertise and radical
idea generation takes the form of an
inverted U.
Intriguingly, this proposition echoes Kuhn’s
classic observation that those who are relative

October

newcomers to a given domain are more likely
than the most experienced domain experts to
conceive radically new scientific paradigms because they are “little committed by prior practice to the traditional rules of normal science”
(1962: 90; for a counterpoint see Wray, 2003). It
should be noted, however, that while Kuhn
stakes his claim on issues surrounding social
forces, such as vested interests, the arguments
offered above suggest an alternative but perhaps complementary cognitive-level phenomenon accounting for why generating radically
creative ideas can be difficult for experts (i.e.,
cognitive entrenchment).
Bringing together the full range of claims advanced thus far in this article, research suggests
that expert knowledge is stored in complex cognitive schemas. Experts’ complex schemas tend
to be highly stable—a condition referred to here
as cognitive entrenchment. Cognitive entrenchment provides a schema-level explanation for
why experts tend to be inflexible in a number of
respects. In addition, the entrenchment construct informs our understanding of how expertise relates to incremental and radical idea generation.
The consequences of cognitive entrenchment
discussed above raise a key question. Specifically, are all experts equally subject to entrenchment, or does entrenchment vary across
experts such that some may attain the benefits
of expertise without being subjected to its inflexibility-related limitations? In the next section I address this question by arguing that the
emergence of cognitive entrenchment is not a
foregone conclusion for all experts.
FACTORS MODERATING THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND
COGNITIVE ENTRENCHMENT
Scholars argue that the schema stability characterizing cognitive entrenchment tends to be
resilient to inconsistency and difficult to modify
(Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Reger & Palmer, 1996). This
observation complements work indicating that
people’s beliefs tend to persist, even in the face
of disconfirming evidence (e.g., Anderson, Lepper, & Ross, 1980; Anderson & Lindsay, 1998;
Nickerson, 1998). However, while cognitive entrenchment, once established, can prove recalcitrant, not all domain experts necessarily become highly entrenched. On the contrary, the

<-----Page 10----->2010

Dane

relationship between domain expertise and cognitive entrenchment proposed earlier may vary
with at least two factors: (1) the degree to which
one engages in a dynamic environment within
one’s expertise domain and (2) the degree to
which one focuses attention on tasks outside
one’s expertise domain (see Figure 3). While
these factors may not represent an exhaustive
set of factors worth considering—a point I revisit
toward the end of this article—they are noteworthy in that extant research hints at their importance and they share a common mechanism.
Specifically, both factors discussed below help
individuals maintain sufficient “doubt” (Locke,
Golden-Biddle, & Feldman, 2008) concerning the
extent of their own domain knowledge such that
their schemas remain malleable.
Engaging in a Dynamic Environment
To begin, the relationship between domain
expertise and cognitive entrenchment may be
contingent on whether and to what extent one
engages in a dynamic environment within one’s
domain. Dynamic environments require individuals to respond to changing conditions by making a series of interdependent decisions in real
time (Edwards, 1962; Gonzalez, 2005). These environments are found in a number of domains,
including those involving emergency response
operations, such as firefighting (Klein, 1998), and
those calling for behavior that is either highly
collaborative, such as improvisational theater
(Vera & Crossan, 2004), or inherently adversarial, such as trial law (Dane, 2008). In addition,
evidence suggests that dynamic environments
can be found in high-velocity industries—
industries that involve intense competition and
rapid change (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988;
Nadkarni & Barr, 2008).
To perform tasks effectively in a dynamic environment, individuals must remain open to a
wide range of possibilities, options, and information, as opposed to relying on a limited set of
inputs (Atkins, Wood, & Rutgers, 2002; Eisenhardt, 1989; Weick, 1993). This is due to the unpredictability of such environments (Brehmer,
1992; Edwards, 1962). Because events in a dynamic environment rarely proceed exactly as
anticipated, one must be prepared to adapt
(Gonzalez, Lerch, & Lebiere, 2003). The unpredictability and surprises associated with dynamic environments may lead individuals to

589

question the relationships among features of
their domain (Farjoun, 2010). In particular, when
a given action is followed by an unexpected
outcome, one’s certitude about what “is” may be
supplanted with doubt concerning cause-andeffect relationships (Locke et al., 2008; Peirce,
1931–1958; Starbuck, 1996; Weick, 1993).
Although excessive doubt can be problematic
in that it may reduce conviction (Srikantia &
Pasmore, 1996), some level of doubt can be useful in certain respects. Researchers argue that
doubt helps generate new perspectives by reducing habitual behavior, fostering creativity,
and motivating a search for discovery (Locke et
al., 2008; Maitlis & Sonenshein, 2010). Indeed,
some have pointed to doubt as a critical feature
of “wisdom” (Meacham, 1983; Sutton & Hargadon, 1996; Weick, 1993). As suggested here, doubt
arises when one’s beliefs about cause-andeffect relationships within a domain are brought
into question (Farjoun, 2010; Locke et al., 2008;
Starbuck, 1996), which provokes a need for updating or restructuring these beliefs (Christianson, Farkas, Sutcliffe, & Weick, 2009; Maitlis &
Sonenshein, 2010; Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld,
2005). To the extent this updating occurs at the
schematic level, it represents a reduction in
entrenchment.
Proposition 7: Engaging in a dynamic
environment within one’s domain attenuates the relationship between
domain expertise and cognitive
entrenchment.
Focusing Attention on Outside-Domain Tasks
The relationship between domain expertise
and cognitive entrenchment may also depend
on how one focuses one’s attention, or takes
“possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form,
of one out of what seem several simultaneously
possible objects or trains of thought” (James,
1890: 403– 404). While researchers have demonstrated that attending to tasks within one’s domain is critical for developing expertise (see
Engeström, Engeström, & Kärkkäinen, 1995), one
may be able to avoid cognitive entrenchment by
focusing attention on tasks in other domains
(outside-domain tasks). Although few scholars
have explored this possibility at length, some
have suggested it. For example, Hargadon
notes, “Having one foot outside your world

<-----Page 11----->590

Academy of Management Review

means you can be less beholden to the ties that
would otherwise bind and blind you in that
world” (2006: 209). Likewise, Berns asserts, “It
typically takes a novel stimulus— either a new
piece of information or getting out of the environment in which an individual has become
comfortable—to jolt attentional systems awake
and reconfigure both perception and imagination” (2008: 57–58).
In focusing attention on outside-domain tasks,
individuals are likely to encounter exceptions or
counterexamples to what they believe to be true
(cf. Langer, 1989a,b). Encountering exceptions
may, in turn, lead individuals to view stimuli
within their expertise domain in more conditional
terms—that is, that a given object could be something rather than is something (Langer & Piper,
1987). For example, a repair technician is likely to
view duct tape as an adhesive. However, through
outside-domain involvement, this technician may
recognize that there is a range of additional applications of duct tape, including its debated but
intriguing medical role as a wart remover (see
Focht, Spicer, & Fairchok, 2002).
Encountering exceptions through attending to
other domains may foster doubt concerning how
much one really knows about features in one’s
expertise domain (Srikantia & Pasmore, 1996). This
doubt may produce a loosening of the relationships underlying one’s domain schemas. In support of this claim, research on the modification of
belief-based schemas suggests that when individuals encounter exceptions or inconsistencies,
some degree of schema revision can occur
(Crocker et al., 1984; George & Jones, 2001; Weber &
Crocker, 1983). For example, upon meeting a casually dressed lawyer, one may modify the “dressrelated” attribute contained within one’s schema
of a lawyer to reflect the fact that while many
lawyers tend to dress formally, some do not (cf.
Weber & Crocker, 1983). Taken together, these observations suggest the following.
Proposition 8: Attending to outsidedomain tasks attenuates the relationship between domain expertise and
cognitive entrenchment.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
For centuries people have extolled the benefits of expertise. In recent years, however, researchers have identified cases in which exper-

October

tise appears to be more of a burden than a boon
(e.g., Birch & Bloom, 2007; Heath & Staudenmayer, 2000; Hinds et al., 2001). Work in this area
suggests the existence of a trade-off between
expertise and flexibility such that flexibility is
sacrificed as expertise is acquired—an assumption reflected in claims that, benefits aside, expertise is a “curse” (Hinds, 1999), carries a
“price” (Hecht & Proffitt, 1995), and has a “dark
side” (Castel, McCabe, Roediger, & Heitman,
2007).
In this article I reconsidered the assumption
that expertise and inflexibility are inextricably
linked and offered a schema-level explanation
for why some experts are likely to be inflexible
while others are not. Taken together, my arguments suggest that the inflexibility-related limitations often ascribed to expertise are more accurately classified as consequences of cognitive
entrenchment—a high level of stability in one’s
domain schemas. If, in fact, entrenchment were
an unavoidable outcome of expertise, or even
simply a defining characteristic of it, this distinction could be considered either trivial or redundant. However, this article points to neither
of these conclusions. Rather, it implies that individuals can reap the benefits of expertise
while foregoing its inflexibility-related limitations. As argued, individuals may avoid becoming highly entrenched by engaging in a dynamic environment within their expertise
domain or performing tasks in other domains.
When considered in conjunction with research
on expertise, these arguments—particularly
those concerned with outside-domain tasks—
carry novel implications.
To begin, research has shown expertise to be
domain specific. In other words, attaining expertise in one domain does not typically enhance
one’s expertise in other domains (Chi, 2006; Feltovich et al., 2006; Lewandowsky et al., 2007; but
see Barnett & Koslowski, 2002, for a counterpoint). Additionally, to acquire expertise in a
given domain, one must engage in a significant
amount of domain-related practice and training
(Ericsson, 1996, 2006; Ericsson & Charness, 1994;
Ericsson et al., 1993; Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996).
From an attentional focus standpoint, this suggests that individuals pursuing expertise within
a particular domain should focus their attention
predominantly on tasks within that domain.
However, as noted earlier, expertise acquisition
can lead to cognitive entrenchment. To avoid

<-----Page 12----->2010

Dane

such entrenchment, I suggested that experts
should focus their attention more widely—
toward tasks and activities not only within but
also outside their domain. Therefore, while expertise may not be readily transferable across
domains, there is merit to outside-domain participation precisely because of the domain specificity of expertise. By performing tasks in other
domains, individuals are likely to encounter
doubt-inducing exceptions to what they believe
to be true about their domain of expertise, thus
preserving their potential for flexible thinking
within their expertise domain. This implies that
individuals will benefit from a gradual broadening of their attentional focus toward outsidedomain tasks as they pursue and achieve domain expertise.
Through achieving a wider breadth of attention
by participating in outside domains, experts may
not only avoid cognitive entrenchment but may
also sidestep the inflexibility-related consequences of entrenchment discussed in this article. For example, in performing outside-domain
tasks, experts may retain their potential for generating radically creative ideas. This suggests a
caveat to the inverted-U-shaped relationship between domain expertise and radical idea generation posited in Proposition 6. Namely, the
slope of the drop-off in radical idea generation
associated with a high level of expertise depends on the degree to which experts focus their
attention outside their domain. This prospect
equates with Simonton’s claim that the domain
experts who are most likely to develop radically
creative ideas are not “narrow-minded persons
who concentrate all their waking hours on a
highly specialized endeavor” but, rather, those
who have wide interests across different domains (2009: 449). Moreover, and as depicted in
Figure 3, focusing attention on outside-domain
tasks may permit individuals to at least partially avoid the other inflexibility-related consequences of entrenchment discussed in this article: problem-solving fixation and adaptation
difficulty.
Building on this line of reasoning, focusing
attention on outside-domain tasks may be especially critical for those who do not typically engage in a dynamic environment within their expertise domain—the other factor posited to
attenuate the relationship between domain expertise and cognitive entrenchment. Indeed,
performing tasks in outside domains may be

591

viewed as a surrogate approach for attaining
the benefits associated with engaging in a dynamic environment that some individuals are
denied. In other words, for those operating in a
nondynamic or static environment, outsidedomain involvement represents an alternative
route to circumventing entrenchment and maintaining flexibility.
Of course, it bears noting that an expert’s
breadth of attention may conceivably become
too wide. After all, if experts spend very little
time participating in their expertise domain and
instead direct most of their attention to other
domains, their domain expertise may gradually
diminish or become obsolete. In support of this
point, research indicates that in order to maintain their expertise, individuals must continue
to devote attention to tasks associated with their
domain (Krampe & Ericsson, 1996; Sonnentag &
Kleine, 2000). Perhaps for this reason, some professional groups require members to participate
routinely in education programs that promote
knowledge acquisition and retention (e.g., continuing legal education for attorneys). In short,
while experts can avoid entrenchment by focusing attention on outside-domain tasks, those
adopting this approach should strive to allocate
enough attention to their expertise domain to
maintain their expert knowledge.
Costs versus Benefits of
Cognitive Entrenchment
In this article I explored the inflexibilityrelated consequences of cognitive entrenchment. As suggested here, inflexibility can be
problematic for experts in a variety of ways. At
the same time, it is important to note that the
consequences of entrenchment may not be negative in all circumstances. Indeed, in some situations inflexibility may prove benign or even
useful. It is therefore worth considering the conditions under which the consequences of entrenchment are most costly and the conditions
under which these consequences are potentially
beneficial.
The arguments I presented in this article suggest that entrenchment is particularly costly
when circumstances change such that greater
flexibility is needed. This point was made directly with regard to adaptation but may hold in
other respects as well. For instance, although
inflexibility in the area of problem solving may,

<-----Page 13----->592

Academy of Management Review

in some cases, serve experts well by consistently bringing effective solutions to mind,
changes within a domain may engender fixation effects as experts attempt to solve emergent
problems using outdated solutions. In fact, this
situation is analogous to the classic research
design used to evoke problem-solving fixation
in which the nature of the problem is altered
such that previously efficacious solutions are no
longer optimal (see Luchins, 1942). In addition,
as domains change because of internal or external pressures, the importance of radical creativity may rise (Benner & Tushman, 2003; Hill &
Rothaermel, 2003). As such, the negative impact
of cognitive entrenchment on radical creativity
may be especially costly during periods of
change and uncertainty (Nystrom & Starbuck,
1984). In contrast, entrenchment may be relatively unproblematic, or even beneficial, in domains characterized by a relatively high degree
of stability (Feltovich, Spiro, & Coulson, 1997). In
such domains entrenchment may produce functional and reliable responses to commonly encountered problems.
The costs versus benefits of cognitive entrenchment may also relate to the values and
norms associated with one’s domain. For example, in an innovative culture, radical idea generation tends to be embraced (Sutton, 2001; West
& Richter, 2008). In such a culture cognitive entrenchment is likely to be considered a significant hindrance insofar as it constrains the cognitive processes that lead to radical idea
generation. In contrast, cognitive entrenchment
may be less costly and more beneficial in organizations seeking to protect culturally normative
patterns of thinking. In these organizations cognitive entrenchment may be valued to the extent
it benefits the organization by aligning behavior
with what constitutes “appropriate” thought and
action (cf. March, 1994). A variety of contexts may
fit this mold, including network marketing organizations (Pratt, 2000) and military units
(Karsten, 1998).
Taken together, these observations suggest
that the degree to which cognitive entrenchment
is costly varies with certain features of the focal
domain (e.g., rate of change, cultural values),
and they raise the possibility that, in some settings, cognitive entrenchment is beneficial. Further developing this idea, it may be the case that
some degree of entrenchment is beneficial in
professionalized occupations such as law and

October

medicine. By their nature, professions possess a
large and somewhat esoteric body of knowledge
that makes their professional services valuable
and, in some cases, inimitable (Elliot, 1972; Levay & Waks, 2009; Pratt, Rockmann, & Kaufmann, 2006; von Nordenflycht, 2010). While the
knowledge associated with many professions
is continually evolving (e.g., new drugs are
frequently introduced in the field of medicine;
see Norman, Eva, Brooks, & Hamstra, 2006), the
evolution of knowledge within a profession
may be gradual (Robertson, Scarbrough, &
Swan, 2003)—an assumption integral to the
lengthy duration of education and training associated with several professions. For example, in spending many years training to become physicians, individuals assume that the
body of knowledge they accrue will remain
relevant in the future. Therefore, because of
the relative stability of the knowledge base
underlying many professions, there may be
certain advantages to cognitive entrenchment
in professional communities.
Additionally, except when pressures for
change are immediate and substantial, ideas
that challenge traditional practices valued
within a profession often receive little traction
(Greenwood, Suddaby, & Hinings, 2002). For example, only as a result of an extreme shortage of
lawyers did law firms consider and ultimately
adopt new employment arrangements that departed from the traditional “up-or-out” system
inherent to the legal profession (Sherer & Lee,
2002). Thus, among professional groups, radically creative ideas tend to be critiqued on normative grounds to the extent they undermine
practices that are integral to the profession’s
identity (Ferlie, Fitzgerald, Wood, & Hawkins,
2005). These claims suggest another reason that
cognitive entrenchment may be perceived as
functional within professions—namely, that as
an inhibitor of radical idea generation, entrenchment may prevent the emergence of radical ideas that could threaten venerated traditions. Moreover, because entrenchment is
unlikely to hinder the generation of incrementally creative ideas, professions may continue to
evolve through incremental advances that keep
valued practices intact.
In all, these observations point to potential
benefits of cognitive entrenchment in professional groups. However, it should be acknowledged that the net benefit of entrenchment may

<-----Page 14----->2010

Dane

differ across professions to the extent that they
vary in the stability of their knowledge bases.
More broadly, it can be concluded that cognitive
entrenchment is likely to carry benefits that
should be leveraged and costs that should be
considered as a function of the occupation or
profession in which one is employed.
Practical Implications
Turning to practical implications, perhaps the
most direct extension of the arguments offered
here is that individuals seeking to avoid entrenchment—particularly those who do not tend
to engage in a dynamic environment—should
participate in activities beyond their domain of
expertise. This prescription dovetails with a limited body of research pointing to the importance
of multidomain engagement. For example, research indicates that many successful scientists
tend to be polymaths—that is, in addition to
their scientific expertise, they have artistic, literary, or musical avocations (Root-Bernstein et
al., 2008; Root-Bernstein, Bernstein, & Garnier,
1995). In addition, evidence suggests that participating in non-work-related hobbies increases
creative problem-solving effectiveness at work
(Jaussi, Randel, & Dionne, 2007).
Although some individuals participate in multiple domains on their own initiative, managers
can play a role in helping to ensure that organizational members, particularly experts, focus
their attention in diverse ways. One approach
would be to offer paid time off to organizational
members who wish to engage in volunteer service work. This may provide individuals with
the financial freedom and time necessary to participate in tasks in a different domain. Managers could also adopt practices akin to Google’s
20 percent rule, which permits and encourages
employees to work on projects outside their job
description, and potentially outside their domain of expertise, for one day each week. While
Google may have implemented the 20 percent
rule as a motivational tool, the company may
garner additional benefits from it to the extent
this practice helps employees avoid cognitive
entrenchment as they acquire job expertise.
An additional approach relevant to multinational corporations would be to leverage expatriate assignments. Such assignments often differ significantly from standard job duties
because of sociocultural factors (Mendenhall &

593

Oddou, 1985). Thus, expatriates must focus their
attention not only on business issues within
their domain of expertise but also on cultural
matters. Doing so is likely to provide access to a
wealth of outside-domain inputs that may destabilize one’s cognitive schemas (see Leung,
Maddux, Galinsky, & Chiu, 2008, and Maddux &
Galinsky, 2009).
Finally, among individuals for whom cognitive entrenchment is an asset, engaging in a
dynamic environment and focusing attention on
outside-domain tasks may compromise the
schema stability that typically serves them well.
These individuals may benefit from seeking out
a static environment or limiting the extent to
which they direct their attention to domains beyond their area of expertise. More generally, all
individuals should consider whether and how
cognitive entrenchment either aids or inhibits
them within their domain and, insofar as possible, should strive to “manage” their level of entrenchment accordingly, given the avenues discussed in this article.
Future Research Directions
The arguments presented in this article suggest directions for future research. First, although cognitive entrenchment tends to increase with domain expertise, I maintained that
these concepts are not inherently coupled. Indeed, not only might some experts be low in
their level of entrenchment, but it is also possible that a moderately high degree of entrenchment could be found among individuals with
relatively little domain expertise. While the concept of an “entrenched novice” may seem counterintuitive, research suggests that novices can
be inflexible in certain respects. For example,
one need not be a domain expert to develop
habits (Ouellette & Wood, 1998; Wood et al.,
2002), which I argued here are outgrowths of
stable schemas. In addition, under high-stress
conditions, experts and novices alike often exhibit rigid responses (Chajut & Algom, 2003;
Easterbook, 1959; Staw, Sandelands, & Dutton,
1981). These observations suggest a need to examine if and how entrenchment can arise
among domain novices.
Next, I suggested in this article that attending
to tasks in outside domains limits cognitive entrenchment. However, I said little concerning the
degree to which one domain must differ from

<-----Page 15----->594

another to prompt this effect. Although more research is needed to determine the most relevant
dimensions on which to compare domains (cf.
Barnett & Ceci, 2002; Kaufman, 2007), domains
can be differentiated based on the knowledge,
skills, and abilities (KSAs; Motowidlo, Borman,
& Schmit, 1997; Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994)
they require. For example, a physics expert
working on a mechanical engineering task is
focusing attention on a different domain, but the
KSAs associated with these two domains are
likely to be more closely related than the KSAs
associated with performing a physics task versus a visual arts task. Researchers could examine whether the moderating role of outsidedomain participation on the relationship
between expertise and entrenchment is more
pronounced when an expert attends to another
domain that is highly distinct from his or her
expertise domain versus highly similar to it in
terms of the KSAs each domain requires.
In line with the former possibility, as the substantive difference between domains increases,
individuals may be more likely to encounter exceptions that engender doubt. For example, to
the extent that domains in the hard sciences
differ markedly from those in the arts (see Simonton, 2009), an expert scientist may perhaps
circumvent entrenchment by encountering a
number of concepts and phenomena being used
in different ways through participation in an
artistic domain. This possibility accords with
the research on polymaths noted earlier.
Alternatively, it is possible that a large substantive difference between domains renders it
less likely that individuals will encounter doubtinducing exceptions. Simply put, if two domains
are completely distinct, the core concepts, resources, or technologies associated with each
domain may be nonoverlapping. For example,
there may be very little conceptual overlap between the domains of nuclear physics and retail
sales. As such, it is not immediately clear how
working as a retail salesperson would lead an
expert nuclear physicist to question or doubt
features of his or her base of knowledge concerning nuclear physics. Given these divergent
possibilities, research is needed to determine
just how different or how similar domains must
be to fully activate the moderation effect associated with outside-domain participation posited in this article and depicted in Figure 3.

October

Finally, it bears considering what avenues beyond engaging in a dynamic environment and
participating in outside domains could attenuate the relationship between domain expertise
and cognitive entrenchment. In addressing this
issue, scholars could explore whether personality traits like openness to experience (McCrae,
1987) and cognitive styles like open-minded
thinking (Stanovich & West, 1997) might play
such a role. In addition, certain social context
factors are worth examining. For example, individuals working in teams that are high in functional background diversity (Bunderson, 2003b;
Hambrick, Cho, & Chen, 1996) may be exposed to
a wide range of knowledge held by other members of the team (Kurtzberg & Amabile, 2000 –
2001; Taylor & Greve, 2006). In interpreting this
diverse body of knowledge, team members may
be likely to encounter schema-destabilizing concepts—particularly to the extent their team engages in questioning and other practices that
promote knowledge integration (see Okhuysen
& Eisenhardt, 2002, for a discussion of such
practices).
Similarly, individuals who have a large number of weak ties in their social networks—ties
that “involve relatively infrequent interactions,
comparatively low emotional closeness, and
one-way exchanges” (Perry-Smith & Shalley,
2003: 92–93)—may have access to a wide range
of concepts and perspectives (Perry-Smith, 2006;
Perry-Smith & Shalley, 2003). This exposure to a
variety of viewpoints may help limit cognitive
entrenchment insofar as it raises doubt in the
manner described earlier. In short, research is
needed to further investigate both individual
and social factors as possible moderators of the
relationship between domain expertise and cognitive entrenchment.
Conclusion
While research suggests a trade-off between
expertise and flexibility, the arguments advanced in this article call this trade-off into
question. Specifically, I posited that inflexibility
arises most directly not from expertise but, instead, from the high degree of cognitive entrenchment that often pervades experts’ domain
schemas. Arguing that entrenchment is not an
inevitable by-product of expertise, I contended
that experts can eclipse entrenchment through
engaging in a dynamic environment and attend-

ing to outside-domain tasks. The implications of
the arguments presented here underscore the
importance of continuing to investigate the origins, nature, and impact of cognitive entrenchment across a variety of domains.
