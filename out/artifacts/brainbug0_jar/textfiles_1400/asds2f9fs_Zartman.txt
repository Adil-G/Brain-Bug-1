Common Elements in the Analysis
of the Negotiation Process
L William Z a r t m a n

Like the proverbial blind men who confronted the elephant and brought back
conflicting accounts of its salient characteristics, contemporary analysts of negotiation appear to be talking about different things under the name of the same
phenomenon. Some have even called for a search for a common understanding of
the subject so that analysis can proceed on the same epistemological track.
This article, however, suggests that a common understanding of the negotiation process has already developed and analysts are using it. The diversity that
can be found in a number of approaches--five of which are identified--merely
displays different ways of talking about the same phenomenon, and in fact even
involves the same questions and parameters presented from different angles and
under different names. There is more unity than some have suspected, and more
complementarity too, as different approaches reinforce and build on each other's analysis. However, many aspects of the process still elude this cormr~on but
multffaceted analysis. The common notion of the process has led analysts to
confront these continuing problems, but there is of course no certainty that
further answers to obdurate problems will not produce new terms of analysis
and even new notions of the whole process.
It is paradoxical and perhaps confusing that there is no single dominant
analytical approach to negotiation. The confusion arises from the presence of
many different attempts at analysis, sometimes inventing their own wheels to
carry forward their insights and sometimes crossreferencing from a number of
different analytical approaches (e.g., see cases in Zartman, 1987a and 1987b;
and Davidow, 1984). The fact that all of these are studies of great value only
confirms the analytical confusion. The paradox arises because behind this analytical diversity there lies a single phenomenon to b e analyzed. Although some

<-----Page 1----->authors have a hard time seeing the essential identity of the negotiation process
(Young, 1975), most others (including those who then focus on different subtypes for analytical purposes) start with a common definition of the phenomenon (Pruitt, 1981; Raiffa, 1982; Walton and McKersie, 1965; Ikie, 1964).
In simple terms, negotiation is a process of combining conflicting positions
into a common position, under a decision rule of unanimity, a phenomenon in
W~lich the outcome is determined bythe process (Kissinger, 1969, p. 212). The
essential dement ofprocess is important because it posits a determining dynamic,
not just an assortment of scattered actions or tactics. The challenge then becomes
one of finding the nature of that dynamic and its parameters. It is because this
challenge has not been met to universal satisfaction that there are still a number
of contending approaches to the study of the process. The same reason also
explains, in part, ~ a y there is such resistance among practitioners of the process
to adopting and applying the work of analysts to their practice.
The question still remains: If there is a single recognized phenomenon, and if
the various approaches that are employed to analyze that phenomenon are all
insightful, why is there not greater consensaas on how to explain negotiation? This
article will propose some answers to that question, but in the process it will
heighten--but also seek to remove--the paradox. The answer proposed is that
each of the analytical approaches puts forward a deterministic analysis in its most
rigorous form, but it is only useful insights, not whole theories, that are gained
when the unreal conditions of determinism are dropped. The clash between
deterministic integrity and realistic looseness keeps each analytic approach
separate from the others in trying to overcome its internal problems of analysis
rather than facing external problems of coordination. The fact that many of the
separate approaches are supported bya disciplinary basis also keeps them locked
in their internal analytical problems.
The underlying paradox is that the approaches are really more similar than
has been recognized, not only-in their study of the same phenomenon but also in
their answers to the same or similar questions in the same or similar ways, albeit
under different disciplinary labels. Exorcising these differences may permit an
economy of side movement and an increase of forward movement in the analysis
of the negotiation process.
The basic analytical question for "all approaches to answer is: How are
negotiated outcomes explained? To give generalized answers and to get away
from the idiosyncracies of history, the analyst must find dominant, operationalizable
variables that provide terms in which the answer can be given. These, in turn,
should be able to provide useful insights--indeed, even strategies of behavioral
rules--for practitioners seeking to obtain the best possible outcomes for themselves. Thus, practical forms of the same question are: How can each party deploy
its efforts to obtain an outcome favorable enough to be acceptable to itself but
attractive enough to the other party to draw it away from its own attempts at a
unilateral solution and win its acceptance of an agreement? Or (in the terms of
the dassic "Toughness Dilemma") when should a party be tough and when
should it be soft, knowing that conceding little will mean holding to its position
but decrease the chances of an agreement while conceding a lot will increase the
chances of an agreement but move it away from the positions it values? (Bartos,
1987; Lax and Sebenius, 1986; Zartman and Berman, 1982) Five different

and where the differences and similarities of the approaches lie. (For attempts to
show the differences in some or all of these schools, see Walton and McKersie,
1965; Young, 1975; Zartman, 1978 and 1987b.)

Structural Analysis
Structural analysis is based on a distribution of elements, in this case of instrumental elements or power, defined either as parties' relative positions (resource
possessions) or as the relative ability to make their options prevail ( or to counter
the other's efforts to make its options prevail [see Schelling, 1960; Wriggins,
1987; Bacharach and Lawler, 1981; Habeeb, 1987]). Structural analysis is the
most commonplace approach, and its deterministic statement that "the strongest side wins" is usually tautological and post hoc. To avoid the tautology, the
definitional identity between power structure and winning must be broken
both by using an independent measure of power and by focusing on the way in
which parties with different relative strengths achieve their outcomes. The latter
approach has received some attention in the analysis of situations of asymmetW,
where the better performance of the weaker of the two sides makes for an
interesting challenge for explanation. The explanation most often given can be
called "tactics," which generally serve to restore the structural equality of
power between the two parties (Snyder and Diesing, 1977, pp. 118-24;
Hopmann, 1978; Deutsch, 1973; Zartman, 1985; Wriggins, 1987). Various tactics
provide various prescriptions for overcoming asymmetry.
Another body of literature associated with the same approach starts with a
different structural assumption, of symmetry rather than asymmetry. This is
based on the finding that parties do best in negotiation when they are or feel
equal (Rubin and Brown, 1975, pp. 199 and 214-21) and that negotiation takes
place when parties' unilateral achievement of their goals is blocked either by the
other's veto or by their own incapabilities. Thus, some analysis has used structures
of symmetry to identify situations most propitious for negotiation, using when to
negotiate as a key to how to negotiate (Saunders, 1985; Zartman, 1985).
By these paths, by the time that structural analysis has moved away from its
initial post hoc formulation that outcomes are determined by the power positions of the parties, it has shifted toward simply tactical analysis based on a
different definition of power. Power becomes no longer a position or a possession-something a party "has"--but a way of exercising a causal relation-something one "doeg'--to bring about an outcome and not just the ability to do
so (Habeeb, 1987; see also Lasswell and Kaplan, 1950, p. 75; Simon, 1957, p. 5).
While such studies maybe termed structural because they deal with power,
that element is treated as a responsive, incidental, and situational characteristic
rather than as an element in a theory of conceptualization of the negotiation
process. This is a common problem with studies of power, and in the case of
negotiations it has produced an array of insightful, ff idiosyncratic, books of
proverbs on how parties can be brought to agreement. (Karass, 1970; Nierenberg,
1973; Fisher and UW, 1981) Their emphasis is on various angles of insight into
the negotiation process.
Despite a lack of theoretical focus or coherence, these studies do propose
ways to make a given offer appear more attractive, to induce the other party to
accept the first party's current offer, or to induce it to improve its own offer.
NegotiationJournal January 1988 33

<-----Page 3----->Whether stated or not, these tactics operate on either current offers, expectations, or outcomes to be obtained without negotiation (security points). They do
so in one of only two ways--either by altering the contingent value of current
offers relative to the other two points of comparison (expectations and security
points) or by identifying certain procedures ("fractionate" or "trade off") or
atmospherics ("trust" or "confidence") that fac~tate the basic process. All these
tactics are acts of (attempted) power, and all of them are ways to bring about
acceptance of a given offer. Furthermore, they all focus on a part of a common
and general process of replacing unilateral and conflicting positions with a
common position or outcome, whether that process is explicitly stated as such or
not. Explicit statements about the nature of the process should be useful and
would facilitate links between approaches; but even in the absence of such
statements, it is clear that the process is the same.

Strategic Analysis
Strategic analysis is also based on an array of elements, but its structure is one of
ends, not means. Strategic analysis, as portrayed in game theoretic matrices,
begins with the assumption that outcomes are determined by the relative array of
their values to the parties, under conditions of rational (i.e., preferred) choice.
The standard strategic models--Prisoner's Dilemma Game and Chicken Dilemma
Game--are syrmnetrical, and therefore incorporate the same assumption of
equality as often found in structural analysis. It has frequently been noted that
game theory excludes any use of power as a result of its rigorous analytical forms
and its clear logic of determinism; rather, it records values as given and shows the
strategies that will be chosen and the consequences of doing so (Young, 1975;
Axelrod, 1984).
As a result, some observers assert that strategic analysis is of real value only
in comparing the decision to negotiate with the decision to hold out, a comparison parallel to the insights gained from an analysis of symmetrical structures.
Since game theory values are given (and indeed, at worst, sometimes inferred
from the strategies adopted), there is no way to fractionate or trade off; all that
can be done is to enter the value of any such external operations into the
appropriate box in the matrix. Likewise, there is no way to change any of those
values within the matrix; the only option is to record any changes from one
matrix to another.
Yet when the rigorous assumptions that provide the basis for its determinism are relaxed and game theory presentations are used heuristically as the
starting point for analysis, a number of the associated limitations fall away and
new possibilities appear. Strategic analysis shows that the onlyway to break out of
deadlock is through asymmetry. Therefore, instead ofworldng to improve offers
of cooperation (CC)--absolutely or in relation to expectations which cannot be
shown on a matrix--parties are best advised to alter the payoffs or perceptions of
payoffs associated with nonnegotiated or unilateral outcomes (DD). This, in
turn, brings in new understandings of power, seen as the use of security points to
induce or resist changes in bargaining positions (Snyder and Diesing, 1977;
Zagare, 1978; Brains, 1985).
Movement is the essence of the negotiation process, and movement cannot
be shown on a matrix. But the conditions that produce movement--again,
different evaluations of outcomes as the source of power--can be shown on a

The result is the same process as indicated in the relaxation and refinement of
structm~al analysis, in which parties mo~e from their unilateral options to a
common cooperative decision so shaped as to be more attractive than their
security points.
The problem with strategic analysis at present is not its rigidity but its
limited scope. Many of the important and more detailed questions on how to
move parties toward a common solution lie outside the analysis; even such
important insights as the ways to reinforce commitment (Schelling, 1960;
Baldwin, 1987) are triggered by a need to consider security points but are outside game theoretic analysis. An effort to render more precise the importance of
the security point in comparison to unilateral demands and multilateral compromise is an important new advance of the strategic approach, but the calculation to Critical Risk depends on the difficult shift from. ordinal to cardinal
values in the matrix (Etlsberg, 1975; Snyder and Diesing, 1977).
On the other hand, strategic categories of encounters can help answer some
of the puzzling analytical questions of negotiations. For example, the Toughness
Dilemma may be resolved by use of the two game theory dilemmas: Whereas
parties who see their situation as a Prisoner's Dilemma Game may do best by
playing soft to open and tough to punish (Axelrod, i984), parties who see
themselves in a Ct~cken Dilemma Game do better by playing tough to demand
and soft to reward (Nyerges, 1987). This, in turn, confirms an answer from
structural analysis to the Toughness Dilemma, based on appropriate tactics for
strong and weak powers, respectively. Further examples could be produced
where strategic analysis, despite apparent limitations, ends up discussing elements of the same process, and often the same process problems, as other
approaches but in different terms.
Process Analysis
Process analysis has the common feature of explaining outcomes through a series
of concessions determined by some element inherent in each party's position.
The particular element varies slightly according to the particular version of the
theory; most process analysis is based on a security point theory in some form,
although a few other variations are also used. Process analysis indicates that the
party will concede on the basis of a comparative calculation of its own versus its
opponents costs or of its own costs versus some acceptability level (Zeuthen,
1975; Cross, 1969; Pen, 1975; Hicks, 1932; Snyder and Diesing, 1977). On this
basis, one can determine which party will concede how much until the final
point of convergence is reached. This is, of course, a way of diagramming a
negotiation process that is the same as that discussed by other approaches.
Other variations are end point theories and concession rate theories, both of
which are parts of the same process. The first determines the parties' movement
so as to assure a mutuallyfair and maximizing outcome; the second--concession
rate theories--determines the parties' movement on the basis of reactions to
each other's degree of concession (Bartos, 1978; Zeuthen, 1975; Nash, 1975;
Cross, 1969, 1978; cf., Prnitt, 1981). These latter variations (endpoint and
concession-rate theories of process) are onlyprescriptivelydeterministic; that is,
they indicate how parties will act and where they will end up if they want to
reach a mutually fair and maximizing outcome, and thus they are not good desNego#atioJ~Jourrtat January 1988 35

<-----Page 5----->criptions of the process. But they do serve the useful function of providing a
baseline against which unfairness and power can be measured; hence, they are
relevant to some understanding of the process (Pillar, 1983).
Process theories, which originate in economics, are in fact structural theories which indicate that the weaker party will concede until the tables are
turned, at which point the other party will concede in its turn, and so on
to agreement. Hence, they are theories of power, with power measured in terms
of a comparison between offers and security points or, in other words, in terms
of critical risk factors. Although this is never done in these theories, to the
extent that parties can alter each other's or their own security points, they can
exercise power as well as simply possess it; this therefore reduces the deterministic possibilities of the theory but increases its reality The similaritybetween
process and strategic theories has long been recog~zed (Harsanyi, 1956 and
1977; Wagner, 1975) although their mechanisms are indeed different. The
similarity with structural theories should also be registered; although marly
structuralists would probably not "read" game theory- or "talk" bilateral monopoly, their analyses are complementary, covering the same phenomena within
the same process.
The neatness of processes theory only works in idealized situations, and
then only with idiosyncracies (Khury, 1968; Bartos, 1974, 1987; Hamermesch,
1987). Concession behavior does not always match; often it mismatches or
non-matches or tracks (Pruitt, 1981), and parties do not even concede responsively. Rather, they try to teach and learn, respond and elicit responses, all at the
same time, combining several types of behavior that make theoretically neat
patterns unrealistic (Coddington, 1968; Cross, 1969; Bartos, 1987). The point
here is that in the process, analysts are discerning both involuntaryand voluntary,
mechanical and manipulati~e, process and power elements that make up negotiation, all of them clustered about a similarly understood effort to combine
conflicting positions into a common one. As the references in this review are
begimaing to show; analysts do not even belong exclusively to one school or
another but sometimes borrow naturally from different approaches. Yet the fact
that the field is seen as pluralistic as it is, or that bibliographies remain largely in
the author's discipline (Rubin and Brown, 1975) means that there is not enough
natural borrowing and crossreferencing.
Behavioral Analysis
Behavioral analysis provides an obviously different explanation of negotiated
outcomes by using the negotiators themselves as die focus of analysis (JOnsson,
1978). The terms of analysis used are the personalities of the negotiators, either
directly or in interaction. Personality in social psychology can be used to refer to
personal predispositions that exist at a number of different levels, from biologicallyingrained needs to more influenceable attitudes. At whatever level, this school of
analysis responds to a common belief about negotiation--that "it all depends on
the personalities of the negotiators." The challenge then becomes to translate
that popular perception into identifiable and nontautological variables that can
be used for analysis.
A more literary and intuitive basis for behavioral analysis began with Nicotson's (1939) distinction between Shopkeepers and Warriors. It has been extended
and developed through a number of forms into Snyder and Diesing's (1977)
36 L William Zart,m4n Coranu~n Elements

<-----Page 6----->Sofdiners and Hardliners. There are many characterizations possible for these
basic types, but some can be given in terms already used by other schools: The
Hardline Warrior sees situations as a Prisoner's Dilemma Game and acts as a
mismatcher, expecting toughness to lead to softness (and his victory) and
softness to lead to a toughness (and his defeat); on the other hand, the Sofffine
Shopkeeper sees situations as a Chicken Dilemma Game and follows matching
behavior, expecting toughness to lead to toughness (and deadlock) and softness
to lead to softness (and agreement). Thus, behavioral analyses take up the same
parameters as elements in the same process as other approaches, combining
them into typologies equated with the behaver rather than leaving them independent as behaviors.
A more develooed approach involves categorizing personality types according to their Interpersonal Orientation (IO), an approach that is both more
insightful and more complex because it is not merely dichotomons and because
its effects depend on interaction rather than on simple or direct taxonomic
associations. Opposed to a Low IO type are two types of High IOs--Cooperators
and Competitors. Either produces a positive result when negotiating with the
same type of personality but, when cross-paired, the match is unproductive
because the two types grate on each other. Rather than explaining an outcome in
its own terms, as the previous typologies tend to do, IO analysis operates on the
basis of a causal interaction (Rubin and Brown, 1975). It also identifies different
types of outcomes, depending on joint or comparative maximization, a point also
developed in studies of Motivational Orientations (Rubin and Brown, 1975;
Filley, 1975 ). But this approach too deals with such elements as the propensity to
compromise, to construct positive- or divide zero-sum outcomes, or to adopt a
tough or soft line (i.e., a flatter or steeper concession rate) during the process of
combining conflicting positions into a joint decision.

Integrative Analysis
Integrative analysis, like behavioral analysis, would seem to constitute an exception to the general understanding of a negotiation process. Although it too
conceives of negotiation as a process, its process runs through stages, in which
the outcome is explained by the performance of behaviors identffied as specifically appropriate to each successive stage (Gulliver, 1979; Saunders, 1985; Zartman
and Berman, 1982; Zartman, 1987a; Druckman, 1986).
Rather than seeing a process that w-orks from fixed points of discord to a
common point of convergence, integrative analysis emphasizes the imprecision
of parties' interests in their own minds. Integrative analysis stresses the need to
manipulate conceptualizations of the problem into mutually satisfying positivesum outcomes before proceeding to an elaboration of a detailed division of the
spoils. By extending its concept of the negotiation process back before the time
~ a e n positions appear as fixed points, integrative analysis not only allows for
greater and more positive maniptflation of those positions (Fisher and Ury, 1981)
but also meets practitioners' understanding of negotiation by drawing attention
to the prenegotiation part of the process (Bendahmane and McDonald, 1984 and
1986; Zartman, 1987b).
But again, these positive aspects of the approach should not obscure the fact
that the subject is the same process as analyzed elsewhere. "lthe integrative
analyst's emphasis on opening options is preliminary to a focus on closure, using
NegoOationJournal January 1988 37

<-----Page 7----->expanded possibilities of mutual benefit to buy agreement to an outcome that is
less---or at least different than the original demands. The same process can be
described as giving something to get something, a process of establishing terms
oftrade for an exchange ofitems in the absence offixed prices and even of fixed
monetary- units. Using terms mentioned earlier, integrative analysis explores the
mechanics of the Shopkeeper confronted with ~rarrior aspects of the problem
and with the need to get around those Warrior aspects. Negotiators--at least
diplomatic negotiators and probably most others---are not merely Shopkeepers
~aho can make a deal on any issue. There are, after all, items that are better
postponed, interests that are properly nonnegotiable, and limits to acceptable
deals that are imposed by security points. If finding a common agreement
through this maze is more than a matter of corwergence, it is a matter of
convergence as well.
A growing branch of this analysis focuses on precise mechanisms for identifying the best possible deal that each party can obtain, given the differences in
the nature of their interests. While this is a complex extension of the Nash
(1975) solution that occupies a basic position in the strategic and process
approaches, the complexity of stakes makes a simple positive-sum outcome too
schematic to be useful (Valavanis, 1958; Ikle and Leites, 1962; Barclay and
Peterson, 1976; Raiffa, 1982; Sebenius, 1984). The process involves finding as
many dimensions of components to the parties' interests as possible in order to
provide the best tradeoffs, and thereby insure the greatest durability to the
outcome. In addition to finding how much of a conflicting position a party must
give up to gain assent, the process also involves finding how much of a non- (or
less-) valued position a party can trade to gain a more valued position (Homans,
1961, p. 62). But the element of conflict is never absent, and the process of
shaping a single multilateral derision out of conflicting unilateral claims remains.

An Agenda of Unanswered Questions
It should be clear that the study of negotiation has come a considerable way in
the past two decades in building and expanding on a common concept of a
process. The study today involves far more than the rather loose characterization
given in the International Encyclopedia o f the Social Sciences (Ikle, 1968) that
nego ationwasa formofmteractionthroughwhich(partles), trytoarrange...
a new combination of some of their common and conflicting interests." The
"form of interaction" has taken shape as a process of combining conflicting
positions into a common outcome by joint decision, allowing more specific focus
of attention on how this done, whether by power, by patterns of mo~ement, by"
restructuring stakes and values, by interacting personality types, or by a series of
steps. Yet, just as dearly, there is much more to do to know the process, although
many of those further directions are indicated by using the common concept of
process as a starting point.
One problem raised by the notion of negotiation as a process is that of
measuring success, an answer to which is necessary to an evaluation of behavior
and prescriptions for its improvement. The question of success is more complex
than it may appear (Zartman, 1987a). The nature of negotiation is to arrive at the
largest mutually satisfactory agreement with any one (and therefore, each)
getting at least enough to make it want to keep the agreement. By that very
nature, negotiation is not a process of winning and losing so that success must be
3~

<-----Page 8----->evaluated against the problem, not against the adversary. (However, there is a
subcategory of negotiations in which one party's aims are to deny the adversary a
particular payoff rather than to get as much as possible for itself, making a
positive-sum evaluation more complex.) A number of criteria are potentially
relevant for the evaluation of success, none of which gives a completely satisfactory answer.
First, signature of an agreement is a prima fade or nominal sign of success
because it indicates a judgment by the parties that they expect to be better off
w~ith the agreement than without it, and that they can do no better by either
continuing negotiations or choosing an alternative outcome. Second, this perception can be verified empirically to see if the parties are indeed better off,
either by comparing their condition before and after the agreement or by
comparing their position after the agreement with their presumed position at the
same time in the absence of an agreement (a more relevent comparison, but a
counteffactual one that involves some judgment [Sebenius, 1984, p.72-73]).
While nothing says that the parties must be equallywell offor even equally better
off, further evaluations could also investigate how unequally better oR" the
agreement made them and also whether they were Pareto-optimaUy better
off--that is, whether they had missed opportunities to improve the condition of
either of them without making the other less well off. Since some negotiations
may be designed to redress power inequities while others may reflect power
inequities, the criteria of success based on the relative improvement of the
parties' postions will vary. Third, the results can be evaluated against the partieg
openingpositions, with all the caveats about the initial vagueness and inflation of
demands that is inherent in the process. Nash solutions and Bartos solutions-discussed under end-point determinism--are a function of opening positions,
and can serve as a baseline to evaluate actual outcomes. Despite the fact that they
are commonly used, all three of these criteria for evaluation have flaws and
complexities that call for further work--there is presently very little--on
systems of evaluation.
Another topic of concern is the analysis of negotiations in the case of the
three very different types of stakes--those solvable by division, those by creation,
and those by exchange. Although much of the earlier literature on negotiation
focused on the more obvious topic of divisio n (Schopenhauer, 1896; Nicolson,
1939; Schelling, 1960) with its notion of negotiation as winning or losing, much
more attention lately has been drawn to the improvement of exchanges (Homans,
1961; Axetrod, 1970; Nash, 1975; Sebenius, 1984; Zartman, 1987a) with its
notion of mutual satisfactions.
The importance of resolv~mgproblems by exchange bears much emphasis
because patties in conflict often forget that resolution by multilateral decisions
means "buying" the other party's agreement through inducements in terms of
items that part}" values, in order to make agreement attractive to itself. At the
same time, emphasis on exchange carries a different image of negotiation from an
encounter of conceding and winning, portraying instead a positive-sum process
where "everyone wins" (something). Unfortunately, this is not the whole picture.
Just as there must be a ltttle Warrior in every successful Shopkeeper, so there is
inevitably some zero-sum aspect to every positive-sum. Once parties have created a greater good, there is some need to decide how to divide and share it.
Furthermore, there are some stakes that are indivisible and others that are
NegotiationJournal January 1988 39

<-----Page 9----->unexchangeable. These aspects of negotiation are still not the subject of exhaustive or definitive treatment, and they are somewhat different from the earlier,
insightful analysis of redistributive bargaining (Walton and McKersie, 1965).
To date, there are three ways of thinking about the problem of division. First
is to replace it in the context of exchange by means of compensation. By
determining what the item is worth, the other party can counterbalance it
through compensatory concessions. Unfortunately, some stakes have an absolute
or infinite worth, so that no compensation is possible. Second is to restructure
perceptions of the stakes so that things are seen differently and the zero.sum
nature of the outcomes is removed. Again, some stakes escape such creative
reformulation or, even when subject of an attractive formula, they prove intractable in detail. Third is to manipulate notions of justice which can then be
translated to the specific, an idea akin to the previous notion of a creative
formula. But that merely intellectualizes the problem without solving it in many
cases, since it is the conflicting notions of justice that make the problems of
divisions so intractable in the first place. Obviously, practitioners need more help
in ways of dealing with the zero-sum aspects of negotiation--the "Jerusalem
Problems"--that lie beyond positive-sum creativity.
A third topic of continuing inquiry highlighted by the generally accepted
notion of the negotiation process is the Toughness Dilemma. The question of
when to be tough and when to be soft, and the paradox on which it is based, has
already been identified as the major tactical question for analysts and practitioners alike. By now, it is plain that there is no way out of the dilemma as presented,
and that correct and insightful answers depend on some intermediate variable,
such as personality, timing, phase, power, etc. But there is still no sense of any
hierarchy among these intermediate variables---other than the eternal debates
among disciplines as to which gives the best analysis--and no notions as to which
are trumps. Somewhere between the anecdotal proverbs and the unoperationalizable theory lies a not-yet-fully mined terrain of inquiry which may require
new parameters.
Finally, an area of negotiation that falls outside the current paradigm is
multilateral bargaining. The current process notion has thus far worked to
exclude effective consideration of multilateral negotiation, and those that have
been treated well tend to be reduced to bilateral analysis (Lipson, 1985, p. 220).
When not reduced to dyads, multilateral negotiation tends to be treated merely
descriptively even if insightftdly, a problem that has posed particular challenges
in regard to the successive GATT rounds (Preeg, 1970; Evans, 1971; Cline et al.,
1978; Winham, 1987). There have been a number of excellent attempts to devise
an approach to multilateral negotiations (that is, a large number of participants,
not merely more than two, as in Raiffa, 1982; Zagare, 1978) which indicate some
promising directions (Zartman, 1987c).
One set of approaches treats multilateral negotiations as a problem in
coalition-formation (Rubin and Brown, 1975, pp. 64 ft.; Snyder and Diesing,
1977, pp. 349 ft.; Raiffa, 1982). However, coalition is a very different process from
negotiation. And, to the extent that coalition covers the shaping of outcomes to
be decided up or down by some sort ofweighted decision rule, it hides a separate
negotiation process. There is something going on in the interstices of coalition
that needs a separate analysis that is not yet available. Like the strategic approach
to bilateral negotiations, to which it is related, coalition analyzes what happens

Secondly, preferences and scaling have been used in some different and
imaginative ways (Sebenius, 1984; Friedheim, 1987; Hipel and Fraser, 1984). But
they too indicate ingredients to an agreement rather than the process bywhich it
is obtained; as in coalition, negotiation becomes voting or at least approaches it.
Other approaches are conceivable but have not b e e n used--small group dynamics might provide a new analytical context, as might a conceptual examination of
the construction of an agreement out of individual pieces.
In multilateral negotiation as in the predominant bilateral mode, the two
categories of ingredients are parties and stakes. Negotiated agreements are made
of stakes by parties. Bilateral negotiation has its general process model as a basis
for analysis that permits many approaches to coexist and reinforce each other.
Multilateral negotiation needs either to fit into that concept of process or invent
its own basic model to enjoy the same benefits. In any case, in regard to bilateral
negotiation, there are many blind men but only one elephant, and the two should
not be confused with each other.

Systems Analysis, 18-22 May 1987, Laxenburg, Austria.
