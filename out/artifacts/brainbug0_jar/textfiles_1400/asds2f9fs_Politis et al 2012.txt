The past decade has seen a plethora of policy initiatives that seek to bridge the
chasm between investments in public R&D and its eﬀective diﬀusion in society.
This article uses a case study approach to explore and contrast the eﬀectiveness of
diﬀerent entrepreneur models in ﬁnancing and developing university spin-oﬀs
(USOs). The distinction between diﬀerent entrepreneur models is based on
whether the USOs are championed by university employees that seek to
commercialize their own inventions or by external entrepreneurs who are not
the original inventors but with acquired rights to develop and commercialize
technology originating from university research. Our analysis show that external
entrepreneurs have a diﬀerent mind-set that makes them better equipped to deal
with opportunities and obstacles related to ﬁnancing and developing USOs.
However, the development paths of USOs are embedded in a more complex web
of path-dependent interactions, where the championship of the USO becomes
interwoven with existing and emerging social relationships and opportunities, and
challenges related to the technology that is commercialized.

Introduction
The transfer and commercialization of technology originating from university research
have been increasingly acknowledged among scholars as an important source of
innovations that foster regional development and economic growth (Rasmussen,
Moen, and Gulbrandsen 2006; Wright et al. 2007). These acknowledgements have also
made policy-makers increasingly aware of the role of universities as potential engines
for innovation and job creation, and the need for developing well-functioning support
infrastructures for technology commercialization. Accompanying this interest has been
vivid academic debates about the existence of a funding gap as a main barrier for
developing university-generated knowledge into practical applications, in particular,
the diﬃculty for potential entrepreneurs residing within the university system to cover
costs related to early-stage innovation and commercialization of public R&D
(Widding, Mathisen, and Madsen 2009).
A popular route to commercialize university-generated knowledge has been
through the formation of university spin-oﬀs (USOs), which is deﬁned in this

article as a new venture initiated in a university setting and based on the
technology developed at a university (Shane 2004; Rasmussen and Borch 2010;
Rasmussen 2011). The increased attention to this entrepreneurial mode of
technology transfer has brought with it a better understanding of the funding gap
related to new ventures that operate in the very technology forefront (Ortin-Angel
and Vendrell-Herrero 2010). The lack of current or short-term future earnings
and the negative cash ﬂows that typically characterize these technology-intensive
ﬁrms implies a high level of uncertainty regarding their probability of success,
which also explains why USOs experience diﬃculties in raising ﬁnancing in their
early stages of development.
However, the general limited insights into the wide variety of diﬀerent types of
USOs that exist (for an excellent review, see Mustar et al. 2006) have resulted in an
unfortunate tendency to treat them as largely homogeneous entities. In fact, the
stylized conception of USOs that dominate in policy discussions are ﬁrms
championed by university employees who seek to commercialize their own
inventions. From this follows the assumption that the academic entrepreneurs are
largely dependent on a well-functioning and integrative support infrastructure for
ﬁnancing and developing their USOs. In parallel with this stylized conception, the
focus in academic studies addressing early-stage ﬁnance in relation to the
development of USOs has primarily been on investigating its supply, where a range
of sources available has been explored, such as banks, business angels and venture
capitalists (i.e. Wright, Vohora, and Lockett 2004; Wright et al. 2006; Knockaert,
Clarysse, and Wright 2010).
In contrast to the ‘inventor-entrepreneur model’, however, a small stream of
studies has emphasized the need to recognize an alternative model in the
commercialization of university-generated knowledge (Radosevich 1995; Franklin,
Wright, and Lockett 2001; Lindholm Dahlstrand 2008). This alternative model is
characterized by the USOs championed by ‘external entrepreneurs’, i.e. entrepreneurs who are not the original academic inventors but who, for various reasons, have
acquired rights to develop the technology. Preliminary empirical evidence suggests
that the ‘external-entrepreneur model’ is a highly potent but also largely an
unutilized mechanism in the commercialization of university-generated knowledge
(Franklin, Wright, and Lockett 2001; Nicolaou and Birley 2003; Leitch and Harrison
2005). External entrepreneurs are, for example, expected to be less dependent on a
well-functioning support infrastructure for ﬁnancing and developing USOs as they
have easier access to risk capital and strategic alliances due to more extensive
industry experience and business knowledge. However, the evidence of such beneﬁts
is at best scarce, in some cases even close to anecdotal, and there is, thus, a need for
more systematic research eﬀorts to explore the eﬀectiveness of this technology
transfer mechanism.
The overall research question driving this study is how USOs championed by
external entrepreneurs deal with challenges and problems related to ﬁnancing and
developing the new venture. This question is motivated by the observed gap in our
knowledge of how the external-entrepreneur model may inﬂuence the development
and performance of ventures that are initiated in a university setting and based on
the technology developed at a university (Lindholm Dahlstrand 2008). Given the
current state of this ﬁeld of research, we employ a case study approach to explore
and contrast USOs championed by external entrepreneurs against when university
employees seek to commercialize their own inventions.

The main contribution of our study is twofold. First, our analysis shows that
external entrepreneurs have a diﬀerent mind-set that makes them better equipped
to deal with opportunities and obstacles related to ﬁnancing and developing
USOs. This ﬁnding supports the general idea addressed in literature and research
on academic entrepreneurship of diﬀerentiating USOs based on whether the ﬁrm
is championed by inventor entrepreneurs or external entrepreneurs (e.g.
Radosevich 1995; Franklin, Wright, and Lockett 2001). Second, our case evidence
also shows that the consequences of this diﬀerent mind-set for the ﬁnancing and
development of USOs are relatively minor. Rather, the development paths of
USOs seem to be embedded in a more complex web of path-dependent
interactions where the championship of the USO becomes interwoven both
with relationships among co-founders and other close associates in the venture
team as well as opportunities and challenges related to the technology that is
being commercialized. In all, our ﬁndings suggest that the external entrepreneurs
can play a key role in orchestrating public eﬀorts to promote the commercialization of university-generated knowledge but they also call for caution and further
scholarly inquiry before adopting stereotypical entrepreneur models to fuel the
development of USOs.
The rest of the article is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide
a literature review, where we discuss and demarcate our area of interest and
deﬁne our key concepts. Thereafter follows the method section, where we present
the details of our case study approach and the case studies that were undertaken.
This is followed by a presentation of the results from the analysis together with a
discussion of our ﬁndings in relation to the current state of the research ﬁeld. The
article ends with a concluding section with implications for theory and public
policy.
Literature review
Increased attention among policy-makers for the need to support the commercialization of university-generated knowledge has led to eﬀorts aimed at developing
USOs in several post-industrialized countries. USOs have in this respect been found
to share features that make them highly interesting as targets for public policy. For
example, empirical evidence from the US suggests that the USOs are growth
oriented, with high survival rates and with high likelihood of attracting venture
capital compared to the average start-up (Shane 2004). There is also a tendency
among USOs to locate close to the parent university, which means that their
economic beneﬁts in terms of job creation and taxable wealth accrue locally
(Steﬀenson, Rogers, and Speakman 2000). Moreover, successful USOs can lead to
enhanced faculty and university reputations, and may even provide employment for
university graduates (Feldman et al. 2002). This local appropriation of wealth can be
compared to when public R&D are licensed to larger corporations where potential
beneﬁts often are transferred out of the immediate local region, and sometimes even
out of the country (Radosevich 1995). Thus, given their growth potential and
economic beneﬁts, policy-makers have taken measures to support the commercialization of university-generated knowledge by building up support infrastructures for
ﬁnancing and developing USOs. Such policy eﬀorts include initiatives to create
business angel networks and regional venture capital funds (Doran and Bannock
2000; Collewaert, Manigart, and Aernoudt 2010) as well as providing publicly

ﬁnanced soft loans1 and grants (including competition prizes) directly to technologyintensive start-ups (Klofsten, Jonsson, and Simón 1998).
Development of USOs and early-stage ﬁnance
There are diﬀerent models describing how the early ﬁnancial needs of a growing
technology-intensive ﬁrm develop and move through various phases. Two
commonalities, however, are shared among most of these models. The ﬁrst is that
they often distinguish between the seed phase, the start-up phase and the early
growth phase (e.g. Roberts 1991; Brophy 1997; Lindström and Olofsson 2001). The
second is an underlying assumption that each of these stages in a ﬁrm’s development
is followed by changes in its ﬁnancial structure and access to ﬁnance.
The seed phase is generally characterized by an intensive period of research and
development before any formal organization has come into existence. In this phase,
ﬁnance is needed to support research activities and to assess and develop an initial
business concept. This ﬁnancing is generally provided from own funds and/or from
public sources (Cooper 1986; Moore 1994). Moreover, the team of researchers
involved in this phase are often heavily involved in bootstrapping ﬁnance aimed at
securing the equipment and competence needed to develop the project at below
market price (i.e. Winborg 2009), such as using research grants, developing product
at nights/weekends and using public domain development tools. The start-up phase is
characterized by early organizing eﬀorts where the ﬁrm is registered and becomes a
legal entity. The emerging organization is typically championed by one of the
founders who may become engaged full-time, often with the support of his or her
closest associates. Financing in this phase of development is generally needed to
support initial product development and exploring the market. Oftentimes personal
funds are exhausted and the ﬁrm needs to look elsewhere for further funding. The
reliance on bootstrapping ﬁnance to develop the project may remain relatively
strong. However, the growing need to invest in technological assets and cover costs
related to product development increases the attention to other more ‘traditional’
ways of ﬁnancing the USO, such as publicly ﬁnanced soft loans (see note 1) and
grants (including competition prizes) directly targeted to technology-intensive startups (Klofsten, Jonsson, and Simón 1998), as well as private investors, such as
business angels and venture capitalists (Hogan and Hutson 2008). In the following
early growth phase, a more formal organization is developing and the new venture
typically championed by the founder or a professional manager. The ﬁnance in this
phase is generally needed to initiate or scale up manufacturing eﬀorts and to boost
sales (Oakey 2003). As USOs will not typically be generating proﬁt at this point, they
are often required to go through several subsequent rounds of raising ﬁnancial
resources before they can start selling their product on a larger scale and reaping any
sustainable economic returns.
The role of the new venture champion for ﬁnancing and developing USOs
When starting up a new technology intensive ﬁrm, there is a need for someone to
take the role as new venture champion to coordinate and manage the diﬀerent inputs
of skills, resources and entrepreneurial capacity according to the planned
development of the ﬁrm (Olofsson and Wahlbin 1984; Klofsten et al. 1988; Vohora,
Wright, and Lockett 2004). Clarysse and Moray (2004) even argue that this role is

<-----Page 5----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

179

absolutely vital for the future development of a project. The important role of the
new venture champion is especially evident when it comes to accessing ﬁnancial
resources (Klofsten et al. 1988; Carlsson 2002; Baum and Silverman 2004). For
example, USOs have little or no track record and they often lack tangible assets that
may be used as collateral which limit the possibility to receive favourable bank loans.
Moreover, it is very diﬃcult for potential investors to value new scientiﬁc ideas when
commercial applications are largely untested (Lindström and Olofsson 2001). Hence,
severe information asymmetries exist between champions of USOs and external
stakeholders who may be interested in ﬁnancing the business (Levie and Gimmon
2008). USOs thus require access to both ﬁnancial resources as well as a capacity to
access and use appropriate sources of ﬁnance in line with the development of the new
venture project (Olofsson and Wahlbin 1984; Klofsten et al. 1988; Vohora, Wright,
and Lockett 2004).
Interestingly, empirical studies suggest that USOs may vary considerably in their
capacity to ﬁnance and develop the ﬂedgling business depending on who becomes
involved in championing the new venture (Daniels and Hofer 1993; Clarysse and
Moray 2004). For example, empirical evidence suggest that academic inventors
without suﬃcient training and commercial experience, while competent as initial
technology champions, often are not well suited to the founder role needed to drive
the new venture forward (Daniels and Hofer 1993; Clarysse and Moray 2004).
Moreover, the use of ﬁnancial sources are, for example, shaped by entrepreneurs’
prior knowledge of running a business, as well as by the ability to exploit existing
social ties with other individuals and organizations (Landström and Winborg 1995;
Shane and Cable 2002). Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the type of
entrepreneur can have an eﬀect on the ventures they are managing, which in turn will
inﬂuence the subsequent development of USOs.
In this study, we seek to create a better understanding of how the externalentrepreneur model may inﬂuence the ﬁnancing and subsequent development of
USOs. This conceptualization is based on the original conceptualization made by
Radosevich (1995), suggesting a classiﬁcation of new venture champions of USOs
into two main types based on their relation to the technology and the university. The
ﬁrst type is represented by the inventor-entrepreneur model. Here the entrepreneur,
who is also the original inventor, is spinning oﬀ a new venture from his or her parent
organization. According to Radosevich (1995), this model represents the traditional
method of technology transfer from public research institutes to the private sector.
In a similar vein, Franklin, Wright, and Lockett (2001, 128) characterize this type of
new venture champion as an individual who is the technology originator but who
also assumes the role of the entrepreneur. They also point out that the academic may
leave the university to run the company, or may alternatively run the company in
parallel with his/her academic responsibilities. In all, the strength of this model is the
presence of the original inventor who has an in-depth understanding of the
technology and the tacit knowledge that often underlies the invention (McQueen and
Wallmark 1984; Wright, Vohora, and Lockett 2004). However, it is also evident that
the academic researchers, in general, have inadequate commercial awareness and
limited experience in how to continue the new venture creation process (Vohora,
Wright, and Lockett 2004), which can inﬂuence their ﬁnancial preferences.
The second type of new venture champion suggested by Radosevich (1995) is
represented by the external-entrepreneur model. In this case, the original inventor
chooses to provide the rights to commercialize the technology to an external

<-----Page 6----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

entrepreneur who is an outsider in respect to the invention but who will take the
active role in championing the new venture. This does not mean that the original
inventor completely disappear from the scene, however, they become more or less
passive shareholders and/or members of the scientiﬁc advisory board and thus
remain in their academics career (Nicolaou and Birley 2003; Clarysse and Moray
2004). Franklin, Wright, and Lockett (2001, 129) deﬁne external entrepreneur as
an independent individual (or organization) who comes from outside the
university, while the original inventor maintains his or her position at the
university. The strength of this model is the more extensive commercial experience
of the external entrepreneur, often including both technical and managerial
expertises, and which thus is likely to inﬂuence the awareness and understanding
of various sources of ﬁnance necessary for commercializing the project. This
diﬀers from the experience of inventor entrepreneurs that may have an extensive
understanding of the technology but who often have limited commercial
experience. A description of the external-entrepreneur model in contrast to the
inventor-entrepreneur model based on our theoretical discussion is presented in
Table 1.
Table 1 provides a summated overview of the expected strengths and
weaknesses of the two diﬀerent entrepreneur models in the commercialization
of university-generated knowledge, but at a fairly abstract level. Hence, at the
current level of theorizing the two diﬀerent entrepreneur models presented above
primarily represent ideal types or ideal-typical categories (Weber 1947). Such ideal
types are generally intended to provide a blueprint or an abstract model so that
deviation from the extreme can be noted, studied and explained (Doty and Glick
1994). Hence, the categorization can be used to guide empirical studies and to
derive conjectures and theoretical statements that in turn can be subject to
rigorous empirical testing.
In the rest of the article, we will continue to explore the eﬀectiveness of the
external-entrepreneur model for ﬁnancing and developing USOs. Given the current

state of the ﬁeld, and in line with our interest in contributing with development at
both theoretical and empirical levels, we will employ a case study research design.
This approach will allow us to collect and analyse qualitative in-depth empirical data
aimed to enrich and provide detail to the current ideal-typical way of categorizing
external entrepreneurs, which in turn allow for further elaboration and creation of
theory and hypotheses on the topic.
Context and methodology

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

The Swedish context in brief
The empirical study is conducted in Sweden, which provides a certain context for
technology-intensive entrepreneurship in general, and the start-up of USOs in
particular that deserves to be mentioned. First of all, Sweden is a small country of
about 9 million people but with a skilled and highly educated workforce and a large
higher education sector. Compared to other countries, Sweden has, relative to its
population, a high number of science and engineering graduates, high levels of public
and private R&D expenditure and high patent rates. Moreover, the private sector
has a strong international orientation and a high degree of internationalization, and
the Swedish economy has during the past decade been largely driven by deregulation,
globalization and growth in technology sectors.
The Swedish innovation system is characterized by highly developed research
structures and strong regional and international technological cooperation. Sweden
also has a rather unique regime governing intellectual property originating from
universities. Unlike many other European countries, Sweden has kept the law that
allows university researchers to retain full rights to their scientiﬁc discoveries. Thus, the
academic inventors have full discretion about the desired mode of knowledge
dissemination but they also have to bear all costs for commercialization eﬀorts.
However, there is a developed support infrastructure for eﬀorts aimed at
commercializing of university-generated knowledge where various bodies, such as
VINNOVA,2 The Agency for Business Development (NUTEK),3 ALMI Business
Partners (ALMI)4 and Innovationsbron,5 support the ﬁnancing and development of
technology originating from universities. There is also a well-developed private venture
capital market available for technology-intensive projects with growth potential.
Identiﬁcation of cases
This study employs a case study design where we intend to study how the externalentrepreneur model may inﬂuence the ﬁnancing and subsequent development of
USOs. Such a design can be particularly useful for building theories in new and
emerging topic areas where development is needed at both the theoretical and
empirical levels (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2003). In line with our deﬁnition of USOs, we
targeted ﬁrms that had been initiated in a university setting and based on technology
developed at a university (Rasmussen 2011). Industry-backed collaborative spin-oﬀs
that have been formed as a result of a joint venture between the university and an
industrial partner were hence excluded.6 Moreover, eﬀorts were taken to diﬀerentiate
cases according to our interest in exploring the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent entrepreneur
models in ﬁnancing and developing USOs.
We employed the principle of theoretical sampling to identify relevant case ﬁrms
(Yin 2003). This was in line with our goal to make analytic generalizations rather

<-----Page 8----->182

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

than making inferences about a population on the basis of our empirical ﬁndings.
The identiﬁcation of cases representing USOs championed by external entrepreneurs
was made along the two main dimensions that demarcate the characteristics of the
external-entrepreneur model; an independent individual in charge of the USO who is
external both to the original invention and to the university (Franklin, Wright, and
Lockett 2001). The other cases would then represent the inventor-entrepreneur
model, including USOs championed by a university employee who was one of the
original inventors behind the technology. The process of ﬁnding ﬁrms that matched
these various inclusion criteria led to four cases that were willing to participate in the
study.
Data collection
The main period of data collection was conducted between May and October 2006,
using both face-to-face interviews and follow-up telephone interviews with the new
venture champion (CEO) in the selected case ﬁrms. The interviews were semistructured to ensure that the discussion was driven by what the respondents felt was
important and to stay as close as possible to their lived experience. The duration of
the main interviews ranged from 1 to 2 hrs and they were all recorded and
transcribed to enable systematic analysis. Whenever possible, details in the
interviews were veriﬁed and crosschecked with the information from other publicly
available sources to ensure data validity. To utilize the full potential of a case study
design, we also used information from a wide range of other sources. These sources
included annual reports,7 press releases, oﬃcial reports from state and private
organizations, programme and project descriptions, as well as announcements and
articles from Swedish technical newspapers, such as Ny Teknik (Sweden’s leading
technology and IT newspaper) and Elektroniktidningen (the main news source for
professionals in the Swedish electronics industry).
Analysis of case evidence
The procedure for analysing the empirical data can be described as a systematic
process of theory building (Eisenhardt 1989), where we moved from speciﬁc
observations to detect patterns and regularities to ﬁnally end up in some general
conclusions and tentative propositions. The prescribed techniques for analysing
qualitative data suggested by Miles and Huberman (1994) were also utilized to deal
with the vast amount of information collected from each case. In this vein, the
collected data were used to develop a database, which included the use of ‘table
shells’ to categorize the data. The core of this analysis was represented by the
answers from the respondents, veriﬁed by information collected from other sources.
Furthermore, all data were condensed into displays and tables, which reduced a large
amount of information and enabled graphical presentations of the relationship
between events and decisions. This graphical presentation was conducted for all the
cases in the study and created a picture of the process of ﬁnance and development for
each of the USOs. According to Eisenhardt (1989, 534), such an analysis is necessary
in order to become familiar with each case as a separately standing entity. A crosscase analysis was then performed to establish if observations were unique to the
individual case, or if they represented a trend across the entire sample on one or
several parameters of interest (Miles and Huberman 1994).

Description and analysis of the cases
In this section, we present a description and analysis of the four cases. First, we
provide a general description of the four case ﬁrms. This is followed by an analysis of
the case evidence with respect to the eﬀectiveness of the two diﬀerent entrepreneur
models in ﬁnancing and developing the USOs. Throughout the case analysis, we will
discuss the existing research in relation to ﬁndings.

General description of the four cases
The four cases are USOs from three major Swedish universities: Linköping
University (one case), Lund University (one case) and the Royal Institute of
Technology in Stockholm (two cases). Two of the cases represent the inventorentrepreneur model and the other two cases represent the external-entrepreneur
model. In addition, the cases are at diﬀerent stages in their development, are
exploiting diﬀerent types of technology and represent diﬀerent high-tech industries,
such as energy, electronics, microelectronics and telecommunications. Vohora,
Wright, and Lockett (2004, 149) argue that such variance among case ﬁrms can be
utilized to generate valuable insights into the general development process of USOs.
At the same time, it provides a dynamic picture of how ﬁnancial needs may change
over time in diﬀerent life stages of USOs. An overview of each case is shown in
Table 2.
Alpha
Alpha is a USO founded in 2000 and represents the inventor-entrepreneur model,
where one of the original inventors is championing the new venture project. It is a
spin-oﬀ based on research from the Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University.
The USO bases its operations on semiconductor technology in the area of micro- and
nano-scale metal printing. In 2006, when the case study was conducted, Alpha was
internationally recognized as a provider of fast, accurate and cost-eﬀective microscale metallization technology for microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturers by oﬀering complete production solutions, including replication templates,
chemicals, processing guidelines and equipment solutions.
Before Alpha was founded, the team of academic researchers behind the spin-oﬀ
applied for a patent and began to investigate the idea of developing and
commercializing the technology. To ﬁnance this development, the researchers
entered various competitions, applied for scholarships and they also managed to
receive some funding from the university. In addition, they were heavily involved in
exploiting their relationships with the university by relying on various bootstrapping
methods, such as borrowing laboratory equipment, accessing clean rooms for testing
and running experiments, and working for non-market salary. The spin-oﬀ was then
started based on the personal savings of one of the researchers. In addition, the team
received a public soft loan from the Innovation Centre Foundation8 and they also
continued to fund the business through bootstrapping ﬁnance. The main areas of
expenditure during this early period were market research, developing prototype
equipment and costs related to patent ﬁling. The increasing costs for developmental
activities led the ﬁrm to search for supplementary funding from other sources. The
team managed to win a competition prize from VINNOVA, restricted for developing
the technology. Moreover, in this period, the team received a grant from a

foundation connected to the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), which allowed
them to move the spin-oﬀ up to a business incubator in Stockholm and start
collaboration with this university. At this stage, the inventor entrepreneur started to
get a salary. In 2003, Alpha won a Venture Cup competition and the spin-oﬀ also
managed to receive a foundation grant oriented towards developing and
commercializing the technology. The inventor entrepreneur commented on their
participation in diﬀerent competitions, saying that:

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

All these competitions were good because we had deadlines. . . for example, you had to
deliver your plan, or reﬁne it to a certain level, before that day.

The above period can be characterized as when the technology was developed.
However, in 2004, the spin-oﬀ transitioned towards a stronger focus on the
development of a product. This transition was associated with the acquisition of
ﬁnancing from a group of institutional investors, supplemented with a conditional
soft loan from NUTEK. The main areas of expenditure during this transition period
were the development of prototype equipment with the help of hired professional
technicians. This ﬁrst ﬁnancing round by the institutional investors was followed by
a next round provided by the same institutional investors. Meanwhile, the spin-oﬀ
kept on looking for ﬁnancing, and in 2006, they received an R&D grant from
VINNOVA. The reason for the interest in grants was that the spin-oﬀ experienced
their search for venture capital to be a time-consuming process, and that it took
valuable time from reﬁning their core technology and developing a viable product.
The inventor entrepreneur expressed the situation as follows:
We spent over a year talking to the entire market about where to get money. . . and now
we really wanted to continue to focus on product development and not spend another
year speaking to venture capitalists. If you want a new [ﬁnancing] round with new
people it will take another year to get things together.

At the end of the study period, however, Alpha managed to receive funding from
a larger pan-European venture capital ﬁrm focused on investing and developing
technology intensive ﬁrms. The largest area of expenditure in Alpha during this
period was developing the technology to create customer-oriented tools that could be
ready for sale. During the end of the study period, the ﬁrm had seven employees and
they reported a total turnover of about 9.5 MSEK in 2006.
Beta
Beta is a USO founded in 2005 and represents the external-entrepreneur model,
where an individual coming from outside the university is championing the new
venture project. It is a spin-oﬀ based on research from the Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. The spin-oﬀ bases its operations on fuel cell
technology and the business idea when the case study was conducted in 2006 focused
on increased mobility for mobile phone users by providing a small cordless charger
powered by a unique micro fuel cell. The fuel cell can be integrated in small mobile
solutions due to the fact that it operates with a high power density and by using fuel
with high energy density. The waste product from the combustion is water, which
makes the energy production environmentally friendly.

The research team behind Beta applied for a patent before the spin-oﬀ was
established. The team were carrying out closer investigations of the research results
when the decision to start a ﬁrm to commercialize the invention was made by one of
the researchers. This was as an alternative to continue doing research and the initial
capital was invested by the founder. At the same time, Beta had a collaborative
project with a customer, which played a decisive role in attracting a soft loan
provided by ALMI to develop the technology. The money enabled the founder to
hire an external entrepreneur as the CEO. Instead, the founder took position as CEO
while keeping his position at the university. The rest of the money was used for
market analysis, including identiﬁcation of prospective customers and preparing a
business plan. The main areas of expenditure during this period were developing
proof of concept, such as building prototypes. With respect to bootstrapping ﬁnance,
Beta was exploiting collaborations with the university to access public domain
development tools. Beta also emphasized leasing university equipment in order to do
laboratory testing and having people from the scientiﬁc community, such as
professors, researchers and doctoral students, carrying out certain projects held by
the ﬁrm.
However, the funding received was not covering the increasing costs for the
project which led Beta to seek additional sources of ﬁnance. The ﬁrm made the
decision to follow the venture capital track, which resulted in ﬁnance raised from
STING in 2006, a non-commercial organization ﬁnanced from diﬀerent sources,
including public sector venture capital and business angels. As explained by the
external entrepreneur, this seed money allowed them to ‘push the gas pedal and
move on’ with the spin-oﬀ. The ﬁnancial support was also valuable as a conﬁrmation
that the technology had a potential to be commercialized.
Although Beta at this stage could execute their business plan based on the
received venture capital, they were still looking for other sources of ﬁnance that were
not connected to equity partners. The external entrepreneur championing the spinoﬀ explained the motivation behind these eﬀorts as follows:
We got a little bit of [seed] money, okay. . . [But] now we need to further develop the
technology so it actually ﬁts with the idea.

Following this strategy, they entered a competition organized for start-ups by
VINNOVA in 2006, which they also won. The same year, Beta also applied and
received a grant from NUTEK that helped to support about 50% of the needed
technical development. At the end of the study period, the ﬁrm had three employees
and they reported total sales of about 0.1 MSEK.
Gamma
Gamma is a USO founded in 2004 and represents the inventor-entrepreneur model,
where one of the original inventors is championing the new venture project. It is a
spin-oﬀ based on research from Linköping University. The USO bases its operations
on technology that use analog-to-digital converters in parallel with digital error
correction to form a system that could overcome the trade-oﬀ between speed and
accuracy when processing information. The technology enables advances in the area
of radio base station transceiver applications, digital imaging, high-speed data
acquisition and broadband communication.

Gamma was founded by a team consisting of scientists and engineers from
Linköping University. The capital for establishing the spin-oﬀ was derived from the
personal savings of the founders. In addition, the ﬁrm were relying on several ways
of minimizing the ﬁnancial strain on the business, such as accessing public domain
development tools, sharing employees with universities, withholding salaries of
employees and delaying payments to suppliers. The inventor entrepreneur
championing Gamma commented on their wide use of various bootstrapping
ﬁnance to reach business goals as follows:

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

It is all about minimizing the amount of money we have to pay and, of course, the
amount of cash needed [to develop the business]. . .

The early period of Gamma is also marked by a heavy reliance on prizes,
governmental grants and loans. First, the spin-oﬀ won a competition for new
start-ups held by VINNOVA in 2004. During 2004 and 2005, they also managed
to receive soft loans from ALMI and the county administrative board. In
addition, the spin-oﬀ won a competition set up by Venture Cup in 2005. The
funding received was mainly used for technology development, but market
analysis and ﬁling for patents were also signiﬁcant areas of expenditure. The spinoﬀ also identiﬁed and initiated business contacts with customers interested in
developing the technology.
At this time, Gamma got enrolled as partner to other companies and laboratories
in a pan-European R&D programme for advanced microelectronics applications and
other enabling technologies. They were also involved in another R&D programme
oriented towards continued commercialization of research results. Both programmes
were planned for several years ahead and were partly ﬁnanced by VINNOVA.
Verifying the technology was the main area of expenditure and the R&D
programmes gave demonstrations of the products to potential customers and
investors. During this period, the ﬁrm had ﬁve employees and they reported total
sales of about 0.3 MSEK in 2006.

Delta
Delta is a USO founded in 2002 and represents the external-entrepreneur model,
where an individual coming from outside the university is championing the new
venture project. It is a spin-oﬀ from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in
Stockholm. The spin-oﬀ bases its operations on photonic crystals and uses the
technology to develop integrated optical components for Fiber-To-The-Home
networks. The ﬁrm uses patented features that allow for complex structures to be
manufactured without compromising on the optical properties. All necessary
functionality is integrated into one chip, making it simple to mass produce to a low
cost, and its compatibility with existing systems architectures makes it attractive for
upgrading existing systems in a cost-eﬀective way.
Delta was founded by a relatively large team consisting of researchers, venture
capitalists and industrialists/managers. The capital used to start the spin-oﬀ
comprised mainly of personal savings from some of the founders, supplemented
with venture capital from Swedish and Danish business angels. This funding was
used for analysing diﬀerent research areas since the scientists did not have a

<-----Page 14----->188

D. Politis et al.

developed product idea that could be readily commercialized. The external
entrepreneur comments upon this by saying:
. . .after we analysed and investigated diﬀerent opportunities, we came up with a match,
basically, of a product that we thought might be interesting for the market. . . so we
started developing the ﬁrst product.

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

Similar to Beta, which also represents the external-entrepreneur model, Delta
emphasized the use of various bootstrapping methods that allowed them to engage
people from the scientiﬁc community in carrying out certain projects held by the
spin-oﬀ. The external entrepreneur who championed Delta expressed the situation as
follows:
. . .although we did not have many employees, we always had a large number of people
at the university working on our ideas. That gave us the possibility to attract people
with necessary business and technical expertise for a consultancy fee, but without hiring
them as employees.

The capital received from the business angels in the start-up phase was
supplemented with a soft loan from NUTEK in 2003. The ﬁrst priority of Gamma
was to search for a large company that could co-operate with the spin-oﬀ in a
consulting project which later could be turned into a commercial product. However,
no agreements were reached with any potential partners as the technology at that
stage was not oriented towards any applications on the market. The main areas of
expenditure during this period were developing proof of concept and the acquisition
of professional expertise in the form of diﬀerent consultancy services.
Continued need to cover costs for product development led to that an additional
round of ﬁnancing was raised through a Swedish venture capitalist in 2004. Coupled
with the previous capital acquired, the new ﬁnancial capital was enough to build the
ﬁrst prototype. According to the external entrepreneur, the prototype ‘more or less
looks like a product and more or less works like a product that you can show
customers’. The spin-oﬀ saw a need for a signiﬁcant amount of more capital to
ﬁnalize the product. However, an alternative project idea showed to be more
promising than the ﬁrst product idea. This led to that the spin-oﬀ refocused towards
the second potentially more proﬁtable product idea and the marketing strategy was
reshaped. When Delta managed to ﬁnd potential customers, they received an R&D
grant from VINNOVA and later also an R&D check from STING in 2006. The
main areas of expenditure during this period were developing prototypes and
evaluating new products. During the end of the study period, the ﬁrm had one
employee and they reported zero sales in 2006.
Development after the study period9
Commercializing technology based on the technology developed at a university is a
high-risk venture and many contingencies are at play inﬂuencing the survival and
success of such endeavours. A follow-up of the four diﬀerent spin-oﬀs shows that
they have developed in diﬀerent directions since the completion of the case study
period. Alpha was experiencing sales growth during 2007 and 2008. However, sales
dropped signiﬁcantly in 2009 and the ﬁrm ﬁled for bankruptcy in early 2011. Beta
has reported very modest annual sales and negative earnings. However, they have

<-----Page 15----->Venture Capital

continued to work for a major product launch based on their technology and their
number of employees has increased to seven in 2010. Gamma has showed a steady
development. In 2010, the ﬁrm had 18 employees and reported about 18.5 MSEK in
total sales. Delta had a peak in sales of about 2 MSEK in 2007. After this year, their
sale dropped signiﬁcantly and in 2010, the ﬁrm had only one employee and reported
about 0.5 MSEK in total sales.

Characteristics of the two diﬀerent entrepreneur models
Analysis of our case evidence suggests that the stylized characteristics that often
are attached to the two diﬀerent entrepreneur models to some extent are valid,
but also needs some extension. On the one hand, it seems fair to argue that the
cases representing the inventor-entrepreneur model have a venture champion with
a stronger commitment to the technology and with more limited commercial
experience, and vice versa. Interestingly, these diﬀerences manifest themselves in
diﬀerent lines of reasoning in relation to ﬁnance among the diﬀerent types of
champions. For example, champions representing the inventor-entrepreneur model
expressed considerably more satisfaction with public sources of ﬁnance, such as
governmental ‘soft loans’ and grants, especially in the longer run, as they come
with nearly no strings attached. This preference could, to some extent, be related
to their knowledge and understanding of the Swedish public support system for
R&D projects, which includes commercialization grants. However, their tendency
to favour public ﬁnance could, to a large extent, also be associated with their
interest in protecting their project from external inﬂuences. Hence, private equity
partners were more or less expressed as a last resort (Cressy and Olofsson 1997,
184) as this would lead to a loss of independence and reduce the control of their
ventures. The inventor entrepreneur who championed Alpha described the
situation as follows in one of the interviews:
I would prefer to take zero venture capital money, which is the most expensive money
you can ever have, because you sell your company to other people.

On the contrary, champions representing the external-entrepreneur model were
more expressing a preference for private sources of ﬁnance as drivers of venture
development and private equity partners, such as business angels and VCs, were
seen as a mechanism for growing the spin-oﬀ as aggressive and eﬀective as
possible. In relation to this, external entrepreneurs were favouring a more
business-oriented model for ﬁnancing and commercializing the technology where
loss of control (ownership) to private equity partners was seen as necessary to
control the future development of the USO. This was, among other things,
illustrated in their reasoning about the value of various ﬁnancial bootstrapping
methods. On a general level, all cases were using bootstrapping methods for
securing resources at low or no cost, which can be explained by the wide use of
such methods across ﬁrms of all types (Ebben 2007; Winborg 2009; Jones and
Jayawarna 2010). However, the external entrepreneurs were also expressing
concerns with relying too much on bootstrapping methods to ﬁnance the spin-oﬀ
since they thought it could constitute a threat to further development. Rather
than minimizing costs, they were emphasizing the need to generate real
expenditures to attract external ﬁnance and then also to create cash ﬂow through

<-----Page 16----->190

sales. Commenting on this issue, the external entrepreneur championing Beta
expressed it as follows:

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

You need to do certain things [which create expenditures] to develop the company. If
you do not do it, you do not increase the value of the company. . .We cannot minimize
and limit costs for everything, then we are just locking ourselves in the corner.

Hence, there was a clear distinction among the champions representing the two
diﬀerent entrepreneur models with respect to three dimensions: their ﬁnancial
preferences, technology focus and control orientation. A stylized description of the
two entrepreneur models based on case evidence is presented in Table 3.
As can be seen in Table 3, the inventor-entrepreneur model shows a higher
preference for public sources in ﬁnancing and developing their ventures while the
external-entrepreneur model is more focused on using private sources. When it
comes to technology focus, the inventor-entrepreneur model demonstrates a higher
interest in developing technology, while the external entrepreneurs highly
emphasized the importance of commercializing technology in order to develop the
ﬁrm. Finally, the inventor entrepreneur shows a rather high reluctance towards
equity funding as this may decrease their control of the ﬁrm. On the contrary, the
external entrepreneur welcomes private external ﬁnance as a meaningful and
necessary way to acquire control of the future. Even though we present the case
analyses in a simpliﬁed dichotomous fashion, it seems fair to argue that the two
entrepreneur models can be considered as two distinctive ways of reasoning and
acting in patterns of ﬁnancial behaviour.
The inﬂuence of entrepreneur model on the development paths of USOs
The analysis of our case analysis shows that champions who represent the externalentrepreneur model have a diﬀerent mind-set that to some extent makes them better
equipped to deal with opportunities and obstacles related to ﬁnancing and
developing USOs. However, on further examination, our case analysis also suggests
that the consequences of these stylized characteristics related to each entrepreneur
model have a relatively minor inﬂuence on how the venture is actually ﬁnanced and
developed. Rather, the analysis speaks more in favour of two other factors, or
contingencies that are at play across all four cases and which to various degrees, but
with similar directions, have a much more salient inﬂuence on the development path
of USOs. Figure 1 illustrates these identiﬁed factors.
The ﬁrst factor to have a salient inﬂuence on the development path of USOs
relates to the commercialization of novel technology. Similarities in ﬁnancial
decisions and behaviours across all cases can in this respect, to some extent, be
explained by the fact that USOs are launched before they have a match between

Factors inﬂuencing the development path of USOs.

technology and market. Ideally, a new venture is started based on observable
customer needs that are not properly satisﬁed. The initial process of idea
development resembles a ‘problemistic search’ procedure (Cyert and March 1963,
121), where an immediate problem motivates the search for a satisfactory solution
that over time become more elaborated as the new venture is developing. However,
rather than being initiated by a perceived problem, the USOs are based on R&D
projects that generate technologies or scientiﬁc discoveries without any commercial
applications in mind. When becoming aware of its commercial potential, the
founding team then start to generate ideas for new products or services, often
without much regard to market acceptance or commercial viability of the invention
or new technology (i.e. Wright, Vohora, and Lockett 2004, 297). This situation
means that there may be a need to continually conduct evaluations and search for
possible markets during the development of the spin-oﬀ, which in turn may lead to
both adjustments in the underlying technology as well as recognition of additional
market opportunities. The initial process of idea development underlying USOs may
in this respect best be described as ‘opportunistic surveillance’ (i.e. Thompson 1967,
151) where venturing eﬀorts are motivated by the search for a range of alternative
commercial applications and which do not therefore stop when a ﬁrst problem
solution has been found. The situation was well described by the external
entrepreneur championing Beta, who expressed it as follows:
We grew out of a technical idea. If I had done that completely on my own, without a
technical idea, I would have started going out meeting people, looking for a problem,
and then I would have looked for a technology to solve that problem. . . But this
opportunity came across me when there already was a technology [developed], so I had
to ﬁnd out a problem.

Related to the above, all case ﬁrms are initially suﬀering from uncertainties
associated with high-technology start-ups, which is typically related both to the
viability of the technology as well as the interest of its application in the market
(Chesbrough 2004). Hence, even if external entrepreneurs were expressing a
preference for private sources of ﬁnance, they are also fully aware of the need to
increase the legitimacy of the business and develop a proof-of-concept to attract
high-level investors. Thus, regardless of preferences all entrepreneurs were to a high
degree focused on attracting public sector venture capital to develop the technology.

<-----Page 18----->192

D. Politis et al.

The inventor entrepreneur championing Alpha expressed the heavy reliance on this
source of ﬁnance in the early stages of venture development in the following way:

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

When you have almost nothing but an idea and a few experiments, you cannot really get
that kind of money [private venture capital] . . . you need to have some proof ﬁrst.

This observation is supported by Lindström and Olofsson (2001, 166) who give a
similar explanation for the high reliance on public sector ﬁnance among USOs in
general, suggesting that it makes it possible to launch ventures even if they lack a
market focus and a comprehensive business concept. In addition, our case analysis
also supports the reputation eﬀects attached to small-scale funding provided from
public sources to high-tech ventures in pre-commercialization stages, which has been
noted by Klofsten, Jonsson, and Simón (1998). In this vein, receiving public soft
loans and grants leads to a gain in reputation and image among the USOs. This, in
turn, increased their credibility and made them more attractive for other ﬁnanciers.
The funding also initiated business operations and a consistent strategy, which was
necessary in order to continue the development of the venture. However, it was the
improvement in reputation supporting the viability of the technology that was
registered by all the ﬁrms as the most positive eﬀect gained from this funding source,
which was instrumental in attracting funding in later stages.
The second factor that seems to have a salient inﬂuence on the development path
of USOs relates to the team-based character of technology-based venturing (Clarysse
and Moray 2004; Shrader and Siegel 2007). This means that USOs develop very
much in relation to the new venture team. Initially, these are centred on the founding
team, whose competencies and perspectives function as a reference point when
decisions about the USO are made. For example, in our study, none of the spin-oﬀs
had any hierarchical structure when the ﬁrms were ﬁrst set-up and all founding team
members participated in the decision process, with the champion as the oﬃcial
leader. There is also little evidence on any autocratic leadership style where the
champions make decisions largely independently of, and with little or no input from
the rest of the founding team. Rather, the leadership style was in all cases more
participative and with the champions acting as informal leaders. The external
entrepreneur championing Beta, for example, described his close collaboration with

the researcher who had initiated the spin-oﬀ during the development of the venture
as follows:

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

. . . [there was] one person responsible for, and very good at the technology . . . and I am
a business developer . . . so we were not two technicians. We were two [persons], and we
could help each other out . . .

This highly informal character of decision making seems to change somewhat
when the USOs continue to develop, leading the organizations to become
increasingly formalized. This change calls for a more authoritarian leadership style
at the expense of founding team members with the champion supporting further
growth and development by providing guidance and clear directions, very much in
line with what is described in Greiner (1972) and Kazanjian (1988). However, at this
stage, the decreasing inﬂuence of the original founding team is supplemented with an
increasing inﬂuence from other key players that now are part of an extended team,
such as, for example, key employees and the board of directors (Gabrielsson and
Huse 2002; Bjørnåli and Gulbrandsen 2010; Rasmussen 2011). The motivation to
involve people in decision making during venture development was, for example,
described by the inventor entrepreneur championing Delta as follows:
. . . the major reason [for raising external capital] was that we needed more professional
ﬁnance people on the board.

In all, the case evidence suggests that the potential inﬂuence of the champion
relative to other founding team members increases when the USO matures and
develops. However, during this process, decisions are increasingly made with
reference to an extended team of players, such as for example the board of directors.
Thus, decisions aimed at inﬂuencing the direction and performance of the USO are
primarily made in a team-based context which reduces the inﬂuence of the single
entrepreneur on venture development.
An interesting observation is that the control-loss associated with outside equity
seems to become more acceptable among inventor entrepreneurs when it is
accompanied by compensation in needed management skills that the growing
organization requires, which to some extent corroborate ﬁndings in Cressy and
Olofsson (1997, 192). Moreover, moving through critical junctures as the spin-oﬀ
develops creates opportunities for learning and feedback for both the venture
champion and his founding team (Clarysse and Moray 2004; Vohora, Wright, and
Lockett 2004). This suggests that both inventor entrepreneurs and external
entrepreneurs seem to beneﬁt from accessing technical competence and/or advice
on business matters from their surroundings.
To conclude, our analysis suggests that there is no clear-cut relationship between
the champion as a single decision maker and the development path of USOs, which
is an assumption that the external-entrepreneur model very much relies on. Instead,
the venture champions are operating in a broader context where both the novelty of
technology as well as interactions with co-founders and other close team associates
very much inﬂuence directions and courses of actions. Thus, our ﬁndings suggest
that a meaningful assessment and analysis of the value of an external entrepreneur
championing a USO is only possible in conjunction with additional contingencies
related to the novel technology that is being commercialized and the team-based

<-----Page 20----->194

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 20:48 25 August 2012

character of spin-oﬀ venturing. An aggregated summary of the processes that seem
to inﬂuence venture ﬁnance and development across the four USOs is presented in
Table 4.
Implications
Our analysis suggests that external entrepreneurs have a diﬀerent mind-set that
makes them better equipped to deal with opportunities and obstacles related to
ﬁnancing and developing USOs. However, we also ﬁnd supporting evidence that the
development paths of USOs are embedded in a more complex web of pathdependent interactions, where the championship of the USO becomes interwoven
with existing and emerging social relationships and technological challenges. Thus,
our ﬁndings strongly advise against using simple projections of the development path
of spin-oﬀs based on stylized entrepreneur-models. Rather, further examinations of
the external-entrepreneur phenomenon should pay careful attention to how these
spin-oﬀ champions interact with their social surrounding to develop the direction
and performance of the USOs they champion. These eﬀorts could be guided by
theoretical approaches that acknowledge the interaction and interdependence
between the external entrepreneur and the immediate resource environment where
the new ventures operate, such as resource dependence theory (Pfeﬀer and Salancik
1978; Boyd 1990) or social network theory (Larson 1992). Moreover, entrepreneurial
learning theories (e.g. Politis 2005; Corbett 2007; Gabrielsson and Politis 2011) may
also be a fruitful way forward since they generally recognize the role of feedback
from the social surroundings for the ability to exploit business opportunities and
develop new emerging organizations.
Another implication based on our ﬁndings is the need to avoid the intuitive
question whether the external-entrepreneur model is more eﬀective than the
inventor-entrepreneur model for ﬁnancing and developing USOs. Instead, the focus
should rather be on ﬁnding or locating contexts where the external-entrepreneur
model can add value by supplementing shortages in the supply of inventor
entrepreneurs that are willing to commercialize technology generated from university
research. Such approaches recognize that the key problem in promoting spin-oﬀ
development is not an issue of ability but an issue of motivation, where the general
lack of interest among faculty members to become entrepreneurs can be solved in
diﬀerent ways. The traditional way relies very much on the inventor-entrepreneur
model where eﬀorts have been taken to build up university-based support structures,
often centred on Technology Transfer Oﬃces (TTOs), to make up for the limited
commercial experience and lack of industry networks among academic entrepreneurs. However, by recognizing the external-entrepreneur model as a largely viable
and potentially under-utilized alternative, there is instead a need to conduct basic
research to explore the breadth and scope of this phenomenon. This requires studies
from both demand-side and supply-side perspectives. Supply-side perspectives
include studies of where we ﬁnd external entrepreneurs, in what constellations they
appear, what motivates them and how their involvement changes during diﬀerent
stages of the spin-oﬀ project. Demand-side perspectives include studies of where and
when there is a lack of available academic entrepreneurs for championing viable
spin-oﬀ projects. For example, is there a shortage in diﬀerent science and technology
areas, or can we relate shortages to diﬀerent types of universities or regions?
Moreover, are there shortages in diﬀerent stages of spin-oﬀ development? Examining

these issues can provide policy-makers with fruitful information about where
external entrepreneurs can be a value-adding mechanism in eﬀorts to support the
commercialization of technology originating from university research.
Moreover, empirical studies of existing support initiatives that already use
external entrepreneurs are also warranted. Such eﬀorts can ﬁnd inspiration in the
pioneering study of Franklin, Wright, and Lockett (2001) who examined the attitude
to and use of external entrepreneurs among UK universities for promoting the
development of USOs. Replicating and developing their study also in other countries
would be a highly relevant way forward to map the external-entrepreneur
phenomenon. Moreover, scholars should also seek outside TTOs to ﬁnd relevant
support initiatives. One such area could be when students are used to commercialize
university-generated knowledge. For example, some Swedish universities have
master programmes where students are matched with a research project that has
potential commercial applications. Another ongoing bottom-up initiative in Sweden
is the ‘Research to Reality’ project that matches entrepreneurially minded students
with R&D projects at their home universities. Evaluating experiences from both topdown and bottom-up approaches would be highly valuable for understanding
strengths and weaknesses of the external-entrepreneur model in various settings.
Obviously, such approaches also call for further reﬁnements of the existing largely
stylized inventor-entrepreneur model, where external entrepreneurs may vary both in
their relation to the technology and the university.
In all, despite the insights provided in this particular study, there is a range of
questions that remain to be answered about the external entrepreneur phenomenon.
We thus welcome further studies of this emerging research area that we believe has
great potential to provide both practitioners and policy-makers with actionable
knowledge about how to increase the commercialization of technology developed at
universities.

A ‘soft loan’ is a special means of debt ﬁnance provided by government agencies to startups. Usually, the loan is oﬀered at lower-than-market interest rates and with ﬂexible or
lenient terms for repayment.
VINNOVA is a Swedish government agency created in 2001 to promote sustainable
growth in Sweden by funding needs-driven research and the development of eﬀective
innovation systems.
The Agency for Business Development (NUTEK) was created in 1991 with the aim of
supporting business development and regional development activities. It was in operation
during the case study period. However, the activities carried out by NUTEK were in 2009
taken over by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Tillväxtverket).
ALMI Business Partners (ALMI) is a state-owned organization consisting of 21 regional
oﬃces spread over Sweden. ALMI was created in 1991 with the aim to create growth and
innovation in Sweden by promoting the development of new and small businesses.

Innovationsbron was created in 2005 and is an organization speciﬁcally focused on
turning research and innovation into business. The overall vision is that Sweden will
become an international leader in commercializing research-related business ideas.
For more information about this type of companies, see Wright, Vohora, and Lockett
(2004).
For one of the ﬁrms (see ‘Beta’ section), it was impossible to get access to annual reports
due to its early stage of development.
Innovation Centre Foundation stopped their ﬁnancing of early-stage ventures in 2004 and
their operations were replaced by ALMI Business Partner.
As we have no detailed case data from this period, we do not make any analysis of
possible connections between the continued development of the spin-oﬀs and the
entrepreneur model on which they based their start-up and early development. However,
as will be emphasized in the coming analysis, it seems unlikely that any such strong
connections exist.
