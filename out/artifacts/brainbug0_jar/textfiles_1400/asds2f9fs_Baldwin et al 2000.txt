ew firms play a key role in shaping economic change. Entrants are a source of dynamism—they
offer consumers innovative goods and services, often by developing new, or responding to existing,
market niches. They bring pressure to bear on older businesses, forcing them to structure their operations
efficiently, and to respond more quickly to changes in consumer demand. In short, new firms are
essential to the competitive process—the forces at play within an economy that reward certain firms and
penalize others.
While new firms are important, the life of a new firm is a precarious one. Entrepreneurs take substantial
risks when starting new ventures. While some realize significant returns, others, indeed the majority,
exit the market after only a few years of operation. The large percentage of entrants that fail has focused
attention on the factors that determine the success or failure of a new firm. This issue is of interest to
entrepreneurs, credit lenders, public officials, economists, and indeed all who are interested in how an
economy creates innovation and wealth. Like most intriguing issues, it has many different dimensions.
Are firms that enter certain industries more likely to be successful? Are very young firms the most
vulnerable to failure? Is failure driven more by the idiosyncrasies of individual firms than by the
structure of certain markets? How influential is the timing of entry in determining success?
This report addresses many of these questions. It explores differences in failure rates across many
important dimensions—such as a firm’s province or industry of origin. It asks what role firm size plays
in determining success or failure, along with factors that relate to the intensity of competition that young
firms face. It examines how the determinants of failure differ across new firms at different stages of their
lifecycle, and whether the factors that influence failure are consistent across different entry periods.
The report is the fourth in a series of studies that investigate dynamic change in key sectors of the
economy. The first, Strategies for Success (Baldwin et al., 1994), examined small- and medium-sized
firms that were growing during the last half of the 1980s. It found that innovation was strongly
correlated with success, and that small growing firms stress the development of basic financial and
management competencies. The second, Successful Entrants: Creating the Capacity for Survival and
Growth (Johnson, Baldwin and Hinchley, 1997), focused on new small successful entrants, firms that
reached their early teen years. It developed a more extensive profile of the financial structure and
operating practices of these firms. Like its predecessor, it found that innovation is strongly associated
with growth. It also demonstrated that the financial structure of successful firms varies depending upon
the knowledge-intensity of the host industry. The third report, Failing Concerns: Business Bankruptcy in
Canada (Baldwin et al., 1997), represented a departure from our traditional focus on ‘more successful’
firms, and instead examined factors that contribute to business bankruptcies. It found that both external
shocks and internal deficiencies influence bankruptcy patterns, their relative importance varying
considerably across firms. Of these internal deficiencies, basic shortcomings in management and
financing were most consequential.

with a specific focus on the latter. While these previous three studies were based on firm surveys, this
project draws on a special database developed at Statistics Canada using administrative data. This
database can be used to track the characteristics of individual firms over time. This allows us to apply
statistical methods that are designed specifically for analyzing differences in survival and failure rates.
The principal advantage of this study, in our view, rests with its comprehensiveness—it represents the
first analysis of survival patterns in all major sectors of the Canadian economy.

his study investigates the determinants of failure for new Canadian firms. It explores the role that
certain factors play in conditioning the likelihood of survival—factors related to industry structure,
firm demographics and macroeconomic cycles. It asks whether the determinants of failure are different
for new start-ups than for firms that have reached adolescence, and if the magnitude of these differences
is economically significant. It examines whether, after controlling for certain influences, failure rates
differ across industries and provinces.
Two themes figure prominently in this analysis. The first is the impact that certain industry
characteristics—such as average firm size and concentration—have on the entry/exit process, either
through their influence on failure costs or on the intensity of competition. The second centres on how the
dimensions of failure evolve over time as new firms gain market experience.
Why Focus on New Firms?
New firms play a key role in the evolution of an industry. Entrants introduce new products and develop
new technologies. As an important source of innovation, they bring competitive pressure to bear on
established firms. These pressures often arise as new firms pursue customization and niche market
strategies as a means of gaining market share.
For many new firms, however, life is short and uncertain. One-half of all entrants fail prior to their third
birthday. Only one in five survive a decade. Those that do survive often grow. Over successive years, the
cumulative effect of survivors on the industry landscape is substantial.
The line between success and failure is a tenuous one. Why do certain firms survive and prosper, while
others decline and fail? Economists have expressed growing interest in the underlying causes of
failure—specifically, whether they stem from the idiosyncrasies of individual firms, are endemic to
certain industries, or reflect underlying macroeconomic conditions. Research on these issues finds a
wide audience. Lenders of credit want to know if firms with certain characteristics are statistically more
likely to fail. Public officials want to know if the causes of failure are, in some way, amenable to policy
intervention. Prospective business owners want to be able to distinguish safe strategies from risky ones.
How are Entry and Exit Related?
Entry and exit are positively correlated: The more firms that enter an industry, the more firms that fail
(Caves, 1998; Geroski, 1995). While previous studies have investigated the causes of failure, less
attention has been devoted to exploring the formal relationship between the factors that condition exit
and those that encourage entry. This analysis goes some way towards filling this void—by offering a
basic model of the entry/exit process.

<-----Page 11----->This framework draws on two major themes. The first is the costs of experimentation associated with the
entry decision. For any potential new firm, the decision to enter is a risky one, as many entrants fail,
often shortly after start-up. If the costs of the entry gamble are high—due, for example, to the existence
of sunk costs – fewer firms can be expected to take the entry gamble. As a result, fewer new firms can be
expected to fail. The second theme focuses on the role that competition plays in conditioning the failure
rate. New firms may benefit from, or succumb to, changes in competitive pressure.
Our framework explores how certain facets of an industry’s structure—such as its firm size
characteristics, or its rate of job turnover—influence the entry decision, and hence, the failure rate.
How Does Industry Structure Influence the Hazard Rate?
Industry characteristics that affect the costs of entry lead to differences in aggregate survival rates. New
firms in industries with relatively small firm sizes are more likely to fail than those in industries with
larger size characteristics. This means that if failure costs increase with average industry firm size or
average industry entrant size, then hazard rates are inversely related to the costs of experimentation. On
the other hand, there is less evidence from aggregate survival rates that differences in competitive
intensity influence failure patterns. At first blush, industry concentration and job turnover have less of an
impact on hazard rates than an industry’s firm size characteristics.
The above impressions are based on aggregate survival rates—rates that embody, but do not formally
account for, the myriad of macroeconomic, industry-level and firm-specific factors that condition failure.
After controlling for all these effects, industry-level characteristics such as concentration, turnover, and
relative entrant size (measured as the ratio of an industry’s average first-year firm size to its overall firm
size) still influence the failure rate. However, their effect is often minor.
The nature of these industry effects can vary depending upon the age of the firm. Both concentration and
relative entrant size affect infant firms and adolescents in different ways. For firms in their first-year,
more concentration and larger entrant characteristics lead to a higher probability of survival. For firms in
their fifth year, the reverse is true. For both infants and adolescents, an increase in turnover at the
industry level leads to more failure.
Are New Firms in Certain Provinces More Likely to Fail?
There are some basic differences in survival rates across provinces, but these differences are more
complicated than they first appear. In terms of aggregate survival rates, new firms in Ontario fare better
than those in other provinces. However, differences between Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British
Columbia are slight. New firms in Manitoba and Saskatchewan fare somewhat less well, whereas the
highest failure rates occur in Atlantic Canada.
After controlling for the influence of other factors on the hazard rate, differences in provincial survival
rates remain, but the nature of these differences depends upon the age of the firm. The likelihood that
start-ups will survive their initial year differs dramatically across provinces. Firms in their initial year of
life exhibit a much higher success rate in Ontario (80%) than in the Atlantic Provinces (63%-67%).
Business start-ups in British Columbia (78%), Quebec (77%) and Alberta (76%) are more likely to
survive their first year than are those in Saskatchewan (73%) or Manitoba (70%).

<-----Page 12----->For firms that have survived the vicissitudes of infancy, a very different pattern emerges. Five-year old
firms in Ontario are no more likely to survive their fifth year than are firms in other provinces. Five-year
old firms in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec are less likely to fail than
their counterparts in Ontario. This said, provincial survival rates for five-year old firms are uniformly
high (at roughly 90%).
Are New Firms in Certain Industries More Likely to Fail?
New firms in certain industries fare better than those in others; however, the nature of these differences
changes over the course of an entrant’s life-cycle. Among goods-producing industries, new firms in
mining and manufacturing have among the highest aggregate survival rates. In the services sector,
entrants in wholesale trade, real estate industries and business services fare relatively well.
Aggregate survival rates are affected by the characteristics of firms contained in an industry. When these
are formally taken into account, a different view of the industrial landscape emerges. New firms in
certain industries still fare better than those in others—for instance, entrants in fishing and trapping
outperform their counterparts in manufacturing. The magnitude of these differences, however, is often
slight. Stronger evidence of industry effects emerges at different stages of the entrant lifecycle,
particularly among infant firms. New start-ups in wholesale trade, business services and real estate
industries are among the most likely to survive their first year. These industry differences become less
apparent among adolescent firms.
Are Start-Ups More Vulnerable than Adolescents?
Failure rates are often highest among newborn firms. Certain aspects of market structure that influence
survival rates—for example, average size characteristics, average rates of entry—have a greater effect on
start-ups than on adolescents. There is also some evidence of a honeymoon effect—the temporary
insurance against failure afforded by a firm’s initial stock of assets. When the effect of age is separated
from other influences on the failure rate, the advantages of market experience become clear. The
likelihood of failure decreases with age. This said, the advantages that experience brings tend to
diminish over time.
While the likelihood of survival increases with the age of the firm, its effect on other factors that
condition the survival rate is more complex. Geographic and industry-specific differences are more
apparent in new start-ups than in adolescent firms. New firms are more vulnerable to basic changes in
market structure. However, changes in relative efficiency, as proxied by relative size, are equally if not
more important in older firms.
Are the Reasons for Failure Macroeconomic, Industry-Specific, or Firm-Specific?
The underlying dynamics of failure are varied and complex. There is no single reason why certain
entrants fail while others succeed. The determinants of failure occur on different levels—and encompass
the idiosyncrasies of individual firms, the structural characteristics of particular markets, and the vitality
of the larger macroeconomy. There is evidence that each affects the failure rate of new firms.
In the first instance, firm-specific factors exert a strong influence on the failure rate. The likelihood of
survival increases sharply with the age of the firm, and the factors that contribute to failure affect firms
of various ages differently.
Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

11

<-----Page 13----->Size also plays a major role in determining success or failure—in particular, the size of new firms
relative to the first-year entrant average within the industry. A proxy for relative efficiency, this measure
of size is both firm- and industry-specific. An increase in relative firm size leads to a higher likelihood of
survival. What is more, deviations from the average bring about sharp fluctuations in the failure rate.
New firms that are relatively large are more likely to succeed, whereas those with size disadvantages are
more likely to fail. This is true both for new start-ups and adolescents.
The firm size characteristics of industries also influence the failure rate. Start-ups that enter industries
that have large entrants relative to the general business population have a lower likelihood of failure. The
reverse is true of new firms when they reach adolescence—industries with large entrant characteristics
bring about more failure.
Concentration and turnover—two conventional measures of the intensity of competition—also influence
the failure rate. In the first instance, their effect on aggregate survival rates is largely ambiguous,
suggesting that the relationship between competition and the survival rate is not necessarily
unidirectional. When the failure rate is modelled formally, the nature of these effects becomes more
apparent. Interestingly, these can differ depending upon the age of the firm. New start-ups will benefit
from industry structures that are more concentrated. For adolescent firms, the opposite is true—more
concentration leads to more, not less, failure. Increased turnover leads to more failure in start-ups and
adolescents. This being said, changes in industry concentration and turnover have less impact on survival
rates than those associated with changes in relative firm size.
Macroeconomic conditions also exert a modest influence on the survival rate. The fortunes of new firms
vary cyclically with the business cycle—a higher growth rate in real output leads to more survival.
Does the Timing of Entry Matter?
Substantial differences in survival rates are evident across entry periods. These reflect underlying
differences in macroeconomic conditions. As these often differ across regions, generalizations about the
relative riskiness of different jurisdictions or industries should only be made with caution. Entrant
cohorts that are associated with good macroeconomic conditions not only have a lower mean failure rate
but are also less affected by size disadvantages. For these cohorts, changes in the intensity of
competition play a greater role in determining success or failure. This suggests that the factors that
motivate the entry decision differ across the business cycle.

<-----Page 14----->Chapter 1 – Introduction

E

ntry and exit are central to the study of industrial dynamics. The net effect of new firms on an
industry is principally determined by (i) the instantaneous and cumulative rates of entry, (ii) the
growth rates exhibited by emerging firms, and (iii) the rate at which entrants fail. This study speaks to
two of these issues directly—it focuses squarely on new firms, and it investigates the role that certain
factors play in conditioning the exit process.
Our primary objective in undertaking this study is to gain a broader understanding of the post-entry
performance of new firms. Numerous issues motivate research in this area: Are new start-ups more
likely to fail than adolescent firms? Does more entry encourage more failure? Is failure a random or a
systematic process? If the latter, are the causes of failure specific to individual firms, endemic to certain
industry environments, or highly correlated with macroeconomic conditions?
While previous work has offered new insight into many of these issues, the present study has, in our
view, two major advantages.

First, it is extremely comprehensive. Drawing from a Statistics Canada micro-database that tracks the
payroll and employment characteristics of individual firms over time, it develops a profile of post-entry
performance based on all entrants in goods and services industries over a period of ten or more years.
This alleviates the traditional dependence on the manufacturing sector—often the primary focus of
studies of firm survival; moreover, given that our estimates are based on actual population data, it
removes the possibility of any potential bias that may result from the use of small and/or
unrepresentative samples.
Second, the analysis offers a new perspective on the entry and exit process—one that goes some way
towards developing more formal models of firm survival. As much of the research on failure rates is
empirically driven, there is often little attempt to explore the determinants of exit in any formal way,
other than to state and evaluate their hypothesized influence on the failure rate. We develop our view of
the entry and exit process with two major themes in mind.
The first of these focuses on the costs of experimentation associated with entry. Entry can be seen as a
risky gamble. New firms ascertain their relative competency by investing in knowledge both prior and
subsequent to entry.1 Industry characteristics that influence the cost of post-entry experimentation are
thus likely to be correlated with the exit process. In industries where the cost of failure is high, potential
entrants are more inclined to acquire information on their relative competency prior to entry. That is,
they will be more inclined to invest in pre-entry evaluation. This leads to a higher probability of entrant
survival in these industries. Conversely, industries where the costs of experimentation are lower
encourage a larger complement of firms to take the entry gamble in order to ascertain their relative
competency, leading to a higher failure rate among young firms.

1

Our framework draws from Jovanovic (1982). In his seminal paper, firms gauge their relative efficiency from actual postentry performance. Efficient firms, wherein “ability exceeds expectations”, survive and grow; by contrast, inefficient firms,
where the converse is true, decline and fail. For a useful overview, see Audretsch (1995).

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

13

<-----Page 15----->The second theme focuses on the relation between competition and exit. The intensity of competition
may affect the amount of market room available to new firms. More competition may have dire
consequences for entrants (as the market is less forgiving), or it may create new opportunities (by giving
rise to new market niches). The competitive intensity of markets also affects the ability of established
firms to react to the threat posed by new entrants. Relative differences in these factors may help explain
inter-industry differences in the failure rates of new firms.
The analysis is as follows:
Chapter 2 provides a brief overview of our data source—the Longitudinal Employment Analysis
Program (LEAP) database.
Chapter 3 provides a first examination of entry and survival rates. We report entry and survival rates for
new firms in 15 major industry divisions (e.g., manufacturing, wholesale trade, construction). Provincial
survival rates are also investigated.
In Chapter 4, we present our conceptual framework of the entry and exit process—a stylized model in
which certain industry characteristics influence the failure rate. Two industry variables—average firm
size and average entrant size—are used to proxy the cost of market experimentation. Two others—a
concentration ratio and the rate of job turnover—are proxies for the intensity of competition. Data and
measurement issues are then addressed.
Chapter 5 investigates differences in survival and hazard rates across clusters of industries—clusters that
are designed to evaluate the significance of our entry and exit framework. For instance, we ask whether
new firms in industries with small average firm sizes are more, or less, likely to survive than are entrants
in industries with larger firm sizes. An inverse relationship between firm size and the failure rate would
provide some initial evidence that post-entry performance is correlated with the costs of market
experimentation. After examining the impact of each of our proxies, we evaluate the relative strength of
these effects by investigating the relation between entry rates and failure rates. As a final exercise, we
report two parsimonious measures of inter-industry differences in failure rates—the average length of life
(of new firms) and median length of life.
Chapter 6 investigates how differences in inter-industry failure rates evolve over time. Using a hazard
rate analysis, we examine the risk of failure facing new firms at two distinct stages of the lifecycle:
infancy and early adolescence.
The results outlined in previous sections are based on aggregate survival data. In these exercises, each of
the factors that are posited to affect the failure rate is examined individually. In Chapter 7, we investigate
the determinants of failure jointly—by looking at the importance of individual factors after controlling
for the effects of others. Our analysis at this stage serves various objectives. These are summarized
below.
•

14

We estimate a regression model in which the probability of failure formally depends upon a set of
explanatory variables. We extend the scope of our analysis to include firm-specific, industry-level
and macroeconomic influences on the failure rate. While retaining a focus on certain industry-level
characteristics (i.e., concentration and turnover), we investigate the impact of two firm-specific
factors—size and age—on the hazard. In addition, this model controls for geographic and industryspecific variation in the failure rate.
Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

<-----Page 16----->•

Using our regression framework, we investigate differences in the likelihood of survival across
individual provinces and industries. These provide a useful complement to the aggregate survival
rates reported in Chapter 3. In addition, we examine changes in survival rates brought about by
variation in certain factors—relative measures of firm size, age, the intensity of competition, and
economic growth.

•

We revisit our earlier focus on the relation between age and the failure rate. In order to compare the
determinants of failure at different stages of the entrant’s lifecycle, we estimate a hazard rate model
for new firms in their first and fifth years of life. We then examine differences in survival rates
across individual provinces and industries, and evaluate the quantitative impact of changes in firm
size, competition and economic growth.

•

As a final exercise, we examine the relation between the timing of entry and the failure rate.
Focusing on newborn firms, we estimate a hazard rate model that examines the determinants of
failure across two entry periods: the 1980s and the 1990s. We then evaluate the impact of changes in
relative efficiency and competitive intensity, and examine inter-provincial and inter-industry
variation in the survival rate.

We conclude in Chapter 8 by reviewing the central findings of the study. Additional tabulations as well
as supplementary discussion on measurement and methods are presented in appendix form.

O

ur tabulations are based on a Statistics Canada database—the Longitudinal Employment Analysis
Program (LEAP). LEAP is a company-level database that includes all employers in Canada, both
corporate and unincorporated.2 This database tracks the employment and payroll characteristics of
individual firms from their year of entry to their year of exit.
The identification of new businesses on LEAP is based on payroll deduction accounts. Every employer is
required to register a payroll deduction account and issue a T4 slip to each employee that summarizes
earnings received in a given fiscal year. The LEAP database includes every business that issues a T4
taxation slip. For each business, annual estimates of total payroll and employment are calculated.3 The
latter, used extensively in this analysis, is an average count of employees within the firm, and does not
distinguish between full-time and part-time workers. This payroll and employment information is then
organized longitudinally, that is, each observation on the database corresponds to a particular firm whose
employment, payroll and industry characteristics are recorded at different points in time.
The longitudinal nature of LEAP allows entry and exit times to be measured with precision. Entrants (or
‘births’) in any given year are firms that have current payroll data, but that did not have payroll data in
the previous year. Similarly, exits (or ‘deaths’) in any given year are identified by the absence of current
payroll data, where such data had existed in the previous year.4 While seemingly straightforward,
obtaining accurate measurements of births and deaths is not a trivial task. The creation of the LEAP
database requires considerable effort in distinguishing ‘real’ births and deaths from ‘false’ ones. Real
births and deaths reflect actual entry and exit events (the creation of new firms and the failure of existing
ones); false births and deaths may simply reflect organizational restructuring within a firm, or a change
in its reporting practices. These false births and deaths are identified, and then corrected on the file,
using a method of ‘labour tracking’.5 This approach essentially tracks workers as they move from
company to company from one year to the next. If a new firm (or birth) contains a large majority of
employees from a ‘death’ in the previous year, then the status of this death and birth is subject to
verification. In cases where a birth and death share the same (or a similar) name, or the same payroll
deduction account(s), this birth and death is reclassified as a continuing business.6
LEAP has traditionally been used to support research on employment dynamics. Picot, Baldwin and
Dupuy (1994) and Picot and Dupuy (1996) examined job creation and loss within small and large firms.
This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of survival and failure rates within the Canadian
economy based on LEAP data.
The LEAP database is, in organizational terms, comprised of two distinct datafiles—a ‘national’ datafile
and a ‘provincial’ datafile. Each is updated regularly to incorporate the most current employment and
2

The self-employed that do not draw a salary are not included on the LEAP database. In addition, businesses comprised
solely of individuals or partnerships who do not draw a salary are also excluded from LEAP.
3
The basic unit of employment in the LEAP database is an ALU or ‘Average Labour Unit’. For additional background on
LEAP, see Picot and Dupuy (1996, Appendix 1).
4
This allows us to ascertain that a firm that exists in year i but not i + 1 has exited some time in year i.

<-----Page 19----->payroll information on individual firms. The national datafile contains no information on a firm’s
province(s) of operation, which is maintained separately on the provincial file. This national/provincial
distinction has important implications for the profile of entry and exit developed herein, as we draw
extensively from both datafiles. The majority of our tabulations in Chapters 3-6 are based on the national
file.7 New entrants on this file are firms that commence operations anywhere in Canada. These are firms
that are ‘new’ to Canada, irrespective of whether they established their operations in British Columbia,
Newfoundland or any other province or territory.
Our multivariate analysis in Chapter 7 is, by contrast, based primarily on the provincial datafile—as one
of our principal objectives at this stage is to examine differences in failure rates across provinces, while
simultaneously accounting for a multitude of factors that, we posit, directly influence the hazard rate.8
Unlike the national file, new entrants on the provincial file refer to businesses that are ‘new’ to a
particular province. This means that certain businesses, those with operations in more than one province,
will appear on the file more than once (as separate units). For example, a firm with longstanding
operations in Ontario may establish new operations in Quebec. These new operations will trigger a birth
in Quebec, apart from the earlier activities of the firm in Ontario. Similarly, the cessation of these new
operations will trigger a death in Quebec, while the firm remains in operation in Ontario.
We outline several data issues below—those that pertain directly to the scope of our analysis. While
these points are addressed in the ensuing text, they are worthy of emphasis here.
•

Our focus is on new firms in commercial industries (that is, on entry driven by the profit motive).
We exclude from the analysis all entrants in public, quasi-public and not-for-profit industries. These
include new firms classified to government services, educational services, health and social services,
and non-profit organizations.9

•

Our analysis is based on new firms that entered the market over the 1984-1994 period. As entry and
exit are measured in annual units, this observation period comprises eleven separate entry periods,
and hence, eleven different cohort groups. Our choice of observation period is governed by data
considerations. At the time of writing, all entrants on the national file were right-censored in 1995.10
We modify this observation period slightly when conducting our multivariate analysis based on the
provincial file. Here we are able to add one year to our observation period, as right-censoring occurs
in 1996.

7

One exception to this is the provincial survival rates reported in Table 5.
The samples used for the regression analysis derive from the provincial file; that said, certain explanatory variables in this
analysis are calculated from the national file.
9
The non-profit sector is comprised of enterprises classified as membership organizations. In addition to the above sectors—
each of which is excluded on the grounds that its economic activity is largely non-commercial in nature—we removed firms
classified to Deposit Accepting Intermediary Industries from the subsequent analysis because of data limitations.
10
That is, as of 1995, we are unable to distinguish between exits and continuing firms, because we lack 1996 data to ascertain
which of firms alive in 1995 exit by the following year.

or the majority of new firms, life is short and uncertain. Most entrants exit shortly after birth. About
one in five new firms survive to their tenth birthday. This process of entry and failure is costly, both
in dollar terms and in the time-costs borne by entrepreneurs. One may view this process as the
investment that the market economy makes in finding the goods and services that consumers demand. It
can also be regarded as an investment in managerial experience, as some of the entrepreneurs who fail
will learn from their experiences and go on to found businesses that eventually succeed.
Entry rates by industry sector are reported in Table 1.11 New firms, on average, accounted for 16% of the
overall business population over the 1984-1994 period. Entry is more pronounced in the services sector
(17%) than in the goods sector (15%).

<-----Page 21----->Among goods-producing industries, logging and forestry (21%) and fishing and trapping (17%) exhibit
the highest rates of entry. New firms are least prevalent in manufacturing (12%). Among servicesproviding industries, the highest rates occur in other services12 (23%), accommodation, food and
beverage (18%), and finance and insurance (17%). Relatively low rates of entry are evident for retail
trade (14%), real estate operators and insurance agents (13%) and wholesale trade (12%).
The ultimate importance of entrants is determined not only by their rate of birth, but also by the rate at
which they exit. Exit rates report, for a specific period, the ratio of failures to the total entrant
population. However, as failure may occur at different times and at different rates across particular
classes of firms, it is useful to represent the relation between entry and exit using two distinct measures
of probability: the survivor and hazard functions. The survivor function, S ( j ) , specifies the probability
that a unit from a population of entrants will have a lifetime in excess of duration ( j ) .13 In a
nonparametric framework, the survivor function takes the form:
j

S ( j ) = ∏ ( ni − d i ) / ni
i =1

where d i is the number of failures at age (i ) and ni is the population of firms at risk just prior to (i ) .14 A
related measure is given by the hazard function, h(i ) , which specifies the probability that failure will
occur at age (i ) , given that the risk of failure still exists at (i ) . The hazard rate is calculated by taking
the ratio of the number of exits to the number of firms at risk at age (i ) , that is,
di
h(i ) = .
ni
The survivor function can thus be expressed in terms of the hazard function:
j

S ( j ) = ∏ (1 − hi ) .
i =1

Survival and hazard rates for firms that entered commercial industries over the 1984-1994 period are
reported in Table 2.15

12

This industry sector is comprised of amusement and recreational services, as well as personal and household services,
among others.
13
Thus, the survivor function is simply the counterpart to the conventional distribution function, F ( j ) , which specifies the
probability that a unit from the population will have a lifetime less than or equal to ( j ) . Note that definitions for survivor and
distribution functions are often modified in terms of the equality condition; alternatively, the former gives the probability that
a lifetime is equal to or greater than ( j ) and the latter defines the probability that a lifetime is less than ( j ) . Kiefer (1988)
provides an illuminating discussion of distributions within the context of survival analysis.
14
This is the standard product-limit estimator of the survivor function. For discussion, see Cox (1972), Kalbfleisch and
Prentice (1980), and Lawless (1982). Much of our discussion is based on Kiefer (1988).
15
A note on our terminology: we use the terms survival rate and survivor function interchangeably. In both cases, we are
referring to the latter – the probability of surviving beyond a particular age. We adopt a similar convention for describing the
hazard rate, often referring to the hazard simply as the failure rate. In either case, this is the likelihood of failure, given that
the possibility of failure still exists. Note that detailed survival and hazard rates are reported in the appendices – including
geography-by-industry combinations (Appendix B) and geography-by-firm size combinations (Appendix C).

<-----Page 22----->Each of these survival rates gives the probability that a new firm will live beyond a certain age. A new
firm has a 77% likelihood of surviving beyond its first year, a 36% probability of surviving past its fifth
year, and a 20% likelihood of completing its first decade. By comparison, each of the hazard rates
represents the likelihood of failure at a particular age—conditional upon the risk of failure still existing.
Accordingly, a new firm that is still in business just prior to its second year has a 22% likelihood of
failing during its second year. An entrant that remains in business prior to its fifth year has only a 14%
chance of failing during this year.

<-----Page 23----->Among goods-producing industries, early-period survival rates are highest in manufacturing and mining
(Table 3). Firms in these sectors have a 68% and 67% likelihood of surviving beyond their second year,
respectively. In later years, new manufacturing firms are still better off; a manufacturing entrant has a
33% probability of surviving beyond eight years.
In the services sector (Table 4), new firms in wholesale trade, real estate and insurance, finance and
insurance, and business services have relatively high survival rates at two years (67%-69%), about the
same as entrants in manufacturing industries. While firms in these industries continue to do better than
the services average, those in wholesale trade maintain the highest survival rate in later stages of life. At
the other extreme, new firms in the accommodation, food and beverage industry have some of the lowest
survival rates. Here entrants have only a 60% chance of surviving beyond their second year and only a
22% chance of surviving beyond eight years. The latter probability is a good 12% less than wholesale
industries and 9% less than business services. Firms in the residual group of ‘other services’—including
personal and household services—have an even lower likelihood of surviving beyond eight years (16%).

The survival rates of new firms vary substantially across Canadian provinces (Table 5). Entrants in
Ontario have the highest probability of surviving beyond their second year (63%). Roughly six in ten
new firms in Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia reach this milestone. Second year survival rates are
slightly lower in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, at 55% and 54% respectively. Business failures in very
young firms are more apparent in the Atlantic Provinces. Just over four in ten new firms in
Newfoundland survive beyond their second birthday.
Differences in survival rates across provinces are also evident in the longer term. Roughly one in four
new firms in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia survive beyond their eighth birthday. For
the Atlantic Provinces, Newfoundland excepted, the likelihood of doing so declines to one in five.

22

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

<-----Page 24----->The reasons that new firms in some provinces fare better than those in others are varied and complex. In
the first instance, differences in aggregate survival rates may mirror underlying differences in size
characteristics and/or industry composition. If, for example, survival is positively correlated with firm
size, provinces with relatively high shares of larger entrants, will, other things equal, tend ‘to produce’
more survivors. Differences in the industry mix between provinces will also affect survival rates.
Finally, institutional factors or differences in policy regimes may prove consequential. All of this
suggests that a systematic study of failure rates requires an underlying framework. It is to this that we
now turn.

T

he interest in exploring the post-entry performance of new firms stems from the important role that
entrants play. Entrants are seen as a positive force in most industries. They serve as the conduit
through which new ideas are introduced (Audretsch, 1995). They are seen as a primary force that
equilibrates industry profits (Geroski, 1991). The death of entrants, on the other hand, reduces these
beneficial effects. It is for this reason that the factors that allow firms in certain industries to survive at
higher rates than in others are worthy of investigation. Two factors have been posited to affect the
survival rates of new firms. First, inter-industry variability in post-entry performance may be due to
differences in competitive conditions. Second, the underlying costs of entry may condition differences in
survival rates. Most studies of failure rates provide little in the way of a formal model. Often, the hazard
is simply regressed on a series of variables, each of which is posited to affect the probability of exit in
some way. In what follows, we first offer a conceptual framework—a stylized model of the entry and
exit process.
4.1 A Model of Entry and Exit

To investigate the factors associated with survival, consider a basic model in which the quantity of entry,
N , and the probability of survival, p , are determined by the interaction of two forces. The first of these
is a supply curve that captures the relationship between the number of entrants and the probability of
survival. To derive this supply curve, we posit a profit function for a representative entrant of the form:
PR = R − C (E )

where R equals revenue and C ( E ) is the cost function. Entry decisions will depend upon the level of
expected profit, ( π ). This, in turn, is a function of profits, PR , the probability of success, p , and the
losses, L , that will occur if the firm fails:

π = E ( PR) = p * PR + (1 − p ) * L
Losses are the costs of entry that are not recouped upon failure. They consist of sunk costs of capital and
equipment, other investments that are made at the pre-entry stage, and losses that occur after entry prior
to failure.
The aggregate supply curve of entrants is derived from the entry decisions of individual firms. Each of
these can be modelled as an investment decision based on expected profits. Consider a world where
capabilities differ. Some entrants will do quite well after entry because of their superior capabilities,
while others will fail because of their inferior capabilities. In a world where expectations differ, some
potential entrants will have high expectations of profitability. They will enter when the probability of
success is lower. Others, because their expectations of their own capabilities are less, only enter when
the probability of success increases. These differences will trace out the supply curve S1 in Figure 1,
which is positively sloped in the probability of success p . The location of this curve will depend on
expected profits ( π ).
Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

25

<-----Page 27----->The second determinant of entry and success is a constraint C that determines the amount of ‘market
room’ or ‘demand’ for entry. We represent this as the downward sloping curve in Figure 1. This
constraint recognizes that all markets are finite and that the larger the entry pool, the less likely any one
entrant will survive. It leads to an inverse relationship between the number of entrants and the
probability of survival. In the simplest of worlds, where entry satisfies new demand and there is only
enough room for one firm, this market constraint will trace out a rectangular hyperbola, that is,
N = 1/ p .

In Figure 1, market equilibrium occurs at p1 and N1 .

Probability of survival

Hazard models, which calculate p as a function of certain industry characteristics, implicitly assume a
system such as that represented in Figure 1.17 Let us now consider what this model reveals about the
relationship between the likelihood of survival (or failure) and certain market characteristics.
Since the supply curve is determined by the level of π , changes in expected profit will cause the supply
curve to shift. Expected profits in the current framework are partially endogenous. They depend on both
revenues and costs. Part of these costs involves information acquisition. Firms need to invest in market
information, capital equipment, and human capital. In addition, they have to make basic expenditures to
forecast their probability of success. Some of these costs can be incurred prior to entry. Others are
incurred after entry.
In Jovanovic’s (1982) model of selection, the success of a firm depends principally on its relative
efficiency, the state of which is unknown prior to entry. Only after taking the decision to enter will the
firm learn of its relative competency. Thus “the efficient grow and survive; the inefficient decline and
fail.”18 Baldwin and Rafiquzzaman (1995) demonstrate that entrants in manufacturing that fail are
indeed the least efficient.

17

A simplified version of this model would set expected profits equal to zero with p (the survival rate) adjusting to maintain
this equilibrium condition. In this simplified model, the S curve becomes perfectly inelastic at p1.
18
See Jovanovic (1982: 649).
26

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

<-----Page 28----->By evaluating its managerial capabilities via this process, a firm risks potential losses L . This is a form
of investment in information acquisition, the gains from which are lost if the firm fails. These costs will
be relatively minor when there are few sunk costs, that is, when the extraction costs of an entrepreneur’s
investment are relatively low. When this is the case, there will be more of this form of information
acquisition and concomitantly more entry.
In our framework, if one assumes a constant value for R , expected profit varies with the cost of entry
experimentation. Where these costs are low, so is L and the higher is π. Market factors that signal a
decrease in the cost of experimentation—for example, by reducing the initial costs of entry—will shift
the S curve upwards, as greater numbers of new firms take the entry gamble at a given level of p . As
seen in Figure 2, this reduces the equilibrium probability of survival from p1 to p 2 . We therefore
expect a positive relationship between the likelihood of survival and the costs of experimentation. Lower
experimentation costs will lead to a lower survival rate.

Probability of survival

Whereas profit conditions affect the position of the supply curve, the location of the constraint is
determined by the competitive conditions of the industry. More generally, the position of the constraint
will be determined by how much ‘market room’ there is for new firms. This will depend upon the
industry’s competitive environment. Adopting the life-cycle model (Abernathy and Utterbach, 1978;
Rothwell and Zegveld, 1982; Gort and Klepper, 1982), we can posit that there exists considerable room
for entrants in the early stages of an industry’s life cycle. In these stages, new ideas are much more
successful. It is only later in the industry life cycle that it becomes more difficult for entrants to survive,
partially because firm sizes increase and it is more difficult for entrants to master all the skills that are
required in larger firms immediately upon start-up. It is also at this stage that industries become more
concentrated and the reaction of incumbent oligopolists to entrants may lead to a lower likelihood of
success for a given number of new firms. We would therefore expect the C curve to be to the right in
the early stages of an industry—with higher levels of both N and p . On the other hand, we would
expect that the constraint would be to the left in more mature industries, with lower levels of both N
and p . This may prove untrue, however, if the supply behaviour of entrants is also influenced by an
industry’s lifecycle. For instance, it may be that mature industries have higher failure costs, if in fact

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

27

<-----Page 29----->sunk costs are high. This reduces the number of actual entrants, seen here as a downward shift in the
S curve, and leads to an increase in the equilibrium survival rate.
Changes in the intensity of competition will also affect the position of the market constraint, and hence,
equilibrium N and p —though not in ways that are obvious a priori. On one hand, more competition
will effect a leftward shift in the constraint curve. In this context, a more competitive market is less
forgiving, and leads to more failure. This reduces the equilibrium levels of N and p , as seen in Figure
3. On the other hand, greater competition often gives rise to a more dynamic marketplace, and may
actually create additional market space for new young firms. Entrants in dynamic markets may be more
able to capitalize on new product ideas and production technologies, which in turn may afford them
some advantage (at least in the short run) over competitor firms. These offsetting ‘congestion’ effects
aside, changes in the intensity of competition may also influence expected profits, and hence the supply
decisions of entrants. Accordingly, the net effect of competition on the survival rate can only be
ascertained via empirical analysis.

4.2 The Role of Industry Environment

We describe below a set of industry characteristics that, we posit, determine either the position of the
supply curve or the market constraint. Two variables—average firm size and average size of entrant—are
directly related to the cost of market experimentation. Another two—the concentration ratio and the rate
of job turnover—are measures of the intensity of the competitive process. The relation of our final
variable—the rate of entry—to the survival rate will depend on whether the market constraint or the
supply curve varies more across industries.
Average Firm Size
In our framework, average size is taken as a proxy for the costs of market experimentation. The greater
the average firm size within an industry, the more pronounced the input costs associated with the entry
gamble. If a given percentage of costs are sunk, and thus irrecoverable in the event of failure, average
firm size will be positively correlated with the amount that will be lost should failure occur. In a similar
vein, average firm size can be seen as closely related to the barriers associated with scale, or financing
costs, all of which increase the costs of entry. This will cause post-entry search costs to increase and will

<-----Page 30----->effect a downward shift in the entrant supply function. In turn, this will decrease the number of entrants
in equilibrium and increase their likelihood of survival.
Average Entrant Size
As an alternative measure of size, average entrant size provides a more direct measure of the cost
conditions facing new firms at the time of the entry decision. Upon failure, small entrants can expect to
make fewer losses than large firms, as the former are less likely to incur sunk costs associated with inter
alia scale or financing requirements. Lower experimentation costs will, in turn, encourage more firms to
take the entry gamble. Hence, an increase in average entrant size shifts the S curve downwards, thereby
increasing the survival rate.
Industry Concentration
Concentration ratios are often used as a proxy for the intensity of competition within a given industry. A
concentrated industry, in which output is generated by a relatively small number of firms, suggests a
correspondingly lower level of competition than that expected in industries where output shares are more
equally distributed.

If less competition among incumbents also means that entrants face less competition, an increase in
industry concentration serves to shift the market constraint rightwards, thereby increasing both the
number of entrants and the probability of survival in equilibrium. On the other hand, if more
concentration leads to more reaction by incumbents, the market room curve will shift to the left resulting
in less entry and lower survival. And if concentration is associated with high experimentation costs due
to sunk costs, this shifts the supply curve to the right and leads, other things equal, to less entry and
higher survival. The effect of concentration on the post-entry performance of entrants in equilibrium is
therefore ambiguous.
Rate of Job Turnover
An alternate measure of the intensity of competition within an industry is given by the rate of turnover.
The rate of turnover captures the extent to which resources are being transferred from one firm to
another. As Baldwin and Gorecki (1994) argue, the rate of turnover is a more direct measure of
competition than are concentration ratios. The latter depict the overall firm size distribution but do not
capture the degree to which firms are shifting position as a result of competition. Turnover more directly
captures this phenomenon. In general, high rates of turnover suggest the presence of a volatile
marketplace, characterized by unstable market shares brought on by the continual reorganization of
competitor firms. Baldwin (1995) demonstrates that these are industries where profits return to normal
more quickly when exogenous forces cause short run disequilibrium. Industries with considerable
turnover are also those for which the parameters of competition are quite dynamic in nature, as
evidenced by relatively high levels of innovation and technological change.

The effect of turnover on the failure rate of new firms is, like concentration, somewhat ambiguous a
priori. On the one hand, an increase in the rate of turnover suggest that all firms, both entrants and
incumbents, face more competition, and hence are more likely to fail, other things equal. We can
represent this in our framework as a leftward shift in the constraint, or market room curve, leading to a
decrease in the entrant survival rate. On the other hand, an increase in turnover may create more, not
less, room for new firms if volatile markets create new niche opportunities.

<-----Page 31----->Rate of Entry
Relative movements in the supply and market room curves will determine the relationship between the
rate of entry and the survival rate. If the supply curve is constant and only the market room curve shifts
due to changes in competitive conditions, then changes in equilibrium levels of entry and the probability
of entrant survival will be positively related. On the other hand, if the market room conditions are
constant, and there are differences across industries in the supply behaviour of entrants, then changes in
equilibrium levels of entry and the probability of survival will be inversely correlated. When both the
technical constraint and the supply curve vary, their relative volatility will determine the relationship
between N and p .19
4.3 Defining Industry Clusters

To investigate these issues empirically, we propose the following method. For each industry variable, all
3-digit industries are rank-ordered and stratified into terciles, corresponding to high/large, medium, and
low/small industry clusters, respectively.20 In all cases, the ranking order is derived by calculating a
weighted average over the period under study; that is, for each industry, a single value is calculated using
information from all applicable years.21 Our set of industry variables are defined below:

åE
Average firm size =
åF

i

i

i

i

where E i denotes total industry employment and Fi is the number of businesses. The time period is
i =1983,...,1994.

åE
Average entrant size =
åF

e
i

i

e

i

i

where E ie is the employment of entrants and Fi e is the number of new firms within the industry,
respectively. Years range from i =1984,…,1995.

å E*
Concentration ratio =
åE

i

i

i

i

where E *i is the employment of the four largest firms in the industry and E i is total industry
employment. In this case, i =1983,…,1994.

19

This is equivalent to the question of identification in a supply and demand model.
Note that in certain cases LEAP industries are aggregates of 3-digit industries.
21
For example, for a given industry, entry rates are tabulated using the sum of births across all years divided by the sum of
enterprises in all years. An alternative technique, not utilized here, is to simply take the arithmetic mean of the yearly rates.
Given our view that there exists little volatility in each of our industry characteristics from year to year, the former method
should suffice for the present exercise.

Minimum and maximum values for the various industry clusters are presented in Table 6. Each tercile
(or cluster) contains just under 70 industries, and represents one-third of all commercial industries on the
LEAP database. On this, one issue warrants special emphasis: While terciles contain equal numbers of
industries, they do not represent ‘equal groupings’ of firms, as the number of firms, new or otherwise,
varies substantially from industry-to-industry. Accordingly, the number of firms in the ‘medium’ group
of industries may, for example, be substantially more (or less) than the number of firms in either the
‘small’ or ‘large’ industry groups. In what follows, we examine how survival and hazard rates differ
across these industry clusters.

<-----Page 33-----><-----Page 34----->Chapter 5 –Survival and Failure
5.1 Survival and Hazard Curves

We present our empirical results below. Our basic measure of duration, or survival time, is:

Duration = (death year – birth year) + 1. 26
The maximum age for new firms under study is 11. Survival and hazard rates for the first set of industry
clusters—ordered by average firm size (AFS) —are presented in Figures 4 and 5. 27
Survival rates are correlated with an industry’s firm size characteristics. Survival rates increase
monotonically across the three industry clusters (from small-size industries to large-size industries).
This, in turn, suggests that the costs of experimentation vary in accordance with firm size.
Differences in hazard rates across industry clusters become apparent in the initial year of life. Entrants in
industries with small firm size characteristics have a much higher hazard in their first year. Beyond this
point, hazard rates across the small- and medium-size clusters are virtually identical. In contrast, new
firms in industries with large firm size characteristics have lower hazard rates at every duration.
It is also noteworthy that hazard rates increase from the first to the second year for entrants in both the
medium and large size classes, but not for those in the smaller size class. The former provides some
evidence of a ‘honeymoon effect’—the notion that the firm’s initial stock of assets will afford it some
insurance against failure in early infancy. This effect is at work in the larger not the smaller size classes.
Hence, failure rates for the larger firms are not expected to be at their highest in the first period of life—
rather, they will reach a maximum at the point where initial assets are depleted (seen here as year 2) only
to decline thereafter (Fichman and Levinthal, 1991). The existence of a honeymoon effect aside, our
results do suggest that differences in failure rates are more substantial in the early years of life than in
subsequent periods.28

26

As exits cannot be identified in the terminal year, firms for which 1995 payroll data exist are, by definition, right-censored.
Note that product-limit estimates are generally plotted as a step function. For ease of presentation, we plot our survival rates
as a continuous curve. It should be noted, however, that these rates remain constant between durations and do not descend on
a continuous scale. As such, valid point estimates occur only at discrete duration times. Survival and hazard rates for each of
our industry clusters are presented in tabular form in Appendix A.
28
Previous studies have found evidence of declining hazards over time; see (e.g.) Audretsch (1991) and Baldwin (1995). For
a discussion of these studies, see Caves (1998).

<-----Page 37----->Ranking industries on the basis of average entrant size also reveals monotonic differences across the
three industry clusters (low/medium/large). Once again, the survival rate of new firms is lower among
industries with smaller firm sizes. New firms in industries with larger entrant sizes exhibit higher
survival rates than those in the medium size range (Figure 6). Failure rates are everywhere lower in
large-size industries (Figure 7). While a high first-year hazard in the small size cluster is apparent, once
beyond this initial year, failure rates in small and medium size industries are again nearly equivalent. As
before, hazard rates increase between years one and two in industries with medium and larger entrant
sizes.
We now turn to address two conventional measures of market competition—concentration and turnover.
Figures 8 and 9 report survival and hazard rates for industry clusters ranked by the degree of
concentration. At first blush, there is little relationship between industry concentration and survival rates
for new firms. That said, new firms in highly concentrated industries do have a slightly lower failure rate
in their first year (Figure 9).
The fact that survival rates do not increase (or decrease) monotonically from more to less concentrated
industries suggests that the impact of concentration on failure is not straightforward. A relatively low
first-year failure rate in more concentrated industries suggests that incumbent response plays a minor
role at start-up, and that very young firms benefit from less competition. Beyond this stage, however,
concentration appears to have little effect on failure.

The results for job turnover (Figures 10 and 11) are similar to those for concentration in that our industry
rankings produce no strong monotonic relationship. Entrants in industries with higher rates of job
turnover (among continuing firms) do exhibit slightly lower survival rates than new firms in other
industries (Figure 10) owing, once again, to a higher hazard rate in the first year (Figure 11). This
suggests that very young firms are more adversely affected by a volatile marketplace. Beyond the first
year, however, differences in failure rates are negligible.

The results of our industry analysis suggest that intersectoral differences in firm size requirements bring
about more variation in survival rates than do those associated with concentration and turnover. In our
framework, this suggests that cross-industry variation in the supply curve (the position of which is
influenced via changes in the costs of experimentation) is more apparent than cross-industry variation in
the market room curve (the position of which is determined by changes in competitive intensity). In turn,
we can expect a negative correlation between entry rates and survival rates for new firms. Survival and
hazard rates across entry groupings are plotted in Figures 12 and 13.

The results confirm the positive correlation between entry and failure. This is true for entrants with
different age profiles. A new firm in a high-entry industry has a 76% likelihood of surviving beyond its
first year; this increases to 80% for entrants in medium-entry industries, and to 86% for new firms in
low-entry industries. Calculated in year five, these probabilities stand at 33%, 40%, and 50% for high-,
medium- and low-entry sectors, respectively. As seen in Figure 13, cross-industry differences in failure
rates are more apparent in early years of life. These become less apparent in subsequent periods,
although hazards in low-entry industries do remain consistently lower than those in other industries over
the entire time period studied here.
It is noteworthy that cross-industry variation in hazard rates is most pronounced in early stages of life. It
is in these years that the greatest disparity exists between the most and the least efficient firms, as the
market has not yet had time to cull out the latter. Once this occurs, and as the remaining entrants mature,
there is less variability in failure rates, as there is less disparity in operating efficiencies among the
remaining population.

5.2 Length of Life Estimates

Survival and hazard curves constitute a useful first basis for inquiry. Both represent a locus of
probability estimates calculated over a number of years. But these need to be supplemented with more
parsimonious summary statistics in order to characterize differences in the exit process across industries.
In this chapter, we use information on survival and hazard rates to estimate two such measures: the mean
and median lifetime of new firms.

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

39

<-----Page 41----->Mean Length of Life
To estimate average survival time for each of our industry clusters, we assume that the survival data
follow a Weibull distribution.29 A two-parameter distribution, hazard and survivor functions for the
Weibull are defined as:

h(t ) = γα (γt ) α −1
and

S (t ) = exp[ − (γt ) α ]
where ( γ > 0) and ( α > 0 ).
Taking the natural logarithm of the Weibull survivor function and multiplying by (-1) yields:
− log( S ) = (γt ) α .
Transforming this into linear form, we have:
log[ − log( s)] = α [log γ + log t ] .

Accordingly, an OLS regression of the form:
y = a + bx + u

will yield estimates of the Weibull parameters where:

γ = exp( a / α )
and

α = b .30

The average length of life can then be recovered from the Weibull parameters by taking:
1
Γ[(α + 1) / α ] .31
γ

29

The Weibull distribution is generally used in practice in light of its convenient mathematical form. Standard plotting
techniques provide some support for a Weibull – see Appendix F.
30
For a useful discussion, see Lawless (1982).
31
We include the following sample calculation of mean survival time. Hastings and Peacock (1975) write the Weibull
survivor function for a random variable ( x ) as

S ( x ) = exp[ − ( x / b) c ]
where b is the scale parameter and
distribution is
bΓ[( c + 1) / c] .
In our notation, the scale parameter

γ

c denotes the shape parameter. The corresponding expression for the mean of the

New firms have short expected lives. In our sample, the average length of life for new firms across all
industries is about 6 years. Estimates of survival time vary sensibly across each of our industry clusters.
For example, new firms in industries with high rates of entry have an average length of life (5.4 years)
that is roughly one-half that of entrants in low-entry industries (9.1 years). As expected, average entrant
size (ASE) and average firm size (AFS) are positively correlated with survival time. Differences in
average survival time are not strongly related to changes in competitive intensity—as measured by
concentration (CONC) and turnover (TURN).
Median Length of Life

The Weibull survivor function can also be used to estimate median duration time—a measure of central
tendency that is less influenced by outliers. Once again, this survivor function takes the form:

S (t ) = exp[ − (γt ) α ]
Transforming this into linear form and solving for log ( t ) yields:
log( t ) = c + d log[ − log S ( t )]

where
c = − log γ

and
d =1/α .

Estimating the parameters ( c, d ) via an OLS regression yields a vector of predicted values for log ( t ) .

where α = c . To illustrate, our least squares estimates of α and γ for the low entry-rate class of industries are 0.829 and
0.122, respectively. Substituting these values into the above expression yields a mean of 9.06 which, then, is the average
survival time for new firms in low-entry industries based on the Weibull distribution.
Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

41

<-----Page 43----->At the median survival time:
log[ − log S (t )] ≡ log[ − log(0.5)] .32

Thus, the predicted value of log ( t ) evaluated at log[ − log(0.5)] is the median value of log duration.
Taking the antilog of the median converts the estimate to its appropriate time-scale.
Estimates of median survival time are reported for each of our industry clusters in Table 8. As might be
expected from the skewness in the distribution of survival times (the preponderance of entrants die
young, only a small percentage live for a long period), the median estimates reported in Table 8 are
considerably lower than the means reported in Table 7. On average, the median survival time is roughly
3 years, while the mean is about 6 years.

Differences in median survival time across industry clusters are generally consistent with the survival
rates reported in Section 5.1.33 New firms in industries with high entry rates exhibit a lower median
survival time (2.9 years) than those in the medium and low entry-rate sectors. We again observe a
monotonic relationship between firm size and survival time (AFS and ASE). Median survival time is not
clearly related to either concentration (CONC) or turnover (TURN). This said, new firms in industries
with high rates of job turnover do have shorter median lives than those in other industries. This result
suggests that turnover captures differences in the intensity of competition, but that its effect is more
evident in early years of life, which is consistent with the hazard rates presented in Figure 11.

32

To see this, recall that a survivor function value of 0.5 at duration

( t ) indicates that a given unit from the population has a

( t ) ; similarly, the median of a continuous frequency distribution is just
the value of the random variable ( x ) such that an observation has a 50% probability of being greater than ( x ) .

50% probability of surviving in excess of duration

Note that, while differences between nonparametric and Weibull medians do exist, they are generally slight.

<-----Page 44----->Chapter 6 –The Risk of Failure:
New Start-Ups versus Adolescents

I

n Chapter 5, we found that firm size characteristics, our proxies for the costs of entry experimentation,
give rise to more inter-industry variation in survival rates than do our measures of competitive
intensity, concentration and turnover. In all cases, when industry characteristics matter, they matter most
in early periods, as indicated by relatively large differences in first-year hazard rates. During infancy,
new firms still differ substantially in terms of their efficiency characteristics and culling is relatively
more important.
In what follows, we formally examine differences in relative risk among infant firms (new businesses in
their first two years of life) and then among adolescents (firms that are 5 to 7 years old). Our motivation
for doing so is to ascertain whether differences in failure rates persist beyond the short run.
To investigate this, we define average hazard rates during infancy and adolescence. Denote these
respectively as:

h(1,2) ij
and
h(5,7) ij
where the parenthetical expression indicates the age cohorts used to calculate the average, the superscript
i denotes an industry cluster (e.g., small) and the subscript j represents an industry characteristic (e.g.,
average firm size). Average hazards in infancy, h(1,2) ij , are thus defined for any combination of i and j
as the ratio of total deaths in years 1 and 2 to the total number of firms at risk during years 1 and 2.
Average hazards in adolescence are similarly calculated for years 5 through 7 inclusive. For any industry
characteristic j , we can define a series of risk differentials during infancy as:
h(1,2) mj − h(1,2) lj
h(1,2) hj − h(1,2) mj
h(1,2) hj − h(1,2) lj
where the superscripts l , m , and h denote low/small, medium, and high/large industry clusters,
respectively. A risk differential thus measures the probability difference in average hazard rates between
different groups of industries at a particular point in the lifecycle. For adolescents, these become:
h(5,7) mj − h(5,7) lj
h(5,7) hj − h(5,7) mj
h(5,7) hj − h(5,7) lj .

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

43

<-----Page 45----->Each of the above hazard-rate differentials represents competing population proportions. For the purpose
of illustration, let j equal the rate of entry. To test whether the hazard in medium-entry industries differs
from the hazard in low-entry industries34, we evaluate the null
H o : h(1,2) mj − h(1,2) lj = 0.
To do so, we require an estimate of the pooled hazard based on industry classes l and m .
We can define this pooled estimate as

The above results allow us to examine cross-sectoral variation in failure rates among infant firms. New
business start-ups in industries with medium rates of entry exhibit, on average, a 4.8% greater hazard
rate than infants in low-entry industries. This gap in relative hazards increases to 9.2% in a comparison
between high and low entry rate sectors. When industry clusters are based on entrant size (ASE), infants
in industries with small entrants exhibit, on average, a 6.7% greater hazard than those in industries with
large entrants. By way of contrast, differences in infant failure rates between the most and least
concentrated sectors are only half as large.
We now turn to examine differences in relative risk during adolescence. Risk differentials are reported in
Table 10.
Except for a strong correlation between entry and failure, only slight differences in relative risk exist
among adolescent firms. While often statistically different from zero, the magnitude of these risk
differentials in qualitative terms is not substantial. Emerging firms in industries with large entrant sizes
have a 2.5% lower failure rate than adolescents in industries with small entrant sizes. Differences based
on concentration or turnover are even less apparent. These results suggest that certain aspects of industry
structure that may be correlated with failure are less consequential among firms that have survived to
adolescence.

<-----Page 48----->Chapter 7 – Investigating the Determinants of Failure:
A Multivariate Approach

W

e have explored several themes in previous sections. First, industry characteristics that proxy the
costs of market experimentation—average firm size and average entrant size—play a greater role
in conditioning the exit process than do variables that determine the amount of market room—such as
turnover and concentration. As our conceptual framework suggests, this leads to an inverse relationship
between the rate at which firms enter the marketplace and aggregate survival rates; higher entry, simply
stated, gives rise to more failure. In Chapter 5, we presented these results in several ways—using, first,
plots of survival and hazard rates and, second, estimates of mean and median lifetimes. A second major
theme—introduced in our discussion of survival and hazard curves, and developed more fully in our
examination of risk differentials in Chapter 6—is that the factors that influence intersectoral variation in
failure rates tend to be more consequential in early stages of life, only to diminish as new firms mature.
While these conclusions are useful, they rely heavily on two-way, or binary, tabulations. Within a binary
framework, it is often difficult to separate the influence of one factor on the hazard from those of others.
For instance, when examined independently, both average firm size and job turnover may condition
failure rates; if, however, the incidence of job turnover within industries is highly correlated with firm
size, the effect of turnover on the hazard may be spurious. In this chapter, we investigate the
determinants of failure using a multivariate framework—one that measures the contribution that
individual factors play in conditioning hazard rates after all other factors have been taken into account.
At this stage, we extend the scope of our analysis to account for both macroeconomic and firm-specific
influences on the hazard. What is more, differences in survival probabilities across both provinces and
industries are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. As the factors that condition the hazard
are not invariant to the age of the firm, these inter-provincial and intersectoral differences are examined
at two distinct phases of the lifecycle—infancy (year one) and adolescence (year five). We also examine
the impact of changes in firm size, competitive intensity and macroeconomic conditions on the failure
rate at both stages of the entrant lifecycle (age one and age five).
To examine the above, we use a logit regression model where the hazard rate, h( t ) , is functionally
dependent upon a set of explanatory variables (or covariates).36 These covariates capture the importance
of cyclical, industry-level and firm-specific influences on the failure rate.

36

An alternative approach to the logit regression is the complementary log-log model which is often preferred when event
times are generated by a truly continuous process. In general, logit and complementary log-log models tend not to yield
substantively different results. This is true in the present case, as the vast majority of our results were both qualitatively and
quantitatively similar in comparisons between the two models.

<-----Page 49----->7.1 A Hazard Rate Model

In our first exercise we pool observations across cohorts and base the regression on all available firmyear data on individual firms. Conceptually, then, the sample data for the regression encompasses firms
born in different years (ranging from 1984-1994) and of various ages (1 to 12). 37
Measuring the Probability of Failure

In a logit framework, the dependent variable is the log odds of the hazard. Formally, this takes the form
log[h(t ) /(1 − h(t ))]

where h(t) is the hazard rate or conditional probability of failure. Its operational measure is a binary (0,1)
variable y which takes a value of 1 in the year during which exit occurs.38
Factors Influencing the Hazard

In addition to the influence of industry characteristics (the focus of previous sections), macroeconomic
and firm-level factors may also play important roles in conditioning success or failure. Even after
controlling for these effects, success may vary substantially depending upon the firm’s host industry or
province of origin. Our set of explanatory variables is discussed below.
Earlier evidence suggests that firm size characteristics should be strongly correlated with the hazard. Our
bivariate analysis in Chapter 5 revealed that the survival prospects of new firms tend to be better, on
average, in industries with larger average entrant sizes. In our view, this relates to differences in the costs
associated with the entry gamble; in industries with larger incumbents, the costs of failure—measured in
terms of sunk costs, physical and financial capital—are often higher. This reduces the number of
potential firms that are willing to take the entry gamble, which, in equilibrium, increases the likelihood
that actual entrants will survive. Our first explanatory variable (RASE) is the ratio of two size measures:
the employment of the firm divided by the average employment of all first-year firms within that
entrant’s industry. For firms in their initial year of life, this is a direct proxy for relative efficiency at
start-up. As new firms mature, it becomes a de facto proxy for growth, as it captures the evolution of
firm size relative to the average initial entry size within the industry. We posit that this measure of
relative size is negatively correlated with the likelihood of failure. As this ratio increases, the size
disadvantages associated with entry fall.

37

The version of the LEAP database used for the regression analysis allowed us to include 1995 data – as exit characteristics
for this year could be accurately measured. Accordingly, the regression analysis excludes firm data for 1996 – the point at
which right censoring occurs. To construct the sample data set, we converted our longitudinal database – the original data
source that tracks individual firms over time – to a ‘firm year’ database. In this firm-year format, the firm’s lifespan
determines the number of observations that it will contribute to the data set. For example, a firm that lives for only one year
will contribute one observation, whereas a firm that lives for five years will contribute five observations. For an overview of
this estimation technique, see Allison (1984).
38
To illustrate, a firm that lives from 1984 to 1987 contributes a total of four observations to the sample (as duration equals
death year less birth year plus one). For its first three years of life (1984-86 inclusive), the variable y takes a value of 0. In
1987, y takes a value of 1, as this is the year during which failure occurs. In the case of right-censored observations, y never
assumes a value of one. For instance, a firm born in 1989 which survives to 1996 (the point at which censoring occurs) will
have 7 observations, each with a y value of zero.

Description

RASE

The next two variables—(CONC) and (TURN)—capture changes in the hazard due to inter-industry
variation in the intensity of competition. As outlined in Chapter 4, the effect of market concentration
(CONC) on the survival rate is ambiguous. If more concentration implies that new firms face less
competition, they may, other things equal, be less likely to fail; conversely, if more concentration implies
greater incumbent response, any gains to entrants from diminished competition among incumbents may
be offset by this more intensive reaction to entrants. Nor is the relation between labour market turnover
(TURN) and entrant survival without its ambiguity. Turnover is a proxy for market volatility or
‘churning’—the process of continual reorganization of labour and market share between incumbent
firms. Industries in which continuing firms exhibit high rates of job turnover may, in the first instance,
afford entrants increased market opportunity, as unstable incumbents are less able to react to new firms;
moreover, workers displaced from incumbents may migrate directly to new firms, bringing their
experience and knowledge of incumbent practices. This said, it might be that a highly volatile
marketplace is equally tenuous for both entrants and incumbents, affording the former no competitive
advantage. For such reasons, we reserve any speculation on the directionality of these effects.
In order to further examine the relation between firm size and exit, we include an additional variable that
we posit to be related to entry costs (RESFS). This variable measures whether size variation in the
entrant pool, relative to the industry average, affects the likelihood of failure—once again focusing on
initial entry conditions. RESFS is thus the ratio of average first-year entrant size within an industry to
average firm size within that industry. Entrants to industries in which start-ups are large relative to the
overall firm average have to make greater investments at the time of entry. We therefore expect less
experimentation and concomitantly lower failure rates.

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

49

<-----Page 51----->Changes in the business cycle may also play a role in determining failure rates. All firms, including
entrants, may reap the benefits of a robust economy. Conversely, economic downturns may lead to
greater failure. To control for the effect of cyclical variation, we include the annual growth rate in real
GDP (GRATE) in the regression analysis.
The age of the firm is expected to condition its likelihood of survival.39 Age is a measure of relative
efficiency. Young, newborn firms are posited to be less efficient and are, thus, more likely to fail than
are firms that have weathered the perils of infancy. We include both the age of the firm (AGE) and its
square (AGE2); the latter term measures the second order effects of age, that is, whether the advantages
of incumbency increase or decrease with time.40
The above factors aside, failure rates may be highly correlated with geographic areas or other elements
of the industry environment. To control for these effects, we include two sets of dummy variables:
(PROV) and (IND). These are binary variables that take a value of 0 or 1 depending on the firm’s
province and industry of origin, respectively.
The regression model takes the form:
log[h(t ) /(1 − h(t ))] = α + å β i xi + å γ i provi + å ∂ i ind i
where the x i variables include the size-related covariates (RASE, RESFS), standard measures of
competitive intensity (CONC, TURN), the growth rate (GRATE), and age effects (AGE, AGE2).
Geographic and industry-specific influences on the hazard are controlled for via (PROV) and (IND),
respectively. 41
Pooled Regression Results

The results of the above regression are reported in Table 12. These are based on all entrants to
commercial industries42 over the period 1984-1994 excluding those based in the territories. For all
variables other than the provincial and industry dummies, the sign of the parameter estimate reveals the
qualitative impact that a change in the associated variable has on the hazard, while controlling for the
effects of all other influences. In this model, a positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the
explanatory variable leads to an increase in the likelihood of failure, or equivalently, a decline in the
probability of survival. A negative coefficient reveals the opposite—the associated variable exerts a
negative effect on the probability of failure, or a positive effect on the likelihood of survival. The
interpretation of the parameter estimates on the provincial and industry dummies is slightly different.
These are calculated against reference groups in Ontario and manufacturing, respectively. Accordingly,
then, a positive coefficient for a given province indicates that its entrants have a higher probability of
failure than do new firms located in Ontario. In a similar vein, a positive coefficient for a particular
industry reveals a higher likelihood of failure in this sector than in manufacturing.
39

Age is defined as (current year – birth year) + 1.
See Audretsch and Mahmood (1995), and Mata, Portugual and Guimaraes (1995). Note that the age variable captures the
effects of both learning and selection. Firms learn as they acquire market experience, which improves their relative
efficiency. The loss of competitors over time also reduces the hazard. One cannot disentangle these effects.
41
For an overview of discrete-time logistic estimation, see Cox (1972) and Allison (1984).
42
The industry exclusions outlined in Chapter 2 are still in effect. In addition to entrants in non-commercial industries
(government services, education services, health services, membership organizations), those classified to Deposit Accepting
Intermediary Industries (a sub-industry within the Finance and Insurance group) are omitted from the regression analysis.

<-----Page 53----->The above model yields sensible results. Our measure of relative size that captures the employment
characteristics of individual firms directly (RASE) has the hypothesized sign. An increase in firm size,
relative to the first-year entrant average within that firm’s industry, decreases the likelihood of failure.
This provides additional firm-level evidence to support the proposition that the survival rate and firm
size characteristics are closely linked.
Gains in average entrant size relative to average firm size (RESFS) also decrease the likelihood of
failure. This suggests that new firms in industries in which entrant sizes are comparable to incumbents
suffer less from systemic scale disadvantages and make greater investments in pre-entry evaluation.
Our proxies for the intensity of competition—(TURN) and (CONC)—reinforce the role that competition
plays in culling out new firms. Industries characterized by intense competition—as measured by the
transfer of resources from one firm to another—are those in which new firms are more likely to fail.
Thus, market volatility does not afford new firms a competitive advantage. Similarly, industries with
lower concentration have higher failure rates. This suggests that new firms in more concentrated
industries do not face a greater likelihood of incumbent response.
The age of the firm (AGE) is also positively correlated with survival. This is consistent with the
proposition that new firms acquire ‘survival momentum’ as they grow older. This reflects the advantages
that accrue with tenure—the development of managerial, marketing and financial competencies—that
give rise, other things equal, to a lower likelihood of failure. As indicated by the positive coefficient on
the (AGE2) term, however, this effect diminishes over time.
Macroeconomic factors also affect the failure rate. A higher rate of growth of real output increases the
probability that new firms will survive. A decline in the growth rate leads to more failure.
The hazard rate for new firms differs across provinces. After controlling for other influences on the
hazard, firms that are located outside of Ontario are more likely to fail. Industry effects are also apparent.
Relative to manufacturing, firms in wholesale trade, finance and insurance, real estate, fishing and
trapping, and business services have a higher survival rate, while those in all other industries fare less
well.
While the qualitative distinctions outlined above are useful, they do not directly provide us with the
actual magnitude of failure rate differentials—that is, numeric differences in the likelihood of failure (or
survival) that exist across individual provinces or industries. However, probabilities of these events can
be recovered directly from the logit regression model. The probability of success Ps is defined as
Ps = 1 − Pf

where Pf denotes the likelihood of failure. In the logit model, this takes the form
Pf =

e bx
1 + e bx

where b is the set of parameter estimates and x represents values for the covariates, evaluated here at the
mean.

Despite the differences in the coefficients attached to the different regions (Table 12), the probability
values indicate that there are only modest differences in the survival rates of new firms across provinces.
In Ontario, the province with the highest success rate, the likelihood of survival (when all covariates are
evaluated at the mean) is 86%, and yet for Newfoundland, the province with the lowest estimate, it
stands at 82%. Among industries, fishing and trapping and finance and insurance have the highest
survival rates (89%), while the residual group of other services—including, among others, amusement
and recreational services and personal and household services—has the lowest rate (81%).

43

Note that all survival rates reported in Chapter 7 are based on logistic regressions. These rates are not calculated in the
same manner as the nonparametric survival rates that were reported earlier.

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

53

<-----Page 55----->To quantify the effects of firm size, competition, age and growth on the survival rate, we examine the
impact of each variable at the 5th and 95th percentiles within its distribution, holding all other variables
constant (at their respective means). This allows us to ascertain whether or not changes in these variables
exert substantial effects on the survival rate, while controlling for the influence of all other factors. To
illustrate, consider the variable (RASE). This is the ratio of two size measures: the employment of the
new firm divided by the average first-year employment of all entrants within that firm’s industry. For the
new firm, this is a proxy for changes in efficiency relative to the entrant pool. Survival rates calculated at
the 5th percentile allow us to examine the quantitative impact of being considerably smaller than the
entrant average, other things equal, whereas the rate calculated at the 95th percentile reveals the impact of
being considerably larger than the industry entrant average.
The survival rate estimates for our continuous variables are reported below.

The size of the firm relative to the entrant pool (RASE) has the most significant impact on failure rates.
New firms that are small relative to the first-year entrant average within their industry have a survival
rate of 76%, whereas those that are large relative to this first-year average exhibit a 96% survival rate.
Changes in the age of the firm (AGE) also exert a strong influence on the failure rate. Firms that are
young relative to the overall average for new firms are 12% less likely to survive than are firms that are
mature relative to this average. The gains that accrue with tenure, however, diminish sharply with time.
While an increase in concentration (CONC) and in the size characteristics of the entrant pool (RESFS)
both reduce the likelihood of failure, deviations from the industry average, in either case, have virtually
no quantitative effect on the failure rate. Moving from an industry that is substantially more concentrated
to one that is less concentrated only results in a 0.3% decline in the survival rate. The effect of a similar
shift based on the relative size characteristics of the entrant pool is even smaller.

54

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

<-----Page 56----->Changes in industry turnover (TURN) are only slightly more significant than (CONC) and (RESFS).
New firms in industries with high turnover are about 2% less likely to survive than are entrants in
industries with low turnover.
Finally, macroeconomic conditions bring about only small changes in the survival rate after controlling
for other effects (just over 1%).
7.2 Age-specific Hazards: New Start-Ups versus Adolescents

The above exercise using regression analysis produced less variation in inter-provincial survival rates
than was evident from the aggregate survival rates reported in Chapter 3. This is because the regression
obscures some of the variation in failure rates that occurs at different phases of the lifecycle by
presuming that the effect of each variable is independent of age. The survival estimates presented above
are based on a pooled regression that combines firms of different ages from across different cohorts.
While our regression reveals that the age of the firm is positively associated with the probability of
survival, the model tacitly assumes that all the parameter estimates remain constant across firms with
different age profiles. If the determinants of failure are highly age-specific, pooled regressions of the sort
outlined above may obscure important differences in these relationships.
To investigate the determinants of survival at different phases of an entrant’s lifecycle, we perform two
age-specific regressions. The first regression includes data for all cohort groups, but limits the sample
only to firms in their initial year of life. The evidence presented in earlier chapters suggests that
differences in hazard rates are more pronounced in infancy. In early years, entrants differ considerably in
terms of their relative efficiency, and culling is apt to play a greater role in removing less efficient firms
from the market. We then estimate a second age-specific regression, focusing on firms in their fifth year
of life. These are entrants that have survived the vicissitudes of infancy and have reached early
adolescence. These age-specific regressions allow us to clearly distinguish between the post-entry
performance of brand new firms and those that emerge into early adolescence.
We again use a logit regression to model the hazard and estimate survival probabilities. The estimation
equation takes the same functional form as earlier, except that we omit the (AGE) and (AGE2) terms
from the set of explanatory variables. The regressands are (0,1) binary variables—y(1) and y(5)—
defined as follows:
•

When the sample is limited to all firms of age 1, y(1) takes a value of 1 if exit occurs, 0 if otherwise.

•

When the sample is limited to all firms of age 5, y(5) takes a value of 1 if exit occurs, 0 if otherwise.

The results of the above regressions, along with probability estimates for provinces and industries, are

<-----Page 58----->The qualitative impact of the explanatory variables in the first year of life (Table 15, column 1) is
virtually identical to the result reported earlier when we combined firms of all ages. The sign on the
(RASE) variable is again negative—an increase in firm size relative to the average first-year size of all
entrants in the same industry enhances the likelihood of survival. New firms benefit from larger firm size
at start-up. Similarly, gains in average industry first-year entrant size relative to average industry firm
size (RESFS) are associated with less failure. Once again, concentration is positively associated with
survival, while more industry turnover leads to concomitantly more failure among newborns. Finally,
start-ups benefit from more robust macroeconomic conditions (GRATE).
Qualitative differences in provincial and industry hazard rates are similar to those reported earlier. After
controlling for other factors, entrants in their first year of life fare better in Ontario than in other
provinces. Unlike our earlier results, however, the magnitude of these inter-provincial differences is now
substantial (Table 15, column 2). Firms in their initial year of life exhibit a much higher success rate in
Ontario (80%) than in the Atlantic Provinces (63%-67%). Business start-ups in British Columbia (78%),
Quebec (77%) and Alberta (76%) are more likely to survive their first year than are those in
Saskatchewan (73%) or Manitoba (70%).
Variation in first-year survival rates across industries is also apparent. Business start-ups with the highest
likelihood of surviving their first year occur in wholesale trade (82%), business services (81%) and real
estate industries (81%). New firms in agriculture (72%), communications (72%) and other services
(67%) fare less well.
Our second age-specific regression focuses on firms in a different stage of their lifecycle—those in their
fifth year. These firms have weathered the vicissitudes of early infancy. They are older than the median
firm. They did not fail when the factors encouraging exit are most consequential. In this respect, they
represent more successful new firms.
Increases in fifth-year firm size relative to the first-year entrant average (RASE) lead to a higher
probability of survival (Table 15, column 3). Adolescent firms that have grown, or that maintain size
advantages over start-ups are likely to be better off. While both start-ups and adolescent firms benefit
from gains in relative firm size, the average size characteristics of the entrant pool (RESFS) will affect
these firms in different ways. For start-ups, changes in the size distribution of entrants capture
differences in the cost of the entry gamble; for adolescents, they influence the amount of competitive
pressure that start-ups can exert on existing firms. An increase in relative entrant size leads to more
survival among start-ups; this, in turn, increases the intensity of competition facing adolescents,
resulting in more failure.
While more turnover (TURN) leads to higher failure rates in both infants and adolescents, industry
concentration (CONC) affects firms of different ages in different ways. In five-year old firms, increased
concentration leads to more, not less, failure. This suggests that incumbent response plays a greater role
in conditioning hazard rates after firms emerge from infancy, when incumbents can identify which
entrants constitute the greatest potential threat.
These age-specific differences in concentration support our interpretation of the entry process as one of
experimentation—one in which differences in the costs associated with the entry gamble affect initial
survival rates. In some industries, concentration brings about a higher likelihood of failure in mature
entrants. And it is in these situations where one would expect to find less experimentation on the part of
entrants in general, and therefore relatively lower failure rates, during the years when entrants are being
Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

57

<-----Page 59----->culled out. There is, in this sense, a dynamic interplay between short and long run failure rates; more
failure in the long run may lead to more cautious entry, and hence lower failure rates in the short run.
Geographic influences on the hazard rate are also strikingly different for adolescent firms. Previously,
when new firms of different ages were examined simultaneously, entrants in Ontario had a lower
likelihood of failure than entrants in other provinces. The same was true when we focused exclusively on
firms in their first year of life. Interestingly, this is not the case for adolescent firms. In four provinces—
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec—adolescents are less likely to fail than
their counterparts in Ontario. This may reflect more stable market structures in these provinces—markets
in which adolescent firms face less competition. In addition, differences in hazard rates between Ontario
and all other provinces are not statistically significant. This being said, quantitative differences in
survival probabilities across provinces—even when these differences are statistically significant—are not
large. What is more, the survival rates are all extremely high (Table 15, column 4). Irrespective of their
province of origin, new firms that survive to their fifth year have roughly a 90% likelihood of surviving
this year.
These age-related differences in survival rates across regions are compatible with underlying differences
in economic or competitive environments—though not in ways that are necessarily obvious at first
thought. Ontario, the largest and most developed region, has the lowest failure rates in the initial year;
but it fares less well relative to other provinces when firms reach early adolescence. This suggests a
more dynamic economy for incumbents. And it is in these situations where entrants should be more
cautious—leading to lower rates of failure in initial years.
Post-entry performance across industries also varies in accordance with the age of new firms. Start-ups
in mining and communications are more likely than their counterparts in manufacturing to fail during
their first year. Start-ups in real estate industries and business services are more likely than those in
manufacturing to survive their first year. None of these sectoral differences are apparent in year five.
Other age-specific differences in relative performance also emerge. For instance, start-ups in fishing and
trapping are less likely than those in manufacturing to survive their first year, while adolescents in the
former are more likely to survive their fifth year. The reverse is true of new firms in wholesale trade.
Such differences aside, the probability that a five year old firm will survive the year is uniformly high,
regardless of its industry of origin.
Size, Competition and Growth: Their Effects Over Time

The results of our regression analysis reveal that (1) survival rates for new firms differ across provinces
and industries, and that (2) the nature and extent of these differences are closely tied to the age of new
firms. Business start-ups in Ontario fare better in their first year of life than do those in other provinces.
This is not true, however, of adolescent firms, as those in certain provinces—Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec—are less likely to fail than their counterparts in Ontario,
while those in the remaining provinces are no better, nor worse, off. The performance of new firms in
certain industries also differs by age group. While entrants in manufacturing have a lower failure rate in
their initial year of life than those in fishing and trapping, mining or communications, this is not true of
adolescents. These differences underscore the effect that age, or more to the point, market experience,
has on survival rates—due to changes over time in relative efficiency and competitive advantage. Since
both of these factors are influenced by the costs of experimentation associated with entry, these results
also emphasize the fact that entrant performance in early infancy is often inversely related to entrant
performance in early adolescence, that entrants appear to anticipate later difficulties when it comes to
58

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

<-----Page 60----->entry by experimentation. Sectors where experimentation is seen as costly will dissuade potential
entrants from taking the entry gamble. This, in turn, will remove ‘less efficient’ firms from the entry
pool, leading to higher survival rates in early years. A more ‘cautious’ (and efficient) entry cohort may
lead to more intense competition among these firms as they mature, and concomitantly, higher failure
rates in early adolescence.
Our survivor and hazard rate analysis in Chapter 5 demonstrated that industry characteristics that
influence the entry decision—such as the size characteristics of firms entering the market—have a larger
effect on failure rates among infants than among adolescents. In what follows, we again focus inter alia
on the effects of size and competition in order to ascertain whether or not their influence on the survival
rate is more significant at different stages of the entrant lifecycle. It may be the case that deviations in
firm size relative to the entrant average have more of an effect on the survival rate for first-year start-ups
than for emerging firms. The same may prove true of certain industry-level characteristics, such as
concentration or turnover.
To investigate these issues, we utilize the results of our two age-specific regressions and, once again,
estimate the effects of size, competition and growth variables at their 5th and 95th percentiles, holding all
other variables constant (at their respective means). The survival rates are reported in Table 16, for both
first-year firms and those in their fifth year.

Comparisons of first-year and fifth-year survival rates prove illuminating. The size of new firms relative
to the industry first-year entrant average (RASE)—our base measure of relative efficiency—is the
principal determinant of survival (or failure). The quantitative effect of deviations in firm size from the
first-year average significantly exceeds those of the other variables. For first-year firms, those with
substantial size disadvantages have a 72% likelihood of surviving the year. Those with size advantages,
by contrast, have an 83% probability of surviving their initial year. The effect of changes in firm size
relative to the first-year average is even more pronounced in the fifth year of life. Small firms (relative to
the first-year industry average) have a 79% likelihood of surviving their fifth year, while large firms are
virtually certain to survive (99%). That changes in relative size are as, if not more, consequential for
adolescent firms is noteworthy, given earlier evidence that the factors that influence failure are more
active in early life.

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

59

<-----Page 61----->Relative differences in the intensity of competition at various stages of the entrant’s lifecycle have less
of an effect. Industry concentration (CONC) is more significant for new start-ups than for adolescents.
New firms in industries with relatively low levels of concentration have a 74% likelihood of surviving
their first-year, whereas those in highly concentrated sectors have an 80% likelihood of doing so. As
discussed earlier, this provides some evidence that new start-ups benefit more from less competition, and
are less likely to face incumbent response. For new firms in their fifth year, these effects work in the
opposite direction. That said, adolescents have roughly a 90% chance of surviving their fifth year,
irrespective of whether their industry is more or less concentrated. Changes in the size characteristics of
entrants (RESFS) have a similar effect. First-year firms in industries with large entrants are 5% more
likely to survive their initial year than are first-year firms in industries with small entrants. Changes in
the industry size characteristics of first-year firms have less of an impact on adolescents.
Compared to concentration and relative entrant size, changes in job turnover exert slightly less of an
influence on the survival rate for start-ups. The first-year survival rate in low and high turnover
industries stands at 77% and 75% respectively. For firms in their fifth year, both rates are once again
roughly 90%.
Macroeconomic effects (GRATE) on the survival rate are also fairly consistent among these age groups.
A move from a low growth rate to a high growth rate increases the likelihood of survival marginally for
both first-year and fifth-year firms.
7.3 The Timing of Entry: Differences Across Birth Years

In the previous section, we examined factors that condition failure at two distinct stages of the entrant
lifecycle: infancy and adolescence. Several findings emerged from this exercise: (1) inter-provincial and
inter-industry variation in the hazard rate is far more prevalent among newborns than among
adolescents, (2) changes in competitive intensity can affect infants and adolescents differently, and (3)
the impact of changes in relative efficiency can be more consequential for adolescents than for
newborns. In this section, we explore a final issue—how the timing of entry affects the characteristics of
the hazard function.
Earlier, we controlled for the impact of cyclical variation on the hazard rate by including the growth rate
in GDP as a covariate in our regression models. While this variable captures differences in the failure
rate associated with the timing of the entry decision, it does not evaluate whether the determinants of
failure differ across cohorts in accordance with the timing of entry. It may be that the effects of certain
covariates (e.g., relative firm size, and concentration) vary across cohorts since some cohorts may be
more ‘advantaged’ than others. In particular, when the macroeconomic environment is generally
favourable, a different set of entrants may try their luck. This will lead to different reactions to the
variables that reflect the nature of the difficulties that new firms face. We do not have strong priors on
the nature of these differences. If good times lead to less cautious entry, new firms may respond less to
variables that proxy the obstacles that they will face down the road. On the other hand, a poor economic
climate may, through the push factor associated with poorer alternate economic opportunity, bring about
entry by less well prepared entrepreneurs and hence encourage less cautious behaviour.
We investigate this issue by examining differences in the hazard function for newborns over two distinct
entry periods: 1980s cohorts (firms that enter during 1984-89) and 1990s cohorts (those that enter during
1990-94).
60

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

<-----Page 62----->Our focus on newborns—firms in their first year of life—stems from the fact that failure rates among
very young businesses are relatively high. Unlike adolescents, these are inexperienced firms that are
more vulnerable to the selection process (the separation of efficient and inefficient firms). Consequently,
differences in the hazard function related to the timing of the entry decision may be more apparent
among newborn firms than among older entrants.
Our decision to decompose entry cohorts into two dichotomous groupings (1980s and 1990s) serves two
objectives. In the first instance, a dichotomous grouping which pools entry cohorts into two groups is
analytically expedient, as this allows for the convenient use of interaction terms to test for formal
differences in the effects of other covariates on the hazard rate—differences that follow directly from the
timing of the entry decision. An alternative strategy would be to examine the effects of each cohort
individually (by including dummy variables for birth year in a manner analogous to the industry or
geographic dummies in the previous regression). Our primary interest, however, lies not with examining
whether differences in the likelihood of failure exist across different entry cohorts (relative to some
reference group), but rather with ascertaining whether the influence of other factors on the hazard rate—
relative efficiency, competitive intensity—is more or less significant across broad groupings of cohorts
that differed in terms of the economic environment that they faced upon initial entry.

Our second objective in adopting this approach centres on the convenient division between the 1980s
and the 1990s. Given that our focus is on first-year firms, this divides the sample into two groups of
entry cohorts (1984-89 and 1990-94 respectively). We are interested in examining whether the
determinants of failure are different for new firms in the 1990s than they were for firms in the 1980s.
This division captures differences in the business cycle. The economy experienced relatively high
growth rates in real GDP during the mid-to-late 1980s (roughly 3% and higher); by contrast, growth
rates were substantially lower through the first few years of the 1990s (Figure 14).

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

61

<-----Page 63----->To evaluate differences in the two entry periods, we estimate a model of the following form:
y = α + å β i xi + å γ i provi + å ∂ i ind i + ωD + åτ i D * xi + åθ i D * provi + å ρ i D * ind i
where D is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the firm entered in the 1980s and a value of 0 if
the firm entered in the 1990s. The dependent variable y is once again the log-odds of the hazard rate.
This model is equivalent to the earlier age-specific regression, except for the inclusion of interactive
terms on all the covariates and a dummy intercept term.
Once again, we have restricted the sample only to firms in their first year of life. Accordingly, the
dependent variable takes a value of 1 if the firm failed during its initial year and a value of 0 if failure
did not occur during this year. We present the results in Table 17.
In this regression, the parameter estimates on the non-interaction variables (Table 17, column 1)
correspond to entry cohorts in the 1990s, while the interaction terms (Table 17, column 2) test whether
the effects of individual covariates on the failure rate differ across the two entry periods (1980s versus
1990s). For all variables in column 1 other than the provincial and industry dummies, a positive
coefficient indicates that an increase in the associated variable leads to an increase in the probability of
failure for first-year firms that entered in the 1990s. To illustrate, an increase in industry concentration
(CONC) leads to a higher likelihood of survival for newborns that entered during the 1990-94 period. By
contrast, the parameter estimate on the corresponding interaction term in column 2 examines whether
this relationship is more or less important in the 1980s. The negative coefficient on the interaction term
for (CONC) indicates that its positive effect on the survival rate is more pronounced during the 1980s.44
The interpretation of parameter estimates on the provincial and industry dummies is more complex given
that these are calculated against reference groups—Ontario and manufacturing, respectively. The
positive parameter on the Prince Edward Island term in column 1 indicates that first-year start-ups in
Prince Edward Island that entered during the 1990s are more likely to fail than are first-year start-ups in
Ontario over the same period. The negative parameter estimate on the associated interaction term
(column 2) indicates that new start-ups in Prince Edward Island do slightly better relative to Ontario in
the 1980s than they do in the 1990s.45 In a similar vein, the negative coefficient on wholesale trade in
column 1 indicates that first-year wholesalers that enter in the 1990s are more likely to survive than their
counterparts that enter manufacturing industries. The negative and significant coefficient on the
associated interaction term indicates that this was increasingly so during the 1980s—wholesalers did
even better relative to manufactures if they entered during the 1980s.

44

In all cases, the coefficient estimate for the 1980s is just the sum of the 1990s coefficient (column 1) and the coefficient on
the interaction term (column 2). If both are negative, they sum to a larger negative number, which then indicates that the
associated variable leads to a higher likelihood of survival during the 1980s. Conversely, if the interaction term was positive,
the sum of these two terms is a smaller negative number (assuming that the absolute value of the 1990s coefficient was larger
than the coefficient on the interaction term). In this case, the associated variable exerts less of a positive influence on the
survival rate during the 1980s.
45
This parameter estimate is statistically significant and its absolute magnitude is smaller.

<-----Page 65----->On balance, the above exercise yields sensible findings. The structure of the hazard function for firstyear firms in the two entry periods (Table 17) is generally consistent with the overall hazard function for
all first-year firms (Table 15, column 1).46 To examine the sensitivity of changes in firm size,
competitive intensity and growth on the failure rate in each of the two entry periods, we supplement the
regression data in Table 17 with estimates of the survival rate at the 5th and 95th percentiles (Table 18).

As expected, an increase in firm size relative to the industry first-year entrant average (RASE) enhances
the likelihood of survival—suggesting that changes in relative efficiency are strongly correlated with the
failure rate. Inefficient firms that, on average, enter the market during years with robust growth rates are
comparatively better off (a survival rate of 75%) than those that do so in the 1990s (a survival rate of
70%). Reducing the size disadvantage, however, is slightly less important during the 1980s (a survival
rate differential of 10%) than during the 1990s (a survival rate differential of 13%). Other things equal, a
strong economy affords smaller, less efficient firms some minor advantage in their first year of life that a
weaker economy does not, and makes them slightly better off relative to larger entrants.
As before, new firms in more concentrated industries (CONC) are more likely to succeed. This suggests
that new start-ups benefit from lower levels of competition and do not face much incumbent response.
The positive association between market concentration and the success rate is more apparent for firstyear firms in the 1980s than for those in the 1990s. Differences in the survival rate between firms in
‘much less’ and ‘much more’ concentrated industries are also larger for newborns in the first entry
period. Unlike firm-specific characteristics such as relative efficiency, the effects of market structure on
the survival rate of brand new entrants are more evident in times of robust growth than in times of
anaemic growth.
Results for turnover (TURN) provide additional evidence that the impact of market structure varies
across the two entry periods. An increase in turnover leads to more failure among first-year firms. This
effect is slightly more apparent in the 1980s.

Note once again that the estimated parameter for the 1980s is just the sum of the 1990s parameter and the interaction term.

<-----Page 66----->The effects of the remaining continuous variables—relative industry entrant size (RESFS) and GDP
growth (GRATE)—on the hazard rate across these two entry periods are less obvious. In contrast to the
first-year regression that pooled all entry cohorts (Table 15), the failure rate for newborns in the 1990s is
not affected by changes in relative industry entrant size. That said, there is evidence from the interaction
model that its impact on the failure rate is more pronounced during the 1980s. Differences in survival
rates related to the size characteristics of entrants are more prevalent in the 1980s, while, during the
1990s, they are negligible.
More curious is the sign on the growth rate variable (GRATE). In the interactive model, this coefficient
is positive, suggesting that higher GDP growth leads, in effect, to more failure. What is more, this
positive association between growth and failure is stronger during the 1980s than during the 1990s. The
explanation for this may be largely statistical in nature. In much of our preliminary analysis, the
directionality of macroeconomic effects was very sensitive to changes in model specification. This is
especially true when estimating hazard models over subsamples such as particular cohorts or age groups.
The growth variable in the earlier work was essentially capturing the difference between the 1980s and
the 1990s rather than individual-year effects.
Investigating the effects of firm size, competition and growth on the failure rate in the two entry periods
is relatively straightforward. As noted earlier, this is less true when examining provincial or industry
dummies because these variables are calculated directly against a reference group. Changes in the
relative performance of a province over time reflect the performance of start-ups in that province and the
performance of start-ups in the reference province (here Ontario). The net effects are captured in the
interaction terms presented in Table 17.
Our interactive regression does provide some evidence of changes in relative performance over the two
entry periods. Certain provinces—Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan—
were better off relative to Ontario in the 1980s than they are in the 1990s. British Columbia, New
Brunswick and Quebec were relatively worse off in the 1980s.
Variation in inter-industry performance is also apparent across the two entry periods. Certain
industries—construction, wholesale trade and real estate—are better off relative to manufacturing during
the 1980s. Others, such as agriculture, fishing, retail trade and business services, are worse off.
A more expedient method of examining differences in post-entry performance across the two entry
periods is simply to examine the associated survival rates. We present these in Table 19.
Some clear differences in the failure rate of first-year firms emerge over these two entry periods. The
Atlantic Provinces, with the exception of New Brunswick, experience sharp declines in the success rate
during the 1990s, as do Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Alberta is also better off in the 1980s. Quebec,
Ontario and British Columbia experience small to modest declines in the success rate during the 1990s.
Only New Brunswick fares as well in the more recent entry period as it does in the 1980s.47

47

The results for British Columbia provide an excellent illustration of the difference between absolute and relative post entry
performance. The interaction term on the regression indicates that British Columbia was worse off relative to Ontario during
the 1980s, yet its survival rate is actually higher in this period. First-year firms performed relatively better in Ontario in the
1980s, which, in turn, gives rise to this net change for British Columbia.

<-----Page 67----->Differences in industry survival rates across these periods also emerge. Of these industries, only the firstyear performance of communications firms and those in other services improve significantly in the
1990s. Most industries exhibit increased failure rates, the magnitude of which is sometimes substantial
(e.g., wholesale trade, construction). Most other industries show modest declines in the success rate.

In conclusion, it is evident that the exit process varies not only by age of entrant but also by cohort. In
particular, cohorts that enter in periods of felicitous economic circumstances react to or are affected
differently by firm and industry-specific conditions. First, it is apparent that industry and geographic
effects vary. This is simply a reflection of the fact that industries and regions are affected differently by
the business cycle. An evaluation of any multivariate analysis of regional or industry differences in
survival or hazard rates must not treat the results as immutable but rather should take into account the
fact that the specific results reported may be highly susceptible to the time period chosen and the
economic circumstances of the time. Second, the results show that variables that proxy inefficiency and
the intensity of competition have qualitatively similar though quantitatively different impacts. During the
1980s, survival rates were more strongly correlated with changes in the intensity of competition (e.g.,
turnover and concentration). At the same time, being smaller during these boom years has less of an
impact on the likelihood that a start-up will fail. This suggests that, in good times, firms are less
vulnerable to their own mistakes resulting from choosing an inappropriate size, but, at the same time, are
more vulnerable to external competition.

<-----Page 68----->Chapter 8 – Conclusions

D

ynamic change in the firm population results from a competitive process that replaces old firms
with new ones (Baldwin, 1995). Part of this occurs as market share shifts from incumbents in
decline to those who are growing. But an important component of this process comes from the entry of
new firms who displace others. New firms are important since they provide new ideas essential for
innovation and are a vital source of discipline to incumbents.
While substantial numbers of new firms enter the marketplace each year, many of these firms exit
quickly. Failure rates among entrants are extremely high. Some 40% have exited by their second
birthday. About 75% die by their eighth birthday. On average, mean survival time is about six years,
while the median length of life is approximately three years.
The early years are the most difficult for entrants. Hazard rates are high in the first years of life, but these
failure rates decline as firms mature. The probability that a new firm will not live past its first birthday is
23%. The probability that a new firm that has reached the age of five will fail during its fifth year is
14%. This indicates that the process of culling out the least efficient is most vigorous among very young
firms. This is consistent with earlier work (Baldwin and Rafiquzzaman, 1995) that found that
competition removes the most inefficient of new entrants.
The high turnover in the entrant population has led some to describe the process as a revolving door
(Audretsch, 1995). While it is true that the majority of entrants fail within ten years of birth, many
remain, and do grow (Baldwin, 1999). Behind the revolving door is an escalator that rewards those that
survive the perils of infancy. The net result of the failure of some members of a cohort and the growth of
survivors is to leave the importance of a representative birth cohort essentially unchanged, at least over
the first five years of life. However, the effect of entry accumulates over time as more and more cohorts
of new firms arrive to compete with incumbents.
Understanding inter-industry differences in failure rates requires a conceptual framework. Entry can be
viewed as a process that replaces old firms with new more efficient ones. In this case, exit occurs when
competition is more intense. Alternatively, entry can be regarded as a process that involves an
experiment. This process involves a considerable investment in knowledge by new firms—knowledge of
how to organize, how to produce, how to invest, how to market, and how to manage. Some of this
knowledge can be acquired before entry. Additional knowledge can be acquired after entry. The latter
will be pursued extensively in situations where experimentation is less expensive. In industries where
this is true, we would expect to find both high entry and high exit. Many firms will test out the market
when experimentation is less costly. And many of these entrants will find their skills lacking and
subsequently exit the marketplace. On this view, failure is a natural part of experimentation. Moreover,
higher rates of exit in certain industries only indicate basic differences in the cost of experimentation and
not the existence of market imperfections related to competitive conditions.
While we find some evidence of industry-level effects associated with the competitive environment, they
are not the sole cause of failure. Nor are they necessarily the most important. For instance, aggregate
survival rates are not strongly correlated with differences in inter-industry concentration or turnover.
This suggests that the relationship between competition and failure is not one-dimensional. While the

Statistics Canada – Catalogue no. 61-526

67

<-----Page 69----->effects of competition are more apparent after controlling for other influences on the hazard rate, they
depend upon the age of the firm, and they are generally small. Among new start-ups, more concentration
leads to more survival, which suggests that very young firms benefit from less competition and that
incumbent response at this stage is not particularly robust. Among adolescents, however, more industry
concentration leads to more failure—although its impact on the hazard is small. Changes in turnover,
while positively associated with the hazard at both stages of the entrant lifecycle, have only a minor
impact on the failure rate of start-ups.
Evidence that experimentation costs influence the failure rate is somewhat stronger. Aggregate survival
rates are positively correlated with an industry’s firm size characteristics. Larger size requirements
presuppose higher failure costs—accordingly, industries in which failure is less expensive encourage
more entrants, and thus more failure. That entry and hazard rates are positively correlated is further
evidence of this.
Our multivariate analysis is consistent with this entry-as-experimentation framework. In general, entrants
to industries in which first-year firms are large relative to the average firm are more likely to succeed.
This is true at start-up—the point at which new firms have to make substantial investments in the entry
gamble. There is evidence that an increase in relative entrant size, in turn, leads to more failure among
adolescents, as firms at this stage will face greater competition from more efficient entry cohorts.
The impact of relative firm size is increasingly significant when viewed from the standpoint of the
individual firm. On this view, it is not so much the average entrant, but rather the size of a new firm
relative to this industry average that determines success or failure. Thus, both firm- and industry-specific
attributes condition the likelihood of survival. Firms that are large relative to the industry first-year
average stand a much better chance of surviving than those that are small relative to this average. Large
new firms make more substantial investments in the entry process, and thus, have more to lose in the
event of failure. Large entrants are also more likely to be subsidiaries of firms that exist elsewhere and
may have more expertise to call on.
Our conclusion that relative firm size has a significant impact on the failure rate is consistent with much
of the empirical literature on post-entry performance. New firms that suffer from scale disadvantages are
more likely to exit. A review of the evidence is found in Audretsch (1995) who discusses the role of
scale disadvantages within the context of a dynamic selection process. Many suboptimal scale firms
enter the marketplace—those that do not address their size disadvantages are likely to be culled; those
that do grow and obtain minimum efficient scale are apt to survive. In this light, growth can be seen as a
necessary condition for survival. Both Audretsch (1995) and Jovanovic (1982) advance a view of the
selection process in which the inefficient exit and the efficient remain, where efficiency is closely tied to
scale (or size) optimality.
The results of our age-specific regressions are consistent with the dynamic selection hypothesis
advanced by Audretsch and Jovanovic. We investigate the consequences of deviations in relative size at
two stages of the lifecycle—infancy and adolescence. Start-ups that are small relative to the first-year
entrant average are more likely to fail than those that are large relative to this average; the same holds
true of adolescents. That the positive impact of size advantages on the survival rate is more pronounced
for adolescents is illuminating. In our regression exercise, infants that are much larger than the industry
first-year entrant average have a 83% probability of survival; for comparable five year old firms, the rate
stands at 99%. Growth and scale advantages, in this sense, are important determinants of success.

<-----Page 70----->Other firm-specific effects, such as age, also affect the failure rate. The likelihood that new firms will
survive increases as firms acquire market experience. This is also consistent with earlier studies (for an
overview, see Audretsch, 1995). The benefits that accrue with age, however, tend to diminish with time.
This said, there is some evidence that failure rates do not decline uniformly as new firms age. While, in
general, hazard rates are high for very young firms, only to decline gradually and level out as new firms
emerge from infancy, the shape of the hazard curve during the early years of life is, in certain cases,
consistent with the existence of a honeymoon effect—especially for larger firms. Aggregate survival
rates for new firms in industries with medium and large average firm sizes (and average entrant sizes)
are illustrative. These show an increasing hazard rate from the first to the second year. Inefficient firms
in these industries—sectors with relatively high experimentation costs—may have greater resources to
draw upon prior to being culled. Consequently, failure rates do not reach a maximum at year one, but
rather in the second year, after which much of the initial asset stock has presumably been depleted.
The impact of age on other determinants of failure is more complex. For instance, changes in
competitive intensity affect firms of different ages in different ways. Newer entrants benefit from more
concentration—adolescents do not. Both benefit from gains in relative size.
Differences in failure rates across provinces and industries are far greater among very young firms than
among those that survive infancy. Newborn firms in Ontario have a lower hazard rate than those in other
provinces—when compared to the Atlantic Provinces, these differences are very significant. By the time
new firms reach adolescence, a different pattern emerges. New firms in other provinces fare just as well
as those in Ontario, and, in certain cases, are better off. This said, differences in hazard rates among
adolescent firms tend to be minor. Similar age-effects are evident across industries—differences in
failure rates at the industry-level are greater among new start-ups than among adolescents.
In the final analysis, the evidence presented herein sheds light on the length of time we should use to
classify a firm as new. Dramatic changes occur in the evolution of entrants in their first five years of life.
This is driven by the process of selection that all new firms face—the dynamics of competition that
reward the more competent and that remove the less competent. This process is most active among very
young firms, as any group of newborns will be characterized by wide disparities in operating
efficiencies. Firms that reach their fifth year have, to a large degree, weathered this process, and,
consequently, exhibit less variation in their efficiency characteristics. While both infants (first-year
firms) and adolescents (fifth-year firms) can be described as ‘new’, the ‘liability of newness’, as it is
commonly understood, pertains more so to the former—to business start-ups that have not yet emerged
from infancy. Accordingly, hazard rate differentials across provinces and industries are far more
prevalent among newborns than among adolescents. The role that competitive intensity and relative
efficiency play in conditioning the hazard rate also differs in accordance with the age profile of new
firms—though in ways that are not necessarily obvious a priori. In the first instance, variation in
industry concentration, a basic proxy for changes in competitive intensity, has a greater impact on the
failure rate for infants than on the failure rate for adolescents. For newborns, the likelihood of survival
increases with more industry concentration, while the reverse is true of adolescents. For both groups,
gains in relative efficiency measured at the level of the firm increase the survival rate—particularly for
adolescents. These lifecycle effects reinforce the structural differences that exist between brand new
firms and those with market experience. While both are in a broad sense ‘new’, infants and adolescents
should not be seen as equivalent firms.

69

<-----Page 71----->Lastly, the study has shown that there are substantial cohort effects. The survival rate differences across
regions depend very much on how the economic cycle has affected these regions. Industry and regional
fortunes vary across entry periods and thus generalizations about the relative riskiness of different
political jurisdictions or industries should only be made with caution. The results also show that entrant
cohorts that are associated with good macroeconomic conditions not only have a lower mean failure rate
but they are less affected by size disadvantages. The economic environment is related to differences not
only in these firm characteristics but also in how the industry environment affects failure. While the
reasons for these differences must await further research, they suggest that the factors that motivate the
entry decision differ across the business cycle.

<-----Page 75-----><-----Page 76----->Appendix B – Survival and Hazard Rates,
Industry by Region

I

n this appendix, we report survival and hazard rates for various industry/region combinations. Our
focus is again on new firms that enter the market during the 1984-1994 period. As all entrants are
right-censored in 1995, the maximum survival time under study is 11 years.
Two tables are presented for each of the 15 industries examined in the report—the first contains survival
rates, and the second, the associated hazard rates. These are calculated at the regional level (Atlantic
Provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Prairie Provinces, British Columbia). The decision to move from the
provincial to a regional level is due to small numbers of entrants (and by extension, exits) in certain
industry/province combinations.
Note that these rates are calculated from the provincial datafile and are not directly comparable to the
rates reported in Tables 3 and 4 of the text.

<-----Page 92----->Appendix C – Survival and Hazard Rates,
Firm Size by Region

I

n this appendix, we report survival and hazard rates for various province/firm size combinations. We
again focus on entrants over the 1984-94 period. Censoring occurs in 1995 and the maximum survival
time is 11 years. We calculate rates at the provincial level—grouping entrants into 3 broad size ranges:
Micro-firms (less than 5 employees)
Small and medium size firms (5-99 employees)
Large firms (100+ employees)
Firms are allocated to a particular size class based on employment in their initial year.

Industry by Region

T

his appendix provides additional detail on industry and regional business populations. For each of
the 15 industries, we present time series data on both the regional firm populations and regional
entrant populations.
We include these tables to provide the reader with some basic information, first, on how firm and entrant
populations in specific industries vary across regions, and second, on how industry demographics within
these regions evolve over time.
We address the issue of entry rate measurement in detail in Appendix E.

<-----Page 112----->Appendix E – Entry Rate Measurement

E

mpirical studies of the entry and exit process had been restricted primarily to case studies (e.g.,
Mansfield, 1962) until the advent of large micro-databases, most of which had been developed when
statistical agencies and private firms computerized their files on firm populations during the 1970s and
1980s. These databases originate from official statistical agency files often derived from the
manufacturing population (the Canadian Census of Manufactures or the LRD at the U.S. Bureau of the
Census), or from private sector sources such as the longitudinal file developed at the Small Business
Administration from Dun and Bradstreet records. Similar files exist in other countries. In this study, we
use a more extensive file on the firm population derived from tax records (see Baldwin, Dupuy and
Penner, 1992). In this file, an entrant is defined as a firm that has begun to submit remittance payments
to the government but had not done so in the previous year.
These micro-databases are not perfect and all too often have been accepted without careful examination
of the flaws inherent in them. The Dun and Bradstreet records have received the closest public
scrutiny.48 Two problems are noteworthy. The first deals with the coverage of the population, the second
with the operational definition of entry. We take these up in reverse order below.
In these files, entry is measured as the appearance of a new entity. Entities are records in a file. Entry
then is an event that causes the administrators of these files to issue a new record number.
Unfortunately, many files were not originally established with clear rules as to when old recordidentifiers would be terminated and new record-identifiers birthed. In some files, entities were arbitrarily
assigned new record numbers over time; thus an ongoing entity falsely appears to die and then be born.
This often arises when a merger or a change in control occurs, leading to an overestimation of the
number of births and deaths when these files are used. If there are a large number of false births and
deaths, entry rates will be overstated, as will hazard rates.
Two practical solutions to this problem are available. First, estimates of the error rates can be derived by
sampling the database. This was done for the manufacturing database that has been used to study firm
dynamics in this sector (see Baldwin, 1995). Second, outside information can be used to correct the
database. For example, the Canadian longitudinal file derived from tax records tracks workers over time
to correct for false births and deaths (Baldwin, Dupuy and Penner, 1992). In essence, all workers are
linked to firms and tracked over time. If a firm dies and its workers are mainly found in another firm in
the following year, then this event is registered as a false death. Despite the effort that is devoted to this
correction process, it is imperfect. We, therefore, present new evidence to evaluate the degree of error in
the entry rates that are produced by the file used for this study.

48

See Baldwin and Gorecki (1990, ch.5 ), and Davis et al (1996, pp. 70-72) for a discussion of the shortcomings of the D&B
files.

<-----Page 113----->The issue of coverage can be summarized as follows. New firms go through several stages. They may
just be an idea in an entrepreneur’s mind, or a tentative experiment that may consist only of the founder
working in his garage or home office. Usually at a later stage, this firm begins to hire employees. At a
still later stage, it is incorporated into official business registers and surveyed either by a statistical
agency or by a credit rating agency. It is clear from this taxonomy that there is no ‘correct’ time at which
entry should be measured. Most databases capture firms at an arbitrary point in their birthing experience.
In this paper, we use the LEAP database to measure entry and exit. Despite the work that has been done
to reduce the extent to which false births are registered in this file (described in Baldwin, Dupuy and
Penner, 1992), this problem has not been completely eliminated. This occurs because the method for
analyzing worker movements is more accurate with regards to the largest units. When a firm with 100
workers dies and 80 or so are found in another firm in the following year, the probability that the second
is an extension of the first is very high. When a firm with three workers dies and all three are found
together the next year, the probability of the second being an extension of the first is much less.
Therefore, little attempt is made to edit the LEAP database for units of under five workers.
Consequently, entry rates derived from LEAP may be biased upwards.
An estimate of the size of this bias can be obtained using a special survey that was conducted in 1993.
This survey involved a random sample of all firm births that were registered on the file that, in turn, is
used to generate the LEAP database. The survey was done within six to nine months of the entity making
its first remittances to the government. New entities were contacted and asked whether their
commencing to remit payments to the government for employees was the result of one of several factors.
Some of these can be described for our purposes as resulting in false births.
The factors are divided into two groups. The first set of firms are those which we would classify as false
births. They are:
i) A reorganization of the firm into new payroll units.
ii) A reorganization brought about by a merger or control change.
iii) A new entity that is a new location or branch of an existing business.
The second are legitimate births. These are:
i) Existing firms that just started to hire employees.
ii) New firms—firms that had remitted but that had already failed by the time the survey was
conducted. These are firms that remit on behalf of employees but that die before the survey
date and so indicate when contacted.
iii) New firms—firms that had remitted but that had died by the time the survey was
conducted and that could not even be contacted.
iv) New firms that do not fall into any of the above categories.
The importance of the various components is presented in Table E1. About 10% of new remittants that
show up as new firms were involved in a form of reorganization that should not be construed as a
birth—reorganizations, ownership changes, or new locations. Another 15% are firms that have
legitimately filed remittances but that died almost immediately. A good 28% are firms that existed
previously but suddenly started hiring employees. Finally 48% are firms that are new and have just
started to hire employees. This means that only 90% of the entities that are listed as start-ups on the
original LEAP database prior to editing would fall under our definition of genuine births.

The edited LEAP database makes corrections for these false births and deaths using the labour-tracking
program that is described above. This procedure removes 10% of the entrants, a figure very close to the
survey estimate of false births. We can, therefore, be relatively confident that the entry and exit
phenomena that are being measured in this paper refer mainly to the creation of new units that have
employment for the first time.
It should be noted that the entry rates that are produced by LEAP and the survey are not quite the same
because they have different coverages, with LEAP being slightly more extensive. The entry rates using
LEAP and the survey are presented in Table E2. It should also be noted that the rates are not calculated
on exactly the same populations. LEAP uses all entities that filed a remittance for 1993 (including those
who do so in the subsequent year). The survey examined a rolling sample during the year and therefore
omitted all new firms that were late filers—those that only file after the end of the year. LEAP also used
a larger frame, including the very smallest firms in the business register—firms that are so small that
formal industry classification procedures are not followed for them except after a lag. The two estimates
give an idea of the nature of the differences that arise because of differences in sample coverage. For the
commercial population being examined here, LEAP gave an entry rate of 15%. The survey, using a
reduced entrant population, produced a rate of 12%.

arametric forms are often used to describe the distribution of event times. In Chapter 5, we calculated
the mean and median survival times of new firms based on a Weibull distribution. The
appropriateness of the Weibull can be evaluated graphically. A Weibull should be linear in the log of—
log(s) and log t. Figures F1 and F2 plot the log negative log of the survivor function against log duration
for the goods and services sectors, respectively. Figures F3 and F4 fit a linear regression line through
these data plots.
