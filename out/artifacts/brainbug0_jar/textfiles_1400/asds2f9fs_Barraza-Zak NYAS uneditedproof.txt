Abstract:

Empathy is related to a variety of prosocial behaviors, but the brain
mechanisms producing the experience of empathy have not been fully

characterized. This study investigated if the experience of empathy would

raise oxytocin levels and affect subsequent generosity towards strangers.

us

Short video clips of an emotional scene and an unemotional scene were
used as stimuli. Participants rated the emotions they experienced and

then played a $40 ultimatum game to gauge their generosity. We found

that empathy was associated with a 47% increase in oxytocin from
baseline. We also found the empathy-oxytocin response was stronger in

1. Introduction
Humans are often aroused by the distress of others. Empathy allows us to
perceive anotherâ€™s affective state and motivates action if the other is perceived to be in
an aversive state.1-3 The enduring interest in empathy across disciplines (as illustrated
by this issue) is due in part to its relationship to moral behaviors as argued by Aristotle
in The Nicomachean Ethics4 and Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments,5 as

ed
un

well as other scholars. Altruism can be considered morally virtuous that has been
associated with empathy.2,6 The experience of empathy has been shown to motivate
prosocial behaviors such as volunteering and donations to charities.7-8

ite

Although much is known about the behavioral outcomes when people are
empathic, the physiologic mechanisms of empathy are not well understood.9,7

d

Specifically, little is known about how observing the aversive states of others translates

m

into the subjective experience of empathy. In addition, the physiologic substrates

an

causing individuals to experience different empathic states such as empathic concern or

us

personal distress when observing aversive states in others is unknown. We propose
that the neurohormone oxytocin may be part of the neural architecture that produces

cr

experienced empathy. Oxytocin (OT) is associated with attachment behaviors in

ip

mammals and we identified it as a likely mechanism that causes human beings to
respond to the affective states of others. Oxytocin is a neuroactive hormone that is

directly synthesized in the hypothalamus and projects to brain areas that are associated
with emotions and social behaviors (e.g., amygdala and cingulate cortex).10 In socially
monogamous mammals, oxytocin mediates prosocial behaviors such as partner
preference, social recognition, parental care, and social approach.11-14

Recent studies in humans have revealed that oxytocin promotes prosocial
behaviors including trust, reciprocity, and generosity measured using monetary
transfers to strangers.15-19 Specifically, OT levels measured in plasma were 41% higher
after a monetary transfer denoting trust was received compared those who are received
a randomly chosen transfer of the same average amount. In these studies, OT levels
were positively associated with increased monetary reciprocity toward the person who

ed
un

initiated trust.17-18 We discovered recently that endogenous OT release and selfsacrificial reciprocity can be magnified by exposing participants to touch prior to making
decisions. Fifteen minutes of moderate pressure massage, compared to controls who

ite

rested for 15 minutes, increased the change in OT after being trusted by 16%, and
increased reciprocity by 243%.20

d

Exogenous OT infusion studies in humans have demonstrated its causal effect

m

on prosocial behaviors. Intranasal infusion of 24IU of OT increased monetary transfers

an

to a stranger denoting trust by 17%.15 Further, in a monetary transfer task that involves

us

making an offer to share a fixed sum of money known as the ultimatum game, 40IU of
intranasal OT increased the generosity of offers by 80% over placebo.19 These studies

cr

show that OT is associated with prosocial behaviors, but leaves open the question of
whether OT is associated with empathy.

2. The Current Study
Herein we report a direct test of whether OT is a proximate mechanism
modulating the subjective experience of empathy. We hypothesized that OT would
spike after exposure to an emotional stimulus and would be associated with the

http://www.nyas.org/forthcoming

<-----Page 5----->Page 5 of 21

experience of two empathic states: personal distress and empathic concern. We also
tested if elevated OT would elicit a prosocial behavior, generosity towards a stranger.
Two behavioral tasks were used to test the empathy-prosociality association, offers in
the ultimatum game and monetary donations to charity. We used the ultimatum game
(UG) as in Zak, Stanton & Ahmadi19 as it requires perspective-taking by participants--a
cognitive exercise that has been as shown to provoke empathy.6,21

3. Materials and Methods

Participants and Procedure

ite

One hundred and forty five college students (52% female, mean age 20.8 years,

d

SD = 3.3) from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) participated in this
study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Emotional Video

m

and UG (EU, n = 61), Control Video and UG (CU, n = 56), or Emotional Video only (E, n

an

= 24). Three participants (one from each condition) were excluded from analyses due to

us

OT levels outside of the acceptable assay range (>2500 pg/ml) at baseline, which is five
standard deviations above the mean.

cr

Participants were recruited by email and earned $10 for agreeing to be part of

ip

the experiment. Total earnings were based on the decision task as discussed below.
After consent, participants were led to a private room for their first blood draw by a

and asked to fill out a survey. Once finished, participants viewed to one of two brief
videos and were asked to rate the degree to which particular emotions were felt.
Participants then played a single round of the UG sequentially for money (except for the

E group). Survey, video, and UG instructions and decisions were made via computer.
No interpersonal communication was permitted. Immediately after the decision in the
UG, a second blood draw was performed for those in the EU and CU groups. The E
group had their second blood draw after viewing the video. After the second blood draw,
participants were privately informed of their study earnings and presented with the
option to donate to a charity. When all tasks were completed, participants were privately

paid by a lab administrator who was not associated with the study. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of UCLA and Claremont Graduate
University. The study was double-blind, and no deception of any kind was used.

Ultimatum Game

d

ite

Participants played a single round of the ultimatum game (UG) to assess

m

generosity towards a stranger.22,19 In the UG, participants were randomly put into dyads

an

and in each dyad were randomly assigned to the role of decision-maker 1 (DM1) or

us

decision-maker 2 (DM2). Both DMs received extensive and identical instructions for the
UG, including examples. In our version of the UG, DM1s were endowed with $40 and

cr

were asked to choose an offer of a split of this money to the DM2 in his or her dyad.

ip

DM2s had no endowment. If DM2 accepted the offer from DM1, both DMs were
subsequently paid the money according to the accepted division. However, both DMs

earned nothing if DM2 rejected the offer from DM1. The UG task is designed to have
participants consider how the DM2 in the dyad would react to an offer (perspectivetaking) since DM2s can reject offers. A rejection of DM1â€™s offer in the UG allows DM2 to
punish DM1 for stinginess, but offers at a cost of the loss of the money offered.

http://www.nyas.org/forthcoming

<-----Page 7----->Page 7 of 21

Although most UG experiments are played with $10,23 a $40 endowment was used in
this experiment as both to compensate participants for two blood draws as well as to
explore whether a parametric relationship existed between DM2 offers and the change
in OT as has been found for DM2s in a related monetary decision task called the trust
game.20,18

Blood draw

ed
un

After consent, all participants had 20ml of blood drawn by a licensed
phlebotomist from an antecubital vein. Two 8-ml EDTA whole-blood tubes and one

ite

serum-separator tube were drawn while maintaining a sterile field and using a
VacutainerÂ©. Those in the EU and CU groups had a 20ml second blood draw

d

immediately following their decision in the UG. Participants were prompted to make their

m

decisions serially so that the decision and blood draw were temporally close, typically

an

occurring within 2 minutes after the decision as in Zak, Kurzban & Matzner.18

us

Participants in the E group received a second 20ml blood draw following viewing and
rating of the emotional video. Blood tubes were immediately placed on ice after being

cr

drawn. The tubes were then placed in a refrigerated centrifuge and spun at 1500 rpm

ip

for 12 minutes at 4C. Plasma and serum were removed from the tubes and placed into
2ml microtubes with screw caps. These tubes were immediately placed on dry ice and

<-----Page 8----->Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences

Five hormones were assayed using either radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Andrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) (plasmaRIA) samples were assayed using a kit produced by DiaSorin, Inc. (Stillwater, MN),
cortisol (serum-RIA) samples by Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (Webster, TX), and
progesterone (serum-RIA) and estradiol (serum-RIA) were assayed with kits from
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. (Los Angeles, CA). Oxytocin was assayed using a

ed
un

competitive ELISA assay from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). The inter- and intraassay coefficients of variations for OT were 7.8% at 484.68 pg/ml and 10.2% at 494.63
pg/ml (10 replicates), respectively. All tests were performed by the Endocrine Core

Video
All participants viewed a 2-minute long video privately in their partitioned
computer stations using headphones. Participants in the EU and E conditions watched
a video in which a father explains his current experiences with his two-year-old son who

has terminal brain cancer. The video includes scenes of the child in the hospital and
with his father who narrates the video clip. Participants in the CU condition watched a
clip similar in length with images of the father and child. However, the narration was of
the father describing a day at the zoo and has no mention of the childâ€™s illness nor does
he express concern for the child.

Video Ratings

At the end of the video, participants were asked to rate the degree to which they
experienced particular emotions while viewing the video. This list included 12 adjectives

ite

previously used to assess empathy toward others5 (e.g., sympathetic, compassion,

d

moved, tender, warm, soft-hearted) and personal distress (e.g., anxious, distressed,
sad, annoyed, frightened, disturbed). Participants rated these adjectives from 1 (did not

feel this way at all) to 5 (felt this way very much). Composite measures were created for

both empathy (Î± = .75) and distress (Î± = .60).

3. Results

<-----Page 10----->Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences

Response to Video
There was no change in OT in those who viewed the emotional video (EU + E:
baseline OT= 474.87 pg/ml, SD= 306.75, post-video OT= 448.91 pg/ml, SD= 288.72,
one-tailed paired t test p = .21, n = 80). There was a significant decrease in OT in those
who viewed the control video (CU: baseline OT= 464.96 pg/ml, SD= 341.90, post-video
OT= 377.64 pg/ml, SD= 250.95; two-tailed paired t test, p = .03). However, separating

ed
un

emotional video conditions we found different results. OT significantly increased among
participants in the E condition who viewed the emotional video but did not play the UG
(baseline OT= 401.83 pg/ml, SD= 230.06, post-video OT= 592.19 pg/ml, SD= 225.34;

ite

two-tailed paired t test, p = .004). Alternatively, there was significant decrease in OT for

d

those who viewed the emotional video and played the UG (EU: baseline OT= 502.57
pg/ml, SD= 328.75, post-video OT= 394.56 pg/ml, SD= 293.08, two-tailed paired t test,

p < .001). As Figure 1 shows, the emotional video increased OT, but not when the
second blood draw followed the UG.

p = .08; EU M = 3.17 p < .001, both one-tailed t tests). Participants in the E and EU
condition reported statistically equal experiences of empathy (p = .63) and distress (p =
.12). See Figure 2.

http://www.nyas.org/forthcoming

<-----Page 11----->Page 11 of 21

Across all conditions, simple correlations did not find a relationship between a
change in OT and subjective empathy (r = .053, p = .28) or distress (r = -.074, p = .21).
But, we discovered a high correlation between self-reported empathy and distress (r =
.81, p < .001). As a result, partial correlations were examined between OT and each
emotion, controlling for the other one. Controlling for these cross-effects, a spike in OT
was significantly associated with increased feelings of empathy (r = .197, p = .01) as

ed
un

well as decreased feelings of distress (r = -.188, p = .02). A hierarchical regression
analysis was conducted to test if empathy and distress predicted a change in OT when
controlling for changes in other hormones (ACTH, cortisol). Changes in hormones

ite

related to OT as well as gender were entered in the first step, followed by empathy and

d

distress video ratings in the second step of the equation. This analysis revealed a
significant overall regression equation, F (5, 118) = 3.09, p < .01. Both empathy (ÃŸ =

m

.294, p < .05) and distress (ÃŸ = -.301, p < .05) were significant predictors of the change

an

in OT in different directions. This result was maintained in separate analyses controlling

us

for basal levels of progesterone or estradiol in women.

Emotional Ratings and Other Hormones

Across all conditions, emotional ratings were not significantly correlated with any
of the hormones (ACTH, cortisol, estradiol, progesterone) at baseline or post-video.

However, when controlling for one another, empathy and distress were significantly

Generosity in UG
Of the participants playing as DM1 (n = 56), 35 (62.5%) offered an equal split, 20
(26%) made unequal offers of $10-19, and 2 made supra-equal offers of $21 and $30.

un

There were a total of 49 participants who participated as DM2s. Of those, only one
person in the EU and one in the CU groups rejected DM1 offers of $10; all other offers
were accepted. DM2s whose offers were rejected were removed from subsequent

ite

analyses. There were no differences in the mean DM1 offers between the EU (M =

d

$18.18, SD= $3.19) and CU conditions (M = $17.62, SD= $4.54, one-tailed t test, p =
.29).

Consistent with our hypothesis, DM1 proposals in the UG were positively

correlated with reported empathy after the video (r = .239, p = .05). There was a weak

relationship between DM1 offers and distress levels (r = .171, p = .11). Similar to
studies of OT in the trust game,18 DM1 behavior was uncorrelated with the change in

Charitable Donations

Forty four (32%) of the participants made monetary donations (M = $6.09, SD =
6.31). Donations were significantly correlated with the amount sent by DM1s (r = .356, p
= .004). Among all participants, donations were positively related to the change in
cortisol (r = .146, p = .05), but were unrelated to the change in OT (r = -.010, p = .45), or
the change in ACTH (r = -.084, p = .18), Donations were not associated with emotional
video ratings (empathy r = -.088, p = .16; distress r = -.080, p = .19).

Gender and Personality

Pooling all conditions, we found that emotional ratings (controlling for one

another) were more strongly associated with changes in OT for women (empathy r =

.245, p = .03, distress r = -.258, p = .02) than for men (empathy r = .158, p = .11,
distress r = -.134, p = .15). Behaviorally, more women made charitable donations than

m

men (23% of men versus 41% of women, Ï‡2 = 4.78, p = .03), and gave more in

an

donations than men (M = $2.89 versus M = $1.08, two-tailed t-test, p = .02). The

us

average amount sent by DM1s was also greater for women than men (women: $18.85,
men: $17.10, one-tailed t-test, p = .05). No personality variables were associated with
basal OT or the change in OT.

There are three main findings of this study. First, viewing an emotional video
raises oxytocin by an average of 47% over baseline as compared to those who watched
an emotionally neutral video. Second, there is a positive relationship between the

http://www.nyas.org/forthcoming

<-----Page 14----->Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences

degree of empathy experienced and the change in OT. Third, an increase in
experienced empathy is associated with greater generosity in the UG.
Past research has purported that emotional videos may induce OT release.28 We
provide the first direct evidence for this claim, and we have demonstrated both a
statistically and quantitatively significant increase in OT after an emotional stimulus.
Even more compelling, we discovered a positive parametric relationship between the

ed
un

experience of empathy and the change in OT. The relationship between empathy and
the change in OT was especially strong for women. The lack of a relationship between
the change in OT when the emotional video was followed by the UG is likely due to the

ite

time lag between the video and the second blood draw, which was required for

d

instructions and UG decisions. The half-life of OT is very short, with estimates of
between 1-2 minutes.29

m

We also reported that the experience of empathy positively influenced

an

prosociality. Participants who were empathically engaged by the video they viewed

us

made more generous offers in the UG. Those who made more generous offers also
donated more money to charity, with this effect associated with physiologic distress (a

cr

positive change in cortisol). Donations were highest among women in the sample. At

ip

the same time, the change in OT was strongest among women. Post-hoc analyses
found that these gender differences were not driven by the upregulation of OT by

estrogen.30
We also found an interesting counteracting effect of distress on OT release.
Empathy and distress were highly related in our sample, and they appear to work
against each other at a physiologic level. Psychologists have also distinguished

http://www.nyas.org/forthcoming

<-----Page 15----->Page 15 of 21

between empathy and distress as motivators to help others.6,21 Batson's empathyaltruism hypothesis6,31 posits that these affective states lead to divergent motivations to
help others. Those who experience distress are motivated to reduce their own aversive
state, while those who experience empathy are focused on relieving the aversive state
of another.32 Our physiologic data support the separation of these two effects in
relations to OT. Interestingly, empathy and distress levels were also associated with

ed
un

changes in cortisol. In animal studies, cortisol suppresses OT release.33 In human
studies the findings are less clear; OT administration suppresses cortisol induced by
social stress,34-35 but cortisol administration increases plasma OT levels.36-37 Our study

ite

showed that cortisol was elevated in people who reported experiencing empathy, while

d

it declined in those reporting distress.

This study indicates that OT is a physiologic signature for empathy and

m

modulates two types of prosocial behaviors, generosity in the UG and charitable

an

donations. These findings identify a proximate mechanism that explains why humans
help each other--even at a cost to themselves.
