PERSONALITY AND ATTITUDINAL CORRELATES OF TRUSTING
AND TRUSTWORTHY BEHAVIORS IN A
TWO-PERSON GAME
LAWRENCE S. WRIGHTSMANi
George Peabody College for Teachers
2 experiments were completed, with the purposes of determining (a) if personality and attitudinal variables might be related to extent of trusting and
trustworthy behaviors in a 2-person non-zero-sum game, and (b) if playing
for moderate sums of real money would produce the same behaviors as
playing for imaginary money. Scores on the Philosophies of Human Nature
Scale were related to trusting behavior; persons who believe human nature to
be altruistic, trustworthy, and independent behaved in the game situation in
more trusting ways than did Ss with unfavorable attitudes about human
nature. No attitude or personality variable was found to be related to trustworthy behavior in the game. In each experiment, playing for real vs. imaginary payoffs had little influence on S's game behavior.
A recent review by Gallo and McCHntock
(1965) draws several conclusions about the
present state of research on cooperative and
competitive behaviors in a non-zero-sum game.
One conclusion is that the number of personality
and attitudinal variables which have been shown
to be related to cooperative (or trusting) behavior in the game is limited. Second, the review
finds no studies which used large, actual monetary rewards as incentives to the players.
The present study attempts to fill these gaps.
Its purposes are twofold: to detect some of the
attitudinal and personality correlates of trusting
and trustworthy behaviors in an interpersonal
situation, and to determine whether the expectation of winning real money (versus playing for
imaginary money) influences the frequency of
trusting and trustworthy behaviors in a twoperson non-zero-sum game.
In relating attitudes to game behavior, Deutsch
(1960) found that authoritarianism was negatively related to extent of trusting and trustworthy behaviors in a two-person game, and
Lutzker (1960) found that attitudes favoring
internationalism rather than isolationism were
related to cooperative or trusting behaviors.
Marlowe (1963) related scores on an adjective
check list to Prisoner's Dilemma game behavior
and found that cooperative subjects scored higher
on need Abasement (p = .07) and Deference
(/> = .02), while noncooperative subjects scored

higher on need Aggression (p = .06) and
Autonomy (p = .03).
These findings, meager as they are, have been
based on game situations where the monetary
rewards were either imaginary or very small. For
example, the payoff matrix in Marlowe's 30-trial
study (which used impecunious first-year medical
students) ranged from 0 to $.04 per trial.
Deutsch used larger numbers, but the payoffs
were imaginary.
Apparently only two studies have varied the
value of rewards. One of these did not use the
traditional Prisoner's Dilemma game, but rather
a conceptually similar procedure, the simulated
trucker's game, developed by Deutsch and
Krauss (1962). Subjects playing for imaginary
money lost an average of $38.80 per dyad
over 20 trials, while subjects playing for large
amounts of real money won an average of $9.92
per dyad. Thus game behavior was much different, and much more cooperative, when real
money was involved.
Evans (1964) assessed the value of the matrix
entries in the Prisoner's Dilemma game by using
imaginary money in one condition and points to
be added to the subject's examination score in
the other condition. Over the six trials, no significant differences in number of cooperative responses between conditions were found. Evans
concludes that "tentatively, it is safe to generalize from game situations in which the rewards
are small or imaginary to situations where the
payoff of an outcome is of a moderate value,
at least [p. 590]." This conclusion is quite
opposite to that of Gallo (1963).

METHOD
Two experiments were completed, each using
undergraduates at George Peabody College as subjects. Subjects participated as part of their course
requirements in general psychology. When each
arrived, he was told that he was to participate in
a study of choice behavior and had "the opportunity to win some money," in addition to receiving
experimental credit. In both experiments, subjects
worked as pairs, although unseen to one another.
Each subject participated in a two-person, non-zerosum game in which the amount of gains for each
person was determined by his choice and that of
the other subject. The procedure is similar to that
used by Deutsch (1960), except that different
amounts of money were used.
Three conditions were employed in the game situation, with 28 subjects participating in each condition.
In the real-money condition subjects were told that
they could keep whatever they won. (Postexperimental questioning indicated that 90% of the subjects believed this.) Subjects in this condition could
then receive as much as $12 for 30 minutes' participation. In the imaginary-money condition subjects were told that they were playing "for fun"
and that no money would be paid. In the noinformation condition, they were not told whether
they would be allowed to keep their winnings or
not. (On postexperimental questioning, 75% of the
subjects in this condition expected that they would
not be allowed to keep their winnings.)
In Experiment I, subjects participated in two
trials. On the first, they were presented the
data in Figure 1. Each subject chose first (i.e.,
either X or V), knowing that the other subject
would know his choice before choosing. On the
second trial, each subject was told the first choice
of the other person, and then chose second. If the
other subject did not appear for the experiment,
the subject was told that the other subject had
chosen X. (This happened in IS cases.) Thus each
person had an opportunity on the first trial to show,
in Deutsch's terms, his trusting or suspicious behavior. The second trial gave a test of the person's
trustworthiness in the case when the first person
had chosen X. After each choice, the subject was
asked why he had chosen as he did and what he
expected the other person would choose or why
the other person had chosen as he did.
One month prior to participating in the above,
subjects in Experiment I were administered the
following instruments which measure variables possibly related to game behavior: Verbal Hostility

X ($3, $3)
Y ($6, $0)

B

($0, $6)

subscale of the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory
(Buss, 1962); Rchfisch (1958) Rigidity Scale; revised Social Responsibility Scale (Berkowitz &
Daniels, 1964) ; Personal Optimism and Anti-Police
Attitudes scales (Chein, 2 ); the California F Scale
(Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, & Sanford,
1950); the Political Cynicism Scale (Agger, Goldstein, & Pearl, 1961) ; and the Philosophies of Human
Nature Scale (Wrightsman, 1964).
In Experiment II, the same procedure was used,
with the exception of the following three modifications:
1. All 56 subjects were female. (In Experiment I,
15 males and 69 females were used.)
2. Several additional attitude and personality
measures were used in Experiment II, as follows:
Machiavellianism Scale (Christie & Merton, 1958)
and the social desirability scales developed by
Crowne and Marlowe (1960) and by Edwards
(1957). Also given were some of those measures
used in the first experiment (Personal Optimism
Scale, Anti-Police Attitudes Scale, F Scale, and
Philosophies of Human Nature Scale).
3. In Experiment II, each subject chose first (i.e.,
between X and Y) two times. On one of these he
was told that he would keep whatever he won;
on the other he was told he would not be allowed
to keep whatever he had won. Before making his
second choice, he was not told what the other subject
had chosen. Order of conditions was randomized
across the 56 subjects.
In both experiments, subjects were classified as
trusting or distrusting on the basis of their choice
on the first trial (X or Y), their expectation of
the other's choice (A or B), and the reasons they
gave for their choice and their expectation of the
other's choice. The criterion of trusting behavior
was met when the subject chose X, expected the
other person to choose A (i.e., to cooperate), and
gave as his reasons for this a concept of trust,
fairness, or cooperation. Any choice of Y, or the
choice of X with the expectation that the other
would pick B, was classified as distrusting, when the
person gave as his reason distrust or fear of the
other's response. If he chose Y and gave as his
reason "equality," "planning," or "safety," he was
classified as neither trusting nor distrusting.
Trustworthy behavior was considered as present
when the subject chose A after the other subject had
chosen X. Untrustworthy behavior was defined as
choosing B after the other had chosen X, If the
first person had chosen Y, it was felt that the second
person's response could not be used to gauge trustworthiness or lack of it. Hence the number of subjects for the analysis of trustworthiness in Experiment I is reduced to 42. (In the case where the
first person had chosen Y, all but 5 of the remaining
42 chose B.)

RESULTS
In both experiments, the frequency of trusting
behavior was not greatly influenced by playing

for real versus imaginary money. In Experiment I, the number of trusting subjects (among
28 per condition) was 9 in the real-money condition, 10 in the no-information condition, and
8 in the imaginary-money condition. In Experiment II, where each subject played under both
conditions, 6 of 56 subjects (11%) chose differently under real versus imaginary payoffs.
In 4 of these 6, the subject was not willing to
trust under real-money conditions but was willing
when no real payoff was involved. Likewise, frequency of trustworthy behavior in Experiment I
did not significantly vary across conditions. Many
subjects in the imaginary-money condition in

Experiment I commented that they would have
behaved the same way if real payoffs had been
involved.
Table 1 presents mean differences on attitude and personality measures among trusting
(N = 27), distrusting (TV =19), and other subjects (N = 38) in Experiment I. On the Philosophies of Human Nature Scale, trusting subjects had more generally positive attitudes
toward human nature (p < .05) and saw people
as more trustworthy (p < .05), more altruistic
(p < .05), and more independent (p < .05) than
did distrusting subjects and other subjects. These
findings confirmed expectations. In each of these

comparisons, the order was as follows: trusting
subjects most favorable toward human nature,
unclassified subjects as next most favorable, and
distrusting subjects as least favorable. No other
attitude or personality measures were significantly
related to trusting behavior in Experiment I.
Using the criterion described in the Method
section, 27 subjects in Experiment I were classified as trustworthy and IS were classified as
untrustworthy. As predictors of trustworthy or
untrustworthy behavior in the same situation,
none of the attitude or personality measures
was successful, As Table 2 indicates, mean scores
for the trustworthy and untrustworthy subjects
in Experiment I were not significantly different
on any of the measures. Differences on the five
measures of Philosophies of Human Nature were
all in the expected direction, but none came
close to statistical significance. Of the 27 trustworthy subjects, on the first trial 8 had been
trusting, 5 distrusting, and 14 neither; of the
15 untrustworthy subjects, none had been trusting, 4 had been distrusting, and 11 had been
neither. Thus every trusting subject whose trustworthiness was tested responded in that way
whereas only half of the other subjects responded
in a trustworthy way. The small number of
trusting subjects in this group prevents further
analysis.
In Experiment II, few of the attitude and
personality variables were significantly related to
trusting or distrusting behavior in the game.
Table 3 summarizes the findings. In general, the

331

"other" subjects (neither trusting nor distrusting)
had more and greater political cynicism and less
positive attitudes. Trusting subjects had, as in
Experiment I, more favorable views of human
nature, but the levels of significance were lower
(P < .05 for general positiveness, and for trustworthiness, and nonsignificant differences on the
other three dimensions), and the order of the
three groups was not consistent with that of
Experiment I. In Experiment II, trusting and
distrusting subjects' means were similar, with
the trusting subjects being nonsignificantly more
favorable. The "other" subjects were significantly
less favorable and less trusting in their attitudes
toward human nature than were the subjects who
were either trusting or distrusting in the game,
DISCUSSION
The findings of these two experiments seem
to confirm Evans' (1964) conclusion that the size
of reward has little effect on the subject's game
behavior. The great limitation in the experiments
described here is that they did not extend beyond
two trials. Whether such similarities in game
behavior between conditions of real versus imaginary payoffs exist in further trials needs to be
studied, as Gallo (1963) found differences, between conditions, as extent of cooperation in the
trucker's game increased in the later trials.
The number of attitude and personality variables which significantly relate to game behavior
seems to be limited to those which are conceptually quite similar to game behavior, that is,

philosophies of human nature, and to some
extent, political cynicism. Despite its apparent
simplicity, the game situation evokes a variety
of orientations and reactions in different subjects.
Some see the game as a competition and thus
interpret the purpose of it to win as much as
they can, while others focus on the partnership
aspect and feel constrained to share. These varying orientations brought to the situation may
cause the lack of relationship between such
characteristics as social responsibility or personal
optimism and trusting behavior in the game.
However, the relationships with attitudes toward
human nature do indicate that the particular
orientation one "happens upon" is somewhat related to his basic beliefs about people in general.
The relationships between attitudes and game
behavior were only partly consistent between
Experiment I and Experiment II. In both cases,
trusting subjects had more favorable attitudes,
but the relative position of distrusting and other
subjects shifted. The findings for Experiment I
are consistent with expectations. Why, in Experiment II, do subjects who distrust in the game
have attitudes more like the trusting subjects
than the other subjects? The extent of trusting
behavior in Experiment I (32%) was similar
to that on the first trial in Experiment II
(39%). Mean scores for subjects in the two
experiments (see Tables 1 and 2) were similar.
Instructions to the subjects on the first trials
of the two experiments were the same. Most
of the subjects in Experiment I, and all in
Experiment II, were females. Several subjects
in Experiment II reported hearing that they
"would have a chance to win $3" prior to their
coming to the game session, and this may have
led to the increased choice of X and some reduction of the relationships between behavior and
attitudes. It appears that further study needs to
be given to the reasons for choices of X or Y
in two-person games.
Although this study failed to confirm Deutsch's
(1960) finding that authoritarianism was related
to trusting and trustworthy behavior, results were
generally in the direction of agreement with his
findings. The discrepancy may lie in the method
of classification. If, in Experiment I, one classifies all those choosing X and expecting the
other person to choose A as trusting (TV = 27)
and compares this mean with the mean of all the
other 57 subjects (those choosing Y or those
with X and an expectation of B), the two means
are significantly different (t = 1.99, p < .OS) and

in the expected direction. This is, in essence,
what was done in Deutsch's study. The refinement derived from a three-way classification
removes the significance.
