Abstract
Entrepreneurs are more susceptible to certain cognitive biases than are managers who are not
entrepreneurs, but it is not clear why. In an effort to help explain why, I examine differences in the
degree to which entrepreneurs exhibit the overconfidence bias. Results show that individual age, firm
decision comprehensiveness and external equity funding affect the degree to which entrepreneurs are
overconfident. In addition, founder-managers are shown to be more overconfident than are newventure managers who did not found their firms. The results suggest that entrepreneurs’ cognitive
biases are a function of both individual and contextual factors.

1. Executive summary
Cognitive biases are thought processes that involve erroneous inferences or assumptions.
An example of a cognitive bias is the bease of recallQ bias: events that are especially recent or
vivid are easier to recall from memory, so people tend to overestimate the actual frequency of
such events. Biases of this sort are a natural and common phenomenon. Most people exhibit
cognitive biases in their thinking. To some extent, these biases represent shortcuts that enable
us to deal quickly with the large volumes of information that confront us in daily life.

However, biases can also get in the way of effective decision making. If we make major
decisions based on biased thinking, we may make major mistakes that could have been
avoided if we had been able to recognize our biases and improve our decision making with
more information or more careful analysis.
Past research has shown that entrepreneurs are more susceptible to certain cognitive biases
than are managers who are not entrepreneurs. One specific bias for which this has been shown
to be true is the overconfidence bias. The overconfidence bias refers to the tendency of people
to overestimate the correctness of their initial estimates in answering moderate to difficult
questions. In other words, tests that reveal the existence of this bias provide a measure of the
degree to which people bdo not know what they do not knowQ.
It is not clear why entrepreneurs exhibit more overconfidence than nonentrepreneurs are.
Two possible explanations have been advanced. The first holds that entrepreneurship attracts
a bcertain kind of peopleQ, specifically, people who are less formal and rational in their
thinking and more inclined to favor instinct and spontaneous insight—to follow their
hunches, so to speak. The second explanation holds that entrepreneurs resort to cognitive
biases as a response to certain conditions associated with the task of entrepreneurship, such as
information overload, high uncertainty and high time pressure. Research has not yet provided
an answer as to which of these explanations is correct.
In an effort to shed some light on this question, this study examines differences in the
degree to which different entrepreneurs exhibit the overconfidence bias. Specifically, the
study tests whether differences in overconfidence are associated with certain individual
differences and with differences in the organizational contexts in which entrepreneurs
operate. The results of this study show that individual age, firm decision comprehensiveness
and external equity funding affect the degree to which entrepreneurs are overconfident. In
addition, founder-managers are shown to be more overconfident than are new-venture
managers who did not found their firms. These results suggest that entrepreneurs’ cognitive
biases are a function of both individual and contextual factors.
The finding that entrepreneurs’ cognitive biases vary with contextual factors indicates that
their tendency to exhibit cognitive biases is not rooted in binnateQ preferences and, therefore,
is not unchangeable. This implies that educators and practitioners may be able to undertake
interventions designed to help entrepreneurs to think and make decisions better in their
capacity as new-venture managers. For example, consultants or investors could draw upon the
many books, exercises and teaching materials that have been developed (by Max Bazerman,
Paul Schoemaker, Zur Shapira and others) to help educate managers about cognitive biases
and improve their decision making. The first step towards interventions of this sort is
identifying which particular entrepreneurs are most likely to be susceptible to these biases,
and the findings of this study take us some distance towards that goal.

2. Introduction
Recent research in entrepreneurship has shown that entrepreneurs are more likely than
nonentrepreneurs to exhibit certain cognitive biases and heuristics. For example, Palich and

<-----Page 2----->D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

625

Bagby (1995) found that entrepreneurs were more likely to categorize equivocal business
situations positively than were nonentrepreneurs. Busenitz and Barney (1997) found that
entrepreneurs exhibited a greater reliance on the overconfidence bias and the representativeness heuristic than did ordinary managers. Kaish and Gilad (1991) found that entrepreneurs
scan for information more actively in their off-hours and use more nonverbal, nontraditional
sources of information than do ordinary managers. Drawing together findings of this sort,
Busenitz and Lau (1996) developed the umbrella term bentrepreneurial cognitionQ to refer to
the set of cognitive processes that such studies identify as being characteristic of
entrepreneurs. These studies have answered some important research questions, but they
underscore another question that remains open: Why do entrepreneurs think differently from
nonentrepreneurs? At least two answers to this question have been proposed.
One answer holds that the cognitive processes associated with entrepreneurial cognition
are quasi-traits that become characteristic of entrepreneurs through a self-selection process. In
other words, people who think in certain ways tend to be attracted to entrepreneurship.
Busenitz and Barney (1997) favor this explanation. They contend that bthose who are more
susceptible to the use of biases and heuristics in decision making are the very ones who are
most likely to become entrepreneursQ, whereas bthe more cautious decision makers will tend
to be attracted to larger organizations where more methodical information tends to be more
readily availableQ (p. 14). This explanation acknowledges the contextual differences that
distinguish entrepreneurship from the management of larger firms by identifying those
differences as drivers of the self-selection process. However, this view also locates the
ultimate source of entrepreneurial cognition within the individual him/herself. That is, this
view holds that some individuals are inherently more bsusceptibleQ to decision biases or,
alternatively, are bmore cautiousQ decision makers.
An alternative explanation for entrepreneurial cognition is that cognitive biases are induced
in decision makers by aspects of the entrepreneurial experience. Baron (1998) has argued for
this explanation. He suggested that entrepreneurs take cognitive shortcuts as a response to
certain conditions associated with the task of entrepreneurship, such as information overload,
high uncertainty and high time pressure. This perspective implies that entrepreneurial
cognition is not rooted primarily in individual differences and is instead, at least partly, a
function of contextual factors faced by the entrepreneur. As Baron (1998) puts it, bdifferences
in cognition do not stem primarily from differences between entrepreneurs and other people
with respect to personal traits (although such differences may well exist), but rather from the
fact that entrepreneurs operate in situations and under conditions that would be expected to
maximize such errors or biasesQ (p. 288).
Each of these alternative explanations has some plausibility. However, empirical support
for either of the proposed explanations remains lacking. Some light can be shed on these
issues by studying whether and how entrepreneurs think differently from one another.
Evidence that entrepreneurs’ cognitive processes do not differ significantly or that their
differences are related to other individual-level characteristics would support Busenitz and
Barney’s (1997) trait-like explanation for entrepreneurial cognition. On the other hand,
evidence that significant differences in entrepreneurs’ cognitive processes are associated with
differences in the organizational contexts within which entrepreneurs operate would support

<-----Page 3----->626

D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

the situational view of Baron (1998). In the remainder of this article, I evaluate the relative
strength of these explanations by proposing and testing a set of individual and organizational
determinants of a specific manifestation of entrepreneurial cognition: overconfidence.

3. Overconfidence: its meaning and significance
Overconfidence is a decision-making bias that emanates from the banchoring and
adjustmentQ heuristic and refers to the tendency of people to overestimate the correctness of
their initial estimates in answering moderate to difficult questions (Bazerman, 1994). To
paraphrase Lichtenstein and Fischoff (1977), the overconfidence score provides a measure of
the degree to which people bdo not know what they do not knowQ. Many studies conceive of
overconfidence as a widespread cognitive bias and not as something that varies across
individuals. However, research has shown that some individuals exhibit higher levels of
overconfidence than others do (e.g., Keren, 1987; Simon and Houghton, 2003; Yates et al.,
1998). Building on this insight, Busenitz and Barney (1997) found that entrepreneurs were
more overconfident than ordinary managers.
Entrepreneurial overconfidence is usually thought to be of interest in connection with
entrepreneurs’ initial decisions to start new ventures. For example, Dosi and Lovallo’s (1997)
characterization of entrepreneurs as boptimistic martyrsQ is based on their observation of the
probabilistically poor but socially useful gamble made by individuals who create new
ventures. Understanding the sources of overconfidence can help to explain this important
entrepreneurial behavior. But overconfidence has also been shown to influence a variety of
managerial behaviors, such as forecasting (Hogarth and Makridakis, 1981) and negotiation
(Bazerman and Neale, 1982), that many entrepreneurs perform as they continue to manage
their firms for years after the founding event (Willard et al., 1992). Thus, overconfidence
probably affects not only how entrepreneurs found their ventures but also how they behave in
their capacities as managers of those ventures. For example, overconfidence may influence
how entrepreneurs respond to new information and events and the way they represent their
ventures’ prospects to others, such as potential customers and strategic partners. There is
some empirical evidence that overconfidence may have important strategic implications of
this kind. Simon and Houghton (2003), for example, showed that managers who exhibited
higher levels of overconfidence were more likely to make product introductions that were
more risky and less likely to succeed. In addition, a case study by Guth et al. (1991) showed
that firm performance can suffer when managerial decisions reflect a lack of congruence
between entrepreneurs’ perceptions of the environment and actual environmental conditions.

4. Clarifications
In the sections that follow, I propose some individual and organizational determinants of
overconfidence. Before doing so, however, I offer two points of clarification. First,
throughout this article, I use boverconfidenceQ to refer to people’s ability to estimate the

<-----Page 4----->D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

627

accuracy of their own knowledge, as that ability has been measured in the aforementioned
literature. Strictly speaking, the measure can reveal people to be underconfident instead of
overconfident. However, the measure reveals most people to be overconfident, thus, for the
sake of simplicity, I discuss variations along this construct by referring to higher and lower
levels of overconfidence. Second, I use the term bnew-venture managerQ to refer to both
founder and nonfounder managers of new ventures. In keeping with much of the
entrepreneurship literature, I use the term bentrepreneurQ to refer only to new-venture
managers who are founders. All but one of the following hypotheses are concerned with
variations in cognition among entrepreneurs; only the first hypothesis is also concerned with
nonfounder managers of new ventures.

5. Individual factors associated with overconfidence
In attempting to identify the effects of individual factors on the presence of entrepreneurial
cognition, it is instructive to consider the distinction between founder and nonfounder managers
of new ventures. Following a logic similar to that advanced by Busenitz and Barney (1997), one
might argue that management positions in new ventures would tend to attract individuals who
already bthink like entrepreneursQ and that, consequently, there should be little difference
between the cognitive processes of founder and nonfounder managers of new ventures.
However, in hiring nonfounder managers, new ventures commonly seek people who have
experience in managing larger, more established organizations, and the findings of Busenitz and
Barney (1997) would lead us to expect such individuals to have cognitive processes that differ
from those of founders. On the other hand, if Baron’s (1998) logic were followed to an extreme,
one could argue that there should be little difference between new-venture managers who have
founded their firms and those who are simply managing new ventures that others have founded,
because both sets of new-venture managers face conditions akin to those to which Baron
attributed entrepreneurial cognition. However, individual cognitive profiles are likely to be at
least moderately stable and are not likely to change immediately in response to changes in
conditions. For these reasons, it is likely that nonfounder managers will think more like largefirm managers than like entrepreneurs. Specifically, nonfounder managers are likely to be less
susceptible to cognitive biases like overconfidence.
Hypothesis 1. New-venture managers who founded their ventures will be more overconfident
than will be those who did not.
Demographic differences among entrepreneurs may also account for differences in the
degree to which they are overconfident. For example, individuals’ ages have been shown to
affect their cognitive processes (Hagestad and Neugarten, 1985). Many past studies in the
management literature have theorized about the effects of age on certain managerial
decision situations, such as responses to takeover attempts (Buchholtz and Ribbens, 1994)
or acquisitions (Grimm and Smith, 1991). Considerably fewer studies have examined the
influence of managers’ ages on their cognitive processes. However, Taylor (1975) found
that older managers sought more information and took longer to make a decision than did

<-----Page 5----->628

D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

younger managers. His study also showed that older managers were less confident and
more equivocal about their decisions than younger managers were once they had made
them. Consistent with the general theme of Taylor’s findings, I expect that younger
entrepreneurs are likely to be more overconfident than older ones are. Younger
entrepreneurs have had less time to recognize and correct these biases in themselves. By
contrast, older entrepreneurs will, on average, have experienced more failures, judgmental
errors and other instances in which the inaccuracy of their own knowledge has been made
apparent to them, and these experiences are likely to temper their tendency to overestimate
the accuracy of their own knowledge.
Hypothesis 2. Younger entrepreneurs will be more overconfident than will be older
entrepreneurs.
Susceptibility to the cognitive biases associated with entrepreneurial cognition may also
vary based on what entrepreneurs believe about themselves—in particular, on the extent to
which they believe that they bhave what it takesQ to be an entrepreneur. This belief is captured
by the construct of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE), which captures the degree to which
individuals believe that they are capable of performing the tasks associated with new-venture
management (Chen et al., 1998). Overconfidence and ESE are both based on estimations of
personal ability, but they also differ in several important ways. First, the overconfidence bias
measures the accuracy of an ability, whereas ESE measures only what people believe about
their abilities. Relatedly, overconfidence is almost always an unconscious phenomenon,
whereas ESE is often a consciously held belief. Finally, the overconfidence bias is concerned
with people’s ability to make judgments about their knowledge and, therefore, has relevance
in a variety of domains, whereas ESE refers to people’s ability to perform a particular set of
identifiable tasks within a specific domain. Thus, overconfidence and ESE are distinct
constructs. However, there are reasons to expect that they are related.
Understanding the relationship between ESE and overconfidence requires an appreciation
of the fact that people may possess high levels of ESE for different reasons. For some
entrepreneurs, high levels of ESE may reflect a generally inflated set of beliefs about personal
ability—one which stems, perhaps, from an inflated sense of overall self-esteem. In such
cases, measures that assess actual ability, as overconfidence does, are likely to reveal the
exaggerations inherent in inflated self-appraisals. Clearly, however, other people are justified
in possessing a high sense of ESE. Certain experienced entrepreneurs are most likely to
qualify in this regard. These individuals are also likely to be more overconfident because their
past behaviors (i.e., having repeatedly chosen to start a new business) help to identify them as
individuals whose own cognitive profile fits well with the demands of entrepreneurial activity
(Wright et al., 1997a). It might be argued that entrepreneurs with past exposure to the
challenges of entrepreneurship would temper their judgments about their own knowledge and
be less susceptible to the overconfidence bias. However, venture capitalists have reported that
serial entrepreneurs are actually less able to recognize their own limitations than first-time
entrepreneurs (Wright et al., 1997b). More generally, Whyte et al. (1997) found that
individuals with high levels of self-efficacy with regard to risk taking were more likely to
escalate commitment to a losing course of action.

Hypothesis 3. Entrepreneurs with higher levels of ESE will be more overconfident than will
be those with lower levels of ESE.

6. Organizational factors associated with overconfidence
The conditions that may increase entrepreneurs’ susceptibility to cognitive biases derive, in
part, from the organizational context within which entrepreneurs function. However, new
ventures can vary in ways that are likely to affect entrepreneurs’ susceptibility to cognitive
biases. For example, as organizations increase in size and age, the challenges that
entrepreneurs face in managing them become less bentrepreneurialQ and more generally
bmanagerialQ in nature (Hambrick and Crozier, 1985). As this occurs, entrepreneurs are likely
to begin to think in ways that more closely resemble those of managers in larger firms.
Conditions of information overload and uncertainty, for example, are likely to be greater in
smaller new ventures than in larger new ventures, because smaller ventures are likely to have
fewer human and financial resources available to devote to scanning and processing
environmental information. Entrepreneurs managing small ventures are likely to bear many
organizational information-processing responsibilities themselves and, therefore, are more
likely to adopt cognitive shortcuts, such as the overconfidence bias, to adapt to these
conditions. However, as firms grow, it becomes increasingly possible (and sometimes
necessary) for entrepreneurs to delegate or at least share these cognitive responsibilities with
other managers and employees. By doing this, entrepreneurs relieve some of the pressure that
makes them susceptible to cognitive biases.
Similarly, conditions of high novelty are likely to be greater in younger firms than in older
ones. Whereas established organizations tend to have developed precedents and routines to
guide managers’ sense-making activities, the relative absence of such institutionalized
practices in very young ventures means that the entrepreneurs managing such firms must rely
heavily on their own perceptions and interpretive abilities in decision situations (Gartner et
al., 1992). Thus, entrepreneurs are likely to be especially susceptible to cognitive biases in the
earliest years of a venture’s existence. However, this susceptibility is likely to diminish as the
venture ages and develops uncertainty-reducing frameworks for interpreting environmental
data.
Hypothesis 4. Entrepreneurs managing smaller ventures will be more overconfident than will
be entrepreneurs managing larger ventures.
Hypothesis 5. Entrepreneurs managing younger ventures will be more overconfident than
will be entrepreneurs managing older ventures.
Despite these hypothesized effects, the ways that organizations gather and process
information are not entirely a function of age and size. The construct of decision
comprehensiveness captures the extensiveness with which organizations scan, analyze and
plan in confronting decision situations (Dean and Sharfman, 1993). Although comprehensiveness is often correlated with size and age (Fredrickson and Iaquinto, 1989), it is also

<-----Page 7----->630

D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

independent of these factors to some extent and has been shown to vary across new ventures
(Smith et al., 1988). Comprehensiveness at the organizational level is likely to render
entrepreneurs less susceptible to cognitive biases like overconfidence. In firms that scan,
analyze and plan extensively, entrepreneurs are more likely to be confronted with information
that contradicts their initial estimates and to participate in strategic discussions that challenge
them to explain their opinions and verify their assumptions.
Hypothesis 6. Entrepreneurs whose firms exhibit higher levels of decision comprehensiveness will be less overconfident than will be entrepreneurs whose firms are less
comprehensive.
Another organizational factor that is likely to influence entrepreneurial cognition is the
presence of external investors. When firms have external equity financing, the investors will
monitor the behavior of the entrepreneurs managing these firms and hold them accountable
for their decisions. This fact has two important implications. First, in such circumstances,
entrepreneurs will probably be required to explicitly articulate and rationally defend their
cognitive processes with more frequency and intensity than would otherwise be the case
(Frydman et al., 2002). Consistent with this reasoning, Stone and Brush (1996) found in their
review of research on strategic planning processes in new ventures that the presence of
influential external constituencies, such as equity investors, led to higher levels of formal
planning. Second, to the extent that entrepreneurs begin to anticipate the regular need to
explain and justify their decisions, they may begin to internalize the concerns of their
investors and incorporate them into their own cognitive processing, perhaps by analyzing
information more carefully or by double-checking the accuracy of their own estimates. Taken
together, these factors are likely to encourage entrepreneurs with external equity backing to
think more like large-firm managers.
Hypothesis 7. Entrepreneurs whose firms have attracted external equity investments will be
less overconfident than will be entrepreneurs whose firms have not.

7. Method
7.1. Sample
The model was tested using a sample of new-venture managers drawn from New York
City’s bSilicon AlleyQ community of Internet firms. For the purposes of this research, new
ventures were defined to be independent firms (i.e., not subsidiaries or divisions) that
represented the full-time job of at least one person. A strong effort was made to obtain a
representative sample of the firms that met these criteria.
The sample selection process began with Web-based yellow pages telephone directory
listings of all firms in relevant business categories (e.g., bInternet servicesQ and bmultimediaQ)
in the New York metropolitan area. In addition, because these were Internet-related firms,
virtually all of them had websites. The websites of all firms in the yellow pages listings were

<-----Page 8----->D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

631

analyzed in an effort to screen out inappropriate firms, such as divisions of larger firms or
businesses that were geographically distant, part-time or defunct. These website analyses
yielded an initial sample of 719 firms. Although many firms’ websites provide the data
necessary to make determinations about their appropriateness for the sample, not all of them
do. Therefore, to maximize the representativeness of the sample, firms were included in the
initial sample, unless it could be definitively determined from their websites that they were
inappropriate. This meant that the initial sample of 719 firms included some inappropriate
firms. However, the survey gathered information that permitted those firms to be identified
and excluded from the final sample. As a consequence, the response rate reported is a
conservative estimate.
7.2. Data collection
The data were collected through a two-stage survey. In July 1999, I began Stage 1 by
sending a questionnaire to the lead manager of each firm in the initial sample. The
questionnaire gathered data on the managers’ firms, the firms’ decision-making processes and
the managers’ cognitive processes. Three months later, 142 responses (20% of 719) had been
returned. Twenty-seven of these responses revealed that the firms were actually not
independent or were only part-time enterprises, leaving 115 usable responses to Stage 1.
The potential for nonresponse bias was explored in two ways. The first procedure was
based on the work of Armstrong and Overton (1977), who argued that the characteristics of
late respondents are similar to those of nonrespondents. The responses were divided into two
groups representing those received before and after the median response date. Analyses of
variance revealed no significant differences between these groups on any of the independent,
dependent or control variables. The second procedure involved gathering archival data on a
randomly selected subset (20%) of nonrespondent firms from the original sample for
comparison purposes. Again, no significant differences were found between respondents and
nonrespondents.
For Stage 2, I administered a short, follow-up online questionnaire in February 2000 to
the Stage 1 respondents. This questionnaire gathered data on the entrepreneurs’
backgrounds, including whether they were founders, and the firms’ sources of financing.
Ninety-two subjects responded to this survey. Publicly available archival data sources,
such as firms’ websites and local trade publications, were used to supplement and confirm
the survey data whenever possible. The final data set included 108 firms and their
managers.
7.3. Measures
The dependent variable, overconfidence, was measured using a procedure similar to that
used in Busenitz and Barney (1997). Brenner et al. (1996) recently affirmed that this
procedure, which is bthe oldest and simplest measure of overconfidence[,] provides a valid
measure for diagnosing over/underconfidence that does not depend on the mode of analysisQ
(p. 214). The procedure involves recording subjects’ responses to a series of general

<-----Page 9----->632

D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

knowledge questions representing a moderate to high level of difficulty. For this study,
subjects were presented with a series of five such questions. Subjects were asked to choose
one of two available answers for each question and to indicate, on a scale ranging from 50%
to 100%, their confidence in their answer. As an example, one of the questions asked subjects,
bWhich is farther from Chicago: Rome or Honolulu?Q
It should be recalled that the procedure is not meant to be a test of knowledge but rather a
test of subjects’ awareness of the limits of their own knowledge, or a test of the degree to
which they bknow what they do not knowQ. An assessment of this general ability does not
require the subjects to evaluate their knowledge of any particular subject matter. In fact, the
measurement technique is better able to capture this general estimation ability when the
influence of variations in the underlying knowledge bases of the subjects is minimized.
Therefore, difficult general knowledge questions about which few subjects are likely to be
highly knowledgeable, or about which the possession of deep knowledge is likely to be
randomly distributed, are, for this purpose, preferable to subject-specific questions, such as
those about business management, about which certain respondents are likely to have
accumulated in-depth expertise.
Two figures were calculated for each respondent: (1) the mean of the confidence levels
indicated for all questions, and (2) the percentage of items answered correctly. Measures of
overconfidence were then obtained by subtracting the percentage of correct answers from the
average confidence level. The resulting numerical scores had a potential range of 50 to 100,
with positive scores indicating overconfidence and negative scores indicating underconfidence. For example, an individual whose indicated confidence levels averaged 75%
and who answered 40% of the questions correctly was assigned an overconfidence score of
35. A zero score was interpreted to indicate that individuals’ confidence was perfectly
calibrated with their knowledge.
7.3.1. Individual determinants
Founder status was a dummy variable set to b1Q for managers who reported having played
a founding role in their firms and b0Q for managers who reported that they had not played
such a role. Entrepreneurs reported their age in years. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy was
measured using an adaptation of Chen et al.’s (1998) measure of ESE, which asks
respondents to rate their certainty that they can perform various roles and tasks associated
with entrepreneurial management. Respondents’ ratings of their ESE were recorded using 15
five-point Likert-type items. Following the example of Chen et al. (1998), a Total ESE score
was calculated for each respondent by averaging all of the items in the scale. The entire scale
had a Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of .85.
7.3.2. Organizational determinants
Firm age was calculated as the number of months since the firm became a full-time
occupation for at least one person. Firm size was measured as the number of full-time
employees. Decision comprehensiveness was measured using a technique for measuring
decision processes developed by Judge and Miller (1991). The technique involves asking
respondents to identify and briefly describe the most important strategic decision made by

<-----Page 10----->D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

633

their firms within the last two years. The respondents then answer a series of questions about
the process by which the firm made the decision. These questions included the
comprehensiveness scale, a five-item, seven-point Likert-type scale developed by Dean
and Sharfman (1993) that inquired into the degree to which the firm was comprehensive in its
scanning, analysis and planning activities in approaching the identified strategic decision. A
principal components analysis with a bvarimaxQ rotation indicated that the items again loaded
onto a single factor with a Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of .77. External equity
investor was a dummy variable set to b1Q for managers who reported that their firms had
obtained equity financing from external sources. An external investor was defined in the
survey as a venture capital fund, an angel investor, or another individual who was not a
founder, manager or employee of the firm. These data were supplemented and confirmed with
archival data whenever possible.
7.3.3. Control variables
Past research has shown that education can make people more aware of judgmental
heuristics and biases and less likely to commit them (Lichtenstein and Fischoff, 1977). In
addition, research has suggested a possible link between gender and overconfidence (Barber
and Odean, 2001). For these reasons, the analyses controlled for the possible effects of
individuals’ education levels and gender. The education level of the respondents was coded
using a five-point scale based on the amount of education they reported having completed.
Gender was set to b0Q for males and b1Q for females and was determined based on the
individuals’ first names. Finally, prior entrepreneurial experience was measured by asking
respondents to report the number of times that they had previously been involved in founding
or managing a new venture. This measure was also used as a control variable because serial
entrepreneurship demonstrates not only a willingness to exploit a specific opportunity but an
attraction to the process of entrepreneurship itself, and this attraction may reflect an
underlying cognitive profile (Wright et al., 1997a).

8. Analyses and results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the variables and the correlations among them.
Table 2 presents the results of hierarchical regression analyses used to test the hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1, which predicted that new-venture managers who were founders would be
more overconfident than would be those who were not founders, was tested using the full
sample of respondents, which included both founder and nonfounder managers of new
ventures. Hypothesis 2 through Hypothesis 7 were tested using a restricted sample that
included only founder-managers. Models 1, 2 and 3 of Table 2 show the results of the
analyses used to test Hypothesis 2 through Hypothesis 7. In these analyses, the control
variables were entered in Model 1, followed by the individual and organizational variables in
Models 2 and 3, respectively. Models 4 and 5 of Table 2 show the results of the analyses used
to test Hypothesis 1. Model 4 includes all of the independent variables used in this study,
except founder status, which is added in Model 5. The dependent variable for all of the

regression models was the respondents’ overconfidence score, a continuous variable
representing their respective scores on the overconfidence test described earlier.
The positive, significant coefficient associated with founder status in Model 5
indicates support for Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 1 was further supported by a separate
analysis not shown in the table. An analysis of variance ( F=10.45; pb.01) showed that the
mean overconfidence level of founders (21.45) is significantly higher than that of
nonfounders (3.00). Levene’s test did not provide evidence of unequal variances between
the samples.
Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3 proposed some individual-level determinants of
overconfidence. Hypothesis 2 proposed that younger entrepreneurs would be more
overconfident than older ones would be. The fact that the managerial age coefficient in
Model 3 of Table 2 is significant and negative supports this hypothesis. Hypothesis 3
proposed that entrepreneurs with higher levels of ESE would be more overconfident than
would be those with lower levels. The fact that the ESE coefficient is not significant indicates
that this hypothesis was not supported.
Hypothesis 4 through Hypothesis 7 proposed organization-level determinants of overconfidence. Hypothesis 4 and Hypothesis 5 proposed that entrepreneurs in smaller and
younger ventures would be more overconfident than would be those in larger and older
ventures. Table 1 shows that, as these hypotheses would predict, both firm age and size are
negatively correlated with overconfidence; however, the correlations are only modestly
significant ( pb.10). Moreover, Model 3 shows that, contrary to Hypothesis 4 and Hypothesis
5, neither firm size nor firm age was significantly related to overconfidence in the multivariate
analysis.
Hypothesis 6 proposed that firm decision comprehensiveness would be positively related
to overconfidence. In fact, the comprehensiveness coefficient shown in Model 3 of Table 2 is
significant and positive, indicating the presence of a strong reverse relationship:
Entrepreneurs exhibit more overconfidence when their firms are more comprehensive, not
less. Hypothesis 7 proposed that the presence of external investors would be negatively
related to overconfidence. The external investors coefficient in Model 3 is significant and
negative, providing support for Hypothesis 7.
A comparison of Models 3 and 5 of Table 2 shows that the independent variables used in
Hypothesis 2 through Hypothesis 7 have similar effects on overconfidence when nonfounders
are added to the sample.
8.1. Implications of the findings
Overall, these results provide evidence of significant differences among entrepreneurs
regarding the degree to which they exhibit an important cognitive bias that has been shown to
be characteristic of entrepreneurs. This general finding underscores that entrepreneurs are not
cognitively homogeneous and should encourage researchers to consider the strategic
implications of cognitive differences among entrepreneurs. In addition, this article’s
identification of specific individual and organizational determinants of entrepreneurial
overconfidence implies that educators and practitioners may be able to undertake

<-----Page 14----->D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

637

interventions designed to help entrepreneurs to think and make decisions better in their
capacity as new-venture managers.
The findings of this study also have several implications for our understanding of why
entrepreneurs think differently from nonentrepreneurs. The findings that organizational
decision practices and organizational ownership influence the degree to which entrepreneurs
are overconfident support Baron’s (1998) contentions that the phenomenon of entrepreneurial
cognition is not entirely a function of individual differences filtered through a self-selection
process and that entrepreneurial cognition is, at least partly, induced by the context within
which entrepreneurs function. At the same time, however, the finding that founder-managers
exhibit more overconfidence than do new-venture managers who did not found their firms
implies that new-venture managers’ cognition is not entirely a function of their present work
context and that, as Busenitz and Barney (1997) argue, at least some of entrepreneurial
cognition can be explained with reference to the cognitive profile that individuals bbring with
themQ to the task of new-venture creation. The finding that younger managers are more
overconfident than are older ones reinforces this point but, at the same time, suggests that
individuals’ cognitive profiles change over time in ways that may affect the presence of
entrepreneurial cognition.
Several unexpected results require explanation. The lack of association between age or size
and overconfidence, for example, suggests that the rate of change in the degree to which
entrepreneurs exhibit entrepreneurial cognition may be relatively slow. However, it should be
recalled that the firms in this sample were relatively young and small: Two-thirds were less
than 4 years old, and four-fifths had 10 or fewer employees. The effects of size and age on
cognition may be more robust in ventures that are larger and older than these.
The positive association between decision comprehensiveness and overconfidence is
another unexpected finding. One possible explanation can be derived from past research
showing that individuals gain confidence in judgment and decision situations by considering
more information but that more information does not significantly improve—and may even
diminish—decision accuracy (Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998). Consistent with this, Zacharakis
and Shepherd (2001) showed that venture capitalists with access to more information were
actually more overconfident. Thus, it may be that entrepreneurs whose firms engage in more
comprehensive decision processes experience this unwarranted increase in confidence as a
result of possessing more information.
Finally, it is interesting to reflect on the lack of a relationship between ESE and
overconfidence. This result underscores that these constructs, which are sometimes conflated
in theoretical discussions of entrepreneurship, are conceptually and empirically distinct. It
further suggests that the overconfidence bias does not flow cleanly from a general tendency
towards inflated self-appraisal and instead has more subtle psychological sources that require
further empirical investigation.
8.2. Limitations of this study
This study has some limitations that should be borne in mind in interpreting the findings.
The data in this study were drawn from a single research context that was bounded by

<-----Page 15----->638

D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

industry considerations, as well as geography. Accordingly, care should be taken in
generalizing these results to entrepreneurs in other settings. In addition, the cross-sectional
design of this study does not permit an examination of the temporal stability of the
overconfidence bias. Understanding how quickly entrepreneurs’ susceptibility to this bias
changes over time will be necessary to develop a fuller understanding of the sources of
entrepreneurial cognition.
8.3. Directions for future research
Future research should consider the causes and consequences of other aspects of
entrepreneurial cognition besides overconfidence. In particular, researchers should consider
the possibility that determinants of entrepreneurial cognition might reside at the environmental level of analysis, as well as at the individual or organizational levels. For example,
environmental dynamism may be a source of the uncertainty and novelty to which Baron
(1998) attributes entrepreneurial cognition. If this were true, then one might expect to see
higher levels of susceptibility to certain cognitive biases, not just among entrepreneurs but
among other kinds of managers who operate in more dynamic environments.
In addition, future research should employ repeated measures of entrepreneurial cognition
in an effort to determine how entrepreneurial cognition changes over time. Longitudinal
research in this area could help to answer some interesting new questions. For example, do
the cognitive processes of founders and of nonfounder managers of new ventures converge
over time as the former adapt to the responsibilities of management and the latter adapt to the
challenges specific to new ventures? Alternatively, longitudinal research could help to clarify
what drives the self-selection processes that contribute to differences in overconfidence. For
example, do some founders choose to discontinue their roles as new-venture managers
because they possess a cognitive profile that leaves them averse to the situational pressures
associated with managing more fully developed ventures? Or do founders’ decisions about
whether to stay on as new-venture managers stem from affective sources instead, such as a
sense of commitment to the venture? Relatedly, longitudinal studies of capital-seeking
entrepreneurs could help to clarify whether overconfidence serves to inhibit external
investment or whether the presence of such investment is responsible for changing how
entrepreneurs think in this regard.
Finally, future research should seek to determine the performance implications of
overconfidence and the other biases and heuristics associated with entrepreneurial cognition.
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) observed that bIn general, . . . [decision] heuristics are quite
useful, but sometimes they lead to severe and systematic errorsQ (p. 1124). Much research
on decision making in organizations has emphasized the latter half of this statement; that is,
the potential for cognitive shortcuts to lead to negative decision outcomes (e.g., Bazerman,
1994; Russo and Schoemaker, 1992). However, it should not be forgotten that these
shortcuts also provide a useful means of coping with the pressures imposed by large
quantities of information and tight time constraints. Moreover, seemingly irrational or
foolish decision processes can generate many positive outcomes for individuals and
organizations (March, 1988). In the end, overconfidence and similar heuristics probably

<-----Page 16----->D.P. Forbes / Journal of Business Venturing 20 (2005) 623–640

639

cannot be summarily declared to be either beneficial or detrimental to the management of
new ventures. Rather, as Alvarez and Busenitz (2001) note, the cognitive processes of
entrepreneurs bare likely to have strengths and weaknesses in various competitive
environmentsQ (p. 757). Thus, the effects of these processes may vary depending on the
type of venture involved, the stage of the venture, environmental conditions and other
contextual factors. Determining which factors are the most important moderators of such
effects is an important task of future research.
