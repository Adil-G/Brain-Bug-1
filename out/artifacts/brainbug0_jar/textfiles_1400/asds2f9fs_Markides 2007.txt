demic research for guidance1 but also that academic researchers themselves rarely turn to managers for developing their research questions or
research agenda (e.g., Abrahamson, 1996; Mowday,
1997). In fact, as Oviatt and Miller (1989) pointed
out, cooperation between academics and managers
is so rare that when it happens, it makes national
newspaper headlines.2
As a result of such uneasiness, several remedies—some more radical than others— have been
proposed to close the perceived gap. For example,
Rynes, Bartunek, and Daft (2001) built upon the
work of Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) to argue that
all four forms of knowledge creation (that is, socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) should be actively pursued through tactics
such as joint symposia between academics and
practitioners, consulting relationships, sabbaticals
in industry, action research, joint academic-practitioner research teams, and training with distributed
practice. Similarly, a recent report by a task force of
the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of
Business International (AACSB, 2007) proposed
seven action steps (such as developing an awards
program to recognize high-impact faculty research
and strengthening interactions between faculty and
managers) as ways forward. Vermeulen (2005) suggested that the best way to bridge the gap is to ask
research questions that are important to managers
but to pursue the answer in an academically rigorous way. But he also lamented the fact that this will
not happen unless the underlying incentives and
culture of the academic system are first changed to
encourage this type of research. Other ideas and
proposals have come from a variety of academics
and practitioners (e.g., Aldag, 1997; Garland, 1999;

A social system left to itself gravitates toward equilibrium—maximum entropy so to speak. The position of maximum entropy for a professional school
is the one in which the faculty trained in the profession is absorbed in the culture of the profession,
whereas the faculty trained in an underlying discipline is absorbed in the culture of that discipline,
leaving a deep gulf between them. . . . [This is] an
equilibrium that means mediocrity for the professional school and inability to fulfill its special functions. All efforts to avoid this state of death must
aim at lowering the barriers that impede communication between the discipline-oriented and the profession-oriented wings of the faculty.
-Herbert Simon, 1967

There is a growing concern within the Academy
that a not insignificant gap exists between management research and practice. For example, in a recent survey of AOM members, Shapiro, Kirkman,
and Courtney (2007) reported the existence and
operation of not one but two types of gaps—the
“lost in translation” gap (when managerially relevant research fails to reach practitioners) and the
“lost before translation” gap (when managerially
relevant research is not undertaken by academics).
Similarly, in an article that generated quite a bit of
controversy, Bennis and O’Toole (2005) claimed
that business schools have lost their way in the last
30 years primarily because they have focused too
much on doing “scientific” research and ended up
hiring professors with limited real-world experience who produce research and teaching that is not
relevant to managers. Other studies have shown not
only that practicing managers do not turn to aca-

Stanford, declared: “In the past I had not been a satisfied
customer and now I could hardly be considered a customer” (Price, 1995: 102).

al., 2007).
Although I fully subscribe to the goal of making
management research (more) managerially relevant, I have two concerns with the way the debate
on how to achieve this goal has evolved in the
AOM. First, management scholars have jumped
into recommendations without first defining
clearly what exactly managerially relevant research
is or how serious the gap between research and
practice really is. And second, I am worried that
some of the remedies proposed are worse than the
disease. If we don’t stem their growth, they will
lead business schools to what Herbert Simon (1997)
called “a state of death.” In what follows, I first
comment on two of the remedies proposed and
then argue that the problem can be resolved in a
satisfactory way only if we take a more holistic
view of what managerially relevant research
really is.
REASONS FOR THE PERSISTENCE
OF THE GAP
The perceived persistence of the gap between
research and managerial practice is truly remarkable, if not mysterious! The ideas and advice that
have been proposed over the past 30 years to close
it are numerous, sensible, practical, and not particularly resource-expensive. The people arguing for
such change are senior figures in the Academy who
do not lack credibility. The willingness and desire
to make the Academy more relevant is real and well
intentioned. Yet, the gap persists— or so it seems.
What can explain such an outcome?
Blame the System
Several culprits have been identified in the literature. The first and most obvious one is that the
underlying incentives as well as the cultures and
values of the academic system do not encourage
managerially relevant research (e.g., Vermeulen,
2005). For example, Bennis and O’Toole claimed
this: “The dirty little secret at most of today’s best
business schools is that they chiefly serve the faculty’s research interests and career goals, with too
little regard for the needs of other stakeholders”
(2005: 103). This explanation also featured prominently in the responses given in the survey of AOM
members undertaken by Shapiro et al. (2007). It is a
sensible point that builds upon the work of Senge,
who argued that the underlying structure of a system creates the behaviors we see in that system
(1990). If one defines the “underlying structure” to
include an organization’s cultures, structures, val-

763

ues, and incentives, then the implication is clear:
the underlying structure of the academic system
does not encourage managerially relevant research,
and only a systemic change can bring about the
desired results.
Although the argument is well taken, it still does
not help one understand why we in the field of
management keep such a system in place. If it really produces research that lacks relevance, why
don’t we simply change it? Even worse, if, as many
believe, the gap between theory and practice is
getting bigger and bigger, then our system is getting
worse and worse. What explains our inability to
change such a sick system— especially in the face
of increasing pressure from our capital providers
(such as the National Science Foundation) to do so?
Other than arrogance and complacency, could
there be a perfectly good reason why we refuse to
change our underlying cultures and incentives?
Could it be that we need the current system and
fear that any attempts to alter it will backfire on us?
Oviatt and Miller (1989) articulated a possible
explanation for such inaction. Their basic argument is that the lack of pressure to change a system
that serves only academics well (rather than our
“customers”) can be traced back to the economics
of the business education industry. Because of a
growing market that creates excess demand for
business school professors as well as an industry
structure (i.e., the five forces of the academic industry) that gives academics the bargaining power,
most academics will remain intransigent in the face
of calls for more managerially relevant research.
Only a drop in the demand for business professors
could lead to changes in the system.
My own position is that part of our inaction on
this front stems from fear—the fear that in our
attempt to alter our current system, we might destroy the very thing that made us (i.e., the senior
faculty) so successful. Framed in Porter’s (1980)
language, the fear is that by attempting to develop
incentives and systems that encourage both academic and managerially relevant research, we may
get ourselves “stuck in the middle.” As I explain
below, this is a legitimate concern only if we attempt to change the system in a radical way. I
believe that doing so would be a mistake: the system does not need radical change—minor “adjustments” are all that are needed. I will propose a few
such adjustments to the system at the end of my
essay.
What I am advocating is for us to be careful not to
throw the baby out with the bath water. This is the
same message that Bill Gates delivered at his Harvard commencement speech in June 2007, when he
declared that we need to rewrite the rules of the

<-----Page 2----->764

Academy of Management Journal

capitalist system to solve inequity in the world. He
asked for not a total overhaul of the system but
some reengineering of what exists today. He called
that “creative capitalism.” As reported by Grossman (2007: 42), Gates said, “Capitalism has really
triumphed in this incredible way and certainly for
at least a billion people, it’s done a spectacular job
and alternative systems have not. Yet there’s this
strong feeling that getting that system to direct itself
to the right problem—there’s more that can be
done.” He then asked for adjustments to the system
so as to get it directed in the right way. The academic system in the field of management needs
similar adjustments, not major surgery.
It’s Difficult to Do Both
Yet another reason given for the perceived persistence of the gap rests on the rather obvious point
that it is hard to be both rigorous and relevant
(Staw, 1995). This dilemma surfaces because the
set of skills, values, mind-sets, and attitudes that
are needed to conduct rigorous academic research
are fundamentally different from the set of skills,
values, and attitudes needed to conduct managerial
research.
For example, academics value a carefully crafted
argument that builds upon the existing literature, is
supported empirically through careful data collection and rigorous analysis, and adds incrementally
to the body of knowledge. Managerially relevant
research, on the other hand, tends to emphasize a
“big idea” and is not particularly concerned with
rigorous analysis or the conventional requirements
of normal, positivist science. Similarly, academic
researchers tend to see other academics as their
reference group—they aim to communicate (primarily) with fellow academics and derive their
senses of worth and identity from this reference
group. Researchers engaged in managerially relevant research, on the other hand, see managers as
their audience and aim to develop insights that
help managers understand themselves and their
organizations better.
According to this argument, not only are the
types of skills and mind-sets needed for academic
research different from the skills needed for managerially relevant research; the two skill sets also
conflict. Porter (1996) talked about the problem of
trade-offs and conflicts in strategy. In his language,
what the argument here says is that the activities
required to be an academic researcher are incompatible with the activities required to compete in
the managerially relevant market because of various trade-offs that exist between the two ways of
doing research. By trying to do both, an academic

August

researcher runs the risk of degrading the value of
his or her existing research and may end up paying
a huge straddling cost (Porter, 1996).
Porter (1996) identified three main reasons that
give rise to trade-offs in strategy. Applying them to
academia, one first has trade-offs that arise from
inconsistencies in an academic’s image or reputation. A researcher who tries to simultaneously offer
two different, inconsistent kinds of value runs the
risk of damaging her or his existing image and
reputation. Second, trade-offs occur because the
values and aspirations of an academic researcher
are incompatible with the values and aspirations of
a managerial researcher. Finally, trade-offs arise
owing to the limits a person faces in single-handedly trying to coordinate and control incompatible
sets of activities.
A DANGEROUS REMEDY
According to the above argument, business
schools keep hiring freshly minted Ph.D.’s who are
trained and socialized to do rigorous academic research. Since they do not possess the skills and
mind-sets needed for managerially relevant research, nor are they able to adopt such conflicting
mind-sets, it is no wonder that the gap between
theory and practice keeps growing.
This formulation had led some people to propose
that a solution to this problem was to recognize that
the challenge of doing both good academic research
and good managerially relevant research is too formidable for academic researchers. They should,
therefore, focus their energy on what they do best
and “subcontract” the production and dissemination of managerially relevant research to “others”
who are better suited for this task. These others
could be specially hired professors of management
practice who are entrusted with producing managerially relevant research and rewarded for its production; or they could be schools focused exclusively on managerial relevance (like IMD in
Switzerland or Ashridge in the United Kingdom);
or they could be consulting firms, a few of which—
such as Monitor— have already started moving into
the business education market.
Proponents of this “solution” find support for it
in the literature on amdidexterity, where structural
separation with limited integrative mechanisms is
offered as the way to do two contradictory things at
the same time. This idea is also made more palatable by the realization that this business model
exists and is widely accepted in what Caves (2002)
called the “creative industries”—movies, theatre,
art galleries, book publishing, and music publishing. Caves (2002) reported that in such creative

<-----Page 3----->2007

Markides

industries, one type of firm (usually small-scale
“pickers”) concentrates on the selection and development of new creative talents, while another type
of firm (usually large-scale “promoters”) undertakes the packaging and distribution of the products. Similarly, Birkinshaw (2007) found that the
people who deliver commercial outcomes tend to
be rather different from those who are accustomed
to producing academic outcomes.
Elegant as this argument might seem, it could
lead business schools down a slippery road if
adopted in academia. First, allowing academics to
get on with their careers without worrying about
the relevance of their work (or without interacting
with managers) is like isolating the R&D department of a company from the customer and the
market: the end result will be products that nobody
wants. That is exactly the kind of result that Simon
(1967) warned about. Second, if these professors of
management practice are not academics themselves, the inevitable result would be the creation
of second-class citizens within business schools,
which would be bad for “them” and bad for “our”
culture. And third, if these professors of management practice had not been trained in carrying out
rigorous academic research (as many retired CEOs
who become such professors are not), the field of
management could very well end up with findings
that are simply wrong (Rosenzweig, 2007). How
many popular beliefs or ideas have gained managerial attention in the last 20 years, only to be debunked as half-truths or even total errors (Pfeffer &
Sutton, 2006)? Relevant they may be, but that
doesn’t make them correct. How could we academics expect people who have not been trained in the
art and science of rigorous academic research to
produce rigorous research findings? Such a strategy
could spell disaster for us and for our schools.
WHERE IS THE GAP?
Before embarking on radical surgery, such as
changing the academic incentive system or subcontracting managerially relevant research to specialists— both of which are, in my opinion, remedies
that are worse than the disease—it may be worthwhile to step back and take a fresh look at the
problem.
The aspiration is to produce and disseminate
managerially relevant research. The question is,
What exactly is managerially relevant research? Let
us take a noncontroversial definition as our basis: it
is research that develops insights that help managers understand themselves and their organizations
better. This research may be disseminated to managers either through publications or through other

765

means, such as classroom teaching, speeches, consulting, and so on. Now, let us consider another
simple question: How many of you reading this
essay have actually used your research findings in
your classroom teaching?
I have not done a scientific survey on this question, but I would find it surprising if most of us did
not answer this question in the affirmative. Certainly in my own small network of AOM colleagues, I cannot think of a single person who has
not communicated her or his research findings to
students. I do not mean that all of these colleagues’
teaching is about their research findings, nor do I
mean that everything they have researched has
found its way into the classroom. Rather, they utilize their research findings whenever they teach
things related to what they are researching. Let me,
therefore, propose the following: if you have communicated some of your research findings to your
students, then by definition you are doing managerially relevant research.
If that is the case, why do we still feel that there
is a big gap between theory and practice? I believe
that one reason lies in an overly narrow definition
of managerial relevance. Scholars have somehow
come to believe that this is only research that gets
published in journals like the Harvard Business
Review (HBR) or the Sloan Management Review
(SMR) or in books. Yet we all know that these are
only a small subset of the available outlets for the
dissemination of our research. Plus we all know
that young academics, who are under severe time
pressure to produce enough academic publications
to gain tenure, cannot afford the time commitment
needed to publish their work in HBR or as a book.
Yet the same academics who couldn’t care less
about publishing in HBR continue to do managerially relevant research and continue to disseminate
their research findings through their teaching.
Another reason why we researchers perceive a
gap is because we associate it with other concerns,
some legitimate, some not, about the academic system. For example, several academic studies bemoaning the existence of a gap have reported that
managers complain that they cannot even read our
journals—a clear indication, according to them,
that we fail to produce relevant research. But who
says that the academic journals are the appropriate
vehicle for communicating research results to managers? Whatever happened to classroom teaching or
executive education or conference speeches? Similarly, academics and practitioners complain that
many of us develop our research questions without
talking to managers. But since when has such discussion become the only way for academics to develop research questions that are relevant to man-

<-----Page 4----->766

Academy of Management Journal

agers? Do authors of murder novels first talk to
murderers before writing their novels? Can we not
develop relevant research questions simply by
reading the business press or by talking to our
executive students?
A final reason for the perceived gap is the (mistaken) belief that managerially relevant research is
all about developing great ideas that somehow redirect managerial thinking or attract wide attention
and popular acclaim—In Search of Excellence and
Good to Great come readily to mind. Although
great ideas are always welcome, the truth of the
matter is that most good managerial research is not
of this kind. Rather, one should aim to ask managerially interesting questions, shed some light on
them, and help progress the thinking on these issues in an incremental way. Successfully debunking popular myths in a rigorous way or helping
people think about an issue in a better way are the
hallmarks of good, managerially relevant research.
IMPLICATIONS
I do not believe that dismantling scholarly incentive systems in the hope of generating more or
better managerially relevant research is necessary
(or feasible). Nor do I believe that creating a twotier system, with academics on one end producing
academic research and adjuncts or professors of
management practice on the other end producing
managerially relevant research, will serve the field
well. There’s no need for such radical surgery!
Rather, let me propose four simple ideas.
First, we need to recognize that young academics
can be engaged in managerially relevant research
without publishing this research in HBR or the
Academy of Management Perspectives or other
managerial journals. Rather than bemoan the fact,
we should encourage young academics to avoid the
time-consuming exercise of trying to publish their
research in managerial journals and strive instead
to bring their research findings into their classroom
teaching. Books and management-oriented publications could be the preferred dissemination outlets
after tenure. Before tenure, classroom teaching
should be the preferred dissemination outlet. If we
truly believe this, perhaps we could develop incentives that reward people who utilize their research
findings in their teaching. Or maybe business
schools should “forbid” faculty from developing
and teaching elective courses unless they bring
their own research findings into their elective
teaching.
Second, we need to appreciate that there are different types of managerially relevant research.
Translating our (academic) research into manage-

August

rial lessons is one type; successfully debunking
popular myths or discrediting “conventional wisdom” is another type; developing new theoretical
rationales for current business phenomena is yet
another. Not everybody can do everything, so different researchers should choose the type that
serves them best. One type of managerially relevant
research is the one intended to develop grand new
theories without the necessary empirical evidence
to support them. The idea is to develop these theories and then have future researchers empirically
test them for accuracy and validity (think of Darwin’s theory of evolution). This type of research
requires a writer to take creative leaps and offer
ideas and insights not immediately supported by
available data. This is risky business, and we
should encourage young colleagues to avoid this
type of research. It is better suited to academics
who can afford to take such risks—perhaps academics who have already received tenure in the
system.
Third, many fellow academics have already provided a lot of useful advice on how to make our
research more relevant; this advice includes asking
managerially interesting questions and pursuing
them in a rigorous way, and testing our research
questions and ideas on managers. Aldag (1997),
Bennis and O’Toole (2005), Garland (1999), Hambrick (1994), Oviatt and Miller (1989), Rynes, Bartunek, and Daft (2001), Shapiro, Kirkman, and
Courtney (2007), and Vermeulen (2005) have all
offered advice along these lines. Academics who
want to become better at this kind of work should
take this advice on board. But at the same time, we
need to remember that we are now advising companies to pursue “open innovation”—that is, to
search for ideas outside their firm boundaries. Perhaps we can take some of our own medicine?
At the organizational level, what “open innovation” implies for business schools is the need to
go beyond one’s school boundaries for help. Either through allying with external bodies (such as
consulting firms) or by working closely with corporate universities, a business school can bring
its academic faculty closer to the managerial
world. At the individual level, open innovation
implies that researchers need to begin working on
research projects with nonacademics, such as
consultants and managers, or with academics
from other disciplines.
Finally, we need to appreciate that the challenge
of doing good, managerially relevant research is
very difficult. It requires ambidextrous mind-sets
and attitudes. Therefore, we should look for insights on what to do in the existing literature on
ambidexterity. According to Tushman and

<-----Page 5----->2007

Markides

O’Reilly (2004), an organization can become ambidextrous by creating a unit separate from itself,
the parent, with each focusing on what it does
best. High differentiation is allowed to exist between the two, but they are also kept together
through a common vision and targeted but limited integrative mechanisms.
What this implies for academic researchers who
aspire and want to do managerially relevant research is temporal separation in the type of managerially relevant research they pursue and in the
outlets they use to disseminate their work. Before
tenure, academic researchers ought to focus primarily on doing research designed to translate their
research findings into managerial insights and then
disseminating it primarily through their teaching.
After tenure, they could move into the “riskier”
type of managerial research that I discussed above,
and they should aim to publish it in books. The
integrative mechanisms that they utilize would be
the knowledge and research skills that they have
accumulated as academic researchers. For this
strategy to work, many business schoools may need
to change how tenured faculty are evaluated and
rewarded, but this should not be as difficult a task
as changing the whole system.
Perhaps none of my proposed ideas are new, and
certainly they are not radical. But they could make
a big difference. And that would be the best outcome to aim for: a major change achieved not by
revolution, but by evolution.
