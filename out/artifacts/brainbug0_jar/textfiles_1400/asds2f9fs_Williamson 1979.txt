GOVERNANCEOF CONTRACTUAL

OLIVER E. WILLIAMSON
University of Pennsylvania

T HE new institutional economics is preoccupied with the origins, incidence, and ramifications of transaction costs. Indeed, if transaction costs are
negligible, the organization of economic activity is irrelevant, since any
advantages one mode of organization appears to hold over another will
simply be eliminated by costless contracting. But despite the growing realization that transaction costs are central to the study of economics,1 skeptics
remain. Stanley Fischer's complaint is typical: "Transaction costs have a
well-deserved bad name as a theoretical device . . . [partly] because there is a
suspicion that almost anything can be rationalized by invoking suitably
specified transaction costs."2 Put differently, there are too many degrees of
freedom; the concept wants for definition.

Among the factors on which there appears to be developing a general
consensus are: (1) opportunism is a central concept in the study of transaction costs;3 (2) opportunism is especially important for economic activity that
involves transaction-specific investments in human and physical capital;4 (3)
the efficient processing of information is an important and related concept;S
and (4) the assessment of transaction costs is a comparative institutional
undertaking.6 Beyond these general propositions, a consensus on transaction
costs is lacking.
Further progress in the study of transaction costs awaits the identification
of the critical dimensions with respect to which transaction costs differ and
an examination of the economizing properties of alternative institutional
modes for organizing transactions. Only then can the matching of transactions with modes be accomplished with confidence. This paper affirms the
proposition that transaction costs are central to the study of economics,
identifies the critical dimensions for characterizing transactions, describes
the main governance structures of transactions, and indicates how and why
transactions can be matched with institutions in a discriminating way.
I am mainly concerned with intermediate-product market transactions.
Whereas previously I have emphasized the incentives to remove transactions
from the market and organize them internally (vertical integration),7 the
analysis here is symmetrical and deals with market, hierarchical, and intermediate modes of organization alike. The question of why there is so much
vertical integration remains interesting, but no more so than the question of
why there are so many market- (and quasi-market) mediated transactions. A
discriminating analysis will explain which transactions are located where
and give the reasons why. The overall object of the exercise essentially
comes down to this: for each abstract description of a transaction, identify

the most economical governance structure--where by governance structure I
refer to the institutional framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided. Markets and hierarchies are two of the main alternatives.
Some legal background to the study of transactions is briefly reviewed in
Section I. Of the three dimensions for describing transactions that I propose,
investment attributes are the least well understood and probably the most
important. The special relevance of investments is developed in the context
of the economics of idiosyncrasy in Section II. A general contracting schema
is developed and applied to commercial contracting in Section III. Applications to labor, regulation, family transactions, and capital markets are
sketched in Section IV. Major implications are summarized in Section V.
Concluding remarks follow.

SOME CONTRACTINGBACKGROUND

Although there is widespread agreement that the discrete-transaction
paradigm-"sharp in by clear agreement; sharp out by clear performance"8-has served both law and economics well, there is increasing
awareness that many contractual relations are not of this well-defined kind.9
A deeper understanding of the nature of contract has emerged as the legalrule emphasis associated with the study of discrete contracting has given
way to a more general concern with the contractual purposes to be served.10

10The technical versus purposive distinction is made by Clyde Summers, supra note 9. He
distinguishes between "black letter law," on the one hand (539, 543, 548, 566) and a more
circumstantial approach to law, on the other (549-51, 561, 566). "The epitome of abstraction is
the Restatement, which illustrates its black letter rules by transactions suspended in mid-air,
creating the illusion that contract rules can be stated without reference to surrounding circumstances and are therefore generally applicable to all contractual transactions" (566). He observes
that such a conception does not and cannot provide a "framework for integrating rules and
principles applicable to all contractual transactions"(566) but that this must be sought in a more

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

Ian Macneil, in a series of thoughtful and
wide-ranging essays on contract,
usefully distinguishes between discrete and relational transactions. 11 He
further supplies twelve different "concepts" with
respect to which these differ.12
Serious problems of recognition and application are
posed by such a rich
classificatory apparatus. More useful for my purposes is the three-way
classification of contracts that
Macneil offers in his most recent article,
where classical, neoclassical, and relational categories of
contract law are
recognized.
A. Classical Contract Law
As Macneil observes, any system of contract law has
the purpose of
facilitating exchange. What is distinctive about classical contract law is that
it attempts to do this by enhancing discreteness and
intensifying "presentiation,"13 where presentiation has reference to efforts to "make or render
present in place or time; to cause to be perceived or realized at
present."14
The economic counterpart to complete presentiation is
contingent-claims
contracting-which entails comprehensive contracting whereby all relevant
future contingencies pertaining to the supply of a
good or service are described and discounted with respect to both likelihood and
futurity.15
Classical contract law endeavors to implement discreteness and
presentiationin several ways. For one thing, the
identity of the parties to a transaction is treated as irrelevant. In this respect it
corresponds exactly with the
"ideal"market transaction in economics.16 Second, the nature of the agreement is carefully delimited, and the more formal features
govern when
formal (for example, written) and informal (for
example, oral) terms are
contested. Third, remedies are narrowly prescribed
such that, "should the
initialpresentiation fail to materialize because of
nonperformance, the consequences are relatively predictable from the beginning and are not

As Lester G. Telser & Harlow N. Higinbotham

for any other unit. The identities of the parties in any
do
not affect the terms of exchange. The organized market mutually agreeable transaction

ended."17 Additionally, third-party participation is discouraged.18 The emphasis, thus, is on legal rules, formal documents, and self-liquidating transactions.
B. Neoclassical Contract Law
Not every transaction fits comfortably into the classical-contracting
scheme. In particular, long-term contracts executed under conditions of uncertainty are ones for which complete presentiation is apt to be prohibitively
costly if not impossible. Problems of several kinds arise. First, not all future
contingencies for which adaptations are required can be anticipated at the
outset. Second, the appropriate adaptations will not be evident for many
contingencies until the circumstances materialize. Third, except as changes
in states of the world are unambiguous, hard contracting between autonomous parties may well give rise to veridical disputes when state-contingent
claims are made. In a world where (at least some) parties are inclined to be
opportunistic, whose representations are to be believed?
Faced with the prospective breakdown of classical contracting in these
circumstances, three alternatives are available. One would be to forgo such
transactions altogether. A second would be to remove these transactions
from the market and organize them internally instead. Adaptive, sequential
decision making would then be implemented under common ownership and
with the assistance of hierarchical incentive and control systems. Third, a
different contracting relation which preserves trading but provides for additional governance structure might be devised. This last brings us to what
Macneil refers to as neoclassical contracting.
As Macneil observes, "Two common characteristics of long-term contracts
are the existence of gaps in their planning and the presence of a range of
processes and techniques used by contract planners to create flexibility in
lieu of either leaving gaps or trying to plan rigidly."19Third-party assistance
in resolving disputes and evaluating performance often has advantages over
litigation in serving these functions of flexibility and gap filling. Lon Fuller's
remarks on procedural differences between arbitration and litigation are
instructive:
. . . there are open to the arbitrator . . . quick methods of education not open to the
courts. An arbitrator will frequently interrupt the examination of witnesses with a
request that the parties educate him to the point where he can understand the
testimony being received. This education can proceed informally, with frequent
interruptions by the arbitrator, and by informed persons on either side, when a point

needs clarification. Sometimes there will be arguments across the table, occasionally
even within each of the separate camps. The end result will usually be a clarification
that will enable everyone to proceed more intelligently with the case. There is in this
informal procedure no infringement whatever of arbitrational due process.20
A recognition that the world is complex, that agreements are incomplete,
and that some contracts will never be reached unless both parties have
confidence in the settlement machinery thus characterizes neoclassical contract law. One important purposive difference in arbitration and litigation
that contributes to the procedural differences described by Fuller is that,
whereas continuity (at least completion of the contract) is presumed under
the arbitration machinery, this presumption is much weaker when litigation
is employed.21
C. Relational Contracting
The pressures to sustain ongoing relations "have led to the spin-off of
many subject areas from the classical, and later the neoclassical, contract
law system, e.g., much of corporate law and collective bargaining."22 Thus,
progressively increasing the "duration and complexity" of contract has resulted in the displacement of even neoclassical adjustment processes by
adjustment processes of a more thoroughly transaction-specific, ongoingadministrative kind.23 The fiction of discreteness is fully displaced as the
relation takes on the properties of "a minisociety with a vast array of norms
beyond those centered on the exchange and its immediate processes."24 By
contrast with the neoclassical system, where the reference point for effecting
adaptations remains the original agreement, the reference point under a
truly relational approach is the "entire relation as it has developed . . .
[through] time. This may or may not include an 'original agreement'; and if
it does, may or may not result in great deference being given it."25
II.

THE ECONOMICSOF IDIOSYNCRASY

Macneil's three-way discussion of contracts discloses that contracts are a
good deal more varied and complex than is commonly realized.26 It further20Lon L. Fuller, supra note 9, at 11-12.

more suggests that governance structures--the institutional matrix within
which transactions are negotiated and executed-vary with the nature of the
transaction. But the critical dimensions of contract are not expressly identified, and the purposes of governance are not stated. Harmonizing interests
that would otherwise give way to antagonistic subgoal pursuits appears to be
an important governance function, but this is not explicit in his discussion.
That simple governance structures should be used in conjunction with
simple contractual relations and complex governance structures reserved for
complex relations seems generally sensible. Use of a complex structure to
govern a simple relation is apt to incur unneeded costs, and use of a simple
structure for a complex transaction invites strain. But what is simple and
complex in contractual respects? Specific attention to the defining attributes
of transactions is evidently needed.
As developed in Section III, the three critical dimensions for characterizing transactions are (1) uncertainty, (2) the frequency with which transactions recur, and (3) the degree to which durable transaction-specific investments are incurred. Of these three, uncertainty is widely conceded to be a
critical attribute;27 and that frequency matters is at least plausible.28 The
governance ramifications of neither, however, have been fully developednor can they be until joined with the third critical dimension: transactionspecific investments. Inasmuch as a considerable amount of the "action" in
the study of governance is attributable to investment differences, some explication is needed.
A. General
The crucial investment distinction is this: to what degree are transactionspecific (nonmarketable) expenses incurred. Items that are unspecialized
among users pose few hazards, since buyers in these circumstances can easily
turn to alternative sources, and suppliers can sell output intended for one
order to other buyers without difficulty.29 Nonmarketability problems arise
27For a recent study of contractual relations in which uncertainty is
featured, see Peter
Temin, Modes of Economic Behavior: Variations on Themes of J. R. Hicks and Herbert
Simon (March 1979) (Working Paper No. 235, MIT Dep't of Econ.).

Perspective Time: Goldberg's

Barzel's concern with standardization is mainly in connection with final-product markets,
whereas I am more interested in nonstandard investments. The two are not unrelated, but
identicalquality can often be realized with a variety of inputs. I am concerned with specialized

when the specific identity of the parties has important cost-bearing consequences. Transactions of this kind will be referred to as idiosyncratic.
Occasionally the identity of the parties is important from the outset, as
when a buyer induces a supplier to invest in specialized physical capital of a
transaction-specific kind. Inasmuch as the value of this capital in other uses
is, by definition, much smaller than the specialized use for which it has been
intended, the supplier is effectively "locked into" the transaction to a significant degree. This is symmetrical, moreover, in that the buyer cannot turn
to alternative sources of supply and obtain the item on favorable terms, since
the cost of supply from unspecialized capital is presumably great.30 The
buyer is thus committed to the transaction as well.
Ordinarily, however, there is more to idiosyncratic exchange than specialized physical capital. Human-capital investments that are transactionspecific commonly occur as well. Specialized training and learning-by-doing
economies in production operations are illustrations. Except when these
investments are transferable to alternative suppliers at low cost, which is
rare, the benefits of the set-up costs can be realized only so long as the
relationship between the buyer and seller of the intermediate product is
maintained.
Additional transaction-specific savings can accrue at the interface between
supplier and buyer as contracts are successively adapted to unfolding events,
and as periodic contract-renewal agreements are reached. Familiarity here
permits communication economies to be realized: specialized language develops as experience accumulates and nuances are signaled and received in a
sensitive way. Both institutional and personal trust relations evolve. Thus
the individuals who are responsible for adapting the interfaces have a personal as well as an organizational stake in what transpires. Where personal
integrity is believed to be operative, individuals located at the interfaces may
refuse to be a part of opportunistic efforts to take advantage of (rely on) the
letter of the contract when the spirit of the exchange is emasculated. Such
refusals can serve as a check upon organizational proclivities to behave
opportunistically.31 Other things being equal, idiosyncratic exchange rela30This assumes that it is costly for the incumbent supplier to transfer specialized physical
assets to new suppliers. On this, see Oliver E. Williamson, Franchise Bidding for Natural
Monopolies-in General and with Respect to CATV, 7 Bell J. Econ. 73 (1976). Klein, Crawford,& Alchian use the term "appropriablequasi rent" to refer to this condition. Use versus user
distinctionsare relevant in this connection: "The quasi-rent value of the asset is the excess of its
value over its salvage value, that is, its value in its next best use to another renter. The
potentiallyappropriable specialized portion of the quasi rent is the portion, if any, in excess of
itsvalue to the second highest-valuing user." Benjamin Klein, Robert G. Crawford, & Armen
A. Alchian, supra note 1,at 298.
31Thorstein Veblen's remarks on the distant relation of the head of alarge enterprise to
transactionsare apposite. He observes that under these impersonal circumstances "The mitigatingeffect which personal conduct may have in dealings between man and man is ... in great

<-----Page 9----->TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS

241

tions which feature personal trust will survive greater stress and display
greater adaptability.
Idiosyncratic goods and services are thus ones where investments of
transaction-specific human and physical capital are made and, contingent
upon successful execution, benefits are realized. Such investments can and
do occur in conjunction with occasional trades where delivery for a specialized design is stretched out over a long period (for example, certain construction contracts). The transactions that I wish to emphasize here, however, are
exchanges of the recurring kind. Although large-numbers competition is
frequently feasible at the initial award stage for recurring contracts of all
kinds, idiosyncratic transactions are ones for which the relationship between
buyer and supplier is quickly thereafter transformed into one of bilateral
monopoly-on account of the transaction-specific costs referred to above.
This transformation has profound contracting consequences.
Thus, whereas recurrent spot contracting is feasible for standardized
transactions (because large-numbers competition is continuously selfpolicing in these circumstances), such contracting has seriously defective
investment incentives where idiosyncratic activities are involved. By assumption, cost economies in production will be realized for idiosyncratic
activities only if the supplier invests in a special-purpose plant and equipment
or if his labor force develops transaction-specific skills in the course of contract execution (or both). The assurance of a continuing relation is needed to
encourage investments of both kinds. Although the requisite incentives
might be provided if long-term contracts were negotiated, such contracts are
necessarily incomplete (by reason of bounded rationality). Appropriate
state-contingent adaptations thus go unspecified. Intertemporal efficiency
nevertheless requires that adaptations to changing market circumstances be
made.
How to effect these adaptations poses a serious contracting dilemma,
though it bears repeating that, absent the hazards of opportunism, the
difficulties would vanish--since then the gaps in long-term, incomplete contracts could be faultlessly filled in an adaptive, sequential way. A general
clause, to which both parties would agree, to the effect that "I will behave
responsibly rather than seek individual advantage when an occasion to
adapt arises," would, in the absence of opportunism, suffice. Given, however, the unenforceability of general clauses and the proclivity of human
agents to make false and misleading (self-disbelieved) statements, the followmeasuredeliminated .... Business management [then] has a chance to proceed... untroubled by
sentimental considerations of human kindness or irritation or of honesty." The Theory of
Business Enterprise 53 (1927). Veblen evidently assigns slight weight to the possibility that
those to whom negotiating responsibilities are assigned will themselves invest the transactions
with integrity.

<-----Page 10----->242

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

ing hazard must be confronted: joined as they are in an idiosyncratic condition of bilateral monopoly, both buyer and seller are strategically situated to
bargain over the disposition of any incremental gain whenever a proposal to
adapt is made by the other party. Although both have a long-term interest in
effecting adaptations of a joint profit-maximizing kind, each also has an
interest in appropriating as much of the gain as he can on each occasion to
adapt. Efficient adaptations which would otherwise be made thus result in
costly haggling or even go unmentioned, lest the gains be dissipated by costly
subgoal pursuit. Governance structures which attenuate opportunism and
otherwise infuse confidence are evidently needed.
B. Examples
Some illustrations may help to motivate what is involved in idiosyncratic
transactions. Specialized physical capital is relatively straightforward. Examples are (1) the purchase of a specialized component from an outside
supplier or (2) the location of a specialized plant in a unique, proximate
relation to a downstream processing stage to which it supplies vital input.
Thus assume (a) that special-purpose equipment is needed to produce the
component in question (which is to say that the value of the equipment in its
next-best alternative use is much lower), (b) that scale economies require that
a significant, discrete investment be made, and (c) that alternative buyers for
such components are few (possibly because of the organization of the industry, possibly because of special-design features). The interests of buyer and
seller in a continuing exchange relation are plainly strong under these circumstances.
Plant-proximity benefits are attributable to transportation and related
flow-process(inventory, thermal economy, and so on) economies. A specializedplant need not be implied, but long life and a unique location are. Once
made, the investment preempts the unique location and is not thereafter
moveable (except at prohibitive cost). Buyer and supplier again need to
satisfy themselves that they have a workable, adaptable exchange agreement.32

Idiosyncratic investments in human capital are in many ways more interestingand less obvious than are those in physical capital. Polanyi's discussion of "personal knowledge" is illuminating:

was operating successfully in Germany, failing for a whole year to produce a single
flawless bulb.33
And he goes on to observe with respect to craftsmanship

that:

... an art which has fallen into disuse for the period of a generation is altogether lost.
. . . It is pathetic to watch the endless efforts-equipped with microscopy and
chemistry, with mathematics and electronics-to reproduce a single violin of the kind
the half-literate Stradivarius turned out as a matter of routine more than 200 years
ago.34
Polanyi's discussion of language also has a bearing on the argument advanced above that specialized code words or expressions can and do arise in
the context of recurring transactions and that these yield economies. As he
puts it, "Different vocabularies for the interpretation of things divide men
into groups which cannot understand each other's way of seeing things and
acting upon them."35 And subsequently he remarks that:
To know a language is an art, carried on by tacit judgments and the practice of
unspecifiable skills .... Spoken communication is the successful application by two
persons of the linguistic knowledge and skill acquired by such apprenticeship, one
person wishing to transmit, the other to receive, information. Relying on what each
has learnt, the speaker confidently utters words and the listener confidently interprets
them, while they mutually rely on each other's correct use and understanding of these
words. A true communication will take place if, and only if, these combined assumptions of authority and trust are in fact justified.36
Babbage reports a remarkable example of transaction-specific value in
exchange that occurred in the early 1800s. Although he attributes the continuing exchange in the face of adversity to values of "established character"
(trust), I believe there were other specialized human and physical investments involved as well. In any event, the circumstance which he describes is
the following:
The influence of established character in producing confidence operated in a very
remarkable manner at the time of the exclusion of British manufactures from the
Continent during the last war. One of our largest establishments had been in the

Christian name of one of the firm, and even in some instances they were without any
signature at all. These orders were executed; and in no instance was there the least
irregularity in the payments.37
While most of these illustrations refer to technical and commercial transactions, other types of transactions also have an idiosyncratic quality. Justice
Rhenquist refers to some of these when speaking of the general class of cases
where "the litigation of an individual's claim of deprivation of a right would
bring parties who must remain in a continuing relationship into the adversarial atmosphere of a courtroom"38-which
atmosphere he plainly regards as
detrimental to the quality of the relationship. Examples that he offers include reluctance to have the courts mediate collective bargaining disputes39
and to allow children to bring suit against parents.40
But surely we must ask what is distinctive about these transactions. I
submit that transaction-specific human capital is central to each. Why else
would it take the Hungarians so long to operate the German light-bulb
machine? And what else explains the loss of Stradivarius's craftsmanship?
Likewise the understanding and trust which evolve between Babbage's
transmitter and receiver are valued human assets which, once developed,
will be sacrificed with reluctance. And the disruption of continuing relationships to which Justice Rhenquist refers occasions concern precisely because
there are no adequate substitutes for these idiosyncratic relations.41

COMMERCIALCONTRACTING

The discussion of commercial contracting begins with a brief statement on
economizing. The proposed schema for characterizing transactions and their
governance is then developed, including the relation of the schema with
Macneil's three-way classification of contract.
A. Economizing
The criterion for organizing commercial transactions is assumed to be the
strictly instrumental one of cost economizing. Essentially this takes two
parts: economizing on production expense and economizing on transaction
costs.42 To the degree that transaction costs are negligible, buying rather
than making will normally be the most cost-effective means of procurement.43 Not only can static scale economies be more fully exhausted by
buying rather than making, but the supplier who aggregates uncorrelated
demands can realize collective pooling benefits as well. Since external procurement avoids many of the bureaucratic hazards of internal procurement
(which hazards, however, are themselves of a transaction-cost kind),44 external procurement is evidently warranted.45
As indicated, however, the object is to economize on the sum of production and transaction costs. To the degree production-cost economies of external procurement are small and/or the transaction costs associated with
external procurement are great, alternative supply arrangements deserve
serious consideration. Economizing on transaction costs essentially reduces
42More generally, the economizing problem includes choice between a special-purpose and a
general-purposegood or service. A general-purpose item affords all of the advantages of market
procurement, but possibly at the sacrifice of valued design or performance characteristics. A
special-purpose item has the opposite features: valued differences are realized but market
procurement here may pose hazards. For the purposes of this paper, intermediate-product
characteristicsare mainly taken as given and I focus principally on production and transactioncost economies. A more general formulation would include product characteristics in the optimization.
43This ignores transient conditions, such as temporary excess- capacity. (In a zerotransaction-costworld, such excesses vanish as assets can be deployed as effectively by others as
they can by the owner.)
44On these hazards and their transaction-cost origins, see Oliver E. Williamson,
supra note
1, at 117-31.
4S Dennis Carlton shows that economies of "vertical integration" can
frequently be realized in
a market where, absent integration, buyers and suppliers are randomly paired. As he defines
vertical integration, however, this can be accomplished as effectively by long-term contract as it
can by in-house production. Dennis W. Carlton, Vertical Integration in Competitive Markets
under Uncertainty, 27 J. Indus. Econ. 189 (1979).

<-----Page 14----->246

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

to economizing on bounded rationality while simultaneously safeguarding
the transactions in question against the hazards of opportunism. Holding the
governance structure constant, these two objectives are in tension, since a
reduction in one commonly results in an increase in the other.46
Governance structures, however, are properly regarded as part of the
optimization problem. For some transactions, a shift from one structure to
another may permit a simultaneous reduction in both the expense of writing
a complex contract (which economizes on bounded rationality) and the expense of executing it effectively in an adaptive, sequential way (by attenuating opportunism). Indeed, this is precisely the attraction of internal procurement for transactions of a recurrent, idiosyncratic kind. Not only are
market-aggregation economies negligible for such transactions--since the
requisite investments are transaction-specific-but market trading in these
circumstances is shot through with appropriable quasi-rent hazards. The
issues here have been developed elsewhere.47 The object of this paper is to
integrate them into a larger contractual framework.
Note in this connection that the prospect of recovering the set-up costs
associated with specialized governance structures varies with the frequency
with which transactions recur. Specialized governance structures are much
easierto justify for recurrent transactions than for identical transactions that
occur only occasionally.
B. Characterizing Transactions
I asserted earlier that the critical dimensions for describing contractual
relations are uncertainty, the frequency with which transactions recur, and
the degree to which investments are idiosyncratic. To simplify the exposition, I will assume uncertainty exists in some intermediate degree and focus
initially on frequency and the degree to which the expenses incurred are
transaction-specific. The separate importance of uncertainty will then be
developed in Section III.D. Three frequency and three investment categories
will be recognized. Frequency can be characterized as one-time, occasional,
and recurrent; and investments are classed as nonspecific, mixed, and
idiosyncratic. To further simplify the argument, the following assumptions
aremade: (1) Suppliers intend to be in business on a continuing basis; thus
thespecial hazards posed by fly-by-night firms can be disregarded. (2) Potentialsuppliers forany given requirement are numerous-which is to say that
exante monopoly in ownership of specialized resources is assumed away. (3)
46Thus a reduction in monitoring commonly gives rise to an increase in opportunism. Monitoring the employment relation, however, needs to be done with special care. Progressively
increasingthe intensity of surveillance canelicit resentment and have counterproductive (for
example, work-to-rule) results. Such perversities are less likely forinterfirm trading.
47See note 30 supra.

<-----Page 15----->247

TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS

The frequency dimension refers strictly to buyer activity in the market.48 (4)
The investment dimension refersto the characteristicsof investments made by
suppliers.49
Although discrete transactions are intriguing-for example, purchasing
local spirits from a shopkeeper in a remote area of a foreign country to which
one never again expects to visit nor to refer his friends-few transactions
have this totally isolated character. For those that do not, the difference
between one-time and occasional transactions is not apparent. Accordingly,
only occasional and recurrent frequency distinctions will be maintained. The
two-by-three matrix shown in Figure I thus describes the six types of transactions to which governance structures need to be matched. Illustrative
transactions appear in the cells.

C. Governance Structures
Three broad types of governance structures will be considered: nontransaction-specific, semi-specific, and highly specific. The market is the
classic nonspecific governance structure within which "faceless buyers and
sellers . . . meet ...
for an instant to exchange standardized goods at

49 Production aspects are thus emphasized. Investments in governance structure are treated

<-----Page 16----->248

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

equilibrium prices."50 By contrast, highly specific structures are tailored to
the special needs of the transaction. Identity here clearly matters. Semispecific structures, naturally, fall in between. Several propositions are suggested immediately. (1) Highly standardized transactions are not apt to require specialized governance structure. (2) Only recurrent transactions will
support a highly specialized governance structure.51 (3) Although occasional
transactions of a nonstandardized kind will not support a transactionspecific governance structure, they require special attention nonetheless. In
terms of Macneil's three-way classification of contract, classical contracting
presumably applies to all standardized transactions (whatever the frequency), relational contracting develops for transactions of a recurring and
nonstandardized kind, and neoclassical contracting is needed for occasional,
nonstandardized transactions.
1. Market Governance: Classical Contracting. Market governance is the
main governance structure for nonspecific transactions of both occasional
and recurrent contracting. Markets are especially efficacious when recurrent
transactions are contemplated, since both parties need only consult their
own experience in deciding to continue a trading relationship or, at little
transitional expense, turn elsewhere. Being standardized, alternative purchase and supply arrangements are presumably easy to work out.
Nonspecific but occasional transactions are ones for which buyers (and
sellers) are less able to rely on direct experience to safeguard transactions
against opportunism. Often, however, rating services or the experience of
other buyers of the same good can be consulted. Given that the good or
service is of a standardized kind, such experience rating, by formal and
informal means, will provide incentives for parties to behave responsibly.
To be sure, such transactions take place within and benefit from a legal
framework. But such dependence is not great. As S. Todd Lowry puts it,
"the traditional economic analysis of exchange in a market setting properly
corresponds to the legal concept of sale (rather than contract), since sale
presumes arrangements in a market context and requires legal support
primarily in enforcing transfers of title."52 He would thus reserve the concept of contract for exchanges where, in the absence of standardized market
50Yoram Ben-Porath, supra note 29, at 7.

51Defense contracting may appear to be a counterexample, since an elaborate governance
structureis devised for many of these. This reflects in part, however, the special disabilities of
the government as a production instrument. But for this, many of these contracts would be
organizedin-house. Also, contracts that are very large and of long duration, as many defense
contractsare, do have a recurring character.

<-----Page 17----->TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS

249

alternatives, the parties have designed "patterns of future relations on which
they could rely."53
The assumptions of the discrete-contracting paradigm are rather well
satisfied for transactions where markets serve as a main governance mode.
Thus the specific identity of the parties is of negligible importance; substantive content is determined by reference to formal terms of the contract; and
legal rules apply. Market alternatives are mainly what protect each party
against opportunism by his opposite.54 Litigation is strictly for settling
claims; concentrated efforts to sustain the relation are not made because the
relation is not independently valued.55
2. Trilateral Governance: Neoclassical Contracting. The two types of
transactions for whic:, trilateral governance is needed are occasional transactions of the mixed and highly idiosyncratic kinds. Once the principals to such
transactions have entered into a contract, there are strong incentives to see
the contract through to completion. Not only have specialized investments
been put in place, the opportunity cost of which is much lower in alternative
uses, but the transfer of these assets to a successor supplier would pose
inordinate difficulties in asset valuation.56 The interests of the principals in
sustaining the relation are especially great for highly idiosyncratic transactions.
Market relief is thus unsatisfactory. Often the setup costs of a transaction-specific governance structure cannot be recovered for occasional
transactions. Given the limits of classical contract law for sustaining these
transactions, on the one hand, and the prohibitive cost of transactionspecific (bilateral) governance, on the other, an intermediate institutional
form is evidently needed.
Neoclassical contract law has many of the sought-after qualities. Thus
rather than resorting immediately to strict reliance on litigation-with its
53 Id. at 13.
S4 Although recurrent, standard transactions are ones for which an active spot market commonly exists, term contracting may also be employed--especially as planning economies are
thereby realized by the parties. See Dennis W. Carlton, Price Rigidity, Forward Contracts, and
Market Equilibrium, J. Pol. Econ. (forthcoming). The duration of these contracts will not be
long, however, since the assets in question can be employed in other uses and/or in the service of
other customers. The result is that changing market circumstances will be reflected relatively
quickly in both price and quantity and relatively stringent contracting attitudes may be said to
prevail.
55"Generally speaking, a serious conflict, even quite a minor one such as an
objection to a
harmlessly late tender of the delivery of goods, terminates the discrete contract as a live one and
leaves nothing but a conflict over money damages to be settled by a lawsuit. Such a result fits
neatly the norms of enhancing discreteness and intensifying . . . presentiation." Macneil,
Contracts 877.

transaction-rupturingfeatures-third-party assistance (arbitration)in resolving disputes and evaluating peformance is employed instead. (The use of
the architect as a relatively independent expert to determine the content of
form construction contracts is an example.)57 Also, the expansion of the
specific-performance remedy in past decades is consistent with continuity
purposes-though Macneil declines to characterize specific performance as
the "primary neoclassical contract remedy."58 The section of the Uniform
Commercial Code which permits the "seller aggrieved by a buyer's breach
. . . unilaterally to maintain the relation"59is yet another example.
3. Transaction-specific Governance: Relational Contracting. The two
types of transactions for which specialized governance structures are commonly devised are recurring transactions of the mixed and highly idiosyncratic kinds. The nonstandardized nature of these transactions makes primary reliance on market governance hazardous, while their recurrent nature
permits the cost of the specialized governance structure to be recovered.
Two types of transaction-specific governance structures for intermediateproduction market transactions can be distinguished: bilateral structures,
where the autonomy of the parties is maintained, and unified structures,
where the transaction is removed from the market and organized within the
firm subject to an authority relation (vertical integration). Bilateral structures have only recently received the attention they deserve and their operation is least well understood.
(a) Bilateral Governance: Obligational Contracting. Highly idiosyncratic
transactions are ones where the human and physical assets required for
production are extensively specialized, so there are no obvious scale economies to be realized through interfirm trading that the buyer (or seller) is
unable to realize himself (through vertical integration). In the case, however,
of mixed transactions, the degree of asset specialization is less complete.
Accordingly, outside procurement for these components may be favored by
scale-economy considerations.
As compared with vertical integration, outside procurement also is good in
eliciting cost control for steady-state supply. Problems, however, arise when
adaptability and contractual expense are considered. Whereas internal adaptations can be effected by fiat, outside procurement involves effecting adaptations across a market interface. Unless the need for adaptations has been
contemplated from the outset and expressly provided for by the contract,
57 Macneil, Contracts 866.
58 Id. at 879.
59 Id. at 880. The rationale for this section of the Code is that "identification of the goods to
the contract will, within limits, permit the seller to recover the price of the goods rather than
merely damages for the breach. . ., ([where the] latter may be far less in amount and more
difficult to prove)." Id.

<-----Page 19----->TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS

251

which often is impossible or prohibitively expensive, adaptations across a
market interface can be accomplished only by mutual, follow-on agreements. Inasmuch as the interests of the parties will commonly be at variance
when adaptation proposals (originated by either party) are made, a dilemma
is evidently posed.
On the one hand, both parties have an incentive to sustain the relationship rather than to permit it to unravel, the object being to avoid the sacrifice
of valued transaction-specific economies. On the other hand, each party
appropriates a separate profit stream and cannot be expected to accede
readily to any proposal to adapt the contract. What is needed, evidently, is
some way for declaring admissible dimensions for adjustment such that
flexibility is provided under terms in which both parties have confidence.
This can be accomplished partly by (1) recognizing that the hazards of
opportunism vary with the type of adaptation proposed and (2) restricting
adjustments to those where the hazards are least. But the spirit within which
adaptations are effected is equally important.60
Quantity adjustments have much better incentive-compatibility properties than do price adjustments. For one thing, price adjustments have an
unfortunate zero-sum quality, whereas proposals to increase, decrease, or
delay delivery do not. Also, except as discussed below, price-adjustment
proposals involve the risk that one's opposite is contriving to alter the terms
within the bilateral monopoly trading gap to his advantage. By contrast, a
presumption that exogenous events, rather than strategic purposes, are responsible for quantity adjustments is ordinarily warranted. Given the mixed
nature of the exchange, a seller (or buyer) simply has little reason to doubt
the representations of his opposite when a quantity change is proposed.
Thus buyers will neither seek supply from other sources nor divert products obtained (at favorable prices) to other uses (or users)-because other
sources will incur high setup costs and an idiosyncratic product is nonfungible across uses and users. Likewise, sellers will not withhold supply because
better opportunities have arisen, since the assets in question have a specialized character. The result is that quantity representations for idiosyncratic
products can ordinarily be taken at face value. Since inability to adapt both
quantity and price would render most idiosyncratic exchanges nonviable,
quantity adjustments occur routinely.
60As Stewart Macaulay observes, "Disputes are frequently settled without reference to the
contractor to potential or actual legal sanctions. There is a hesitancy to speak of legal right or to
threatento sue in . . . negotiations" where continuing business is valued. Stewart Macaulay,
supra note 9, at 61.
Thematerial which follows in this subsection was originally developed in connection with the
studyof inflation. See Michael L. Wachter & Oliver E. Williamson, Obligational Markets and
the Mechanics of Inflation, 9 Bell J. Econ. 549 (1978).

<-----Page 20----->252

THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS

Of course, not all price adjustments pose the same degree of hazard.
Those which pose few hazards will predictably be implemented. Crude
escalator clauses which reflect changes in general economic conditions are
one possibility. But since such escalators are not transaction-specific, imperfect adjustments often result when these escalators are applied to local conditions. We should therefore consider whether price adjustments that are more
closely related to local circumstances are feasible. The issue here is whether
interim price adjustments can be devised for some subset of conditions such
that the strategic hazards described above do not arise. What are the preconditions?
Crises facing either of the parties to an idiosyncratic exchange constitute
one class of exceptions. Faced with a viability crisis which jeopardizes the
relationship, ad hoc price relief may be permitted. More relevant and interesting, however, is whether there are circumstances whereby interim
price adjustments are made routinely. The preconditions here are two: first,
proposals to adjust prices must relate to exogenous, germane, and easily
verifiable events; and second, quantifiable cost consequences must be
confidently related thereto. An example may help to illustrate. Consider a
component for which a significant share of the cost is accounted for by a
basic material (copper, steel). Assume, moreover, that the fractional cost of
the component in terms of this basic material is well specified. An exogenous
change in prices of materials would under these circumstances pose few
hazards if partial but interim price relief were permitted by allowing passthrough according to formula. A more refined adjustment than aggregate
escalators would afford thereby obtains.
It bears emphasis, however, that not all costs so qualify. Changes in
overhead or other expenses for which validation is difficult and which, even
if verified, bear an uncertain relation to the cost of the component will not be
passed through in a similar way. Recognizing the hazards, the parties will
simply forgo relief of this kind.
(b) Unified Governance: Internal Organization. Incentives for trading
weaken as transactions become progressively more idiosyncratic. The reason
is that, as the specialized human and physical assets become more specialized to a single use, and hence less transferable to other uses, economies of
scale can be as fully realized by the buyer as by an outside supplier.61 The
choiceof organizing mode then turns on which mode has superior adaptive
61This assumes that factor prices paid by buyer and outside supplier are identical. Where
thisis not true, as in some unionized firms, buyers may choose to procure outside because of a
differentialwage rate. This is a common problem in the automobile industry, which has a very
flatand relatively high wage scale.

properties. As discussed elsewhere, vertical integration will invariably appear in these circumstances.62
The advantage of vertical integration is that adaptations can be made in a
sequential way without the need to consult, complete, or revise interfirm
agreements. Where a single ownership entity spans both sides of the transactions, a presumption of joint profit maximization is warranted. Thus price
adjustments in vertically integrated enterprises will be more complete than
in interfirm trading. And quantity adjustments, of course, will be implemented at whatever frequency serves to maximize the joint gain to the
transaction.
Unchanging identity at the interface coupled with extensive adaptability
in both price and quantity is thus characteristic of highly idiosyncratic transactions which are vertically integrated. Obligational contracting is supplanted by the more comprehensive adaptive capability afforded by administration.
The match of governance structures with transactions that results from
these economizing efforts is shown in Figure II.

configuration, any governance structure will do. More relevant are transactions where uncertainty is present to an intermediate or high degree. The
foregoing has dealt with the first of these. The question here is how the
governance of transactions is affected by increasing the degree of uncertainty.
Recall that nonspecific transactions are ones for which continuity has little
value, since new trading relations are easily arranged. Increasing the degree
of uncertainty does not alter this. Accordingly, market exchange continues
and the discrete-contracting paradigm (classical contract law) holds across
standardized transactions of all kinds, whatever the degree of uncertainty.
Matters are different with transaction-specific investments. Whenever investments are idiosyncratic in nontrivial degree, increasing the degree of
uncertainty makes it more imperative that the parties devise a machinery to
"work things out"-since contractual gaps will be larger and the occasions
for sequential adaptations will increase in number and importance as the
degree of uncertainty increases. This has special relevance for the organization of transactions with mixed investment attributes. Two possibilities
exist. One would be to sacrifice valued design features in favor of a more
standardized good or service. Market governance would then apply. The
second would be to preserve the design but surround the transaction with an
elaborated governance apparatus, thereby facilitating more effective adaptive, sequential decision making. Specifically, a more elaborate arbitration
apparatus is apt to be devised for occasional, nonstandard transactions. And
bilateral governance structures will often give way to unified ones as
uncertainty is increased for recurrent transactions.
Reductions in uncertainty, of course, warrant shifting transactions in the
opposite direction. To the extent that uncertainty decreases as an industry
matures, which is the usual case, the benefits that accrue to integration
presumably decline. Accordingly, greater reliance on obligational market
contracting is commonly feasible for transactions of recurrent trading in
mature industries.
IV.

OTHERAPPLICATIONS

The three dimensions for describing transactions-frequency, investment
idiosyncrasy, and uncertainty-apply to transactions of all kinds. The same
general considerations that apply to governance structures for commercial
transactions carry over as well. The specific governance structures for organizing commercial transactions do not, however, apply without modification to the governance of other types of transactions. Applications of the
framework to the study of labor markets, regulation, family law, and capital
markets are briefly sketched here.

<-----Page 23----->TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS

255

A. Labor
Occasional labor-market transactions typically take the form of repair or
replacement services-the plumber, electrician, and so forth. Especially in
older homes or structures, these transactions can take on an idiosyncratic
quality. Although such transactions can be interesting, the transactions on
which I want to focus are recurrent labor-market transactions of the
nonspecific, mixed, and idiosyncratic kinds.
Clyde Summers's examination of collective agreements in relation to the
law of contracts disclosed that, while the collective bargain differed greatly
from the ordinary bargain of commerce, collective agreements are nonetheless a part of the "mainstream of contract."63He suggested that the study of
contract proceed on two levels: the search for an underlying framework and,
within that framework, an examination of the distinctive institutional attributes that distinguish each type of transaction. With respect to the first of
these he conjectured that "the principles common to the whole range of
contractual transactions are relatively few and of such generality and competing character that they should not be stated as legal rules at all."64
I am persuaded that Summers's two-part strategy for studying contract
leads to a deeper understanding of the issues. And I believe that the framework set out in the preceding sections of this paper provides much of the
underlying unity called for by Summers. What differs as one moves across
various contracting activities is the institutional infrastructure.
(1) Nonspecific Transactions. Nonspecific labor-market transactions are
ones where employer and employee are largely indifferent to the identity of
each. Migrant farm labor is an example. Although an unchanging employment association between firm and worker may be observed to continue
over long intervals for some of these employees, each party is essentially
meeting bids in the spot market. A valuable ongoing relationship, in which
specific training and on-the-job learning yield idiosyncratic benefits, is thus
not implied. Both wages and employment are variable and market governance applies to transactions of this kind. Consider, therefore, mixed and
idiosyncratic labor-market transactions.
(2) Mixed Transactions. Probably the most interesting labor-market
transactions are those where large numbers of workers acquire an intermediate degree of firm-specific skill. Note that, inasmuch as the degree of
idiosyncrasy is a design variable, firms would presumably redesign jobs to
favor more standardized operations if it were impossible to devise governance structures which prevented antagonistic bargaining relations from
developing between firms and idiosyncratically skilled employees. Although

Justice Rhenquist has observed that "Adjudicatory review of the decisions
of certain institutions, while perhaps insuring a 'better'
decision in some
objective sense, can only disrupt on-going relationships within the
institution and thereby hamper the institution's ability to serve its
designated
societal function."65Examples of
adjudicatory review with respect to which
he counsels caution include collective bargaining
agreements.
The reasons for this are that adjudicatory review is not
easily apprised of
thespecial needs of the transaction and the prospect of such
review impairs
the incentive of the parties to devise bilateral governance
structure. The
Vacav. Stipes holding, which Justice Rhenquist cites, is
fully consistent with
thisinterpretation. There the Court held that an individual could
not compel

otherwise

undermined,thus . . . [introducing] the vagaries of independent and unsystematicnegotiations."66 Archibald Cox elaborates as follows:67

events unfold. Given that valuable firm-specific training and learning reside
in the workers, layoffs with a presumption of reemployment when conditions improve are common. Conformably, the degree to which the machinery governing access to jobs is elaborated ought to vary directly with the
degree to which jobs in a firm are idiosyncratic. Thus promotion ladders in
firms where a succession of interdependent jobs are highly idiosyncratic
should be long and thin, with access mainly restricted to the bottom,
whereas promotion ladders in nonidiosyncratic activities should be broadly
structured.69Likewise, promotion on merit ought to be favored over promotion strictly by seniority in firms where jobs are more idiosyncratic.70
(3) Highly Idiosyncratic Transactions. Recall that idiosyncratic transactions involve not merely uniqueness but uniqueness of a transaction-specific
kind. Also recall that our concern in this section is with recurring transactions. Thus, although there are many uniquely skilled individuals (artists,
athletes, researchers, administrators), unique skills are rarely of a transaction-specific kind. On the contrary, most of these individuals could move to
another organization without significant productivity losses.
The exceptions are those where the benefits which accrue to experience
(inside knowledge) and/or team interaction effects are great. Whereas commercial transactions of a highly idiosyncratic nature are unified under a
common ownership, limits on indenture foreclose this option for labormarket transactions. Instead of "merger," complex contracts designed to tie
the interests of the individual to the organization on a long-term basis are
negotiated. Severe penalties are provided should either party seek unilateral
termination. Nonvested, long-term, contingent reward schemes are devised.
More generally, transaction-specific infrastructure will be highly individuated for such transactions.
B. Regulation of Natural Monopoly
Again the argument is that specialized governance structure is needed to
the degree efficient supply necessarily joins buyers and sellers in a bilateral
69Michael L. Wachter & Oliver E. Williamson, supra note 60, at 567.
70 Thus although both nonidiosyncratic and idiosyncratic jobs may be organized collectively,

the way in which the internal labor markets associated with each are organized should reflect
objective differences between them. Additionally, the incentive to provide an orderly governance structure varies directly with the degree to which efficiencies are attributable thereto.
Ceterisparibus, nonidiosyncratic jobs ought to be organized later and the governance structure
less fully elaborated than for idiosyncratic jobs. Both propositions are borne out by the evidence.

trading relation of a continuing nature. And again, the object of governance
is to (1) protect the interests of the respective parties and (2) adapt the
relationship to changing circumstances.
Although differing in details, both Victor Goldberg71and I72 have argued
that specialized governance structure is needed for services for which natural
monopoly features are great. Such structure presumably has the purpose of
providing sellers (investors) and buyers with security of expectations, which
is a protective function, while at the same time facilitating adaptive, sequential decision making. Rate-of-return regulation with periodic review has
these features. To the extent, however, that such regulation is observed in
conjunction with activities where transaction-specific investments are insubstantial (as, for example, in the trucking industry), the case for regulation is
not at all apparent-or, if it is to be made, must appeal to arguments very
different from those set out here.

C. Family Law
The issue here is whether the role of adjudication should be expanded to
help govern family relationships. Granting that adjudication as ultimate
reliefcan and often does serve a useful role for sustaining family relations,
such relations are plainly idiosyncratic to an unusual degree and a specializedgovernance structure is surely the main mode of governance. As the role
of adjudication is expanded, reliance upon internal structure is apt to be
reduced.Therefore, except when individual rights are seriously threatened,
withholding access to adjudication may be indicated.
JusticeRhenquist's remarks concerning the corrosive effects of adversary
hearingson the family are apposite: "Anysort of adversary hearing which
pits parent against child is bound to be disruptive, placing stresses and
tensionson the intra-familial relationships which in turn weaken the family
asan institution."73 Whether, as this suggests, parent-child family relations

areoptimized where adjudication is zero or negligible is beyond the scope of
thispaper. It suffices for my purposes merely to note that valued family
relationsare recurrent and idiosyncratic and that a specialized, transactionspecificgovernance structure must be encouraged lest the parties withhold
investingheavily in the institution.74

D. Capital Market Transactions
The ease of verification is critical to the operation of capital markets.75
Where verification is easy, markets work well and additional governance is
unnecessary. Where verification is difficult or very difficult, however, additional governance may be indicated. Occasional transactions are apt to benefit from third-party assistance, while recurring transactions are ones for
which bilateral or unified governance will presumably be observed. Assessing capital-market transactions within the proposed framework is thus
accomplished by substituting "ease of verification" for "degree of transaction-specific investment." Once this is done, the governance structures
appropriate to capital markets are broadly similar to those within which
commercial transactions are organized.

IMPLICATIONS

Dimensionalizing transactions and examining the costs of executing different transactions in different ways generate a large number of institutional
implications. Some of these are summarized here.
A. General
1. Nonspecific transactions, either occasional or recurrent, are efficiently
organized by markets.
2. Occasional transactions that are nonstandardized stand most to benefit
from adjudication.
3. A transaction-specific governance structure is more fully developed
where transactions are (1) recurrent, (2) entail idiosyncratic investment, and
(3) are executed under greater uncertainty.
B. Commercial Transactions
1. Optimization of commercial transactions requires simultaneous attention to (1) production economies, (2) transaction-cost economies, and (3)
component design.
2. The reason why Macaulay observes so few litigated cases in business76
is because markets work well for nonspecific transactions, while recurrent,
nonstandard transactions are governed by bilateral or unified structures.
3. As uncertainty increases, the obligational market-contracting mode
will not be used for recurrent transactions with mixed investment features.
Such transactions will either be standardized, and shifted to the market, or
organized internally.
75 This feature was called to my attention by Sanford Grossman.

4. As generic demand grows and the number of supply sources increases,
exchange that was once transaction-specific loses this characteristic and
greater reliance on market-mediated governance is feasible. Thus vertical
integration may give way to obligational market contracting, which in turn
may give way to markets.
5. Where inventory and related flow-process economies are great, sitespecific supply and transaction-specific governance (commonly vertical integration) will be observed. Generic demand here has little bearing.
6. The organization of the interface between manufacturing and distribution reflects similar investment considerations: goods and services that can
be sold without incurring transaction-specific investment will be distributed
through conventional marketing channels while those where such investments are great will be supported by specialized-mainly bilateral (for example, franchising) or unified (forward integration)-governance structures.
7. The governance of technical change poses special difficulties. The frequently noted limits of markets77 often give way to more complex governance relations, again for the same general reasons and along the same
generallines as are set out here.78
C. Other Transactions
1. The efficiency benefits of collective organization are negligible for
nonspecificlabor. Accordingly, such labor will be organized late, often only
with the assistance of the political process.
2. Internal labor markets become more highly individuated as jobs becomemore varied and idiosyncratic.
3. Regulation can be interpreted in part as a response to the transactional
dilemmaposed by natural monopoly.
4. A transaction-cost justification for regulating activities for which
transaction-specificinvestments are lacking (for example, trucking) is not
apparent.The possibility that politics is the driving consideration in such
industrieswarrants consideration.
5. Adjudication should proceed with caution in the area of family law lest
valuedtransaction-specific investments be discouraged.
6. Ease of verification is the capital-marketcounterpart of transactionspecificinvestments. Upon making this substitution, the organization of
capitalmarkets and intermediate-product markets is broadly similar.

CONCLUDINGREMARKS

Transaction-cost economics is an interdisciplinary undertaking that joins
economics with aspects of organization theory and overlaps extensively with
contract law. It is the modern counterpart of institutional economics and
relies heavily on comparative analysis.79 Frictionless ideals are useful mainly
for reference purposes.
Although mathematical economics captures only a fraction of the
transaction-cost phenomena of interest,80this has not been the only obstacle.
Headway with the study of transaction-cost issues has been impeded by lack
of verbal definitions. Identifying the critical dimensions with respect to
which transactions differ has been a significant omission.
This paper attempts to rectify this deficiency and identifies uncertainty,
frequency of exchange, and the degree to which investments are transaction-specific as the principal dimensions for describing transactions.
The efficient organization of economic activity entails matching governance
structures with these transactional attributes in a discriminating way.
Although the main applications in this paper are to commercial contracting, the proposed approach generalizes easily to the study of labor contracts.
Italso has ramifications for understanding both public utility regulation and
family relations. A unified approach to contract thus emerges.
Thefact that the broad features of so many varied transactions fit within
the framework is encouraging. The importance of transaction costs to the
organizationof economic activity is thus confirmed. But the world of contractis enormously complex,81 and the simple economizing framework proposedhere cannot be expected to capture more than main features. Elaboratingthe framework to deal with microanalytic phenomena, however, should
befeasible. And extending it to include additional or substitute dimensions
(ofwhich the ease of verification, in the case of capital-markettransactions,
isan example) may sometimes be necessary.
