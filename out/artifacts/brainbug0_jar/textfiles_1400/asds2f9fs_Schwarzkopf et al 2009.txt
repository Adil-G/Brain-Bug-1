(Accepted 21 October 2009)
This article investigates the role of entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs) in closing
the equity gap born by a lack of venture capital investment in early stage
businesses. We conducted interviews with 10 Israeli-based venture capitalists and
four EIRs to identify the mechanisms and actions used by EIRs when operating
in venture capital ﬁrms, and subsequently in funded ventures, that lead to a
greater proportion of funds targeted to seed investments. The ﬁndings of our
exploratory study suggest that EIRs facilitate investment decisions by acting as
catalysts in the development of the relationship between the venture capitalist and
the fund-seeking entrepreneur. EIRs can thus prevent some of the problems that
preclude venture success through the nurturing of trusted relationships with both
fund-seeking entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Furthermore, ex-ante, during
and ex-post investment, through building these trusted relationships, EIRs act as
transaction-cost reducers, thus increasing expected return on investments from
early stage ventures. In an attempt to help reduce the equity gap by developing a
better understanding of this key phenomenon, these ﬁndings provide guidance to
rising entrepreneurs as they develop their early stage businesses, to venture
capitalists as they look for investment opportunities, and to governments eager to
increase the rate of seed funding.

Introduction
Obtaining venture capital (VC) is critical for high growth potential companies, but is
increasingly problematic for seed ventures due to ‘the economics of the investment
appraisal and monitoring processes’ (Mason and Harrison 1992, 377). Mason and
Harrison (1995) identify an equity gap attributed to the ‘evaluation and monitoring
costs which must precede and accompany venture capital investments [and] are a
signiﬁcant ﬁxed cost element, which makes it uneconomic for funds to make
investments of less than about £250,000’ (Mason and Harrison 1995, 155). These
costs arise from the practices of venture capitalists (VCs) who incur transaction
expenses ex-ante, during and ex-post investment, in order to reduce their perceived
risk in the investment (Van Osnabrugge 2000). Given the ﬁxed nature of these
transaction expenses, they constitute a much higher percentage of the investment

amount in seed funding compared to investments made in later stages of funding
where investments are larger. In this article we explore how entrepreneurs-inresidence (EIRs) can decrease these costs, reduce the equity gap and increase VC
funds that ﬂow into early stage ventures.
EIRs are particularly active in Israel, found in 31% of VC ﬁrms who invest in
seed ventures in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector
(Schwarzkopf 2007). Since 1995, the Israeli economy has had an inﬂow of US$43
billion in ICT investments including US$16 billion of direct VC investments (Myre
2005) of which seed ventures represent 8% (Israel Venture Capital Association
2008). Israeli VCs view the utilization of EIRs in an internship program as a critical
mechanism that allows for these high rates of seed funding compared, for instance,
to the US with only 4% of VC funds in seed ventures (PWC Moneytree 2008).
Previous research on the role of EIRs has been limited, with only one key study
(Rosenblatt and Thelen 1997) that suggests that an EIR’s role is to both attract more
fund-seeking entrepreneurs and improve the likelihood of success of funded
ventures. However, since there are other mechanisms (such as the recruitment by
VCs of experienced CEOs) that appear to replicate these eﬀects, these explanations
alone are insuﬃcient to explain the higher rates of seed funding (and speciﬁcally how
EIRs reduce the equity gap). This leads to our research questions: What is the role of
the EIR in reducing the transaction costs that cause the equity gap that inhibits seed
investments? Speciﬁcally, how does an EIR working with an Israeli VC and the fundseeking entrepreneur build a relationship able to reduce each transaction cost
component normally encountered in VC investment?
We address this question by exploring theoretically and empirically how investors
can reduce their investment risks, especially those born from the relationship risk
introduced by allowing a fund-seeking entrepreneur to manage a funded venture.
Understanding the nature of the transaction costs introduced into the VC–
entrepreneur relationship allows us to characterize how, through the development
of mutual trust, an EIR can enable the development of a relational contract that
complements the more formal agreement. We adopt a qualitative research method
for this exploratory study and draw conclusions on how the presence of an EIR
inﬂuences the perceptions and behaviors of both VC and fund-seeking entrepreneur.
Our interviews with 10 Israeli-based VCs and four EIRs allow us to identify how
EIRs act as catalysts for investment. We also extract data from our interviews to
explain how a VC chooses an EIR who can identify opportunities, overcome VCs’
past investment problems, boost expected returns, and who can nurture trusted
relationships with VC partners and the fund-seeking entrepreneur. Our insights can
be used to explain how EIRs are able to reduce the equity gap and increase the rate
of funding in seed ventures.
Reducing investors’ perceived relationship risk
A VC making a seed-investment decision must consider the performance risk and the
relationship risk rooted in two diﬀerent domains: the former in the competitive
environment, the latter in partners’ cooperation. Performance risk is the likelihood
of achieving expected outcomes, given full cooperation by both partners (Das and
Teng 1996). Relationship risk occurs because the investor must engage an
entrepreneur to manage the enterprise, whose decisions may not always align with
those of the investor (Das and Teng 2001). Relationship risk, also known as agency

<-----Page 3----->Venture Capital

risk, has two components (Fama and Jensen 1983): moral hazard, arising when the
two parties have diverging interests; and adverse selection born from information
asymmetry between the two parties. Moral hazard can lead the fund-seeking
entrepreneur to take actions that are beneﬁcial to her/him but detrimental to the VC.
Adverse selection can lead the fund-seeking entrepreneur to fail to recognize her/his
lack of knowledge, which can result in poor decisions.
To reduce the relationship risk perceived by the VC to an acceptable level, the VC
must achieve a level of conﬁdence in the future behaviors of the entrepreneur.
Typically, the VC accomplishes this by undertaking due diligence on the previous
behaviors of the entrepreneur – seen as an indication of future behaviors, and
introducing control clauses into the shareholder agreement (Barney et al. 1994; Fiet
1995; Kaplan and Strömberg 2003). However, due diligence and the monitoring of
control clauses introduce transaction costs, which reduce the expected return of an
investment because limited resources are then diverted away from business
development. This reduction in return often reaches the point where the VC’s
expected returns cannot be achieved especially in seed investing where these
transaction costs are a relatively high percentage of the investment amount.
Consequently, the potentially good seed-investment opportunity does not take place.
Barney and Hansen (1994) argue that relationship risk can also be reduced by the
development of interpersonal relationships to the point where they can substitute for
costly controls. These relationships require the development of interpersonal trust
(Harrison, Dibben, and Mason 1997) that facilitates the development of investor–
entrepreneur relational contracts (Casadesus-Masanell 2004). This suggests that an
alternative model for the relationship between investor and fund-seeking entrepreneur
might rely more on stewardship theory than agency theory (Arthurs and Busenitz
2003). Developing trust-based relational contracts requires time, which is usually in
short supply during the direct interactions between investor and fund-seeking
entrepreneur. Lewicki and Bunker (1996) note the staged nature of such interactions,
suggesting that higher levels of trust, known as identiﬁcation-based trust, can only be
reached when each party understands, appreciates and anticipates the other’s wants.
As Flores and Solomon (1998) note, trust development is slow, starting from an
anchored position created by each party’s initial trust perception of the other based on
their predisposition and initial impression, which, as argued in Shepherd and
Zacharakis (2001), is then modiﬁed over time by the reciprocal display of trusting and
trustworthy behaviors from both parties. In the case of the investment decision, timeconstrained VCs do not have the patience to develop such relationships, instead
choosing to rely on the introduction of controls and their associated costs.
We elaborate on the various cost components introduced by this traditional risk
mitigation strategy using transaction cost economics theory, as shown in Table 1.
Williamson (1975) identiﬁes three types of transaction costs that reduce market
eﬃciencies and prevent otherwise worthwhile transactions from being completed: exante, negotiation and ex-post. Ex-ante costs are incurred before the transaction is
completed, and include those associated with the identiﬁcation of high potential
opportunities and the assessment and selection of opportunities that meet the
investment objectives of the VC. Negotiation costs are incurred during the investor–
entrepreneur interactions and include signiﬁcant information gathering and
veriﬁcation, as well as structuring contracts to reduce the likelihood of future risks
associated with moral hazard or adverse selection. Ex-post costs are incurred
subsequent to the investment and include ongoing monitoring of behaviors and

performance against milestones as well as enforcement costs if required. Ex-post
costs are typically the largest transaction cost component because they continue for
the life of the investment. When evaluating an investment opportunity, the VC views
all of these transaction costs as reducing perceived relationship risk, but also
reducing expected ROI. As argued by Shepherd, Armstrong, and Lévesque (2005),
balancing these costs against the VC’s time (ex-ante, during negotiations, and expost) is key, especially considering their resource constraints and the fact that much
of the eﬀort allocated ex-ante is not with ventures that become part of their
portfolio.
Mason and Harrison (1992) identify an alternative approach to introducing
costly control clauses to manage relationship risk that involves a trusted third party,
helping fund-seeking entrepreneurs understand what VCs are looking for. The role
of this third party can have even greater impact if they have a good reputation and
their incentives are aligned with the venture’s long-term success (Pollock, Porac, and
Wade 2004). We suggest that this third party, in the form of an EIR, enables the
development of a relationship contract, can reduce each component of the
transaction cost (due to that EIR’s likely impact on each cost component, as
highlighted in Table 1), and can increase the rates of seed funding. Previous research
on the role of EIRs has been limited and tended to either record individual success
stories or identify the value of the EIR as increasing the number of opportunities
presented to their host VC (Rosenblatt and Thelen 1997). We propose that the role
of the EIR is much more fundamental to relationship development, and that EIRs
make possible seed-investment decisions that otherwise might not happen due to the
perceived high relationship risk.

The role of EIRs
EIRs are recruited by a VC and paid a salary during their internship, which typically
lasts between 12 and 18 months. They are ‘high status’ individuals (Baron and
Markman 2000) with an outstanding record of accomplishment as either an
entrepreneur or a technology innovator. They are recruited to increase the quality of
opportunities presented to the VC and to enhance the long-term success of the
ventures that are funded. During their internship, they develop strong personal
relationships with VC partners and are exposed to the VC’s networks, resources and
tools. This enables the EIRs to identify emerging market segments and speciﬁc
business opportunities and resources that may be useful to future funded ventures. In
addition, EIRs often utilize their expertise to provide direct assistance to VC
portfolio ﬁrms facing speciﬁc challenges. In developing investment opportunities,
some EIRs develop their own ideas from scratch, while others work with external
entrepreneurs seeking startup ﬁnance. In both cases, the EIR plays a role in the
investment process before and after the venture is funded.
The speciﬁc role played by an EIR varies depending on their background or
interests. Also, before becoming directly involved with a speciﬁc opportunity, EIRs
are likely to ﬁrst work inside the VC ﬁrm where they develop strong trusted
relationships with VC partners while attracting opportunities and mentoring fundseeking entrepreneurs. The relationship the EIR develops with the fund-seeking
entrepreneur and their anticipated participation in the venture, post-funding,
facilitates a positive investment decision, given the existing relationship the EIR has
with the VC. This trust-based relationship is centered on the development of two

types of trust (Das and Teng 1996): goodwill trust – based on the alignment of
intention between two parties wishing to accomplish the same goals fostered when
both parties share the same values and norms; and competence trust – based on the
ability to accomplish certain goals. Goodwill trust and competence trust develop by
the trustor examining the previous performance of the trustee, often based on the
EIR’s reputation and past relationships with investors.
Further, when an EIR elects to join the fund-seeking entrepreneur and become
part of the venture’s management team, the VC’s conﬁdence in the longer-term
performance of the venture is increased. Jacobius (2004) reports on evidence from
the VC community that the presence of an EIR in a funded venture is likely to have a
direct positive impact on the value of the company at the time of a liquidity event.
EIRs’ long-term role in supporting the aligned interests of all three parties is
enhanced by their equity participation in the venture and their desire to maintain
their reputation. EIRs’ behaviors and roles are explored though our interview-based
research method described next.

Our exploratory research was designed to determine how speciﬁc mechanisms and
actions used by EIRs in VC ﬁrms and seed ventures can explain the relatively high
proportion of Israeli VC seed investments. Speciﬁcally, we wanted to understand
how the presence of an EIR in the investment decision process aﬀects the behaviors
and perceptions of the entrepreneur seeking funding and, more importantly, the VC.
We elected to use a qualitative approach, interviewing key players in a semistructured format because it permitted us to determine how EIRs operate and what
the eﬀects are of their presence. Semi-structured interviews allowed us to generate
useful information to address questions such as how the roles of EIRs changed
before, during and subsequent to the VC’s investment decision. This approach also
enabled us to probe VCs’ perceptions of highly subjective factors, such as the relative
importance of the EIR’s reputation.1
We selected 14 sample subjects through a criterion-based process, a strategy in
which particular settings, persons or activities are selected to provide information
that cannot be as easily obtained from random sampling (Miles and Huberman
1994). We selected the subjects from 57 VC ﬁrms operating in the Dan Valley region
of Israel, investing in ICT seed ventures, and operating EIR internship programs.
These ﬁrms were chosen to encompass a variety of VC sizes (in capital) and we chose
to interview the primary decision makers (CEOs) of the ﬁrst 10 VC ﬁrms who were
available. While the number of VCs interviewed was small, our sampled VCs
employed 36 EIRs, had 204 portfolio startup/seed ventures, and raised 41% of the
Israeli VC funds in the two years before our research. Their perspectives were based
on a great deal of experience with EIRs and we believe they are representative of the
Israeli VC industry. Five were satellite oﬃces of Silicon Valley VCs in Israel and ﬁve
were locally owned VC ﬁrms. Our investors were predominantly male (90%) in their
50s with extensive managerial experience; 75% of those we interviewed were repeat
entrepreneurs. They all lived in the central region of Israel, had served in the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) and were technologically competent. Our focus on VCs’ views
of EIRs was motivated by our desire to understand how the presence of an EIR
aﬀected the VCs’ perceptions of relationship risk and their investment decisionmaking process. Table 2 summarizes our data on VCs.

All selected EIRs were associated with ﬁrms where the VC had previously agreed
to be interviewed, ensuring that we would gather information on relationships
between VCs and EIRs from both perspectives to better understand them. Our EIRs
included two in the resident phase and two who had ‘graduated’ with ventures that
had received funding during the previous year. While all the EIRs interviewed were
in their 30s, they all had similar backgrounds to the investors and had strong ties
within a relatively small and interconnected community.
Our semi-structured interviews, in English, lasted about 90 minutes and took
place during July and August 2005 in the interviewees’ oﬃces. The interviews were
taped and transcribed for analysis, increasing the quality of the data that could be
extracted while ensuring participant conﬁdentiality. As highlighted in Table 3, the
questions focused on the operating practices and perceptions of EIR internship
programs, the challenges of seed investing, and experiences with overcoming seedfunding barriers with the need to consider transaction costs. Speciﬁc attention was
paid to gathering information about the constructs we had identiﬁed in our
background research, such as the display of goodwill and competence trust. We
gathered information on the importance of reputations of all parties and how the
various relationships between them evolved over time. The information we obtained
also provided insights on how the presence of an EIR aﬀected the need for additional
resources subsequent to funding.
Once we had conducted the interviews and transcribed the data, we analyzed the
content through multiple iterations, on each occasion looking to explore in depth a
diﬀerent set of factors. Our initial analysis was based on factors from previous
research, for instance about the role of the EIR and the nature of trust development.
Subsequent analysis was based on attempting a more detailed understanding of
factors observed in an earlier stage of our analysis. We used a simpliﬁed coding
system on a spreadsheet to gather, sort and record the factors we were investigating.
The initial analysis focused on extracting background information about the VC’s
prior experience with EIRs (persons and programs), their involvement in formal
internship programs, and how they funded such programs. We also determined if the

VC planned to continue with these programs and whether or not they would
recommend them to others. In our second iteration, we gathered speciﬁc data on
how the relationships between EIRs and VCs developed over time. Speciﬁcally, we
assessed whether this was more of a function of the prior reputation of each party
and the common background factors or if it was more closely linked to the actual
experiences of each party during the interactions that occurred as the relationship
developed.
In the third iteration, we looked for evidence of increasing relationship
complexity, that is, how the complex and time-dependent relationships between all
three parties developed. Our focus was to understand how the EIR inﬂuenced the
relationship between the VC and the fund-seeking entrepreneur and how this
aﬀected the investment decision. Based on our understanding of the transaction cost
components typically introduced during the relationship to reduce relationship risk,
we speciﬁcally looked for evidence of speciﬁc types of costs and how the presence of
the EIR eliminated the need for these costs to be incurred. This led to our ﬁnal
analysis, which focused on how the development of the trusted interpersonal
relationships between the three parties facilitated the actual VC investment decision,
to provide suﬃcient insights to answer our research question.

EIRs as catalysts for seed investments
The VCs noted the importance of EIRs in facilitating a positive investment decision
by acting as catalysts in the development of the relationship between the VC and the
fund-seeking entrepreneur and increasing the long-term performance of the venture.
They noted that the presence of the EIR could prevent the occurrence of problems
with invested companies and increase the likelihood of positive investment outcomes
for VCs, fund-seeking entrepreneurs and the EIRs themselves. In addition, the EIRs’
ability to build trusted relationships with both fund-seeking entrepreneur and VC
reduce each component of the transaction cost, especially the need for ongoing
monitoring and enforcement costs. Practical insights can be derived from our
interviews to highlight the catalytic function of EIRs and consequently the
characteristics VCs looked for when recruiting an EIR.

425
EIRs could have prevented VCs’ past investment problems
VCs were keen to learn from their previous mistakes and identiﬁed a number of
problems in previous funded ventures, as shown in Table 4. VCs believed the
presence of an EIR inside these ventures would have overcome many problems that
prevented venture success. In most cases, these problems created relationship risk
that could have been prevented by building higher levels of trust, which required
building trust eﬀectively through the involvement of an EIR. As one VC suggested,
‘people need to have the experience of working together, know how they think, how
they work . . . [and] there is a very high value to that trust’.

EIRs boost expected returns
VCs suggested that the primary beneﬁt of including an EIR in an investment
decision was based on her/his ability to increase the expected value of the funded
venture, based on their knowledge and experience. Quoting one interviewee,

Reasons and explanations for venture failures.

Reasons for failures

Explanations by our interviewed VCs

Entrepreneurial team in-ﬁghting
and eventual inability to perform

VCs reported that this occurred because they did
not make enough eﬀort (during due diligence) to
ensure the team was of similar backgrounds and/
or had mutual interests. It is quite common for
VCs today to change parts of the team as a
condition for investment. Our VCs believed that
common backgrounds helped to ensure more
goodwill trust among team members.
VCs noted that they look for repeat or experienced
entrepreneurs with international marketing and
sales experience, even if the ﬁrst time around they
were not successful. By including marketing/sales
prowess as part of what constitutes competence
trust, the risk of failure is reduced.
VCs reported that the most important characteristic
they look for in an entrepreneur is the ability to
understand and trust product changes dictated by
the board. VCs see goal congruence as fueling the
goodwill trust that motivates EIRs to accept their
decisions.

Poor international marketing and sales

Entrepreneur’s inability to let
go and start anew

‘most entrepreneurs do not have the experience . . . [that] EIRs are expected to
have . . . to enter into the market, build the right company [and] be successful
outside of Israel’. While VCs were often recruited because of their speciﬁc
experience and knowledge, softer characteristics like trust were not as obvious
recruitment criteria.
EIRs attract high-potential opportunities
VCs also noted that the EIRs were able to help them attract high-potential
opportunities, speciﬁcally ones that ﬁt with the VC’s investment preferences. This
was primarily a function of the industry’s perception of the EIR as an individual
with a ‘high status’ reputation, reinforced by their benevolent behaviors when
preparing the fund-seeking entrepreneur for their meetings with the VC.
EIRs nurture trusting relationships
VCs highlighted the development of a ‘referred-trust’ relationship whereby a trusted
relationship between them and EIRs and between EIRs and fund-seeking
entrepreneurs created higher levels of trust between VCs and entrepreneurs. The
need to develop this three-way relationship strengthened the VCs’ position on the
importance of trust-building ability in recruiting EIRs. A VC noted that ‘you can
talk to them [EIRs], you can evaluate their personality, their vision, their ability to
execute and take risk’. The EIR’s ability to establish trusted relationships over time
with partners was viewed as being key to the long-term success of the venture. VCs
acknowledged both aspects of a trust-based relationship: goodwill trust and
competence trust. They noted that competence trust was easier to assess, while
goodwill trust required time to develop. VCs understood that the EIR’s ability to

<-----Page 11----->Venture Capital

11

develop a trusted relationship with them before the investment gave the VC suﬃcient
conﬁdence to overcome perceived relationship risk and hence invest. As one VC
noted, ‘you trust . . . EIRs one hundred percent, one thousand percent, day and
night’.
VCs also identiﬁed how they determined goodwill and competence trust when
selecting and recruiting EIRs based on their prior record of performance. VCs
acquired information from third parties, either whom they knew or from the EIR’s
reputation in a relatively small community. These third parties included VCs’
personal networks, investors in previous EIR ventures or from ventures with whom
the EIR had established relationships. VCs noted that goodwill trust, seen as an
alignment of intention between two parties (i.e. both parties had the same goals)
could only happen as the relationship evolved over time, although it was facilitated
by the shared incentive of equity participation. As articulated by a VC, ‘we are
getting into this process of working together, I like his [the EIR] ideas . . . his ideas
ﬁt my own way of doing business and they are also good’. Given the diﬃculty
associated with determining goodwill trust, VCs were more inclined to start a
relationship when there was a high level of competence trust as opposed to
goodwill trust. VCs also attempted to build trust with fund-seeking entrepreneurs
using similar trust-building practices. VCs viewed positively any evidence that
EIRs worked well within a controlled environment and required minimal
monitoring to ensure compliance, while the need to enforce monitoring policies
was seen negatively. This initial assessment then became the anchor point for the
VC’s own perception of the EIR’s trustworthiness, which was modiﬁed over time
based on direct experience.

EIRs as transaction-cost reducers
Relationship risk is perceived to be very high in the early stage of ventures where
inexperienced entrepreneurs seeking funding have had limited time to build a
reputation or performance history. As catalysts for seed investments, EIRs were able
to reduce the perceived relationship risk and reduce the transaction costs associated
with the introduction of risk-reducing control mechanisms. The VC developed a
trusted resource, the EIR, who could be deployed when a seed-investment
opportunity arose and the VC had insuﬃcient time to build the required level of
trust with the fund-seeking entrepreneur. In further investigating the mechanisms
and actions that EIRs used when operating in Israeli VC ﬁrms, we found they
reduced each of the transaction cost components identiﬁed as contributing to the
equity gap. We now discuss how the EIRs reduce each of the six components of the
transaction cost.

EIRs reduce deal identiﬁcation costs
Part of the EIR’s mandate was to engage with local communities to identify
potential investment opportunities and encourage fund-seeking entrepreneurs to
contact the VC with whom that EIR was associated. A combination of
entrepreneurs’ increased awareness of the VC and a more favorable view of the
VC, brought about by the EIR, increased the number of entrepreneurs applying for
funding. The association of an EIR with a VC thus encouraged more early stage
ventures to seek ﬁnancing from that VC, although we found that the actual number

of ventures depended on the EIR’s reputation. The presence of an EIR thus resulted
in reducing the deal identiﬁcation component of ex-ante costs.
EIRs reduce deal selection costs
EIRs engaged directly with fund-seeking entrepreneurs to help raise their
likelihood of receiving an investment by making them ‘investable’. This action
inﬂuenced the likelihood that the fund-seeking entrepreneur would be selected to
move to the next stage of interaction with the VC. During this process, the EIR
(who had already developed a strong relationship with the VC) started to build a
personal relationship with the fund-seeking entrepreneur. The development of this
relationship was facilitated by the context of their previous interactions, where they
worked together to increase the likelihood of receiving investment. This relationship facilitated the disclosure of ‘private’ information, increasing the eﬃciency of
the interaction at an early stage when the greatest level of information asymmetry
existed. The presence of the EIR therefore increased the ‘investability’ of the
venture and the eﬃciency of the interaction, which reduced the deal selection
component of ex-ante costs.
EIRs reduce contracting costs
Contracting was characterized by discussions that developed into a shareholder
agreement as well as an agreement on the percentage of equity each party would
receive from the new venture. The presence of the EIR allowed both parties to
rapidly conclude an agreement. As a VC noted, ‘the EIR helped us with domain
expertise . . . helped us in our deal ﬂow. When we found a company he led the due
diligence process’. When the EIR proposed to join the funded venture and the fundseeking entrepreneur agreed, the negotiations were facilitated because the VC could
expect the value of the funded venture to be higher than without the EIR on board.
The VC also would anticipate a reduced likelihood of moral hazard from the now
funded entrepreneur, thus reducing the need for as many monitoring clauses to be
incorporated in the shareholder agreement. In addition, the entrepreneur would have
more conﬁdence that the VC would continue allocating suﬃcient resources to the
venture. The combination of these factors reduced the contracting component of
negotiation costs.

EIRs reduce due diligence costs
Due diligence took place during the VC’s selection of fund-seeking entrepreneurs to
which s/he would issue a term sheet. The existing relationship between the EIR and
fund-seeking entrepreneur diminished information asymmetry between the parties.
An additional beneﬁt was the perception that the EIR provided a perspective of a
third party who would ostensibly not favor either party to the negotiation, since the
long-term incentives of the EIR were also aligned with the fund-seeking
entrepreneur. Further, the anticipated role of the EIR in the venture and
introduction of a compensation plan that aligned the objectives of each party
reduced the need for as thorough a due diligence as would be necessary if no
EIR–entrepreneur relationship existed. As an EIR noted, ‘the experience of being
inside the VC ﬁrm – where they could more easily understand its mechanisms and

<-----Page 13----->Venture Capital

13

goals – was extremely helpful in later due diligence and board dealings’. As a result,
the due diligence component of negotiation costs was reduced.
590
EIRs reduce monitoring costs
The long-term engagement of the EIR in the venture allowed for less complete
shareholder contracts that could foresee every eventuality, which reduced the overall
level of monitoring required. The presence of the EIR in the venture further reduced
the eﬀort required to implement the smaller number of monitoring clauses in the
contract. As a result, resources that might otherwise have been used for ex-post
monitoring were retained for business development. These factors combined to
reduce the monitoring component of ex-post costs.

595

600
EIRs reduce enforcement costs
VCs expected greater startup compliance due to the relationships that the EIR had
established with the fund-seeking entrepreneur and the VC. For fund-seeking
entrepreneurs, their established relationships with the EIR enabled them to better
understand and carry out the clauses of the shareholder agreement. Therefore,
subsequent to the decision to invest, the long-term involvement of the EIR in the
funded venture led to fewer resources being diverted from business development to
enforcement and, as a result, a reduction in the enforcement component of ex-post
costs.

Concluding remarks
Nearly 50% of the ventures using an EIR in our sample were successful in attracting
ﬁnancing. One VC reported that in the four and a half years since his VC ﬁrm had
started, they had looked at close to 1500 companies and invested in 24. For business
ventures in which an EIR was involved, this ratio improved to two out of ﬁve.
Nevertheless, the impact of the EIR on the rates of ICT seed investment in Israel
should not be considered in isolation. Other factors can account for Israel’s higher
rates than other countries. The close-knit ICT community in Israel and the Dan
Valley creates a particularly high level of trust and an innovation culture that
permeate the community. This reduces the perception of relationship risk due to
factors such as participants’ prior and (concern for) future reputations in the
community, strong social networks, and a homogeneous cultural and religious
background. Frequently mentioned was common institutional background in the
Israeli Defense Force. As noted by one VC, ‘where you were in the army will
inﬂuence my decision . . . [I look for] . . . someone who came from a certain
background . . . went through certain things and can do diﬃcult things . . .’. In
addition, our interviewees (VCs and EIRs) regarded governmental policies to
support the commercialization of research and early stage venture ﬁnancing that
leverage equity investments as important programs (because most are designed to
reduce perceived risk and increase potential returns). Syndication of investments was
further regarded as a risk-reduction mechanism that was common between VCs in
the Dan Valley.
Furthermore, the special investment company created by the VC to fund the EIR
is also important in explaining the success of the EIR program. The investment

company pays the EIR’s salary out of the VC’s investment fund rather than the
management expense ratio, with the investment company folded into the funded seed
venture once the deal is done. This funding instrument allows VCs to overcome the
constraint placed on them through the imposition of a ceiling on the management
expense ratio, which limits the amount of money a VC can spend on management
expenses as a percentage of the total investment portfolio.
Our research further highlights the importance of transaction costs in creating a
barrier to seed investing. We ﬁnd evidence in the Israeli context that these costs can
be reduced by the development of trusted relationships. The introduction of an EIR
facilitates the time-consuming trust-building process over many months. In contrast,
investment decisions typically occur far more quickly, making trust development
more challenging. The EIR builds a trust repository with the VC and subsequently
with the fund-seeking entrepreneur. These relationships built on trust facilitate the
investment decision. Further, the manner in which EIRs reduce the various
components of the transaction cost provides speciﬁc insights that might allow some
of the mechanisms used by EIRs to be replicated in order to increase the overall rate
of seed investment.
Practitioners involved in investing in seed ventures will beneﬁt from a better
understanding of the nature of the various transaction cost components they incur
when they introduce risk mitigation strategies (i.e. controls). This will encourage VCs
to review the costs and beneﬁts of introducing such strategies and may cause them to
modify their current risk mitigation practices. Our research identiﬁes how the
development of relational contracts can reduce the costs of controls. Investors might
identify how they can engage trust catalysts to enhance the number of opportunities in
which they achieve the conﬁdence to invest. Further, a better understanding of why
investors introduce controls to mitigate risk, and the associated costs these incur, will
encourage funders to relax pressure on management expense ratios, where high levels
are assumed to be due to VCs’ ineﬃciency rather than responsible risk mitigation.
Governments interested in increasing the number of seed ventures that can
attract funding will also beneﬁt from a better understanding of the impacts of
transaction costs. Based on our insights, governments can now look at speciﬁc
strategies to reduce these costs, in addition to the traditional approach of subsidizing
equity ﬁnance. While governments could encourage the deployment of EIRs, they
could reduce, for instance, identiﬁcation costs by increasing networking activities.
Contracting costs could also be reduced by subsidizing qualiﬁed third parties to
facilitate investment decisions.
Our research should also be of interest to researchers attempting to explore
relationship development between organizations and encourage them to broaden their
approach to consider both stewardship theory (Arthurs and Busenitz 2003) and the
development of relational contracts (Casadesus-Masanell 2004) as an alternative to
traditional agency theory (Eisenhardt 1989). Researchers interested in exploring the
behaviors of entrepreneurs, their ventures and strategic relationships may beneﬁt from
examining the psychology literature on the development of close personal relationships (Rempel, Holmes, and Zanna 1985) and speciﬁcally the characteristics of fundseeking entrepreneurs and VCs that enable them to build relational contracts.
We believe that the application of a transaction-cost model to the investment
process provides an opportunity for future research, especially when looking at
optimizing transaction costs across diﬀerent stages of the investment process. Such
an approach could build on Shepherd, Armstrong, and Lévesque’s (2005) work that

<-----Page 15----->Venture Capital

15

looks at the optimization of time utilization by VCs, who spend a percentage of their
time identifying new opportunities, negotiating investments and managing current
investments. As the costs incurred at each stage have a direct eﬀect on subsequent
costs, considering the costs and beneﬁts of incurring transaction costs at each stage of
the investment process (and the impact of those costs on the investment decision itself)
could be a fruitful research endeavor. Also, evaluating the true impact of EIRs on
long-term venture success, whether this was due to their ability to reduce transaction
costs, ‘scout’ high potential opportunities, or, as Baum and Silverman (2004) put it,
‘coach’ funded ventures to success, could provide a promising line of research.
We therefore hope that our exploratory attempt stimulates much further
research, especially to address some of our limitations. We collected qualitative data
on how EIR internship programs function in Israel. As portrayed in Table 2, since 9
out of the 10 VCs interviewed expressed their intent to continue funding EIR
programs, exploring these programs elsewhere may be valuable. The values and
norms in Israel, especially the homogeneous nature of a small and well-connected
community, might not be the same in other countries, thus practices may be diﬀerent
and operate on culture-based factors that inﬂuence the role of EIRs. Additionally,
our conclusions have been limited by our small sample size. Enlarging the number of
participants to include fund-seeking entrepreneurs and angel investors could provide
more insights. We also undertook the research over a relatively short period, during
which investments had already been made. Expanding the time horizon might
provide additional insights on the investment decision process itself and on the
longer-term impact of initial conditions on venture success. We hope that others join
us in the eﬀort to comprehend the causes of the equity gap, to understand how EIR
programs help develop relational contracts that reduce transaction costs, and, as a
result, to increase the number of seed ventures that VCs can fund.

Qualitative data analysis is common in the sociology literature, for instance, and can be
done using two alternative approaches. In the ﬁrst, interview data are transcribed and
segments extracted to support speciﬁc viewpoints. In the second, there is a greater attempt
to determine the frequency of speciﬁc words or expressions, their magnitude and time of
occurrence. We chose the former and utilized a common research tool, Microsoft
OneNote 2003, with notebook capability to record data. This software allows for
continuous sorting and resorting of the data, which can then be re-categorized. The latter
approach (used e.g. in a tool like nVivo) was not used because the level of reﬁnement it
oﬀers provides unnecessary details for the purpose of our exploratory study.
