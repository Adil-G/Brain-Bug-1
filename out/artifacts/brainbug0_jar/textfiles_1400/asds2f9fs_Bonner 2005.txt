Reflexivity and Interpretive Sociology:

Abstract. This paper addresses the problem of reflexivity in modern social inquiry in general and in sociology in particular. This problem is inherited from Weber’s very conception
of sociology, is transformed by phenomenology and ethnomethodology, deepened by the linguistic turn of hermeneutics and Wittgenstein’s later philosophy, and has been the central
concern of the work of Alan Blum and Peter McHugh. The issues and spectres raised by reflexivity are methodological arbitrariness, the need to take responsibility for one’s own talk
(and the cultural assumptions embedded in talk) and, finally, the deep fear of nihilism – the
sense that with regard to inquiry (along with everything else in the world) nothing matters.
As such, reflexivity raises the most fundamental issue that can be raised for modern social
inquiry. Through an oriented interpretation of the work of Blum and McHugh and other contemporary social theorists (particularly Gadamer and Arendt), this paper works through what
a dialectical engagement with these issues look like.

Key words: Arendt, Blum and McHugh, ethnomethodology, Gadamer, hermeneutics, modernity, nihilism, phenomenology, reflexivity

Part 1 – The Problem of Reflexivity
Reflexivity, Sociology and the Limits of Human Inquiry
The problem of reflexivity for sociology concerns the ability of the inquirer
to take responsibility for what one says while simultaneously being able to
say something substantial about the phenomenon or object of inquiry. This
issue of reflexivity is both particular and general. General, as it points to the
limit of human inquiry itself and is a problem facing all inquiry, whether philosophical, humanistic, or scientific: it pervades concerns with theory, epistemology, methodology, ontology, all of which are always bound up with any
and every instance of practical research. It is also particular to sociology in
so far as this capacity is central to social action and therefore constitutes the

<-----Page 1----->268

very subject matter of sociology. As an issue and with different levels of
emphasis, it is taken seriously by various strands of the interpretive traditions
in sociology, including the Symbolic Interactionism of Blumer (1969) and
followers, the phenomenology of Berger and his associates (e.g., 1963, 1964,
1974), the ethnomethodology of Garfinkel (1967) and his followers (see
Turner, 1974), as well as the Analytic Theory of Blum & McHugh and their
students. Other traditions like the structuration theory of Giddens, the NeoStructuralism of Alexander, the critical theory of Habermas (1988) and various streams of feminist thought (Lather, 1991; Scott, 1990; Smith, 1987) in
different ways seek to integrate the insights developed in the interpretive tradition into their own frameworks (see Ritzer, 1996, pp. 351–484; Wallace and
Wolf, 1991 for a summary). While the topic of reflexivity is very current (e.g.,
Beck, Giddens and Lash, 1994; Bourdieau and Wacquant, 1992) the problem
of the danger of ‘vortex’ (to use Giddens’ terminology) does not occupy the
mainstage of contemporary sociology, as it could be argued it did in the 1970s;
it is, nonetheless, one that is intrinsic to the enterprise of sociology. And, as
Sharrock and Anderson (1986) say about ethnomethodology, just because the
problems raised by a reflexive sociology are not fashionable does not mean
that they have been dealt with.
Weber’s (1947, p. 88) famous definitions of sociology and social action
make the question of reflexivity central to the sociological method and constitutive of the discipline itself. Sociology, he says, concerns “the interpretive
understanding of social action” and social action is behaviour which, because
“of the subjective meaning attached to it by the acting individual (or individuals), it takes into account the behaviour of others and is thereby oriented in its
course.”1 “On this view,” as the Collins Dictionary of Sociology states (1995,
p. 550), “reflexivity is a capacity possessed by social actors which is decisive
in distinguishing human actors from animals.” Thus, Weber passes on to sociology the problem of how adequately to take into account an acting individual whose own action is predicated on the subjective meaning the actor
attaches to it. As McHugh et al. (1974) put it in their Motive paper, the Weberian
legacy concerns the issue of formulating behaviour which itself is oriented to
the very same environment it constitutes. The member is reflexive insofar as
his or her action is oriented by taking into account the behaviour of others.
The sociologist, whose task it is to interpret this action, needs to reflect both
on the member’s reflexivity and on his/her own reflexivity.
In Webster’s dictionary, the etymological root of the word ‘reflex’ means
to bend back and its meaning resonates with a bending back or turning back
on oneself. For example, the sentences, ‘I surprised myself,’ or ‘I thought to
myself’ are reflexive sentences because the subject and object of the sentence
are the same person. Even at this early stage in recognising the linguistic
possibility of reflexivity, a possibility which for Mead (1934) is what constitutes the self as social, as both an ‘I’ and a ‘me,’ we can also sense a danger

<-----Page 2----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

269

of making reflexivity a central focus. It not only risks an excessive self-absorption on the part of the inquirer but also risks getting caught up in a vicious and endless circle. This very real danger leads many to the conclusion
that trying to deal with the problem of reflexivity is like trying to stand back
from one’s shadow. Adequately dealing with the problem of reflexivity, from
this point of view, is beyond the limits of human capacity; it is, fundamentally,
an impossible problem – we can reflect on the human capacity for reflection,
and reflect on our reflection of the capacity for reflection, and reflect on our
reflection of our reflection on the human capacity for reflection, and so on.
The issue of reflexivity opens up a Pandora’s Box of issues which, on the
surface, seems to make it either narcissistic or foolhardy to confront this problem directly. It is this danger which led Giddens (1976, p. 166) to the mocking
conclusion that Blum and McHugh and their colleagues are “intrepid travellers
all, now left swirling helplessly in the vortex of the hermeneutic whirlpool.” Yet,
there is a cost to ignoring this issue; it lies at the very core of sociology and
pervades and threatens to undermine the analytic integrity of its claims. Thus,
as Heidegger (1967, pp. 3–4) says of the Thales story, ‘swirling helplessly’ is
what those who undertake to address this important problem risk.2
In this paper I will address the work of Blum and McHugh in light of this
issue of reflexivity. Along the way I will show what their perspective shares
with, and how it differs from, other perspectives – in sociology in particular (e.g., ethnomethodology) and in contemporary interpretive theory (e.g.,
poststructuralism, hermeneutics) in general. This paper is not a description
of the work of Blum and McHugh, nor is it a response to their critics. Rather,
I am going to read their work as my way of working through this issue. That
is to say, I read their work as, in Gadamer’s (1975, pp. 325–341) terms, an
answer to a question. This requires a dialogical engagement with their texts
and the sociological tradition in order to recover the question to which that
dialogue (i.e., the dialogue between the Analysis and the sociological tradition) is an answer to. Thus, and in the spirit of Analysis (sometimes called
Analytic Theory and which I [1997] have called dialectical analysis), this paper
is my way of working out the problem of reflexivity as I work through their
solution to this problem. The paper is an example or icon of what coming to
terms with the problem of reflexivity looks like and so tries to do what it says
both Analysis and Gadamer’s hermeneutics are trying to do.
Blum and McHugh are most often treated as sociologists who aim to push
further the reflexive developments initiated by ethnomethodology. Sharrock
and Anderson (1986, p. 110), for example, say that they “show some comprehension of and sensitivity to the concerns” of ethnomethodology and as
such “are aware of places at which it is vulnerable.” Analysis, Sharrock and
Anderson say (p. 111), understands ethnomethodology as “misrepresenting as
theoretical and empirical problems, what are in fact problems of community and
authority, of seeking sounder sociological investigations when what is needed

<-----Page 3----->270

KIERAN BONNER

is a reconstruction of a whole form of intellectual life, of pursuing methodological objectives when an authentic relation with others should be sought.” In
describing Analysis in this way, Sharrock and Anderson remark that this attempt
to push the “examination of the assumptions” of one’s own inquiry to the roots
is more radical than ethnomethodology’s expression in this enterprise.
As well as showing a recognition of the intellectual influences on Blum and
McHugh (in particular, ethnomethodology and Heidegger’s hermeneutical
transformation of Husserl’s phenomenology), Sharrock and Anderson also
show an understanding of the focus of Analysis. For Analysis, the examination of the assumptions of one’s own inquiry (reflexivity) requires that one
deal with problems of community and authority as against just theory and empiricism, reconstruct intellectual life as against just seek sounder sociological investigations, and seek an authentic relation with others as against pursue
methodological objectives. To anyone familiar with the writing corpus of Blum
and McHugh, this description resonates with what Analysis is about.
Yet, it raises as many questions as it answers. Is there something about
modern sociological investigations which requires the reconstruction of intellectual life? What does social inquiry have to do with community and authority or with an authentic relationship with others? Are these not substantive
and practical concerns rather than matters concerning the place of reflexivity
in social inquiry? What does understanding the way acting individuals take
their own action into account have to do with community, authority or authentic
relationship with others? It seems that the problem of reflexivity is as much a
matter of practice (community, authority, authentic relationship, and reconstructing intellectual life) as it is of theory.
This paper will show that the problem of reflexivity, inherited from Weber’s very conception of sociology, is transformed by phenomenological and
ethnomethodological developments in sociology. To demonstrate, I will take
up the everyday example of motive talk and Blum and McHugh’s analysis
of this practice. The influence of the linguistic turn of hermeneutics and
Wittgenstein’s (1958) later philosophy enables another transformation in the
understanding of what is involved in taking responsibility for our own talk,
bringing to the fore the issue of nihilism. The paper argues that by taking into
account the problem of nihilism, we can gain a better understanding of the
work of Blum and McHugh and, more importantly, understanding the developments in dialectical analysis can help to recognise and understand the significant problem of nihilism.
Reflexivity as methodological arbitrariness: motive talk
As stated, the problem of reflexivity is intrinsic to the being of sociology, as
this has been articulated by Weber’s concept of Verstehen. Essential to the act

<-----Page 4----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

271

of understanding social action involves understanding the self-understanding
of social actors because the self-understanding of social actors constitutes
action as social in the first place. Motive talk is one example of the way ordinary people go about making sense of their environment. Weber (1947, p. 98)
defines motive as follows: “A motive is a complex of subjective meaning which
seems to the actor himself or to the observer an adequate ground for the conduct in question.” (This fits with his earlier definition of social action.)
Webster’s, (1975) dictionary defines motive as “something (as a need or desire) that causes a person to act.” If motive talk is an omni-relevant feature
(see any daily newspaper) of the way ordinary social actors understand each
others actions – whether it be doing greetings, raising children, organizing
famine relief or the pope’s visit to Cuba – then to understand this discourse is
to understand a paradigmatic example of the reflective practices of social
actors.
While acknowledging that ordinary social actors do motive talk as a way
of making sense of actions, scientists and theorists of science like Abel (1977)
and Rudner (1977) argue that such a procedure could not be relied upon by
sociologists because it depended too much on the “personal experience and
introspective capacity” of the sociologist.” (Dallmayr & McCarthy, 1977, p.
79) For example, in order to understand what is going on inside of Castro’s
mind to account for his invitation of the pope to Cuba, observers have to rely
on their introspective capacity. This reliance has two problems. Because the
observer sociologist needs to recreate “psychological states” (Rudner) in order to make the “observed behaviour comprehensible” (Dallmayr & McCarthy,
p. 79), the discipline of sociology becomes dependent on psychology (and the
way the science of psychology provides verified knowledge about motivational
states). More importantly, this procedure introduces a sense of arbitrariness
concerning the connection between the behaviour and the ascribed motivational state. How can we know for sure what is going on inside of another
person’s head? We ask them, but do people know their own motivations?
Drawing on the resources of empathy and sympathy, as Weber (1947, pp. 88–
115) suggests we do, can help the sociologist imagine what is going on. But,
again, this also seems arbitrary.
Initially then, Weber’s idea of Verstehen was commonly accepted to mean
that sociologists make use of “personal experience” and the capacity for “introspection” as a way of getting inside peoples heads.3 The problem with this
idea of reflexivity, is that it renders the sociologist’s account arbitrary, an
account as much imposed by the sociologist as belonging to what the sociologist is talking about. “So,” argues Abel, “introspective capacity . . . could
not be a method of verification” but, at best, a heuristic “aid in preliminary
explorations of a subject.” (p. 79). Reflexivity may aid in speculating about
and exploring a subject but it could not be relied upon to produce knowledge
of the subject. In the last analysis, the probability of a connection between

<-----Page 5----->272

KIERAN BONNER

the action and the source of its impulse can be established only by means of
“objective, experimental, and statistical tests” (Dallmayr & McCarthy, p. 79).
This formulation of motive follows the conventional positivistic tradition.
That is, motives are conceived “as private internal characteristics of persons
which impinge upon and coerce these persons into various behaviours. In this
view, motives are seen simultaneously (1) as ‘causal’ antecedent variables . . .,
and (2) as characteristic of ‘states’ of persons engaging in behaviour” (McHugh
et al., 1974, p. 33). For example, Castro’s motive is seen as going on in
his mind and as a cause for the action of inviting the pope to Cuba. When
Maclean’s (January 19, 1998, p. 41) magazine says that Castro’s motive for
inviting the pope is to “help to counter American efforts to isolate Cuba,” such
an explanation may be an adequate ground for the ordinary person but it cannot be treated as reliable sociological knowledge.
Under the influence of phenomenology, Alfred Schutz was the first to challenge this reading of Weber’s Verstehen. Schutz critiques the positivist interpretation of Weber and the positivist understanding of reflexivity as introspection
because it excludes much of social life from sociological investigation (Schutz,
1977, p. 229). Reflexivity, he says (p. 220), “involves neither mere observation of external behaviour, nor private introspection, nor a process of psychic
identification.” Rather, as a method peculiar to the human sciences, it refers
to the what Husserl calls the Lebenswelt, or the life-world, “within which all
scientific and even logical concepts originate.” This is to say “that any knowledge of the world, in common sense thinking and in science, involves mental
constructs, syntheses, generalizations, formulations, idealizations, specific to
the level of the thought organization.” (Schutz, p. 232) This kind of knowledge forms the basis of the life-world and is taken-for-granted by both common sense and science.
The “Motive” paper examines motive from this life-world perspective. Thus,
motive talk is treated as (to use a Foucauldian term) a discursive practice.
When competent everyday actors engage in motive talk they are following
very precise communal rules about what is to count as adequate motive talk.
So we would not expect to read in Macleans some reporter speculating that
Castro invited the pope to Cuba because he (Castro or the pope) had a sore
leg; such a speculation would invite us to question the competence of the reporter because it would show that he or she did not seem to understand what
is involved in doing adequate motive talk. In the idiom of Blum and McHugh
(1974) motives are not a stimulus going on in somebody’s head but rather show
members formulating themselves and their environment. In order to be able
to do this kind of formulating and to demonstrate to each other that we are
able to do this, we, as competent everyday members of society, are required
to follow specific rules and grammar.
Life-world theorizing, both done and taken-for-granted by ordinary actors,
provides the substance that positivism both investigates and also takes for

<-----Page 6----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

273

granted. The “Motive” paper (McHugh et al., 1974) argues, that in accepting
motive as a ‘causal’ antecedent variable characteristic of a person’s internal
psychic state, social scientists take on the very assumptions of the everyday
life-world that need to be examined. The very reasonability and intelligibility
of motive talk, the fact that there are very specific rules for doing the practice
of motive talk, which, in turn, provide a sense of a world composed of people
whose actions are understood in terms of their motive, are all taken for granted
in the positivist understanding.
Thus, the “social life-world” (see Berger et al., 1973, p. 63 for a description of this notion) is the starting point of all investigations, a starting point
which is both unacknowledged and required by science, natural and social,
because (as ethnomethodology has shown in many detailed ways) it is the
social life-world which provides for a world to be investigated in the very first
place. Motive talk is an instance of an ordinary member’s reflexive practice,
a practice which provides for a world of persons (e.g., Castro) who are formulated as owning their experiences (e.g., a history of opposing the U.S.)
which, in turn, is seen as providing the ground or grammar for connecting
events (inviting the pope) with available designations (counteracting). In short
form, what life-world analysis demonstrates is that everything known requires
a knower and that knowledge is the product of a transaction between a knower
and a known. “What mediates between a knower and a known, then, is a perspective, and knowledge is always coloured by that perspective.” (Littlejohn,
1989, p. 9).4
It is now clear that, far from introducing a methodological arbitrariness into
sociology (as positivists like Abel and Rudner argue), reflexivity must be part
of a rigorous social analysis. If any social scientist excludes from examination the way the social life-world structures how a phenomenon is recognised
in the first place, he or she unreflectively takes on the taken-for-granted assumptions of the everyday member precisely when these are what need to be
examined. From the perspective of the recognition of the shaping power of
the Lebenswelt, it would be fundamentally incomplete for a sociologist not to
make reflexivity an essential component of social analysis. This recognition,
therefore, is the first step in taking responsibility for what one says while simultaneously establishing knowledge about the ordinary practices of everyday members. Would it not be irresponsible if the sociologist were now to
ignore the reflexive practices of the ordinary social actor, practices which
themselves constitute the world which all social scientists investigate?
Reflexivity, practical accounts and the responsibility of the inquirer
When the “Motive” paper was reprinted in the book On the Beginning of Social
Inquiry, an “Addendum” was added, where Blum, McHugh and their collabo-

<-----Page 7----->274

KIERAN BONNER

rators Raffel and Foss, point to the limitations of this version of reflexivity.
They say that despite the epistemological advance which phenomenology
represents on conventional social science, their analysis is not self-reflective
enough because they exempt their own talk about motive from a rigorous reflexive examination. They critique themselves for not examining the inquirer’s interest in accounting for the self-reflective practices of the member. Thus,
they say, a more fundamental question remains to be asked: “What kind of
world would make motive talk intelligible and interesting?” That is, a more
comprehensive and stronger version of reflexivity should include the requirement that (1974, p. 44) “we address our own interest in motive talk, that we
address the fact that we find such talk interesting.” Their interest in reflexivity is now being pushed to another level and includes another kind of “bending back.” At this level, the inquirer asks after the inquirer’s own interest in
accounting for the reflexive practices of the member. While their description
of members’ practices (e.g., motive talk) are more adequate and complete than
the discourse which operates from within a positivistic epistemology, they do
not account for why this should be done in the first place. (Are we now peering into the “hermeneutic vortex” again?).
In specifying their self-critique, they say (p. 44), motive is interesting because it “represents an occasion of collectability” and so the interest in
collectability needs to be theorized. That is, the very idea of motive can be
interpreted as an everyday attempt to provide for a reasonable world. To use
the language of their later work, it is a solution to the problem of the need and
desire to live in a reasonable world. Yet, this problem was not theorized by
them. The problem with the “Motive” paper, they now say, is that the interest
in the talk is conflated with the member’s interest but that interest is not addressed or critically examined.5 The issue here is that while motive talk collects and therefore appears to make sense of various instances of behaviour,
is such sense-making deeply reasonable? Might not motive talk, as an example of finding a cause (e.g., Castro’s need to counter the American embargo),
be as much an attempt to bring thinking and theorizing to an end as it is to do
theorizing. Just because members, through the doing of competent motive talk,
reasonably collect the invitation by Castro with (the reason of) his interest in
counteracting the American economic embargo – and through such theorizing constitute a world of ‘types of persons’ with biographies such persons are
said to own, and so on, – just because theorizing is done in this way does not
make such theorizing deeply reasonable.
The bending back of reflexivity now raises a deeper, a more problematic,
and a more fundamental problem, that is, the very idea of reasonability itself.
Can the reasonability of the inquirer’s theorizing be provided for as the theorist seeks to understand the reasonability of the phenomenon being addressed?
The idea of inquirers taking responsibility for their own talk now involves reflecting on the socio-historical situation which privileges some forms of in-

<-----Page 8----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

275

quiry over others. For example, if the idea of cause connotes a powerful but
dumb force (e.g., the law of gravity), is it deeply reasonable to be fascinated
with a powerful but dumb force? – to be satisfied with a world (McHugh et
al., p. 45) “where there is a continual process of clarifying the things one is
with by making reference to things outside of them (things that are before,
after, or external)”? What does this say about us as social inquirers if this is
what dominates our theorizing? Of course, in calling into question the deep
reasonability of an inquiry which seeks to find the causes of action, they are
calling into question the reasonability of science itself as a form of life. And,
in doing that, one is simultaneously calling into question the modern lifeworld which gives such a version of theorizing the appearance of eminent
reasonability.
It is interesting to think of a similar development Gadamer makes in
Truth and Method, which was translated into English around the same time.
Gadamer’s (1975) notion of “effective history” makes the same general point
of the process of understanding. Gadamer’s idea (1975, p. xix) that “understanding is never subjective behaviour toward a ‘given object,’ but towards
its effective history – the history of its influence; in other words, understanding belongs to the being of that which is understood.” A perspective (e.g., science) is not just conceptual (Gadamer, pp. 5–39) but is also existential in that
it reveals a way of action and a way of life, that is, a way of being in the world.
This means that “observation, reason and understanding are never objectively
pure; they are always coloured by history and community” (Littlejohn, p. 140).
Blum and McHugh, in a more aggressive and polemical (should I say – more
American?) way, are now raising the issue of science’s way of being in the
world. They push the problem of reflexivity to the need to question the conventions which support the scientific mode of inquiry. They ask, are these conventions, these assumptions worth agreeing with?
It is at this point in my narrative that the need to go behind their texts becomes an issue.6 What deep question moves the Analysis project to raise these
concerns? The deep question animating the rigorous pursuit of the problem
of reflexivity in social inquiry is, I suggest, the problem of nihilism. In the
“Introduction” to the 1974 book, McHugh et al. specifically address the issue
of the adequacy of inquiry by reflecting on the adequacy of their own inquiry.
They say (3): “In speaking we are denying that we are doing an inadequate
activity. Otherwise our speech would be no different that chatter, than silence,
than what Rosen calls nihilism.” What if the world of science, though it may
be epistemologically consistent, is a feature of and contribution to the sense
that nothing, neither talk nor action, makes a real difference? This very discursive move (questioning the conventions which support modern inquiry)
may seem to put Analysis outside of sociology (insofar as the latter understands itself as a science); yet, it has a continuity with the questions Weber
(1946) first raised in “Science as a Vocation,” questions that pervade much of

<-----Page 9----->276

KIERAN BONNER

Weber’s work, especially his famous Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1958). That is, what can sociology offer to the Tolstoyian questions,
“What should we do?” and “How should we live?” Weber recognizes that
the role of science is limited to clarifying the goals and purposes one has
already, but is not able to otherwise substantively contribute to the issue of
the good. And this, according to Weber, is the fate the scientist must bear.
Yet, can clarity be conceived as an ultimate purpose and how can this be
provided for?
Part 2 – Reflexivity and the Problem of Nihilism
The Problem of Nihilism
The interest in pursuing the problem of reflexivity is (I interpret) a response
to a deep concern with the question of nihilism.7 This theme is noted passingly
in the Dallmayr (1988) and Roche (1988) reviews of Self-Reflection in the Arts
and Sciences and it helps us understand why in that book (1984, pp. 138–139),
the actions of Camus’ Meursault are taken to be “a good example” of the problem of modern theory. They quote Meursault as follows: “Nothing, nothing
had the least importance . . . all the ideas that people had tried to foist on me.
. . . What difference could they make to me.” What is interesting about this
statement taken from fictional literature is that it mirrors a very similar question Dallmayr and McCarthy (1977, p. 1) ask in another context:
While man’s empirical knowledge in our century has expanded at an exponential rate, however, his sense of purpose or direction seems to have
atrophied: although more knowledgeable about the world than any of his
forebears, man today is more ignorant or at a loss as to what he and his accumulated knowledge are all about. Confronted with a rationally functioning but ultimately silent universe, he asks the question: what is the point?
Viewed in this context, contemporary methodological issues reveal their
salience and underlying agony: the concern with ‘understanding’ as a type
of inquiry results from a crisis of human understanding.
The question and problem of developing an inquiry which can take responsibility for what it says while saying something substantial about the world has
now deepened. In order to take responsibility for one’s inquiry, one must be
able to give a sense of its purpose or point. To claim that it is a more rigorous
account of members’ accounting practices than positivistic sociology (as
ethnomethodology does), merely raises the question of the purpose of accounting for the rigorous accounting of members accounting practices. In other
words, inquirers need to show a taking of responsibility for their own practice of inquiry, a responsibility which involves, at some point, raising the issue of point or purpose. To fail to raise such a question is to fail to live up to

<-----Page 10----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

277

the demand inherent in the notion of reflexivity, a demand that now means
addressing the issue that “nothing, nothing has the least importance.”
Meursault embodies the spirit of an age which, though it has greater empirical knowledge than any age previous to this, is, in the words of Dallmayr
and McCarthy, more “at a loss as to what this knowledge is all about.” Nihilism, as embodied by Meursault, is the positive embrace of the recognition of
a universe which is “rationally functioning but ultimately silent.” Nihilism
embraces futility and treats such an embrace as strong insofar as it has the
courage to face the recognition of the pointlessness of the universe. We are
now beginning to glimpse why questions of sound sociological investigations
require the reconstruction of social life and why questions of sociological
procedure connect with questions of authenticity. They do so when the attention to reflexivity demanded of all social inquiry by phenomenology is reflexively turned on the one who would put forward this demand.
This focus adds an ethical and political element to what should, from a
framework which accepts the epistemological implications of science, be
narrowly theoretic and methodological. And while such a development
muddies the identity of sociology, that is, its conventional place as one more
discipline among many (with its own intellectual territory mapped out), selfreflexive integrity means that such boundaries can no longer be passively
accepted. But, as Sharrock and Anderson say about the impulse which sustains ethnomethodology, to now ignore these questions would be an act of bad
faith, a denial of scholarly standards and reflexive integrity. Of course, to put
the whole tradition of sociology to question does not, as some have suggested,
have to mean that one has put oneself outside the discipline. Rather, I argue,
it expands the parameters of the discipline in the same way as asking what
does it mean to be human expands the parameters of humanity. Again, this
development in Analysis mirrors the “extension of hermeneutic procedures
to the domain of social inquiry” which also involves “a rethinking of accepted
[disciplinary] boundaries.” (Dallmayr and McCarthy, 1977, p. 285).
Reflexivity, science and morality
If nihilism is the deep question raised by Analysis, in what way can their texts
now be interpreted as responses to this question? In On The Beginning of Social
Inquiry, McHugh et al. (1974) examine various cultural practices like Snubs,
Bias, Travel and bring to the fore the tensions and negations revealed and
concealed by those practices while simultaneously showing (and taking responsibility for) the grounds which makes their own analysis possible. In their
own words, to do analysis is to serve as a reminder “of the ways in which the
conventions of ordinary thought have become segregated from their grammatical grounds” (McHugh et al., p. 11). Analysts question the worth of standing

<-----Page 11----->278

KIERAN BONNER

or holding onto such grounds while simultaneously calling attention to the
grounds which make their own analysis possible.
For example, the “Bias” paper (drawing on the influence of Wittgenstein)
shows that the practice of finding bias is a specific move in a language game,
in particular, the language game (or life-world) of science. However, from
within the perspective of the (taken for granted) positivist life-world, bias is
thought of as a particular and identifiable thing which flaws research, a thing
which, it follows, should be eliminated in order for the research to be acceptable. In turn, the criteria of validity and reliability are the socially sanctioned
ways to ensure the elimination of bias from practical sociological research.
The question is: what are the epistemological and cultural assumptions that
are embedded in and ground this intellectual practice?
To invoke bias is to name a trouble, because, from within the life-world of
science, speech and knowledge are assumed to be about a world which is independent of knowers. The self-understanding of science is that its own speech
is a thing which copies nature. Ideal speech is therefore anonymous speech,
the speech of any person. The “intelligibility of bias as a charge or accusation
makes necessary reference to the rule which the charge violates, and the rule
in this case is a notion of objectivity which is itself grounded in an ideal of
communality and of impersonal speech.” (p. 56). Because the reality of the
world is assumed to exist independently of mind, of language, or of the
knower, bias as a thing is identifiable because the speakers or knowers can
be identified in what they say? “To see bias” therefore, “is to see the purported inquiry as more intelligible by making reference to the contingent
personal position of the inquirer than to the nature of the objects he claims
to describe.” (p. 59).
Bias, therefore, is a charge that the knower did not overcome self-interest, by transforming what he or she knows into that which anybody could
know. By virtue of that inability or unwillingness, the claims of the knower
will not be accepted by the community of scientists. The charge of bias, is
a rule-guided charge ground in the theoretic community of science with a
grammar of the unnecessarily private. It is seen as a public claim which is
actually based on a private interest that could not be shaken off. Thus, as is
pointed out, the charge of bias has moral overtones and it demonstrates that
the scientific orientation not only references conformity to a certain epistemology but also, more deeply, references an ontology, i.e., a moral community. Thus, as with every other form of inquiry, the observation of a problematic
bias in research shows that “observation, reason and understanding are never
objectively pure; they are always coloured by history and community.”
(Littlejohn, p. 140).
To summarize, as a move in a language game, there are certain rules which
have to be followed if the process of finding bias is to be recognised as the
normative intelligible activity it is. The process of identifying bias in a speech

<-----Page 12----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

279

is no longer seen as merely conforming to an epistemology for correctly producing knowledge but also as a cultural practice. Reflexive analysis requires
analyzing the relevant (culturally and historically specific) life-world (in this
case, modern science) of the phenomenon (Bias) being investigated. Yet, given
that all knowledge production (including Analysis and hermeneutics) is ground
in cultural practices what is the particular problem with the positivist lifeworld?
The problem with the positivist mode of inquiry is the way the ontological
implications and the moral claims it carries are concealed by the attempt of
the epistemology to treat its own claims as neutral and objective. The further
problem with this orientation (as George Grant, Hannah Arendt and Gadamer
have, in their different ways, also brought to light) is that by requiring that
inquirers treat themselves as messengers and neutral instruments, the very question of the authority for the speech and its appearance as a socio-historical action is rendered invisible. Science, as a community, requires a commitment to
the apparent non-commitment of method and then it treats that commitment as
though it were not a commitment at all.
Scientific method is now understood as an oriented (if unreflective) avoidance of taking responsibility for one’s own talk, an avoidance which can only
be sustained by an unwillingness to face the contradictions embedded in one’s
inquiry.8 Thus, it is not an accident that the scientific life-world makes a concern with reflexivity appear both unproductive and (if we accept the revolution brought about by the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism) morally
irresponsible. From the scientific life-world, self-reflective analysis appears
as unnecessarily self-aggrandizing, compared with the acceptance of “an effacement of self in the search for understanding” (Berger, 1963, p. 166) required by scientific methodology. Yet, the irony is that the self-effacement
required by science is actually a concealing from awareness, of the way its
own procedures influence the production of the truth, by making its conclusions seem like a neutral description of what is. McHugh et al. conclude (p.
75), that their analysis seeks to draw attention of others away “from a [narrow] concern with facts and details to which the talk [of science] is oriented
– the question of practical decisions and constraints – to a concern with the
commitments underlying all speech and with their rational and moral status.
We have tried to make the commitment underlying biased speech show itself
intelligibly as a concern to protect this very question (the question of commitment) from being explored. In this sense we have asked whether such a
life is worth living, whether such a world is worth our commitment, and we
have brought an alternative world to view.”
The correlation of the advance in scientific knowledge and the atrophying
of a sense of purpose (noted by Dallmayr and McCarthy, 1977, p. 1) is now
not sheerly coincidental. Science and the enlightenment ideal which supports
and promotes science, protects the question of commitment from being ex-

<-----Page 13----->280

KIERAN BONNER

plored – including and especially its own commitment to impersonal speech.
The lack of oriented reflexivity, which is a crucial feature of the empirical
method, is now not just itself methodologically arbitrary (with regard to the
study of social life): it contributes to the ongoing deferral of questions of
purpose and point. Thus the enlightenment prejudice against prejudice
(Gadamer, 1975, pp. 241–253) or the scientific bias against bias, while useful in establishing precise empirical knowledge, has dangerous political and
ethical implications. Given the spread of Western science in this age of globalization, such political and ethical dangers are now more pressing.
Science and Nihilism
After the influence of the post-structuralism of Foucault and Derrida, the
hermeneutics of Gadamer and contemporary post-structuralist feminisms (e.g.,
Lather, 1991; Scott, 1990), it is now more plausible to understand science as
a kind of moral community, even though that violates science’s own self-understanding (as neutral and detached); it also sounds less extreme to say that
resisting the dominance of positivism involves one not only in epistemological battles but also in ontological battles. As Lather (1991, p. 14) states, “contemporary history and philosophy of science, sociology of knowledge, and
movement in science itself, all have combined to impress upon us the interdependence of method, theory and values.” The dominance of positivism,
which is now struggling to deal with the onslaught of the post-modern critique (Lather, pp. 102–122), was much more pervasive, and pervasively accepted in the early 1970s. Remembering Gadamer’s claim that understanding
is necessarily intertwined with history and community and now with the benefit of the superiority of subsequent understanding, we can recognize why
some of the writing in On the Beginning of Social Inquiry polemically overstates in an either/or way the line in the sand between science and Analytic
Theory.
As stated, Blum, McHugh and colleagues’ pursuit of the issues surrounding reflexivity can be usefully interpreted as struggling with the problem of
nihilism. They are not alone in their concern here. “The elimination of the idea
of final purpose from the scientific study of the human and non-human things”
according to George Grant (1969, pp. 37–40) “not only led to the progress of
science and the improvement of conditions but also had consequences on the
public understanding of what it was to live. . . . Consequently, the corrosions
of nihilism occur in all parts of the community. . . . For those who stay within
the central stream of our society and are therefore dominant in its institutions,
the effect of nihilism is the narrowing to an unmitigated reliance on technique.”
In going on to analyze the cultural interconnection between the modern university curriculum and modern technological society, modern theory has led,

<-----Page 14----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

281

he says (Grant, 1969, p. 131), to a tight circle: “The tight circle then in which
we live is this: our present forms of existence have sapped the ability to think
about the standards of excellence and yet at the same time have imposed on
us a standard in terms of which the human good is monolithically asserted.”
That one standard monolithically proclaimed is the desire to master human
and non-human nature. Such a mastery, furthered through scientific knowledge and technology, both assumes and defers the question: “what is the
point?”
Blum and McHugh, on the other hand, show that the tight circle is only
tight and vicious (and therefore the ground for pessimism and lament) when
one is not reflective with regard to what makes one’s own analysis possible.
Unlike other social inquirers addressing the same problems (e.g., Arendt,
Grant, Weber), Blum and McHugh’s work does not seem overwhelmed by the
pervasiveness and depth of the problem of modernity. Rather, they reflexively
acknowledge that the Language which allows for the life-world (language
game) of science also enables a dialectical resistance to the contradictions
inherent in that life-world, thus enabling a confident if even aggressive confrontation with a dominant modernity. If they show a confident confrontation
with the contradictions inherent in a dominant modernity, in what way can
this theoretic development be used to help address the spectre of nihilism?
The nihilism of Meursault does not defer but rather embraces the recognition that “nothing, nothing makes a difference.” Meursault can be appreciated
because of his apparent lack of ‘bad faith.’ When he says (1961, pp. 118–119)
“What difference could they make to me, the death of others, or a mother’s
love or his God; or the way one decides to live, the fate one thinks one chooses,
since one and the same fate was bound to ‘choose’ not only me but thousands
of millions of privileged people, who, like him, called themselves my brothers”- he is facing the only ‘point’ in life that humans can be certain about, our
mortality. This nihilism of Meursault is strong because, instead of fearfully
denying the increasing sense of pointlessness, he embraces the “privileged
equality” which his acknowledgement creates. “Every man alive was privileged; there was only one class of men, the privileged class. All alike would
be condemned to die one day.” We can recognise a display of honesty and
courage in his acknowledgement that “nothing, nothing had the least importance” even if we want to disagree with the acknowledgement.
Yet, openly “apprehending” and acknowledging “what is as chaos” (Grant,
1969, p. 38), assumes the worth of that apprehension and acknowledgment.
The raw, unironic honesty of nihilism does not take into account that, in speaking in this way, one’s actions show that something matters (e.g., the act of apprehending and acknowledging, the honesty and courage of facing a rationally
functioning but ultimately silent universe) while one is saying that “nothing
had the least importance.” Contemporary nihilism is a risk of those who think
deeply and honestly about our contemporary situation yet, in concluding that

<-----Page 15----->282

KIERAN BONNER

nothing matters, nihilism denies the thinking and honesty needed to come to
such a conclusion. An embrace of nihilism does not adequately account for
its own need to speak, to apprehend, to acknowledge. In this sense, nihilism
is self-contradictory. On the other hand, Analysis acknowledges (1974, p. 3)
that: “In speaking we are denying that we are doing an inadequate activity.
Otherwise our speech would be no different than chatter, than silence, than
what Rosen calls nihilism.”
Nihilism: The Risk of Reflexive Thinking
Much of what McHugh et al. say in the 1974 book exudes a sense of moral
superiority. In the “Bias” paper, they show that positivism has a shallow relation to the principles which authorize its knowledge-production. In “Travel”
they say: “The concretisation of self and consequent identification of coming
to know with an exchange of place presupposes a nihilistic actor as the paradigmatic social participant.” (McHugh et al., p. 153) In “Snubs” they show
how a snub denies the collaboration which a greeting invites but it needs to
collaborate in order to deny that collaboration. Thus, it too is self-contradictory. They conclude (p. 136): “The same form of life that is bothered by snubs
allows them to occur. Suffice it to say that it is possible to conceive of other
worlds.” That is, if one really understood snubs one would recognize that
they don’t and therefore should not hurt. Similarly, Lather arguing from a
postmodern feminist position (1991, p. 116) says that the problems of relativism “and its seeming attendant, nihilism” become a “non-issue” when it is
recognised that they are the “mirror twin of totalization in the ideologies of
objectivity.” Thus, showing the interrelation of theory and ethics, which both
postmodern feminism and Analysis do, enables the issue of nihilism to be
confronted and exposed rather than deferred.
However, the problem with this solution (i.e. a reflexivity which privileges
the superiority of theorizing and the inevitable and necessary recognition of
one’s own ethical and political standpoint) is that it appears as though the
examined life is not vulnerable or subject to the limits of social life and culture. Reflexive theorizing does not seem to have any life-world problem of
its own. Correspondingly, it seems that the life-world of positivism is trapped
in a demonic and un-redeeming unreflectiveness. In Gadamer’s terminology
(1975, p. 331), the dialectic of the 1974 book acknowledges the power of a
committed reflexivity but the latter does not appear as if it is itself subject to
the fundamental finitude of human understanding.
The 1984 book, Self-Reflection in the Arts and Sciences, can be read as a
response to some of these problems. In this book, self-reflection is now both
a topic and a problem. Developing a solution to the problem of self-reflection
is no longer a matter of showing the way practices and various social theories

<-----Page 16----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

283

are forgetful of, or in contradiction with, the grounds that make them possible. The 1974 stage affirms theorizing and through that affirmation shows how
the lack of reflexivity of science (everyday life, modernity) can be defeated
by its own self-contradiction; their 1984 work seeks to show the vulnerability of theorizing. If this is so, then the problem of nihilism developed here needs
revising. As I have argued here, the problem of nihilism, a problem which is
endemic to modern social theory, makes one self-conscious about the danger
that reasoning and analysis itself may be seen as pointless. Perhaps nihilism,
rather than being an interlocutor defeated by an oriented reflexivity (Analysis) or standpoint theory (feminism), is actually a feature and risk of a commitment to such inquiry. That is, is it a risk of the life committed to the
examination of life.
The key development in their 1984 work is that all theorizing, whether
everyday, scientific or classical, is seen as a solution to the problem of needing to speak reasonably about what cannot be captured by reason. The problem of taking responsibility for one’s own inquiry while simultaneously saying
something about the world, is now addressed of self-reflection itself. Theorizing is no longer the privileged and secure phenomenon which enables the
exposure of the contradictory commitments of others; rather, it is itself subject, it is itself a response to a need of sociality and simultaneously vulnerable to the very sociality to which it responds.
The question they themselves pose to the practice of self-reflection is: “is
there a reasonable basis in nature for responding to the unreasonable.” In other
words, can they, through an examination of contemporary social and sociological theory, find a way of reasonably speaking about things like point,
purpose, principle, or spirit in a way which is reflective about the point, purpose, principle, or spirit needed for this very enterprise. The concern of the
book is, intellectually and theoretically, not only to work through this problem but, in doing so, to be an exemplary display of what a reasonable relation
to spirit or principle would look like.
Nihilism, Analysis and Hermeneutics
At this stage, their work converges with Gadamer’s notion of the finitude of
human understanding. Their dialectical interest in engaging contemporary
social theory as if it were representative of different solutions to the deep need
for self-reflection mirrors Gadamer’s dialectical interest in requiring that we
see a text as if it were an answer to a question (1975, pp. 325–341). In both
cases, what is required of self-reflection is allowing of one’s thinking to enter
one’s understanding of the object, which is done by comprehending the way
we have comprehended the object. What Blum and McHugh are doing is
working out a solution to this now very deep problem, through an examina-

<-----Page 17----->284

KIERAN BONNER

tion of various solutions offered by classical and contemporary social theorists.
Yet, Gadamer’s hermeneutics, while intersecting with the Analysis project,
does not see the reflexive demand as so demanding. He argues that if we have
a lively relation to tradition, i.e., to all that is handed down through language,
then the phenomenon of nihilism need not be seen as so intractable. In the
Preface to Truth and Method (1975, p. xxiv), Gadamer acknowledges that “the
demand for a reflexive self-grounding, as made from the viewpoint of the
speculatively conducted transcendental philosophy of Fichte, Hegel and
Husserl is unfulfilled.” He then rhetorically asks “is the discourse with the
whole of . . . tradition in which we stand and which (as philosophers) we are,
purposeless? Do we need to justify what has always supported us?” That is,
the very tradition of philosophy makes reflexive self-grounding less urgent.
Gadamer (1992, pp. 111–123), in a later hermeneutic analysis of two pre-eminent German poets, Benn and Celan, acknowledges in the title of this essay
(“Under the Shadow of Nihilism”), that nihilism is a dominant twentieth-century worry. Yet, he does not see this issue as intertwined with reflexivity – perhaps because he theorizes out of a philosophical rather than a social science
discourse. Yet, from the vantage point of theorizing out of a human science
discourse, his appeal to tradition remains problematic.
Nihilism is a problem made urgent by a very specific relation to language,
history and community. It is very much a modern problem as it involves coming to terms with the energies released by the development of modernity from
the Reformation through to the Enlightenment, the industrial revolution and
the technological innovations of the twentieth century. Modernity, in turn, has
decisively shaped the formation and identity of the social sciences. (Arendt,
1958; Foucault, 1977; Grant, 1969) The social sciences, following the natural sciences, are defined by their break with tradition. Through recent developments in contemporary theory (feminism, poststructuralism and hermeneutics),
the humanities and natural sciences have been now shaped by this break with
tradition as well. Thus, the very being of the discipline of sociology, as one of
the social sciences, cannot as easily have recourse to reliance on tradition,9
because of our awareness (through the sociology of knowledge or genetic psychology, for example) that (Blum and McHugh, 1984, p. 26) “the rules for
accomplishing self-reflection seem to formulate self-reflection itself . . . as essentially particular and irrational.”
Therefore, rather than, like Gadamer, taking recourse in a tradition that the
social sciences have defined themselves as having broken with, is there now
not a need (1984, p. 38) to “provide an argument for the supposition that some
conventional needs are better (more rational) than others and hence that some
‘deep needs’ are good and not just arbitrary?” If the latter is true (and note
how uncomfortable we moderns feel with the bold and bald articulation of
the claim that “some conventional needs are better (more rational) than oth-

<-----Page 18----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

285

ers”), it is especially true of inquiry and so the issues of self-reflection and
nihilism demand to be dealt with again. (That old “hermeneutic vortex”
again!!!). Reflexivity, therefore, is a problem which exercises who we are at
this moment in history, that is, as modern social theorists who need to take
our own reasoning processes and its foundation seriously. I will now use this
development to re-engage the problem of nihilism.
A self-conscious nihilism is not a risk of the banal, of those who are not
inclined to reflect on social life. Whatever may be said about Eichmann, being an oriented nihilist was not one of them. Rather, Arendt (1978, p. 4) was
“struck by a manifest shallowness in the doer that made it impossible to trace
the uncontestable evil of his deeds to any deeper level of roots or motives.
. . . it was not stupidity but thoughtlessness.” To those caught up in the conventions of everyday thinking, nihilism appears to be an irrational or an elitist indulgence, much in the same way the Annette Benning character views
the Kevin Spacey character in the recent movie American Beauty. But it is not
merely the intellectual disease of those who are excessively self-absorbed or
the 1990s fad of adolescents who espouse anarchism. Neither is it merely the
self-interested fear of “Western, white male, class-privileged arrogance – if
we cannot know everything, then we can know nothing” (Lather, p. 116). Ironically, it is a temptation made real by the practice of self-reflection itself. As
Arendt (1978, pp. 176–177) acknowledges, “all critical examinations must go
through a stage of at least hypothetically negating accepted opinions and ‘values’ by searching out their implications and tacit assumptions. In this sense”
she goes on to say, “nihilism may be seen as an ever-present danger of thinking . . . [and] thinking is equally dangerous to all creeds.”
The only way to eliminate this danger of nihilism would be to eliminate
thinking from everyday life. On the other hand, and as Arendt (p. 177) has so
eloquently witnessed, “non-thinking, which seems so recommendable a state
for political and moral affairs, also has its perils. By shielding people from
the dangers of examination, it teaches them to hold fast to whatever the prescribed rules of conduct may be at a given time in a given society. What people then get used to is less the content of the rules . . . than the possession of
rules under which to subsume particulars. . . . I am alluding, of course, to what
happened in Nazi Germany and, to some extent in Stalinist Russia.”
The problem of nihilism is that it can neither be embraced nor avoided. To
avoid thinking is to get into the habit of forgetting the content of creeds and
rules and to be satisfied with their mere possession. If at any given time a
society is corrupt, then possessing the creeds or rules of that society will not
help anyone avoid doing evil. “When everybody is swept away unthinkingly
by what everybody else does and believes in, those who think are drawn out
of hiding because their refusal to join in is conspicuous and thereby becomes
a kind of action. . . . The manifestation of the wind of thought is not knowledge; it is the ability to tell right from wrong.” (pp. 192–193). However, “think-

<-----Page 19----->286

KIERAN BONNER

ing is equally dangerous to all creeds and, by itself, does not bring forth any
new creed.” A rejection of all creeds, as exemplified by Meursault, is the “everpresent danger of thinking.” The deep problem of nihilism is intertwined with
the deep need for thinking.
“Nihilism . . . is a perennial human danger: it cannot be ‘solved’ without
the dissolution of human nature.” (Rosen, 1969, p. xx) Rosen goes on to show
how much of contemporary philosophy, whether Heidegger’s ontology or
Wittgenstein’s ordinary language philosophy, has nihilistic roots. Rosen’s
“protective inoculation” against the otherwise “fatal results of this perennial
pestilence” involves pointing out that any claim for embracing the arbitrariness of ‘what is,’ must acknowledge the significance of making the claim and
thus stand in opposition to the content of the claim. Much (in thrust) like the
1974 stage of Analysis, the argument is that if nihilism is a risk of thinking,
protection from this risk is gained through rigorous reflexivity.
In the 1984 stage of Analysis however, Blum and McHugh’s (sometimes
tortuous) re-engagement of the problem of self-reflection flows from the
recognition that theorizing is not affirmed by merely pointing out the selfcontradictory nature of the claims of its enemies. Rather, precisely because
thinking and social life are inextricably intertwined, self-reflection must work
and work constantly to demonstrate its connection and its difference. The
intertwining is expressed by the claim that self-reflection is a moral enterprise.
As Dallmayr, in his (not uncritical) review of their 1984 work, remarks (1988,
p. 9) “perhaps the most significant strength of the study” is the “linkage of
reflection and ethics and the revalorization of moral excellence and virtue.”
In their presentation, he says (pp. 7–8), “principled action overcomes or sidesteps the dichotomy of rule-conformity and deviance – because ‘need’ is always particular and not subsumable under general rules, but without being
arbitrary. . . . In the context of both action and speech, the hallmark of selfreflection for Blum and McHugh resides in ‘irony’ or the ironic insinuation
of principle into discourse.” That is, theirs is a self-reflection which is “morally oriented” to the principle which grounds the inquirer’s reflection. ‘What
is,’ is conceived as Good, as ultimate truth or as Absolute, in order that the
discourse of self-reflection can work itself out in relation to the deep need for
self-reflection. The deep need for self-reflection is ironically insinuated into
discourse as an instance of the deep need of discourse “to comprehend what
is” as ultimate.
That the ultimate truth needs discourse and is absolute points to a source
of irony in my recognition that I am needed by the ultimate truth as much
as it is needed by me. In this recognition, irony differs first from those who
do not acknowledge the ultimate truth, and secondly those whose acknowledgement only concedes how they need the ultimate truth. In contrast, irony
enjoys its limit, it enjoys unfolding of the in-itself, because it enjoys being
needed and used by the ultimate truth (1984, p. 148).

<-----Page 20----->REFLEXIVITY AND INTERPRETIVE SOCIOLOGY

287

Self-reflexive inquiry (thinking) is not undertaken because it is strong and
grounded (though it is that too) but because it is needed. Without recognising
that inquiry participates in the mutual need (and desire) of discourse and the
ultimate truth for each other, humans end up being “confronted with a rationally functioning but ultimately silent universe.” In turn, the spectre of nihilism (“what is the point?”) haunts the age and inquiry. The “ironic insinuation
of principle into discourse,” recognises the mutuality of the need of the inquirer for discourse and the ultimate truth.
This Blum and McHugh solution to the problem of reflexivity can be contrasted with Gadamer’s notion of the finiteness of human knowledge. For
Gadamer, the experience of finiteness introduces a necessary negativity and
limit to the tendency of the human hope and desire to soar to unreasonable
conclusions. (1975, pp. 320–321) It provides a necessary antidote to the dangers of modern dogmatism and ideology. For Blum and McHugh, on the other
hand, need and desire ground the interest in theorizing in the first place. The
need and desire for discourse, as a need of the human condition, grounds the
commitment to reflexive inquiry. While, according to Gadamer, the danger
of an inquiry based on need and desire would be a tendency to dogmatism
rather than “reasonableness” (Gadamer, 1986) or phronesis – and some like
Roche (1988) and Wolf (1988) see this dogmatism expressed in the work of
Blum and McHugh – the danger of an inquiry based on awareness of the “experience of human finitude” (Gadamer, 1975, p. 320) may be a tendency to
dispiritedness. Both Analysis and hermeneutics can serve as antidotes to the
excessive tendencies of the other. (Bonner, 1997).
Again, in what way can we use these theoretical developments to address the
problem of nihilism. Meursault and others who raise the question of whether
anything matters (“what is the point?”) do not represent the true danger of nihilism: such questions call the inquirer to recognize the moment of nihilism that
is part of the commitment to thinking. Rather, the real danger of nihilism is those
who in ordinary and methodical ways seek to exclude the question of principle
from inquiry. “This is to say that what is unconditional about principle is that it
always raises the question of the relation between self and rule as a necessary
question. The principled actor questions (his own integration) unconditionally. His deepest failure would be to annihilate that question, whatever his
failures of competence, errors of interpretation or lowliness of spirit” (Blum
and McHugh, 1984, p. 137). The danger of nihilism, therefore, grows with the
annihilation of the question of principle from inquiry which, in this case, means
excluding reflexivity. Thus, the danger of nihilism may be represented by those
who are “the most respectable pillars of society, the least likely to indulge in
thoughts, dangerous or otherwise.” (Arendt, 1978, p. 177).
Blum and McHugh (Dallmayr, 1988, p. 9) are not alone in “the linkage of
reflection and ethics and the revalorization of moral excellence and virtue.”
Arendt (1958), Gadamer (1986), and Taylor (1991), among others, share this

<-----Page 21----->288

KIERAN BONNER

understanding and commitment. Yet, as Dallmayr (p. 9) points out, Blum and
McHugh:
emphasize an aspect of moral conduct which is perhaps understated in the
works of others: the fact that virtue requires not only reflectiveness (which
it does) but also frequently a good deal of tenacity, courage, and ‘spiritness,’
especially in the face of inner or outer obstacles and adverse conditions.
As portrayed in the [1984] study, such spiritedness derives again not merely
from an abstract ‘rule competence’ or familiarity with moral codes but rather
from a concrete learning process of moral seasoning in which reflection
and need (or desire) are peculiarly linked.
Dallmayr notes the peculiarity of the link between reflection and need and
desire. It is a peculiarity which both risks and confronts nihilism and a peculiarity which needs to be further engaged and specified. It is not as fully engaged as it needs to be because Blum and McHugh make reflexivity rather than
nihilism their topic.10 Yet, it is the argument of this paper that their explorations
of this topic help us understand one of the most fundamental issues that can be
raised for the theory and practice of modern life. And vice versa. Reflexivity,
at its core, is an ethical, political and pedagogical enterprise. The Analytic
perspective therefore, calls on social inquirers to raise the question of the worth
or excellence of the action being studied while simultaneously taking responsibility for the worth of asking such a question. It also reminds us of the “spirit”
needed for such an enterprise. Thus, to restate Sharrock and Anderson’s description (p. 111), “theoretical and empirical problems,” are also “in fact problems of community and authority,” sound investigations into social life require
an oriented reflexivity, and the pursuit “of methodological objectives” raise
issues of “authentic relation with others.” The Analytic element of all social
inquiry includes an examination of the ethical and political implications built
into assumptions while simultaneously raising for reflection the ethical and
political implications built into its own assumptions.
Notes
1. As is well established, Weber’s definitions are full of tensions in terms of their dual focus on both interpretive understanding and sociology as the scientific study of causes.
(See Dallmayr and McCarthy, 1977, pp. 19–74, for an elaboration of this tension and
debate.) These issues are not central to this paper, though the conclusions of the paper
provide one way to critically read Weber’s work.
2. Plato “tells the story of the Thracian peasant girl who bursts out laughing when she saw
Thales fall into a well while he was watching the motions of the heavenly bodies above
him, ‘declaring that he was eager to know the things in the sky, but what was . . . just at
his feet escaped him.’ And Plato adds: ‘Anyone who gives his life to philosophy is open
to such mockery. . . . The whole rabble will join the peasant girl in laughing at him . . .
[as] in his helplessness he looks like a fool” (Arendt, 1978, pp. 82–83). It seems that the

issue of reflexivity generates the kind of mockery which philosophy did in ancient Greece.
3. This acceptance was shared by both orthodox critics and advocates of Verstehen (see
Dallmayr and McCarthy, 1977, pp. 4–7, for a summary of these positions).
4. See Bonner (1997, pp. 71–104) for an evaluation of the discovery and interpretive positions with regard to the creation of knowledge.
5. In asking this kind of question, Analysis puts modern social inquiry up for question in so
far as they do not rely on the tradition of science to provide an answer to such a fundamental question. As Michael Brown (1988) says, they are engaged in a radical re-questioning of the tradition of sociology and, as such, show an inconoclastic characteristic. I
will return to this issue later but for now it can be pointed out that a serious grappling
with the problem of reflexivity means that one cannot rely on ways of doing research
which, though validated by convention, have not been subject to a radical questioning.
6. See Bonner (1994, 1998) for an elaboration and exemplification of the hermeneutic procedure of interpreting texts as answers to questions.
7. It is a theme in the Analysis project from On the Beginning of Social Inquiry (1974) to
Self-Reflection in the Arts and Sciences (1984) where, for example, Rosen’s book, Nihilism, is referred to in both the early and the later work.
8. This theme of responsibility has recently been addressed by Beck. “For Beck, responsibility is involved in the ‘insurance principle’ of simple modernity. In reflexive modernity the insurance principle no longer holds, as responsibility for dangers runs into spatial,
temporal and social unpredictability . . . What Beck means . . . is that the coalition of
business firms, policy makers and experts who create the dangers of contemporary society then construct a set of discourses of disavowal of such responsibility” (Lash, 1994,
p. 201). Blum and McHugh, on the other hand, demonstrate that disavowal of responsibility is not a Machiavellian move of self-protection but is intrinsic to the very practice
and method of science (see also Bonner, 1997, pp. 71–104).
9. Though, as both Gadamer notes and Blum and McHugh show (through their interpretation of the Socratic tradition of inquiry), the break with tradition is not as thorough and
complete as it is often portrayed.
10. In some ways their more recent work (e.g., Blum, 1991, 1994, 1996, 2001; McHugh, 1993,
1996), in different and individually independent ways, address the problem of the linkage between reflection and ethics in a world challenged by a concern with lost foundations. The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada has
recently sponsored a $2.5 million five-year project, led by Alan Blum, on the Culture of
Cities, Montreal, Toronto, Berlin, Dublin. It, too, addresses the former problem in relation to the tension between globalization and the city.
