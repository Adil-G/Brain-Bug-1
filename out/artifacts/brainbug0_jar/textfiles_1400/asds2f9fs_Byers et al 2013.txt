The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, selfperpetuating society of dis­
tin­guished scholars engaged in scientific
and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and
technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the author­ity of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy
has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal gov­ern­ment on
scientific and technical matters. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president of the
National Academy of Sciences.

The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National
Acad­e­my of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of
appropriate pro­fes­sions in the examination of policy matters pertaining
to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility
given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own
initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education.
Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg is president of the Institute of Medicine.

The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964,
under the charter of the Na­tion­al Academy of Sciences, as a parallel
organization of out­stand­ing engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National
Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal gov­ernment. The National Academy of En­gi­neer­ing also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of
engineers. Dr. Charles M. Vest is president of the National Academy
of Engineering.

The National Research Council was organized by the National
Academy of Sci­enc­es in 1916 to associate the broad community of
science and technology with the Academy’s purposes of fur­ther­ing
knowledge and advising the federal government. Func­
tion­
ing in
accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the
Council has become the principal operating agency of both the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the
scientific and en­gi­neer­ing communities. The Council is administered
jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Ralph J.
Cicerone and Dr. Charles M. Vest are chair­and vice chair, respectively, of the National Research Council.

Editor’s Note

Ronald M. Latanision

Note from Bridge Editor in Chief
Ronald M. Latanision
With this issue of the Bridge, the NAE will be in the
midst of a leadership transition as Dan Mote succeeds
Chuck Vest as president. I have had the opportunity
to work a bit with Dan in the context of an Association of American Universities (AAU) initiative on
precollege education that I chaired on behalf of the
AAU presidents. I look forward to working with him
once again. Chuck was president of MIT during my
time as a member of the faculty and while it is tempting
to mention Chuck’s reference to me as MIT’s “education czar,” I will resist. Instead, I might just mention
with fondness the bets that, as alums, we placed on the
Michigan–Ohio State football games: the bet included
the provision that the winner choose an artifact of the
winning school that the loser had to publicly display
on the MIT campus for some suitable period of time.
Unfortunately for me, he won most of those bets! I had
to carry a maize and blue umbrella around campus—
rain or shine. But on the one occasion when OSU did
win, he wore a Buckeye tie to a faculty meeting! These
were short interludes in Chuck’s characteristically
full agenda.
I also want to thank Guest Editor Diran Apelian for
his masterful work in assembling this issue of The Bridge
on the subject of undergraduate engineering education.
Education at every level has been important to me, personally and professionally, for a very long time. My roots
are in the coal mines of northeast Pennsylvania and the
educational system in this country has been at the core
of my life. I am concerned now that the intellectual

infrastructure in the United States is declining in many
of the engineering disciplines that are important to
this nation’s future. For example, metallurgists, ceramic
engineers, welding engineers, corrosion engineers, power
systems engineers, high-temperature oxidation experts,
cement chemists, and others are very difficult to find
among undergraduate and graduate students. We continue to build engineering systems that depend on these
disciplines, but the population of students and graduates
in such areas is declining. Part of the decline may in my
judgment be attributed to the declining research support
from agencies that typically fund university research in
the United States.
My years of university teaching and research convince me, in a reductionist sense, that most university
departments are subject to the following sequence:
(1) funding sources drive research, (2) research drives
the educational program at both the graduate and
undergraduate level, and (3) prospective students look
at the education (curriculum) that is offered and vote
with their feet in terms of their choice of major. This is
in itself not a startling observation. But I suspect that
engineering has taken a disproportionate hit in terms
of both research funding and student interest for some
time. This seems to be true in many engineering disciplines. What concerns me is that the nation’s university
research enterprise is out of balance in terms of both
funding distribution and direction.
Many would argue that the above engineering disciplines are mature and that there are higher priorities
for research support. It’s true that quite a lot is known
about the fundamentals in those disciplines, but without resources for research in a given area, why would a
department hire faculty with such interest? And without faculty, there are no students to follow that path of
research, and so the intellectual infrastructure that took
decades to develop begins to erode. This is the phenomenon at work at this point in my view.
I do understand the need to establish priorities and I
do agree that universities should be at the leading edge
in terms of their research agenda, but I do not think
the national interest is served when the priorities and
research agenda are at the expense of disciplines that
meet the demand for a workforce that can design, manufacture, inspect, and maintain engineering systems that

<-----Page 5----->4

literally support our daily lives. Power stations, bridges,
pipelines, buildings, airframes, and gas turbines are still
integral to the American standard of living and commercial enterprise. But US bridges and water works are
aging and need attention. Airframes and power plants
are being asked to perform beyond their original design
life. The country needs not only the skills that address
such contemporary engineering systems but also those
that are likely to evolve over the decades ahead.
While the above litany represents a problem in my
view in terms of engineering education, it represents a
challenge and opportunity for the engineering practice.
My concern is that with faculty and industrial practitioner retirements, and without the means to replenish
these skills, the United States will have a serious engineering dilemma on its hands. Engineering education

and research are substantially driven by external funding forces that are seemingly unbalanced.
NAE members, as the leaders of the engineering
enterprise, should exercise their sense of technological statesmanship and take a long, hard look at the
above issues. This would require, I believe, conversations among university executives, federal agency leadership, and science and technology policymakers that
focus not just on ensuring that US research universities
have sustained research support but that these funds are
distributed in keeping with the national interest in the
broadest sense.
I welcome your comments.

Innovations and Opportunities in
Engineering Education
The societal challenges of the 21st century are profound and wide-ranging. Basic needs such as energy,
food and water, housing, mobility, and health will
become even more acute as the world population
exceeds 9 billion. The demands for sustainable development will require redefined and innovative engineering talent and leadership.
In parallel with these changes and challenges, engineering education is embarking on a transformation as
significant as the birth of engineering as a profession
in the 19th century and the establishment of scientific
knowledge as the foundation of engineering in the mid20th century. These changes are driven by the emergence of a connected, competitive, and entrepreneurial
global economy, in which successful engineers increasingly need technical competency and professional skills
that differ from what worked in the past. The stage is
set for a Renaissance period for engineering education.
But at a time when more engineering talent is needed
to address the world’s challenges, the number of students
who are interested in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) is decreasing. This trend is
observed in North America and Europe, the exception
being the Asian countries, especially China and Korea.
Recent initiatives aim to reverse this trend by attracting the best and the brightest to engineering. As discussed by the authors in this issue, these initiatives teach
and nurture the “soft” (people) skills, ensure that the first
year of undergraduate study is an engaging one rather
than a “turn-off,” integrate and offer a holistic approach
to engineering education, introduce entrepreneurship

and the skills that support it, create pathways to attract
talent to STEM-oriented careers, and adapt the curriculum to ensure inclusive learning modalities.
The curriculum of engineering schools is also beginning to change to highlight the creative nature of engineering. The schematic shown in Figure 1 is one that
my colleague Grétar Tryggvason and I have used to
illustrate the creative function of engineering. It shows
dimensions of four broad areas: the humanities, arts, science, and engineering. The humanities are characterized by the study of culture (e.g., literature, art, history),
practitioners of the arts create culture, science entails
study of the physical world, and engineering involves
creation in the physical world.

Shaping Our World: Engineering Education for the 21st Century.

This issue of the Bridge focuses on engineering education and how it must evolve to prepare engineers
to exercise creativity in developing approaches to the
world’s challenges. The authors take a critical look at
both the design and specific components—both existing and proposed—of the engineering curriculum.
They also think broadly about the means of delivery
of engineering education, taking advantage of new

<-----Page 7----->The

technological capacities. Moving to the larger picture,
they consider the roles of the state and of industry.
First, to prepare students for college study of engineering, Enrique Lavernia and Jean VanderGheynst
take up “the algebra challenge,” which too often deters
students from further study in related subjects. They
explain why algebra is particularly difficult for students,
and why mastery of it is crucial to STEM education and
even high school and college graduation. The authors
describe a number of innovative approaches to this
subject that can enhance the success of both students
and teachers.
Susan Ambrose, coauthor of How Learning Works:
Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching
(Jossey-Bass, 2010), then assesses undergraduate engineering curriculum as the “Ultimate Design Challenge,”
describing concepts that have been tested and validated. Importantly, she makes the point that it is time to
stop tweaking curricula and instead be audacious and
embrace and implement what works. The article is well
documented and contains a wealth of references.
Rick Stephens calls for a holistic approach in engineering education, making the point that technical
skills alone are not enough. Engineering education must
also nurture the “soft” skills that are critical to a successful and satisfying career. He presents four measures to
help students learn to work well in teams, communicate
effectively, and create useful products.
David Spencer and George Mehler review educational approaches to better prepare engineering students for
the changing engineering workforce. They describe
opportunities in student-centered education and, interestingly, highlight the importance of—and the feasibility of teaching—character and intuition as well as the
freedom to fail.
Tom Byers, Tina Seelig,1 Sheri Sheppard, and Phil
Weilerstein discuss growing interest in entrepreneurship
education to prepare students for the innovation economy. In 2011, the National Science Foundation (NSF)
awarded a $10 million grant over five years to launch
a national STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP)
Center at Stanford University for teaching innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering. The authors
review initiatives to teach entrepreneurship throughout
the curriculum, and share examples and success stories.

Byers and Seelig won the NAE Bernard M. Gordon Prize in
2009 for “developing and disseminating technology entrepreneurship educational resources for engineering students and educators around the world.”

In addition to the content of engineering education,
the means of delivery is evolving with the development of new technological capacities. Richard Baraniuk addresses open education and considers the needs
and opportunities for changes in methods of delivering
instruction. He is a leader of the open education movement, which aims to share knowledge and teaching
materials freely over the Internet. He launched Connexions, one of the first initiatives to offer free, open
source textbooks via the Web. His comments reaffirm
that the world has greatly changed in the past few
decades, and those who do not adapt to new paradigms
of instructional delivery will be left behind.
Curricular content and delivery are not the whole of
engineering education. Engineers must integrate and
practice their skills in the real world. To that end, educational collaboration beyond the classroom is essential.
Dennis Berkey and Joanne Goldstein illustrate the
role of state government and private enterprises to
close the STEM skills gap. Partnerships between institutions of higher education and the state government
can address local issues that affect competitiveness and
economic well-being. They describe state-sponsored
initiatives in Massachusetts, such as community college internships, outreach to parents and students, and
workforce training and development to support both
career readiness and industry needs.
The final article is by three leaders in engineering
education: Tom Katsouleas, Richard Miller, and Yannis Yortsos. Their focus is the NAE Grand Challenge
Scholars Program and how it is attracting young men
and women who want to contribute and want to make
a difference. What better way to do so than through
engineering?
Taken together, these articles clearly show that engineering education as it has been practiced for the last
five decades is changing—and must—to adapt to the
new realities of the world. And it is about time.

schools that have introduced real-world applications to science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education while at the same time
promoting students’ ability to “get the concepts” over the supposed “intelligence” demonstrated by raw scores on tests. The program featured 8th grade
students at King Middle School in Portland, Maine, who are designing robots
to gather “resources” (in this case, ping pong balls). It also showed students in
a statistics class at New York City’s High School of Telecommunications Arts
and Technology discussing datasets, debating the pros and cons of various
polling techniques, and creating their own exit polls—their teacher intends
her pupils to become producers of information, not just consumers.1
While we’re delighted by the mainstream media exposure granted to these
pilot programs, we’re simultaneously dismayed by the editorial slant that,
Enrique J. Lavernia is dean and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical
Engineering and Materials Science and Jean S. VanderGheynst is associate dean and
professor in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, both at the
University of California–Davis College of Engineering.

in the 21st century, still regards such efforts as unusual
examples of progressive teaching. In this article we focus
on the specific need for innovation in the teaching of
algebra, which for many students is a “wall” too difficult
to scale and stifles their interest in even thinking about
further study in mathematics or other STEM areas.
The Need to Transform STEM Education

Many courses suffer from overly structured styles of
instruction that have been the norm for half a century:
styles that haven’t changed despite great technological
advances that could—should—have prompted exciting
new approaches to teaching. The need to transform traditional approaches to teaching STEM is well established,
as is the awareness that such approaches, particularly in a
“gatekeeper” course such as algebra, are failing miserably.

Traditional instruction
methods in algebra are
failing miserably.
Anecdotal evidence abounds in middle schools from
California to Maine, all of it supported by research
and statistical documentation going back at least three
decades (Tuma and Reif 1980). More recently, a 2000
study demonstrated that women and underrepresented
minority students are particularly ill served by traditional teaching methods (Rech and Harrington 2000),
and a 2008 study revealed that the pass rate for Algebra
I students was a shockingly low 39 percent nationwide
(Gates 2008). A fresh approach is especially critical for
the teaching of algebra, which has been recognized as
the make-or-break moment in students’ K–12 education (Gates 2008; Rech and Harrington 2000). American middle schools, in particular, require innovations
that bridge classroom mathematics instruction with
other STEM tools and activities, particularly computing (Collins and Halverson 2009; NSF 2008).
Our point: This is not fresh information, and yet
nothing has been done at a national level. Politicians,
school boards, and teachers’ unions remain committed
to testing requirements, ignoring the increasingly obvious fact that a top-down realignment of STEM education—starting at the university level and working down
to kindergarten—may be one of the country’s most crucial challenges.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that more
than 800,000 professional information technology jobs
would be added during the decade ending in 2016, an
increase of about 24 percent (Wright 2009). Although
many of these jobs will not require a four-year college
degree, all will demand a solid background in computer
science (Wright 2009). And in California a study by the
Public Policy Institute indicates that by 2025 the state
could face a shortage of up to a million college graduates to meet its skilled workforce demands (Johnson and
Sengupta 2009).
Despite all of this compelling evidence, US education
is actually trending in the wrong direction. Classes in
computer science and computer programming—a powerful means to help solve the “algebra crisis”—either
remain largely absent from many secondary schools or
are declining. The portion of schools offering an introductory programming course dropped from 78 percent
in 2005 to 65 percent in 2012, with a corresponding
drop from 40 to 27 percent in Advanced Placement
classes (Nagel 2009).
People aren’t listening. Or, to be more precise, the
right people aren’t listening.
Trends in US STEM Performance and Ranking

The 2011 California STEM Summit, which took place
October 10–11 at UC Davis, assembled more than 200
K–12, higher education, industry, and nonprofit leaders and policymakers from throughout the state. Participants were engaged and enthusiastic, and generated
more than 350 concepts and suggestions to spark innovation in STEM education (CSLNet 2011).
Lurking behind the collaborative panel discussions
that gave rise to these ideas, however, were the grim
statistics that had prompted the summit. Although in
the 1970s California was a national leader in K–12 and
higher education, in 2011 it ranked 34th among all
states in math and science proficiency in grades 4 and 8
(White and Cottle 2011). The “golden dream”—which
once propelled young students to careers of excellence
in industry, academia, and politics—had become a tarnished waking nightmare (Provasnik et al. 2012).
This disturbing news isn’t confined to California. The
National Center for Education Statistics’ 2011 Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS),
published in December 2012, revealed the problem’s
international scope (Provasnik et al. 2012). The average math and science scores of US 4th grade students
ranked them 11th and 7th, respectively, among the 57

<-----Page 10----->SUMMER 2013

countries and education systems that participated in the
study. The situation is no better for US 8th grade students, whose math and science scores ranked them 9th
and 10th, respectively.
But the rankings may actually obscure the extent of
the achievement gap. Far more troubling is the fact
that the average math score (509) of US 8th graders in
2011 showed no statistical improvement from the previous TIMSS, in 2007 (508), while countries such as the
Republic of Korea, Singapore, and China/Taipei posted
2011 scores of 613, 611, and 609 (Gonzales et al. 2009;
Killewald and Xie 2013).
With a mere one-point improvement over the course
of four years—in the wake of No Child Left Behind—
US students will never catch up. Indeed, they’ll never
get close to catching up.
A Link Between Algebra and Dropout Rates

Children are dropping out of school because of algebra (Helfand 2006) at a time when they are needed for
the nation’s economic security. A study from Education
Week and the Editorial Projects in Education Research
Center reported that 1.3 million high school students
dropped out in 2010—roughly 7,200 per school day.2
And according to a report prepared by the Massachusetts
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,3
•	 Dropping out of school impacts students’ self-esteem
and psychological well-being as they discover that
they lack the skills and knowledge to fulfill their
desires;
•	 Dropouts are 3.5 times more likely than high school
graduates to be incarcerated during their lifetime; and
•	 Earnings for students who quit school continue to
decline: in 1971, male dropouts earned an estimated
$37,087, which decreased by 35 percent to $23,902
in 2002.
Furthermore, a recent survey commissioned by
Raytheon revealed that 89 percent of middle-school

students would rather do chores than math homework,
and 33 percent would rather go to bed early!4 Since
algebra is frequently taught in middle school, this finding may well apply to students’ attitudes about this specific class.
Yet classrooms across the nation continue to teach
algebra the same way it was taught in the 1950s and
’60s. And since California legislators made algebra a
statewide high school graduation requirement in 2004,
more students are failing to graduate. A January 2006
Los Angeles Times article profiled one poor high school
student who, over the course of six semesters, failed
algebra six times. Midway through her senior year, she
returned all her textbooks to the campus book room and
left school for good (Helfand 2006).
“Repeated failure makes kids think they can’t do the
work,” confirmed Andrew Porter, director of the Learning Sciences Institute at Nashville’s Vanderbilt University. “And when they can’t do the work, they say, ‘I’m
out of here’” (Helfand 2006).

Algebra isn’t like the math
courses that come before it.
It is abstract, with variables
instead of integers.
Why Is Algebra So Difficult?

Are the concepts of algebra truly harder than those
explored in, say, fractions or percentages?
We believe the answer is yes.
Algebra isn’t like the math courses that come before
it. It is abstract, with variables instead of integers. Once
letters are inserted for numbers, students get lost. The
information must be presented to them in some other
fashion.
Math is like a foreign language. It comes naturally
to some people; others require lots of time and help.
Some people need to see it in a context that makes
sense to them in order to grasp it. It usually requires
lots of practice.

Students attempting to learn algebra confront many
unique challenges (Rakes et al. 2010). First, algebra is often the first course where students engage in
abstract reasoning and problem solving (Vogel 2008).
Second, unlike basic mathematics—which deals solely with numbers—students must learn the language
of mathematical symbols and the rules of arithmetic
operations (Kilpatrick et al. 2001). Finally, algebra’s
structural characteristics can be too subtle for students
who cannot, for example, recognize the difference
between the expression −x2 + 5x − 6 and the equation
−x2 + 5x − 6 = 0 (Carraher and Schliemann 2007; Howe
2005; Kieran 1992).
The interaction of the three fundamental concepts
of algebra—abstract reasoning, the language of mathematics, and mathematical structure—is a formidable
impediment for many students trying to master algebra
(Rakes et al. 2010).
Innovative Approaches to Teaching Algebra

Although the PBS NewsHour segment presented the
use of robots at King Middle School as revolution-

ary, it’s by no means the only example of innovative
teaching tools. Many schools around the country have
used LEGO Mindstorms NXT to promote K–12 student learning of STEM (Crowley et al. 2003; Franz
and Elmore 2009; Gale et al. 2007; Karp et al. 2010).
The Los Angeles Unified School District has experimentally implemented a high school computer science
curriculum with a full-year course that includes humancomputer interaction, problem solving, Web design,
robotics, computer applications, and an introduction to
programming (Goode and Chapman 2009).
All of this comes as no surprise here at UC Davis,
which is doing something quite similar . . . and it happened almost by accident.
Robotics

Dr. Harry H. Cheng came to UC Davis in 1992 as a
robotics and computing researcher in the College of
Engineering’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering. Since then he has earned numerous honors
and awards, he regularly publishes journal articles and
book chapters, and he has chaired or served as a guest

<-----Page 12----->SUMMER 2013

speaker at dozens of conferences in the United States
and China. Cheng and former graduate student Graham
Ryland recently invented an intelligent, reconfigurable
modular robot—dubbed the “iMobot” (Figure 1)—that
earned a National Science Foundation Innovation
Award grant and was featured in newspapers, magazines,
and on television5 (Anderson 2011).
The design of Cheng’s iMobot technology is affordable, anthropomorphic, and modular, so it has an
immediate appeal to a wide range of learners and serves
as a launch pad for their imagination and creativity.
In various classrooms, iMobots have been configured
and programmed to represent dance troupes, soldiers,
felines, vehicles, and even a barista. One robotic
“game” involves projectiles: if a ball is shot from a specific point and a robot must be programmed to catch it,
students must deal with variables relating to where the
robot will be sent, the force and arc of the projectile,
and so forth.
Tailoring Teaching for Today’s Technology

Cheng has become most passionate about his outreach
activities outside the lab. As director of the UC Davis
K–14 Outreach Center for Integrated Computing and
STEM Education (C-STEM), he has joined colleagues
across the country in recognizing that the computing
and robotics fields are ideal for engaging at-risk students
in K–12 schools. His efforts initially highlighted robotics and computing, but he learned via teacher feedback
that algebra was students’ biggest problem, since they
need to complete that course before moving on to
computing. He therefore shifted his focus to help K–12
teachers present algebra in a manner that resonates with
their students.
Cheng has come away with some strong opinions.
“This is the 21st century, but some of the teaching
methodology hasn’t been updated with the times,” he
notes. “Teaching skill sets learned 30 years ago won’t cut
it; today’s kids are too tech savvy for that.”
The idea is to tailor the teaching curriculum for
young students whose lives are consumed by smart
phones, MP3 players, tablets, and all sorts of other
technical gadgets. Cheng views his fields, computing
and robotics, as a natural fit—a way to depart from rote
pencil-and-paper exercises. And he’s quick to clarify a

key point: He’s not talking about building new curricula, with more funding and fancy technology, solely
for the benefit of top-tier students, most of whom arguably don’t need such help. He worries most about at-risk
students, the ones who often get left behind. He wishes
to better educate all students, not just those who plan
to attend college.

It’s important to better educate
all students, not just those who
plan to attend college.
Programs for Teachers

Cheng’s passion and innovative methodology have
drawn the attention of the National Science Foundation, which in September 2012 awarded a pair of grants.
The first, a two-year grant in the amount of $300,000,
will help Cheng study collaborative mathematics learning—specifically algebra—with robots. The second provides $950,000 over three years to study how the use
of robotics programs in schools can change students’
attitudes toward STEM subjects. For his research in
both these areas, Cheng and his co-investigators have
recruited teachers from Sacramento-area schools, from
grades 6 and up, and provided them with robots, teaching resources, and training.
The grants have allowed Cheng to expand programs
he had already put in place. The Computing Research
Experiences for STEM Teachers (CREST) project,
inaugurated in 2011, was designed to create an enduring partnership between UC Davis faculty members and
local secondary school STEM teachers, to help the latter
guide their students toward further C-STEM studies and
related careers. The program is supporting 45 computer
science and STEM teachers—15 per year, for three years:
11 in-service teachers and 4 preservice teachers each
year—as CREST Fellows. These individuals join Cheng
for six-week summer programs, augmented by follow-up
seminars and discussions that continue through the participating teachers’ academic year. As a result, more than
30 schools from 20 districts in the greater Sacramento
region have adopted the C-STEM research-based algebra and computing curricula, and roughly 1,500 K–12
students have benefited.

collaboratively, in a search for relevance in their schoolwork. Deep learning promotes a level of long-term
retention generally absent from traditional methods
that are more apt to focus on memorization (Halpern
and Hakal 2002; Millis 2010).
Additionally, collaborative learning tasks are effective because they encourage—even necessitate—contributions from each member (Cohen 1994), compelling
participants to engage with the task and each other (Barron 2000, 2003). In other words, circumstances both
require and allow for students to function effectively as
a group, and thus more accurately mirror how STEM
careers actually function in industry.
The Importance of Incentive

Incentive is another variable in the equation. Even now,
in too many schools, passing algebra means only one
thing: being “allowed” to take geometry. And passing
geometry grants entry to Algebra II. That’s not much of
a carrot; children must be captivated by tempting goals.
But even with hands-on relevance in the presence of
robotics, algebra remains a wall to be climbed. Students
must be encouraged to understand the exciting goals
that await on the far side of that wall, which means
opening a dialogue about future careers at a much
earlier age.
Such dialogue is particularly crucial in populations
where parents didn’t attend college, or where there
is an absence of a supportive environment at home.
Having such conversations early is important, because
these students aren’t exposed to college—it’s not discussed in their homes, and they may not have relatives
who went to college. Children need to be told about
the possibility of additional, specialized education
after high school and the benefits of pursuing such
an education.
And yet such conversations aren’t integrated into
today’s K–12 curriculum. Unless a good relationship
exists between a local college and a school, students
may not get that message.
Moving Forward

Although the feedback from Cheng’s middle and high
school teacher-collaborators is encouraging, the results
thus far are anecdotal, lacking the authoritative stamp
of carefully tabulated results over time. For that reason, Cheng is working closely with research associates
at the WestEd STEM Education Group to gather the
hard data that will be necessary to build his local pro-

13

gram into something larger. “If pilot programs are to be
respected in the long term, and have a genuine impact,”
says WestEd’s Jennifer Mullin, “you must have a good
research agenda and plenty of data.”
But that takes time. The 854,000 new professional
information technology jobs reported by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics need to be filled now, and the number
increases each year. Potential candidates for those jobs
are already in middle or high school.
And yet the innovative, breakthrough—and successful—teaching methods being used at a few forwardthinking schools from Maine to California are still
regarded as little more than pilot programs and novelties. They need to expand; they need to become national programs.
We at the university level—professors, department
chairs, and deans—must become much more aggressive, much more vocal, in our demand that hidebound
instructional techniques be replaced. We must insist on
better preparation of students to fill college and university classrooms with engaged and resourceful undergraduates and postgraduates, who in turn will stimulate
American tech industries that are desperate for inventive minds.
The few dozen K–12 teachers involved in such programs need to be given a stage from which they can
share their results, so that instructors in classrooms
across the country can experience the miracle of a oncefailing algebra student who looks up one day and excitedly says, “I get this now!”

Undergraduate Engineering
Curriculum
The Ultimate Design Challenge

Susan A. Ambrose

Susan A. Ambrose is Vice
Provost for Teaching and
Learning and professor of
education at Northeastern
University.

wo decades ago I witnessed a dramatic event unfold in engineering education. Believing that “real impact in engineering education will be made
only by looking at the curriculum as a whole” (authors’ italics, not mine), an
engineering department at a major research university decided to engage in
curriculum review and revision by taking what they called a “wipe the slate
clean” approach (Director et al. 1995, p. 1246). At the time, I thought it
a commonplace occurrence in higher education, or at least in engineering.
But much of what has been done in the intervening years in engineering
education, while promoting and deepening learning in specific courses and/
or a specific year in the curriculum, has not in fact transformed engineering
education across the country because engineering departments rarely take a
“wipe the slate clean,” holistic approach.
In this article, I highlight some of the most important findings from
learning research that have been piloted and/or integrated into engineering
courses or curricula around the country. These interconnected and interacting findings support the educational value of building curricula that provide
•	 context and continual integration across time and courses that promote
transfer of existing knowledge and skills to new contexts;
•	 early exposure to engineering and engineers to lay the foundation for
future learning;

<-----Page 18----->SUMMER 2013

•	 meaningful engagement at the most auspicious time
to promote deep learning;
•	 opportunities for reflection to connect thinking and
doing;
•	 development of students’ metacognitive abilities to
foster self-directed, lifelong learning skills; and
•	 authentic experiential learning opportunities to put
theory into practice in the real world.
The work in engineering that has focused on the
above is important, with results that have impacted
learning, but because it is not coordinated or continual
I question whether it is enough. I advocate the need to
do all of the above concurrently and continually across the
curriculum, in an intentional and coherent way, which
may require a “wipe the slate clean” approach to the
design of 21st century engineering education.
Context and Continual Integration Promote
Transfer of Knowledge and Skills

For many instructors, the end goal of learning is the
ability to use knowledge and skills flexibly in novel
situations. Success in meeting this goal requires learners to transfer what they know to new settings or problems, which means first recognizing what is needed in a
given context, then accessing and using the appropriate
knowledge and intellectual skills.
Research (Glaser 1992; Simon 1980) shows that
knowledge remains inert unless it is “conditionalized” (i.e., it includes conditions of applicability), and
that students often don’t use relevant information
in problem solving because they don’t recognize the
need for it. Hence knowledge that is overly contextualized (e.g., traditional physics, chemistry, and calculus courses with “context-bound” examples) can
impede transfer.
Conversely, when students are exposed to multiple
contexts (think of a physics professor using engineering
and architecture as well as physics examples to illustrate physics concepts), they are more likely to abstract
relevant features, enabling them to recognize and use
that knowledge flexibly in new contexts (Gick and
Holyoak 1983). This research reinforces the notion
that transfer is an active process of its own, and does
not happen easily or automatically. It is essential to create a curriculum with the conditions and opportunities
for transfer, as is being done at places such as California Polytechnic State University (Linda Vanasupa,

17

California Polytechnic State University, email correspondence, January 15, 2013).
Of course, other aspects of context beyond integrating math, science, and engineering are important. For
example, the social context of engineering involves
understanding how the technical is shaped by the
social and how much the technical can reshape the
social (Adams et al. 2011). Teaching in this context is
especially important to women and minorities as well as
in battling the misconception of potential students and
parents who view engineers as insensitive to social concerns (Vest 2011). A program at Worcester Polytechnic
Institute (WPI) exemplifies the effort to address this
concern: first-year students are engaged in solving complex technosocial problems under such broad categories
as “Feed the World,” “Power the World,” and “Heal the
World” (Tryggvason and Apelian 2012).

The end goal of learning
is the ability to use
knowledge and skills flexibly
in novel situations.
Integration across contexts and over time is exactly
what senior capstone courses are lauded for: They provide opportunities for students to make connections
among ideas, approaches, experiences, and courses, and
to synthesize and transfer what they’ve learned to new
and complex situations. Yet leading engineering education researchers continue to voice concern that the
current educational model is not effective in preparing
engineering students to integrate knowledge, skills (and
identity) as developing professionals (Dall’Alba 2009;
Sheppard et al. 2008; Stevens et al. 2008). In other
words, the senior capstone course is necessary but not
sufficient in meeting the educational goal of integration.
Because integration and transfer are important
components of deep learning,1 students should be
1Deep approaches to learning—which result in long-term retention—require students to actively search for meaning (e.g., relating new information to their prior knowledge, organizing and
structuring information meaningfully, looking for patterns and
underlying principles, and engaging in self-explanation; Entwistle
and Peterson 2004), whereas students who use surface approaches
to learning focus on memorization, discrete elements, and the like.

<-----Page 19----->18

continually engaged in these intellectual processes
throughout the curriculum—not just in their final
year—and at an increasingly sophisticated level. In
fact, mastery requires students to acquire component
knowledge and skills, practice them to the point that
they can combine them fluently, and then use them when
and where appropriate (Ambrose et al. 2010). Such
continual integrative experiences help students to
expand and deepen their “internal knowledge structure” of the discipline (i.e., organized networks of
information stored in long-term memory), which will
aid their eventual retrieval and use (Bransford and
Schwartz 1999).
In short, very few undergraduate engineering programs provide courses each year (or at least activities
within courses) that promote integration across context
and time. A notable exception is the Olin College of
Engineering, where students engage in “hands-on design
projects in every year.”2 But why is this the exception
and not the rule?

Introducing students to
engineering and design in the
first year leads to a powerful
learning experience.
Early Exposure Lays the Foundation for Future
Learning

I’ve established the importance of learning in context,
and since many engineers engage in design, using that
context to learn both knowledge and skills makes sense.
A myriad of additional reasons explain why introducing
students to engineering and design in the first year leads
to a powerful learning experience.
First, research clearly indicates that students are
more motivated to learn—and thus engage in the behaviors that lead to learning—when they see value in what
they are being asked to do (Ambrose et al. 2010). Introducing them to the “big picture” of engineering and

edu/academics/olin_history/vision.aspx.

The

BRIDGE
to “thinking like an engineer” can be motivating on
several levels, including helping to show the relevance
of the concurrent fundamental science and math courses they are taking.
Second, beyond learning the necessary technical
aspects of engineering, students must learn intellectual
skills, including the approaches engineers take as they
engage in problem solving and design. The sooner students begin to approach their studies with the “habits of
mind” that professional engineers engage in the better,
because these intellectual skills can provide an overarching framework for the rest of the curriculum and
cocurriculum.
Third, design projects in the first year get students
into teams early (replicating “real world” engineering)
and connect them with engineering faculty (Agogino
et al. 1992). Finally, as mentioned, design projects that
focus on the social impact of engineering work may
address the problems of attracting more women and
underrepresented minorities.
Engineering educators know that early design courses
should focus more heavily on conceptual design methods and less on discipline-specific artifacts, as first-year
students don’t have the technical background to do
the work (Dym et al. 2005; Kilgore et al. 2007). That
is exactly what happened in one of the most notable
and long-standing programs of this nature, which
began at Harvey Mudd in 1955, where all majors were
required to take project-based freshmen engineering
design courses (Dym 1994). These courses were created to reinforce the notions that design is open-ended
(hence several teams working independently and in
parallel on the same project); that there are numerous
engineering challenges beyond domains such as aerospace, computing, and manufacturing (hence sponsors of projects are broadly representative and include
nonprofits); and that students could begin to think
and work like engineers (hence introducing skills
like structuring ill-structured problems, decomposing
problems, identifying parameters and constraints, and
working in teams).
Other universities followed suit, particularly in the
1990s and especially through some of the NSF-funded
coalitions, and created first-year project and design
courses “as a means for students to be exposed to some
flavor of what engineers actually do while enjoying an
experience where they could learn the basic design elements of the design process by doing real design projects” (Dym et al. 2005, p. 103).

<-----Page 20----->SUMMER 2013

With so much evidence supporting an early integrative approach to engineering education, why aren’t
these types of courses universal by now?
Meaningful Classroom Engagement Leads to
Deeper Learning

A critical component of learning is deliberate practice coupled with targeted feedback (Ambrose et al.
2010); in fact, students learn what they practice and
only what they practice. Yet this important learning
activity is typically relegated to out-of-class time,
ensuring that students do not get the immediate and
constructive feedback they may need early in the
learning process when the material is new, or when
they are dealing with novel, complex problems. This
lack of feedback has led, over many years, to the call
for more in-class opportunities for students to practice and get feedback in real time from instructors and
peers, a practice some call “pedagogies of engagement”
(Smith et al. 2005). This type of pedagogy provides
opportunities in class for students to apply concepts or
principles, consider alternative approaches or designs,
and engage in other learning activities that enable
the instructor to detect and address errors in students’
thinking.
While there are numerous effective ways to accomplish meaningful engagement during class, one of the
most notable is the “peer instruction” strategy developed
by Mazur (1997). In this model, after a short presentation, students are asked a conceptual question, given
time to formulate and record their answer individually,
discuss their answer with a peer, and, if necessary, revise
their answer. This approach gets students talking about
the problems, leading to deeper information processing, and enables peers and instructors to identify and
address misconceptions on the spot and respond to gaps
in understanding.
An equally effective and much used method in
higher education, the case study, typically presents
a realistic, complex, and contextually rich problem
situation that requires connecting theory and practice (Barkley et al. 2005; Richards et al. 1995). If
structured effectively, in-class case analysis provides
an opportunity for analytical and integrative thinking with the added bonus of immediate feedback from
peers and the instructor. There are examples from as
early as the 1960s of case-based teaching and learning in engineering education (Raju and Sankar 1999;
Yadav et al. 2010).

19

Finally, there are simulations, problem-based learning activities, collaborative and cooperative learning
activities, the flipped or inverted classroom, and other classroom-based practices that can be done in real
time to provide the same kind of practice and feedback
opportunities as peer instruction and case studies
(Prince and Felder 2006; Smith et al. 2005).
With so many sound examples of meaningful
classroom engagement in engineering education
publications and proceedings, why aren’t such engaging activities embedded in every course across the
curriculum?
Reflection Connects Thinking and Doing

When students engage in meaningful and frequent
reflection about what they are learning, they are less
likely to “have the experience but miss the meaning,”
because reflection provides a “continual interweaving of
thinking and doing” (Schön 1983, p. 280). It generates,
deepens, and documents learning (Ash and Clayton
2004). In fact, studies show that students who “repeat-

Students learn only what
they practice, and targeted
feedback is a critical
component of such learning.
edly engage in structured reflection…are more likely to
bring a strategic learning orientation to new challenges”
(Eyler 2009, p. 28; Eyler and Giles 1999), reinforcing
the end goal of learning as the ability to use knowledge
and skills flexibly in novel situations.
There is no better way to get students to reflect on
their learning than through writing. A rich literature
focused on “writing to learn” (Fulwiler and Young 1982;
Parker and Goodkin 1987) establishes the theoretical
links among writing, thinking, and learning across a
variety of disciplines. Embedding writing across the curriculum can help to promote deeper processing (enhancing students’ ability to retrieve and use knowledge
flexibly) by, for example, prompting students’ reflection
about what they are learning, how it connects to what
they already know, and how they might use that knowledge in the future. Incorporation of reflection across the

<-----Page 21----->20

curriculum may be easier now because of the emergence
of technologies such as e-portfolios (which allow students to assemble and showcase electronic evidence of
their learning), which some institutions are using as a
foundation for student reflection on their learning and
performance; and it has indeed found its way into engineering education (Adams et al. 2003; Heinrich et al.
2007; Knott et al. 2004).
So, yes, students learn by doing, but only when they
have time to reflect on what they are doing—the two go
hand in hand. Why, then, don’t engineering curricula
provide constant structured opportunities and time to
ensure that continual reflection takes place?
Metacognition Supports the Development of
Lifelong Learning Skills

The vast majority of institutions of higher education in
the United States articulate the need to prepare students to be lifelong learners so they can thrive in the
current and future workforce. Numerous studies project
the number of different jobs current students will have
over their careers. Today’s students will work in jobs
that don’t yet exist. Information quickly becomes obsolete. For all these reasons, it is essential to ensure that
students can continue to learn independently, which
requires engaging in metacognition, often defined as the
process of reflecting on and directing one’s own thinking (Bransford et al. 2000).

In-class engagement can
provide an opportunity
for analytical and integrative
thinking, with immediate
feedback from peers and
the instructor.
The iterative cycle of self-directed learning requires
students to engage in a number of processes:
•	 assessing the task at hand, including goals and
constraints;
•	 evaluating their own knowledge and skills, including
strengths and weaknesses;

The

BRIDGE
•	 planning their approach in a way that accounts for
the current situation;
•	 applying various strategies to enact the plan and
monitoring their progress; and
•	 reflecting on the degree to which their current
approach is working so that they can adjust and
restart the cycle as needed (Ambrose et al. 2010).
This cycle might seem like “common sense” to many
faculty members, but research reveals that, while experts
engage in these processes, often unconsciously, novices
do not (Ambrose et al. 2010). Furthermore, metacognition is rarely formally or explicitly addressed in courses
or curricula. But students must be “quickly disabused of
the notion that scientists and engineers work mostly on
problems that can be solved using memorized facts and
procedures” (Felder and Brent 2004, p. 283). They need
to learn how to learn.
As noted above, reflection and writing can help students become more cognizant of their own learning process and can promote their ability to continue to learn
throughout life (Ash and Clayton 2004). Again, a few
engineering educators are exploring how to prepare students for lifelong learning (Heinrich et al. 2007; Jiusto
and DiBiasio 2006), but why aren’t all focused on this
critical intellectual skill?
Experiential Learning Opportunities Connect
Theory and Practice in Authentic Settings

Experiential learning is, simply put, learning by doing.
As Eyler (2009, p. 28) notes, “theory lacks meaning
outside of practice.” Experiential learning naturally
integrates theory and practice. And it happens in
the classroom or lab (e.g., in design projects, capstone projects, case studies, simulations), although
many would argue that it is much more powerful and
robust when students have opportunities to use their
knowledge and practice their skills in off-campus,
real-world situations (e.g., co-ops, internships, service
learning).
Furthermore, experiential learning opportunities
prompt learning when students are put in unfamiliar
situations for which they are not prepared and yet must
act in order to get a job done. In other words, it provides
practice in using self-directed learning skills and transferring what they know across contexts and over time to
novel situations, as described above.
Over the past decade, because of increasing concern about the quality of higher education (Arum and

<-----Page 22----->SUMMER 2013

Roksa 2011; Bok 2006), scholars have sought to understand what experiences correlate to “the most powerful” learning outcomes (Kuh 2008).3 They have used
their data to call for, among other things, the design
of more “high-impact courses” as well as “greater
fluidity and connection between the formal curriculum and the experiential co-curriculum” (Bass 2012,
p. 26). Bass (2012, p. 28) also suggests that the optimal
way to learn is “reciprocally or spirally between practice and content,” a reverse of typical curricula that
are built from content and eventually engage students
in practice. The best-case scenario, according to Bass
(2012), is an educational environment that weaves
the connections back and forth across the formal and
experiential curriculum. This strongly speaks to experiential learning in general, and specifically to cooperative learning.
Experiential learning also enables university students to bring back and integrate into the classroom
both the authentic applications of their knowledge
and skills and the new knowledge and skills they have
gained. Thus experiential learning not only strengthens and deepens what students already know and can
do, but also provides an expanded platform for future
learning. In short, experiential learning opportunities
and formal academic programs can inform and complement each other.
Many engineering programs engage students in
experiential learning activities such as co-op or service
learning, and some engineering faculty members have
tried to assess the impact of these experiences on selfdirected, lifelong learning (Jiusto and DiBiasio 2006).
The perceived value of such experiential programs is
validated by engineering education research indicating
that students see extracurricular experiences such as
co-ops and internships as more representative of what
it means to be an engineer than their in-class experiences, and they report a steep learning curve in their
first job when this element is missing from their education (Korte et al. 2008).
Why should students wait until they enter the workforce to apply what they have learned?

3

High-impact practices include undergraduate research, study
abroad, service learning, internships, learning communities, and
capstone courses. According to Kuh’s research, these practices correlate with high retention and persistence rates as well as student
behaviors that lead to meaningful learning gains.

Conclusion: Putting It All Together—A Systems
Approach

The examples discussed here, and many more documented in engineering education journals and
elsewhere, show that the engineering education community has accumulated a rich body of knowledge over
the past 20 years and implemented many successful educational innovations that have had impact on student
learning. Why, then, haven’t there been major changes
in engineering curricula and more students flocking to
the field?

Students report a steep
learning curve in their
first job when hands-on
extracurricular experience is
missing from their education.
One answer is that we (faculty) rarely reflect on
the larger context. Rather, we focus on what we have
immediate control over, our courses. However, to effect
significant change, we must redesign by leveraging and
integrating continually across the curriculum the results
of the solid work done by engineering education and
learning sciences researchers. No one knows better than
engineers the importance of systems thinking in problem solving and design, and yet much of the wonderful work that has been done in engineering education
has focused on pieces of the curriculum rather than the
whole of the curriculum and beyond. Since we operate in a dynamic system—that includes student expectations, faculty beliefs, departmental norms, college
resources, university culture, societal needs, and global
challenges—we must recognize that curricular change
takes place in a broader context and requires, for example, faculty buy-in, departmental leadership, and necessary resources.
This brings me back to the story I alluded to at the
beginning of this paper. Let me end with that experience and the main lessons I draw from it.
It was the Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE) Department at Carnegie Mellon University that,
in 1989, adopted a “wipe the slate clean” approach to
curriculum review and revision, a two-year process that

<-----Page 23----->22

resulted in a radically different curriculum that proved
to have many long-term advantages (Director et al.
1995). The transformative process first required recognition that “real impact in engineering education will
be made only by looking at the curriculum as a whole”
(p. 1246; authors’ italics). It also required acknowledging that knowledge in the field of ECE was expanding
rapidly, but the time to degree was not, so some difficult
decisions needed to be made.
As a result, the new curriculum addressed some of
the issues discussed above—for example, the need for
students to (1) see the big picture, i.e., the connected
view of the ideas that define the discipline; (2) integrate
across courses rather than experience the curriculum as
a set of discrete courses; and (3) come into contact with
engineering faculty and engineering ideas during the
first year. This revision resulted in, among other things,
new courses at the freshman level and more flexibility for students in the curriculum (e.g., a smaller core
of required classes, area requirements instead of course
requirements, free electives). These were major changes,
not minor tweaks. But more importantly, the approach
spread to the entire engineering college as other departments followed suit.
Why is this story so instructive? First, it happened
almost 25 years ago and, although a few other universities took a similar radical approach to reengineering
engineering education both before and after CMU (e.g.,
Drexel, MIT), this type of revision has been the exception, not the rule. Second, such transformation required
leadership and support at the department and college
levels, as well as collaboration among the entire faculty
because “everything was up for grabs.” Finally, it took
time and resources, provided by the department head
(and when it spread to the college, the dean), which
signaled the importance of the endeavor.
Where does this leave us in 2013? We have bold
models (both old and new) to follow; we know a lot
about how learning works; and what we know has been
applied at a “micro” level to engineering education. It
is time to move beyond tweaking individual courses or
revamping one year of the curriculum. We need to be
audacious enough to put the pieces together in a coherent, encompassing way across engineering curricula.

Engineering is an integral part of daily life and can provide a strong foundaDavid B. Spencer

tion for almost any career path. Teaching about the wondrously engineered
world and drawing on everyday existence for teaching examples can make
learning fun and relevant. Yet engineering faces a number of challenges,
many of them rooted in education:

•	 Engineering educational approaches are stale and need updating
(Tryggvason and Apelian 2012).
•	 The proportion of US college graduates in engineering is low and dropping (NSF 2006).
•	 Dropout rates are much higher in engineering than in other areas of college study (Dodge 2008).

•	 Girls and young women do not see engineering as a pathway to multiple
career choices (Wang et al. 2013).
•	 Engineering education at the high school level, let alone lower grades, is
virtually nonexistent.
David B. Spencer is founder and chairman of wTe Corporation, a high-tech plastics and
metals recycling company in Bedford, Massachusetts. George Mehler is K–12 Science
Supervisor of the Central Bucks School District in Pennsylvania and an adjunct professor

<-----Page 26----->SUMMER 2013

Is it any wonder that most young students have misconceptions of engineering? Among critical factors to
attract young students into engineering are:
•	 Training in math, science, and engineering, which
should begin at an earlier age;
•	 Teacher training and new curricula to help students
learn in a way that is fun and exciting; and
•	 Hands-on learning opportunities, such as field trips
and camps that focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), to show the value of engineering and correct misconceptions about
both academic and professional engineering.
Doing these things effectively at the K–12 level should
increase the number of high school students who pursue
engineering in college—and afford them a glimpse of the
social and monetary value of an engineering degree.

to (i) know, use, and interpret scientific explanations
of the natural world; (ii) generate and evaluate scientific evidence and explanations; (iii) understand the
nature and development of scientific knowledge; and
(iv) participate productively in scientific practices and
discourse. This approach to science teaching will require a
shift from the teacher-centered instruction common in science
classrooms to more student-centered methods of instruction.
The defining feature of these instructional methods is
who is doing the sense-making. In teacher-centered instruction the sense-making is accomplished by the teacher and
transmitted to students through lecture, textbooks, and
confirmatory activities in which each step is specified by
the teacher. In these classrooms, the instructional goal
is to help students know scientific explanations, which
is only part of the first aspect of scientific proficiency.
In student-centered instruction, the sense-making rests
with the students, and the teacher acts as a facilitator
to support the learning as students engage in scientific
practices. [Emphases added.]

Student-Centered Education

How should engineering education change over the next
20 years? The practice of lecturing to impart knowledge
should change to a model in which the teacher asks
key questions and acts as a coach, and students develop
their own individual learning program to address the
questions, working alone or in groups.
Growing Interest in Student-Centered Education

In a great TED talk in 2010, Sugata Mitra, winner of
the 2013 Ted Prize, argued that teaching does not equal
learning. He has gone on to make a compelling case for
the benefits of a “self-organized learning environment”
along with “encouragement.” His hypothesis is that the
teaching curriculum should be one of asking questions,
standing back in awe, and letting education happen,
particularly in a small group environment. While his
approach may not be fully appropriate for all aspects
of future engineering education, it certainly provides
much-needed food for thought about the effectiveness of past and present engineering teaching methods
and practices.
An article entitled “The Efficacy of Student-Centered Instruction in Supporting Science Learning”
(Granger et al. 2012, p. 105) cites numerous studies on
the need for a different approach to teaching science,
including one study by the National Research Council
that synthesized research and suggested that
the goal of science instruction should be to help students
develop four aspects of scientific proficiency, the ability

Learning can be practical,
relevant, and fun.
Examples of Student-Centered Education

The Birches School in Lincoln, Massachusetts, dynamically incorporates STEM and art (thus “STEAM”) in
teaching grades K–2 (with the addition of a grade a
year it will become a K–6 school). The Birches School
children are learning math, biology, physics, chemistry,
materials, computers, reading, and writing—all as an
integrated knowledge base. They don’t study individual
subjects as such but rather learn them by working on
their own and in small groups with the guidance and
encouragement of their teacher.
This past winter, for example, the children decided
they wanted to learn more about birds, so the teachers adjusted the curriculum accordingly. The children
became “citizen scientists,” part of ProjectFeederWatch
administered by the Lab of Ornithology at Cornell University. They observed three bird feeders for 15 minutes
a day on two consecutive days a week, counting and
then graphing the number of birds of different species
that they saw. They made scientific drawings of birds,
measured wingspans, and learned from recordings the
calls of various local birds. They dissected pellets spit up
by owls to discover the fur and bones of ingested prey,

<-----Page 27----->26

then sorted the bones in categories, identified them,
and mounted them. They each chose a bird to research,
reading age-appropriate materials, and wrote a report
and presented their findings to classmates. Finally, they
created collages of birds and papier mâché birds.
Learning for the Birches School students is practical, relevant, and fun. Surely there is some wisdom in
this program that could be applied to middle school,
high school, and undergraduate engineering teaching
methods.
At the undergraduate level, Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) sets up three qualifying projects
for students as they begin their studies (described in
Tryggvason and Apelian 2012, p. ix):
•	 The interactive qualifying project (IQP) engages
small teams of students in addressing complicated,
broad-based problems of societal importance, many
carried out in other countries;
•	 The major qualifying project (MQP) is essentially a
team-based capstone project; and
•	 The sufficiency project demonstrates mastery of subject matter in the humanities and arts.

Students will pursue that which
is fun to learn even if it involves
significant hard work.
The approach at WPI encourages self-learning, working in teams, communication, and collaboration, in part
by allowing students to choose a topic tied to perceived
social needs.
Individual engineers, working in isolation through
what might be called constructive dissonance or individual genius, may in some cases germinate better
ideas than teams and foster pursuit of out-of-the-box
approaches, but working in teams is extremely important in much of an engineer’s professional life. Further,
many students want a career that is both challenging
and provides social interaction.
In short, engineering schools need to modernize their
messages and their curriculum. If not, students will choose
another field of study that seems more relevant and creates higher value for them. They will pursue that which
is fun to learn even if it involves significant hard work.

National Standards and Opportunities to
Introduce STEM in K–12

Very few young students are exposed to STEM, let alone
engineering, at an early age. In the 20th century, most
public and private schools in the United States focused
on topics and skills that were important to their school
or school district. Few states had developed standards
for their schools, and on the national level there were
no content standards that might help focus a K–12 program or particular courses. This lack of curricular focus
meant that there was, and still is to a large extent, large
variability in the content and skills that students are
expected to master.
This situation started to change with the development of national standards—in mathematics (1989),
English language arts (1996), and science (1996).
Developed by experts and exceptional educators in each
field, these standards were groundbreaking. But US education policy is set mostly by states and local school districts rather than by the federal government. So many
schools did not adopt these standards, if they developed
or used standards at all.
In 2001, the federal government passed the No Child
Left Behind Act, requiring states to develop assessments
in basic skills, establish levels of achievement, and
assess students each year. In the absence of an established national level of achievement, each state was free
to determine its own.
In 2009, the National Governors Association developed curricular standards for literacy (English language
arts, or ELA) and mathematics, usually referred to as the
Common Core standards. But there is an important difference from the earlier standards movement: this time
45 states have said they will adopt these standards. For
the first time the United States will have a national set
of education standards in ELA and mathematics.
But what about new science education standards?
Building on the Common Core movement, the
National Research Council, with support from the
Carnegie Corporation, is developing the Next Generation Science Standards (Schweingruber et al. 2013).
Hopefully, states will adopt these new science education
standards just as they have adopted the Common Core
in ELA and mathematics. As a first step, the National
Research Council released A Framework for K–12 Science Education Standards in July 2011. In December 2012
the NRC published A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas,
and in summer 2013 a consortium of states together

with the American Association for the Advancement
of Science and the National Science Teachers Association will release the actual standards.
One of the exciting additions to the new standards is,
for the first time, the inclusion of engineering concepts
and principles. The Next Generation Science Standards build on the three “core idea” areas—physical sciences, life sciences, and earth-space sciences—and add
a fourth, engineering, technology, and the applications
of science.
America’s future leaders, pioneers, entrepreneurs,
dreamers, and citizens need to understand the beauty,
wonder, and power that are unleashed through experience and knowledge of science and engineering, and
this understanding must start at a young age. The Next
Generation Science Standards make engineering principles an important part of education for even very
young students. This is an important breakthrough for
engineering education.
The Internet and Open, Interactive, Personal
Teaching Opportunities

If the new national standards are adopted (and at this
point there is no certainty that they will be), there will
remain other challenges in creating world-class science
education in the United States.
Many schools provide little or no time for science
education until students enter high school. A recent
study of elementary science education in the San Francisco Bay Area—home to much US innovation in science and technology—reported that 80 percent of K–5
teachers spend 60 minutes per week or less on science,
and that 16 percent of them spend no time at all on the
subject (Dorph et al. 2007). In the same study, teachers reported feeling that they were ill prepared to teach
science and had few opportunities to improve their
preparation. Lesson plans and experiments are available on the Internet, and teacher camps exist, but more
is needed.
Nurturing an interest in science early in life is important for students to learn about its wonder and beauty
as well as opportunities and careers in science. But the
necessary funding, teacher time, and training are not
available. The engineering community needs to give
thought and energy to how that can be changed.
Technology and expanded use of the Internet may
help in efforts to address this problem. The past 10 years
have seen an explosion of web tools for interactivity,
collaboration, support, and individualized learning. So

27

the Internet can change the playing field in a manner
not possible in the past.
In particular, the Internet can be a source of free,
research-based, high-quality professional development
for teachers (free access is the best way to reach financially disadvantaged schools and teachers). Beyond scientific facts, teachers need a resource that shows them
how to teach the skills, concepts, and practices of science and engineering, to enable students to understand
what makes these fields different from other forms of
human endeavor. Access to such learning also shows
students that everyone can do science.

America’s future leaders,
pioneers, entrepreneurs,
dreamers, and citizens need
to understand the beauty,
wonder, and power of science
and engineering, and this
understanding must start at
a young age.
Many US schools have many hurdles to overcome—
poverty, inadequate resources, collapsing facilities,
lack of qualified teachers. Technology can help in one
area: the delivery of world-class curricula and professional development for teachers, which they can learn
in an asynchronous manner. The recent proliferation
of MOOCs (massive open online courses) may help
(evidence indicates that only about 10 percent of students complete these courses, but use of this educational
resource is still in its early days).
Through the skilled use of open-source, interactive,
and supportive technology the United States has the
opportunity to empower teachers to improve their own
capabilities and those of their students, including raising
their level of science knowledge to meet the national
standards. Such technology can—and should—be made
available to all students and teachers, not just those that
can afford it. But teachers will continue to be a critical
influence on successful learning.

<-----Page 29----->28

A recent ExxonMobil initiative called Let’s Solve
This reports on its website that research shows the
importance of investing in teachers and concludes:
If we want to improve our schools, what should we invest
in? . . . [R]ecent research shows that nothing transforms
schools like investing in advanced teacher education.
. . . Let’s invest in our teachers so they can inspire our
students.

Properly trained and equipped teachers are needed
as mentors, coaches, and encouragers. To paraphrase
Rachel Carson (1965),
If children are to keep alive an inborn sense of wonder,
they need the companionship of at least one adult who
can share it, rediscovering with them the joy, excitement, and mystery of the world we live in.

If better professional development can help more
teachers become that “one adult,” more children will
understand science, the world, and their place in it.

Effective engineers can
draw on their intuition to
discern among fact, opinion,
and motive to arrive at
sound judgments.
Opportunities to Incorporate the Arts and
Encourage Intuition

Engineers are human beings first and engineers second—or they should be. They must deal not only with
the facts and laws of science and engineering but with
people, so they must also have a sense of the arts, character, and positive purpose and integrity. They need
sensitivity and empathy. They must be able to piece
together sparse information, conflicting data, and
distinguish truth from perception. With attention to
people’s facial expressions and intonations, effective
engineers need to draw on their intuition to discern
among fact, opinion, and motive to arrive at sound
judgments. They need to appreciate that, although
engineering examinations often require a single right
answer, many real-world situations are characterized
by shades of grey and may not have just one right
answer. For all these reasons, engineering education

The

BRIDGE
should expand to include the arts and humanities—and
respect for intuitive skills.
Philosophers through the ages have pondered the
human liability to ignore intuition, resulting in decisions and actions guided by overrationalization—even
in the knowledge that those decisions and actions are
wrong. Because engineers’ work—their decisions and
actions—directly affects millions of everyday lives, it is
crucial that they heed their intuition at every stage.
Those who have read the book Blink: The Power of
Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell (2005)
will understand how much faster the right brain can be
at taking in data, both consciously and unconsciously,
than the more deliberate left brain. Gladwell (2005,
265) observes that
The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is
understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are
desperately lacking in the latter.

Knowledge is the purview of the analytical left brain;
understanding draws on the intuitive right brain to
make sense of that knowledge.
We urge teachers to seek ways to incorporate intuition in their curriculum, as it is a critical characteristic of a fine engineer. In assembling and evaluating
“big data,” for example—where it is hard to know all
the details, and the outcomes may not feel right even
though the data and the processes or theories appear
correct—it is important to heed one’s intuition to perform “fallacy” checks. Attention to intuitive instincts
can prevent big mistakes from big data.
Young engineers need to learn the arts, to trust their
intuition, and to listen, in order to understand and artfully apply their engineering knowledge to solve the
problems they confront.
Opportunities to Impart Good Character and
the Freedom to Fail

The New York Times, in the Education issue of its magazine in September 2011, ran an article entitled “What
if the Secret to Success Is Failure?” (Tough 2011). The
article discussed the joint endeavors of two headmasters, one at a rich, white private school and the other at
a low-income, largely black and Latino private school.
Their goal was to get their students into top-tier colleges, keep them there, and prepare them for life. After
looking at test scores, IQ, and the like, both headmasters concluded that what they needed in their curriculum was the “science of good character.”

<-----Page 30----->SUMMER 2013

In seeking to define “good character,” 24 character
strengths were identified as important and common to
all cultures and times. The list includes bravery, citizenship, fairness, wisdom, and integrity; emotional aspects
such as love, humor, zest, and appreciation of beauty;
traits related to social intelligence, described as the
ability to recognize interpersonal dynamics and adapt
quickly to different social situations; and kindness, selfregulation, and gratitude—values emphasized in many
religious traditions.
What was so interesting in this article was that students who persisted in college were not necessarily the
ones who had excelled academically. They were the
ones with exceptional character strengths, like optimism and persistence and social intelligence. They
were the ones who could recover from a bad grade and
vow to do better next time and get extra help after class
to improve.
People who accomplished great things often combined a
passion for a single mission with an unswerving dedication to achieve that mission, whatever the obstacles and
however long it might take. . . . [T]his quality [is called]
“grit.” (Tough 2011)

The article goes on to observe that
we have an acute, almost biological impulse to provide
for our children, to give them everything they want and
need, to protect them from dangers and discomforts,
both large and small. And yet…what kids need more
than anything is a little hardship: some challenge, some
deprivation that they can overcome, even if just to prove
to themselves that they can. (Tough 2011)

If they can, parents protect their children from experiencing failure for many reasons, but usually to be helpful and minimize their pain and suffering. But protecting
students and children from failure does not make them
smarter or stronger: it disables them and undermines
their personal growth and the development of responsibility. Quoting one of the headmasters,
The idea of building grit and building self-control is that
you get that through failure, and in most highly academic environments in the United States, no one fails
anything. (Tough 2011)

Thus the engineering student with a score of 800 on
the math SAT and straight As in math and science may
not be the best student for either academic success or
long-term contributions to society. Academic skill must
be enhanced by character and relationship skills. Defi-

29

ciencies in both academic and human knowledge may
be overcome through thoughtful education, hard work,
and persistence.
It is easier to teach knowledge than it is to change
someone’s character. But a good engineer in the 21st
century needs both.
Conclusion

Engineering faces serious challenges, and education
is a pathway toward solving them, especially if new
methods of teaching and learning are evaluated with
an open mind.
The Next Generation Science Standards put greater
K–12 emphasis on STEM and for the first time add
engineering to a national education standard. As engineers, we should support implementation of these new
standards at the state level and locally.
The Internet can contribute to cost-effective
instruction for both teachers and students, but teachers
play the most critical role in student learning through
their encouragement, example, companionship, and
knowledge.
Engineering education should train students to work
effectively in groups, through collaboration and the
development of interpersonal relationships. Good
engineers also need to have character—integrity,
social intelligence, and grit—and the ability to trust
their intuition. These character traits and skills can be
taught and learned through discipline, example, and
opportunity, and will lead to more effective engineers
with a more productive and fulfilling life.

ndustry and society depend on engineers for the design and production of
goods that meet customer needs and are safe, reliable, efficient, and competitive in the global market. Given the dynamics of the global economy
and changing US age demographics (specifically, in this context, the large
number of engineers approaching retirement), much has been written about
whether there will be a sufficient number of engineers to meet industry and
societal needs.
Furthermore, although colleges and universities produce technically competent graduates who understand engineering concepts and demonstrate the
ability to apply them in the real world, they often lack the people skills (also
called “soft” skills) that enable them to meet their full potential. Today’s
engineers need to be not only technically strong but also creative and able
to work well in teams, communicate effectively, and create products that are
useful in the “real world.”
Industry, society, and engineering schools can—and should—collaborate
to ensure a sufficient number of such qualified and capable engineers to
meet industry and society needs. In this article I discuss measures to achieve
these goals.

Engineering Education and Employment:
Recent Facts and Figures

The road to an engineering degree has long been characterized by challenging courses, a heavy course load,
long hours of study, and high failure rates. It was not
uncommon for some of the best and brightest who
entered engineering school to drop their pursuit of an
engineering degree and move to an easier course of
study. Some even dropped out of college altogether. In
2011 it was reported that 40–60 percent of science and
engineering majors change their major because “it’s just
so darn hard” (Drew 2011).

Engineering graduates
often lack the people skills
(also called “soft” skills) that
enable them to meet their
full potential.
The good news is that, notwithstanding these facts
and figures, the United States has actually seen a recent
increase in the number of undergraduate engineering degrees. From 2003 to 2009 the annual number of
engineers graduating from US colleges and universities
remained relatively flat (degrees awarded rose by only
3,000 during those seven years, from 71,000 to 74,000;
Yoder 2012). But in 2010 there was a jump of 4,000, to
78,000 new degrees, and in 2011 another jump of 5,000,
to 83,000.1
Moreover, the unemployment rate for engineers is
just 2 percent (Gearon 2012), even as the national rate
has averaged 9 percent since 2009.2 Even when national
unemployment was nearly 10 percent, the unemployment rate for engineers peaked at 6.4 percent. In addition, the highest-paying salary for a new college graduate
1

These recent dramatic increases correlate with general undergraduate enrollment growth that began early in the decade. After
remaining flat at about 375,000 between 2003 and 2006, undergraduate enrollment in 2007 began a steady rise, with an average annual increase of more than 22,000 students, bringing total
undergraduate enrollment in 2011 to 471,000 (Yoder 2012).

2 Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, available online at
http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000.

in 2013 is in engineering, with an average starting salary
of $62,535 (up 4 percent from 2012) and starting salaries as high as $93,500 (NACE 2013). And since only 5
percent of all undergraduates complete an engineering
degree (Newman 2012), there is substantial demand.
With low unemployment, excellent salaries, and
rewarding work, why is industry concerned that there
won’t be enough qualified engineers to meet its needs?
Why is it that many students see engineering as a difficult degree to achieve? And what can be done to
address these concerns?
The Importance of Soft Skills

There are at least two significant areas for enhancement
in engineering education to address the concerns cited
above:
1.	ensuring that engineering students can not only
achieve their degree objectives but also apply their
skills in the real world, and
2.	increasing graduation rates for students pursuing
engineering degrees.
It turns out that progress in both areas requires the
development and use of soft skills. In fact, many in business have observed that the factors that improve graduation rates are the same as those that support success in
industry.
There are few reports from industry that students don’t
have the right technical competency to succeed—the
engineering school accreditation process has ensured
the acquisition of technical competencies. Rather, engineering majors who fail in industry are those who have
all the right technical competencies but not the soft
or people skills to be successful. Specifically, they tend
to lack the ability to work well in teams, communicate
effectively, define problems, and consider alternative
and creative solutions. They also tend to rely too heavily on digital tools in their efforts to develop solutions
that can be delivered in the real world.
Four Measures to Develop Engineering
Students’ Soft Skills

To address the need for students to acquire soft skills,
many engineering school deans have enlisted the help
of industry and technology leaders to understand the
factors associated with soft skill development. These
deans have created an environment that fosters the
development of students’ soft skills through their work
in teams, on hands-on projects, and in industry, all as
part of an engineering curriculum that is already achiev-

<-----Page 34----->SUMMER 2013

ing excellent results. Following are four examples of
such measures.
Assignment of New Students to Cohorts

As mentioned, engineering students face the challenges of a demanding curriculum, long study hours, and a
high course load. These are particularly daunting for
first-year students, most of whom must also adapt to the
challenge of being away from home for the first time and
being responsible for more than just their academics.
One successful model for helping students not only
cope but also thrive involves assigning a cohort of up to 50
students to an engineering professor, preferably one who
teaches an engineering introductory course and is clearly
interested in the students’ success. The cohort provides
an environment for students to develop relationships
with others who are experiencing the same challenges,
and it ensures that a professor monitors their progress and
can quickly address issues that may arise. Early evidence
indicates that students who have such additional oversight and support move from the at-risk population (at
risk of quitting their engineering studies or of dropping
out altogether) to successful first-year students.
Engineering Professors Teaching Mathematics and Physics

Two of the most challenging courses for new engineering
students are the introductory mathematics and physics
courses. Some colleges and universities have considered
them “weed-out” courses for engineering majors. But as
colleges are in a position to select the best and brightest
students from the many who apply, courses designed to
cut out underachievers are no longer warranted.
For most engineering students, understanding and
applying mathematical concepts is critical to their success in the classroom and eventually in the workplace.
(And as one with an undergraduate degree in mathematics, I also appreciate the elegance that the field
can bring to engineering.) A number of engineering
schools have enlisted engineering professors to teach
mathematics and physics, using real-world engineering examples to translate mathematical concepts into
practice. The approach is associated with significant
improvement in student performance and thus better
retention and degree attainment rates.3
3 While

some have claimed that ABET requires mathematics and
physics to be taught by the professors from those fields, engineering deans who have adopted the approach of engineering professors teaching math and physics indicate that it has not affected
their ABET accreditation.

33

First- and Second-Year Engineering Student Projects

Engineers want to solve problems. At many schools,
however, the approach has been to use the first two
years of the engineering curriculum to ensure that students have a solid foundation of concepts and practices
before they get to solve problems.
Fortunately, colleges are finding that engaging firstyear engineering students in hands-on projects bolsters
retention and performance. One obvious option is the
involvement of these early undergraduates in supporting graduate students and their projects. In addition,
strong relationships in the community and with industry can provide opportunities to engage first-year students. For example, Columbia University works with
the community to identify and define projects for firstyear students, who work in teams to develop soft skills,
are able to use their newly learned engineering tools,
solve problems for “customers,” and begin their transformation from student to engineer in a way that is very
useful to industry.

The use of real-world
engineering examples to
translate mathematical
concepts into practice
significantly increases
student success rates.
Internships

Like student projects, internships have become a critical tool for preparing students for the workforce. One
model that is gaining traction is to work with students
to line up internships after their second year in engineering school. Duke University makes it a point to
meet with second-year students to ensure that they are
taking the right steps to participate in an internship,
and then discuss the experience with them afterward to
get feedback on how it went.
For many students, an internship is their first real
experience with industry and their first opportunity to
see what it means to be a practicing engineer in the field
they are pursuing. If the internship experience is good,
then the student continues in the selected field of study.

<-----Page 35----->The

BRIDGE

34

If, however, an electrical engineering student decides
after the internship to become a civil engineer instead,
there is time to refocus her studies.
Internships are also an opportunity for colleges and
industry to work closer together. Experience at the Boeing Company showed that those with internships are far
more successful as employees. The internships also provide a way to observe potential employee performance
as well as get real-time feedback from students. As a
measure of Boeing’s confidence in the benefits of these
engineering internships, the company recently doubled
the number available from 600 to 1,200.
Conclusion

The four measures described above are just a sampling of
options, but colleges and universities where engineering
school leaders and faculty have implemented them (or
measures similar to them) have seen steady increases in
student retention and graduation rates. For example, at
Duke, Columbia, Olin, and the University of Southern California, 85 percent of entering engineering students graduate with engineering degrees—a dramatic
improvement over the figures cited in the New York
Times article (Drew 2011).
These schools show that creating opportunities for
students to engage as engineers makes a huge difference
in their graduation rates and ensures that they meet the
needs of industry. Students with access to such program
enhancements do not drop out because “it’s so darn
hard” because, although they face the same challenges
as their peers in other college or university engineering
programs, they receive critical support and early opportunities to develop both engineering and people skills.

The key to ensuring that engineering graduates are
ready for the future rests in how they are educated,
which must involve more than the right technical content. An effective education in engineering must also
include development of soft skills. Programs that cultivate both demonstrate high retention and graduation
rates that also ensure students become employees that
design and help produce goods that are safe, reliable,
efficient, and competitive in the global market. Industry
and engineering schools working closely together with
students in a true partnership make it happen.
These are great examples and a strong start, but there
is more to do. Tracking and reporting (1) the number
of internships that businesses provide and (2) engineering school retention and graduation rates will go a long
way toward enhancing accountability and continuing to
achieve the results needed for US engineering students,
industry, and the national economy.

t is an exciting time to be an engineer. In recent decades, the engineering workforce has helped the United States make substantial advances in
communications, health, defense, infrastructure, and manufacturing (Blue
et al. 2005), and the time between the emergence of new technologies and
their implementation has steadily declined (Kurzweil 2001). Opportunities

Ongoing innovation is required to address pressing
problems and to maintain America’s global competitiveness, and engineering is the foundation of much
of that innovation. To be prepared to enter the workforce and thrive in this ever changing global economy,
engineers need to be able to collaborate effectively as
leaders, in teams, and with their peers. In addition to
their technical and analytical expertise, they need to
be flexible, resilient, creative, empathetic, and have the
ability to recognize and seize opportunities (NAE 2004;
Sheppard et al. 2008). All of these skills can and should
be taught to engineers as part of their formal education.
It is thus the responsibility of engineering educators to
instill these qualities in students to enable them to be
more innovative and entrepreneurial.

It is the responsibility of
engineering educators
to teach their students to
be more innovative and
entrepreneurial.
In this article, we examine the importance of entrepreneurship efforts in engineering education, national
support for entrepreneurship, student and faculty attitudes and engagement, noteworthy programs, and early
research on these initiatives. We then offer our perspective on the future landscape for innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering education.
The Importance of Entrepreneurship Education

It is no longer enough to come out of school with a purely
technical education; engineers need to be entrepreneurial in order to understand and contribute in the context of market and business pressures. For engineers who
start companies soon after graduation, entrepreneurship
education gives them solid experience in product design
and development, prototyping, technology trends, and
market analysis (Nelson and Byers 2010). These skills
are just as relevant for success in established enterprises
as they are in startups; students with entrepreneurial
training who join established firms are better prepared
to become effective team members and managers and
can better support their employers as innovators.

Entrepreneurship education teaches engineering students in all disciplines the knowledge, tools, and attitudes that are required to identify opportunities and
bring them to life. Students who take part in entrepreneurship programs as undergraduates gain insights not
available from traditional engineering education, such
as understanding and designing for end users (“empathy”), working in and managing interdisciplinary teams,
communicating effectively, thinking critically, understanding business basics, and solving open-ended problems (ABET 1995; NAE 2004).
Expanding Support for Entrepreneurship

In many universities, entrepreneurship is no longer
confined to business schools. In fact, it is one of the
fastest growing subjects in undergraduate education
overall, with formal programs such as majors, minors,
and certificates quadrupling from 1975 to 2006 (Brooks
et al. 2007).
And interest in entrepreneurship extends beyond
higher education. In recent decades, technology entrepreneurs have become American heroes, and the entrepreneurial process has been embraced as a key element
of the country’s future success and global leadership.
The White House has emphasized entrepreneurship as
a means of driving innovation: in addition to improving
STEM education, President Obama’s strategy for American innovation calls for an investment in high-growth
and innovation-based entrepreneurship to drive the US
economy (NEC 2011).
The National Science Foundation has also invested
in entrepreneurship and innovation with programs
such as Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which prepares
scientists and engineers to consider broader opportunities for their technology and research, and the
National Center for Engineering Pathways to Innovation (Epicenter). Managed by Stanford University
and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators
Alliance (NCIIA), Epicenter was established in 2011
to expand the infusion of entrepreneurship into undergraduate engineering education. It sponsors initiatives
that inspire engineering students to envision possibilities and create viable, innovative products, services,
and processes.1

Student and Faculty Attitudes toward
Entrepreneurship Education

Unlike other changes to the engineering curriculum
that have been implemented with little student input,
there is substantial and growing student demand for
entrepreneurship education. In an annual survey of
American college freshmen, 41 percent of respondents
said that “becoming successful in a business of my own”
is an objective they considered “essential” or “very
important” (Pryor et al. 2012). In a study of engineering students by Duval-Couetil and colleagues (2012),
two-thirds of the respondents agreed that entrepreneurship education would broaden their career prospects
and choices.
Among faculty and administrators, according to a
recent ASEE survey, about 50 percent of respondents
reported that access to entrepreneurship programs is
important for their engineering undergraduates (Peterfreund 2013). While this might be interpreted as a
discouraging statistic for the expansion of entrepreneurship in education, we view it as an opportunity.
Working with faculty members will help the Epicenter team understand their points of view and give us
tools for influencing others. For example, it may be that
some faculty members do not have experience in entrepreneurship and do not really understand it (Zappe et
al. 2013). For others, it may be that their perception
of their students’ needs and challenges puts entrepreneurship low on the priority list of learning objectives.
Furthermore, survey findings suggest that faculty perceptions about overcrowded engineering curriculum,
and their belief that faculty peers and administrators
are unsupportive of including entrepreneurial learning objectives in engineering education, contribute to
making these objectives a low priority for engineering
undergraduate programs (Peterfreund 2013).
Both in and outside the classroom, learning to be an
entrepreneur requires a complex set of knowledge, skills,
and abilities (Nelson and Byers 2010). The recent work
of Zappe and colleagues (2013), which examined the
beliefs of faculty who teach entrepreneurship to engineering students, is a first step toward understanding
faculty perspectives on entrepreneurial skills and codifying, organizing, and advancing engineering undergraduate entrepreneurial learning objectives. Their
study found that educators who teach entrepreneurship
to engineering students believe that:
•	 The defining characteristic for an entrepreneur
is the ability to act on opportunities. Other key

37

characteristics are drive, passion, resourcefulness,
and the belief that one can be successful.
•	 The characteristics of an entrepreneurial mindset can
be learned, including the ability to act on opportunities, learn from failures, and solve problems, as well as
technical, business, interpersonal, and communication skills.
•	 The way educators teach entrepreneurship is deeply
influenced by their own career experiences as well as
their beliefs about how people become entrepreneurs.
Understanding the beliefs of those who currently
teach entrepreneurship is useful in defining the educational outcomes for entrepreneurial learning. These
beliefs also suggest that more work is needed to enhance
understanding of the relationships between teaching
strategies, personal experience with entrepreneurship,
and effectiveness in achieving learning outcomes.

About half of faculty and
administrators report that
access to entrepreneurship
programs is important for their
engineering undergraduates.
Faculty Engagement and Impacts

The integration of entrepreneurship and innovation in
engineering education will require a shift in thinking
and willingness on the part of faculty to participate in, or
at least accept changes in, the engineering curriculum.
Recent experiences in introducing new approaches to
engineering education are a good indicator of the challenges and a guide to which approaches will be effective.
In a study of adoption of several major educational
innovations in engineering education, Borrego and colleagues (2010) found that a combination of approaches was needed to build awareness, support practical
adoption, and enable institutionalization. Developing
well-defined and proven materials is necessary but not
sufficient. Best practices and training opportunities need
to be complemented by awareness and buy-in among
faculty and administrators, and the provision of resources and incentives for implementation. Importantly, the
highest adoption rates were found for innovations that

<-----Page 39----->The

BRIDGE

38

could be implemented by individuals or small teams
without a great deal of departmental coordination.
Engaging traditional engineering faculty is, however,
only part of the picture, since many of those who teach
entrepreneurship are clinical, adjunct, or nontraditional
faculty. Therefore, curricular and noncurricular program
development needs to take account of the advantages
and challenges in terms of a school’s faculty makeup.
Models of Engineering Entrepreneurship
Education

A mixture of approaches to entrepreneurship education
is necessary to deliver the experiences and knowledge
that lead to innovative and entrepreneurial graduates.
Fortunately, with high interest in entrepreneurship
among students, there is an opportunity to catalyze
student awareness and interest through short, engaging experiences. To that end, Epicenter is building on
the success of NCIIA’s Invention to Venture workshops

Successful student innovators
become powerful role models
for their classmates.
by training and deploying “student ambassadors” at a
number of institutions, where they hold events, run
competitions, and exemplify the path toward becoming an innovator.
Also key will be thinking in new ways about how to
approach entrepreneurship education. Some engineering schools have formal certificate and minors programs
in entrepreneurship for their undergraduates, and 50 percent of faculty respondents to the ASEE survey reported
that extracurricular programs are a prevalent means for
engineering students to gain experience in entrepreneurship (Peterfreund 2013). The proportion of students
participating in these experiences is still small, but their
impact on the participating students and in inspiring
their peers is important. Successful student innovators
become powerful role models for their classmates.
Neck and Greene (2011) call for expanding concepts of teaching entrepreneurship from a process-based
approach with known inputs and outputs to a methodsbased approach that supports iteration and creativity.
Others are thinking about the incorporation of entrepreneurship modules in which engineering problem solving

takes place in the context of a business opportunity.
The emergence of online learning resources has been
particularly useful for delivering digital content both
in and out of the classroom. For instance, the Stanford
Technology Ventures Program’s Entrepreneurship Corner (ECorner) offers thousands of video clips that are
easily incorporated in classroom discussions, student
research, and presentations. Epicenter is building on the
success of ECorner and creating small learning modules
with entrepreneurship-related content. Online courses
on entrepreneurship also allow faculty and students
far removed from vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems
to access a wide range of instructors and content, and
enable faculty to spend more time nurturing innovation.
Another high-impact approach involves creating
intensive entrepreneurship programs and experiences
for highly motivated students. Successful examples
include the University of Texas at Austin’s Idea to Product (I2P) competition, the NCIIA’s E-Team program for
launching student ventures, and a growing number of
entrepreneurship-themed “living-learning” communities (combining student residence with curricular and
extracurricular activities) at universities around the
country (Inkelas et al. 2008). Students report that these
programs put their engineering education in context
and provide opportunities to learn about leadership in
emerging and existing enterprises.
It is also important to explore commonalities between
entrepreneurial skills and ABET guidelines to see how
entrepreneurship can fulfill key ABET requirements.
Alignment with these requirements can influence university leaders who are motivated to maintain their
ABET accreditation.
Analysis of Existing Programs

A number of engineering schools have already made
significant investments in programs to help their
undergraduate students become skilled in entrepreneurship, and the recent work of Besterfield-Sacre and
colleagues (2011; Shartrand et al. 2010) is an important step toward comprehensive analysis of such courses
and programs in the United States. Their preliminary
study found that the primary differentiators among
these programs are “density of offerings” (coursework,
extracurricular activities, minors/certificates, concen2 The

<-----Page 40----->SUMMER 2013

trations, and entrepreneurship majors), Carnegie Classification,2 and physical and virtual spaces dedicated
to entrepreneurial activities (incubators or business
accelerators, web portals for campus resources, entrepreneurship research institutes, and design and prototyping spaces).
Building on this research, Epicenter has launched a
study of 41 engineering schools that offer certificates or
minors in entrepreneurship. The schools range in size
from very small (13 engineering bachelor’s degrees per
year) to large (more than 1,700 such degrees). Some programs are housed in the engineering department or school
(e.g., University of Pennsylvania), some are offered by
the business school to students across the entire campus
(e.g., University of Connecticut), and still others are
partnerships between departments such as engineering
and business (e.g., Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute).
A primary aim of the Epicenter study is to develop
a multifaceted analysis of these offerings as a resource.
Those who are designing entrepreneurship programs
will be able to build on the models and experiences
of others and to engage the larger engineering education community in discussions about how and why to
include entrepreneurship in engineering education.
Looking Ahead

There is reason to be optimistic about the potential for
infusing opportunities for entrepreneurship and innovation into engineering education. The NSF, NAE, and
other engineering education supporters have invested
significantly in spurring innovation in engineering education, and a growing field of engineering education
researchers is studying and documenting what works,
how, and why. Coupled with a well-supported approach
that empowers faculty across the nation and engages
both institutional leaders and accreditation bodies, this
change is under way.
To continue building a movement to create more
entrepreneurial engineers, we urge stakeholders in
undergraduate engineering education to consider the
following questions and actions.
Students: Ask questions of your professors, administrators, and fellow students. Where does entrepreneurship fit into the educational picture at your school?
What opportunities already exist for you? How can you
help build more opportunities?
Engineering faculty: Consider the role of entrepreneurship in all facets of your work, from teaching to
research. How might the subjects you teach connect

39

to engineering and business practice? How might your
students benefit from seeing this larger context for their
technical learning?
Academic administrators: Talk with your faculty,
students, and alumni about their attitudes about entrepreneurship. How have elements of entrepreneurship
and innovation added to their professional success?
How might additional training in these elements contribute to future success?
Industry leaders and representatives: Reflect on
how your operations use engineers with an entrepreneurial approach and mindset. How can you engage
academic program faculty in discussions about the key
entrepreneurial skills and abilities you need in your
engineering workforce?
Beginning these conversations with your peers and
other stakeholders can expose connections between
motivated individuals and groups and yield opportunities for expanding the innovative and entrepreneurial
ecosystem at your institution. With the growing support
of entrepreneurship in the engineering community, we
are confident that 21st century engineering graduates
can and will be equipped with the ability to address the
challenges of the coming decades in innovative and
economically generative ways.

he clamor surrounding the high cost, limited access, static nature, and
often low quality of the world’s education systems is reaching a crescendo.
Many observers claim a serious threat to the future of youth, the training of
workforces worldwide, and even the democratic process. In addition, education is out of reach for many in the developing world, widening the gap
between rich and poor people and countries.
The statistics are alarming. As Figure 1 shows, since 1978 textbook costs
in the United States have risen 812 percent, more than three times the
consumer price index (Perry 2012). No wonder that US student debt has
topped $1 trillion and that a recent California study found that 7 out of
10 college students now choose not to purchase textbooks (Redden 2011).
Adjusted for inflation, tuition costs at US colleges rose over 25 percent in
the past decade. Besides cost, there is also the challenge of inadequate educational facilities. At a South African university in 2012, 11,000 desperate
applicants vying for 800 openings induced a stampede that left one person
dead and 22 injured.
Now imagine a world that has forestalled this crisis: a world where textbooks and other learning materials are free for all on the web and low-cost
in print, adapted to many backgrounds and learning styles, interactive and
immersive, translated into numerous languages, continually updated and corrected, and never out of print. A world where computers assist in teaching so

goods and services (designated Consumer Price Index in the graph)—as well as the median price for

that instructors can spend more time teaching concepts
and values, giving insights, and providing inspiration.
A world where courses can be taken from anywhere at
any hour of the day or night. A world where a student
study group encircles the globe. A world of “living” (i.e.,
constantly updatable) certifications and degrees that
continuously document students’ and lifelong learners’
accomplishments.
While this world was just a dream even a decade ago,
the open education (OE) movement that aims to create
it is coalescing and gaining momentum. The movement
is based on a set of intuitions shared by a remarkably
wide range of academics and students: knowledge
should be free and open to use and reuse; collaboration
should be easier, not harder; and people should receive
credit for what they’ve learned and demonstrated.
The OE movement is rapidly gaining momentum
because of a “perfect storm” comprising two converging factors. First, the global financial downturn is forcing education systems worldwide to dramatically reduce
costs on every front by updating their business models.
Second, powerful telecommunication and information
technologies are providing new, cost-effective ways to
distribute content, support personal interactions, and
store information.

In this article I describe
developments on four fronts
that promise to reinvent
the way educators produce
and disseminate educational materials and fundamentally change students’
relationship with content.
These four “frontline” areas
are textbooks, courses, personalized learning, and certification.
While the timescale of
education transformation
has until now been measured in decades, even centuries, OE has the potential
to radically alter the way
authors, instructors, and
students interact worldwide
virtually overnight.
Open Textbooks

The textbook was the
answer to the educational challenges of the 19th century, but it is the bottleneck of the 21st century. The
textbook of today is static, linear in organization, timeconsuming to develop, soon out of date, and expensive.
Moreover, it provides only “one-size-fits-all” learning
that doesn’t cater to the background, interests, abilities,
and goals of individual students.
Open Educational Resources

Communication and information technologies provide
a golden opportunity to reinvent the textbook. Open
educational resources (OER) include text, images,
audio, video, interactive simulations, problems and
answers, and games that are free to use and reuse in new
ways by anyone around the world. The key elements of
OER are:
•	 open copyright licenses, like those of Creative Commons, that turn educational materials into living
objects that can be continuously developed, remixed,
and maintained by a worldwide community of authors
and editors; and
•	 information technologies, like the Internet and web,
that enable easy digital content reorganization and
virtually free content distribution.

<-----Page 44----->SUMMER 2013

The OER approach to textbooks has several important benefits:
•	 It brings people back into the educational equation.
Those who have been “shut out” of the traditional
publishing world—talented K–12 teachers, community college instructors, and scientists and engineers
in industry—can add tremendous diversity and depth
to the educational experience.
•	 It reduces the high cost of teaching materials. In many
states, college students now spend more on textbooks
than tuition.
•	 It reduces the time lag between the production of
learning materials and their delivery to students.
Many books are out of date by the time they are printed. This is particularly problematic in fast-moving
areas of engineering, science, and medicine.
•	 It enables reuse, recontextualization, and customization such as translation and localization of course
materials in myriad languages and cultures. This step
is critical for reaching the entire world’s population,
where clearly one size does not fit all for education.
“Connexions” at Rice University

Several OER projects are already attracting millions
of users per month. Some, like MIT OpenCourseWare
(ocw.mit.edu), are top-down-organized institutional
repositories that showcase their institutions’ curricula.
Others, like Wikipedia, are grassroots organized and
encourage contributions from all comers.
In addition, there is Connexions (cnx.org), which I
founded in 1999 with three primary goals: (1) to convey the interconnected nature of knowledge across disciplines, courses, and curricula; (2) to move away from
a solitary authoring, publishing, and learning process to
one based on connecting people in open, global learning
communities that share knowledge; and (3) to support
personalized learning (more on this below). Connexions has grown into one of the largest and most used
OER platforms—each month millions of users access
over 20,000 educational “building blocks” and 1300
e-textbooks (as of April 2013). In addition to web and
e-book outputs, a sophisticated print-on-demand system
enables the production of inexpensive paper books for
those who prefer or need them, at a fraction of the cost
of books from a conventional publisher.
Content contributions come from all over the
world in more than 40 languages, including Spanish,

43

Chinese, Vietnamese, and Afrikaans. In South Africa,
Siyavula (cnx.org/lenses/siyavula), a nonprofit resource
for technology-powered learning based in Cape Town,
is developing a complete K–12 curriculum. Vietnam
is using Connexions as a faculty development tool
(voer.edu.vn). Professional societies such as the IEEE
are advancing their global educational outreach and
inreach through content development and peer review
(ieeecnx.org; Kelty et al. 2008). Indeed, because the
Connexions founders and early adopters were signal
processing faculty and IEEE members, there is a strong
extant signal processing foundation to build on.
To help busy college instructors adopt OER and save
students money, Connexions recently partnered with
a consortium of philanthropic foundations to launch
OpenStax College (openstaxcollege.org) to provide free
textbooks for today’s highest-impact college courses.
Textbooks are authored by professional domain experts
and peer reviewed by practicing college instructors, and
the library also offers lecture slides, image libraries, and
test banks.

Open educational resources
(OER) include text, images,
audio, video, interactive
simulations, problems, and
games that are free for
anyone to use.
The initial reaction to the project has been very positive. As of April 2013, more than 150 institutions had
formally adopted the library’s College Physics, Introduction to Sociology, Biology, and Concepts of Biology texts.
College Physics now exceeds 3 percent market share. On
an annual basis, more than 23,000 students are saving
more than $2.3 million. When completed, every year
the initial 25-book OpenStax College library will benefit over 1.2 million students at a 10 percent market
share, saving students an estimated $120 million. Compared to the philanthropic investment required to build
the library, the return on investment in terms of student
savings is approximately 600 percent per year. And a
number of planned translation/localization projects aim
to make a further global impact.

Open Courses

A student transported from 1900 to the present would
feel quite at home in one of today’s typical lecture
courses. Lectures remain a primarily passive experience
of copying down what an instructor says and writes on
a board (or projects on a screen). Such “teaching by
telling” is effective for conveying information, but ineffective for imparting knowledge and actively engaging
students.
Communication and information technologies make
it possible to do much more. Schools have offered distance learning courses for decades. New technologies
now make it straightforward to replace in-person lectures with YouTube videos, paper-based homework with
web pages, and graders with computer algorithms. OE
is taking the concept even further by opening access to
any student, anywhere.
The Khan Academy (khanacademy.org) advanced
OE by demonstrating the power of freely distributed
short (10-minute) videos of mini-lectures and worked
problems, thus enabling students anywhere to learn a
new subject, solidify their understanding, or clear up
their misconceptions. Moreover, the videos enable
teachers to “flip the classroom” by having students view
the lecture materials online on their own and then using
valuable class time to discuss and work problems. The
flipped classroom aligns with the philosophy of Confucius, who famously remarked: “I hear and I forget. I see
and I remember. I do and I understand.”

guages, and more than 23,000 students completed the
course. Adding a human element to the course, thousands of study groups formed spontaneously via social
networking sites, some grounded locally and others distributed globally.
The success of this initial experiment spawned a
menage of educational MOOC enterprises, such as the
for-profit Coursera, Udacity, and Google CourseBuilder
and the nonprofit edX and Class2Go. A related enterprise is TED-Ed, a new education arm of the successful
TED franchise that enables the remix of video lectures
(not unlike the work of Connexions with textbooks).
Like OER, MOOCs democratize access to high-quality learning experiences and provide a large and widespread potential audience for enterprising instructors.
They also enable students to form long-lasting social
bonds with students from around the world, which
bodes well for the increasingly global economy. The
ability to replay online course material as many times
as needed makes it possible to move away from competition in education (competition for access to courses, for the instructor’s time, against each other due to
curve-based grading) toward a world where everyone
eventually masters the material and gets a good grade.
Finally, MOOCs and other online courses will afford an
unprecedented opportunity to observe and analyze student learning experiences, and the resulting quantities
of data can be used to improve and eventually personalize the learning process.
Personalized Learning

Massive online open courses
(MOOCs) open up access
by transporting lectures,
examples, homework, tests,
and office hours to the web.
Massive open online courses (MOOCs) take this
concept a step further by transporting all the components of a course—not just lectures and examples, but
also homework, tests, and office hours—to the web and
opening up access to all. The canonical success story of
a MOOC is Stanford University’s fall 2011 Artificial
Intelligence course that enrolled over 160,000 students
from 190 countries. Volunteers translated it into 44 lan-

At all levels of education, students typically receive
instruction and activities as a group, regardless of differences in aptitude, prior knowledge, motivation, or
interest. This one-size-fits-all approach forces students
into artificial timelines for learning that often cause
them to become bored or fall behind. Recent advances
in technology provide the opportunity to revolutionize
education by gathering data on student learning interactions and using the information to tailor instruction
and activities to the needs and characteristics of each
student in order to maximize learning outcomes.1

personalized learning has built on a content-centric

•	 Machine learning. We increase the flexibility, generalizability, and scalability of OpenStax Tutor by
eschewing hand-coded rule-based systems for providing feedback in favor of data-driven machine learning algorithms that adapt and optimize feedback
and learning plans by analyzing the content, problems, and solutions plus data from a large number of
learner interactions. For example, Figure 2 illustrates
a concept graph that was automatically generated
by a sparse factor analysis (SPARFA) learning/content analytics algorithm using only the course “grade
book” matrix indicating which students answered
which questions (in)correctly (Lan et al. 2012).
In beta testing, Rice University electrical and computer engineering students who used OpenStax Tutor
during the 2011–12 academic year improved their
learning outcomes by one-half to one letter grade compared to those who relied on the standard practice of
weekly homework without retrieval practice, spacing,
and timely feedback. Beta testing is continuing with
engineering students at Rice, Georgia Tech, the University of Texas at El Paso, and the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (Terre Haute, Indiana).
Personalized learning systems like OpenStax Tutor
can both enhance the learning experience for students
and provide college instructors and K–12 teachers
with immediate data to better inform their instruction and forge a more direct connection with their
students. They enable teachers to immediately understand not only how their students are performing on
the core course concepts but also what they are doing
that influences their students’ success (and failures) in
their learning. Significantly more efficient and effective
learning should result.
Credit and Open Certification

OER and MOOCs enable flexible new ways to learn,
but how do students (of any age) get credit for what
they’ve learned? Today, in order to get credit, one typically enrolls in a rigid, often multiyear program that
measures learning achievement in terms of “seat time.”
Such rigidity is no longer practical in the modern
knowledge economy, as more and more careers require
constant training on new knowledge and skills. As John
Seely Brown (2005, p. 4.3) put it, “As [workers] move
from career to career, much of what they will need to
learn won’t be what they learned in school a decade
earlier. They will have to be able to pick up new skills
outside of today’s traditional educational institution.”

Clearly, students and lifelong learners need a more
flexible system for certifying their skills acquired both in
and out of school. Again, communication and information technologies offer a solution.
Recently developed “stacked credentials” record and
track learning achievements in subjects such as web
design, welding, and calculus. In particular, Mozilla’s
Open Badges project (mozilla.org/badges) has developed tools to make it easy to earn, issue, and display
“badges” (a simple kind of credential) on the web. Badges allow people to provide a more complete picture of
their skills and competencies to potential employers,
mentors, peers, and collaborators. They acknowledge
the fact that learning happens everywhere (not just in
school) and document much more than a report card
about people’s acquired skills and competencies. The
beauty of badges is that, like OER, they are modular
and thus enable learners to build a career ladder over
time, transforming the learner from a passive consumer
in a constrained system to an active participant in a
lifelong process.
MOOC and badge-based certification are nascent
but gaining momentum, as illustrated in the following
examples:
•	 The major MOOC providers all offer a certificate of
accomplishment for students who successfully complete their courses online.
•	 The American Council on Education is reviewing
MOOCs offered by several elite universities and may
recommend that other colleges grant credit for them
(Young 2012).
•	 Industry associations, such as the Manufacturing
Institute, are developing badges that recognize skills
highly sought after by manufacturers.
•	 Peer-to-Peer University (p2pu.org), a grassroots
OE project, is offering badges for the completion of
online courses.
The Open Road Ahead

The world is increasingly connected, yet educational systems cling to the disconnected past. The OE movement
provides new mechanisms to democratize education by
interconnecting ideas, learners, and instructors in new
kinds of constructs that replace traditional textbooks,
courses, and certifications. OE has the potential to realize the dream of providing not only universal access to
all the world’s knowledge but also the tools required to

<-----Page 48----->SUMMER 2013

acquire it. The result will be a revolutionary advance in
the world’s standard of education at all levels.
But OE is also a disruptive force in the academic world
(Christensen and Horn 2011). OER promises to disintermediate the scholarly publishing industry, rendering
some current business models unviable and inventing
new viable ones. Furthermore, MOOCs, badges, and
personalized learning systems have the potential to disaggregate schools and colleges, enabling new efficiencies but also devaluing certain aspects.
Thus, however exciting, the OE movement raises
many questions, most of them revolving around ways to
maximize the impact of OE while mitigating undesired,
unintended consequences. Research and experience are
needed to address the following questions:
•	 What measures may be necessary to prevent OE from
“regressing to the mean” and providing only an average education to an average student?
•	 What is the balance between the (inexpensive) massive online aspect of OE and the (expensive) face-toface contact that defines current education systems?
•	 Will the future of education be dominated by a few
massive “university networks” with “talking head”
instructors?
•	 What is the utility of a final exam or high-stakes test
when machine learning analytics can accurately predict a student’s score from the regular coursework?
•	 How much does teaching improve with the use of
learning analytics to track both student and instructor performance?
•	 Can the use of analytics transform the educational
system from one where time is held constant and the
amount of learning is variable to a system where the
amount of learning is held constant and time is the
variable?
•	 Are there risks or tradeoffs if companies looking to
hire prefer a solid collection of industry-approved
badges over a college degree?

47

•	 How does OE impact academic freedom?
•	 What measures may be necessary to safeguard a student’s lifelong electronic learning record?
•	 How can OE enterprises be financially sustained
over the long term while remaining as accessible as
possible?
Clearly the education world is in for a turbulent, yet
fruitful, next decade.

State-Level Measures to Close the
STEM Skills Gap

in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as well
as thriving high-tech and life sciences industries. Yet there is a shortage of
workers appropriately trained and educated for what are often referred to as
middle-skills jobs in these industries. Such jobs—lab technician, computer
specialist, advanced manufacturing technician, radiation therapist, airplane
mechanic, and EMT professional, among others—account for 45 percent of
US employment (44 percent in Massachusetts) (Holzer and Lerman 2009).
To address this shortage, business and political leaders across the country have called for an increase in the number of students receiving baccalaureate and advanced degrees in STEM fields. But employers point to a
shortfall of employees with basic competencies appropriate to functioning in
the technology-intense environments of today’s workplaces. For instance,
a 2005 report by the National Association of Manufacturers found that,
although 35 percent of manufacturers anticipated a shortage of scientists
and engineers in the coming decade, more than twice as many anticipated
a dearth of skilled production workers (NAM 2005). That situation has

not changed. In January 2012 Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick reported that 240,000 people were
seeking employment while 120,000 jobs sat unfilled.1
Many of these jobs do not require advanced degrees but
rather the skills and knowledge of a two-year associate’s
degree or specialized training available in technical/
vocational high schools.
The responsibility to prepare young citizens for a productive and fulfilling life means providing them with a
quality education and the know-how to use that education for personal and professional achievement. This is
especially true during times of economic stress, when
unemployment is high and opportunities are in short
supply. It’s even more imperative when there is a disconnect between growth industries and the skilled workers
needed to advance that industry.
Governor Patrick and his administration are addressing these challenges through their commitment to education at all levels, and they are doing so in a highly
collaborative way. Massachusetts has established a
number of public-private partnerships among industry,
academia, and government. The governor also called
on his secretaries of Economic Development, Labor
and Workforce Development, and Education to coordinate their efforts to prepare the state’s youth and
adults for middle-skills jobs that are in demand. And
he created the position of Director of Education and
Workforce Development (who reports to all three secretaries) to engage high schools and community colleges in building career pathways that correspond to
industry demand, beginning with advanced manufacturing, life sciences, health care, and information technology. As described below, these efforts are already
producing impressive outcomes that offer students
more educational choices, better career readiness, and
greater access to employment.
Strategic Partnerships

Massachusetts has made significant investments in leadership for STEM education across the K–12 spectrum.
For example, the governor’s STEM Advisory Council,
established in 2009, is a dynamic forum for meaningful
collaboration among STEM advocates from business,
government, and education. It is the state’s principal

entity for promoting study and achievement in STEM
subjects, reaching out to students and their parents as
well as the general public.
Early on, the STEM Council, in an effort called
@Scale, identified and promoted programs that were
working well and could be scaled up for broader impact.
One such program, the Mass Math + Science Initiative (MMSI; part of the National Math and Science
Initiative), has increased enrollment and outcomes in
advanced placement (AP) classes in STEM and in English language courses, especially among minority and
low-income students. MMSI combines rigorous study
with multiple levels of academic support, including
extended-day and weekend tutoring, and professional
development for teachers.
The attention paid to these areas has influenced Massachusetts schools, particularly the commonwealth’s
vocational and technical high schools. An example
of such is the recent high achievements at Worcester
Technical High School (Figure 1). Under the visionary
leadership of principal Sheila Harrity, and with strong
support from the business community, Worcester Tech
has gone from the lowest- to the highest-performing
school in the Worcester Public School System on the
Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System in
just six years. In 2012, 88 percent of the students scored
in either the “advanced” or “proficient” categories in
English/language arts and 78 percent in mathematics,
compared to 27 and 35 percent, respectively, just six
years earlier. Moreover, Worcester Tech is enrolling

<-----Page 51----->50

increasing numbers of students in honors or AP courses,
and more than 70 percent of its graduates go on to fouryear colleges or universities.2
Worcester Tech has also engaged community partners
to develop new career-oriented programs. One example is a partnership with Tufts University’s Cummings
School of Veterinary Medicine, which runs the Tufts
at Tech Community Veterinary Clinic, a student-run
clinic at the high school. This innovative learning facility, using students from both schools, gives high school
students an opportunity to learn from veterinarians, and
offers citizens in the greater Worcester area affordable
veterinary care. The Tufts program is just one of a range
of offerings at Worcester Tech that combine career readiness with strong academic skills.

There is significant overlap
between the courses and
experiences that lead to both
college and career readiness.
Education of Students and Parents

Another goal of the Massachusetts K–12 initiatives
has been to educate both students and their parents
about the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in
the 21st century. To that end, education and business leaders from across the commonwealth came
together in a special task force, Integrating College
and Career Readiness (ICCR), which was established
in 2011 by the Massachusetts Board of Elementary
and Secondary Education and completed its work in
July 2012.3
The mission of the ICCR task force was to propose
ways to increase student and parent awareness of the
advantages of early thinking about career plans, to
determine whether or not they involve college-level
preparation, and to ensure the acquisition of necessary knowledge and abilities. The task force noted that

The

BRIDGE
although parents are prime influencers in a student’s
education, they are often unaware of the educational
requirements associated with specific career opportunities. It is therefore important to educate and inform
parents as much as students.
Among the pertinent findings of the task force was
that there is significant overlap between the courses
and experiences that lead to success in both college
and careers, and that students who pursue studies in
math and science have an advantage in both. Moreover, many growth industries require technical knowhow and at least a basic familiarity with mathematical
and scientific thinking, so continuing engagement in
these areas strengthens a student’s preparedness. Thus
the task force emphasized the value of (1) continued
study in STEM subjects throughout high school and (2)
internships, engagement with mentors from the business community, and other practical means of enabling
students to understand the nature and requirements
of the world of work. This finding raises worthwhile
concerns about persistent distinctions made in some
schools between “college prep” and “general” tracks
of study.
To further enhance student preparedness, Massachusetts adopted a high school program known as MassCore
that requires four years of English, four years of mathematics, and three years of a lab-based science. MassCore
is designed to ensure that all students graduate with the
basic knowledge and skills they will need to succeed in
college, career, and citizenship.
Community Colleges and Internships

Massachusetts recognizes that community colleges are
vital to closing the skills gap, especially through coordination of their curricula and learning outcomes with
the needs of growth industries.
To that end, the Massachusetts Life Science Education Consortium (MLSEC) designated subcommittees,
composed of leaders from business, higher education,
and the MLSEC staff, to study the life sciences curricula
at community colleges along with the skills requirements
for middle-skills jobs in that industry. The study showed
that 8 of the commonwealth’s 15 community colleges
meet or exceed the defined criteria for an effective program, while also identifying opportunities to enhance the
remaining programs. The 8 selected programs, designated “gold” or “silver” depending on whether they include
an internship opportunity, earn a three-year endorsement from the MLSEC, which in turn posts information

identify the community college programs best suited to
their interests.4

Patrick’s 2008 commitment

The Way Forward

Massachusetts has enjoyed a long and distinguished
history of innovation. From the birth of the American
Industrial Revolution to life-changing medical breakthroughs to the rise of the computer industry to the
parsing of the human genome, Massachusetts has been
home to some of the nation’s most dynamic innovations, in large part because of its exceptional system of
higher education, both public and private.
Today, however, it is no longer viable to view postsecondary education solely through the prism of undergraduate and graduate degree programs. With a large portion
of students falling outside that category, and with the
increasing need for development initiatives that target
the middle-skills workforce, Massachusetts has created
a comprehensive and collaborative model for supporting STEM education in the practical context of career
readiness and industry needs. This model has flourished
thanks to a series of policy initiatives invoking publicprivate partnerships and investments in STEM education, from K–12 through community colleges, four-year
universities, and workforce development programs.
Massachusetts colleges and universities have long
championed lifelong learning, which has never been
more relevant than today. The pace of innovation and
discovery makes continuous learning essential for the
modern workforce. And advances in technology are
changing not only the way people work but the way
they learn. From online colleges to certificate programs

at community colleges to distance learning and massive
open online courses, students and professionals have
more choices and opportunities to gain the education
they need to position themselves for rewarding careers.
Ensuring that these new forms of learning are widely
known and accessible is just one way that the state has
leveraged the power of its STEM education system.
In our positions at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the state’s Office of Education and Workforce
Development, we are proud to help Massachusetts
benefit from the expertise and interest of academia,
industry, and government, collaborating to identify
and implement strategies that strengthen workforce
development while providing young people with betterinformed educational choices, stronger outcomes, and
greater access to careers in rapidly growing sectors of
the economy. We hope that the report of these achievements will be useful to others with similar aspirations.

In 2007 the National Academy of Engineering, with support from the

National Science Foundation, convened a panel of leading thinkers from
academia, policy, and business with the charge of identifying a small number
of grand challenges for engineering in the 21st century. Their extraordinary
list of 14 representative challenges (Box 1) spans the need for sustainability,
health, security, and joy of living.
The challenges are remarkable because they both convey in very human
terms what engineering is and will be about, and clearly show that these
concerns are global in nature (e.g., manage the nitrogen cycle), necessarily
connected to behavior and policy as well as business (e.g., make solar energy
economical), and tap into social consciousness (e.g., provide clean water).

What’s Different about the Grand Challenge
Scholars Program

The NAE Grand Challenge Scholars program (http://
grandchallengescholars.org) was announced at the first
NAE Grand Challenges Summit in Durham, North
Carolina, in 2009.1 It is designed to prepare engineering undergraduates with the skills and mindset to tackle
the challenges over the course of their careers. It is now
under way at 13 leading universities (Box 2).
In addition to the engineering requirements for their
degree, students who complete the program create a
portfolio with the following five components:
1.	Global education experience
2.	Service learning
3.	Entrepreneurship
4.	Broad general education, including behavior,
economics, and policy
5.	Hands-on research or project related to one of the
Grand Challenges

•	 Western New England College, School of
Engineering
•	 St. Louis University, Parks College of Engineering,
Aviation & Technology
•	 University of Texas at Austin, Cockrell School of
Engineering

Upon completion participating students receive the
designation of NAE Grand Challenge Scholar on the
transcript from their home institution with the imprimatur of the NAE.
It is worth noting that the Grand Challenge Scholars
program leverages and complements existing research
and programs in modern engineering education pedagogy. Indeed, most top engineering schools already
offer some or all of the five components listed in some
form or another. What, then, is the value of bringing
them together in this program? That there would be
an answer was not certain to us when the initiative
was conceived but student response so far indicates
that there are several answers to the question “Aren’t
engineering schools already doing this?” First, the
Grand Challenge Scholars program compels students
to stretch to do all five rather than a few of the components. Second, it is one of the few programs that recognizes in the transcript the value (demonstrated through
research and experience) of out-of-classroom learning.
Third, and more significantly, the overwhelming feedback is that the process of creating their portfolio, as
much as the experiences themselves, helps students
appreciate the value of those experiences. They gain a

<-----Page 56----->SUMMER 2013

better understanding of how everything they have been
doing in their undergraduate work comes together to
prepare them to face their careers and important societal challenges.
Evidence of Impact

In 2008, the NAE report Changing the Conversation:
Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineering urged a reframing of what engineering involves to
connect with a new generation of students, not to mention the public at large, who are more motivated than
ever to change the world and to help people. The Grand
Challenges and Scholars program respond directly to
that call in a most powerful way.
In 2009, an independent survey conducted for the
organizers of the first NAE Grand Challenges Summit measured the responses of several demographics
to questions about the importance of engineering relative to medicine, business, and law before and after the
respondents heard a brief description of the NAE Grand
Challenges. The results were dramatic. After hearing
the description, the respondents who rated engineering as more important/more interesting than the other
fields increased from 40 percent to 54 percent, and the
number who rated it much more important/interesting rose
from 18 percent to 27 percent. Moreover, the increases were largest among women and underrepresented
groups.2 As a further data point, at one of our institutions (USC), since the recruitment materials for high
school seniors was modified to include the Grand Challenges the enrollment of women in the entering class
has risen to 38 percent. The Grand Challenge Scholars
program then continues to foster that interest once the
students are on the college campus.
All of the Grand Challenge Scholars programs have in
common the five components above, but differ in their
implementation. At Olin College, the development of
a comprehensive student portfolio integrating the five
Grand Challenge elements (and often other elements
involving projects of various kinds) is the primary method of implementation of the Scholars program. Other
engineering schools offer freshman seminar or overview
courses that incorporate the Grand Challenges.
In most cases, admission to the program is highly
selective and takes place later in the undergraduate
career. At USC, for example, portfolios of candidates

for the distinction Grand Challenge Scholar are submitted for selection and recognition at graduation. At
Duke, students attend information sessions in their
sophomore year and apply in their junior year; financial
support (about $5,000 per student) is provided primarily
for the hands-on component, thanks to an endowment
from generous donors.3
Incorporating the Grand Challenges in K–12
Education

At a 2010 meeting in St. Petersburg, Florida, engineering deans were polled for their views as to whether and
why Grand Challenges for Engineering should be introduced at the K–12 level. The majority (65 percent)
responded that teaching about the challenges in K–12
was important for educating and motivating the public
to be a part of their solution. About a third (31 percent)
responded that the most important reason to teach the
Grand Challenges was to increase the interest in and
pipeline for engineering. (Only 4 percent responded
that the Grand Challenges were not important to or
were too hard for K–12 students.)

K–12 teaching about the
Grand Challenges can both
motivate the public to be a
part of their solution and
increase the pipeline for
engineering.
Later that year a program aimed at bringing the
Grand Challenges to K–12 education (www.grand
challengek12.org) was announced, at the Regional
Grand Challenge Summit in Raleigh, North Carolina, cohosted by Duke and North Carolina State

It is worth noting that the Niarchos Foundation supports social
causes and the arts primarily, and originally did not see a connection between its mission and an engineering school. After
learning about the NAE Grand Challenges, foundation representatives were enthusiastic that this kind of program is exactly in
line with the foundation’s mission.

University (NCSU) under the leadership of NCSU
Engineering Dean Louis Martin-Vega. Dubbed the
NAE Grand Challenges K–12 Partners Program, this
national effort attempts to address the two priorities
reflected in the deans’ survey. It translates the five
components of the Grand Challenge Scholars program to a pedagogy appropriate for K–12 students,
creating a resource for teachers with ideas for lesson
plans that tie to Common Core and state standards. It
also connects undergraduate Grand Challenge Scholars to area schools where they can bring the excitement of the challenges and their own experiences to
school children.
Another novel application of the Grand Challenges
in K–12 pedagogy is being employed with success at
a new magnet high school in the Wake County Public School System on the NCSU campus. The Grand
Challenges are infused throughout the curriculum. For
example, the challenge “provide clean water” involves
an integrated engineering and social studies project
comparing water quality at two watersheds in North
Carolina. Students perform hands-on water filtration
studies and examine the geological and political factors
that result in very different water quality in each case.
Expanding and Moving Forward

There have been efforts to broaden the use of the Grand
Challenges approach to disciplines beyond engineering.
For example, discussions are under way to explore the
possibility of creating a Grand Challenge Scholars program for business and liberal arts majors at Babson College and Wellesley College.
Internationally, the NAE recently partnered with
the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAE) and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) to sponsor

a follow-on to the US summits and identify the need
and opportunities for global cooperation to address
the Grand Challenges. That meeting took place in
London, March 12–13, 2013. To support research and
the role of graduate students, eight universities active
in Grand Challenges education announced a PhD
scholarship program, called the Charles M. Vest NAE
Grand Challenges for Engineering Scholarships (the
Vest Scholarships for short; http://vestscholars.org).
The Scholarships are intended to be something like
a reverse Rhodes Scholarship; they provide resources
for a PhD student from abroad to study for a year at
one of the eight schools, working with faculty on a
Grand Challenge topic and then returning to their
home institution to complete their degree. The hope
is that the scholarships will (1) enrich the participants
through their overseas experience, (2) enhance global
collaborations that will lead to Grand Challenge solutions, and (3) form a network of scholars, with a common determination to tackle the world’s most difficult
and important problems, on which the students will
draw throughout their careers.
In summary, the NAE Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st century are a powerful framing of
what the field of engineering is and will become, one
that excites and engages young people and the public
alike. Moreover, they are an opportunity to “change the
conversation” about engineering and to enhance engineering education to give students at all levels the skills
and mindset to solve them.

NAE News and Notes
Charles M. Vest
NAE President
2007–2013
Charles M. Vest was elected in 2007
to a six-year term as president of the
National Academy of Engineering
and will complete his tenure on
June 30, 2013. He is also president
emeritus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Dr. Vest earned a BS in mechanical engineering from West Virginia
University in 1963 and MSE and
PhD degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of
Michigan in 1964 and 1967 respectively. In 1968 he joined the faculty
of the University of Michigan as
an assistant professor; he taught in
the areas of heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics, and
conducted research in heat transfer and engineering applications
of laser optics and holography. He
and his graduate students developed
techniques for making quantitative
measurements of various properties and motions from holographic
interferograms, especially the measurement of three-dimensional temperature and density fields using
computer tomography. He became
an associate professor in 1972 and
a full professor in 1977. In 1981
he turned much of his attention to
academic administration and served
as the university’s associate dean of
engineering (1981–1986) and dean
of engineering (1986–1989) before
becoming provost and vice president for academic affairs.
In 1990 Dr. Vest was elected president of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) and served in

Charles M. Vest

that position until December 2004,
when he became professor and
president emeritus. As president
of MIT, he was active in science,
technology, and innovation policy;
building partnerships among academia, government, and industry;
and championing the importance of
open, global scientific communication, travel, and the sharing of intellectual resources. During his tenure,
MIT launched its OpenCourseWare
(OCW) initiative; cofounded the
Alliance for Global Sustainability;
enhanced the racial, gender, and
cultural diversity of its students and
faculty; established major new institutes in neuroscience and genomic
medicine; and redeveloped much of
its campus.
Dr. Vest began his term as president of the National Academy of
Engineering in 2007. Under his
leadership, the NAE promoted the

Grand Challenges for Engineering, a set of 14 critical challenges
for engineers in the 21st century,
which, if achieved, will improve the
quality of life for humankind. This
effort spawned a number of Grand
Challenges Summits at universities
around the country and has contributed to better public understanding
of the value and importance of engineering advances to the well-being
of the nation and the world.
Dr. Vest presided over the international expansion of the NAE’s
Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) program to include partnerships with
China and the European Union. In
2009, he launched the annual NAE
Frontiers of Engineering Education
symposium series, aimed at identifying and propagating innovative
approaches to engineering teaching and learning. He also initiated
a major new NAE effort to understand and address changes in global
manufacturing-design-innovation
value chains and their implications
for US employment, education, and
competitiveness. And under his
leadership the NAE in 2011 developed a novel partnership with the
US Institute of Peace to consider
how the application of technology
and of knowledge and methods from
engineering and science can serve
the goals of conflict prevention,
peacemaking, and peacekeeping.
In addition to strengthening and
augmenting the strategic programs
of the NAE, Dr. Vest exercised his
visibility as NAE president to great

effect, playing a prominent role
both nationally and internationally in illuminating forces reshaping the landscape of engineering
research, practice, and education,
and in defining the attributes future
engineers will require to compete
and lead in the emerging global
economy.
Dr. Vest was a director of DuPont
for 14 years and of IBM for 13 years,
and vice chair of the US Council
on Competitiveness for 8 years. He
also served on various federal committees and commissions, including
the President’s Committee of Advi-

sors on Science and Technology
(PCAST) during the Clinton and
Bush administrations, the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding
Weapons of Mass Destruction, the
Secretary of Education’s Commission on the Future of Higher
Education, the Secretary of State’s
Advisory Committee on Transformational Diplomacy, and the
Rice-Chertoff Secure Borders and
Open Doors Advisory Committee.
He serves on the boards of several
nonprofit organizations and foundations devoted to education, science,

and technology. He has authored a
book on holographic interferometry
and two books on higher education.
He has received honorary doctoral
degrees from 17 universities, was
awarded the 2006 National Medal
of Technology by President Bush,
and received the 2011 Vannevar
Bush Award from the National Science Board.
We greatly appreciate Dr. Vest’s
thoughtful guidance and significant contributions in bolstering the
NAE’s national leadership during
his term, and wish him all the best
in his future pursuits.

Joel S. Engel, and Mr. Martin Cooper.

Martin Cooper, Joel S. Engel, Richard H. Frenkiel, Thomas Haug, and
Yoshihisa Okumura were awarded
the 2013 Charles Stark Draper Prize
“for their pioneering contributions

to the world’s first cellular telephone
networks, systems, and standards.”
Cellular telephony is an exceptional technological achievement
that has enabled people to commu-

nicate from virtually any location
and access a myriad of information
at the touch of a button. It connects
people, provides security, and bridges information gaps.
The first limited form of mobile
telephone service was provided
by AT&T in 1946, and the initial
ideas for cellular systems emerged
at Bell Labs a year later. A lack of
channels inhibited further exploration of these ideas until the late
1960s, when Bell Labs began planning activities for a “high-capacity”
mobile telephone system. Engel and
Frenkiel, with the late Phil Porter,
were the earliest engineers involved
in this work. They developed a
plan for a network of low-power
transmitters and receivers spread
throughout a region in small cov-

<-----Page 63----->The

BRIDGE

62

erage areas that came to be called
cells, which allowed the expansion
of service to millions of users with
a limited number of channels. This
plan resulted in a technical report,
filed with the US Federal Communications Commission in 1971, presenting the design for what would
become the Advanced Mobile
Phone System (AMPS), the first
cellular telephone system in the
United States.
At the same time, at Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)
Research Laboratories in Japan,
Yoshihisa Okumura was laying the
groundwork for a network system for
widespread simultaneous cell phone
use in that country. Through the
investigation of precise propagation
of radio waves in a high-frequency
range, he found data that provided
the foundation for a mobile model
that could be used over wide areas

that spanned cities, valleys, and
mountains. In 1979, the NTT network became the world’s first fully
integrated commercial cell phone
system and had the most advanced
electronic switching.
Shortly after the cellular network
was developed, Martin Cooper,
who was working at Motorola at
the time, unveiled the first portable
hand-held cellular phone. After
conducting in-depth research and
filing several patents on technologies needed for the device, Cooper and his team produced a fully
functional phone that utilized radio
waves and frequency reuse to enable
mobility and operability over a wide
area. In 1973, Cooper made the first
mobile telephone call on his cell
phone prototype from a New York
City street to a landline phone at
Bell Laboratories. The phone call
was answered by Engel.

In 1960 several Nordic countries
had their own local mobile systems,
but cell phone users were not able to
transfer calls between towers. From
1970 to 1982, Thomas Haug worked
to develop the Nordic Mobile Telephony (NMT) system, which provided analog service across the
region’s countries. In 1982, inspired
by the successful Nordic example,
he formed a research group to create a system that would enable users
to place and receive calls anywhere
in the world. By 1992 Haug and his
colleagues had successfully developed the new digital high-quality
and high-security mobile communication system called Global System for Mobile Communications
(GSM), which permitted users
to make and receive calls in and
between any countries where the
system was installed.

Acceptance Remarks by Richard Frenkiel

Richard H. Frenkiel

Our thanks to Dr. Vest, the Academy, and the Draper Laboratory for
this great honor, and to our families,
friends, and colleagues who have

come here tonight to share this
moment with us.
The creation of cellular telephony that we celebrate tonight
was always more of a journey than
a destination—a wide and winding
road of creation and conflict traveled by thousands of pioneers doing
many types of work over more than
half a century.
We five reflect that diversity rather well. Yoshihisa Okumura provided
the propagation data that we desperately needed to create the first cellular
plans, and he pioneered a statistical
approach that was perfect for a multicell system. Joel Engel was what
the philosophers call a polymath—
part researcher, worrying about delay
spread and diversity; part systems
engineer, shaping the cellular archi-

tecture; and part pamphleteer, sending passionate prose to the FCC. I
worked with him on the architecture
and the passionate prose, and then
went on to the details—things like
locating and handoff, and cell splitting, and standards. Thomas Haug
had an international vision. He led
the way to the Nordic Network, and
then got all of Europe to agree to
the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)—a remarkable
achievement in the days before the
European Union. Marty Cooper had
a vision of portability. He took the
cell phone from the trunk of his car
to the palm of his hand, and started us on the path to truly personal
communications.
And then a new generation of
pioneers created 3G systems with

<-----Page 64----->SUMMER 2013

Internet access, and smartphones,
and thousands of those useful
“apps.” Thanks to their vision and
skill, there are now 6 billion cell
phones in a world of 7 billion people, and the cell phone has become
an important part of daily life.
Even in those early days when we
were young, we walked that winding

63

road with hundreds of cellular pioneers. More than a few of them were
giants in our field, and too many of
them are now gone. In our hearts, we
share this moment with all of them.
We know that for an engineer, the
best life is to work with brilliant and
creative colleagues, on problems
that are fascinating and difficult,

and to dream that someday the work
you are doing will change the world.
We are blessed to have walked with
those early pioneers—those old
friends—and to have shared with
them that powerful dream and that
wonderful work.
Thank you.

Fritz J. and Dolores H. Russ Prize

Mr. Charles O. Holliday Jr., and Dr. Charles M. Vest.

The 2013 Fritz J. and Dolores H.
Russ Prize is awarded to Rangaswamy Srinivasan, James J. Wynne,
and Samuel E. Blum “for the development of laser ablative photodecomposition, enabling LASIK and
PRK eye surgery.”
The development and application of ablative photodecomposition in corrective eye surgeries,
known today as PRK and LASIK,
has given millions of people
throughout the world better vision.
At the end of 2011, approximately
25 million people had undergone
pulsed ultraviolet laser surgery to
improve their eyesight, a procedure
made possible by the collaborative
efforts of Srinivasan, Wynne, and

Blum. In 1981 while working at the
IBM T.J. Watson Research Center,
they discovered that pulsed laser
radiation at 193 nm from an argon
fluoride (ArF) excimer laser could
etch animal tissue with submicron
precision. Just as important, the
laser caused no thermal damage to
the adjacent tissue.
The initial discovery was made
on November 27, 1981, when Srinivasan brought leftovers from his
Thanksgiving meal into the lab. He
irradiated turkey cartilage with pulses of light from the ArF (193 nm)
excimer laser, and found it made a
clean “incision” in the tissue. On
subsequent days, he and Blum carried out additional turkey cartilage

procedures under controlled conditions, measuring the laser’s effect
and the number of pulses used to
produce incisions.
In parallel studies, Wynne conducted a comparable experiment
using pulsed laser radiation at
532 nm from a Q-switched, frequency-doubled, Nd:YAG laser
(532 nm), which did not result
in a clean incision like that of
the excimer laser. Instead, it left
a burned and damaged region
of tissue.
In 1982 and 1983, Srinivasan
and Wynne began to study the
effects of the ultraviolet excimer
laser on human tissue through collaborations with cardiologists, ophthalmologists, dermatologists, and
dental anatomists. Together with
coworkers, the two men obtained
fresh arterial tissue from a cadaver
at New York Hospital (now New
York–Presbyterian Hospital) and
irradiated a segment of the aorta
with 193 nm light from the ArF
excimer laser and, separately, with
532 nm pulses from the Nd:YAG
laser. The experiment yielded the
same results as the turkey experiment: the excimer laser left no
detectable evidence of thermal
damage to the underlying and adjacent tissue while the 532 nm pulses
caused visible thermal damage.

In 1983, Srinivasan, his IBM colleague Bodil Braren, and ophthalmologist Stephen Trokel published
a paper on the potential for laser

eye surgery in the American Journal
of Ophthalmology. The publication
detailed an excimer laser experiment on several enucleated calf

eyes, which yielded excellent results
and is regarded by the ophthalmic
community as a seminal paper on
laser refractive surgery.

Acceptance Remarks by Rangaswamy Srinivasan

Rangaswamy Srinivasan

I am delighted that Dr. James
Wynne and I, along with the late
Dr. Samuel E. Blum, have been
selected to receive the Fritz J. and
Dolores Russ Prize for 2013. This
prize is notable for its emphasis on
the impact of an engineering invention on a field of biology/medicine.
(Let me add parenthetically that the
field of bioengineering was not even
identified as a separate discipline 50
years ago.) In 1999 when the Russ
Prize was established, the National
Academy of Engineering ruled that
it would be dedicated to this field
exclusively. This is only the seventh

time that the prize is being awarded.
I bring up this bit of history because
of the three winners this time: one
was trained as a laser physicist and
the other two as a crystal chemist
and a photochemist.
Our discovery in 1981 of the phenomenon of ablative photodecomposition of tissue by short, energetic
pulses of far-ultraviolet radiation
was not entirely an accident. It came
about because it happened in a laser
group that was pioneering the use of
an excimer laser—a novelty at that
time. I, the photochemist, noticed
that a commercial polymer called
Kapton, which resisted smooth
etching by chemical solvents or
solutions, could be easily drilled
precisely and rapidly by a succession
of focused laser pulses of 193 nm
wavelength. It occurred to me that
just as Kapton has a series of polyimide groups along its backbone, a
protein is characterized by a succession of polyamide or peptide groups
along its backbone. It was natural to
try and see how well this relationship would enable the same laser
at that wavelength to drill or etch
solid animal tissue. We observed
that the tissue was etched remarkably smoothly without any sign of

thermal damage. Dr. Wynne then
carried out the control experiment,
which used a focused visible (green)
laser at a similar fluence on the same
animal tissue. It created excessive
thermal damage. The experiment
established that the excimer laser
wavelength and fluence were key to
the striking results we observed.
It is not surprising that it has taken many years for our experiments
to be translated into a viable process
for the etching of the human cornea. In the beginning, we needed
to educate the practicing ophthalmologists in the chemical physics
of ablative photodecomposition.
Then a lot of engineering expertise was required to build a working
machine, which was tested on rabbits, monkeys, and eventually on
human eyes, with FDA supervision,
of course. Today the reshaping of
the human cornea by this process is
widely practiced in developed countries. There you have the merging of
physical science, biology, and engineering science—the synergy that
the Russ Prize demanded!
Needless to say, we are truly overwhelmed by this honor. Thank you
one and all!

Gordon Prize Committee; Dr. Sherra E. Kerns; Dr. David V. Kerns Jr.; Dr. Richard K.
Miller; and Dr. Charles M. Vest.

Richard K. Miller, David V. Kerns
Jr., and Sherra E. Kerns were awarded the 2013 Bernard M. Gordon
Prize “for guiding the creation of
Olin College and its student-centered approach to developing effective engineering leaders.”
Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering was founded in 1997 to
prepare “students to become exemplary engineering innovators who
recognize needs, design solutions,
and engage in creative enterprises
for the good of the world.” Since the
first students enrolled 10 years ago,
Olin has become a significant agent

for innovation in undergraduate
engineering education with the goal
of preparing the next generation for
the complex, global challenges of
the 21st century.
The F.W. Olin Foundation established Olin College to literally start
over in higher education and develop a new paradigm for engineering
education, addressing at once all the
concerns raised about engineering
education at the time. Furthermore,
the purpose of the new institution is
to “become an important and constant contributor to the advancement of engineering education in

America and throughout the world.”
To ensure a fresh approach, Olin
does not offer tenure, has no academic departments, offers degrees
only in engineering, and provides
substantial merit-based scholarships
to all admitted students.
Richard Miller, as the college’s
president and first employee, provided the strategic vision and overall leadership of all aspects of the
process of developing this new institution, including the shaping of its
academic and institutional mission.
David Kerns, founding provost,
recruited Olin’s faculty and deans,
led the establishment of the collaborative faculty process resulting in
Olin’s three program curricula, and
established employment relations
for faculty in an environment without tenure. Sherra Kerns, as founding vice president of innovation
and research, ensured the establishment of a gender-balanced community, led the efforts to achieve
accreditation for the new programs,
and was instrumental in creating a
culture of innovation and intellectual vitality throughout the institution. All three also contributed to
specific dimensions of the academic
program, together with the faculty
and students.

Acceptance Remarks by Richard K. Miller
First, we would like to express our
deepest appreciation to Mr. Gordon for his generosity and commitment to advancing the field of
engineering through innovations in
education. It is a humbling experience to accept this award and our
deep gratitude goes to the Academy

and the selection committee. This
award means a lot not only to us
but also to the entire Olin community and many other educators in
the field who are at the forefront of
educational reform. I would also like
to add my congratulations to the
Draper and Russ Prize Awardees for

their pioneering work in developing
technologies that have changed and
will continue to change our world.
Olin College is unique in higher
education. It was the vision of Larry
Milas, former president of the F.W.
Olin Foundation and our first chairman of the board, who is here with

us tonight. As he declared in our
founding precepts, “Olin College is
intended to be different, not for the
mere sake of being different, but to
become an important and constant
contributor to the advancement of
engineering education in America
and throughout the world.”
Olin was started from a blank
slate in order to rethink engineering education from the ground up,
and to address simultaneously all
of the concerns about engineering education known at the time.
You see, Larry and the other three
foundation directors (including Bill
Norden, our current board chair)
believed that a new mindset is needed in higher education, not simply
a new course or academic program
here and there. He felt that higher
education was too set in its ways and
not sufficiently open to new ideas.
When I was selected in 1999 as
Olin’s first employee, I was nearly
overwhelmed by the responsibility to deliver on these enormous
expectations. My first task was to
recruit an experienced and visionary leadership team to help shape
this unique institution. Somehow
I persuaded both David and Sherra

Kerns to leave their leadership positions at Vanderbilt to join me. We
all walked away from tenured positions at respected institutions in
order to create an institution that,
by design, will never offer tenure
to its faculty. We also concluded
that we would not create academic
departments, in order to promote
interdisciplinary thinking—like
Bell Labs, 3M, Google, and Ideo.
We concluded that design thinking
and entrepreneurship would play a
central role in the academic program. In fact, Olin is located adjacent to Babson College to enable
mixing the DNA of gifted engineers
with the most entrepreneurial new
business leaders.
This Olin College project was so
important that we all felt we must
seek the help of the best minds
everywhere in order to make the
most of this opportunity—an opportunity that, incidentally, occurs
much less frequently than once in
a lifetime. As a result, I formed the
President’s Council to provide strategic advice. The first member of
this council was Bill Wulf, who was
then president of the NAE. Many
other members of the NAE have
since become engaged, and 20 percent of our current trustees are NAE
members.
In addition, we visited 30 other
universities and many corporations
to seek advice on what changes in
education they would recommend.
We also shamelessly recruited faculty members away from many of
the most respected universities in
America. As you know, excellent
universities—without exception—
are always fundamentally about
excellent people. So Olin College
is, to a large extent, the result of
contributions of the best ideas and
people from around the nation.

We owe any success we have had
to many other institutions. In this
sense, our success is your success,
and we are deeply grateful for your
support. We simply would not be
here tonight without you.
However, the heavy lifting of conceiving, integrating, experimenting,
balancing, and implementing the
many new ideas that form the Olin
learning model is the result of the
endless hard work and innovation
of our passionate faculty and student
body. They deserve the lion’s share
of the credit for what exists today at
Olin. Students, in particular, have
played the key role in seeing what
others did not see and showing us
that we frequently underestimate
what they are capable of doing.
Without the help of our students,
we would no doubt have a patchwork quilt of traditional courses
instead of the holistic, integrated
learning culture that now defines
the Olin program.
There is one person notably
missing tonight and that is the late
Michael Moody, founding dean of
faculty at Olin College and a central figure in the development of
Olin’s academic program. We lost
him three years ago to cancer but
he remains alive in the pedagogy
at Olin and in the hearts of his
colleagues.
In the next decade, we are on a
very deliberate mission to lead in
the transformation of undergraduate engineering education. We have
been visited by more than 200 universities in the last three years, by
those who are interested in innovation in education. We aim to graduate more engineering innovators
and leaders to address the grand
challenges our world now faces and
to drive the creation of jobs requiring imagination, innovation, and a

<-----Page 68----->SUMMER 2013

67

deep knowledge of engineering and
science. This prize could not have
come at a better time to accelerate
our efforts in this cause.

And finally, I know I speak for
David, Sherra, and the members of
the greater Olin community when I
thank our families for their support.

Again, we are enormously grateful to the Academy for this great
honor. Thank you.

2013 National Meeting
NAE members and guests gathered
at the Beckman Center in Irvine,
California, on February 7 for the
2013 NAE National Meeting, which
was held in honor of Charles M.
Vest. After the morning’s business
session, the members were joined
by 155 students from the following
local schools: Firebaugh and Lynwood High Schools in Los Angeles
County; High Tech High (HTH) and
High Tech Middle (HTM), HTH
International, and HTH and HTM
Media Arts, all in San Diego; HTH
and HTM Chula Vista; and HTH and
HTM North Country in San Marcos,
as well as students from the Uni-

Dr. Mote with UCI students

versity of California, Irvine (UCI)
California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) Program.
NAE chair Charles O. Holliday
Jr. welcomed the members, guests,
and students to the symposium with
brief remarks encouraging the students to consider the impact they
can have on the world through a
career in engineering. Vice President Maxine L. Savitz chaired
the technical session and began by
introducing keynote speaker Yannis C. Yortsos, Dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering at the
University of Southern California
(USC). In his talk on “The NAE

Grand Challenges: An Inspiration
for Our Times,” Dean Yortsos noted that the concept of engineering
Grand Challenges was formulated
by an NAE committee in 2007 and
has proven to be an effective vehicle to inform policymakers, the public, students, and their parents and
advisors on the critical importance
of engineering to solving significant
challenges that face society. Together with partners at Duke University
and Olin College, Dr. Yortsos has
helped promote the Grand Challenges by cohosting the inaugural
NAE Grand Challenges Summit
at Duke University in 2009 and
its follow-up at USC in 2010. The
first summit led to the creation of
the Grand Challenge Scholars Program for undergraduate engineering
schools across the nation.
The program continued with Gilbreth Lectures on issues related to
the Grand Challenges, presented by
young engineers who had participated in the NAE’s Frontiers of Engineering symposia. Ronald Azuma,
Augmented Reality Leader, Intel
IXR, spoke on “Augmented Reality: Meaningful Connections and
Compelling Experiences.” Manu
Parashar, Principal Power Systems
Engineer, Alstom Grid, spoke on
“Synchrophasor Wide-Area Measurement and Control.” Sossina
Haile, Carl F. Braun Professor of

Brian Morey, another UCI student, wrote:
I found the NAE symposium to be
a great experience and an excellent networking opportunity….
I found the presenters to be welcoming and more than willing to
talk about their current projects
after they gave their presentations.
One of the presenters, Dr. Ronald
Azuma, even provided me with
a paper that detailed how computers tracked objects with their
camera after I asked him several
questions about his presentation. I
talked with several other attendees
as well and was surprised at how
approachable they were and their
willingness to share their experiences in the field of engineering.
Unlike conferences where I always
felt a disconnect between representatives and students, I found it
refreshing to meet professors that
were willing to just talk and share
their knowledge and experiences.

The day ended with a reception
for members and guests.
Students were invited to comment on their experience at the
meeting. UCI student Walter Cisneros observed:
It was a great opportunity to
approach individuals that have
accomplished their educational
and career goals. It was amazing
to spend time with the innovators
of the bases of what now we call

technology. For example, I talked
to engineers that helped with the
design of a challenger spacecraft
and an engineer that helped with
the design of the first intercontinental ballistic missile. Engineers
like them shaped the world and…
our country. The opportunity to
meet engineers of such…magnitude has radically changed my perspective on how important it is to
become a successful engineer and
to make a positive impact in our
society.

And Sharon Tamir, a student
of the Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs
HTH Graduating Class of 2016,
sent a letter (reproduced on page
70) detailing the highlights and
lasting impressions of her experience at the meeting.
The NAE National Meeting is an
opportunity to inspire and encourage students, especially those from
local high schools, to become engineers. The next National Meeting
is scheduled for February 6, 2014, at
the Beckman Center. Mark your calendar now and plan on coming and
reaching out to the students about
your experiences in engineering.

Global Grand Challenges Summit Held in London
In March, the NAE and the engineering academies of the United
Kingdom and China, with principal support from Lockheed Martin,
cohosted the first Global Grand
Challenges Summit (GGCS) in
London. More than 400 people participated in the 2-day event with the
goal of identifying opportunities for
global cooperation on engineering
innovation and education to address
common technological goals.
Also in attendance were 60 students from around the world who
were invited to attend Student Day
just before the GGCS. They were
asked to choose one of six NAE
Grand Challenges for Engineering
and develop a pitch for one way of
addressing it. Each team presented

its proposal before a panel of expert
judges and the winner, TeleHealth
Express aimed at streamlining
medical care, was showcased at the
Summit.
GGCS panel sessions focused on
six themes: sustainability, health,
education, technology and growth,
enriching life, and resilience. Summit speakers included Caltech’s
Frances Arnold, Imperial College professor Lord Darzi, former
DARPA head and current Google/
Motorola executive Regina Dugan,
Stanford University president John
Hennessy, prolific inventor Dean
Kamen, and economist Jeffrey
Sachs, among others.
Additional highlights included
plenary addresses from genome pio-

neer J. Craig Venter and Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates, presentation
of the Global Grand Challenges
Video Contest winners by NASA’s
Charles Elachi and entertainer
Will.i.am, and announcement of
the Vest Scholarships in honor of
NAE President Charles M. Vest.
Also announced at the event was a
new joint project between the US
National Science Foundation and
the UK Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council to fund
transatlantic research with the goal
of providing all people with access
to clean water.
The Video Contest was cosponsored by IBM and Genentech, and
the Student Day by Microsoft.

International Scholarship Focused on Global Grand Challenges
On March 13, 2013, at the inaugural Global Grand Challenges Summit (GGCS) in London, eight US
universities announced the establishment of Vest Scholarships at
their institutions. The new scholarship program, named after outgoing
NAE President Charles M. Vest,
will foster international collaborations among graduate students
whose studies focus on tackling
some of the world’s biggest challenges. The scholarship has been
endorsed by both the NAE and the
UK Royal Academy of Engineering.
The participating universities are
leaders in research to address the NAE
Grand Challenges for Engineering
(www.engineeringchallenges.org),
14 goals with the potential to dramatically improve life in the 21st
century, identified in 2008 by a

blue-ribbon committee of leading
technological thinkers and doers.
The challenges are the inspiration
for the GGCS.
“The NAE Grand Challenges for
Engineering address global issues
that transcend national boundaries,” said Yannis C. Yortsos, dean of
the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering.
“They are timely, inspirational, and
interdisciplinary. Their solutions
are also within reach in this time of
exponential technology gains. The
Vest Scholarships will provide the
glue that will enable the engagement of the international engineering and scientific communities
in pursuits that will benefit all of
humanity.”
The Grand Challenges are
already being incorporated into

education at all levels—including
an undergraduate Grand Challenge
Scholars Program at several US
colleges and universities—and Dr.
Vest has been influential in raising
their visibility.
“All of the sponsoring schools
were unanimous in naming the
scholarships for Dr. Vest,” said Tom
Katsouleas, dean of engineering at
Duke University. “His leadership
and championing of the Grand
Challenges, and the role of the engineering profession, has been inspirational.”
In the first year, applicants from
schools whose students attended the
Global Grand Challenges Summit
will be eligible for the scholarships.
In later years, the program will be
expanded to additional schools.
“This is like a reverse Rhodes

<-----Page 73----->The

Scholarship,” said Katsouleas. “It
gives select international graduate
students the opportunity to pursue
potentially world-changing ideas at
top US universities.”
Participating schools are Duke
University, California Institute of
Technology, Olin College, Uni-

versity of Southern California,
University of Washington, Illinois
Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and North Carolina State University. Selected students will receive
an expense-paid year to pursue
research opportunities related to

the 14 NAE Grand Challenges
for Engineering at one of those
institutions.

2013 German-American Frontiers of Engineering Held at
Beckman Center

The 2013 German-American Frontiers of Engineering Symposium
(GAFOE) took place April 26–28
at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman
Center in Irvine, California. The
NAE partners with the Alexander
von Humboldt Foundation to organize this event, the first of the bilateral Frontiers of Engineering programs,
started in 1998. The symposium
organizing committee was cochaired
by Cynthia Barnhart, associate dean
of engineering and professor of civil
and environmental engineering at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Peter Moser, head of
innovative power plant technology
R&D at RWE Power AG.
Modeled on the US Frontiers of
Engineering Symposium, GAFOE
brings together emerging engineering leaders ages 30–45 from German

and US companies, universities, and
government with the goal of providing a forum for them to learn about
leading-edge developments in a
range of engineering fields and thus
facilitating interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and methodology.
The bilateral Frontiers symposia also
help build cooperative networks of
younger engineers across national
boundaries.
The four topics covered at this
year’s GAFOE were additive manufacturing, transport in complex
systems, biomass conversion, and
materiomics. Presentations by two
Germans and two Americans in
each area covered topics such as
design for additive manufacturing,
collective motion from active matter to swarms in natural engineered
systems, production and utilization

of green hydrogen, and innovative
biomimetic materials inspired by
plants. The program, list of attendees, and presentation slides are
available at the GAFOE link at
www.naefrontiers.org.
As is typical with bilateral FOE
meetings, there was a poster session on the first afternoon where
attendees presented their research
or technical work to each other.
The posters remained on display throughout the meeting and
prompted many conversations and
continued exchanges.
The dinner speech was delivered by Frances H. Arnold, Dick
and Barbara Dickinson Professor
of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering, and Biochemistry at the
California Institute of Technology.
It was particularly meaningful for

<-----Page 74----->SUMMER 2013

her to give the dinner address as she
was the first speaker at the very first
US Frontiers of Engineering symposium in 1995. She spoke about how
the ability to synthesize genomes
will enable researchers to “compose”
in the biological world and create
useful things that can alleviate some
of the world’s grand challenges.
On the second afternoon, attendees took a beach and nature walk
and learned about local marine life
and the history of Laguna Beach.
Everyone enjoyed the opportunity
to experience firsthand the beautiful weather and views of southern
California’s Pacific coast as well as
the chance for interactions in an
informal setting.

73

Funding for the meeting was provided by The Grainger Foundation
and the National Science Foundation. The next GAFOE meeting
will take place in 2015 in Germany,
and Drs. Barnhart and Moser will
continue to serve as cochairs.
The NAE has additional bilateral
Frontiers of Engineering programs
with Japan, India, China, and the
European Union. In 2014, a joint
Frontiers of Science and Engineering symposium organized with the
National Academy of Sciences will
be held in Brazil. All the FOE symposia bring together outstanding
engineers from industry, academe,
and government at a relatively early
point in their careers (all partici-

pants, including speakers and organizers, are 30–45 years old). The
meetings provide an opportunity for
them to learn about developments,
techniques, and approaches at the
forefront of fields other than their
own, something that has become
increasingly important as engineering has become more interdisciplinary. The program also facilitates the
establishment of contacts and collaboration among the next generation of engineering leaders.

activity, go to www.naefrontiers.org

NAE Program Office at (202) 3341571 or jhunziker@nae.edu.

“It’s like 1993 in the history of the
World Wide Web,” agreed David
Patterson, a University of California, Berkeley, computer science professor who cotaught one of the early
MOOCs.
Patterson was one of six panelists
discussing “Online learning: Will
technology transform higher education?” Most agreed that MOOCs,
which have expanded from three
classes offered by Stanford in 2011
to hundreds offered by dozens of universities, offer unprecedented opportunities for people who would not
otherwise have access to high-quality higher education. Panelists also
said they are encouraged by widespread faculty interest in examining
ways to improve their teaching.
“People are thinking about the
classroom experience in a more
careful and meticulous way,” said
panelist John Mitchell, Vice Provost
for Online Learning at Stanford.

But opinions varied widely about
the future of MOOCs, how learning
will evolve as a result of new technologies, and whether technology is
even a driving force behind current
shifts in higher education.
Technologies like broadband
Internet and social media that have
helped make MOOCs possible
“reduce the friction that is holding together the building blocks” of
higher education, said panel moderator Bernd Girod, Senior Associate Dean for Online Learning and
Professional Development at Stanford Engineering. “MOOCs could
be to higher education what Napster was to the music industry,” he
said, referring to the music-sharing
system that helped change how
music is purchased and consumed.
He added that online technologies
have repeatedly enabled unbundling and disrupted traditional business models.

NAE Regional Meetings
Symposium on Online
Learning and How Technology
May Change Higher Education,
Held at Stanford University

Massive open online courses
(MOOCs) were front and center at a
symposium held in conjunction with
the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) regional meeting March
5 at Stanford University’s School of
Engineering. NAE Vice President
Maxine L. Savitz opened the meeting, noting that the NAE is preparing to celebrate its 50th anniversary
in 2014, and Stanford Engineering
Dean Jim Plummer followed, introducing the often-controversial topic
of online learning.
“I’ve heard fear expressed that
higher education as we know it is
coming to an end. I’ve also heard
that online learning is going to
reinvent higher education in a new
and better form,” said Plummer. “It’s
clearly a rapidly evolving field.”

Mitchell Stevens, an associate
professor of education at Stanford,
said the move to online education is
driven not by technology but by factors such as contracting state budgets, which put pressure on many
colleges to reduce costs even as they
face growing scrutiny of their performance. But he added that digital
educational delivery mechanisms
enable college educators to measure
and improve performance.
At the same time, MOOCs
pose new challenges for educators
because of the lack of one-on-one
faculty-student interaction. Tina
Seelig, executive director of the
Stanford Technology Ventures
Program who recently taught her
second online session of “A Crash
Course in Creativity,” said the biggest challenge she faced was the
extreme precision the online class
required. “When you’re teaching
an online class, if you’re not exactly
clear about what you want [from
students], you don’t get exactly what
you expect,” she said.
Another challenge is that only
a small percentage of students who
enroll in a MOOC actually complete it. One way to change that is
to offer students course credit for
successful completion, said David
Stavens, president and cofounder
of online education startup Udacity.
The company recently partnered
with San Jose State University
to offer three classes for credit for
$150 each, the first such agreement
between a MOOC provider and a
university.
Jennifer Widom, chair of Stanford’s computer science department,
recently taught her second “Introduction to Databases” MOOC.
Although she said she finds it gratifying to be able to reach tens of thousands of people who can’t enroll in

her Stanford course, she and others
question whether the MOOC model
in its current form is sustainable.
Some wonder how the numerous businesses that have sprung
up around MOOCs will stay afloat
while delivering a free product.
Others point out the potential challenges of verifying student identity
and preventing cheating, especially
if course credit is offered. Some worry that the growth of online education could endanger small colleges;
others see an opportunity for institutions offering top-tier programs to
license course content to others and
improve the quality of education on
a large scale.
Most agree, however, that online
education in some format holds
enormous promise. “There are lots
of opportunities ahead,” said Girod.
“This is an exciting time for higher
education.”
2013 NAE Southeast Regional
Meeting Summary

Gen. Keith Alexander delivering the
keynote speech at the March 28 NAE
regional meeting on cyber security.

The Georgia Institute of Technology hosted the NAE’s 2013 Southeast regional meeting on April 28

in Atlanta. Scheduled adjacent to
a cyber security–related conference
the next day, featuring university
CIOs and the FBI, the two events
were jointly billed as the Georgia
Tech Cyber Security Symposium.
Georgia Tech President Bud
Peterson and Provost Rafael Bras,
together with NAE Vice President
Maxine Savitz, welcomed a capacity crowd to the meeting, which was
free and open to the public. College of Computing Dean Zvi Galil
served as emcee.
The afternoon was devoted to
a critically important issue facing
both the United States and the
world: cyber security. Gen. Keith
Alexander, director of the National
Security Agency, chief of Central
Security Service, and commander
of US Cyber Command, delivered a
wide-ranging keynote address titled
“US Cyber Security: Key Issues for
Our Future.”
He touched on the variety and
nature of cyber threats facing government and industry, as well as other challenges facing those charged
with protecting digital assets, such
as the need to balance effective
security with individual and organizational privacy rights. The general
also offered strong encouragement
to security students in attendance.
“We need a significantly larger
workforce in cyber security,” Alexander said. “That’s where you—
Georgia Tech—come in. This is
going to be one of the biggest growth
areas for the next several years. For
all of you [studying cyber security]
here today, you’re in the right place.
If you are good in this area, you’ll
have no problem getting a job.”
Attendees then got an inside
look at cyber security from several
perspectives. First was a session
featuring startup companies and/or

of Computer Science), which is
dedicated to “securing the converged telephony infrastructure”

The regional meeting concluded
with an entertaining exchange
on cyber security policy, featuring
two White House veterans. Arguing from the right side of the aisle
was Stewart Baker, partner in the
Washington law firm of Steptoe
and Johnson and a former head of
the Department of Homeland Security Policy Directorate under President George W. Bush. On the left
was Peter Swire, C. William O’Neill
Professor of Law at Ohio State University, who has served as an advisor
on cyber security to Presidents Bill
Clinton and Barack Obama. The
session was moderated by Annie
Anton, chair of Georgia Tech’s
School of Interactive Computing.

Implications for America’s
Regional Manufacturing
Economies, Held at Carnegie
Mellon University

Shale gas production in the United
States is increasing at a rapid rate
and is expected to provide half of
the country’s natural gas supply
by 2040. This low-cost, abundant
resource has already stimulated
a petrochemical manufacturing
renaissance in the United States,
and there is the hope and expectation that more benefits will be realized in other manufacturing sectors
and in transportation. However,
adequate infrastructure is essential
if the downstream benefits of shale
gas are to be realized. And every
stage—from extraction to distribution, processing, and end use—creates environmental impacts, for

which a stable and adequate regulatory environment is required.
It was especially timely, then, that
the National Academy of Engineering and Carnegie Mellon University’s Willard E. Scott Institute for
Energy Innovation convened a
symposium on Shale Gas: Implications for America’s Regional Manufacturing Economies on April 4,
2013. Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh
campus provided an excellent and
fitting venue in light of the rapid
and dynamic development of gas
resources in the western Pennsylvania portion of the Marcellus Shale
Formation.
David Dzombak, Carnegie Mellon’s Walter J. Blenko Sr. University
Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, welcomed 275
attendees and served as moderator.
NAE Vice President Maxine Savitz
welcomed participants on behalf of
the Academy.
Jared Cohon, Carnegie Mellon’s president, set the stage for the
remainder of the symposium with
an overview of the technical, economic, and political complexities
of shale gas development as well as
the uncertainties faced by industry,
regulators, local communities, and
landowners. He stressed the importance of finding balanced solutions,
which are more likely to be produced
through collaboration and cooperation in pursuing shared goals.
The first of three panels focused
on industrial development. Moderated by Andrew Gellman, Head and
Lord Professor of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon and
codirector of the Scott Institute,
the panel featured Gerald Holder,
US Steel Dean of Engineering and
professor of chemical and petroleum engineering at the University of Pittsburgh; Anthony Cugini,

director of the US Department of
Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory; Peter Molinaro,
vice president for North America
Government Affairs at Dow Chemical; and Russell Crockett Jr., senior
vice president of TPC Group, a
leader in the petrochemical industry. The range of opportunities and
challenges for the downstream use
of shale gas were explored in a spirited discussion with many questions
from the audience.
The availability of relatively
inexpensive shale gas has significant
implications for American manufacturing. Formations with “wet gas”
(natural gas with relatively high
concentrations of ethane, propane,
and butane), which include the Marcellus Shale, can be a source of feedstock for the petrochemical industry.
Processing this wet gas requires very
expensive infrastructure. Thus, the
most likely scenario will see such gas
transported to the Gulf Coast, which
has extensive petrochemical industry and facilities.
Shale gas can also be used to
meet industrial energy needs. This
is surely a benefit for manufacturers,
although it is questionable that inexpensive and abundant energy would,
by itself, lead to a manufacturing
renaissance in parts of America.
Particularly intriguing is the socalled “Third Wave.” In this scenario, petrochemicals produced
from relatively cheap shale gas
and used as inputs to other industrial processes could spur significant

growth in regional manufacturing.
The combination of inexpensive
inputs, proximity to customers, and
access to technological leadership
might induce companies to return
to America from the low-cost countries to which they moved.
The second panel, on national
gas transportation, was moderated
by Caren Glotfelty, senior director
of the Environmental Program at
the Heinz Endowments. The panelists were Ellen McLean, interim
CEO of the Port Authority of
Allegheny County; James McCarville, executive director of the Port
of Pittsburgh Commission; Richard
Kauling, manager of the Global
Gaseous Fuels Technical Resource
Center at General Motors; William
Chernicoff, manager of energy and
environmental research at Toyota
Motor North America; and Bradley
Mallory, executive deputy secretary
for administration of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
Compressed natural gas (CNG) is
an attractive fuel for vehicle fleets,
such as city buses. The economic
savings and environmental benefits
may justify the investment required
for storage, refueling, and transportation facilities. Broader use of CNG,
beyond captive fleets, is more uncertain. Shale gas may play an important role as a feedstock for hydrogen
fuel-cycle vehicles, although the
infrastructure required is a major
hurdle. Nevertheless, the aggressive
national fuel economy standards
may provide a very strong impetus.

The third panel, on environmental impacts, was moderated by
Granger Morgan, head and Lord
University Professor of Engineering
and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon and director of the Scott Institute. The panelists were Andrew
Morgan, corporate director of
energy and environmental policy at
EQT; Jeanne VanBriesen, professor
of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon; Allen
Robinson, head and Lane Professor
of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon; and Paul King, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania
Environmental Council.
Shale gas production has both air
and water impacts, both of which
were reviewed by the panel. As
research and debates over regulation proceed, there is an emerging
sense that environmental effects
can be contained through the adoption and use of best practices. The
Center for Sustainable Shale Gas
Development (CSSD) is a promising new initiative; its interim executive director, Mr. Place, explained
that this multisector organization
will seek to promote best practices.
Professor Dzombak closed the
symposium with thanks to Deborah Stine, executive director of the
Scott Institute and professor in the
practice of engineering and public
policy at Carnegie Mellon, for her
outstanding effort in organizing the
event.

Building the Ohio Innovation Economy:
Summary of a Symposium. Since 1991,
the National Research Council
(NRC)’s Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP)
has undertaken a program of activities to improve policymakers’ understandings of the interconnections of
science, technology, and economic
policy and their importance for the
American economy and its international competitiveness. One important element of STEP’s analysis
concerns the growth and impact of
foreign technology programs. US
competitors have launched substantial programs to support new technologies, small firm development,
and consortia among large and small
firms to strengthen national and
regional positions in strategic sectors.
Many state and local governments

and regional entities are undertaking
a variety of initiatives to enhance
local economic development and
employment through investment
programs designed to attract knowledge-based industries and grow innovation clusters. STEP’s project on
state and regional innovation initiatives is intended to generate a better understanding of the challenges
associated with the transition of
research into products, the practices
associated with successful state and
regional programs, and their interaction with federal programs and private initiatives. The study seeks to
achieve this goal through a series of
complementary assessments of state,
regional, and federal initiatives;
analyses of specific industries and
technologies from the perspective of
crafting supportive public policy at
all three levels; and outreach to multiple stakeholders.

Energy Reduction at US Air Force
Facilities Using Industrial Processes: A
Workshop Summary. The Department
of Defense (DOD) is the largest
consumer of energy in the federal
government, and the US Air Force
is the largest consumer of energy
in the DOD, with a total annual
energy expenditure of around $10
billion. Approximately 84 percent
of Air Force energy use involves liq-

uid fuel consumed in aviation and
about 12 percent is energy (primarily electricity) used in facilities on
the ground. This workshop focused
on opportunities to reduce energy
consumption at Air Force facilities
that use energy-intensive industrial
processes (e.g., maintenance depots
and testing facilities). In response to
a request from the Air Force, a committee of the NRC’s Air Force Studies Board held a workshop to discuss
the following questions: (1) What
are the current industrial processes
that are least efficient and most
cost ineffective? (2) What are best
practices in comparable facilities
for comparable processes to achieve
energy efficiency? (3) What are the
potential applications for the best
practices to be found in comparable
facilities for comparable processes to
achieve energy efficiency? (4) What
constraints and considerations might
limit applicability to Air Force facilities and processes over the next 10
years? (5) What are the costs and
paybacks from implementation of
the best practices? (6) What will
be proposed priorities for study and
implementation of the identified
best practices? (7) What does a
holistic representation of energy and
water consumption look like within
operations and maintenance?

Underground Engineering for Sustainable Urban Development. As human
activities begin to change the
planet and populations struggle
to maintain satisfactory standards
of living, the placement of new
infrastructure and related facilities
underground may be the most successful way to encourage or support
sustainable urban development.
But much remains to be learned
about improving the sustainability
of underground infrastructure. At
the request of the National Science
Foundation, the NRC conducted a
study to consider sustainable underground development in the urban
environment, to identify research
needed to maximize opportunities
for using underground space, and to
enhance understanding among the
public and technical communities of
the role of underground engineering
in urban sustainability. This report
explains the findings of researchers
and practitioners with expertise in
geotechnical engineering, underground design and construction,
trenchless technologies, risk assessment, visualization techniques for
geotechnical applications, sustainable infrastructure development,
life cycle assessment, infrastructure
policy and planning, and fire prevention, safety, and ventilation in
the underground.

Nuclear Physics: Exploring the Heart
of the Matter. This report provides
a long-term assessment of nuclear
physics, articulating the scientific
rationale and objectives of the
field, providing a global context for
the field and its long-term priorities, and proposing a framework for
progress through 2020 and beyond.
The committee carefully considered the balance between universities and government facilities in
terms of research and workforce
development and the role of international collaborations in leveraging future investments. Nuclear
physics encompasses research that
spans dimensions from a tiny fraction of the volume of the individual
particles (neutrons and protons) in
the atomic nucleus to the enormous
scales of astrophysical objects in the
cosmos. This report explains the
research objectives, which include
the desire not only to better understand the nature of matter interacting at the nuclear level but also to
describe the state of the universe
that existed at the big bang.

Zero-Sustainment Aircraft for the US
Air Force: A Workshop Summary. Air
Force weapon system sustainment
(WSS) costs are growing at more
than 4 percent per year, while budgets have remained essentially flat.
The cost growth is due partly to
aging of the aircraft fleet and partly
to the cost of supporting higherperformance aircraft and the new
capabilities of more complex and
sophisticated systems, such as the
latest intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance platforms. Further-

more, sustainment budgets are likely
to decrease, so that the gap between
budgets and sustainment needs
will likely grow wider. The original
intent of this 3-day workshop was
to focus on ways that science and
technology (S&T) could help the
Air Force reduce sustainment costs.
However, as the workshop evolved,
discussions focused increasingly on
Air Force leadership, management
authority, and culture as the more
critical factors that need to change
in order to solve sustainment problems. Many participants felt that
while S&T investments could certainly help—particularly if applied
in the early stages of the product
life cycle—it would be more useful
to adopt a transformational management approach that defines the
user-driven goals of the enterprise,
empowers people to achieve them,
and holds them accountable, down
to the shop level.

Transitions to Alternative Vehicles
and Fuels. For a century, almost all
light-duty vehicles (LDVs) have
been powered by internal combustion engines operating on petroleum
fuels. Now energy security concerns
over petroleum imports and the effect
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
on global climate are driving interest
in alternatives. This report assesses
the potential for reducing petroleum

<-----Page 83----->The

consumption and GHG emissions
by 80 percent across the US LDV
fleet by 2050, relative to 2005. It
examines the current capability
and estimated future performance
and costs for each vehicle type as
well as non-petroleum-based fuel
technology as options that could
significantly contribute to these
goals. The report also identifies barriers to implementation of these
technologies and suggests policies
to achieve the desired reductions.
Approaches such as research and
development, subsidies, energy taxes, or regulations will be necessary to
overcome barriers such as cost and
consumer choice.

Assessment of Advanced Solid State
Lighting. The standard incandescent light bulb, which still works
mainly as Thomas Edison invented
it, converts more than 90 percent of
the consumed electricity into heat.
With newer lighting technologies
that convert a greater percentage
of electricity into useful light, there
is potential to decrease the amount
of energy used for lighting in both
commercial and residential applications. Although technologies

such as compact fluorescent lamps
will help increase energy efficiency,
solid-state lighting (SSL) stands
to help dramatically decrease US
energy consumption for lighting.
This report summarizes the current
status of SSL technologies and products—light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
and organic LEDs—and evaluates
barriers to their improved cost and
performance. It also discusses factors
involved in achieving widespread
deployment and consumer acceptance of SSL products, such as the
perceived quality of light emitted by
SSL devices, ease of use and the useful lifetime of these devices, initial
high cost, and possible benefits of
reduced energy consumption.

science, engineering, and technology across the federal government.
The NRC’s third triennial review of
the NNI concerned three areas: Task
1—Examine the role of the NNI in
maximizing opportunities to transfer
selected technologies to the private
sector, assess how well the NNI is
carrying out this role, and suggest
new mechanisms to foster transfer of
technologies and improvements to
NNI operations in this area where
warranted. Task 2—Assess the suitability of current procedures and criteria for determining progress toward
NNI goals, suggest definitions of
success and associated metrics, and
provide advice on organizations
(government or nongovernment)
that could perform evaluations of
progress. Task 3—Review NNI’s
management and coordination of
nanotechnology research across
both civilian and military federal
agencies. This interim report offers
initial comments on the procedures
and criteria for determining progress toward and achievement of the
desired outcomes.

Alternatives for Managing the Nation’s
Complex Contaminated Groundwater Sites. Across the United States,
thousands of hazardous waste sites
are contaminated with chemicals
that prevent the underlying groundwater from meeting drinking water
standards. These include Superfund
sites and other facilities that handle and dispose of hazardous waste,
active and inactive dry cleaners, and
leaking underground storage tanks;
many are at federal facilities such
as military installations. This report
estimates that at least 126,000 sites
still have contaminated groundwater, and their closure is expected to
cost as much as $127 billion. About
10 percent of these sites are considered “complex,” meaning restoration
is unlikely to be achieved in the next
50 to 100 years because of technological limitations. At sites where
contaminant concentrations have
plateaued at levels above cleanup
goals despite active efforts, the report
recommends evaluating whether
they should transition to long-term
management, where risks would be
monitored and harmful exposures
prevented, but at reduced costs.

Optics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation. Optics and
photonics technologies are ubiquitous: they are responsible for the
displays on smart phones and computing devices, optical fiber that
carries information in the Internet,

advanced precision manufacturing, enhanced defense capabilities,
and a host of medical diagnostics
tools. And they offer the potential
for even greater societal impact in
the next few decades, including
solar power generation and efficient lighting that could transform
the nation’s energy landscape, and
new optical capabilities that will be
essential to support the continued
exponential growth of the Internet.
This report assesses the current state
of optical science and engineering
in the United States and abroad in
terms of market trends, workforce
needs, and the impact of photonics
on the national economy. It identifies technological opportunities that
have arisen from recent advances in
and applications of optical science
and engineering. The report also
calls for improved management of
US public and private research and
development resources, emphasizing the need for public policy that
encourages a portfolio approach to
investing in the opportunities available in photonics.
