Abstract
Decision-making processes employed by venture capitalists (VCs) varying in experience were
compared. Results show that for relatively inexperienced VCs, increasing experience is associated with
improvements in reliability and performance relative to a benchmark (a bootstrapping model). Beyond
a specific point, however, further gains in experience are associated with actual reductions in reliability
and performance. Thus, greater experience at the venture capital task may not always result in better
decisions.

they gain increasing experience in performing various tasks. For instance, they become more
efficient by learning to focus attention primarily on the key dimensions and learn to ignore
extraneous variables. Taken together, this evidence suggests that experienced decision-makers
in a given task may indeed utilize superior decision processes relative to those with less
experience and, by extrapolation, that venture capitalists (VCs) may become more accurate in
choosing the ‘‘right’’ companies as their experience increases.
However, past research in the area of judgment/decision-making suggests that increasing
experience does not always lead to better decisions. For instance, experienced decisionmakers appear to rely on various heuristics and other forms of mental shortcuts to the same
extent as those lacking experience and this can lead them into equally serious errors. They are
more likely to suffer from overconfidence and ‘‘overfitting’’ the world by drawing
conclusions based on small samples of experience and overgeneralizing from them and they
may be less likely to engage in counterfactual thinking (contemplating ‘‘what might have
been’’), thus failing to attain important insights into how performance in various situations
can be improved in the future. Thus, experienced decision-makers may become increasingly
trapped in current modes of thought and may fail to develop better decision policies that can
improve future performance.
How can these two seemingly contradictory literatures be reconciled? We propose that the
answer may involve a curvilinear relationship between experience with the venture capital
task and the accuracy or efficiency of their decision processes. We found that as decisionmakers’ experience increases, intrajudge reliability at first increases but then decreases. The
performance relative to a bootstrapping model shows a similar rising and then declining
function. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a curvilinear relationship
between experience in the venture capital task and decision performance (at least in terms of
process).
The curvilinear nature of the relationship between experience and decision-making
effectiveness raises an important question: What factors are responsible for the decline in
decision effectiveness once VCs attain what seems to be an optimal level of experience
(approximately 14 years of venture capital experience in our data)? One possibility is that
beyond this optimal point, VCs, like other highly experienced decision-makers, begin to rely
on automatic information processing to such an extent that they become increasingly
susceptible to various sources of cognitive error. Instead of evaluating all of the pieces of
information surrounding the proposed venture, experienced VCs may focus on those
characteristics that match past successes or failures. In other words, they may show increased
susceptibility to an availability bias. To the extent this is so, the key to improving
experienced VCs’ decision processes may lie in reducing this reliance on automatic
processing—somehow ‘‘forcing them outside their comfort zones.’’ A number of actions
can be taken to rejuvenate the VCs’ process, including requiring them (at least occasionally)
to make decisions outside their regular domain, asking them to justify their decisions in front
of other VCs, using bootstrap decision aids and encouraging them to engage in counterfactual thinking. It is our hope that the findings reported here will help increase experienced
VCs’ awareness of the fact that their experience is a two-edged sword that can, under varying
conditions, increase as well as reduce their risk of error with respect to important decisions.

2. Introduction
The power to guess the unseen from the seen, to trace the implications of things, to judge the
whole piece by the pattern. . .this cluster of gifts may almost be said to constitute experience.
Henry James (1888)
Common wisdom, like the above quotation, suggests that growing discernment comes with
experience. Applying this dictum to entrepreneurship, it seems reasonable to suggest that as
VCs gain experience, their decision-making processes improve. However, does more venture
capital experience always provide better decisions? To the best knowledge of the authors, this
idea has not been systematically investigated. Moreover, literature in related fields offers a
somewhat contradictory picture with respect to addressing this question.
On the one hand, past research on the effects of expertise suggests that individuals often do
acquire important advantages as they gain increasing experience in performing various tasks.
For instance, as individuals become more experienced with respect to a particular task, they
tend to become increasingly efficient in several ways. They learn to focus attention primarily on
the key dimensions—the ones that contribute most variance to the outcome of decisions (Chase
and Simon, 1973; Choo and Trotman, 1991; Weber, 1980). Experienced decision-makers create
categories of information based on a deep structure that involves more and stronger links
between concepts (Gobbo and Chi, 1986). They also adopt decision policies that utilize a rich
connection among concepts (Chi and Koeske, 1983; Frederick, 1991; Frederick and Libby,
1986). Taken together, this evidence suggests that decision-makers experienced in a given task
may indeed utilize superior decision processes relative to those with less experience (Anderson,
1983; Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1986; Nosofsky, 1984, 1986, 1987) and, by extrapolation, that VCs
may become more accurate in choosing the ‘‘right’’ companies as their experience increases.
On the other hand, past research in the area of judgment/decision-making suggests that
increasing experience does not always lead to better decisions (e.g., Camerer and Johnson,
1991; Einhorn, 1974). This may be true for several reasons. First, experienced decisionmakers appear to rely on various heuristics and other forms of mental shortcuts to the same
extent as those lacking experience and this can lead them into equally serious errors (Libby
and Lewis, 1982; Roose and Doherty, 1976; Ullman and Doherty, 1984). Similarly, with high
levels of experience, decision-makers may become increasingly susceptible to the pitfall of
cognitive or mental ruts. In short, their thoughts may tend to become increasingly channeled
by their past experience. Such effects may make it more difficult for them to recognize new
variables or to notice that the situation has changed and thus requires new approaches
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974).
Third, experienced decision-makers may suffer from overconfidence—a tendency to
overestimate the likelihood of a set of events (Fischhoff, 1982; Mahajan, 1992; Oskamp,
1982). Such effects have recently been observed among experienced VCs (Zacharakis and
Shepherd, 2001). Fourth, experienced decision-makers might ‘‘overfit’’ the world by drawing
conclusions based on small samples of experience and overgeneralizing from them (Mahajan,
1992). Finally, because they are highly familiar with certain kinds of situations and the range
of outcomes likely to be experienced in them, experienced decision-makers may be less likely

<-----Page 3----->384

D.A. Shepherd et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 381–401

to engage in counterfactual thinking—imagining outcomes other than the ones that actually
occurred in a given situation (e.g., Roese, 1997). While counterfactual thinking can generate
strong feelings of regret and other negative outcomes, it can also assist individuals in
formulating more effective strategies for attaining better outcomes (Baron, 1998, 2000). Thus,
to the extent experienced decision-makers are less likely than novices to engage in counterfactual thinking, they may tend to become increasingly trapped in current modes of thought
and may fail to develop better decision policies that can improve future performance.
How can these two seemingly contradictory literatures be reconciled? One approach
suggests that much depends on the type of task being performed (Shanteau, 1992; Spence and
Brucks, 1997). In other words, experience will improve performance for some types of tasks
but not others. VCs operate in an information-rich and highly uncertain environment, which
often strains their information processing capacity and involves high levels of emotion and
extreme time constraints. Under such conditions, we propose that highly experienced VCs
come to make their decisions more intuitively rather than by a conscious series of decision
steps.3 In the language of cognitive psychology, they make their decision in a more automatic
manner—that is, through automatic processing rather than through more conscious, step-bystep systematic processing (e.g., Logan, 1990). While automatic processing (and decisionmaking) is often faster than systematic processing, it can prove detrimental to the reliability of
decisions and to performance relative to a bootstrapping model. It has often been noted, for
instance, that VCs are intuitive decision-makers (Khan, 1987; MacMillan et al., 1987;
Zacharakis and Shepherd, 2001) and that this intuition develops after making numerous
venture investment decisions.
There is theoretical support suggesting that as VCs shift toward automatic processing, they
devote less effort to systematically evaluating each component factor and respond instead to a
‘‘gestalt’’—an overall often gut-level impression of available information (Zacharakis and
Shepherd, 2001). A large body of empirical evidence in cognitive science suggests that shifts
toward automatic processing occur in a wide range of situations and are, to a large degree,
inexorable. Human beings often tend to operate as ‘‘cognitive misers,’’ exerting as little
cognitive effort as possible in a wide range of contexts (cf. Fiske and Taylor, 1991). Thus,
thinking in detail about various decision criteria requires a great deal of cognitive effort—
much more than proceeding on the basis of an ‘‘overall impression’’ of available data. As a
result of these processes, VCs come to rely, to an increasing degree, on their ‘‘efficient’’
information processing strategy and begin to invest less cognitive effort. Less cognitive effort
can lead to a heightened susceptibility to the various cognitive pitfalls outlined above.4
Therefore, beyond some measurable optimal level, the benefits of experience in reducing
the cognitive effort required to make an assessment may be exceeded by the potential costs of
reduced investment of cognitive effort in the decision-making task, with detrimental effects
on ultimate decision quality.

For further discussion on the investigation of information processing capacity, high levels of emotion and
extreme time constraints, see Baron (1998, 2000).

We propose that automatic processing may introduce cognitive errors but do not propose that this process is
universally equated with cognitive error.

385

The major prediction of this study then is that where VCs are concerned, experience does
count, but the relationship between growing experience and decision processes may well be
curvilinear in nature. In other words, initially, growing experience enhances VCs’ decisionmaking capabilities. Beyond some point, however, additional experience may begin to exert
detrimental effects in this respect.
This prediction, in turn, raises a key issue: How can VCs’ decision-making be assessed?
One possibility is to examine their actual decision accuracy: To what extent do they make
good (i.e., accurate or successful) decisions? However, there are daunting obstacles to
determining ‘‘actual’’ decision accuracy. For instance, many unforeseen circumstances can
impact new venture performance during the elapsed time from when a VC makes a decision
to invest and when the outcome of that decision is known (typically a number of years;
Timmons, 1994).
Another approach is to focus on decision processes rather than decision outcomes: the
manner in which VCs combine information to form an overall decision and their performance
relative to a bootstrapping model (the nature of such models is explained below). It is
reasoned here that as decision-makers’ experience increases, we should find that (a) intrajudge reliability at first increases but then decreases, (b) interjudge reliability at first increases
and then decreases and (c) performance relative to a bootstrapping model at first increases and
then decreases.
Consistency or stability in VCs’ decisions can be interpreted as reflecting a superior
decision policy from the perspective of a process-criterion approach. Decision accuracy, in
turn, can be construed as representing decision quality from an outcome-criterion approach.
Unstable judgments have been found to have a detrimental effect on accuracy (Ashton, 1983)
and bootstrapping models, across a wide variety of contexts, have been found to have higher
decision accuracy than experts’ decisions (Camerer, 1981b). Consequently, in this study, we
will focus on three measures of the decision process: reliability, consensus and likely
performance relative to a bootstrapping model. Bootstrapping models aim to capture the
cognitive system of the decision-maker and have been found in a number of studies across a
variety of decision contexts that such models often outperform actual decision-makers
(Camerer, 1981b).
2.1. Experience and decision process performance
Unless a decision-maker can reproduce his or her measurements of the decision criteria,
there is little that can be said in defense of this person’s expertise (Einhorn, 1986, p. 481).
Intrajudge reliability appears to have a positive impact on decision accuracy (Ashton, 1983).5
Empirically, decision quality (expertise) has been found to be associated with reliability
(Shanteau, 1988; Spence and Brucks, 1997; Bedard et al., 1993).
5

Many of these studies have investigated the decision-making of auditors. Auditors are professionals that rely
on their expertise to make assessments about a business performance. While VCs’ assessments may be more
difficult and involve a different set of skills, in many ways, an auditor’s task is similar to that of a VC assessing a
business plan.

<-----Page 5----->386

D.A. Shepherd et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 381–401

Consensus (interjudge reliability) represents the agreement (consistency) among different
decision-makers performing the same task. Einhorn (1974) describes consensus as a
necessary but not sufficient condition for accuracy among a group of expert decision-makers.
Ashton (1985) empirically investigated the relationship between consensus and decision
accuracy in two different decision contexts—a managerial accounting/budgeting context and
an auditing context—and used a variety of measures. Ashton’s study found a consistent and
highly positive relationship between consensus and decision accuracy, indicating the
appropriateness of consensus as a surrogate for accuracy (at least in these contexts). In line
with our proposition of a curvilinear relationship between the quality of the decision process
and experience, we offer the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Experience with the VC task is curvilinearly related to decision (i.e., intrajudge) reliability, showing an inverted U-shaped function.
Hypothesis 2: Experience with the VC task is curvilinearly related to decision consensus
(i.e., interjudge reliability), also showing an inverted U-shaped function.
Researchers who investigate expertise and bootstrapping models assume that a simple
model can be substituted for the intervening decision processes and that the effectiveness
(output) of this simple model can then be compared with the decision effectiveness of actual
decision-makers (Ebert and Kruse, 1978). Bootstrapping models aim to capture the cognitive
system of a decision-maker, including both the decision criteria and the relative weights
actually used in past decisions. Importantly, they utilize only the modeled portion of a
decision-maker’s past assessments—there is no residual variance. A number of studies across
a variety of decision contexts have found that such models often outperform actual decisionmakers (cf. Camerer, 1981b; Dawes, 1971; Osherson et al., 1997; Zacharakis and Meyer,
2000).
How can a bootstrapping model be based on an expert’s decision policy (i.e., on the criteria
and weights used by the expert to reach decisions) yet outperform the expert on whom the
bootstrapping model is based? This depends on the predictive validity of the actual decision’s
residual variance—that is, the extent to which it is related to the criterion variable: new
venture profitability. The sources of residual variance include (a) random variations in human
judgment, (b) cue nonlinearity and interactions not captured in the bootstrapping model and
(c) use of cues not specified in the bootstrapping model (Camerer, 1981a,b; Einhorn, 1974).
Unlike the other two sources, random variation in human judgment (error variance) is
unrelated to the criterion variable—it has no predictive properties.
Therefore, if the residual variance of an actual decision consists entirely of error
variance, bootstrapping models will always outperform the decision-maker (Camerer,
1981b; Dawes, 1971; Osherson et al., 1997). If error variance is less than residual variance,
then some portion of the residual variance will be systematic: it will be correlated, either
directly or indirectly, with the criterion variable. We assume that the correlation will be
direct—that is, we give the systematic variance the benefit of the doubt. Even so, if the
greater portion of the residual variance is error variance, the model will outperform the
decision-maker.

<-----Page 6----->D.A. Shepherd et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 381–401

387

The above approach does not require a measure of prediction accuracy. Such an approach
is particularly important, as bootstrapping models are most useful in judgment situations
where environmental structures are unknown or criterion information is vague. Under such
circumstances, it is difficult to pretest prediction methods, then apply them in practice to
predict new cases (authors’ names withheld, 2000). Camerer (1981b) provides theoretical,
analytical and empirical support for the use of this bootstrapping approach to assess decision
performance. He states: ‘‘In a blind application, one can be fairly confident that bootstrapping
will be a useful method of judgment improvement, particularly when criterion information is
vague or the prediction environment is unspecified’’ (p. 420).
Therefore, if we can show how a decision-maker performs relative to his/her bootstrapping
model, we will obtain convincing evidence about the quality of the decisions reached by this
person (Camerer, 1981a). Those VCs that perform well relative to their bootstrapping models
(models from which error variance—random variation in human judgment—has been
removed) will attain higher decision quality than those who do not. (A low ratio score
represents high performance relative to a bootstrapping model.) Thus,
Hypothesis 3: Experience with the VC task is curvilinearly related to performance relative to
bootstrapping models—showing an inverted U-shaped function.
In sum, the present research is designed to examine the effects of VCs’ experience on three
aspects of their decision-making. The major proposition is that as experience increases,
decision performance (as assessed by specific decision processes) at first increases but then,
beyond some point, decreases (i.e., a curvilinear relationship). More specifically, as proposed
above, increases in experience are predicted to be associated with an initial increase and then
a decrease in (1) decision reliability, (2) decision consensus and (3) performance relative to
bootstrapping models.

3. Method
This study follows suggestions by Shepherd and Zacharakis (1997) that VCs’ assessments
of new venture proposals can be investigated through a decision-making framework. Conjoint
analysis is a general term referring to a technique that requires respondents to make a series of
judgments based on profiles from which their ‘‘captured’’ decision processes can be
decomposed into their underlying structure, i.e., the attributes’ significance in the judgment,
how these attributes affect the judgment and the relative importance of each attribute in the
decision process. A profile is simply a combination of all the attributes where each attribute is
described by one of its levels (a level is an assigned value for an attribute).
Conjoint analysis and policy capturing have been used in hundreds of studies of judgment
and decision-making (Stewart, 1988; Green and Srinivasan, 1990). These studies vary from
research into VCs’ assessment of a new venture’s performance (Muzyka et al., 1996;
Zacharakis and Meyer, 1998; Shepherd, 1999), manager’s strategic decisions (Priem, 1994;
Hitt et al., 2000) and expert judgment (Davis, 1996). For example, Bonner (1990) used

<-----Page 7----->388

D.A. Shepherd et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 381–401

conjoint analysis to investigate the relationship between experience and an auditor’s
assessment of risk. Conjoint analysis represents a robust technique for decision modeling
research providing structured insight into VCs’ decision policies.6 This study’s research
method is now detailed.
3.1. Sampling plan, survey method and sample
The 1996 Australian Venture Capital Guide (Pollitecon Publications, 1996), a comprehensive guide to Australia’s venture capital industry, and the 1995 Australian Development
Capital Directory (Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology, 1995) were
used to identify potential firms and participants. Firms listed in either guide and based in
Australia with preferred investments in seed, startup and/or development capital were
considered as the sampling frame of VCs in Australia. The senior executives of each firm
in the sampling plan were targeted for this study. It is estimated the Australian venture capital
industry consists of 65 private venture capital firms7 with a total of 350 professional staff, $4
billion invested capital, $1 billion available capital, a current portfolio of 958 companies and
655 completed investments (Pollitecon Publications, 1996).
Two methods of data collection were used: (1) experiment collected by author and (2)
experiment sent by mail. For reasons of resource efficiency, the author personally collected
only those responses from VCs located in Australia’s three largest cities. Analysis of variance
was performed on the importance weights of those responses collected through mail and
those collected by the author. The two methods of data collection were not significantly
different. Consequently, the two groups of responses were treated as one.
Sixty-six individual VCs representing 47 venture capital firms completed the survey, thus
providing an excellent sample of Australia’s most senior VCs with Directors, Managing
Directors, Executive Chairmen, General Managers and CEOs representing 52% of the
sample. Senior managers constitute a further 42% with only 6% of the sample accounted
for by analysts.8 This represents a 65% response rate in terms of participating venture
capital firms and a 19% response rate in terms of total professional VCs.9 A comparison of
VC firms in the study and those that did not participate reveals no significant difference in
the age of the firm, number of professional staff, types of investment, total capital,
completed divestments and current number of portfolio companies (comparison data
obtained from the Australian Venture Capital Guide; Pollitecon Publications, 1996). Given

For a deeper discussion of bootstrapping models, we refer the reader to Shepherd and Zacharakis (2002).
7
There are also six government or semigovernment institutions involved in the equity funding of new
ventures. These six firms were also included in the sampling plan. There was no significant difference in the
decision-making of private and public VCs, although small sample sizes for this statistical test would make it
difficult to detect such a difference.
8
All VCs included in the sample were actively involved in assessing new venture performance.
9
Some firms had more than one VC participate in the study. The results of this study did not vary significantly
when the data were reanalyzed including the responses of only one VC per venture capital firm.

389

the similarity between participating and nonparticipating firms, there is unlikely to be a
nonresponse bias.
3.2. Decision-making task
In this study, respondents evaluated a series of hypothetical conjoint profiles, which
describe new ventures in terms of eight attributes, each with two levels. The levels and
definitions are displayed in Appendix A. Discussions with VCs, accountants and academics
confirmed the face validity for both the attributes and their levels. The VCs were asked to
evaluate each venture based on its description (i.e., the levels of attributes presented) and to
assess its likely profitability.
The attributes used are derived from the strategy literature. Central to an industrial
organization (IO) perspective of strategy is an understanding of the nature of the markets
(Williamson, 1985; Golder and Tellis, 1993), in which a new venture will compete, and the
nature of competitive interactions between firms in those markets (Schmalensee, 1982; Yip,
1982). The management team must then decide where to position the new venture in order to
achieve its competitive advantage (Besanko et al., 1996). We follow the lead of Shepherd et
al. (2000) who operationalize the nature of the markets by the ‘‘stability of the key success
factors’’ and ‘‘the new venture’s timing of entry,’’ the nature of competitive interactions by
‘‘lead time’’ and ‘‘competitive rivalry,’’ the management team by ‘‘educational capability’’
and ‘‘industry related competence’’ and strategic choices by ‘‘scope of market entry’’ and
‘‘mimicry (imitation) of the entry mechanism.’’
Profitability is a commonly used operationalization of new venture performance (Abell and
Hammond, 1979; DeCastro and Chrisman, 1995). Here, profitability was defined as net profit
on sales using a 10-year time horizon. An 11-point Likert type scale was used with end
anchors describing very low profitability and very high profitability. A 10-year time horizon
was chosen to exceed Biggadike’s (1979) and McDougall et al.’s (1994) choice of 8 years to
operationalize a new venture, as it appears reasonable to assume that 10 years captures
sustainable performance.10
3.3. Research instrument
The research instrument contained a cover letter, task instructions, the conjoint decisionmaking task and a postexperiment questionnaire. Relevant term definitions were also
included on a detachable sheet that could be referred to while completing the survey. The
instrument also stated that the subject was to confine her/his decision based upon the criteria

10
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between experience and process measures of
decision quality. See Shepherd et al. (2000) for a description of the relationship between these attributes of entry
strategy and VCs’ assessment of profitability. The results of this study did not differ substantially when the
interactions proposed in Shepherd et al. (2000) were included. This is not surprising considering the low relative
importance of the interactions in that study.

<-----Page 9----->390

included and all other factors were constant across scenarios. Once instructions were
understood, respondents considered each conjoint venture description and provided a rating
on an 11-point scale for likely profitability. In the postexperiment questionnaire, the VCs
were asked to rate the importance of the attributes in making an assessment of profitability on
an 11-point scale anchored by the labels ‘‘very low, unimportant’’ to ‘‘very important.’’ The
mean response and standard deviations suggest that all attributes are at least somewhat
important.11
An experiment with a fully crossed factorial design involving eight attributes at two levels
will require 256 profiles. An orthogonal fractional factorial design was used to reduce the
number of attribute combinations and thus the decision-making task to a more manageable
number (Green and Srinivasan, 1990). The orthogonal design meant that any level of one
attribute could be combined with any level on another attribute. Therefore, there is no
intercorrelation between the decision criteria presented to the VCs. Such an approach,
however, can potentially lead to the presentation of a case that simply does not exist in the
VC’s experience, resulting in possible inconsistency. The instrument was pretested with a VC
and accountants in the entrepreneurship division of a ‘‘Big Six’’ accounting firm to test for
unrealistic cases. All cases were deemed realistic.12
The general rule in selecting an experimental design for conjoint analysis is to
confound effects of most interest with effects that are unlikely to be significant or, if
they are significant, is unlikely to cause much bias in the parameters that are estimated
(Louviere, 1988). The Hahn and Shapiro (1966) experimental fractional factorial design
used in this study requires 16 profiles to confound the effects of most interest with those
of least interest. These 16 profiles were fully replicated and then randomly assigned to
avoid order effects and are displayed in Appendix B. A practice profile and six holdout
profiles were also used. The practice profile familiarized respondents with the task and the
six holdout profiles were not used in this study. Therefore, the experiment presented
subjects with 39 profiles to evaluate. The experimental design enabled both individual
subject and aggregate subject level analysis. Each of the 16 profiles was fully replicated,
permitting estimates of individual subject error for use in subsequent OLS regression.
Another experiment was constructed, which had a different order of attributes within a
profile and a different order of profiles. The results for the two experiments did not
significantly vary.
Fatigue is unlikely to be of concern in this experiment. First, the number of attributes in
each treatment is relatively low (Hitt et al., 2000 has 30 profiles with 14 attributes) and the
mean time taken to complete the experiment was less than thirty minutes. Second, the order
of the profiles was different for two experiments and the results were consistent across

Timing with a mean of 7.7 (standard deviation of 2.5), scope with 7.4 (2.0), mimicry with 6.4 (2.8), lead
time with 7.9 (2.2), key success factor stability with 7.2 (2.2), educational capability with 7.3 (2.6), competitive
rivalry with 9.2 (1.9) and industry-related competence with 9.2 (2.0).

profiles.

these two instruments. Third, individuals were relatively consistent in their responses
[median test–retest reliability of 0.65; 94% of the VCs had significantly reliable responses
( P < .05)].
3.4. Variables and analysis
Experience was measured by the number of years that a decision-maker had worked as a
VC [mean of 8.01 years (standard deviation of 6.87)].13 Three process measures of decision
quality were employed (reliability, consensus and performance) relative to a bootstrapping
model. Reliability of responses for each individual provides an indication of the consistency
with which they apply their decision-making strategies. Sixteen replicated profiles were
evaluated with the 16 original/identical cases and were used in a test–retest measure using
Pearson R correlations. Discussions with respondents indicated they were unaware that cases
had been repeated. The mean was .67 (.14). Consensus among members within a level of
experience was tested using the mean Pearson R correlation between each individual’s
observed score and each other individual [mean of .30 (.12)]. Regression was used to test the
significance and nature of the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between experience and
both reliability and consensus.
To investigate the performance of a decision-maker relative to a bootstrapping model
requires an investigation of the ratio of error variance to residual variance (Camerer, 1981a,b).
The amount of error variance is estimated using a test–retest measure of reliability. If there is
no error, then the test–retest reliability is 1.00. If the decision is completely random, then the
test–retest is 0. Therefore, the error variance is calculated by subtracting the test–retest
reliability from 1.00. Because the residual variance is one minus the explained variance, the
ratio of error variance to residual variance gives the percentage of residual variance due to
random error (Camerer, 1981a).14
If this ratio is close to 1, then most of the residual variance is random error. If the ratio is
close to 0, then most of the variance is systematic (nonrandom) error—there is systematic
information contained in the residual variance. Thus, a high ratio suggests that bootstrapping
models will outperform the decision-maker and a low ratio is necessary for experts to
outperform or match the performance of the bootstrapping models. The mean for the sample
was 0.65 (0.21). Regression was used to test the significance and nature of the hypothesized
curvilinear relationship between experience and performance relative to a bootstrapping
model. The value inflation factors (VIFs) were at an acceptable level (under 10), indicating
that any correlation between experience and experience squared was unlikely to confound the
results.

13
While most studies operationalize experience in terms of the number of years performing a task, the quality
of that experience is also likely to impact the decision process. Results should not be generalized beyond the years
of experience in the VC task. In addition, experience was not significantly correlated with the VC’s age (R2=.23,
p=.213).
14
Ratios that exceeded 1 (due to rounding and low reliability) were replaced with the maximum score of 1.00.

4. Results
The results of the regression analyses relating to level of experience and decision process
are displayed in Table 1. For Model 1, the regression coefficients are positive for experience
( P < .01) and negative for experience squared ( p < .01) and explain a significant portion of
the variance in VCs’ reliability (R2=.224, p < .01). The findings suggest that the nature of the
relationship between reliability and experience is curvilinear and shows the predicted inverted
U-shaped relationship. At first, increasing experience is associated with increased reliability,
but at higher levels of experience, further increments in this variable are associated with
decreased reliability. (The optimal experience level for maximum reliability is approximately
13 years.) Because high reliability is associated with a better decision process, it appears that,
consistent with Hypothesis 1, there is indeed an optimal level of experience. However, there
is no support for Hypothesis 2, which predicts a curvilinear relationship between experience
and consensus.
For Model 3, the regression coefficients are negative for experience ( P < .01) and
positive for experience squared ( p < .01) and explain a significant portion of the variance
in VCs’ performance relative to a bootstrapping model (R2=.224, p < .01). A low ratio
score is associated with a better decision process. Thus, once again, there appears to be
an optimal level of experience and the relationship between performance and experience
is curvilinear in form, showing the predicted inverted U-shaped function. At first,
increasing experience is associated with increased performance relative to a bootstrapping
model, but at higher levels of experience, further increments are associated with reduced
performance ( p < .01). (The optimal experience level for maximum performance relative to

a bootstrapping model is approximately 15 years.) These findings provide support for
Hypothesis 3.
An alternate explanation for our findings of curvilinear relationships between experience
and decision processes is that experienced VCs were using more complex decision policies
than were not being captured by our main-effects-only models.15 Shepherd et al. (2000)
theoretically justify the inclusion of four interactions, namely, timing with key success factor
stability, lead time, competitive rivalry and educational capability. Our results did not differ
significantly when these interactions were included. First, there was no significant difference
in the use of interactions across levels of experience (high, medium and low). Second, there
was no significant difference in the use of interactions across other VC characteristics: stage
of investment, level of technology of investment and the VC’s age.
Our findings of nonsignificance do not necessarily rule out this alternate explanation that
more complex decisions were being used—our tests could have lacked sufficient power to
find significance or VCs were using interactions that were not tested for. However, a lack of
power is unlikely to be the cause given that the number of significant interactions only
increased from 28 using a p-value of .05 to 44 using a p-value of .10. Furthermore, the results
reported above did not significantly differ when the higher number of interactions (44) was
included in the analysis. Finally, age, stage of investment and technology were each
individually added as a control variable for each of the three models and the results did
not significantly change and none of these control variables were significant.
As for the possibility that VCs were using nonlinear decision policies other than those
being tested, we argue based on Shepherd et al. that there is no theoretical reason to expect
that other interactions would be used by the sample. Finally, based on the interactions tested,
there is not a significant increasing tendency to use nonlinear thinking with experience or
other VC characteristics. Therefore, we have made a relatively strong case for our findings
using main-effects-only models.16

5. Discussion and conclusion
5.1. Experience and quality of VC’s decision process
This study was designed to provide evidence relevant to the following important question:
Does increasing experience improve a VC’s decision process? As hypothesized, experience is
indeed beneficial to VC decision-making, but only up to a point. At low levels of experience,
decision-makers face greater information overload because they are less experienced with the
15

The decision process measures are not significantly correlated to the number of main effects in a VC’s
decision policy ( p < .05). The results did not differ significantly when the number of main effects used in a
decision policy was included as a control variable in each model.
16
There is a possibility that VCs’ decision policies could differ based the age of the VC firm. While these data
were available at the aggregate level for those that responded to the survey and those that did not, VC firm age was
not collected for each individual and therefore could not be controlled for when analyzing VCs’ decision policies.

<-----Page 13----->394

decision process and structure. Consequently, reliability suffers and the residual variance of
the VC’s decision policy is primarily composed of error variance-poor performance relative to
a bootstrapping model. As experience increases, however, VCs acquire growing understanding of the relationships between various factors and new venture success. This reduces their
overall cognitive load and results in improvements in reliability and performance relative to a
bootstrapping model. As experience continues to grow beyond this point, however, our
findings suggest that both decision reliability and performance relative to a bootstrapping
model decrease.
At first glance, it was somewhat surprising that Hypothesis 2, which focused on decision
consensus, was not supported. As noted above, there was no indication of a curvilinear
relationship between VC experience and interrater consensus. Upon further reflection, this is
not so surprising. Although Ashton (1985) found that auditors had high interjudge reliability,
this finding may not hold across different decision domains. For example, Shanteau (1992)
points out that expert decision accuracy is higher when experts are making decisions about
concrete objective factors than when experts rely on intangible subjective information.
Whereas accounting has very specific numeric relationships, judgments about new ventures
rely on subjective assessments regarding the market, team, etc. In the VC decision context,
there may be different paths to the same end decision and therefore the same decision quality.
Even slight variations in decision strategies, however, can result in low consensus, even if a
group of independent VCs comes to the same end solution. Thus, consensus may not be a
good process measure of accuracy in the VC domain.
5.2. Future research
These empirical relationships raise an intriguing question: Why, precisely, do decision
processes begin to decline among highly experienced VCs—those with 14 or more years of
venture capital experience? We have suggested that after approximately 14 years of
experience, the benefits of reduced cognitive effort required to perform the task are not, in
themselves, sufficient to compensate for a reduced investment of cognitive effort and a
growing tendency toward automatic or heuristic processing of information concerning new
ventures (see, e.g., Eagly and Chakien, 1998; Petty et al., 1994). Highly experienced VCs
may drift, over time, into greater use of processing modes, such as using simple rules of
thumb or mental shortcuts to reach decisions about complex matters. Future research needs to
further investigate these relationships. For example, are the requirements of cognitive effort
and/or the investments of cognitive effort different as experience increases? Such an empirical
test requires measures of cognitive effort required by a task and a person’s level of cognitive
investment. For example, the time taken to conduct a task might be measures as a proxy for
cognitive effort. Research addressing these issues will make a substantial contribution to the
literature.
Furthermore, Bonner (1990) suggests that the role of task-specific knowledge could differ
between attribute selections and attribute weighting. In this study, we investigated attribute
weighting. Future research should investigate the role of experience in the selection of
attributes in the VCs’ assessment process.

It should be noted that due to the small size of Australian VC firms relative to those in the
US, all VCs, regardless of how senior, were actively involved in assessing new ventures. In
the US, however, those VCs with high experience often become managing directors, which
involves activities other than directly assessing a deal (especially in the largest firms). If, as
the saying goes, ‘‘you cannot teach an old dog new tricks,’’ then the results of this study
suggest that this change in responsibilities may be a wise choice. However, we believe that all
but the most rigid VCs can adapt their decision process. Doing so, however, may require
heightened self-insight into these processes—an outcome, which, we believe, can be
encouraged by a number of procedures.
5.3. Procedures for heightened self-insight
To the extent the reasoning offered above is accurate, it suggests that one important key to
improving an experienced VC’s decision process may lie in somehow inducing them to
process information about new ventures systematically instead of automatically. This can be
accomplished by somehow inducing them to operate outside their ‘‘comfort zone’’—outside
the realm of knowledge with which they are most familiar. Doing so should reduce their
reliance on automatic processing. However, how can VCs—especially highly experienced
ones—be induced to operate outside their preferred realm or ‘‘comfort zone’’?
One technique, found to be useful in preventing the automatic processing that often underlies
racial or ethnic prejudice, involves inducing the persons involved to focus on the specific
attributes of individuals rather than on their membership in a given social group or category
(e.g., Neuberg, 1989). By extrapolation, similar techniques could be used to induce VCs to
think about the specific attributes or unique features of plans for new ventures as well as
thinking about them as representatives of discrete cognitive categories (e.g., Internet companies, software companies, consumer product companies, etc.). Focusing on the unique features of
new ventures might well reverse the drift toward increasingly automatic or heuristic driven
decision-making by VCs and so improve their ultimate performance in this important role.
Another approach would be to have VCs make decisions, on occasion, about ventures
outside of the industries on which they usually focus. For example, if a VC has spent a career
focusing on biotechnology deals, have that person take a lead on the newest business-tobusiness (B2B) Internet prospect. It is less likely that VCs will quickly reach a ‘‘first
impression’’ that will bias the overall decision. Instead, they may be more inclined to look at
the component parts of the decision—‘‘Is this the right team? Is this industry space attractive?
etc.’’ By consciously ‘‘decomposing’’ the decision into component parts and then ‘‘recombining’’ numerous small decisions into an overall invest or not invest decision, the VC may
rejuvenate their understanding of their own decision process.17 Then, when they return to the
17

For this decision the VC might be considered more like a novice than an expert might. This brings up an
issue of the type of experience. In this study, we investigated experience in the VC industry. However, within this
general form of experience are experiences with portfolio companies at specific stages of development and certain
industries as well experiences in specific roles within the VC firm. While we suspect a curvilinear relationship
between these specific experiences and decision performance, it remains an empirical question. Future research
could also compare the optimal industry experience with these other more specific types of experience.

<-----Page 15----->396

domain of their primary expertise, their tendency to engage in automatic processing may be
reduced, at least temporarily.
The very nature of the typical VC screening process may also be structured so as to
push experienced VCs out of their comfort zone. Most VC firms have a Monday
morning meeting where the partners discuss current portfolio companies and also current
prospects. Ideally, the partners would challenge each other’s assumptions in regard to a
certain prospect, and to the extent that happens, it probably forces the lead VC out of
automatic processing. However, this process may not work as smoothly in reality. Our
current results suggest that beyond a certain point (approximately 14 years), experience
begins to hinder effective decision-making. The more experienced a VC, the more likely
he/she is to hold a senior rank in the firm. Thus, it may be difficult for less seasoned
partners to challenge their experienced counterparts, which may lead to groupthink.
Another factor that might hinder the ‘‘airing of new prospects’’ is that an experienced
VC may have already rejected a proposal in which case it is unlikely to make it to the
Monday meeting.
Likewise, incorporating counterfactual thinking into one’s process would also help break
the intuitive process. Counterfactual reasoning refers to imagining events, situations or
circumstances where the current decision assumptions might not hold (Fischhoff and
MacGregor, 1982; Mahajan, 1992; Russo and Schoemaker, 1992). What factors might
suggest that the present decision is incorrect? Has all the available information been correctly
analyzed? Is there additional information that has yet to be uncovered? Might it suggest a
different ‘‘story,’’ one of venture failure? Many VC firms have weekly meetings where each
VC gives a status report of the ventures that (s)he is considering. Arkes et al. (1987) suggest
that this exercise of justifying one’s decision in front of a group will force counterfactual
information to be addressed. Whether individual VCs develop counterfactual information
themselves or whether colleagues raise counterfactual scenarios, this questioning of the
reasons behind a decision should tend to offset some of the apparent costs of increasing
experience.
5.4. Potential limitations
Before concluding, certain limitations of the present study should be noted. First, care must
be taken in generalizing the results of this study beyond Australian VCs. As noted above,
senior Australian VCs actively evaluate deals and this is not necessarily the case in the US.
We would encourage further research on this topic in the US, UK and other VC markets.
Second, VCs’ assessment policies could be nonlinear. As detailed in Section 4, we conducted
a series of tests to suggest that the use of nonlinear decision policies is unlikely to
substantially change the results presented in this paper.
Third, there may be concerns over this study’s use of hypothetical ventures and environments and that providing dichotomous attributes may eliminate perceptual requirements from
the task, thereby placing less emphasis on judges’ ability to extract attribute information.
However, research into a variety of judgments provides evidence that hypothetical representations are useful for capturing real policies (e.g., Chaput de Saintonge and Hathaway,

<-----Page 16----->D.A. Shepherd et al. / Journal of Business Venturing 18 (2003) 381–401

397

1981; Riquelme and Rickards, 1992). Professional judgment may therefore involve some
abstract coding of the cues, similar to that provided by policy capturing tasks (Brehmer and
Brehmer, 1988, p. 89). So, while the information within the decision exercise does not
perfectly mirror the more complex ‘‘real life’’ decision, policy-capturing experiments are still
a valid method for deriving what information decision-makers actually use (Brown, 1972;
Hitt and Middlemist, 1979). Moreover, because the VC decision has a large ‘‘paper’’
component in the real world (i.e., much of the VC’s information comes from business
plans), correlation between the experimental task and the ‘‘real world’’ decision should be
even higher.
Fourth, no direct measure of decision accuracy was obtained. Instead, we focused on the
relationship between VCs’ expertise and decision processes—processes that are known to be
related to decision quality. Such an approach is common in the decision-making literature and
there is empirical support for the relationship between these process measures of decision
performance and decision accuracy (e.g., Ashton, 1985; Camerer, 1981b). Future research
could attempt to cross-validate the present findings with appropriate outcome measures of
decision accuracy. For example, such work could compare the predicted performance with
actual performance and/or compare the decision policies between a VC and a known higher
performer (a high consistency indicates high decision quality). However, it should be noted,
in this context, that outcome measures of decision accuracy are not merely difficult to obtain
and that they suffer from important limitations as well (e.g., the environment is probabilistic
and therefore there is variation in outcomes due to unknown variables, inaccurate feedback
and random error). Finally, there are issues related to the creation of bootstrapping models
including the incorporation of interactions, correlation between cues and nonlinearity. Such a
discussion is beneficial but beyond the scope of this paper. We refer the reader to Shepherd
and Zacharakis (2002).
5.5. Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that experience is curvilinearly related to the quality of
VCs’ decision process. Inexperienced VCs as well as highly experienced VCs seem to make
decisions in less reliable or effective ways than moderately experienced VCs. The reasons for
the relatively poor performance may vary between the two groups. For inexperienced VCs,
relative unfamiliarity with the decision structure contributes to errors in judgment as they
struggle with all the available information surrounding the decision. On the other hand,
highly experienced VCs have streamlined their decision process to the point where it is highly
automatic and driven by intuition and heuristic processing. As a result, the decisions of highly
experienced VCs may be susceptible to various forms of bias and error.
