Abstract
We examine the impact of business angels on 182 Series A financings and subsequent company outcomes. Our studied rounds have a varied mix of business angel and
formal venture capital investors (VCs). We find that when only angels participate in
a financing round and VCs are absent, control rights are more entrepreneur-friendly,
legal expenses are lower, and investors are more geographically proximate to the company. Such angel-backed companies are less likely to fail and are more likely to have a
successful liquidity event. We find that companies financed exclusively by VC investors
also perform well, particularly when deals are large. Companies financed by both angels
and VCs experience inferior outcomes. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs consider
business angels to be preferred investors and VCs investing in small deals face adverse
selection. For larger deals, where deeper-pocket VC participation is required, these
roles reverse and angels face adverse selection when investing alongside powerful VC
syndicates.

Introduction

Private equity investments of individuals (business angels) are believed to represent the
lion’s share of investments in de-novo startups. Yet, due to the paucity of data on angel
financing (Fenn and Liang 1998; Prowse 1998), the nature of angels’ investments in startups
has largely been characterized based on survey evidence (Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 2002).
For instance, the conventional wisdom is that angels tend to invest in early-stage deals, hold
common stock, and exert influence through social networks rather than imposing formal
control rights.
We provide several new insights on angel investing by analyzing a unique sample of stock
purchase agreements and other legal documents pertaining to over 182 “Series A” private
equity deals. Our data are derived from the electronic records of the now defunct law firm
Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (Brobeck). One important characteristic of these data is the
considerable variation in the extent of angel and VC participation (ranging from all-angel to
all-VC financings).1 We find new relationships between investor mix and liquidation rights,
redemption rights, investor proximity and attorney billable hours. We also find that investor
mix has a systematic association with success.
A central limitation in studying angels has been the difficulty in providing a meaningful
comparison between angels and VCs, which requires identifying samples of deals for which
both angels and VCs competed. Several characteristics of our data allow us to overcome this
limitation. First, the companies in our sample, including those financed by angels, inhabit
the traditional VC domains of information-technology and biotechnology. Second, Brobeck,
which handled all deals in our sample, was highly prominent. This suggests that the deals
surpassed a minimum quality threshold in the sense that Brobeck “certified” the opportunity.
Megginson and Weiss (1991) and Brav and Gompers (1997) use a similar logic to explain the
link between VC financing and successful IPOs. Third, the size of the angel investments in
our sample overlaps with the smaller VC investments; entrepreneurs in our sample did raise
similar investment amounts from both investor types. Finally, we focus exclusively on Series
A deals. Thus, for a large share of the deals in our sample, entrepreneurs had a meaningful
choice between both investor types. This allows us to understand how angels compete with
VCs, how they participate on the margin, and the implications of their participation.
The prevailing belief that angels simultaneously invest in very early stage deals but
demand fewer controls over their investments is particularly intriguing considering that
investments in small private firms are beset by problems of information asymmetry and
1

This is a key distinction between our work and Wong (2002), who conditions on angel participation
in a deal. Analyses of private equity investment returns by Cochrane (2005), Hall and Woodward (2006),
Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu (2007), Kaplan and Schoar (2005), Ljungqvist and Richardson (2003) and
Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) are based generally on investments by VCs or holdings of small
privately-held businesses.

<-----Page 2----->misaligned incentives. The literature on venture capital financing has documented the use
of complex contractual instruments (Gompers 1997; Kaplan and Stromberg 2003), as well as
staging (Gompers 1995), as ways to mitigate these problems. However, similar contractual
and staging arrangements are believed to be absent from angel deals (Wong 2002). We find
that this belief, in its strictest form, does not properly characterize Series A financings. In
Series A rounds, angels typically take preferred shares alongside VC investors. However,
angel participation is also associated with less restrictive control rights. In part, this may
be because the implementation of sophisticated control mechanisms is not cost-effective for
small deals. However, we find that when angels buy preferred stock in Series A rounds,
they systematically have weaker control rights than VCs, even controlling for size. We
also find, controlling for deal size, that angels are more geographically proximate to their
investment targets and that exclusively angel deals have lower legal costs.2 Both geographic
proximity and less reliance on legal services suggest that angel deals are associated with fewer
asymmetric information problems. In particular, geographic proximity is likely associated
with stronger social networks. This will likely lead to less contentious deals, less negotiation,
and less use of billable attorney hours. Our results suggest that angels forgo strong legal
controls because they are less cost-effective for smaller deals and because angels have stronger
social ties to the entrepreneurs in whose companies they invest.3
Given a choice between either angel or VC financing, entrepreneurs may favor angels
because they demand weaker control covenants and may be more patient.4 This implies
a “pecking-order” in which angels are preferred investors. To the degree that angels are
informed, VCs will face an adverse selection problem because they are second in the pecking
order. Supportive of this story, we find that angel-only deals have superior outcomes as
measured either by survival, or alternatively, by the likelihood of a successful liquidity event
(acquisition or IPO). This result is contrary to the conventional wisdom that VC financing
disproportionately enhances success probabilities (Timmons 1994), but consistent with evidence that VC backing does not improve survival rates (cf., Goldfarb, Kirsch, and Miller
2007). Moreover, this adverse selection may help explain why VCs tend to avoid smaller
investment deals and indicates a well-functioning angel capital market. Thus, our findings
suggest that public policy interventions in this private equity market may not necessarily
2

Freear et al. (2002), based on survey data, find that angels invest in firms close to their homes, but are
unable to compare angels to VCs.
3
Angels may also recognize that restrictive terms could create obstacles to VC funding in later rounds,
thus handicapping the long-term success of the venture (Ibrahim 2007; Wilmerding 2003).
4
Stricter control covenants imposed by VCs may be due to greater impatience stemming from pressures to
deliver returns to limited partners on an accelerated schedule (Jones and Rhodes-Kropf 2004; Sahlman 1990).
In addition, Inderst, Muller, and Munnich (2007) show that entrepreneurs have stronger incentives to exert
effort when investors are more constrained, since they must compete for limited funding in future rounds.
This can lead to an equilibrium in which high-quality managers would select shallow-pocket investors. It is
reasonable to assume that angels will likely be the most constrained funding source.

3

<-----Page 3----->be welfare enhancing (see also Lerner 1998).
If angels enjoy a preferential position in the entrepreneur’s pecking order, it is natural to
ask why they do not scale their investment strategy further and crowd out venture capital
financiers. Our findings that angels are more proximate to the firms they invest in, and
that angel-only financing is only observed for smaller transactions, suggests that angels
cannot scale their investment strategies because they face two important limitations: (1)
their informational advantage is primarily localized to a small number of proximate firms,
and (2) when deals are large, angels do not have sufficient assets to fully fund an investment
(at least without taking overly concentrated investment positions).
It follows that for larger transactions, entrepreneurs must seek at least some funding
from deeper-pocket VCs. Given the considerable complexity involved with negotiations that
include diverse sets of investors, and given the potential for agency problems that could
reduce investment viability in subsequent rounds, high quality entrepreneurs likely have a
preference to focus exclusively on VC financing for these larger deals. Furthermore, high
quality VCs will recognize good opportunities, and will try to capture them in entirety for
themselves and their syndicates. Hence, for larger transactions, angels might face adverse
selection and only receive allocations when the opportunity has less potential. These dynamics will result in less demand for weaker deals, which will require the broadest set of
investors including both VCs and angels. Consistent with these arguments, we find that
both companies in which either angels invest alone and companies in which VCs invest
alone, are more successful than deals in which VCs and angels co-invest. Moreover, angelonly deals are possible, and thus outperform, only when the transaction is small. VC-only
deals outperform most when deals are larger (i.e. when angel-only financing is not possible).
If VCs provide managerial expertise (Gompers and Lerner 2000, Ch 8, Hellman and
Puri 2002), this may also explain our findings regarding outcomes, and our finding that
VC-dominant deals have stricter control rights. In particular, when managerial expertise
is needed, VCs may only be willing to invest under strict terms. The relationship between
outcomes and strict VC-only investor composition might also arise because VCs may try to
prevent angels from free-riding on their costly managerial efforts.5
We further document the extent to which contractual terms may depend on historical
market conditions and industry. We find that terms became less entrepreneur-friendly after
the market decline that began in March 2000. We also find that biotechnology entrepreneurs
tend to retain greater board control.
In the next section, we describe our data sources, and present some descriptive statistics
characterizing the companies, deals, and investors covered in our sample. In Section III

Many angels are also valued advisors, see Wetzel (1983). However, the fact that they invest with
weaker control provisions suggests that they are less likely to implement more draconian measures such as
CEO-replacement.

Data Description

A

Preservation of the Brobeck Digital Corpus and Social Science

Our data are derived from the electronic records of the now defunct law firm Brobeck,
Phleger & Harrison (Brobeck). Brobeck had a rich history spanning more than seventyfive years of successful practice and the failure of the giant firm is a signature event in
the history of American legal practice (Kostal 2003; Murphy, Dillman, and Johnston 2005).
Founded in San Francisco in 1926, Brobeck served corporate clients in California and the
western United States. In 1980, the firm opened a satellite office in Palo Alto from which it
developed one of the largest law practices representing technology startups in Silicon Valley
and elsewhere. The Internet boom of the late 1990s led the firm to pursue a “Big Bet, Big
Debt” growth strategy that relied upon rapid growth to support increased infrastructure
costs. By 2000, the firm had nearly doubled the number of its attorneys in little more than
three years. Average annual partner compensation increased, surpassing $1 million in 2000.
However, as the technology economy slowed, Brobeck’s underlying costs could not be scaled
back to reflect shrinking revenue, and average income per partner fell to $611,000. A selfreinforcing cycle of defections and falling revenues pitched the firm into a “death spiral.” In
2002, the firm’s final full year of operation, Brobeck maintained multiple offices, had more
than 160 partners, and still employed hundreds of associates and staff. Annual revenues
remained strong at $320 million, but lease obligations and other fixed costs had soared as
a percentage of revenue. This drove average income per partner down to $245,000, which
in turn caused key partners and practice groups to leave for other law firms with less debt.
The firm decided to cease operations in February 2003. Seven months later, creditors forced
the liquidating firm to seek protection in bankruptcy court where 1,145 creditors alleged
liabilities of $258 million.6

Since the firm announced its intention to close, many articles in the legal and business press have looked
at the specific reasons for the failure. Kostal (2003) is the most readable account, but the perspective of the
bankruptcy trustee is also highly relevant (Murphy et al. 2005).

digital records of the failed firm. On August 9, 2006, Judge Dennis Montali of the United
States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, recognized the historic value of these materials and authorized the creation of a Closed Archive
allowing a significant fraction of these records to be saved. The Court Order specified that
the Brobeck Closed Archive will be established under the direction of the Library of Congress
and directed the Closed Archive to maintain the confidentiality of the digital records while
allowing social science research to proceed using an access model substantially similar to
that employed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.
The present work is the result of an experimental project designed to test the feasibility of
conducting social science under the proposed user model. According to the court-approved
methodology, access is restricted to archivists and scholars who have signed strict nondisclosure agreements. Access takes place in an on-site, non-networked, institutional setting,
and only for specific, enumerated purposes. Only aggregated or redacted data are allowed
to leave the secure area. It is hoped that this solution balances the need to safeguard legal
confidentiality while still supporting approved scholarly access.

Sample Description

With offices in the heart of Silicon Valley, Austin and the East Coast, Brobeck represented
both new ventures and investors. We focus on first round (Series A) investments. To
identify a research sample, an initial query was performed on a subset of the Brobeck digital
corpus. The subset consisted of approximately 3.7 million digital records which included
word processing documents, spreadsheets, and other electronic miscellany. We focused on
six categories of Brobeck representations (matters) that had usable documents concerning
relevant deals for the purposes of this study.7 Matters that lacked electronic documents were
dropped from the sample (most of these were prior to the coverage period of the electronic
database), as were those with few billable hours (where the deals did not close). Each
remaining matter was hand inspected to ascertain the contents of the representation. Our
query identified 182 Series A funding rounds with complete electronic records.
For each record, we observed three types of information: firm characteristics, investor
characteristics and deal characteristics. For each firm, we collected complete histories and
outcomes based on public sources including Lexis-Nexis, Hoovers, SEC-filings, and the Internet Archive (archive.org). In particular, we have a record of each firm’s internet presence
7

Each matter was categorized and also contained a short description of the nature of that particular
legal representation. The categories for whom there were some matters with the words “Series A” in their
descriptions were (with the matter counts shown in parenthesis): "Venture Finance/Company Side" (429),
"Venture Financing/Investor Side" (264), "Venture Fund Formation" (133), "Other Financing" (109), "General Business and Technology" (79), and "General Corporate Representation" (44).

6

<-----Page 6----->(from 1996) as well as a complete record of every press-release and article about the firm in
the popular press. This allows us to identify liquidations, bankruptcies, mergers, IPOs, and
major company milestones such as strategic alliances and product releases.
To assess the representativeness of our sample, we compared the characteristics of our
sample with first round financings of US-based firms recorded in the Thomson Financial
Venture Economics database and occurring between 1993 and 2002; which corresponds to
the years represented in our sample. We excluded buyout deals and all deals that Venture
Economics classified as “non-standard”. The characteristics of firms in the Brobeck sample are summarized in Table I, while corresponding statistics from Venture Economics are
described in the text. Our data over-samples recent rounds, has a locational bias that reflects Brobeck’s business activities, but is similar with respect to investment size and firm
industrial categories. 16% of the deals occurred before 1998, 34% between January 1998
and March 2000, and 49% from April 2000 through the end of 2002. This contrasts with
Venture Economics where 26% of deals occurred before 1998, 35% occurred between January
1998 and March 2000, and 38% occurred between April 2000 and December 2002. Thus, we
over-sample from the most recent period.
However, our sample does not differ by industrial classification. 61% of the sample
deals (111 of 182) appear in the VentureXpert database. We used the Venture Economic
Industrial Classifications (VEIC) to identify industries and classified the deals that were
absent from Venture Economics using information from the Brobeck corpus and the World
Wide Web. 80% of sample firms are classified as Information Technology firms, 11% are
classified as Medical/Health/Life Science, and the remainder are either non-high technology
or unclassified. In contrast, of the 15,620 US-based companies that reported receiving first
round financing from 1994 through 2002 reported in VentureXpert, 70% are classified as
Information Technology, 13% are classified as Medical/Health/Life Science, and 17% are
non-high technology. Our data are thus quite representative with respect to industry.
Reflecting the geographic footprint of Brobeck’s activities, our sample has a distinct locational bias. 53% of our observed investment targets are from California, 21% are from Texas,
7% are from Colorado, 8% are from the Northeast Corridor (Pennsylvania, New York and
New England), and the remaining 11% are scattered in the Midwest, South, Mid-Atlantic,
and Washington State. In contrast, 51% of first round venture deals as recorded by Venture
Economics during the same time period are equally distributed between the California and
the Northeast Corridor, only 2% of deals are in Colorado, and 7% of deals are in Texas.
Thus, we systematically over-sample deals from California, Colorado and Texas at the expense of other locations. Therefore, our sample is not geographically representative of the
United States. This bias may affect our results if there are systematic differences in control
rights between the East and West coasts. Gupta (2000) suggests that East Coast deals tend

7

<-----Page 7----->to have greater control rights, perhaps reflecting a stronger “entrepreneurial culture” on the
West Coast (Saxenian 1994). We control for location in our analysis to ensure that such
systematic differences are not linked with investor composition in such a way as to impact
our results.
The mean of the natural log of investment size is 14.98 in the Brobeck sample, which
is quite close to the mean log size of 14.73 in the Venture Economics sample.8 Our sample
reflects very early stage firms: the average age is 1.62 years, and most firms did not achieve
milestones prior to funding - only 13% had products and 10% had strategic alliances.9 Note
that Brobeck represented the company about twice as often (62 % of the time) as they did
the investor for the deals in our sample.
Our sample is unique in that it includes both angel-backed and VC-backed deals. In
the capitalization tables, we observe the names of each investor. We classified each investor
as a venture capitalist, a founder, or otherwise as an angel. Founders are identified using
a two stage process. First, founders are often explicitly identified in the records. When
founders are not explicitly identified, but common shareholders are, we identify founders
using the following three step rule: (1) the largest common shareholder is identified as a
founder and (2) any other shareholder holding at least 30% as many shares as the largest
common shareholder is also identified as a founder, and (3) any common shareholder holding
the position of president or CEO is also identified as a founder. Founders ubiquitously hold
common shares. Venture capitalists were identified by cross-referencing investor names with
investors appearing in the Venture Economics database, or if the names in our data included
the terms “venture", “L.P." or “L.L.P.".
There is considerable variation in the literature and in practice regarding the definition
of angel investors. We define angels as non-founder, non-VC investors. Because we define
VC-investors as those appearing in the Venture Economics database, we are thus careful to
classify both corporate VCs and traditional VCs as venture firms, and hence not as angel
investors.10 Because we cannot accurately identify family and friends, we include them in
our definition of angels, which is in contrast to some others such as Fenn and Liang (1998),
8

The statistics for the size of our deals are as follows: mean size is 6.1 million dollars (in Table I); median
size is 3.50 million; and the 25th and 75th percentile of size in our sample are 1.49 million, and 6.96 million,
respectively. In contrast in the Venture Economics universe, the mean deal size is 6.2 million dollars; the
median is 3.0 million, and the 25th and 75th percentiles as 1.0 million and 6.4 million respectively.
9
Given the relative lack of heterogeneity amongst our sample firms’ ages, we find that this age variable
lacks significant predictability with respect to outcomes and the other variables we study below.
10
There were a few occasions where investors had the word “venture” in their names but were not in Venture
Expert and were not venture capital organizations in the institutional sense we refer to here. In each such
case, their investment sizes were under $50,000 and the entities could not be found on the World Wide Web.
These small investment organizations are often set up for estate planning purposes, or to consolidate many
small investors into one legal entity for the purpose of a single investment. We classified these investors as
angels.

8

<-----Page 8----->who specifically exclude them from their definition of angels.11 In our sample, the mean
investment by an angel is $174,000, while the median investment size is $27,100, thus representing a highly skewed distribution which likely reflects the diverse set of investors captured
in our angel category. Although we cannot accurately identify friends and family, we note
that investors with the same name as founders are not uncommon, though they appear to
represent a relatively small proportion of the angels and the overall angel investment in our
sample. There are also a small number of specific investors whose categorization may be
subject to debate. For example, there are five angel investment groups in our sample, and
though angels are the main source of capital for these large groups, we put them into the
VC category given that their typical organizational structure closely resembles the delegated
monitoring mechanism under which VCs operate. Brobeck itself is an investor in some deals,
and we categorize them as an angel investor given that they are not in the delegated money
management business. While we believe our categorizations are reasonable, we perform
robustness checks described later in the analysis to ensure that our results are not driven
by how we categorize these special classes of investors, and find that our results are indeed
quite robust.
The literature suggests that angels are a diverse group. Wong (2002) formally defines
angels as those that are “accredited investors” according to SEC Regulation D, Rule 501.
Rule 501 states that accredited investors must have a net worth of over $1M or annual
income of over $200,000. Of these, some take on an active role while others invest passively.
Angels do have some commonalities in that the “typical” angel has a college degree and
active angels (those that provide business advice as well as capital) are often successful
entrepreneurs (Prowse 1998). Prowse also suggests that these active angels tend to focus on
early stage firms and, occasionally, invest alongside institutional investors. Unfortunately,
we do not observe investor demographics at this level in our data. However, we believe that
angels in our sample generally are “active”, as they obtain preferred stock and often invest
alongside VCs.
Venture capital firms invest in the majority of deals in our sample. To ascertain the
degree to which our sample is related to the broader sample of venture capital deals, we
compare the attributes of the venture capital firms that are represented in our sample to
those that are not along several dimensions. Data were collected from the Venture Economics
database. We then identified each private equity fund that invested in a company represented
in the Brobeck sample. As our paper advances a theory of VC-decision making, we aggregate
11

Extrapolating from the Survey of Small Business Finance, Fenn and Liang (1998) find that for every
one firm that raises a venture capital investment, six raise an angel investment. Similarly, they note that
approximately one-third of firms that go public were funded by venture capitalists, and two-thirds by angels
and conservatively conclude that there are at least double the amount of angel investments as compared to
venture capital investments.

9

<-----Page 9----->this fund-level information to the VC firm level. We refer to the private equity firm managing
each fund as a “Brobeck PE Firm”. We compare the size and location attributes of Brobeck
PE Firms and the rest of the private equity firm universe. We excluded firms whose last
investment occurred prior to 1993 (the first investment year in our sample) and firms whose
first investment occurred after December 31st 2002 (Brobeck ceased operations in February
2003). We report summary statistics in Table II.
Brobeck PE firms are older, have raised more venture funds, and have managed more
capital. They are more likely to manage US-based funds and, in particular, California-based
funds. Brobeck PE firms are more likely to manage early stage funds, but not seed stage
funds. They are more likely to manage VC funds and less likely to manage buyout funds.
Although their average investment round and average total company investment is larger
than average, their minimum round size is smaller than average.
To explore the robustness of these conclusions, we consider a multivariate analysis predicting whether a PE firm becomes affiliated with a Brobeck Series A deal in Table III, and
this analysis yields similar conclusions. In Model 1 we omit firm vintage controls, in Model
2 we include an age variable, and in Model 3 we include year-level dummies to control for
firm vintage. This multivariate analysis reveals several key facts. First, not surprisingly,
Brobeck PE firms are more likely to be US-based and conditional on being US-based, are
more likely to manage Northern California based funds. Second, they are more likely to
manage venture capital funds than buyout funds. Third, after controlling for the total number of funds, Brobeck PE firms have not managed a greater amount of aggregate capital,
and do not have larger average fund sizes (although this figure is less likely to be reported
for Brobeck PE firms). However, Brobeck PE firms tend to invest larger amounts of money
in individual companies, and at the same time, the minimum total company investment of
a Brobeck PE firm’s fund is smaller. We might expect this result given that participation
in a Series A investment round is a pre-condition for inclusion in the sample.12
Figure 1 and Table IV provide details of the investor composition of deals in our sample.
The top panel of Figure 1 depicts a histogram of the share of investors who are angels.
We observe a well-balanced mix in terms of investors - and it is this feature of our data
that allows us to explicitly compare angel and VC investments. As also reported in Table
IV, 18% of deals involve only business angels, 21% involve only venture capitalists, and the
remainder are mixed. However, the bottom panel of Figure 1 indicates that venture capitalists systematically invested more money. Across all deals, VCs purchased on average 67%
of Series A shares (reported in Table IV).13 After the close of the Series A round, founders
12

The final three models in the table demonstrate that these results are robust to i) selecting on firms that
never reported managing a buyout fund, ii) selecting on firms that reported managing at least one venture
capital fund, and iii) selecting on firms that reported managing at least one US-based fund.
13
All of the ownership percentages reported are based on shares issued in the seed and Series A round,

10

<-----Page 10----->retain 46% of the company on average, VCs hold 37%, and angels hold the remaining 17%,
some of which was purchased in the seed round (about 8% of seed round shares).14 Note
that only 15% of the angels in the Series A round previously invested in the seed round.
These features of the data suggest that sampling on Series A deals from a prominent
source, such as Brobeck, provides a unique opportunity to explore the influence of investor
composition on outcomes and deal characteristics. This allows us to focus on deals where
entrepreneurs have a meaningful choice between both investor types. Since the source of the
data is a law firm that represents both investors and companies, our sample does not favor
deals with a VC presence, as is the case when databases are constructed from VC firms as
in (Kaplan and Stromberg 2003).
We calculate Herfindahl indices to ascertain investor concentration. Consistent with the
premise that angels are capital constrained, VCs are more concentrated even though they
invest in larger deals (see Table IV). We only observe addresses for investors from 136 of
the sample firms. We find that investors were generally in the same geographic locales: 60%
were within 3 hours of driving time from target firms, and 18% were within the same zip
code. Brobeck itself invested in 24% of the deals.
With three exceptions, preferred stock was sold in all observed rounds. However, as
reported in Table V, warrants were sold in 15% of the rounds while employee option plans
were set up in 69% of the rounds. Interestingly, we observe multiple within-round closings
in 45% of the deals - a phenomenon referred to by Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) as “exante staging”. This practice, in which investors purchase more shares of the company at
identical terms over a period of time, takes place over an average of 165 days (average time
between first and second closings).15 Although this phenomenon is interesting, we can report
that the presence of multiple closings correlates little with investor composition and success
likelihood. However, multiple closings are related to higher legal fees.
Two additional characteristics of our data are unique to the literature. First, the Brobeck
corpus allows us to associate billed legal hours to deal characteristics. The mean deal in
our sample billed 169 hours (the median is 144 hours). This allows us to test, for example,
whether angel financing results in less expensive legal fees, all else equal. Second, and more
importantly, our data permit us to relate deal characteristics to venture outcomes. The
rather than fully diluted shares that take into account warrants and options outstanding. To ensure that
dilution does not have an impact on our regression results reported below, we account for the existence
of options and warrants, and for their dilutive effect (e.g., on the fraction of ownership sold in a Series A
round), and find that our results are robust to these controls.
14
We assume that founders retained all their stock in the seed round in the 16 cases where no explicit
founder data was identified. While the average fraction of Series A shares purchased by the founder appears
as zero in Table IV, it is in fact slightly positive (.0014), indicating that on rare occasions founders do put
in additional capital in order to purchase small amounts of Series A shares.

The maximum time between first and second closings reflects an outlier where $25,000 was invested

<-----Page 11----->majority of ventures in our sample have had successful outcomes as measured by survival
(60%). We can also report that 31% were acquired, and 8 firms sold stock in IPOs. This
allows us to evaluate which characteristics are associated with higher deal quality, as revealed
by ex-post outcomes.
In Table VI, we summarize the rights associated with the Series A preferred stock.
Gompers (1997) and Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) document that preferred stock is typically
differentiated from common stock through superior cashflow rights, voting rights, board
representation, liquidation rights, redemption rights, and anti-dilution provisions. Moreover,
investment deals are often supplemented by a requirement that the founder’s stock be subject
to vesting requirements. Consistent with these existing studies, we find substantial variation
in the existence and extent of these rights.16
As shown in Table VI, VCs and common shareholders each have roughly the same
representation (45%) on the boards of companies in our sample. This classification was done
using a two step procedure. First, in many cases, the documents identified which board seats
were to be designated by common shareholders or Series A shareholders. Second, for cases
in which seat ownership was not specified by share class, but individuals were, we used a
fuzzy name matching algorithm to link specific board members to specific investors. Because
our investors have already been classified as angels, VCs, and founders, this procedure also
identified which board seats were specifically occupied by VC affiliates as opposed to angel
affiliates.
Turning to cashflow rights, we find that preferred shareholders sometimes have stronger
residual cashflow claims in the form of cumulative dividend rights as opposed to regular
dividend rights. With regular dividends, an annual payment, often a percentage of investment (generally 8%), is paid conditional on a positive shareholder vote. With cumulative
dividend rights, this amount accumulates each year. Cumulative dividends are in general
seen as an investor-friendly term in a Series A financing.
The variable Liquidation is a dummy variable indicating whether preferred shareholders
have special liquidation cashflow rights going beyond their initial investment. A value of
zero indicates that, after preferred shareholders receive their initial investment, all remaining proceeds upon liquidation go to common shareholders. The dummy variable Cap on
Common, which takes a value of one for only two deals, indicates that common liquidation
amounts are capped. When the Liquidation dummy takes a value of one, preferred shareholders have cashflow rights beyond their initial investment, and in all cases but two, they
share these additional cashflows equally with common shareholders (in the two cases, all remaining proceeds go to preferred shareholders up to a specified cap). The mean liquidation
16
Practitioners classify these terms as investor friendly, entrepreneur friendly or neutral (Wilmerding
2003).

12

<-----Page 12----->dummy of 0.42 indicates that 42% of our sample deals provided strong liquidation rights to
Series A investors. The dummy variable Cap on Preferred ’s mean of 0.47 indicates that 47%
of these stricter deals also had an upper limit on the amount that can be paid to preferred
shareholders. Because many preferred liquidation rights are capped, it is important to note
that when the company value upon liquidation is sufficiently high, preferred stockholders
waive their liquidation rights, and convert their stock to common.
Finally, we find that preferred shareholders may have the right to redeem their shares
at will (in about one quarter of our deals), typically after a period of time and usually
conditional on a Series A majority or super-majority vote. Such a right would be invoked
when a firm is not performing well, and is considered to be an investor-friendly term.
Given that Kaplan and Stromberg (2003) (KS) examine cashflow and control rights for
a similar number of deals, but from a different source and an earlier time period, it is useful
to provide a quick comparison of the terms of our respective deals. Our samples differ
in many important respects. Our data represent 182 series A investments made by 346
distinct venture capital firms in 182 separate firms. In contrast, KS analyze 213 investments
(of which 98 are series A) in 119 portfolio firms made by 14 VC firms and their affiliates (KS
do not report the total number of distinct VCs who invested in the deals in their sample).
While they do not distinguish between pure-VC and mixed deals, KS find that non-VCs
own, on average, a 20% (non-diluted) stake in investment targets following series A rounds
versus the 17% in our sample. In general, the deals in our sample involve weaker control
right provisions.17 For example, we find that only 8.8% of deals involve cumulative dividend
rights, which is considerably below the frequency of 43.8% in KS. We also find that 23.6% of
our deals have redemption features, compared to 78.7% reported in KS. (Interestingly, KS
reported that 12.9% could redeem shares at fair market value, which is only slightly lower
than the 16.4% in our sample). Finally, we find that 85% of our deals include anti-dilution
provisions, with the weighted average method used in 92% of those cases, similar to the
95% of deals in KS that include anti-dilution protection, and the 78% of them that use the
weighted average method.18 The differences between our respective samples likely reflect
the stage of the deals we analyze, and the presence of angel-only deals in our sample.19
To better understand the differences between angel, VC, and other investors, we examine
descriptive statistics for subsets of our data identified by investor composition. In particular,
17

It is difficult to compare the success rates of two samples, as KS do not report outcomes as hazards
which would allow comparison of the likelihood of a given outcome.
18
We do not focus on anti-dilution provisions in our study given that there is little cross-sectional variation
across the deals.
19
Gompers (1997) notes certain characteristics of his sample of fifty VC private placement agreements
which appear consistent with our sample. For instance, 51.4% of board seats are controlled by venture
investors, which is slightly more than the 45.3% in our sample. However, redemption rights are found in
68% of the deals in Gompers’ sample, which is more in line with KS than with our sample, again likely
reflecting that their sample includes more later-stage rounds.

13

<-----Page 13----->we explore the differences between angel-only deals, VC-only deals, and mixed deals. We
report mean characteristics for each group in Table VII. These statistics are based on 33
angel-only deals, 38 VC-only deals, and 111 mixed deals, and are displayed in columns one
to three, respectively. VC-only deals are more than three times larger than angel-only deals,
and the median (not reported) VC deal is roughly twice the size of angel-only deals. Angelonly deals also have more investors, supporting the notion that angels are not as wealthy as
VC firms, and more angel investors are often needed to fully fund a given Series A round
relative to scenarios in which only VCs invest. Mixed deals, intuitively, have the largest
number of investors, but interestingly, are also larger in size.20 The relative size of deals in
the three investor composition categories can be seen most clearly in Figure 2. The figure
highlights that angel-only deals tend to be concentrated in a size range that is not densely
populated by VC-only deals, and vice-versa. In contrast, there are numerous mixed deals in
all segments of the size range.
Finally, Table VII also shows that angel-only deals are somewhat more likely to be in
the IT industry, and less likely to involve firms with strategic alliances. They also involve
fewer billable hours on average and include more founder-friendly control rights.

III

Investor Composition

We now use our information regarding firm, investor and deal characteristics, along with
location and investment patterns to better understand which characteristics are most likely
to result in angel-only financing, VC-only financing, and stronger overall VC participation
levels. We consider probit models to examine the likelihood of angel-only and VC-only
financing, and we use an OLS model to examine the fraction of investment dollars provided
by VC investors. Table VIII displays regression coefficients with t-statistics in parentheses.
We use standardized independent variables (except for dummy variables) throughout our
study, and we display marginal effects for all probit regressions. This gives our regression
coefficients a natural interpretation, as they indicate how much one standard deviation of
the given variable impacts the dependent variable. We find that smaller deals, and deals
involving the sale of a smaller fraction of the firm, are more likely to be funded by angels
alone. For example, a firm that is one standard deviation smaller is 9% more likely to be
angel-only financed, and 9% less likely to be VC-only financed. A firm with a larger fraction
being sold is 11% less likely to be angel only financed and is likely to have 11% more of
the deal financed by VCs. These findings are consistent with angels having relatively tight
budget constraints. In particular, these budget constraints imply that angel-only deals are
20

The median sizes of angel-only, VC-only and mixed deals (in millions of dollars) are 1.18, 3.53 and 4.55,
respectively.

14

<-----Page 14----->possible only when they are relatively small, and when a smaller fraction of a firm is being
sold. In contrast, VC-only financing is more common not only for larger deals, but also
for deals with fewer overall investors, consistent with the higher VC concentration in VConly deals. Our findings regarding the percent VC dollars (column 3) show that the same
characteristics that drive angel-only and VC-only financing (the end points of the percent
VC dollars variable) also affect the overall investor mix. When interpreting our later results,
it is important to keep in mind that, because we control for these characteristics throughout
this study, they cannot explain our broad findings. Finally, note that when Brobeck invests
in a deal, it generally does so alongside VCs.
Our hypothesis that angels are preferred investors leads us to ask whether they are also
more proximate (i.e. live closer) to the founder. For example, angel investors might include
friends, family, and business contacts, all of whom might live close to the founder. To answer
this question, we measure how far each investor lives from the firm’s corporate headquarters
(which proxies for the founder’s home), and we consider two dummy variables for each
investor: (1) does the investor live inside the corporate headquarter’s zip code, and (2)
does the investor live less than three hours away from the corporate headquarter’s zip code
(measured using Mapquest.com)? For each firm in our sample, we compute the average of
both dummy variables over the investors in each firm’s Series A financing. Table IX displays
regressions in which the dependent variable is either of these two investor distance measures.
The table shows that financings involving angel-only investors are 14% to 16% more likely
to be comprised of investors living in the same zip code as the firm’s corporate headquarters.
In contrast, VC investors are 19% to 23% less likely to live within a three hours drive from
the corporate headquarters. These findings support the conclusion that angels are more
proximate than VCs, and thus more likely have the opportunity to accept or reject an
investment before it is offered to VC investors. If these same angels are informed (being
proximate makes it more likely that they are), then angel-only deals will perform well in
relative terms, and deals being offered to VCs will suffer from an adverse selection problem.
In particular, VCs will tend to have the opportunity to provide financing only if angel
investors choose not to invest. Because angel investors suffer from tight budget constraints,
this dichotomy will exist primarily for smaller transactions. Our findings regarding outcomes
(reported later) support the conjecture that angel-only financings experience superior expost performance.
Table IX also shows that larger VC-only deals are especially likely to have investors
living outside the firm’s zip code, and deals with more investors are 11% to 13% more likely
to be funded by investors who more generally live further away. We also find that investors
are 11% more likely to live within a three hours drive when the investor base is highly
concentrated, 16% more likely to do so when Brobeck was hired by the company rather

15

<-----Page 15----->than by an investor, and around 27% to 30% more likely when the firm is headquartered in
California.

IV

Control Rights

We hypothesize that angels are preferred investors, and enjoy an earlier ranking in the
founder’s pecking order regarding sources of financing. To test this hypothesis further, we
examine whether angel investors accept more founder-friendly deal terms relative to VC
investors. To be thorough, we also explore the role of numerous control variables, and
whether terms have changed over time with market conditions during our sample period.
We begin this task by reviewing the securities purchase agreements of all the firms in our
sample. This initial analysis revealed that four key terms experience significant variation
across our sample: liquidation preferences, redemption rights, cumulative dividend rights,
and seats on the board of directors. Table X reports the results of probit models predicting
the likelihood of investor-friendly liquidation rights and redemption privileges. Table XI
reports the results of a probit model predicting the occurrence of cumulative dividend rights,
and an OLS model predicting the fraction of board seats allocated to common shareholders.
As before, all independent variables are standardized (except dummy variables), and we
report marginal effects for all probit models in order to give our reported coefficients simple
economic interpretations.
Table X and Table XI both illustrate that angel investors are associated with more
founder friendly deal terms. In particular, angel-only status implies a 38% lower likelihood
of having strong liquidation privileges for Series A investors, and a 20% reduced likelihood
of having redemption features. In contrast, a larger VC share of the Series A round is
associated with a higher likelihood of both liquidation and redemption rights. These results
are highly significant at the 1% or 5% level. Both liquidation rights and redemption rights,
when in place, grant valuable rights to Series A investors generally at the cost of common
shareholders including the founder. The negative relationship between angel investors and
Series A control rights is consistent with a founder preference for angels over VC investors.
Table X also shows that strict liquidation privileges became 29% to 35% more likely
following the collapse of the internet bubble (March 2000). This supports the notion that
start-up financing became more stringent as investors were less willing to invest in risky
firms following these events. Interestingly, deals in which Brobeck invested had stronger
liquidation rights, suggesting that they either encouraged terms that were more investorfriendly, or were more likely to invest when terms appeared to be more favorable to investors.
Redemption rights appear to be less frequent in deals involving Californian companies.
Table XI shows that investor composition is generally unrelated to whether or not cu-

16

<-----Page 16----->mulative dividends are specified in the securities purchase agreement. However, we find
that investors in firms that previously announced product releases (i.e., mature firms) are
roughly 16% more likely to seek cumulative dividend rights. This finding is consistent with
dividends only being relevant when firms generate positive cashflows, as the ultimate use of
the cash received from future sales is material only when sales actually exist.
We find some evidence, almost significant at the 10% level, that angel-only financings
cede 15% greater board control to common shareholders. The table also shows, intuitively,
that common shareholders receive greater board control (roughly 12% more per standard
deviation) when a smaller fraction of the firm is being sold. Biotechnology firms are associated with 23% to 27% more board control for common shareholders, perhaps due to the
more knowledge-intensive nature of this business.

V

Outcomes

Perhaps the most relevant test of any adverse selection hypothesis is a test of outcomes.
If angel investors are preferred investors, and they leave VC investors with “lemons”, then
angel-only transactions should experience superior outcomes. Similarly, if powerful VC
syndicates have first priority over larger deals, then large VC-only transactions should also
have superior outcomes. We employ two tests of outcomes in this section to evaluate this
hypothesis. We also explore more broadly whether other deal characteristics also affect
outcomes.
To test for outcomes, we first classify the 182 firms in our final sample into three groups:
(1) failed, (2) surviving but still independent and private, and (3) merger or IPO.21 This is
accomplished using hand searches based on Google, press releases from Lexis/Nexis and the
internet archive (www.archive.org). Our first test is based on a simple probit model, where
the dependent variable is zero for failed firms and one for all other surviving firms. Our
second test is an ordered probit model in which we allow the model to fit based on all three
outcome groups in the above specified order. Although we display marginal effects for the
simple probit model as before, we are unable to do so for the ordered probit model due to the
fact that this model has more than one outcome level. Hence, although significance levels
for the ordered probit model are relevant, the coefficients do not have a straightforward
interpretation.22
21

Since we are unable to accurately value companies that have been acquired or continue as private companies, we cannot ascertain investors’ returns. Thus, we focus on determining the success of the companies
in terms of survival and profitable exits, rather than measuring the magnitude of investment returns.
22
The interpretation of the ordered probit model is subtle as the effect of a change in an independent
variable can simultaneously affect the probability of failure and the probability of merger/ipo in opposite
directions. Hence, we simply report the ordered probit coefficients and later provide an intuitive graphical
view of their implied predicted values.

17

<-----Page 17----->Table XII displays the results of both specifications, and the first two columns display
the results of the basic survival probit regression. We find that angel-only financed deals
are 33% to 36% more likely to survive relative to other deals (at the 5% significance level),
consistent with the notion that angel investors are both informed and also preferred investors
and hence they can pick and choose which deals they actually invest in.
The results of the ordered probit are displayed in the second two columns of Table XII.
Figure 3 depicts the predicted probabilities of failure, merger / IPO, and ongoing survival
as a private firm as a function of investment size in the top, middle and bottom graphs,
respectively. Predictions are displayed for each of the three investor composition categories.
All variables are held at their means with the exception of the mutually exclusive investor
composition category dummies. Investment size is logged and normalized, and hence the
x-axis can be read as the number of standard deviations of the logged size of Series A
investment. The angel-only lines are censored at 0.5 standard deviations as this reflects the
largest angel-only deal in the sample. VC-only deals are much more likely to fail when they
are small, and to be successful when they are large (through a merger or IPO), and angelonly deals are most likely to succeed when they are small. Mixed deals perform worse than
either type. We should note that the predictions for VC-only deals that are one standard
deviation below the mean deal size are based on few observations (as illustrated in Figure
2), and should thus be interpreted with caution.
These results suggest that, among smaller transactions where angel investors likely have
sufficient proceeds to invest, transactions flowing to VC investors are more likely to be
“lemons”. This front-running by angels leads to an adverse selection problem for VCs in
smaller deals. In turn, this adverse selection might lead VC investors to demand greater
protection in the form of liquidation and redemption rights (consistent with our earlier
results). From the founder’s perspective, this further cements the status of VC investors as
being second to angels in the pecking order.
It is also possible that the results for angel-only financings are related to the managerial
expertise VC firms provide. In particular, it is well known that VC firms often participate in
managing the firm, serving on its board of directors, and in some cases, replacing the CEO
(Hellman and Puri 2002). The strict control rights we observe for VC backed transactions
(reported earlier) are necessary for VCs to accomplish this assistance as it is most necessary
when firms perform poorly. However, our results suggest that these controls are insufficient
to overcome the adverse-selection problem.
In total, our results suggest that both angel-only and VC-only transactions outperform
mixed deals where both investor types participate.23 The positive coefficient for the cross
23

We have conducted many robustness checks to ensure that our categorization of investors (e.g. for angel
investment groups, corporations, and Brobeck itself) does not affect our results. These tests confirm the
robustness of our results, not only with respect to the outcome regressions, but also with respect to our

18

<-----Page 18----->term (VC-only x log size) (significant only in the ordered probit regression) indicates that
the success of deals that are VC-only is most prevalent for larger transactions.24
The success of VC-only transactions could be explained by numerous hypotheses. A
popular explanation for the superior performance of VC backed IPOs is the certification
hypothesis (Megginson and Weiss 1991). As all our deals are from a prominent law firm
(Brobeck), our sample likely includes only higher quality deals. Hence, our sample contains a
natural control for certification, making it less likely that the certification hypothesis explains
our results. The certification hypothesis also cannot explain why a cross term multiplying
VC-only status and firm size is positive and significant, as the value of certification should
be larger for smaller transactions where information asymmetry is likely to be largest.
A second explanation of our VC-only result is that for some deals, especially larger deals,
skilled entrepreneurs must seek VC financing due to the large amount of capital needed.
In such cases, both the VCs and the entrepreneurs may desire to exclude angels as they
complicate negotiations, particularly when angel participation in the Series A round could
make subsequent financing rounds more difficult.25 Also, VCs may want to prevent angels
from free-riding on their costly managerial efforts.
Finally, the superior performance of large VC-only backed transactions may be rooted
in the strong market power of VC syndicates. Hence, in large transactions, angel investors
face adverse selection and only receive allocations when the deal is less favorable. This
explanation is especially consistent with the superior performance of large VC-only backed
transactions, and suggests that VC investors effectively squeeze angels out of a transaction
when the deal is a highly favorable one, and when they have sufficient market power to do
so.
Table XII also shows that larger deals are 15% to 18% more likely to survive, and
mature deals (as measured by the existence of a product that can actually be sold) are
27% more likely to survive. We also find that firms engaging in strategic alliances are 36%
less likely to survive, firms with a higher degree of investor concentration are roughly 11%
other regressions reported in other sections.
24
A similar cross term for angel-only financings is not significant.
25
We examined the impact of using cutoffs other than 100% when categorizing deals as angel-only or VConly to see whether our results depend on the strict purity investor identification. Since the lowest VC share
in the mixed deal group is 26.3%, there are no “near angel-only deals”. In contrast, there are a number of
mixed deals that have relatively minor angel participation (“near VC-only deals”); for instance, there are 62
deals that have at least 95% VC share Series A participation, which is dramatically larger than the 38 that
are pure VC-only deals. Hence, there is some clustering near the VC-only extreme. In examining robustness
to these less stringent definitions of “VC-only”, we find that the VC-Only x size term loses significance in
the outcome regressions, suggesting that defining VC-Only in a pure fashion does matter (it also has some
minor effects on the control rights and proximity regressions). (In contrast, adding a quadratic term for
VC share into the regression does not similarly impact the regression results, so the angel participation
effect is truly discontinuous, and not simply due to non-linearities). We conclude that for larger deals, even
minor angel participation might unnecessarily complicate a deal, and this practice would thus be eschewed
by high-quality managers and VCs.

19

<-----Page 19----->less likely to survive and firms with a larger fraction being sold are less likely to succeed
in the ordered probit model. California companies were also 20% more likely to succeed.26
The concentration result might be due to firm maturity, as firms with more concentrated
ownership are likely to be earlier in their development and thus more likely to fail due to the
higher risks facing earlier startups. This variable might also proxy for deal syndication, as
larger syndicates will generate less investor concentration. Here, syndication might generate
superior outcomes because of the improved informational environment associated with the
syndicate’s collective signal.
Although we do not have data regarding the terms of Series B financings, using a combination of Venture Economics, press releases, and the Brobeck archives, we can report that
100 of the 182 firms in our sample have experienced a VC-backed Series B round by mid 2007
and that most of these were identified using Venture Economics. We can also report that
the incidence of Series B financing is not significantly related to our key Series A variables.
The only variable that reliably predicts Series B financing is the percent of the firm sold
in the Series A round. Firms selling more are more likely to experience a Series B round,
consistent with percent sold possibly proxying for capital intensive businesses.27

VI

Billable Hours

In this section, we explore the determinants of how many hours are billed by the attorneys
preparing the documents for each transaction. Our main hypothesis is that angel-only financings will be associated with fewer billed hours. In particular, we noted earlier that angel
investors are associated with more founder friendly liquidation and redemption provisions.
Our expanded hypothesis is that the founder friendly stance of angel investors will also generate fewer billable hours due to contract simplicity and the likelihood that angel investors
will raise fewer legal issues than institution-minded venture capital investors.
Table XIII displays results of regressions where the natural logarithm of total hours billed
(specifically due to the Series A financing) is the dependent variable. The table shows that
angel-only transactions indeed generate fewer billable hours. This result is significant at the
5% level and supports the conclusion that angels operate in a fashion that is more founder
friendly.
26

Although not shown in the table, we also examine whether the following variables affect outcome:
Brobeck corporate representation, %VC Share in Series A (a measure of heterogeneity amongst the mixed
deals), Warrants and Option Pool dummies, control rights variables (Liquidation, Redemption, Cumulative
dividends), Nasdaq returns over the last month (rather than year), and IPO volume over the last year (rather
than three years). None of these variables have a significant impact on outcomes.
27
The analysis of Series B rounds likely suffers from an important selection problem. Because our primary
source of Series B incidence is the Venture Economics database, we should not expect to observe angel-only
Series B deals since they are unlikely to be reported in this database.

20

<-----Page 20----->The table also documents that size, the number of closings, and the existence of warrants
are positively correlated with the number of billable hours. These variables likely proxy for
deal complexity, as more complex transactions likely require additional legal protection.
While not reported, the relationship between angel-only and billable hours is robust to the
inclusion of the control rights measures Liquidation, Redemption, Cumulative and Common
or VC Board seats. Our interpretation is that angel-only deals require fewer billable hours
because they are less contentious, and not because these deals are simpler from a legal
drafting perspective.
The table also shows that billable hours are negatively correlated with the fraction of
the firm being sold. This result might be driven by firm maturity, as firms selling a larger
fraction might be younger firms, which in turn require less legal expertise due to their simpler
corporate structures. Alternatively, naive entrepreneurs may simultaneously sell large shares
of their firm and not negotiate hard on terms. Finally, note that billable hours increase in
the later periods of the sample, and are significantly higher for Californian start-ups.

VII

Conclusion

This experimental project stemming from the proposed Brobeck archive provides a unique
opportunity to better understand the role of angels in financing startups. Two unique features of our sample allow us to explore differences between VCs and angels on the margin in
an environment where both are competitive financing choices. First, our sample’s investor
mix has a wide distribution ranging from angel-only deals to VC-only deals. Second, entrepreneurs in these deals have a meaningful choice between both investor types. This allows
us to identify the relationship between investor composition, deal terms, and outcomes.
We find evidence consistent with a pecking order whereby, for smaller deals, angels are
preferred investors who are able to select the highest quality deals. Entrepreneurs prefer
dealing with angels given the less stringent terms imposed on them through liquidation,
redemption and other control rights. Our results further suggest that angels accept more
entrepreneur-friendly terms in part because they are better informed about the nature of
these deals. In contrast, for larger deals, where VC participation is required due to the large
amount of capital needed, powerful VC syndicates demand the best opportunities in their
entirety.
Consistent with these notions, we find that among smaller transactions, angel-only deals
are most successful. This supports the notion that within the set of deals that could potentially be financed only by angels (who are capital constrained), VCs face adverse selection
and only receive investment opportunities when they are less favorable. When deals are
larger, and cannot be easily financed only by angels, our results suggest that more suc-

21

<-----Page 21----->cessful entrepreneurs seek pure-VC financing. Hence, angel investors might face adverse
selection when investing alongside VC syndicates in larger deals. This latter result might
also arise because either mixed angel-VC deals involve greater complexity, or because VCs
seek to preclude angels from free-riding on their potentially costly managerial efforts.
Lerner (1998) has raised the important issue of whether angel investment in early-stage
companies should be encouraged through public policy interventions. This debate presumably stems from a complaint that entrepreneurs have difficulty raising capital. Our results
suggest that there is a well-functioning market in which angels reject lower quality opportunities. Thus, it is not clear that turning "latent" angels into active angels would have clear
societal benefits. However, there is no question that additional research will help to further
inform this debate.

<-----Page 27----->Figure 3: Effect of deal size on predicted outcome probabilities by investor composition
The figure depicts the predicted probabilities of failure, merger / IPO, and ongoing survival as a private firm, for
investment targets as a function of investment size in the top, middle and bottom graphs respectively. Predictions
are displayed for each of the three investor composition categories: deals in which angels and VCs invested
side-by-side (“mixed”), deals which included only VCs (“VC only”) and deals which included only angels (“angel
only”). Predictions are based on the final ordered probit model in Table XII. All variables are held at their means
with the exception of the mutually exclusive investor composition category dummies. Investment size is logged and
normalized and hence the x-axis can be read as standard deviations of the natural logs of Series A investment size.
The angel-only lines are censored at 0.5 standard deviations as this reflects the largest angel-only deal in the sample.
The predictions for VC-only deals one standard deviation below the mean deal size are based on few observations
and should be interpreted with caution.

<-----Page 28----->Table I: Summary Statistics for Firms in Sample
The table summarizes characteristics of sample firms. Period dummies reflect date of first closing. Firm industry
classifications are based upon Thomson Financial Venture Economic’s proprietary industrial codes (VEIC). IT Firm
indicates an information technology firm. Medical/Bio–Tech Firm indicates firms classified as “Medical/Health/Life
Sciences”. For deals that did not appear in Venture Economics, classifications were determined according to Brobeck
records and public archival sources. State dummies are based on location of headquarters. Size (and its natural log
Log Size) are measured based on investment dollars. Firm Age is the number of years between the firm’s founding
date and the date its Series A preferred stock issue closes (computed as number of days divided by 365.25).
Company matter takes the value of 1 if Brobeck did not label the representation “Venture Financing/Investor Side”.
Strategic Alliance and Product Release indicate whether the firm issued a press release describing an alliance or
product prior to the observed round.

The table displays summary statistics with t-statistics in parenthesis. The sample includes all private equity firms who made investments between 1/1/1993 and
12/31/2002 that are included in the Thomson Financial Venture Economics database. The statistics include the histories of these private equity firms, including
funds that were managed outside the 1993-2002 time frame. Statistics are reported by whether the firm was represented in the Brobeck Sample. All fund statistics
are aggregated at the VC firm level. # funds under firm management is the number of funds ever managed under the private equity firm’s management. Ln(total
capital raised) is the natural log of the total capital (in millions of US dollars) raised by these funds. Ln(fund size, $M ) is the mean capital raised for each fund
under a private equity firm’s management. First investment year is the first year that firm invested. Share of funds hq in northern CA and Share of funds hq in US
represent the share of funds under the private equity firm’s management that report headquarters in northern California and the United States respectively. Share of
VC funds and Firm’s share of buyout funds represent the share of funds under the VC firm’s management reporting that they are venture capital or buyout funds.
Share of funds with Seed Stage Focus and Share of funds with Early Stage Focus represent the share of funds under the firm’s management that report a focus on
seed stage deals or early stage deals. Share of funds not reporting round company investment levels is the share of the firm’s funds for which company investment
data are missing. Ln(average company investment by fund, $M ) is the natural log of the fund’s mean total company investment in millions of USD, averaged over all
funds under a given firm’s management. Share of funds not reporting minimum investment is the firm’s share of funds for whom minimum investment data is
missing. Ln(minimum round investment by fund, $M ) is the natural log of the minimum round investment, averaged over funds under a firm’s management.
Ln(minimum company investment by fund, $M ) is the natural log of the minimum company investment, averaged over funds under a firm’s management. Age is
measured relative to 2002. Final column reports the results of t-tests of the difference in means with unequal variance.

The table displays Logit model marginal effects with t-statistics in parenthesis. All independent variables (except dummy variables) are standardized to clarify
exposition. The sample includes all private equity firms who made investments between 1/1/1993 and 12/31/2002 that are included in the Thomson Financial
Venture Economics database. The statistics includes the histories of these private equity firms, including funds that were managed outside the 1993-2002 time frame.
The dependent variable in all specifications is a dummy variable taking the value one if the given private equity firm is in the Brobeck sample. The analysis is run on
four samples. The first three models include the entire sample and explore robustness to vintage controls. The last three models, respectively, exclude firms that ever
managed a buyout fund, include firms that ever managed a VC fund and include only firms that ever managed a US-based fund. All fund statistics are aggregated at
the VC firm level. # funds under firm management is the number of funds ever managed under the private equity firm’s management. Ln(total capital raised) is the
natural log of the total capital (in millions of US dollars) raised by these funds. Ln(fund size, $M ) is the mean capital raised for each fund under a private equity
firm’s management. First investment year is the first year that firm invested. Share of funds hq in northern CA and Share of funds hq in US represent the share of
funds under the private equity firm’s management that report headquarters in northern California and the United States respectively. Firm’s share of VC funds and
Share of buyout funds represent the share of funds under the VC firm’s management reporting that they are venture capital or buyout funds. Share of funds with
Seed Stage Focus and Share of funds with Early Stage Focus represent the share of funds under the firm’s management that report a focus on seed stage deals or
early stage deals. Share of funds not reporting round company investment levels is the share of the firm’s funds for which company investment data are missing.
Ln(average company investment by fund, $M ) is the natural log of the fund’s mean total company investment in millions of USD, averaged over all funds under a
given firm’s management. Share of funds not reporting minimum investment is the firm’s share of funds for whom minimum investment data is missing. Ln(minimum
round investment by fund, $M ) is the natural log of the minimum round investment, averaged over funds under a firm’s management. Ln(minimum company
investment by fund, $M ) is the natural log of the minimum company investment, averaged over funds under a firm’s management. Age is measured relative to 2002.

Table III: Characteristics of Brobeck VC Firms: Robustness

<-----Page 31----->Table IV: Summary Statistics for Investors
The table summarizes descriptive statistics of investor composition and investor deal-share variables. Seed Founder
Ownership and Seed Angel Ownership break down the two components of initial ownership in the company.
Founder Series A, Angel Series A and VC Series A break down ownership within the Series A round. Final Angel
Ownership, Final Founder Ownership, and Final VC Ownership represent the respective ownership shares
post-money (before any subsequent dilution from options). All other composition variables reflect ownership shares,
as opposed to Fraction Sold, which shows the percentage of the company sold to investors in the Series A round.
Angel Only (VC only) are dummy variables equal to one if all investors in the deal are angels (VC firms). Repeat
Angel Flag takes the value of 1 if an angel who invested prior to the Series A also invested in the Series A round. #
Investors is a count of investors in the deal. Repeat investments by the same investor (generally across rounds) are
counted as a single investor (Log # Investors is the natural log.) VC HHI and Investor HHI are the Herfindahl
indices of VC share concentration and overall investor share concentration, in the Series A round, respectively. The
Brobeck Investor Dummy is one if Brobeck invested in the given firm (either common or preferred shares). %
Investors Within 3 Hours is the share of investors (unweighted by dollars invested) who are within three hours
driving distance. Distance is measured from zip-code center to zip-code center using an automated Mapquest query.
% Investors in Same Zip Code is the share of investors (unweighted by dollars invested) in the same zip code.

<-----Page 32----->Table V: Summary Statistics for Deals and Outcomes
The table summarizes deal and outcome characteristics. Warrants Dummy takes the value 1 if warrants were issued
in the Series A Financing. and Options Dummy takes the value 1 if an option plan was set up concurrent with the
Series A Financing. # closings is the number of separate executed closings under the Series A terms. Multiple
Closings is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if there was more than one closing. Average Days to Second
Closing is the time in days between the first and second closings, conditional on it occurring. All preceding variables
are taken from the electronic record of the closing documents in the Brobeck corpus. Billed Hours and its natural
log Log billed Hours reflect the total billed hours associated with Brobeck’s representation of either the company or
its investors in the deal, and is extracted from Brobeck’s billing database. Outcome Based on Survival is a dummy
variable that takes the value of 1 if the firm was conducting business as either an independent entity or as part of a
larger firm in July 2007. Survival was ascertained by cross-referencing current World Wide Web presence with
company histories as determined through archival sources. Outcome Merger or IPO is a dummy variable that takes
the value of 1 if a liquidity event occurred either as a merger or as an IPO. Mergers were determined using archival
sources, primarily based upon press releases. 9 firms in our sample had IPOs.

<-----Page 33----->Table VI: Summary Statistics for Cashflow and Control Rights
The table summarizes the control rights associated with Series A financings. Control rights and terms are extracted
from closing documents from the Brobeck Corpus. VC BOD seats and Common BOD Seats are the share of board
seats held by VCs and common share holders respectively. Seat ownership is either directly stated in closing
documents (generally the “voting rights agreement”), or when specific parties are named, by cross-referencing these
names with the classified investors. Cumulative Dividend Flag is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if
preferred shareholders have a right to dividends that accumulate over the time of their investment. Liquidation is a
dummy variable that takes the value 1 when preferred shareholders have liquidation rights exceeding the value of
their initial investment. Cap on Preferred is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if preferred stock liquidation
rights are capped at a multiple of the initial investment. Cap on Common is a dummy variable that takes the value
1 if common stock liquidation rights are capped at a multiple of the investment. Redeemable Flag is a dummy
variable that takes the value 1 when when preferred shareholders can demand that the firm repurchase their shares.
Time to 1st Redemption is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if preferred stockholders’ redemption rights are
time-delayed. % Series A Req. to Vote is the percentage of Series A shareholders required to invoke a redemption.

The table displays Probit model marginal effects and OLS model coefficients with t-statistics in parenthesis. All independent variables (except dummy variables) are
standardized to clarify exposition. The dependent variable in the three models (one model per column) is an angel-only dummy, a VC-only dummy, and the
percentage of dollars funded by VC investors (% VC dollars), respectively. The angel-only dummy is one if none of the Series A stock investors are identified as
venture capital firms. The VC-only dummy is one if all of the Series A stock investors are identified as VC firms. The % VC dollars is equal to the total dollar
investments in Series A stock made by VC firms divided by the total dollars invested in Series A stock by all investors. The independent variables include other
investor characteristics, firm characteristics, industry dummies, and time dummies, and are described in Tables I to VI.

The table displays OLS model coefficients with t-statistics in parenthesis. All independent variables (except dummy variables) are standardized to clarify exposition.
The dependent variable in the first two models (displayed in the first two columns) is the percentage of Series A stock investors who live in the same zip code as the
corporate headquarters. The dependent variable in the second two models (displayed in the last two columns) is the percentage of Series A stock investors who live
within a three mile drive of the corporate headquarters (identified using mapquest.com). The independent variables include an angel-only dummy, a VC-only dummy,
and cross term multiplying the VC-only dummy by Log Size (the logarithm of the total dollar proceeds raised by Series A stock investors). The angel-only dummy is
one if none of the Series A stock investors are identified as venture capital firms. The VC-only dummy is one if all of the Series A stock investors are identified as VC
firms. The other independent variables include additional investor and firm characteristics, and industry and time dummies, and are described in Tables I to VI.

The table displays Probit model marginal effects with t-statistics in parenthesis. All independent variables (except dummy variables) are standardized to clarify
exposition. The dependent variable in the first two models (displayed in the first two columns) is a dummy variable indicating whether the liquidation preference of
the Series A stock favors the Series A investors relative to common stockholders. In the event of a liquidation, a value of one indicates that all proceeds go to Series
A shareholders up to a multiple of the initial Series A investment. A value of zero indicates that Series A liquidation privileges are limited to the initial investment.
The dependent variable in the second two models (displayed in the last two columns) is a dummy variable identifying whether the Series A shares are redeemable (ie
they can be returned to the firm in exchange for cash). The independent variables include an angel-only dummy, a VC-only dummy, a cross term multiplying the
VC-only dummy by Log Size (the logarithm of the total dollar proceeds raised by Series A stock investors), and % VC dollars. The angel-only dummy is one if none
of the Series A stock investors are identified as venture capital firms. The VC-only dummy is one if all of the Series A stock investors are identified as VC firms. %
VC dollars is equal to the total dollar investments in Series A stock made by VC firms divided by the total dollars invested in Series A stock by all investors. The
additional independent variables include additional investor characteristics, firm characteristics, industry dummies, and time dummies, and are described in Tables I
to VI.

The table displays Probit model marginal effects and ordered Probit model coefficients with t-statistics in parenthesis. All independent variables (except dummy
variables) are standardized to clarify exposition. The dependent variable in the first two models (displayed in the first two columns) is a dummy variable indicating
whether the firm is still a going concern as of July 2007. More specifically, firms that went public, firms that were acquired, and firms that have a visible web
presence are all assigned a value of one. The dependent variable in the second two models (displayed in the last two columns) is an ordered variable taking three
possible values: 3 if IPO or acquisition, 2 if firm is a going concern but did not experience an IPO or an acquisition, and 1 for other firms (assumed to be failed
firms). The independent variables include an angel-only dummy, a VC-only dummy, and cross term multiplying the VC-only dummy by Log Size (the logarithm of
the total dollar proceeds raised by Series A stock investors). The angel-only dummy is one if none of the Series A stock investors are identified as venture capital
firms. The VC-only dummy is one if all of the Series A stock investors are identified as VC firms. The additional independent variables include other investor
characteristics, firm characteristics, industry dummies, and time dummies, and are described in Tables I to VI.

Log Billed Hours

The table displays OLS model coefficients with t-statistics in parenthesis. All independent variables (except dummy variables) are standardized to clarify exposition.
The dependent variable in all specifications is the natural logarithm of the total number of hours billed by Brobeck specifically regarding the Series A financing. The
independent variables include an angel-only dummy, a VC-only dummy, and cross term multiplying the VC-only dummy by Log Size (the logarithm of the total
dollar proceeds raised by Series A stock investors). The angel-only dummy is one if none of the Series A stock investors are identified as venture capital firms. The
VC-only dummy is one if all of the Series A stock investors are identified as VC firms. The additional independent variables include other investor characteristics,
firm characteristics, industry dummies, and time dummies, and are described in Tables I to VI.
