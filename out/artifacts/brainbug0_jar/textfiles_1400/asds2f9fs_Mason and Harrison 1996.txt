industry in both the US and Europe has
encountered difficulties in raising new
funds in recent years, creating the real
possibility of a significant decline in the
value of annual investments (Murray,
1994). This has been exacerbated by a
shift in the investment focus of the
venture capital industry away from startups and early stage businesses in favour

useful products or will bring economic
benefits to their community. Some
investors are motivated, in part, by a
feeling that, having been successful in
business themselves they have an
obligation to give something back to the
system that allowed them to prosper by
assisting the next generation of
entrepreneurs (Wetzel, 1991; Baty, 1991).
A number of studies have noted that a
significant proportion of private investors
are willing to trade-off some financial
returns for various non-financial benefits
(Wetzel, 1981; Tymes and Krasner, 1983;
Sullivan and Miller, 1990).
Studies which have examined the
investment criteria that business angels
take into account when evaluating an
investment opportunity are remarkably
consistent in finding that the quality of
the entrepreneur/management team is
paramount, underpinned by the market
potential of the product or service (Haar
et al, 1988; KPMG, 1992; Mason and
Harrison, 1994). In this respect, business
angels are acting similarly to professional
venture capitalists who, in the evaluation
of new ventures, also regard the quality of
the management team as the key
determinant in the funding decision
(MacMillan et al, 1985). However, the
emphasis which business angels give to
various investment criteria changes as the
process moves from first impressions,
through initial investigation, due diligence
and negotiations, with the majority of
opportunities rejected before the investor
ever meets the entrepreneur. In the only
study of its kind, Riding et al (1993) note
that the potential of the product and
industry is the key consideration initially,
but that the importance of the
management team increases during the
course of the decision-making process and
becomes paramount as the deal

approaches
the
possibility
of
consummation. The realism of the
business projections also assumes greater
significance at the due diligence stage.
These investment criteria are reflected
in the reasons why business angels reject
investment proposals. Here again there is
considerable unanimity between studies.
The most common 'deal killers' are, first,
the investor's lack of confidence in the
abilities of the entrepreneur I
management team to succeed, and
second, insufficient market potential for
the product or service (Haar et al, 1988;
Gaston, 1989; Riding et al, 1993; Mason
and Harrison, 1994). These reasons also
parallel those given by professional
venture capitalists for rejecting investment
proposals (Bruno and Tyebjee, 1983).
A significant limitation of our existing
knowledge concerning the reasons why
informal investors reject investment
opportunities is that previous research
has focussed on the investor rather than
the deal; in other words, the factors
which have been identified as 'deal
killers' have been based on generalised
rather than deal specific information. As
a result, it is not possible to differentiate
between criteria at different stages of the
evaluation process. Neither is it possible
to identify whether there are noncompensatory, or essential, criteria. We
are also unable to say whether there is
any consistency in deal rejection factors,
for example, between types of venture,
industry sector and entrepreneur, nor to
explore the existence of deal features
associated with a high probability of
rejection. The clear implication,
therefore, is that research needs to shift
from the investor's perception of his
activities to his perception of the deals
which actually cross his desk. Moreover, it
is only with such deal specific

information
that sensible
and
appropriate advice can be offered to
entrepreneurs seeking to raise finance
from the informal venture capital market.
In this paper we take a small step in
this direction by examining a random
sample of deals that were considered and
subsequently rejected by Metrogroup, a
private investor syndicate in the UK The
information was gathered by means of a
series of taped interviews with the
syndicate's instigator, or 'archangel', who
discussed 35 investment opportunities
that the syndicate had rejected. These
investment opportun1t1es were
considered during the period 1986-1988;
the fieldwork reported on in this paper
was collected in late 1989 and early 1990.
The information on the activities of
this informal investment syndicate of
potential interest in the context of this
study falls into four categories: first,
descriptive materials (e.g. brochures,
promotional materials) on the proposals;
second, the original business plan for
each proposal, indicating detailed
information on the opportunity, the
product and market, the team and the
financial structure and prospects; third,
the evaluation reports prepared by the
syndicate (see below); and fourth, copies
of notes, memos and minutes of
syndicate discussions of the proposals.
Given that this initial study was designed
to examine the reasons for the rejection
of investment proposals, rather than
study and objectively analyse the business
plans themselves (as formal business
plans only represent part of the
information and assessment process
undertaken by informal investors in an
appraisal process), we have concentrated
on the analysis of the third and fourth
categories of information. In the absence
of fully comprehensive data held on file

in these two categories, detailed face-tofac e interviews with the 'archangel'
represents the only realistic method of
addressing the issue of why angels say no.
The 35 files that are investigated in this
study were chosen on the basis of
information availability, which in turn
reflected the extent to which the
syndicate had pursued its interest in the
investment opportunity. Thus, the
interviews did draw extensively on the file
information, including business plan
information, where necessary to support
and elaborate on the archangel's
op1mons and explanations. The
consequence of selecting the cases on the
basis of information availability is that
there is a slight bias in our sample
towards proposals which were formally
investigated by the syndicate as a whole
(31 per cent, compared with 20 per cent
for the population of proposals received).
This case study approach to examine
investment decision-making has also been
used in studies of the formal venture
capital industry (e.g. Roberts, 1991).
Although we only have the views of one
member of the syndicate, albeit the
'archangel', this is less of a concern than
might appear: anecdotal evidence
indicates that informal investor syndicates
are often structured around a key
individual who undertakes the evaluation
on behalf of the group and whose
recommendation has a significant
influence on other syndicate members
(e.g. Spragins, 1991). As the evidence
presented below indicates, the 'archangel'
in this case did undertake the initial
screening and due diligence investigations
himself, filtering out up to 80 per cent of
the proposals received by the syndicate
before the other syndicate members were
asked to become formally involved in the
evaluation process.

Metrogroup: A Syndicate of Business
Angels2
Metrogroup was established by Andrew
Blair who had retired in his mid-fifties
from a very active and varied business
career in media communications. During
a visit to Florida, he had a fortuitous
encounter with an American attorney
actively involved in private venture capital
networks. He was fascinated with the
concept and on his return to the UK he
decided to form a syndicate of business
angels. His method of seeking out other
like-minded individuals was to advertise
in the Financial Times 'Business
Opportunities' column on the grounds
that its readership seemed most
appropriate for this purpose. This
produced in the order of 60 replies.
Through a series of one-to-one and
group meetings with those who
responded he eventually selected 11
individuals (one of whom subsequently
dropped out) to join the syndicate on the
basis of the following key factors:
• compatibility of personality;
• experience of the small ITusiness world;
• a commitment to the private investor
syndication concept;
• adequate time available for the
venture;
• negative over-riding motives: full-time
job, networking for consultancy
assignments, social meetings.
The members - all men - included
two property developers, three chartered
accountants and four successful
businessmen who had sold their concerns
and were now looking for new business
interests. All were 'virgin' angels (Freear
and Wetzel, 1992). The syndicate was
called Metrogroup to reflect the
Metropolitan London nature of the
grouping.
The syndicate was incorporated as a

limited company and each member
invested in its ordinary share capital.
There was no lower level for this
investment but an upper limit was set in
order not to create an imbalance in
favour of any single dominant
shareholder. A total of£120,000 of money
was raised from the founder shareholders
and a business plan was prepared which
set out the overall strategy to be adopted
by Metrogroup in utilising shareholders'
funds. These funds were essentially to be
allocated for working capital, aimed at
potential deals, plus the funding of
overheads - chiefly premises and
administrative/secretarial staff. A
stockbroker friend of Blair's offered the
syndicate a very elegant self-contained
office suite and a part-time secretary at
cost. The syndicate members nominated
and elected a board of directors and
chairman. A detailed set of rules was also
devised and accepted by all members.
Having established the operational
ground rules the syndicate began to look
for potential deals. There was a general
consensus by the syndicate not to
concentrate on any particular industry
sector. One of the syndicate's documents
stated the investment philosophy as
follows: "Metrogroup will seek to provide
investment opportunities in companies
that demonstrate high growth potential. It
will be primarily interested in sound
business propositions which are market
led rather than technology driven". The
size of any investment, the equity/loan
structure and the majority/minority
control issue were to be decided on a case
by case basis. Similarly, although
"Metrogroup's approach will be to actively
assist the businesses in which the
investment is made", the nature of any
hands-on participation in the investee
company would be left for the selection

<-----Page 6----->40 I International Small Business Journal 14, 2

committee to decide at a later date. All in
all, the syndicate's investment philosophy
was fairly liberal with few, if any,
restrictions.
The syndicate's sources of deal flow
were as follows:
• business opportunity columns in
national newspapers;
• business investment magazines which
devote their entire contents to
reviewing a number of well-researched
projects every month;
• business brokers and accountants who
offer an intermediary 'marriage
bureau' service linking investors to
investee companies of all sizes;
• direct mail list suppliers with
sophisticated computer databases of a
large number of companies, carefully
analysed by various criteria;
• not-for-profit business introduction
services which provide opportunities
for investors to see presentations and
be introduced to selected
entrepreneurs on a regular basis;
• market research documents which
cover an industry in considerable
detail and identify all the players by
turnover, profitability, region, etc.
Subsequently, the syndicate began to
be approached by entrepreneurs with
investment propositions. The syndicate
found no shortage of deals available for
consideration.
The selection procedure which the
syndicate developed was as follows: Blair,
the syndicate co-ordinator, would initially
eliminate any proposal that did not look
financially viable. This accounted for
about 80 per cent of the deal flow. He
then circulated brief details of the
remaining 20 per cent of businesses to
syndicate members for their first
appraisal. These would be followed up
with a longer, illustrated report entitled

'Metroventure' con ta1n1ng the key
elements of the proposal for
consideration by syndicate members. The
next step consisted of the appointment of
a project leader, selected for his
knowledge of the industry under review.
The project leader, in tum, would invite
two syndicate members to join him in the
in-depth investigation and appraisal
process. This project team would then
arrange to visit the investee company
armed with the various checklists to
enable them to carry out in-depth
assessment
of
the
company's
requirements, personnel, marketplace,
etc.
In the final stage of the appraisal
process the team would distil the project
and convey their conclusions to a full
syndicate meeting. A consensus decision
of the entire syndicate was required for
an investment to be agreed. When a
selected project was considered
commercially viable, a formal offer letter
would be submitted to the target
company. At the same time, the team who
had researched the project might
recommend how to structure and to
apportion an investment proposition and
which syndicate member might
participate in the hands-on management
function within the investee company.
The Metrogroup informal investor
syndicate remained in operation for
nearly two years (1986-88). During that
period, out of 150 projects that had been
received some 15 were analysed and
reported in depth. In the event, the
syndicate did not make any investments
using common syndicate funds, although
three individual syndicate members made
investments in three projects. The
syndicate was dissolved in early 1988
having utilised the majority of its
founders' capital, the bulk of its funds

<-----Page 7----->Why 'Business Angels' Say No: A Case Study of Opportunities Rejected by an Informal Investor Syndicate I 41

having been expended on overheads,
market research and the development of
systems. Blair (1996) provides a critical
post-mortem on why Metrogroup failed
and describes his experience of
attempting to create a second informal
investor syndicate based on different
principles.

Characteristics of Rejected Investment
Opportunities
The majority of the investment
opportunities considered and rejected by
Metrogroup arose from approaches made
to the syndicate by an entrepreneur,
company or an accountant or broker
acting on behalf of an entrepreneur
(Table 1). Somewhat unusually for an
informal investor syndicate, the members
of the Metrogroup syndicate did not rely
exclusively on their own social and
business networks to identify investment
opportunities: they also advertised in the
financial press and were listed in venture
capital reference books and on databases.
Most of the companies that Metrogroup
approached were identified through
business introduction services. The single
most significant source of such
opportunities was businesses making
presentations at LINC's investor club

meetings (Mason and Harrison, 1993).
The deals considered and rejected by
Metrogroup were characterised by great
diversity. In terms of their stage of
development (Table 2) pre-start-ups, startups, early stage and established businesses
were all well represented. The investment
opportunities also included two companies
seeking funding for a management buyout (MBO) and two companies in
receivership. A further two companies
were subsequently revealed to be insolvent
(and hence trading illegally) and three
others required rescue finance.
Metrogroup was again unusual for a
private investor syndicate in being
prepared to consider financing insolvent
companies and received a number of deals
from receivers. Its view was that many
insolvent companies had good products
and offered the potential of high rates of
return and had only become insolvent as a
result of poor financial controls which the
syndicate could remedy.
The industrial distribution was equally
diverse (Table 3), although with a bias
towards manufacturing. The location of
the businesses exhibited a strong London
and south east of England bias (69 per
cent). Nevertheless, Metrogroup was
prepared to consider investing regardless

The Rejection Decision: A Process
Perspective
As noted earlier, Metrogroup's
investment decision-making process

involved an initial review stage
undertaken by the archangel, followed by
a detailed evaluation; this broadly
conforms to the standard models in the
venture capital (Hall and Hofer, 1993)
and informal venture capital literature
(e.g. Riding et a~ 1993). The majority of
the investment proposals (22 out of 35)
were rejected by the Metrogroup

syndicate at the initial review stage (Table
4) 3. This initial review involved an
examination by the archangel of the
business plan, including a careful scrutiny
of the financial details and, in some cases,
one or more meetings with the
principals. In a number of cases the
entrepreneur was required to provide
more detailed information or respond to
suggested changes in business strategy: in
these situations the initial review process
could be quite protracted, extending
over a number of months. A further two
businesses ruled themselves out of
further consideration at this stage. One
of these companies did not respond to
the syndicate's request for
a
professionally prepared business plan
because it was busy coping with an influx
of new clients. The other company
terminated discussions with Metrogroup
because it rejected the syndicate's
constructive criticism of its proposed
business strategy.
Eleven proposals passed this initial
review stage by the archangel. The
features which attracted the interest of
the syndicate and encouraged them to
investigate these opportunities further

were the growth of the market and the
presence of an entrepreneur or
management team with relevant
experience and skills. However, nine of
these proposals were subsequently
rejected after the syndicate had
conducted its own detailed research on
the marketplace and the principals
(Table 4). Metrogroup was interested in
investing in the remaining two proposals.
However, in one case it withdrew after six
months having failed to reach an
agreement with the company on its
valuation. In the other case, a
management buyout, Metrogroup found
itself in a competitive bidding with
venture capital firms: it did not wish to be
in this situation and so suggested to the
company that it should negotiate
individually with potential backers. In the
event the company found alternative
backers.

Opportunity Rejection Factors
The 32 investment opportunities4 were
rejected by the Metrogroup syndicate for
a total of 61 reasons, a median of 1.5
reasons per opportunity. In Table 5 the

presented in two different ways. The first
column simply lists the frequency with
which each deal rejection factor was
cited. However, some opportunities were
rejected for a combination of related
reasons, thus Table 5 also indicates the
number of opportunities that were
rejected for each set of deal rejection
factors.
Although a considerable variety of deal
rejection reasons were cited, it is clear
that three types of deal killer dominate.
The most frequently cited reasons (in
terms of the total number of times the
factors were mentioned) for rejecting an
investment opportunity were associated
with the characteristics of the
entrepreneur or management team: this
accounted for 36 per cent of all mentions
and 41 per cent of opportunities were
rejected exclusively or in part for this
reason. In particular, the syndicate was
unwilling to invest in businesses that were
'one man shows' and where there were
significant gaps in the management team.
Although Metrogroup's philosophy was
to be a hands-on investor, contributing
relevant skills and expertise, syndicate
members were not prepared to invest in
situations where they would be
responsible for key functions in the dayto-day running of a business.
The importance that Metrogroup
placed on weaknesses in the
entrepreneur/management team in the
rejection decision provides an interesting
contrast with the emphasis given to this
factor by venture capitalists. Sweeting
(1991) notes that some venture capitalists
are prepared to proceed with discussions
to make a deal where weaknesses in the
management team were recognised but
the business concept was otherwise sound
because they were confident that in such
situations they could attract good

managers to replace the existing ones.
However, business angels are less able to
handle downside risk in this way and so
to a much greater extent than venture
capitalists are investing in the
entrepreneur/management team as well
as the business. (Also see Mason et al,
1984 on this point.)
The second most frequently cited deal
killers were marketing/market-related
factors and finance which each received
the same number of mentions (25 per
cent). However, when analysed in terms
of the opportun1t1es themselves,
marketing and market-related factors
were actually the most common reason
why the syndicate rejected an investment
opportunity, accounting entirely or in
part for the rejection of 47 per cent of
investment opportunities. In a number of
cases the syndicate rejected proposals
where the marketing strategy was
considered to be flawed and where the
information was incomplete or lacking
detail (e.g. on potential customers).
Other types of projects which were
rejected included those which were likely
to encounter distributional barriers,
notably games and books, and those
which were judged to be entering highly
competitive
markets.
Financial
considerations accounted in whole or in
part for the rejection of just over onethird of opportunities. In particular, the
syndicate rejected proposals which they
considered to contain flawed or
unrealistic financial projections. As
Roberts (1991) comments, the approach
to the financials provides a good
reflection of the entrepreneur's thinking.
The remaining deal rejection reasons
comprised a number of miscellaneous
factors, of which product attributes was
the most frequently cited. Although these
factors accounted for a small minority of

mentions they were of considerable
significance as deal killers: indeed, 19 per
cent of deals were rejected either entirely
(in four of the six cases) or in part
because of deal-specific factors and
another nine per cent of deals were
rejected in part or entirely because of the
product. Of only limited significance,
however, as deal killers were factors
associated with valuation and size of
equity stakes because the vast majority of
deal rejection decisions were made well
before the negotiation stage where such
issues are discussed.
Most investment opportunities had just
one or two deal killers, with exactly half
(16) rejected on the basis of a single deal
killer (Table 6). Opportunities rejected
after further research were more likely
than those that were rejected at the initial
review stage to be characterised by a
single deal killer (66 per cent cf 45 per
cent); conversely, the latter were more
likely to be characterised by multiple deal
killers. In other words, opportunities that
failed to get past the initial review tended
to be rejected because of the cumulation
of deficiencies, many of which were

associated with the entrepreneur or
management team. Indeed, the
entrepreneur/management team was
never the sole deal killer for
opportunities rejected at the initial
review stage. Those which got to the stage
where they were the subject of detailed
research tended to be rejected on
account of the discovery of a single
fundamental problem which was not
apparent at the outset. Product
deficiencies and miscellaneous factors
(e.g. identification of conflicts of interest;
shareholders in a potential MBO
instigated by the management team did
not wish to sell) were more likely to be
deal killers at this stage. Conversely,
marketing factors were the most common
deficiency for opportunities which were
rejected at the initial review stage by a
single deal killer. In a number of cases
these opportunities were in sectors in
which syndicate members had previous
experience and so were able to make an
intuitive judgement on their deficiencies.

Conclusion
This case study of investment decision-

making by an informal investor syndicate
represents the first attempt to look on a
deal-specific basis at the reasons why
business angels reject investment
opportunities. It is important to
emphasise at the outset that this study has
significant limitations. First, Metrogroup
is an atypical player in the informal
venture capital market. In the UK,
although not in the USA, business angels
are much more likely to invest on their
own rather than as part of a syndicate
(Harrison and Mason, 1992; Gaston,
1989). The fact that 'lone wolf' business
angels have no need to refer their actions
to others suggests that their modus
operandi is likely to be different to that of
investor syndicates. However, this
requires confirmation by research.
Moreover, although there has been no
research on informal investor syndicates,
it seems likely on the basis of anecdotal
evidence (e.g. Conlin, 1989; Spragins,
1991) that Metrogroup is unusual,
notably in terms of its origins, size,
formality and deal sourcing methods.
Moreover, all of its members were virgin
angels. Most informal investor syndicates
are smaller, their members know one
another prior to its formation either
through social or business networks, and
the syndicates's composition may be
fluid, varying from investment to
investment. Thus, it is desirable that this
type of study is replicated on different
types of business angels and larger
samples of investment opportunities,
perhaps by asking angels to provide
details of the last N investment
opportunities that they rejected. In
particular, research based on a larger
sample of business angels and investment
opportunities rejected will allow detailed
exploration of the differential
importance of various groups of deal

rejection criteria at different stages of
project development and across different
sectors.
The second limitation of this study
is that it is methodologically
unsophisticated. It has not been possible
to assess whether any factors are
essential/non-compensatory. The
identification of deal rejection factors at
each stage has been limited. Because the
syndicate did not make any investments it
was not possible to compare the
attributes of opportunities that were
accepted and rejected. And finally, the
use of ex post facto data gathering
techniques allows for the possibility of
inaccuracies in the recall ability of the
respondent which might result in the
importance of certain factors, and the
number of actual criteria involved in the
decision being overstated or understated
(Sandberg et al, 1987; Hall and Hofer,
1993). Further research on this issue
should therefore consider using finer
grained methodologies such as verbal
protocol analysis and cognitive mapping
which are being used to good effect in
the study of investment decision-making
by venture capitalists (Sandberg et al,
1987; Hall and Hofer, 1993; Fausnaugh et
a~ 1993).
With these limitations in mind, the
study has refined and extended our
knowledge of 'why angels say no' in three
respects. First, most investment
opportunities are rejected for just one or
two key reasons. Second, previous studies
which have not adopted a deal-specific
focus have provided a rather broad-brush
set of deal rejection factors. This study
has confirmed that the most common
deal rejection factors are associated with
the entrepreneur/management team,
marketing and finance. It also highlights
the importance of a flawed or incomplete

<-----Page 14----->481 International Small Business Journal 14, 2

marketing strategy and flawed or
incomplete financial projections as
significant deal killers, especially at the
initial review stage and the very minor
significance in the rejection decision of
factors associated with pricing and
structuring of deals. Third, the study has
hinted at differences in the rejection
criteria at different stages of the
evaluation process. It has also suggested
that, with some specific exceptions,
notably where the investment
opportunity is in a sector where the
investor has had experience, deals
rejected at the initial review stage tend to
be on the basis of the cumulation of a
number of deficiencies rather than on
the grounds of a single factor.
The implications of this study for
entrepreneurs seeking finance from a
syndicate of informal investors are threefold: First, the business plan must be welldeveloped and realistic and reflect
professional advice and input. Potential
investors are likely to be turned off by
proposals that are not fully worked out.
Over-optimistic financial projections will
create doubt as to the realistic
expectations of the entrepreneur.
Conversely, plans which contain specific
information and insights about customers
and target markets will give the potential
investor confidence. The plan must also
demonstrate the relevant experience and
abilities of the entrepreneur and
management team and indicate the ways
in which any management gaps will be
filled. The business plan should also be
used to attract the interest of potential
investors by emphasising the financial
and market potential of the enterprise.
Second, although business angels are
likely to reach a quicker decision than
venture capitalists (Freear et a~ 1992) the
entrepreneur must nevertheless be

prepared to engage in protracted
negotiations. The business angel is likely
to require the entrepreneur to prepare a
detailed business plan if one does not
already exist, may require information
from published market research to be
assembled and supplied, may suggest an
alternative business strategy (e.g. for
marketing the product or service) and
may wish to see a pilot product. Ignoring
advice from a business angel when
preparing a revised business plan is likely
to be a deal killer. Entrepreneurs should
therefore allow sufficient time for raising
finance from informal investors: they are
unlikely to be successful if they approach
business angels as a last resort when
under pressure from their banker.
Third, and related to the previous
point, the Metrogroup case study suggests
that a sequential approach, in which the
entrepreneur will approach one potential
investor at a time, rather than an open
approach, in which the entrepreneur
simultaneously approaches a number of
potential investors, to finding an investor
is the more appropriate. The open
approach is attractive in terms of time
and the possibility that a better deal can
be achieved if two or more investors
compete to make the investment,
whereas the sequential approach is more
time-consuming and may be exhausting
and psychologically depressing for the
entrepreneur is rejected (Cary, 1993).
However, business angels are unlikely to
be willing to get into a competitive
situation with other potential investors
and may well walk away.
Finally, the findings of this study also
have implications for business introduction
services. Understanding how business
angels scan investment opportunities and
the factors which they take into account in
their initial review provides valuable

information on what kind of information
should and should not be included in
investment opportunities databases, and

This contrast may reflect differences
between studies in the definition of
"number of investment proposals
considered".
This section is based on Blair (1996).
As noted earlier, this sample of investment
opportunities contains a higher proportion
of proposals which were referred on to the
syndicate
members
for
detailed
consideration (31 per cent) than is the case
for all proposals received by the syndicate
(c.20 per cent). This reflects the availability
of information on these proposals: for a
number of proposals rejected at this first
stage there is no documentary record of the
rejection criteria available.
As the previous section makes clear, three
of the 35 investment opportunities were not
rejected by Metrogroup: in one case the
entrepreneurs did not respond the request
for a professionally prepared business plan;
the company which Metrogroup was
initially in a competitive bidding situation
with did not come back to negotiate with
the syndicate and in the third case the
company chose to terminate discussions
with Metrogroup because of a difference of
opinion over business strategy.
