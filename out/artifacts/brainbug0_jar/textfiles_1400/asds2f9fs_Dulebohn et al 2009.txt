A classic debate in the organizational justice literature concerns the question of whether procedural justice and distributive justice are independent constructs. We investigate this question by using fMRI
methods to examine brain activation patterns associated with procedural and distributive unfairness.
We observed a clear dissociation of activation between these two forms of justice, and only a minimal
amount of shared activation in the hypothesized regions. Speciﬁcally, unfair procedures evoked greater
activation in parts of the brain related to social cognition, such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
(VLPFC) and the superior temporal sulcus (STS), whereas unfair outcomes evoked greater activation in
more emotional areas of the brain, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI) and
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We interpret the ﬁndings as supporting the notion that the
two forms of justice reﬂect distinct constructs, while recognizing that, as forms of justice, they are closely
related nomologically.

Introduction
During the past 25 years, the study of fairness has received major research attention from a variety of disciplines, including economics, psychology, law, and organizational science. Though
justice is viewed as a multidimensional construct consisting of several distinct components, distributive and procedural justice have
received the majority of research attention and have been viewed
as the core dimensions of organizational justice (Colquitt, Conlon,
Wesson, Porter, & Ng, 2001). Distributive justice concerns the fairness of outcomes or resources that individuals receive, while procedural justice focuses on the fairness of the processes used to
allocate such outcomes or resources (Greenberg & Colquitt, 2005).
While the discussion of procedural and distributive justice as
separate constructs has been taken for granted for so long in the
literature as to become almost institutionalized, a key assumption
remains only partially explored: do people really distinguish between distributive and procedural fairness? The present study
looks to provide neural evidence using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to ascertain whether unique neural activity
is associated with procedural and distributive unfairness. Speciﬁcally, we expect that distributive unfairness generates more neural

activity in emotion-centered areas of the brain, while procedural
unfairness generates more neural activity in cognitive- and social
processing-centered areas of the brain.
Demonstrating that the two types of fairness have dissimilar
neural foundations would provide convincing evidence for the
independence of the two forms of justice. In addition to contributing to theoretical understanding and to the debate on the precise
dimensionality of justice perceptions (e.g., Ambrose & Arnaud,
2005), identifying whether different neural reactions occur would
help guide scholars and practitioners interested in maximizing
fairness or mitigating unfairness in a wide variety of settings. For
example, managers might want to tailor their communication
about decisions to attenuate either emotional or cognitive reactions to potential injustice perceptions. Thus, they may wish to
use different informational items to blunt or counteract either
emotional or cognitive negative reactions if their action relates to
one particular form of injustice linked to one of these reactions.
Additionally, this study offers the possibility of opening the ‘‘black
box” linking justice to behavioral responses. If we ﬁnd that different forms of justice trigger different neural responses, this may
provide explanation to prior ﬁndings that highlight different
behavioral responses in individuals in response to different forms
of injustice. If distributive injustice triggers greater emotional reactions, we would expect to see more emotional behaviors such as
negative personal evaluations of supervisors, withdrawal, or devi-

ance behavior. In contrast, if procedural injustice triggers a more
socio-cognitive response, we would expect to ﬁnd more rational
responses such as reduced commitment or effort.
The distinctiveness of procedural and distributive justice
Support for independence
Colquitt et al. (2001, p. 427) stated that ‘‘Perhaps the oldest debate in the justice literature concerns the independence of procedural and distributive justice.” On one side of the debate stands
research that has had some success distinguishing the justice
forms. For instance, with a sample of 217 middle managers, Greenberg (1986) determined through factor analysis that two dimensions underlie managers’ recollections of particularly fair or
unfair performance evaluations they had received in the past.
Items loading on the ﬁrst factor reﬂected procedural justice criteria
(e.g., consistent application of standards and the ability to challenge or rebut the evaluation) while items loading on the second
factor reﬂected distributive justice criteria (e.g., appraisal rating
based on performance achieved, and salary/promotion recommendations based on appraisal rating). Greenberg (1986, p. 342) noted
that the results supported ‘‘the existence of both procedural and
distributive determinants of fairness.” More recently, Colquitt
(2001) created measures of procedural and distributive justice
using items developed from key early works on distributive (e.g.,
Leventhal, 1976) and procedural (Leventhal, 1980; Thibaut &
Walker, 1975) justice. Using a sample of over 300 undergraduates
and conﬁrmatory analysis techniques, Colquitt found support for
the independence of the two constructs.
A second method used to demonstrate the independence of the
two forms of justice has been to ascertain whether procedural justice explains unique amounts of variance over and above the variance explained by distributive justice. For example, Folger and
Konovsky (1989) found that while distributive justice accounted
for more unique variance in satisfaction with pay, procedural justice accounted for more variance in trust in supervisors and organizational commitment. In addition, McFarlin and Sweeney (1992)
and Sweeney and McFarlin (1993) found distributive justice to be a
more important predictor of the personal outcomes of pay satisfaction and job satisfaction than procedural justice, while procedural
justice was a more important predictor of the organizational outcomes of organizational commitment and subordinate evaluations
of supervisors.
Support for non-independence
In contrast to the above research, a number of other studies
have failed to statistically distinguish between procedural and distributive justice. For instance, some articles have been published
reporting correlations between procedural and distributive justice
greater than .70 (e.g., Sweeney & McFarlin, 1997; Welbourne, Balkin, & Gomez-Mejia, 1995). Many other studies have responded to
high intercorrelations between distributive and procedural justice
measures by combining them into a single ‘‘fairness” measure
rather than trying to defend having multiple justice measures
(e.g., Conlon, Porter, & McLean Parks, 2004; Holbrook & Kulik,
2001; Martocchio & Judge, 1995). These studies beg the question
of why procedural and distributive justice could not be separated
enough in peoples’ judgments to warrant being tested as separate
constructs.
Some concern for the independence of procedural and distributive justice can also be taken from the meta-analytic reviews that
have been performed in the justice literature. For instance, the Colquitt et al. (2001) meta-analysis presented corrected population

141

correlations between distributive justice and various operationalizations of procedural justice that range from a low of .34 to a high
of .77, with most correlations between the two constructs being
above .50. Similarly, the Cohen-Charash and Spector meta-analysis
(2001) presented corrected correlations between distributive and
procedural justice of .55 in ﬁeld studies and .62 in lab studies, with
individual studies in their data set reporting correlations as high as
.89 and .88 in ﬁeld and lab settings, respectively. Finally, a metaanalysis by Viswesvaran and Ones (2002) reported a corrected correlation of .57 between the two forms of justice. Note that Cohen
and Cohen (1983) classiﬁed correlations above .50 as highly
correlated.
Critique
Studies in support of independence can be criticized on several
grounds. For example, the factor analytic techniques used by
Greenberg (1986) involved having coders categorize statements
made by the managerial sample. As a result, procedural and distributive justice evaluations were not directly assessed because
the fairness judgments were made by coders rather than the managers themselves. In addition, many studies documenting the unique contributions of procedural and distributive justice on more
distal organizational outcomes can be criticized because they involve retrospective accounts as well as other methodological concerns (single survey, single source, self-report data).
Similar concerns can be raised with studies supporting the nonindependence perspective. For instance, Conlon et al. (2004) speculated that the justice items in their study were highly correlated
because their scenario study design did not allow participants to
experience procedures independently from the outcomes—participants merely read about a procedure being applied followed by the
outcome it generated. Such beliefs coincide with arguments by
Cropanzano and Ambrose (2001) who argued that in many situations, procedural and distributive justice may be difﬁcult to disentangle because evaluations of procedures may be in part
determined by the outcomes one receives from those procedures.
Furthermore, while from a temporal perspective the experience
of procedures precedes the receipt of outcomes, in most studies
both justice forms are measured only after outcomes are received,
thereby allowing outcomes to inﬂuence both justice judgments.
As a result, prior studies supporting either perspective have not
adequately answered the question of whether procedural justice
and distributive justice are independent. The current study is the
ﬁrst to use objective physiological evidence to examine whether
procedural and distributive justice are distinct. The study also utilizes a method that temporally separates and measures reactions
to the justice dimensions. Our thesis is that distributive injustice
reactions stemming from unfavorable outcomes will generate neural activity in emotion-centered areas of the brain, whereas procedural injustice reactions stemming from unfavorable procedures
will lead to more neural activity in social cognition-centered regions of the brain.
Neuroscience and the study of unfairness
Using advances in non-invasive techniques such as functional
magnetic resonance imaging, neuroscientists have been able to
identify and map areas of the brain associated with speciﬁc human
activity. This research has served as the basis for understanding
principles of brain functioning and organizing in important areas
such as how people react to rewards (Camerer, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2005; Walter, Abler, Ciaramidaro, & Erk, 2005). Functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) uses magnetic ﬁelds to isolate
active areas of the brain from non-active areas during a speciﬁed

<-----Page 2----->142

task or condition. This information can then be used to identify
functional contrast between tasks or across conditions. Increased
neuronal activity is associated with changes in blood ﬂow and
deoxygenated hemoglobin. Deoxygenated hemoglobin is associated with ‘‘magnetic ﬂux” or the increase of ‘‘magnetic susceptibility of blood vessels relative to the surrounding brain tissue” and
these appear as gradient distortions in fMRI images (Matthews,
2001, p. 11). This effect is referred to as the blood oxygenation level
dependent (BOLD) response; images of the BOLD response signal
the extent of the distortion of the applied magnetic ﬁeld (from
the scanner) resulting from a change in hemoglobin oxygenation
(Matthews, 2001).
Neuroscience research utilizing fMRI has approached fairness
exclusively in terms of reactions to outcomes. This research has
provided insight into the neural activity occurring when individuals reject offers that they perceive to be low or unfair (e.g., Falk,
Fehr, & Fischbacher, 2003; Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2003). A typical approach has been to examine subjects’ reactions in ultimatum bargaining contexts (Camerer & Thaler, 1995).
‘‘Fairness” in this type of task is generally deﬁned as an equal distribution of the total sum (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008).
This research has demonstrated that negative emotions and motivation, such as anger and perceptions of unfairness, play an important role in participant decision-making in monetary games and
speciﬁcally in the acceptance and rejection of offers.
Our review of the literature indicates that no fMRI studies on
fairness have examined procedural fairness reactions. Instead, fairness has been conceptualized only in terms of distributive justice.
In the current study we examined both procedural and distributive
injustice to determine the extent to which they are instantiated in
distinct or overlapping brain regions. We focused our analysis on
ﬁve areas that researchers, using an array of tasks, have found to
be commonly implicated in social cognition and decision-making
research: the dorsolateral and ventrolateral sectors of the prefrontal cortex (DLPFC and VLPFC, respectively), the anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC), the anterior insula (AI), and superior temporal sulcus
(STS).
Regarding the DLPFC, two recent studies used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to disrupt processing in the
DLPFC while players were participating in an ultimatum game
(Knoch et al., 2006; van ‘t Wout, Kahn, Sanfey, & Aleman, 2005).
In both studies, rTMS stimulation inﬂuenced responses to unfair
offers, which provides strong evidence for a causal relation between activation in this area and decision making in the context
of perceived distributive injustice. In addition, the DLPFC has been
associated with negative affect (Nitschke, Sarinopoulos, Mackiewicz, Schaefer, & Davidson, 2006). The ACC is an area associated
with both affective processing and conﬂict monitoring (Botvinick,
Cohen, & Carter, 2004; Kerns et al., 2004; Nitschke et al., 2006). Finally, the AI is an area commonly associated with negative emotion, anger and disgust, pain and distress, and autonomic arousal
(Critchley, Elliott, Mathias, & Dolan, 2000; Damasio et al., 2000;
Derbyshire et al., 1997; Nitschke et al., 2006). The DLPFC, ACC
and AI regions have all been found to respond to outcome unfairness (e.g., Sanfey et al., 2003), which in this context refers exclusively to distributive injustice.
The remaining two areas we focused on have been implicated in
social processing and decision making. Sanfey (2007) has identiﬁed
the STS as one of the brain areas implicated in social decision-making studies. The STS has also been associated with reﬂective thinking tasks and social processing (Gallagher & Frith, 2003; Pelphrey,
Morris, & McCarthy, 2004; Saxe, 2006). The VLPFC has been associated with social evaluation, reappraisal, and reducing social distress (Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003; Ochsner, Bunge,
Gross, & Gabrieli, 2002), as well as the suppression of emotional
reactions (Tabibnia et al., 2008).

Hypothesis development
In considering the possibility of distinctions in the neural representation of procedural and distributive justice evaluations, we
rely on prior justice research as well as fMRI research on decision
behavior. For example, Satpute and Lieberman (2006) proposed a
dual processing approach to brain functioning that categorized
cognitive processes as ‘‘reﬂexive” and ‘‘reﬂective” which share similarities with other categorizations of cognitive processing that
have been used (e.g., Camerer et al., 2005; Schneider & Shiffrin,
1977). For example, emotional reactions to rewards or punishments represent reﬂexive responses to speciﬁc stimuli. In contrast,
reﬂective processes are typically more deliberative, and include
activities such as reﬂecting on social context and taking prior
knowledge into account (Satpute & Lieberman, 2006).
Let us now consider the consequences of receiving an outcome
that is likely to generate distributive injustice. The receipt of an unfair outcome that is lower than one expects or perceives they deserve is likely to result in emotional responses consistent with
reﬂexive forms of information processing, with anger or possibly
resentment toward the person responsible for the outcome (Hegtvedt, 1990; Hegtvedt & Killian, 1999). Consistent with this notion
are theoretical arguments suggesting that those who experience
distributive injustice are likely to feel anger and even outrage
(e.g., Bies & Moag, 1986). Adam’s (1965) theory of inequity posits
that the experience of distributive injustice will result in inequity
distress or psychological uneasiness. Based on this and prior ﬁndings on the ﬁve brain regions of interest described, we expect that
the immediate evaluation of unfair reward outcomes, or distributive injustice, will be characterized by responses involving emotional areas of the brain as well as areas related to conﬂict
monitoring as the perception of an unfair offer likely represents
an expectancy violation that triggers a rapid neural response. Speciﬁcally, we expect neural activity in the ACC (associated with cognitive and affective processing, conﬂict monitoring, and reaction to
unfair offers), the AI (associated with negative affect, anger, automatic arousal, and reaction to unfair offers), and the DLPFC (associated with negative affect and reaction to unfair offers).
Hypothesis 1. Distributive injustice will evoke greater neural
activity in emotion-centered areas of the brain, speciﬁcally, the
ACC, DLPFC, and AI brain regions, compared to procedural injustice.
In contrast, procedural injustice is likely to elicit a sense-making
process indicative of more reﬂective, social information processing
on the part of the individual. In our experiment, we operationalized procedural injustice in terms of violations of Leventhal’s
(1980) procedural justice rules. We expect that the deliberation
or evaluation of unfairness in procedures would be less emotional
and would involve greater activity in social network regions than
for distributive injustice described earlier. Speciﬁcally, we expect
there to be greater activation in the VLPFC, the area that has been
found to be active in social processing, recollection, and emotion
regulation. In this case, we expect the VLPFC to be active because
the person would be reﬂecting on the procedure experienced in
comparison to their own ideas of what a fair procedure should
be, along with the information they received as to what would constitute a fair procedure in the study. In addition, we expect greater
activation in the STS since this area has been found to be active in
social processing tasks. When evaluating procedural injustice, individuals may reﬂect on the decision-maker’s behavior in terms of
rule adherence. We would expect the STS to be involved in reﬂecting on another’s behavior in rule violation while possibly taking socio-contextual information and prior knowledge into account.
The notion that procedural injustice will generate less of an
emotional response and involve brain areas related to reﬂection

<-----Page 3----->J.H. Dulebohn et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 140–151

and recall more so than distributive injustice is consistent with
arguments made by Folger and colleagues (Cropanzano & Folger,
1991; Folger & Martin, 1986). These justice scholars contend that
while the perception of distributive injustice leads to an adverse
emotional state, the perception of unfair procedures leads to very
little negative emotion if it is not connected to an unfair outcome.
Similarly, Stecher and Rosse (2005, pp. 232–233) stated, ‘‘Simply
put, people are not likely to become emotionally aroused about unfair organizational procedures that are inconsequential.” Thus, procedural injustice information should not in and of itself lead to
strong emotional reactions or resentment in the absence of outcome information. Emotional reaction to a violation of procedural
justice rules is expected to be minimal or even suppressed while
participants wait for the distributive outcome that will result when
they subsequently play the ultimatum game.
Hypothesis 2. Procedural injustice will invoke greater neural
activity in social processing areas of the brain, speciﬁcally, the
VLPFC and STS regions, compared to distributive injustice.

Method
Initial study sample and selection protocol
We identiﬁed participants for this study in a two-stage process.
First, as part of a study unrelated to the current research, 161
undergraduate students (81 male and 80 female) completed an online survey that captured demographic and personality information along with participant judgments pertaining to a simulated
decision scenario. At the end of this online survey, participants
were informed of the opportunity to participate in a second study
that would entail making decisions while in an fMRI scanner. Those
who indicated a willingness to participate were subsequently contacted for our study. A total of 62 students were contacted; of this
set, 17 students indicated they were no longer interested in the
study. Five were not eligible due to medical issues, and 16 others
were either out of the area during the period we were scanning
or not available during the scanning times we offered. We scanned
24 participants (12 male, 12 female) who met our selection criteria,
a sample size common in fMRI studies (c.f., Eisenberger et al., 2003;
Gehring & Willoughby, 2002).
fMRI study procedure
Upon arrival at the radiology lab, each participant received
30 min of training that included fMRI safety instruction and a com-

143

prehensive description of the tasks they would perform while in
the scanner. Due to previous research that has shown that reactions differ when participants know they are playing a computer
and not a human being (e.g., Sanfey et al., 2003), the participants
were told that they would be playing 36 ‘‘rounds” of the ultimatum
game ‘‘live” with other same-sex participants sitting in the computer lab used to administer the online survey, and that they
would be paired with a different partner in each round, and never
the same partner twice. We took steps to indicate to the participants that we were setting up and coordinating communication
with the computer lab. In actuality, the ‘‘other” participants’ actions were programmed into our computerized protocol. In addition, to prime the procedural justice manipulation the
experimenter conducting the training continually and overtly
stressed the accuracy and fairness of the experimental procedure
to be used.
Participants were then placed into the fMRI scanner and the
experiment commenced. Fig. 1 presents a graphic representation
of what events occurred on each round of the ultimatum game.
Each round lasted exactly 1 min and 14 s and contained two
parts. In the ﬁrst part, participants answered three math questions, in multiple-choice format, to determine their role (proposer or responder) in the second part, the ultimatum game.
Participants were given 6 s to answer each math question by
pressing the appropriate key on a keypad strapped to their hand.
After answering the questions, participants were presented with
a ﬁxation screen for 12 s (during which time the grader was
ostensibly scoring the answers); this was followed by a screen
informing participants of the grading results, followed 6 s later
by the screen indicating whether they would be the proposer
or the responder during the second (ultimatum game) part of
that round, along with the rationale behind the role assignment.
For responder trials (the focus of this paper), participants next
received a ﬁxation screen for 6 s (during which the proposer
was ostensibly selecting an offer to propose). Next, the proposer
offer was shown to the participant for 6 s, during which the participant indicated with their keypad whether they accepted or
rejected the proposal. A 12 s ﬁxation screen was presented at
the end of each trial. For trials where the participant was the
proposer, a ﬁxation screen appeared for 6 s after the role assignment, followed by a screen displaying the four distribution
choices, from which the participant chose to send one as the
proposed offer; the four choices remained for 6 s, after which a
ﬁxation screen appeared for 6 s (during which the receiver was
ostensibly choosing to accept or reject the offer). A 12 s ﬁxation
screen was also presented at the end of these trials. This struc-

turing allowed us to keep the length of every trial the same
whether the participant was in the role of proposer or
responder.
All participants were informed that the outcomes in terms of
accepted or rejected offers would not be revealed until after all
36 rounds were completed. Each participant was placed in the responder role for 24 of the 36 rounds, and these are the rounds we
focused on in our analyses. The order of the 36 rounds was randomly assigned. There were a total of six functional scan runs, each
consisting of four responder rounds and two proposer rounds. The
length of each scan run was 7 min and 32 s, with the participants
being scanned the entire time. To make the distributions salient
to the participants, participants were told that their compensation
was partly determined by the ultimatum game. In addition to a
base compensation received, participants were told that they
would also receive the value for their side of a round of the ultimatum game, randomly selected by a computer program, if the proposed distribution on the chosen round had been accepted by
the person in the responder role. If the proposed distribution on
the chosen round had been rejected by the person in the responder
role, parties would receive no compensation above the base
amount.
Procedural justice manipulation
We manipulated procedurally unfair (and fair) conditions by
violating (or not violating) the rules that participants were told
would be followed in determining relative performance on the
math test. Participants were told during the thirty minute training
period that if they answered more questions correctly than the
person they were paired with on that round, they would be the
proposer on that round; otherwise, they would be the responder.
If the two players were tied after the three questions, there would
be a fourth ‘‘tie breaker” question. In addition, to speciﬁcally reinforce the procedural justice manipulation, the participants were
assured during their training that the grading was 100% accurate
and always fairly administered.
To create the procedurally unfair conditions, we violated these
rules in a variety of ways, unfairly assigning participants to the responder role in some of the rounds. Our violations included telling
participants that: (1) they missed math questions even when they
were very simple and unlikely to be answered incorrectly; (2) only
one question was graded and they got it wrong; (3) they would be
the responder even though they got more questions right since the
other player got the hardest question right; (4) they were tied with
the other player but the grader ﬂipped a coin instead of giving
them a tie-breaker question, and they lost the coin ﬂip; (5) the
computer did not record their answers; and (6) they had fewer correct answers, when they had an easy math question that contained
no correct answer to choose. The effect of all of these violations
was to unfairly place the participant into the responder role which,
they were told, is the disadvantaged role in the ultimatum game. In
the procedurally fair conditions, participants’ answers were scored
and the results presented without any information that would suggest any rule violation had occurred. On half of these ‘‘fair” rounds,
participants’ scores were reported to be lower than their opponent
and thus they were assigned to the responder role; on the other
half of these rounds participants’ scores were reported to be higher
than their opponent and thus they were assigned to the proposer
role.
The six manipulations were drawn from the procedural characteristics noted by Leventhal, Karuza, and Fry (1980) as indicative of
fair procedures. According to Leventhal and colleagues, fairness is
enhanced when procedures are accurate, consistent, and suppress
bias. The six unfair conditions used violated one or more of these
characteristics of fair procedures. To insure that our manipulations
were in fact perceived as procedurally unfair, we conducted a

manipulation check study with a separate sample of 56 additional
undergraduate students who participated in an ultimatum game in
a computer lab. The game structure for this sample was identical to
the structure participants in the fMRI study faced; the only difference was that on each round, participants answered a procedural
fairness question (‘‘the role assignment procedure used on this
round was fair”) on a 7-point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and
7 = strongly agree. This question was asked on each round after
the role assignment decision was made, but before they received
the offer from their opponent. Results revealed that ratings for
the unfair conditions ranged from 2.05 to 2.91 (with an overall
mean of 2.43), whereas the ratings for the fair rounds averaged
5.33. Using paired samples t-tests with Bonferroni corrections set
at .01 to account for family-wide alpha inﬂation, we found that
every unfair condition was perceived as signiﬁcantly less fair than
the fair conditions, and that no unfair condition was seen as significantly less fair than any other unfair condition. Combining the unfair rounds and comparing them to the fair rounds revealed strong
support for our manipulation as the procedurally unfair rounds
were perceived as signiﬁcantly less fair than the procedurally fair
rounds, t(55) = 14.15, p < .001.
Distributive justice manipulation
We manipulated distributive justice via the proposals participants received in the ultimatum game when they were in the responder role. Participants learned in the training that the
proposer has the option of offering the responder one of four different distributions of ten dollars. Two distributions (when the responder was offered $4 or $5 of the $10 available) were coded as
distributively fair outcomes; the other two distributions (when
the responder was offered $1 or $2 of the $10 available) were
coded as distributively unfair outcomes. These distributions have
been identiﬁed in prior studies as representative of fair and unfair
outcomes (e.g., Camerer & Thaler, 1995; Dickinson, 2000; Sanfey
et al., 2003). When participants were proposers, they chose from
the same set of distribution options: $9 (self) and $1 (other), $8
and $2, $6 and $4, or $5 and $5.
Functional neuroimagery analysis
All analyses were carried out using AFNI (Cox, 1996). Individual
subject data were slice-time corrected to correct for temporal offsets in the acquisition of slices, and motion corrected to the functional image closest in time to the acquisition of the highresolution anatomical images to optimize alignment. Individual
participant time series data were then converted to percent signal
change by dividing each time series value by the mean signal value
and multiplying by 100. Single-subject time series were then analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) with separate regressors
for procedural and distributive justice, formed by convolving stimulus onset times with an ideal hemodynamic response function.
Procedural justice onset times coincided with the onset of the
screen indicating whether a participant would be a proposer or a
responder and the reasoning behind the role assignment (fair or
unfair), and distributive justice onset times coincided with the onset of the screen presenting the proposer’s offer (fair or unfair).
Additional regressors included in the GLM analyses were end-oftrial ﬁxation screen segments, math problem segments, math results, and regressors for the proposer trials. In addition, the estimated motion time courses were included as motion covariates
to model variance due to residual head motion (Johnstone et al.,
2006). Resultant percentage signal change maps from the GLM
were transformed into the standardized Talairach space via identiﬁcation of anatomical landmarks on the high-resolution SPGR
(Talairach & Tournoux, 1988).

We present the results of three analyses. Our ﬁrst analysis focused on comparing reactions to procedural unfairness and distributive unfairness information. To statistically evaluate the main
hypotheses that procedural and distributive injustice would show
distinct activation patterns within the DLPFC, VLPFC, ACC, AI and
STS, a voxel-wise Student’s paired t-test compared reactions in
these two conditions. Using the anatomical boundaries of the speciﬁed structures, we applied a small volume correction for multiple
comparisons using Monte Carlo simulations (AlphaSim in AFNI).
The spatial correlation of the input data and an uncorrected p value
threshold of 0.0001 resulted in a minimum cluster size of 197 mm3
for this voxel-wise t-test to achieve a corrected p < .05. In addition
to region of interest (ROI) analysis, a whole-brain analysis was conducted. The spatial correlation of the input data and an uncorrected p value threshold of .0001 resulted in a minimum cluster
size of 323 mm3 for the whole-brain voxel-wise t-test to achieve
a corrected p < .05.
Our second analysis concerned searching for areas activated by
both forms of injustice. To identify areas of activation overlap, a
conjunction analysis was performed. In this analysis, voxel-wise
Student’s paired t-tests compared the procedural and distributive
injustice conditions to baseline ﬁxation levels for the procedural
and distributive periods separately. Methods described for the ﬁrst
analysis were used to estimate activation to procedural and distributive justice as well as the baseline activation for the 12 s period at the end of each trial. The small volume correction threshold
of 197 mm3 at the uncorrected threshold of p < .0001 was again applied to achieve a corrected map-wise p < .05 across the hypothesized areas.
In addition to ROI analysis, a whole-brain brain analysis was
conducted. The whole-brain cluster size threshold of 323 mm3 at
the uncorrected threshold of p < .0001 was again applied to achieve
a corrected map-wise p < .05. We then performed a conjunction
procedure (Nichols, Brett, Andersson, Wager, & Poline, 2005; Nitschke et al., 2006; Sarinopoulos, Dixon, Short, Davidson, & Nitschke, 2006) yielding a brain mask containing only those voxels
that were signiﬁcantly activated above voxel-wise threshold
(p = .0001) in each of the two contrasts. The focus of this conjunction analysis was overlapping thresholded regions that met the
additional small volume (197 mm3) criteria and fell within the
anatomical boundaries of each of the ﬁve hypothesized regions
(Lancaster et al., 2000; Talairach & Tournoux, 1988), as implemented in AFNI. We also examined overlapping thresholded activation clusters in regions other than our hypothesized areas that
met the additional criteria (323 mm3) for the whole-brain analysis.
Our third analysis was exploratory and focused on two other
comparisons involving: (1) procedural justice and procedural
injustice, and (2) distributive justice and distributive injustice.
Methods described for the ﬁrst analysis were again used to estimate activation to procedural and distributive justice conditions.
Separate voxel-wise Student’s paired t-tests were used to compare
reactions to justice and injustice conditions for each justice category, and the aforementioned procedures were again applied to
correct for multiple comparisons for ROI and whole-brain analyses.

Results
Distributive injustice compared to procedural injustice
To determine the extent to which procedural and distributive
injustice are instantiated in distinct regions of the brain, we directly compared activation to procedural versus distributive injustice using a voxel-wise contrast (p < .05, corrected). We restricted
our search volume to the ﬁve regions previously discussed as com-

monly activated in social decision-making research (the DLPFC and
VLPFC, ACC, AI, and STS).
Hypothesis 1 stated that the experience of distributive injustice
would lead to greater activation in the DLPFC, ACC, and AI (all previously identiﬁed in social decision-making studies, including ultimatum games examining distributive unfairness), relative to
procedural injustice. Results are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2.
As can be seen in Table 1, areas of greater activation for distributive
injustice than procedural injustice included the DLPFC (both left
and right), ACC (both rostral and dorsal), and AI/mid insula (right).
Thus, Hypothesis 1 received considerable support. Fig. 2 presents
the neuroimaging results related to the three hypothesized areas.
Panel A presents the results for the DLPFC, panel B presents the results for the ACC, and panel C presents the results for the AI. The
ﬁrst brain image in each panel displays the results of a voxel-wise
t-test comparing activation in response to distributive versus procedural injustice. Blue and bright blue areas showed greater activation for distributive injustice than procedural injustice, whereas
orange and bright orange areas showed greater activation for procedural injustice than distributive injustice. Bar graphs of the circled clusters, indicated by black arrows, illustrate average
percentage signal change for distributive and procedural injustice
(the two bar graphs for the DLPFC represent the left and right
hemispheres; the two bar graphs for the ACC represent the rostral

right hemisphere). Error bars are for conﬁdence intervals around
the mean after adjusting for between-subject variance (Cumming
& Finch, 2005; Loftus & Masson, 1994).
In addition to the hypothesized regions, greater activation for
distributive injustice was observed in the ventral striatum, hippocampus, parietal cortex, and other areas of the dorsal visual processing pathway (e.g., cuneus, precuneus). A list of the regions of
greater activation in response to distributive injustice compared
to procedural injustice is presented in Table 1.
Hypothesis 2 stated that the experience of procedural injustice
would lead to greater activation in the VLPFC and STS (areas of the
brain connected to more reﬂective, social processing and emotion
regulation), relative to distributive injustice. Results are presented
in Table 2 and Fig. 3. As can be seen in Table 2, areas of greater activation for procedural injustice than distributive injustice included
the VLPFC (left and right), and the STS (left). Thus, Hypothesis 2
was supported. Fig. 3 presents the neuroimaging results related
to the two hypothesized areas. Panel A presents the results for
the VLPFC, and panel B presents the results for the STS. The ﬁrst

Distributive injustice and procedural injustice compared to baseline
To determine whether any subregions of the hypothesized areas
would be recruited by both procedural and distributive injustice,
activation to each injustice condition was compared to baseline
(ﬁxation cross) using a voxel-wise contrast (p < .05, corrected).
These results can be seen in Table 3. The second brain image in

greater activation for procedural injustice than baseline but not
distributive injustice than baseline.
Using our predetermined voxel-wise threshold (p < .0001), no
overlap was observed in the ACC, left or right VLPFC, and right
STS regions, and the extent of overlap in the left STS was only
13%. Overlap in the left and right DLPFC was also minimal (5%
and 7%, respectively). The greatest amount of overlap was in the
right and left AI regions (28% and 18%, respectively). As noted in

Table 3, activation clusters for the AI were more anterior, the
DLPFC clusters were more posterior, and the STS cluster was largely more posterior, and the only cluster showing any overlap with
clusters indentiﬁed in the procedural injustice versus distributive
injustice contrast (Tables 1 and 2). In addition to these regions,
the bilateral striatum, dorsal MPFC, fusiform gyrus and areas of
the dorsal visual processing pathway (e.g., cuneus, precuneus) also
showed overlap between distributive injustice relative to baseline
and procedural injustice relative to baseline contrasts.
Comparing distributive justice to distributive injustice and procedural
justice to procedural injustice
Our ﬁnal analysis was exploratory and investigated brain activation of distributive injustice to distributive justice, and procedural injustice to procedural justice. While the focus of the study
was on neural activity for procedural and distributive injustice,
in this analysis we explored the question as to whether there are
differences in neural activity for fairness versus unfairness for
the two constructs. The purpose of this analysis was to further
probe the neural correlates of unfairness in the hypothesized regions. Results showed that activation to distributive injustice relative to distributive justice was in the predicted direction but did
not reach the threshold signiﬁcance level for the dorsal ACC, DLPFC
and insula regions. For procedural justice, greater activation to procedural injustice than procedural justice was found for the VLPFC
(left and right) and STS (left and right) regions.
Discussion
The goal of the present study was to provide insight into one of
the classic questions in the justice literature: are procedural and
distributive justice distinct constructs? The paradigm employed
in this study allowed us to delineate the respective distributive justice and procedural justice contributions to the hemodynamic responses elicited by injustice. Our hypotheses received
considerable support. Areas that activated more to distributive
injustice than procedural injustice were the DLPFC, ACC, and AI.
All three areas have previously been shown to activate in ultimatum game paradigms when distributive injustice is experienced
(i.e., when the responder faces an unfair offer, c.f., Sanfey, 2007).
For instance, anterior insula regions have shown greater activation
when unfair offers are proposed, and such activation has also correlated with the degree of unfairness and with the decision to reject unfair offers (Sanfey, 2007; Sanfey et al., 2003). The role of
the ACC [particularly the region bordering the medial PFC (MPFC)]
in cognitive conﬂict and related processes is well documented
(Amodio & Frith, 2006; Botvinick et al., 2004; Kerns et al., 2004).
Such cognitive conﬂict is analogous to the inequity distress experienced when the responder receives an unfair offer. In addition to
the previously reported DLPFC, AI, and dorsal ACC activation in response to distributive injustice, we also observed activation in the
rostral ACC region. Rostral ACC and adjacent MPFC activation is frequently observed in emotion processing paradigms (Bush, Luu, &
Posner, 2000; Nitschke et al., 2006; Steele & Lawrie, 2004), but
may in fact subserve metacognitive representations of basic emotional as well as more complex social experiences (Amodio & Frith,
2006).
Areas that activated more to procedural injustice than distributive injustice were the VLPFC and STS regions. Although there is no
prior research linking procedural injustice with neuroimaging data,
a number of other studies have found activity in these regions
using experimental paradigms that include characteristics that
we believe are applicable to our study. For instance, the VLPFC
plays an important role in social evaluation (Cunningham, Johnson,

Gatenby, Gore, & Banaji, 2003) and reappraisal (Ochsner et al.,
2002, 2004). VLPFC activation is often associated with emotion regulation, inhibitory control, and social distress reduction (Bunge,
Ochsner, Desmond, Glover, & Gabrieli, 2001; Chiu, Holmes, & Pizzagalli, 2008; Eisenberger et al., 2003). These responses, we feel,
are more consistent with reactions to procedural than distributive
information, and consistent with the arguments made by justice
scholars that unfair procedures by themselves will elicit less adverse emotional states (Cropanzano & Folger, 1991; Stecher & Rosse, 2005). Activation in this area has also been associated with the
suppression of negative emotion (Tabibnia et al., 2008); the suppression of negative emotion is often an integral part of how one
deals with unfair procedures, especially in hierarchical settings
such as organizations. Turning to the STS region, we note that
STS activation has been associated with reﬂective thinking tasks
including processing of rules and beliefs in social contexts (Gallagher & Frith, 2003; Pelphrey et al., 2004; Saxe, 2006). Although this
is not the only function this area has been associated with (Hein &
Knight, 2008), reﬂective thinking regarding rules and their application may be central to procedural injustice reactions.
Ultimately, we believe the results provide evidence that procedural and distributive justice are distinct because violations of
these forms of justice lead to differential levels of hemodynamic
activity in different brain regions hypothesized to be related to
the two different justice constructs. The observed dissociation does
not mean that responses to procedural and distributive injustice
rely on completely distinct neural substrates. In fact, comparing
each condition to ﬁxation baseline revealed a moderate degree of
overlap particularly in the AI region. Finding some overlap should
not be surprising as procedural and distributive justice are closely
related nomologically, and the brain likely relies on similar mechanisms (categorization, inference, attention and working memory
components) to cognitively process unpleasant information
whether of a processual or outcome nature. For example, the ﬁnding of anterior insula co-activation is consistent with the idea that
both distributive and procedural injustice can elicit negative emotions. The anterior insula has been implicated in a broad range of
functions including anticipation and response of aversive stimuli,
emotion imitation, unpleasant taste, pain, and disgust (Carr, Iacoboni, Dubeau, Mazziotta, & Lenzi, 2003; Nitschke et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 1998; Sarinopoulos et al., 2006; Sawamoto et al., 2000).
In terms of strength of response, however, the ﬁnding that the
anterior insula is preferentially responsive to distributive injustice
is consistent with theoretical models postulating greater emotional
response to distributive rather than procedural injustice (Cropanzano & Folger, 1991; Folger & Martin, 1986; Stecher & Rosse, 2005).
Strengths, limitations, and future research
One of the advantages that fMRI studies can offer is the advantage of assessing reactions to procedures as procedural information
is conveyed to the participant, rather than waiting to measure
reactions after participants have also received outcome information. Being able to collect data in this fashion gives us conﬁdence
that what we are assessing is in fact reactions to the procedure,
and not reactions to the procedure confounded by the outcome.
This may explain why so many studies in the past have been plagued by high correlations between the two forms of justice, as
many of these studies wait to assess procedural justice until outcomes have also been revealed. Outcome information can have a
strong impact on reactions to procedures (e.g., Conlon, Lind, & Lissak, 1989), leading procedural reactions to covary with outcome
favorability. This is why timing of procurement of procedural and
distributive justice evaluation measures is critical. Ideally, procedural justice reactions should be assessed prior to the receipt of
outcome (distributive justice) information. While questionnaire

<-----Page 9----->J.H. Dulebohn et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 140–151

measures in many studies—especially experimental studies—could
be procured in such a way that procedural justice reactions are not
contaminated by the receipt of distributive justice information,
such a bifurcation rarely is implemented. Data collected via fMRI
methods provide the opportunity for the researcher to collect
objective biological data that are less susceptible to demand characteristics and other biases that plague self-report data.
Our supplemental analyses also provided insight regarding
whether fair procedures and fair outcomes produce similar activation patterns to unfair procedures and unfair outcomes, respectively. Although our results comparing distributive injustice and
distributive justice are not as strong as the results noted by Sanfey
et al. (2003), this may have to do with idiosyncratic elements of our
experimental paradigm (e.g., the provision of procedural justice
information prior to distributive justice information; inclusion of
rounds where the participant was the proposer, etc.). The exploratory analyses involving fair and unfair procedure comparisons revealed greater neural activity for procedural injustice than
procedural justice in both of the hypothesized areas (the VLPFC
and STS areas).
While our study presents some signiﬁcant methodological advances over prior research on procedural justice, it, like any study,
has its share of limitations related to the sample, our research design, and our measures. In terms of sample, we scanned a sample of
undergraduate students who met the criteria of the study parameters (e.g., willingness to be scanned, comfortable in the claustrophobic environment of the scanner, no implants in their body,
etc.), but who may not be representative of the undergraduate population or the more general population. Demonstrating whether
events can occur is a typical goal of laboratory studies (Ilgen,
1985). Nevertheless, subsequent research needs to document that
distributive and procedural justice would be seen as independent
in a more general sample.
In terms of our study design, while our distributive justice
manipulation using the ultimatum game is a common one used
in neuroeconomic and fMRI studies, the procedural justice manipulation was both novel and multifaceted. We used a variety of procedural variations that were drawn from prior procedural justice
work by Leventhal and colleagues (1980). However, compared to
the mathematical elegance of the distributive justice manipulation,
they were less parsimonious. The fMRI context provides some
interesting challenges in terms of delivering procedural justice
information (in terms of the brevity of information that can be
communicated). While the manipulation check data provides us
with conﬁdence that all of our manipulations were seen as procedurally unfair, future work on procedural justice in this context
should carefully consider the implications of different manipulations. For instance, one could argue that our procedural justice
manipulations varied in terms of the source responsible for the
injustice. Telling participants that the grader did not receive their
answers suggests that the source of the injustice is the computer,
whereas telling participants that the grader decided to grade only
the hardest question suggests that the source of the injustice is the
grader. Both explanations violate the justice criterion of accuracy,
but it may be the case that injustice responses differ when they
stem from human versus computer sources.
Finally, in order to maintain realism in the study, we included
many instances (‘‘rounds”) of fair procedures and fair outcomes,
as well as conditions where the participant was the proposer and
not the responder. However, our focus in this study was to determine whether two different forms of justice exist or not, and in
pursuing this goal we focused primarily on respondent reactions
to unjust procedures and unjust outcomes as we deemed these
to be the situations where physiological reactions would be most
likely. Future work is needed that examines differences in neural
activity that may result from fair versus unfair procedures and fair

149

versus unfair outcomes for proposers. Researchers could also
examine how the experience of procedures prior to outcomes
inﬂuences subsequent reactions to those outcomes. For instance,
a person in the responder role may react much more strongly to
an unfair proposal (say, a division of $8 for the proposer and $2
for the responder) when it followed an unfair procedure than they
would when it followed a fair procedure. Alternatively, are fair outcomes that resulted from unfair procedures viewed even more positively than fair outcomes that resulted from fair procedures?

Conclusion
This study used fMRI methodology to examine neural activity
during the evaluation of procedural and distributive injustice. It
represents a ﬁrst step in the investigation of both procedural and
distributive justice and an extension of several other neuroimaging
studies that have only examined distributive justice. As related to
organizational justice, the study demonstrates the usefulness of
this methodological approach for conﬁrming the distinctiveness
of these two forms of justice. In addition, this research underscores
the use of neuroimaging to garner unique insight into unanswered
questions in organizational science, in ways that other approaches
such as paper and pencil questionnaires simply cannot. The study
results provide considerable support for the independence of these
two primary facets of justice. While there was some overlapping
activation, in most of the hypothesized areas the level of overlap
ranged from none at all to a materially insigniﬁcant amount.
Besides informing the debate on the precise dimensionality of
justice perceptions, the ﬁndings can inform practice. The results
support the idea that a targeted and multifaceted approach to
enhancing fairness or mitigating unfairness will be more proﬁtable
than a unilateral approach that treats fairness as a monolithic construct. This ﬁnding has important implications for ﬁrms making
and communicating a range of decisions. For example, consider
the different ways in which a company might deliver news about
performance ratings or pay raises to its employees. Both of these
represent primary and inﬂuential outcomes and signiﬁcant concerns for employees. Our results suggest that simply communicating performance ratings or pay raise decision amounts and
focusing on outcome fairness is inadequate. Managers need to realize the importance of communicating procedural justice rule information and adhering to such rules when conducting performance
evaluations and making pay raise decisions in order to mitigate
negative cognitive reactions and to stimulate activity in areas related to emotional suppression and rule consideration. Research
has found that managers can be trained in procedural justice rules,
leading to enhanced rule adherence (Skarlicki & Latham, 2005), and
the results of our study support the importance of this due to activation in the VLPFC and STS regions when individuals evaluate procedural justice.
Or consider the role of decision acceptance, a typical outcome
variable that has been linked to enhanced procedural justice (e.g.,
Colquitt et al., 2001). The increased decision acceptance resulting
from enhanced levels of procedural justice represents a mechanism that explains why some who feel their performance rating
or pay raise amount is ultimately below expectations do not react
in a negative fashion. Therefore, a general application of the ﬁndings is the need for managers to be aware of and attend to process
aspects, such as adherence to procedural justice rules, knowing
that individuals cognitively evaluate such rules. In addition, there
is the need to manage distributive justice such through the provision of fair outcomes, based on the ﬁndings that emotional activity
does result from unfair outcomes. Along this line, recent theoretical work on managerial rule adherence by Scott, Colquitt, and Paddock (2009) provides one template that could be used to design

<-----Page 10----->150

J.H. Dulebohn et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 140–151

behavioral experiments where organizational variables (such as
managerial discretion or time pressure) are manipulated and employee emotional responses and behavioral reactions to differing
levels of managerial rule adherence are subsequently measured.
Our results could also have implications for how strategic decisions made by top management are perceived. Corporate managers
deal with a range of strategic reallocation decisions, such as those
that occur after acquisitions. Our ﬁndings suggest that these agents
need to make an effort to ensure and convey that adherence to procedural justice rules is occurring in order to mitigate misperceptions leading to negative cognitive reactions. For example, when
communicating about the process being used to determine how
the acquired ﬁrm will be integrated into the acquiring organization, our results suggest that managers should be clear about
how the process being implemented matches the cultural norms
of the organization and is consistent with earlier communications
from corporate management. However, when communicating who
will gain and lose either power or their employment as part of the
integration process, managers need to be much more focused on
the emotional content of the communication and prepare for dealing with emotional reactions to the decision. Distributive and procedural fairness have been shown to have effects on employee
attitudes and positive organizational outcomes such as performance, motivation, and citizenship behaviors, as well as negative
outcomes including sabotage, absenteeism, and theft. In addition,
important topics in the organizational sciences such as stress, employee selection and training, discrimination, and dispute resolution have been linked to one or both forms of justice (for a
review of many of these topics, see Greenberg & Colquitt, 2005).
The results of this study support the need to be cognizant of the
separate and distinct neural activation that occurs during evaluations of procedural and distributive injustice and the need to take
a multidimensional rather than unidimensional approach in the
management and application of organizational justice.
