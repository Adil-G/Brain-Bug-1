This study examined the use of speciﬁc forms of emotion regulation at work, utilizing
Gross’s [Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging ﬁeld of emotion regulation: An integrative review.
Review of General Psychology 2, 271–299] process-based framework of emotion regulation
as a guiding structure. In addition to examining employee self-reported usage of these
emotion regulation strategies, we assessed the types of discrete negative emotions and
negative affective events associated with their use. Results demonstrated that employees
reported using a wide variety of emotion regulation strategies, and that each strategy
tended to align with a distinct set of discrete negative emotions and affective events. These
ﬁndings support expanding the focus of emotion regulation strategies at work beyond the
deep acting (i.e., changing feelings) and surface acting (i.e., changing expressions) distinction. The results also suggest that focusing on speciﬁc strategies, rather than categories of
emotion regulation, could enhance understanding of how employees manage their emotions at work.

In her book, The Managed Heart, Hochschild (1983) formally articulated the idea that employees often get paid for controlling their feelings and emotional expressions, particularly when interacting with customers. Hochschild named this phenomenon emotional labor and identiﬁed two main strategies by which individuals manage their emotional displays: surface
acting and deep acting. Surface acting has been described as ‘‘faking in bad faith” and involves expressing the organizationally-desired emotion and hiding an undesired emotion, whereas deep acting is considered to be ‘‘faking in good faith” as it
involves changing one’s felt emotion so that the emotional expressions naturally match display requirements (Grandey,
2000; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987). Although these emotion regulation strategies predict a variety of individual and organizational
outcomes (e.g., Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002), some researchers have proposed that a broader, more detailed set of emotion
regulation strategies (ERS) may better represent the ways in which individuals manage their emotions at work (e.g., Grandey
& Brauburger, 2002). Guided by this view, we explored the use of several ERS derived from Gross’s (1998) process model of
emotion regulation in the work context. We also examined the negative emotions and events that were associated with the
use of these ERS. Below, we outline our research questions and present a study that examines them.
1. Emotion regulation strategies
Although research on surface acting and deep acting has yielded valuable information (e.g., Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002;
Diefendorff, Croyle, & Gosserand, 2005), emotion regulation is recognized as being more complex and multifaceted than this

distinction would suggest (e.g., Gross, 2002). Gross (1998, 2002) proposed a process-oriented model of emotion regulation
by theorizing that emotions may be regulated by (a) altering the stimulus or perceptions of the stimulus (antecedent-focused regulation), or (b) altering the response to the stimulus (response-focused regulation). Gross (1998) further divided
antecedent-focused emotion regulation into four categories (situation selection, situation modiﬁcation, attentional deployment, and cognitive change), resulting in ﬁve ERS categories.
Situation selection involves choosing to approach or avoid certain stimuli (people, places, or objects) as a way to regulate
felt emotions. For example, employees may choose to avoid people who tell offensive jokes that upset them, or choose to be
around people who make them feel good. Once individuals are in a situation, they may engage in situation modiﬁcation,
which involves changing the situation so as to alter its emotional impact on oneself. For example, an employee who is serving two customers at once may ask a fellow employee to assist one customer so as to prevent the occurrence of negative
emotions that could result from role overload or serving an impatient customer.
Attentional deployment and cognitive change are used after an event has occurred but before a full-blown affective reaction (Gross, 1998). Attentional deployment involves focusing one’s attention away from the emotion-provoking event or target by using techniques such as distraction (i.e., turning attention away from a situation), concentration (i.e., becoming
absorbed in a different activity), or positive refocus (i.e., doing something enjoyable). For example, after a difﬁcult customer
interaction, an employee may think about fun plans for the evening or look at pictures of a family vacation in order to lift his/
her mood. Alternatively, the employee may decide to work on an enjoyable task or a task in which he/she can become absorbed. Cognitive change strategies focus on reappraising or reinterpreting situations so as to modify their subjective meaning, thereby altering the emotional impact of the situation on the person. Cognitive change strategies include techniques
such as perspective taking (e.g., considering how another person feels), cognitive re-framing (e.g., thinking about how a situation could be worse) and reappraisal (i.e., interpreting a situation differently). Hochschild’s (1983) example of an employee thinking of difﬁcult customers as small children needing help is an example of cognitive change. Other examples include
considering a conﬂict situation from the other person’s perspective or re-framing a failure situation as a learning
opportunity.
After individuals experience an emotion, they may attempt to change their emotional displays using response modulation. Response modulation is comprised of two distinct, but related strategies: faking unfelt emotions and concealing felt
emotions. For example, an employee who is angry at a customer may express no emotion so as to conceal what is felt. Alternatively, an employee who is affectively neutral may simulate a smile so as to appear enthusiastic. Individuals also may use
both strategies together, such as when an employee is depressed but covers it with a smile in front of customers (Grandey &
Brauburger, 2002).
Grandey (2000) proposed that deep acting and surface acting are roughly equivalent to antecedent-focused and responsefocused emotion regulation, respectively. However, we see at least two points of departure between the framework proposed
by Gross’s (1998) and that by Hochschild (1983). First, and perhaps most obviously, Gross (1998) argued for four distinct
antecedent-focused ERS, whereas deep acting is characterized as a general strategy in which effort is put forth to change
one’s emotions, rendering the different antecedent-focused strategies as being functionally-equivalent. Second, close examination of the deﬁnitions of deep acting and surface acting reveal that they are laden with motives (e.g., Rafaeli & Sutton,
1987), whereas the ERS in Gross’s (1998) framework are not. Speciﬁcally, deep acting indicates a sincere attempt to meet
the emotional display requirements, whereas surface acting is a cynical attempt to do so. The implication is that anytime
employees fake or suppress emotions they are being cynical and anytime they make an effort to change their feelings they
are being sincere. However, it seems quite reasonable that individuals can use any ERS for a variety of reasons (e.g., individuals can suppress feelings for sincere or cynical reasons).
Although recent theoretical treatments of emotion management at work have incorporated Gross’s (1998) categories of
ERS (e.g., Grandey & Brauburger, 2002), no empirical work has examined strategies from all ﬁve categories in a work context.
In the present study, we examined whether and, to what extent, employees use ERS from Gross’s categories in organizational
settings, as well as the emotions and events associated with their use.

2. Emotion regulation, affective events, and discrete negative emotions
A key issue that we wished to understand is which ERS employees use at work. We identiﬁed two studies that examined
the frequency of use of a large number of ERS (Thayer, Newman, & McClain, 1994; Totterdell & Parkinson, 1999). Thayer et al.
(1994) investigated strategies for handling bad moods in non-work contexts and found large differences in their frequency of
use. Totterdell and Parkinson (1999) found differences in the use of speciﬁc ERS in a sample of teacher trainees. However,
these studies did not assess or compare ERS that are explicitly derived from Gross’s (1998, 2002) ﬁve categories (e.g., no response modulation strategies were examined in either study). As a ﬁrst step in understanding the frequency of use of these
strategies at work, we pursued the following research question.
Research Question 1: Which ERS do employees report using most often?
The second main purpose of this study was to understand the circumstances associated with the use of ERS at work. As
described by Grandey and Brauburger (2002), affective events at work and the emotions experienced by individuals should
be the most proximal determinants of emotion regulation. This basic notion—occurrences at work impact feelings, and these
feelings impact a variety of outcomes—is outlined in detail in Weiss and Cropanzano’s (1996) Affective Events Theory. Recent

<-----Page 2----->500

research at the event-level has revealed links between discrete work events, emotions, and ERS (Basch & Fisher, 2000;
Grandey, Dickter, & Sin, 2004; Grandey, Tam, & Brauburger, 2002; Narayanan, Menon, & Spector, 1999). Although this work
has contributed to our understanding of ERS at work, each study either examined a relatively narrow range of affective
events (e.g., only customer events; Grandey, Dickter, et al., 2004; Grandey, Fisk, Mattila, Jansen, & Sideman, 2004), emotions
(Grandey et al., 2002), or ERS (e.g., Narayanan et al., 1999; Totterdell & Holman, 2003), or did not examine all three sets of
variables simultaneously (Basch & Fisher, 2000).
Consistent with the trend of expanding research on emotion regulation at work beyond customer service situations (e.g.,
Diefendorff & Richard, 2003; Pugliesi, 1999), we considered a wide range of negative events and emotions as potential antecedents of ERS. We focused on negative events and emotions because research shows that ‘‘negative events appear to elicit
more physiological, affective, cognitive, and behavioral activity and prompt more cognitive analysis than neutral or positive
events” (Taylor, 1991; p. 67). This asymmetry effect suggests that negative emotions and circumstances are more likely than
positive emotions to lead people to regulate their emotions. Research on emotional labor indicates that negative customerbased events are common (Hochschild, 1983); however, our sample consisted of individuals from a diverse set of occupations that included, but was not limited to customer service. Thus, it was difﬁcult to predict which events or emotions would
be most common. Given the lack of prior research on work events and ERS and the exploratory nature of our study, we proposed the following, general research questions, instead of speciﬁc hypotheses.
Research Question 2: Which affective events are most often identiﬁed by employees as antecedents of ERS?
Research Question 3: Which negative emotions are most often identiﬁed by employees as antecedents of ERS?
Following Grandey and Brauburger’s (2002) work integrating Affective Events Theory with emotional labor, we explored
whether speciﬁc work situations and negative emotions tended to align with particular ERS. Prior work has shown that response modulation is commonly used in stressful or anger events with customers, perspective taking is associated with low
stress or pleasant customer interactions, and positive refocus is not consistently linked with any particular type of event (e.g.,
Grandey, Dickter, et al., 2004; Grandey, et al., 2002; Grandey, Fisk, et al., 2004; Totterdell & Holman, 2003). Beyond these
ﬁndings, very little is known about how speciﬁc ERS align with affective events and discrete negative emotions. Thayer
et al. (1994) found that the most frequently used ERS were rated by participants and by an independent group of psychotherapists as the most effective strategies for coping with difﬁcult situations. Thus, ﬁnding that a strategy is used most often
in response to a certain circumstance may mean that the strategy is especially useful in that situation. Detecting such alignment between speciﬁc strategies, emotions, and events may aid in the development of more precise theories about ERS at
work, as well as the development of interventions aimed at teaching employees how to manage their emotions at work. We
therefore explored the following research questions.
Research Question 4. Do employees report experiencing different types of events for each ERS?
Research Question 5. Do employees report experiencing different discrete negative emotions for each ERS?

3. Method
3.1. Participants and procedure
Two hundred and sixty employed students at a large southeastern university completed surveys in exchange for extra
credit toward their course grades. Missing or invalid event descriptions (described below) reduced the sample size to
232. The mean age of the ﬁnal sample was 21.4 years, and 78.9% of the sample was female. Participants worked in a variety
of occupations (40% sales/service; 31.7% clerical; 7.3% healthcare; 6.8% education; 5.9% professional/technical; 4.5% skilled
labor; 3.7% other) and an average of 24 hours per week.
Participants completed two surveys. The ﬁrst survey included a list of ERS and asked participants to indicate the extent to
which they had used each strategy in the past 30 days. Such recognition-based response formats have been shown to enhance memory compared to more open-ended, free recall response formats (e.g., ‘‘list the emotion regulation strategies
you use at work”; Tulving, 1983). After completing the ﬁrst survey, participants were given a second survey which listed
the strategies that they had endorsed in the ﬁrst survey and asked them to provide a general, written description of one circumstance that prompted them to use each strategy. This methodology gave participants the freedom to choose the situations they described, enabling them to focus on relatively salient, memorable events. Such a methodology should have
produced reasonably accurate recall, compared to methodologies requiring one to remember very speciﬁc details of events
or events that are not very salient (Tulving, 1983).
3.2. Measures
3.2.1. ERS
As a ﬁrst step in the development of the set of ERS examined in this study, the ﬁrst author and a research assistant reviewed the literature on ERS (e.g., Gross, 1998; Thayer et al., 1994; Totterdell & Parkinson, 1999) and adapted or wrote items
that tapped Gross’s ﬁve categories of emotion regulation at work. We excluded strategies that were deemed unlikely to be
used at work (e.g., exercising, using alcohol or drugs, taking a nap, shopping), resulting in an initial pool of 69 ERS items. As a
second step, these items were given to a group of 7 doctoral students who were studying emotions at work. The students

<-----Page 3----->J.M. Diefendorff et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 73 (2008) 498–508

501

were given deﬁnitions and examples of Gross’s ﬁve dimensions and asked to place each ERS into one of the categories. Items
that were not sorted into the same category by at least 5 of the 7 students were excluded from further consideration. This
process resulted in a set of 21 ERS. In an attempt to reduce the redundancy of item content, we dropped seven additional
items. The ﬁnal set of 14 items (see Table 1) broke down into categories as follows: two situation selection, two situation
modiﬁcation, ﬁve cognitive change, three attentional deployment, and two response modulation strategies. Attentional
deployment was comprised of three sub-strategies (one concentration, one distraction, and one positive re-focus), as was
cognitive change (two re-appraisal, two re-framing, and one perspective taking). Response modulation was comprised of
two sub-strategies (faking and hiding). It is important to note that the procedures described above were not aimed at producing homogeneous scales, but rather at identifying a diverse set of ERS that are representative of the ways people manage
their emotions at work.
Participants ﬁrst completed a survey asking them to respond ‘‘yes” or ‘‘no” as to whether they had used each of 14 ERS at
least once in the previous 30 days. Participants were instructed to respond ‘‘yes” only if they could recall at least one speciﬁc
instance when they had used this strategy in the past 30 days. They also were asked to rate the frequency with which they
used each strategy during the previous 30 days using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = ‘‘almost never”; 7 = ‘‘almost always”). Individuals who indicated that they had not used the strategy during the previous thirty days were assigned a value of 0 on this
scale.
3.2.2. Discrete emotions
On the second survey, participants were asked to think back to a speciﬁc instance of using the strategy and indicate what they
felt just before using the particular strategy by choosing one or more emotions from a list of emotion adjectives. The emotion
adjectives were taken from the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale, or JAWS (Van Katwyk, Fox, Spector, & Kelloway,
2000). We focused on negative emotions in the present study, which were divided into high activation (e.g., angry), moderate
activation (e.g., frustrated), and low activation (e.g., bored) categories, based on the work of Van Katwyk et al. (2000).
3.2.3. Affective events
Also on the second survey, participants were asked to describe the circumstances that preceded their use of each ERS.
These descriptions ranged from a few words to three sentences. Content analysis was used to code each description into

one of 12 categories by the three authors, similar to procedures used in past research (Dasborough, 2006; Keenan & Newton,
1985; Narayanan et al., 1999). The 12 categories used in our study were derived from an initial examination of participants’
written descriptions and past research on affective events (e.g., Basch & Fisher, 2000). Three event categories were interpersonal in nature (interactions with customers, coworkers, and supervisors), and the remaining nine event categories included:
conﬂict between others, making mistakes, experiencing failure, technical problems, personal problems, physical illness/fatigue, high workload, low workload and aversive work conditions.
On several occasions participants indicated in the ﬁrst questionnaire that they had used a strategy in the past 30
days, but on the second questionnaire they either (a) failed to provide a written description of the event or (b) provided
a response that was coded by at least two out of three coders as not describing an event. Rather than describe the actual
event, these descriptions often elaborated on how individuals felt (e.g., ‘‘Feeling stressed”), why they used a strategy
(e.g., ‘‘Helps me ﬁnish the day”), or what they thought about a situation (e.g., ‘‘The day’s not going right”). We dropped
28 participants who provided blank or invalid event descriptions for two-thirds or more of the strategies they reported
using.
Across the remaining 232 individuals, there were 2142 responses where participants reported using a strategy in the prior
30 days. However, 439 (20.5%) of these afﬁrmative responses either did not have an associated event description on the second questionnaire or the description provided was coded as not being an event. Of the remaining 1703 events, 1672 events
were categorized the same by at least two of the three raters (98.1%). The 31 events that were not assigned to the same category by at least two coders were excluded from subsequent analyses. Finally, 21 descriptions reﬂected positive events. We
excluded these from the analyses resulting in a ﬁnal set of 1651 negative event descriptions (7.1 per participant, on average).
The number of event descriptions for each ERS is reported in Table 1. The inter-rater reliability for coding the event descriptions was evaluated by calculating the average Cohen’s Kappa, which was .71, suggesting reasonable reliability (more detail
on the calculation of Kappa in the present dataset is available from the ﬁrst author).

4. Results
4.1. Emotion regulation strategy use
To answer our ﬁrst research question, we examined the number of individuals who reported using each strategy at least
once in the past 30 days and the frequency of reported use during that time period. Across the 232 participants, individuals
reported using strategies in 2142 instances, or about 9.2 strategies per person (see Table 1) out of 14 possible. Differences in
the frequency of reported ERS use were examined with a one-way repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc comparisons with
Bonferroni corrections. This test yielded a signiﬁcant overall effect, F(13, 3003) = 22.24, p < .001, partial g2 = .088, suggesting
that participants reported using the strategies at different rates. The most frequent strategy was ‘‘seek out individuals that
make me feel good,” followed by ‘‘keep myself busy working on other things,” ‘‘do something enjoyable to improve my
mood,” and ‘‘try to solve the problem,” all of which were reported as being used approximately ‘‘sometimes” during the previous 30 days, on average (see Table 1). The strategies reported as being used least often were ‘‘remove myself from the situation,” and ‘‘avoid a situation that I know will make me feel bad,” both of which were reported as being used approximately
‘‘rarely,” on average. Other differences between strategies can be seen in Table 1.
4.2. Frequency of affective events and felt emotions
Nonparametric statistics were used to examine the frequency of reported events and negative emotions. Across the 1651
event descriptions, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the reporting of the major categories of affective events (Friedman
Test v2 [9, N = 232] = 231.06, p < .05). The Friedman Test is used to analyze repeated measurements of categorical data—in
this case, the frequency of reported events, across the 14 ERS. Consistent with Basch and Fisher (2000), interpersonal situations constituted the largest proportion of affective events (776; 47%) and were distributed across three targets as follows:
customers (349; e.g., an ofﬁce clerk wrote that ‘‘An angry customer walked in and cursed me for having his cable line cut
off”), coworkers (273; e.g., a restaurant hostess wrote ‘‘When waiters don’t pre-bus, I have to go back behind them and clean,
even though it’s not my job and I have a line of customers at the door”), and managers (154; e.g., a retail salesperson wrote ‘‘I
felt my manager was being unfair in the distribution of duties”). Finding that customer events were the most common type
of event is consistent with the emotional labor literature (Grandey, 2000).
Five hundred and eighty-three (35.3%) events were distributed across work context and content situations, the most common of which was experiencing aversive work (163; e.g., a housekeeper wrote ‘‘I had just cleaned out a washer that had torn
pieces of a rug in it [like hundreds of pieces]”), followed by making mistakes or experiencing failure (142; e.g., a receptionist
wrote ‘‘I made a mistake and gave out a key when I shouldn’t have”). Workload issues, such as too little work (101; e.g., a
waitress wrote ‘‘(the) restaurant was slow and I had nothing to do”) and too much work (82; a waitress wrote ‘‘[I had] 4
tables all at once”), were next most common. Technical problems (51; e.g., a sales associate wrote ‘‘one of two computers
crashed”) and conﬂict between others (44; e.g., an ofﬁce clerk wrote ‘‘employees (were) ﬁghting over nothing”) made up
the remaining work-related affective events. The last major category of affective events pertained to non-work factors
involving personal or physical problems (286; e.g., a receptionist wrote ‘‘[I had] an argument with my spouse”). Comparing

all event categories, this is the second largest category behind customer events. This event category is interesting because it
suggests that the emotions that need to be regulated at work may not originate in workplace circumstances.
Across the 1651 event descriptions, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the reporting of negative emotions (Friedman
Test, v2 [14, N = 232] = 698.10, p < .05), with the most frequently referenced negative emotions being annoyed (374), frustrated (328) angry (221), bored (173), discouraged (172), and fatigued (162). The least commonly referenced negative emotions were frightened (16), intimidated (43), miserable (63), and furious (67). ‘‘Pure” emotional reactions, in which only one
negative emotion was referenced in the event descriptions, occurred 72.9% of the time. The remaining event descriptions
referenced a ‘‘blend” of negative emotions, with 17.9% of descriptions having two emotions and 9.2% having three or more
emotions. Most ERS had similar levels of emotional blends, with the exceptions being that higher blends were observed for
the attentional deployment strategy ‘‘do something enjoyable to improve my mood,” (found in 39.1% of responses), followed
by the two response modulation strategies, ‘‘pretend that I am in a good mood” (35.6%) and ‘‘hide how I really feel” (35.8%).
4.3. Co-occurrence of ERS, emotions and events
The last two research questions pertained to the co-occurrence of reported ERS use with affective events and discrete
emotions (see the frequencies in Tables 2 and 3). Although nearly every affective event category and emotion was reported
for each ERS, differences in the rates of reported affective events and felt emotions for each ERS were observed (see the chisquare tests in Tables 2 and 3). We review some of these ﬁndings below.
4.3.1. Situation selection
As shown in Table 2, the strategy ‘‘avoid a situation that I know will make me feel bad” was most commonly associated
with coworker events and customer events. The strategy ‘‘seek out individuals that make me feel good” was most closely tied
to personal/physical problems followed closely by coworker events. As shown in Table 3, feeling annoyed was the most common emotion for both of these ERS.
4.3.2. Situation modiﬁcation
As shown in Table 2, the strategy ‘‘remove myself from the situation” was most commonly linked to customer events followed by coworker events. Table 3 shows that the emotions of frustration and annoyance were most common for this ERS.
The strategy ‘‘try to solve the problem” was most commonly tied to mistake/failure events and feeling confused and frustrated (see Tables 2 and 3).
4.3.3. Attentional deployment
The positive refocus strategy, ‘‘do something enjoyable to improve my mood,” was most frequently tied to personal/physical problems, whereas the concentration strategy, ‘‘keep myself busy working on other things,” was most often linked to low
workload; both strategies were most often associated with boredom (see Tables 2 and 3). The distraction strategy ‘‘turn my
attention to something that doesn’t bother me” was most often tied to coworker and customer events and the emotion of
annoyance (see Tables 2 and 3).
4.3.4. Cognitive change
The two reappraisal strategies, ‘‘reinterpret the situation in a more positive light” and ‘‘ﬁnd humor in the situation,” were
most often linked to customer events and feeling annoyed (see Tables 2 and 3). The perspective-taking strategy, ‘‘think about
how the other person feels,” also was tied to customer events and several emotions, including annoyance, confusion, anger
and frustration. Similarly, the cognitive re-framing strategy, ‘‘remind myself that I can’t control everything,” was most closely linked to customer events and feeling frustrated. In contrast, the cognitive re-framing strategy, ‘‘consider how things
could be worse,” was most frequently linked to aversive work. Like the other cognitive change strategies, however, it was
most often linked to feeling frustrated (see Tables 2 and 3).
4.3.5. Response modulation
The faking strategy, ‘‘pretend that I am in a good mood,” was most closely tied to personal/physical problems and feelings
of fatigue. The suppression strategy, ‘‘hide how I really feel,” was most closely tied to interactions with customers and personal/physical problems. This strategy was most commonly associated with feelings of anger and annoyance (see Tables 2
and 3).

5. Discussion
This study demonstrated that each of the 14 ERS were reported as being used at work in the previous 30 days by 46–75%
of employees, suggesting that the ERS derived from Gross’s (1998) model are indeed used at work. However, it also is true
that differences were observed between ERS, even between strategies belonging to the same category. For example, the most
commonly reported strategies came from different categories in Gross’s model, including attentional deployment (‘‘keep myself busy working on other things,” ‘‘do something enjoyable to improve my mood”), situation selection (‘‘seek out individ-

uals that make me feel good”), and situation modiﬁcation (‘‘try to solve the problem”). Interestingly, these strategies do share
a common theme of being active approaches to coping with difﬁcult situations and negative emotions (Roth & Cohen, 1986).
The two least commonly reported strategies involved situation modiﬁcation (‘‘remove myself from the situation”) and situation selection (‘‘avoid a situation that I know will make me feel bad”). Although these strategies also are from different
categories in Gross’s (1998) model, they share a passive, avoidance-oriented approach to dealing with difﬁcult situations
and negative emotions (Roth & Cohen, 1986). It may be that avoidance-based ERS are not appropriate or useful at work, compared to more proactive, approach-oriented ERS. Perhaps the approach and avoidance distinction could serve as an organizing framework in future research on ERS at work (Roth & Cohen, 1986).
It also is noteworthy that the cognitive change and response modulation strategies, which have been argued as being
most similar to deep acting and surface acting, respectively (Grandey, 2000; Grandey et al., 2004), were reported as being

used at intermediate levels of frequency. In contrast to the assumption that surface acting and deep acting adequately describe the ways in which individuals manage their emotions at work, these ﬁndings indicate that these strategies were not
even the most commonly reported strategies among our participants. One possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that we did
not restrict our focus to customer service jobs, as does much of the emotional labor research (Grandey, 2000). Indeed, customer-related events were the most common type of event for ﬁve of the seven cognitive change and response modulation
strategies. However, the fact that other strategies were used at a higher frequency overall and in response to non-customer
circumstances suggests that focusing on a broader set of strategies may have beneﬁts.
Another key result from our study is that, similar to Basch and Fisher (2000), we found that the work events most commonly reported as triggering emotion regulation were of an interpersonal nature, with customer events being the most common among them. Interestingly, the second most commonly reported event category involved the experience of personal/
physical problems that individuals brought to work with them. This ﬁnding coincides with prior research suggesting that
non-work events can ‘‘spill over” to impact individuals at work (e.g., Judge, Ilies, & Scott, 2006). However, the notion that
non-work events contribute to emotion regulation at work has not been widely recognized. Perhaps interventions designed
to help employees cope with negative emotions might beneﬁt from the inclusion of methods for dealing with personal problems that they bring to the job. We also found that several non-interpersonal work events (e.g., aversive work, high workload, low workload) were linked to the reported use of ERS. Such work content factors also are rarely examined in research
on emotion regulation at work.
A third key ﬁnding was that the most frequently reported emotions in ERS situations were annoyance and frustration,
followed by anger. As a whole, moderate activation negative emotions (933) were reported most often, followed by low activation negative emotions (746). High activation negative emotions (546) were the least often reported category of emotions,
with anger accounting for over 40% of these occurrences. Such a ﬁnding suggests that high activation negative emotions
either do not occur often at work, or they occur but are not regulated. Although we cannot rule out either explanation,
the latter explanation seems unlikely given Taylor’s (1991) conclusion that people are naturally inclined to dampen the effects of negative emotions. While we believe that research on high activation negative emotions should continue, our results
suggest that more attention should be given to moderate and low activation negative emotions in organizational research. A
ﬁnal point with regard to the emotions ﬁndings is that emotional blends were fairly common in our data, suggesting that
complex emotional reactions play a role in emotion regulation at work.
5.1. Do emotions and affective events differ for different ERS?
The results demonstrated that the circumstances most frequently leading people to use each ERS were quite varied. Particularly illustrative are the comparisons between ERS belonging to the same category. For instance, although the attentional
deployment strategies of ‘‘keep myself busy working on other things” and ‘‘do something enjoyable to improve my mood”
were used particularly often for combating boredom, the nature of the events differed, with the former being used in response to personal/physical problems, and the latter being used in response to low workload. The third attentional focus
strategy, ‘‘turn my attention to something that doesn’t bother me,” occurred most often in response to feeling annoyed
and interacting with coworkers and customers. While all three strategies involve turning one’s attention away from a difﬁcult circumstance, they were linked most often to different types of situations.
Similar differences were observed for the response modulation strategies of ‘‘pretend I am in a good mood” and ‘‘hide how
I really feel.” Both were used most often in response to personal/physical problems (with ‘‘hide. . .” also being commonly
linked with customer events), although their most frequent emotions were different, with the low activation emotion of fatigue being most common for ‘‘pretending” and the high activation emotion of anger being most common for ‘‘hiding.”
Reﬂecting a similar pattern of diversity in antecedent events and emotions, the four situation selection and situation modiﬁcation strategies were used most often in response to four affective events and three discrete emotions (see Tables 2 and
3).
The ERS category exhibiting the highest level of consistency for antecedent events and emotions was cognitive change.
Four out of ﬁve of these strategies were used most often in response to customer interactions and feeling annoyed or frustrated (see Tables 2 and 3). This ﬁnding is consistent with Grandey and Brauburger’s (2002) idea that employees may be best
able to use cognitive strategies for dealing with emotions in service situations. However, the overall trend showed that the
antecedent conditions were quite varied for ERS, even for those strategies belonging to the same conceptual category. This
general lack of consistency suggests that future research might beneﬁt from examining speciﬁc ERS, rather than categories of
strategies (see Axtell, Parker, Holman, & Totterdell, 2007 for an example of this approach).
5.2. Limitations
A few limitations of this study should be noted. First, participants’ retrospective reports may have been biased by memory
problems or transient features of the assessment situation, such as current mood (e.g., Fiedler, Nickel, Muehlfriedel, &
Unkelbach, 2001). In addition to not being capable of accurately responding, some participants may not have been willing
to accurately respond. However, because responses were anonymous and participants were asked to recall the main elements of self-identiﬁed situations (e.g., ‘‘what happened and how did you feel?”), rather than speciﬁc or extraneous details
(e.g., ‘‘what color was your shirt?”; ‘‘what was the date?”), we believe that the information provided should have been

<-----Page 9----->J.M. Diefendorff et al. / Journal of Vocational Behavior 73 (2008) 498–508

507

reasonably accurate (Tulving, 1983). The fact that approximately 80% of the event descriptions were categorizable suggests
that the responses were typically of reasonable quality. However, we recommend that future research use techniques such
as experience sampling to better assess ERS and events.
A second limitation was that we studied young, part-time workers, which may limit the generalizability of the ﬁndings.
However, part-time employees make up an important segment of the workforce (Tilly, 1991); thus, understanding their
experiences and how they cope with them is important. A third limitation of our study was that we examined a relatively
small number of ERS. Indeed, a recent study by Skinner, Edge, Altman, and Sherwood (2003) identiﬁed 400 strategies that
people can use to manage their emotions in difﬁcult situations. However, our goal was not to comprehensively assess
ERS, but rather to examine in detail a representative set of strategies from Gross’s (1998) framework. We encourage future
research to examine more ERS at work, including additional adaptive strategies such as exercise (Stein, 2001) as well as maladaptive strategies such as alcohol/drug use (Bennett & Robinson, 2000).
5.3. Future research
A next step in understanding ERS at work is to develop reliable, valid, multi-item measures of ERS dimensions, derived
either from Gross’s (1998) model or from other frameworks (e.g., Skinner et al., 2003). One way of organizing ERS in work
contexts may be to divide them into approach and avoidance strategies (Roth & Cohen, 1986). Our ﬁndings suggest that individuals reported using approach strategies at work much more often than using avoidance strategies. Another way to organize ERS could be to distinguish between emotion-focused and problem-focused strategies (Folkman & Lazarus, 1980). A
third option would be to combine the two previously mentioned frameworks, resulting in four ERS categories: emotion
engagement, problem engagement, emotion disengagement, and problem disengagement (Tobin, Holroyd, Reynolds, &
Wigal, 1989).
Future research also should directly assess the effectiveness of each of these ERS using a variety of indicators, including
mood repair, emotional display, well-being, customer service, and teamwork. Although Thayer et al. (1994) reported that the
most frequently used strategies were also rated by participants and by psychotherapists as being the most effective for
changing moods, it would be useful to know if these particular ERS are effective for organizational outcomes such as burnout,
job performance, and customer satisfaction. It may even be the case that certain strategies are beneﬁcial for some outcomes
(e.g., well-being) but harmful for others (e.g., customer service). Thus, taking a multi-dimensional approach to deﬁning and
measuring effectiveness of ERS may be important. Future research could help to clarify under what conditions particular ERS
are used at work and the effects these strategies have on outcomes.
