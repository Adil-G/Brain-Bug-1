The objective of this article is twofold. The first is to incorporate mental
accounting, loss-aversion, asymmetric risk-taking behaviour and probability weighting in a multi-period portfolio optimization for individual
investors. While these behavioural biases have previously been identified in
the literature, their overall impact during the determination of optimal
asset allocation in a multi-period analysis is still missing. The second
objective is to account for the estimation risk in the analysis. Considering
26 daily index stock data over the period from 1995 to 2007, we empirically
evaluate our model (Behaviour Resample Adjusted Technique – BRATE)
against the traditional Markowitz model.

In a standard asset allocation procedure, once the risk
tolerance, constraints and financial goals are set, the
output is given by a mean-variance optimization
(Markowitz, 1952; Feldman and Reisman, 2003).
Unfortunately this procedure is likely to fail for
individuals, who are susceptible to behavioural biases.
For instance, in response to short-term market
movements and to the detriment of the long-term
investment plan, the individual investor may require
his asset allocation to be changed. Fernandes et al.
(2007, 2008a) suggest that early liquidation of a longterm investment may be the cause of momentum.
In terms of emotional biases, several empirical
studies (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) have shown

that, when dealing with gains, agents are risk-averse,
but when choices involve losses, agents are riskseeking
(asymmetric
risk-taking
behaviour).
Moreover, in a wide variety of domains, people are
significantly more averse to losses than they are
attracted to same-sized gains. Loss-aversion (Schmidt
and Zank, 2005) is a relevant psychological concept
that has been imported to financial and economic
analysis, and it represents the foundation of prospect
theory.
The current paradigm of individual behaviour in
finance theory is based on expected utility maximization and risk-aversion, which has been under attack
in recent years due to its descriptive inaccuracy.

Experimental psychologists have demonstrated that
people systematically deviate from the choice predictions the classical paradigm implies as individuals are
typically biased.
Behavioural biases can roughly be grouped in two
categories: cognitive and emotional, though both
types yield irrational decisions. Because cognitive
biases (heuristics like anchoring, availability, and
representative biases) stem from faulty reasoning,
better information and advice can often correct
them. Conversely, emotional biases, such as regret
and loss-aversion, originate from impulsive feelings
or intuition, rather than conscious reasoning, and
are hardly possible to correct. Lo et al. (2005)
investigated several possible links between psychological factors and trading performance, finding that
subjects whose emotional reaction to monetary gains
and losses was more intense on both the positive
and negative side exhibited significantly worse
trading performance.
Shefrin (2005) posits that the portfolios selected by
investors whose choices conform to prospect theory
will differ in key aspects from the portfolios selected
by investors whose choices conform to expected
utility theory. The general character of behavioural
portfolios is that they feature a combination of
securities that are very safe with securities that are
very risky, with the overall portfolio failing to be well
diversified. In this sense, an optimal solution to the
asset allocation problem should guide investors to
make decisions that serve their best interest. This
could be the recommendation of an asset allocation
that suits the investor’s natural psychological preferences (emotional biases), even though it may not
maximize expected return for a given level of risk.
More simply, a client’s best practical allocation may
be a slightly under-performing long-term investment
programme to which the investor can comfortably
adhere. From a mean-variance optimization perspective, behavioural investors select portfolios that are
stochastically dominated. This does not mean that the
individual investors are irrational in any sense: it is
not irrational for people to anticipate emotional
reactions and take them into account when making
decisions that try to adjust their choices to their
preferences. However, portfolio managers lack the
guidelines necessary for incorporating these biases
during the process of determining asset allocation.
We address this issue by evaluating whether managers
should moderate the way clients naturally behave to
counteract the effects of behavioural biases so that
they can fit a pre-determined asset allocation or they
1

J. L. B. Fernandes et al.
should create an asset allocation that adapt to clients’
biases, so that clients can comfortable adhere to
the fund.
In general terms, prospect theory and its latter
version cumulative prospect theory1 (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) posits
four novel concepts in the framework of individuals’
risk preferences. First, investors evaluate assets
according to gains and losses and not according to
final wealth (mental accounting). Second, individuals
are more averse to losses than they are attracted to
gains (loss-aversion). Third, individuals are riskseeking in the domain of losses and risk-averse in
the domain of gains (asymmetric risk preference).
Finally, individuals evaluate extreme probabilities in
a way that overestimates low probabilities and
underestimates high probabilities (probability weighting function). This study, as far as we know, is the
first to consider all those aspects in the framework of
portfolio choice.
There are conflicting results in the finance literature on how prior outcomes affect the risk-taking
behaviour of investors in subsequent periods. Lossaversion would predict that traders with profitable
mornings would reduce their exposure to afternoon
risk, trying to avoid losses and thus guaranteeing the
previous gains (Weber and Zuchel, 2005). Odean
(1998) and Weber and Camerer (1998) have shown
that investors are more willing to sell stocks that
trade above the purchase price (winners) than stocks
that trade below purchase price (losers) – a phenomenon termed the disposition effect (Shefrin and
Statman, 1985). Both works interpreted this behaviour as evidence of decreased risk-aversion after a
loss, and increased risk-aversion after a gain. The
standard explanation for the previous behaviour is
based on prospect theory, and particularly on the fact
that individuals are risk-seeking in the domain of
losses and risk-averse in the domain of gains
(asymmetric risk preference).
However, another stream of the literature found
the opposite behaviour. Thaler and Johnson (1990)
name the house-money effect, the behaviour of
increasing risk appetite after a gain. Barberis et al.
(2001) present a model where investors are less lossaverse after a gain while they become more lossaverse after prior losses. Our proposed model
addresses and clarifies the previous contradiction
between house-money and disposition effect.
Despite the vast literature confirming the behavioural biases associated with prospect theory, the
consideration of all those biases in an asset allocation

Tversky and Kahneman’s Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) (1992) combines the concepts of loss-aversion and a nonlinear
rank dependent weighting of probability assessments.

Behaviour finance and estimation risk in stochastic portfolio optimization
framework is still missing. Barberis and Huang (2001)
and Barberis et al. (2001) use loss-aversion and
mental accounting (Thaler, 1999) to explain aspects
of stock price behaviour, but do not employ the full
prospect theory framework and do not examine
optimal asset allocation. Benartzi and Thaler (1995)
consider prospect theory to solve the equity premium
puzzle when investors are loss-averse and evaluate
their portfolios myopically with a horizon of
approximately 1 year. They also suggest an optimal
allocation in equities from 30% to 55%. Magi (2005)
uses behavioural preferences to numerically solve a
simple model of international portfolio choice,
providing a possible explanation for the equity
home bias puzzle, the tendency of individual investors
to prefer its home-country stocks despite the greater
performance of foreign stocks.
Davies and Satchell (2004) provide a solution for
the optimal equity allocation, and explore more
thoroughly the cumulative prospect theory parameter
space that is consistent with observed equity allocations given a financial market’s returns distributions
over a one-month horizon. Shefrin (2005) considers
heterogeneous investors to see the impact of behavioural concepts in the framework of asset pricing.
The first main goal of this study is to incorporate
mental accounting, loss-aversion, asymmetric risktaking, disposition effect and probability weighting in
portfolio optimization in a multi-period setting for
individual investors. We provide a solution for the
asset allocation problem, taking into account all
behavioural biases associated with prospect theory
and using a utility function (suggested in Giorgi et al.,
2004) consistent with both the experimental results of
Tversky and Kahneman, and also with the existence
of equilibrium. We also shed more light on the issue
of how prior outcomes affect subsequent risk-taking
behaviour, investigating the investor’s risk-taking
behaviour following a rise, or a fall, in the price of
the risky asset.
In line with prospect theory, investors derive utility
from fluctuations in the value of their final wealth. In
our framework, there is a financial market on which
two assets are traded. A riskless asset, also called a
bond, and a risky asset, also called a stock (under the
assumption of normally distributed returns for the
risky asset). As we are modelling the decision-making
process of an individual investor, short selling is not
allowed. In each period (we consider two periods), the
investor chooses the weight of his endowment to be
invested in the risky asset, in order to maximize his
utility (prospect theory based). We assume that the
investor acts myopically in a sense that he does not
discount long-term welfare when evaluating his
utility, and that the reference point relative to which

721

he measures his gains and losses for the first period is
his initial endowment. Although all agents solve the
same maximization problem in the first period, the
second period decision depends on the reference point
relative to which the agent measures the second
period outcomes (gains or losses). We consider two
possible reference points: the initial wealth or the
current wealth, and analyse both cases. St-Amour
(2006) evaluates household portfolios and his results
reveal that references are strongly relevant and statedependent.
Another well-known issue in asset allocation
problems, using Markowitz optimization, is that the
output is strongly driven by the risk/return estimation, which usually generates very unstable portfolios.
The most famous problem with this technique is the
substitution problem, where two assets with the same
risk but slightly different expected returns. The
optimizer would give all the weight to the asset with
the higher expected return, leading to a very unstable
asset allocation. The second goal of this chapter is to
incorporate estimation risk in the portfolio allocation
behavioural problem.
Recent literature has tried to overcome the
previous problem of leading to unfeasible portfolios.
The main focus of those models is to find out how to
create realistic portfolios considering that the values
used for risk and return are not deterministic but
instead just estimates (they are stochastic). It should
be noted that the misspecification of expected returns
is much more critical than that of variances (Zimmer
and Niederhauser, 2003).
Jorion (1986) offers a simple empirical Bayes
estimator that should outperform the sample mean
in the context of a portfolio. His main idea is to select
an estimator with average minimizing properties
relative to the loss function (the loss due to estimation
risk). Instead of the sample mean, an estimator
obtained by ‘shrinking’ the means towards a common
value is proposed (the average return for the
minimum variance portfolio), which should lead to
decreased estimation error. Similar to Jorion, Kempf
et al. (2002) assumes that the prior mean is identical
across all risky assets. However, Kempf ’s model
considers estimation risk as a second source of risk,
determined by the heterogeneity of the market and
given by the SD of the expected returns across risky
assets.
Black and Litterman (1992) postulate that the
consideration of the global Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) equilibrium can significantly improve
the usefulness of asset allocation models, as it can
provide a neutral starting point for estimating the set
of expected excess returns required to drive the
portfolio optimization process. Horst et al. (2002)

722
propose a new adjustment in mean-variance portfolio
weights to incorporate the estimation risk. The
adjustment amounts to using a pseudo risk-aversion,
rather than the actual risk-aversion, which depends on
the sample size, the number of assets in the portfolio
and the curvature of the mean-variance frontier. The
pseudo risk-aversion is always higher than the actual
one and this difference increases with the uncertainty
in the expected return estimations. Maenhout (2004)
also considers an adjustment in the coefficient of riskaversion to insure the investor against some endogenous worst case.
Finally, Michaud (1998) suggests portfolio sampling as a way to allow an analyst to visualize the
estimation error in traditional portfolio optimization
methods, and Sherer (2002) posits that sampling from
a multivariate normal distribution (a parametric
method termed Monte Carlo simulation) is a way to
capture the estimation error. Markowitz and Usmen
(2003) compared the traditional approach to resampling and their results support the latter. Fernandes
et al. (2008b) evaluate several asset allocation models
and suggest that resampling methods typically offer
the best results.
This study presents a novel approach (Behavioral
Resample Adjusted Technique – BRATE) to incorporate behavioural biases and estimation risk into
mean-variance portfolio selection. In a paper close to
ours, Vlcek (2006) proposes a model to evaluate
portfolio choice with loss-aversion, asymmetric risktaking behaviour and segregation of riskless opportunities. His findings suggest that the changes in
portfolio weights crucially depend on the reference
point and the ratio between the reference point and the
current wealth, and thus indirectly on the performance
of the risky asset. Our work differs from his study as
we explicitly consider all novel aspects of prospect
theory: mental accounting, loss-aversion, asymmetric
risk-taking behaviour and probability weighting
function. We also evaluate the inefficiency cost of
the behavioural biases and consider a more general
form for the risky asset return process, including
estimation risk in the analysis.
Considering daily equity data from the period
from 1995 to 2007, we empirically evaluate our
model in comparison to the traditional Markowitz
model. Our results support the use of BRATE as an
alternative for defining optimal asset allocation and
posit that a portfolio optimization model may be
adapted to the individual biases implied in prospect
theory.
The remainder of this article contains the following
sections. Section I discusses the behavioural biases
considered and describes our model proposing the
BRATE. Section II presents the empirical study,

describing the data and implementation, and providing the results. Section III concludes the research by
reviewing the main achievements.

I. The Behavioural Model
We present a two period’s model for portfolio choice
in a stylized financial market with only two assets,
where the investor’s preferences are described by
cumulative prospect theory as suggested by
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Tversky and
Kahneman (1992). In our framework, there is a
financial market in which two assets are traded: a
riskless asset, also called the bond, and a risky asset,
the stock. Let us consider the return of the stock in
each period given by the following process: R ¼
 þ sn, with n  N(0, 1). The riskfree bond yields a
sure return of Rf. We assume that the time value of
the money is positive, i.e. that interest rates are nonnegative.
The preferences of the investor are based on
changes in wealth and are described by prospect
theory. We assume that he owns an initial endowment, W0 (normalized to 1 monetary unit), and that he
earns no other income. The agent invests a proportion
 of his wealth in the stock and (1  ) in the bond.
Since we want to model the individual investor’s
behaviour, we assume that short selling is not allowed
(0    l). We also assume that the investor acts
myopically, and the reference point relative to which
he measures his gains and losses in the first period is
his initial wealth. Then, the perceived gain or loss in
the end of the first period is given by

As pointed out in Vlcek (2006) the choice process
under prospect theory starts with the editing phase,
followed by the evaluation of edited prospects and
finally the alternative with the highest value is chosen.
During the editing phase, agents discriminate gains
and losses. They also perform additional mental
adjustments in the original probability function
 ¼ f(x), defining the probability weighting function
(p). Based on experimental evidence, individuals
adjust the likelihood of outcomes such that small
probabilities are overweighted and large probabilities
are underweighted. We will consider the probability
weighting function, as in Giorgi et al. (2004) given by

4þ40 makes the value function steeper in the
negative side (loss-aversion), and x is the change in
wealth or welfare, rather than final states (mental
accounting), as proposed by Kahneman and Tversky
(1979). Also, the value function is concave above the
reference point and convex below it (asymmetric risk
preference). It is useful to consider the previous form
for the value function because of the existence of a
CAPM equilibrium3 and the ability to reach constant
coefficients of risk preference (	). The previous
formulation is also supported by the laboratory
results from Bosch-Domènech and Silvestre (2003).

In our two-period model for portfolio choice, the
investor chooses a weight in the risky asset to
maximize his expected utility (V). His preferences
are based on changes in his wealth (x) and are
described by prospect theory. The total expected
value he addresses to a given choice of  is given by

where v(x) is the prospect value of the outcome x, and
( f(x)) is the weighted cumulative probability associated with that outcome. Prospect theory is a
descriptive theory postulating that, in comparing
alternatives, the investor will choose the alternative
that makes V as high as possible. Let us then evaluate
the investor’s problem in each period.
First period
In the first period, the agent’s problem consists of
defining the allocation of his initial wealth between
the two assets traded in the financial market. He
maximizes his utility in t ¼ 0 by allocating a fraction,
0, of his initial wealth,4 W0, in the risky asset and
(1  0) in the riskfree asset. We consider that the
investor is a myopic optimizer in the sense that he
takes into account only the first period result. For
multi-period horizons, the choices at earlier dates
impact the reference points at later dates. This feature
allows for complex modelling. However, as pointed
out in Shefrin (2005), prospect theory is a theory
about investors who oversimplify, and so, assuming
that individuals are sophisticated enough to perceive
the link between their current choices and future
reference points is something unreasonable. We also
constrain short selling, as it is common for individual
investors’ models. Thus, his problem can be given by

Under CPT with Tversky and Kahneman (1992) specifications, equilibria do not exist as at least one investor can infinitely
increase his utility by infinitely leveraging the market portfolio (the utility index is almost linear for large stakes), while the
security market line theorem holds (Giorgi et al., 2004).

If we were considering a standard utility function,
the optimal allocation in t ¼ 0, for the risky asset
would then be given by
0	 ¼

  Rf
	 2

Let us first consider standard values for the model’s
parameters.7 The riskfree rate equals the historical
annual return of the US three-month Treasury Bill
(T-Bill; Rf ¼ 2.73%). The equity expected return and
volatility equals the historical average of the Morgan
Stanley Capital International (MSCI) global equity
index and its SD ( ¼ 7.61% and  ¼ 12.98%). The
adjustment factor in the probability weighting function equals  ¼ 0.90. The coefficient of risk-aversion
equals 	 ¼ 3. Also, as suggested by Kahneman and
Tversky,  ¼ 2.25 and þ ¼ 1. The individual’s
values (prospect theory and standard) as a function
of the percentage of his wealth invested in the risky
asset are given in Fig. 3. The individual investor is
expected to choose the allocation in the risky asset
which maximizes his expected value.
As can be observed from the graph, using a
standard utility function, the allocation in the risky
asset approaches 100% ( for which the value
function reaches its maximum), while using prospect
theory utility, the investor should allocate 81% of his
wealth in the stock.8 The shapes of the graphs are
different, notably for large allocations in the stock.
The value function using standard utility is equal to
or greater than the one for prospect utility.

The reason for this difference comes from the fact
that in prospect theory, negative outcomes are
penalized more (as are risky portfolios) because
individuals are loss-averse (4þ). In the lossaversion literature evidence suggests that individuals
are around twice more sensitive to losses than they
are attracted to same size gains. For small allocations
in stocks, the prospect of losses becomes less likely
and the value functions tend to coincide.
Related to the effect of probability weighting, if we
set  ¼ 1, thus cancelling out its effect, we reach the
value function as shown in Fig. 4.
Note that the amount optimally invested by the
behavioural investor in the risky asset decreases to
48%, and so probability weighting tends to increase
the risk appetite. Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
suggest that the overweighting of low probabilities
has an ambiguous effect on risk-taking, as it can
induce risk-aversion in the domain of losses, and riskseeking in the domain of gains. In our case, the
overestimation of the extreme positive outcomes
probabilities, shown in Fig. 3, is inducing investors
to take more risk.
However, despite the effects of loss-aversion and
probability weighting, even if we consider  ¼ þ ¼ 1
and  ¼ 1, keeping constant the remaining parameters, the value functions would not coincide, as can
be seen in Fig. 5.
Both models would predict that the investor should
allocate 100% of his endowments in the stock.
However, the value functions are different because,
in prospect theory, individuals are risk-seeking in the

The riskfree rate, the expected return of the risky asset and the volatility of the risky asset were calculated, using daily data,
over the period from 1995 to 2007. The results were annualized.

Davies and Satchell (2004) found that the average proportion in domestic and foreign equities of large pension funds in 1993
was 83% in the UK, which is in line with the prospect theory results.

loss domain (asymmetric risk preference). Thus, they
would be more comfortable in allocating a greater
part of their wealth in the risky asset. The prospect
value function is greater than the standard utility
function.
Observe that the effect of the asymmetric risk
preference goes in the opposite direction of lossaversion and probability weighting. When we diminish the coefficient of risk preference (	 ¼ 0.25) in both
utility functions, we reduce the effect of asymmetry,
and so the value functions are much closer, as can be
seen in the Fig. 6.
The effects of the behavioural biases can thus be
summarized as follows: loss-aversion reduces risktaking, and asymmetric risk-taking behaviour induces
risky attitudes. Probability weighting has an ambiguous effect on risk. Our intuition is that, in the long

run, as the value function parameters are changing,
these biases tend to cancel out, eliminating the
efficiency loss originated by each bias. That is why
we argue that human biases do not need to be
moderated to reach an efficient investment strategy.
The experimental results of Blavatskyy and Pogrebna
(2006) reveal that the effect of loss-aversion is largely
neutralized by the overweighting of small probabilities and underweighting of moderate and high
probabilities.
In order to verify property (i), let us evaluate V
while changing  and keeping constant the other
parameters (considering  ¼ 50%). Figure 7 presents
the graph which indicates that over all positive values
of , the slope of V is positive. The value function is
increasing in . Thus, when the risky asset has a
higher expected return, ceteris paribus implies a
higher value for the investor.
Considering properties (ii) and (iii), let us evaluate
V while changing  and keeping constant the other
parameters (considering  ¼ 50%). Figure 8 presents
the graph indicating that over all positive values of ,
the slope of V is negative, while for  ¼ 0, the slope is
null. When  tends to infinity, the slope tends to null.
The value function is decreasing in s.
The intuition is that, if the volatility of the risky
asset is higher, for the same allocation, this implies a
higher probability of losses reducing the value of the
prospect. In line with traditional rational investor,
behavioural individuals also prefer higher return and
lower risk; mainly because they are risk-averse in the
gain domain and also loss-averse.
Now let us evaluate the values of 0 when we
change the riskfree rate and the expected return of the
risky asset. Since many parameters are involved, it is
not possible to find closed form solutions for 0.
Therefore, we present numerical results for the

As expected, when the risky asset offers more
attractive returns, the agent gradually invests more in
the stock. When the stock is very attractive, the
investor chooses to allocate his entire wealth in the
risky asset. Thus, we observe that 0 is increasing in 
and decreasing in Rf. Also, when Rf is higher, the
changes in 0 due to a variation in  are smoother,
because in these cases losses are less likely and we
approach the standard utility solution. When Rf is
lower, the changes in 0 due to a variation in  are
more abrupt, giving rise to extreme portfolio allocations. If we consider that  is not known with
certainty, the resulting portfolio would be very
unstable. Gomes (2003), in a model with loss-averse
investors, has found that individuals will not hold
stocks unless the equity premium is quite high.

Fig. 10. Expected cost in the first period as function of l
and Rf

We can evaluate the expected cost of inefficiency
related to the behavioural biases associated with the
prospect theory function, for the same parameters
considered in the previous analysis, using
Equation 10. The result is presented in Fig. 10, and
its form is due to the fact that, in standard utility
function, the investor is willing to take more risk than
with the loss-averse prospect utility. The cost is due to
the fact that the expected return of the stock is greater
than the bond, and the standard utility investor is
allocating a greater part of his wealth in the risky
asset than the prospect utility individual. Thus, the
cost is increasing in . However, it is worth noting
that the previous cost is based on expected returns,
which are stochastic in practice. The real cost can just
be observed at the end of the first period with the
realization of the stock’s return.
An important insight can be made from Fig. 10 in
terms of the best practice for asset allocation. As long
as the riskfree rate is lower and the expected return of
the stock is higher, the optimal allocation should
moderate the investor’s biases in order to reach a
better performance. On the other hand, if the risk
premium is lower, the moderation is less relevant, and
the optimal allocation may adapt to the individual’s
biases.
We can also analyse the change in the allocation of
the stock when we vary the loss-aversion in the risktaking behaviour. The result is shown in Fig. 11, for
2554. Observe that, as long as the investor is
much more averse to losses than he is attracted to
gains, the allocation in the risky asset is lower. When
 ¼ 2.25, the allocation in the risky asset corresponds to 81%, as mentioned previously.
Dimmock (2005) has already shown that a higher
level of loss-aversion leads to lower equity exposure,
and heterogeneity in the coefficient of loss-aversion
has the ability to explain puzzling features of household financial behaviour.

Second period
In order to evaluate the second period allocation
choice of the investor, let us keep some parameters
fixed: ( ¼ 12.98, 	 ¼ 3,  ¼ 2.25 and þ ¼ 1). After
the investor has made his first period decision in t ¼ 0,
the state of nature realizes in t ¼ 1, when he is faced
with his second period problem. Again, he must
allocate his wealth in the two possible assets in the
financial market, bond and stock, to maximize his
utility. Let us consider the same normal distribution
for the return of the risky asset. The investor’s wealth
position at t ¼ 2 equals his position in t ¼ 1 plus the
return of his portfolio in the second period.
While all agents solve the same maximization
problem in the first period, in the second period, it
will depend on the reference point to which he
measures his gains and losses (in the framework of
prospect theory). In our model, there are two
candidates for the investor’s reference point at t ¼ 1:
his initial wealth at t ¼ 0 (W0 ¼ 1) or his wealth at the
end of the first period, t ¼ 1 (W1). If he measures his
gains and losses relative to his wealth at t ¼ 1 (his
current wealth), he treats each gain and loss
separately. On the other hand, if he considers his
initial wealth as the reference point, he adds up the
outcomes (gains and losses), that is, he nets his
positions. The previous distinction is relevant in
prospect theory. The value function is concave in the
domain of gains and convex in the loss domain
(asymmetric risk behaviour).
First, let us consider as the investor’s reference
point his current wealth at t ¼ 1. In this case, the
maximization problem he will solve in the second
period is the same as the one for the first period.
Thus, we can state the following proposition.

We can observe that an individual who measures
his gains and losses relative to his current wealth is
actually solving the same maximization problem in
each period. That is why the allocation in the risky
asset might be the same. This is not surprising; as he
is not using past information to update his beliefs
about the assets, his preferences are similarly
unaffected.
Next, let us analyse the investor’s maximization
problem if he evaluates his gains and losses relative to
his initial wealth. If he has an initial wealth position
of W0 ¼ 100 and his wealth rises in the first period to
W1 ¼ 110 and falls in the next period to W2 ¼ 105, he
values his position at t ¼ 2 as a gain of 5, and not as a
gain of 10 followed by a loss of 5.
In the second period, the agent’s problem consists
of defining the allocation of his wealth (W1) between
the two assets traded in the financial market. He
maximizes his utility in t ¼ 1 by allocating a fraction,
1, of his wealth W1 in the risky asset and 1  1 in the
riskless asset. As we did in the first period analysis,
we also constrain short selling.

0 is the amount allocated in the risky asset in the first
period, and R1 is the observed return of the risky asset
in the previous period.
Observe that the value function to be maximized is
close to one of the first period, but with changes in
the parameters B and C, which account for the
previous period outcome (gain or loss). As we are
interested in the investor’s risk-taking behaviour after
realizing a gain or a loss, let us evaluate the values of
1 when we change the total return obtained in the
first period. Recall that the total return from t ¼ 0 to
t ¼ 1 (Rtot1), depends both on his allocation choice in
t ¼ 0 and on the realized return of the risky asset R1.

( ¼ 7.61%,  ¼ 12.98, 	 ¼ 3, W0 ¼ 1,  ¼ 2.25 and
þ ¼ 1). Figure 12 shows the results. Recall that the
optimal allocation in the risky asset for the first
period, considering the previous parameters, is 81%.
Thus, we need to verify whether the allocation
in the stock in the second period is greater or
lower than 81%, indicating greater or lower risk

appetite, respectively. First, observe that, for a total
return in the first period equal to zero (no gains/
losses), the situation replicates the same framework
the investor faced in the first period. Then we reach
the same optimal allocation in the risky asset (for
Rtot1 ¼ 0 implies 1	 ¼ 81%).
Consider the surroundings of the net value
(Rtot1 ¼ 0). If the investor experiences a gain in the
first period, the model predicts that he should
optimally invest less in the risky asset in the second
period. This behaviour prevails up to the point where
the loss-aversion effect is less pronounced. On the
other hand, if a loss is observed in the first period, he
should take more risk in the following period,
allocating a greater part of his wealth in the stock.
This prediction is in line with several experiments,
which have shown that disposition effect dominates
house-money in dynamic settings (Weber and Zuchel,
2005). When the investor experiences a gain in the
first period, he tends to reduce his risk appetite in
order to guarantee the previous outcome. On the
other hand, if he experiences a loss in the first period,
he will increase his bets on stocks, trying to avoid the
previous loss. In the model, the pattern holds for the
whole gain domain; however, in the loss domain, high
losses in the first period induce less risk appetite in the
second period. The intuition is that if the investor is
facing a huge loss, the loss-aversion effect will
dominate the risk-seeking behaviour, inducing a
reduction in the optimal allocation in the stocks.
When we evaluate the expected cost (Equation 10)
of the behavioural inefficiency in the second period as
a function of the return of the risky asset in the first
period (Fig. 13), it is possible to observe that,
depending on the previous outcome, the cost can be

increasing or decreasing. If the value for R1 is such
that it implies a small loss in the first period, the cost
is even negative, which means that the expected
return in the second period under prospect theory is
greater than the one associated with standard utility.
This is related to a greater risk appetite of the
prospect theory individual after a loss, implying a
greater allocation in the stock, which has a greater
expected return. If R1 indicates a gain in the first
period, then the cost is positive once the allocation in
the stock for the standard utility investor is greater
than for the prospect utility individual.
We can conclude that for losses in the first period,
the optimal allocation should adapt to the individual’s biases to reach better performance as the cost
comes out to be negative in this domain. For gains in
the previous outcome, the allocation should moderate
the biases (observe a positive value for the expected
cost). For extreme losses in the first period, the
allocation should also moderate the investor’s biases.
If we accumulate the cost results in periods 1 and 2,
we get the graph represented in Fig. 14. It indicates
that, for a negative stock result in the first period, or
even a slightly positive one, the prospect theory
individual outperforms the standard utility investor.
So the allocation strategy should be adapted to the
individual biases. The previous results should be taken
with care as they refer to expected values. In section
‘Multi-period analysis’, we provide a more robust
comparison, taking into account the performance of
those individuals in an out-of-sample analysis.

wealth as the reference to which he measures his gains/
losses, he will solve the same maximization problem
for each period and the optimal asset allocation is
given as in Proposition 1. In this situation, the agent
acts myopically, just considering the following
period possible gain/loss. In general, this result implies
a smaller stock allocation if compared to a standard
utility investor, generating an expected cost associated
to the prospect theory biases.
On the other hand, if the individual’s reference
point is his initial wealth (or his wealth in some
moment in time t ¼ t1), the allocation is defined as in
Proposition 3, but now considering the previous
outcome as the total return obtained by him from
t ¼ 0 (or from t ¼ t1) to the current time. As discussed
in the two-period model, the allocation in the risky
asset will depend on the previous gains/losses, and
can be greater or smaller than the one chosen by the
standard utility investor. Observe that the standard
utility investor always chooses the same allocation in
the risky asset, no matter what the reference point, as
neither his decisions nor his beliefs are affected by
previous outcomes.
Resampling
In sections ‘First period’, ‘Second period’ and ‘Multiperiod analysis’ we already evaluated the optimal
asset allocation under prospect theory preferences
and considering mental accounting, loss-aversion,
asymmetric risk-taking behaviour and probability
weighting. However, there is still an important issue
in portfolio optimization missing: estimation error.
Up to now, when solving the investor’s problem, we
considered the expected return known with certainty,

Behaviour finance and estimation risk in stochastic portfolio optimization
which is not the case in reality (especially in emerging
markets where the uncertainty is higher). The
assumed return for the risky asset is just an estimate,
and so the real value can be different. This problem is
relevant in any model of portfolio optimization and is
crucial under prospect theory, where for lower values
of the riskfree rate, a slightly increase in the risk
premium of stocks can lead to extreme allocations. If
the real return of the risky asset is lower, the
likelihood of facing a loss is greater and should
significantly reduce the value of that prospect.
In an attempt to overcome this estimation problem,
Michaud (1998) proposed the resampling technique.
Portfolio sampling allows an analyst to visualize the
estimation error in traditional portfolio optimization
methods. Suppose that we estimated both the
variance and the excess return by using N observations. It is important to note that the point estimates
are random variables and so another sample of the
same size from the same distribution would result in
different estimates.
Sherer (2002) suggests that sampling from a multivariate normal distribution (a parametric method
termed Monte Carlo simulation) is a way to capture
the estimation error. In this sense, return and
variance would just be the expected values for a
multivariate normal distribution. If we just consider
two assets, the probability density function for a
multivariate normal distribution would be given by
f ðx, yÞ ¼

!!

By repeating the sampling procedure n times, we get n
new sets of optimization inputs, and then a different
efficient allocation. The resampled weight for a
portfolio would then be given by
Resamp ¼

n
1X
i
n i¼1

The resampled portfolios should reflect a greater
diversification (more assets enter in the solution) than
the classical mean–variance efficient portfolio, and
should also exhibit less sudden shifts (smooth
transitions) in allocations as return requirements
change. Both characteristics are desirable for
investors.
Recent literature has shown unambiguous results
in favour of resampled portfolios in out-of-sample
analysis (Jiao, 2003; Markowitz and Usmen, 2003;
9

731

Pawley, 2005; Wolf, 2006). However, Harvey et al.
(2006), evaluating Bayes versus resampling methods,
posit that the choice of risk-aversion drives the
results. Kohli (2005) concludes that, despite the fact
that there are no conclusive advantages or disadvantages of using resampling as a technique to obtain
better returns, resampled portfolios do seem to offer
higher stability and lower transaction costs, two
crucial features for long-term investors’ choices.
We then propose the BRATE as a novel methodology to define asset allocation, which incorporates
behavioural ideas and resampling techniques into
portfolio optimization, thus adapting to the individual’s preferences. In this case, the optimal asset
allocation should be given by the previous propositions (1 and 2 or 3, depending on the reference point),
but the procedure should be performed several times
for different expected stock returns (given by a
multivariate normal distribution). The final allocation is then given by the expected risky asset
allocation. The procedure can be summarized as
follows.9
Step 1: Estimate variance–covariance and return
from the historical inputs.
Step 2: Resample from inputs (created in Step 1) by
taking n draws from the input distribution. The
number of draws reflects the degree of uncertainty in
the inputs. Calculate new variance–covariance and
return from sampled series. Estimation error will
result in estimations that are different from those
obtained in Step 1.
Step 3: Calculate the optimal allocation for inputs
defined in Step 2, using the appropriate propositions
(1 and 2 or 3, depending on the reference point
considered).
Step 4: After repeating Steps 2 and 3 many times,
calculate average portfolio weights. This is the
BRATE portfolio allocation.
In the next section, we provide an empirical
analysis comparing the BRATE allocation performance to a standard utility allocation.

II. Empirical Study
Data and implementation
Our tests are based considering daily data from 26
countries’ MSCI stock indices and riskfree rates, plus

This methodology is an adaptation of the one proposed in Michaud (1998).

Notes: This table provides descriptive statistics for the sample of world markets. For each market we present, the average risk
free rate, the mean, SD, skewness and kurtosis of stock returns, as well as the Sharpe ratio (annualized values). The values are
presented in the countries currency and also in USD. The risk free rate used to calculate the Sharpe ratio in USD is the
3 month US T-Bill rate for all markets.

the MSCI World Index, for the period from 4 April
1995 to 5 January 2007. Developed countries and
emerging markets (Brazil, Chile, South Africa, South
Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey) were included in
the analysis in order to find generalizable results. The
total return time series are calculated on each
country’s currency and also in US-dollars. Thus, we
are considering both currency hedged and unhedged
investors. Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics
of each market considered, for the whole sample
period.
From the table, we verify a risk premium
associated with the stock market, both considering
the values in each country’s currency and in USD,
with the mean return of stocks being higher than the
one of the corresponding riskfree rate.10
Let us first consider the values in each country’s
currency. The average annualized return of the
10

riskfree rate varied from 0.151% (Japan) to 39.514%
(Turkey), while for the stock index, it ranges from
0.076% (Thailand) to 47.804% (Turkey). The annualized volatility (SD) of the stock market varied from
12.976% (World Index) to 45.171% (Turkey). As
expected, emerging markets tend to be more volatile
than developed markets. While in Brazil,
South Korea, Thailand and Turkey the volatility
was above 30%, in countries, such as the UK and the
USA, its value was close to 16%. In terms of skewness
and kurtosis, usual results appear, indicating that
daily stock index returns are negative skewed and have
excess kurtosis (greater than 3). Finally, Table 1
presents the annualized Sharpe ratio, which was
greater in developed markets (around 0.35) than
emerging markets (0.19). Our results are in line with
previous literature which gives 0.34 as an estimation of
the long-term Sharpe ratio for the US economy.

The only exception is Thailand where the Sharpe ratio is negative (0.109).

Notes: This table presents the Sharpe ratio of the efficient portfolio generated by each estimation model. The
Sharpe ratio is calculated by dividing the excess return observed by the SD.

When we consider the values in USD, say in the
perspective of a US based international investor who
does not currency hedge his investments, we find
similar results. The average daily return in USD is
close to the one in the country’s currency, which is
evidence of the mean reverting aspect of the foreign
exchange market. However, the SD in USD is slightly
greater than the one in the country’s currency, as the
former includes both stock market risk and currency
risk (the volatility of the foreign exchange rate). In
terms of skewness and kurtosis, the previous results
remain. However, now the Sharpe ratios do not
present relevant differences among emerging and
developed markets (for instance it is 0.430 for Brazil
and 0.422 for the USA). Thus it seems that emerging
stock markets are less interesting for domestic
investors than for foreign unhedged investors.
Next we analyse the performance of the following
optimization strategies: an investor with a standard
utility preference (STU); an investor with prospect
utility preference (PTU), with reference point given
by his current wealth; an investor with PTU, with
reference point given by his wealth in the previous
period (CPT); an investor with a standard utility
preference (resampled) (RSTU); an investor with
prospect utility preference, with reference point given
by his current wealth (resampled) (BRATEa); and an
investor with PTU, with reference point given by his
wealth in the previous period (resampled) (BRATEb).
The utility function parameters are fixed (	 ¼ 3,
 ¼ 2.25 and þ ¼ 1). We vary the estimation
period (p) in an out-of-sample analysis. The parameters are estimated using daily return observations
of the past p days. We define the efficient portfolio
and hold it for the next (e) months, then re-estimate
the parameters and adjust the portfolio weights. To
judge the financial performance of the strategies,
11

1 bps ¼ 0.01%.

we compute their average return and empirical
Sharpe ratios.
Results
The Sharpe ratios of the different strategies are
presented in Table 2 for the World Index and for the
total period from 1995 to 2007, considering p ¼ 6
months, 1, 2 and 4 years, and e varying from 2
months to 1 year. We are evaluating the different
strategies for a US based international stock investor.
The riskfree rate considered was the 3 month T-Bill.
In general, we can state that the resampled models
offered better results for a short selling constrained
investor. It is an expected result as resampled models
take into account the estimation risk, generating a
more diversified portfolio which tends to outperform
in out-of-sample studies. The highest Sharpe ratio
was reached by the BRATEb model for an estimation
period of 2 years and evaluation period of 1 year
(0.465). On average resampled models increase the
Sharpe ratio in around 0.10, when compared to the
deterministic ones. Also, while the (R)STU investor
seems to outperform (R)PTU, it does not happen
with (R)CPT.
If we consider just the total return obtained by each
strategy, we find the results presented in Table 3. In
this case, it is possible to infer an inefficiency cost
related to the behavioural investors, who tend to
underperform the results of the standard utility
investor in around 10 bps.11 However if take into
account the increment in risk (a risk adjusted measure
like Shape ratio), the inefficiency disappears.
Based on the previous results, we can state that
resampled models tend to outperform traditional
models. Also, there is no clear advantage of
standard utility investors over behavioural prospect
theory investors at least to the CPT investor.

Notes: This table presents the Sharpe ratio of the efficient portfolio generated considering an estimation period of
1 year and evaluation period of 6 months (in each country’s currency). The Sharpe ratio is calculated by dividing
the excess return observed by the SD.

Levy and Levy (2004) reached a similar result,
positing that the practical differences between prospect theory and traditional mean–variance theory
are minor. In this sense, behavioural biases should
not be moderated, nor should standard models be
adapted to include behavioural biases.
When we take into account each market separately, we find the results presented in Table 4

(in each country’s currency). Considering each
country individually, there’s no clear dominance
of a single strategy. Resampled models tend to
outperform traditional models in emerging markets
(observe the results for Brazil, Chile, South Africa,
South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey), where
the uncertainty over the risk/return estimation is
higher.

Notes: This table presents the Sharpe ratio of the efficient portfolio generated considering an estimation period of
1 year and evaluation period of 6 months (values in USD). The Sharpe ratio is calculated by dividing the excess
return observed by the SD.

In terms of the comparison between the standard
and the prospect utility investor, generally the former
does not outperform the latter, indicating no clear
dominance of the traditional rational model. In this
sense, there is no need for moderating the behavioural
biases as described by prospect theory, as no extra
financial efficiency is gained.
Generally speaking, an interesting finding is the
fact that all previous allocation models outperform
the 100% risky strategy. The Sharpe ratio of the
100% stock strategy was 0.383 while all resampled
models reached, on average, a result above 0.509.12
Finally, if we take into account the values in USD
and so considering that the investor is facing
foreign exchange risk, we reach the results presented
in Table 5.
Again, the results indicate a dominance of
resampled models in emerging markets, while for
developed countries, no clear dominance can be seen.
The traditional rational model does not outperform
the behavioural ones. Finally, all six dynamic models
add value for the investor when compared to a 100%
12

stock invested individual. Observe that the Sharpe
ratio found for the different markets (both in the
country’s currency and in USD) are notably higher
than the ones presented in Table 1.
Summing up, resampled models, which take into
account estimation risk, tend to outperform deterministic models, notably for emerging markets where
the uncertainty of the expected return estimation is
higher. Moreover, prospect theory utility investors do
not reach worse returns if compared to the traditional
rational ones, which indicates no need for addressing
bias moderation in the portfolio allocation.

III. Conclusions
This study had two objectives: first to incorporate
mental accounting, loss-aversion, asymmetric risktaking behaviour and probability weighting in portfolio optimization for individual investors; and second
to take into account the estimation risk in the analysis.

A t-test over the Sharpe ratio differences offered a significant result with a p-value of 0.0001.

Considering daily index stock data from 26
countries over the period from 1995 to 2007, we
empirically evaluated our model (BRATE) against
the traditional Markowitz. Several estimation and
evaluation periods were used and we also considered
a foreign exchange hedged and an unhedged strategy.
Our results support the use of BRATE as an
alternative for defining optimal asset allocation and
posit that a portfolio optimization model may be
adapted to the individual biases implied in prospect
theory. Behavioural biases do not seem to reduce
efficiency when we consider a dynamic setting. This
result is robust for different developed and emerging
markets. Also, the previous optimization models add
value for the individual investor when compared to a
naive 100% risky strategy.
As further extensions of the present research, we
suggest the inclusion of several risky assets in the
analysis. In this case, the issue of multiple mental
accounting is a crucial issue to address the problem.
An investor who evaluates every security in their own
mental account will not necessarily view additional
securities as redundant, which dramatically increases
the complexity of the problem.
We also leave unanswered the question of how
individuals arrive at the underlying return distribution. That is the model above is a proposed
mechanism for how individuals might transform a
given probability distribution (assumed to be an
accurate representation of the underlying distribution) into decision weights. Once we introduce
uncertainty, it can induce individual biases, subjectivity and error. There is evidence that people display
considerable overconfidence when asked to provide
a subjective assessment of a probability distribution.13 Moreover, it is questionable whether the
weightings provided by CPT truly reflect the process
by which individuals evaluate continuous probability
distributions.
Another suggestion is an analysis if the Sharpe
ratio is an appropriate performance measure when
considering behavioural investors. Is the volatility
capturing all the relevant risk for the individual
behavioural investor? The consideration of estimation error in the Sharpe ratio estimation is also left
for a further research.
The agent who measures his gains and losses
always relative to his actual wealth solves the same
maximization problem each period, therefore selecting a fix-mix strategy. An open question remains, if a
fix-mix strategy, where the investor set a fixed
proportion of stocks and bonds for his portfolio,
can be the cause of the disposition effect.
