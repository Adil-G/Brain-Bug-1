Probability of Success in Projects
A series of occasional essays on topics in research and development.
By Daniel P. Johnson

"The following is the opinion of the writer only."
What is the probability of success in doing industrial research? And what is the value of closely
reviewing prospective projects?
The classic study is from The Production and Application of New industrial Technology, by E.
Mansfield, et. al., 1977. It is based on a survey of 16 companies. It divides the research process
into three stagesTechnical Success- Development of a product or service and proof that it works as
desired.
Commercialization- Establishing the production, distribution, and support network for the
product or service.
Financial Success- Making a sufficient profit on the product or service.
The survey showed the following probabilitiesProbability of Technical Success = 0.57
Probability of Commercialization = 0.65
Probability of Financial Success = 0.74
So the overall result isProbability of Technical Success = 0.27
Survey studies such as this have certain methodological problems- hindsight bias, bias due to
differences in evaluation criteria and process between companies, and a low number of samples.
It also doesn't let us look at the value of reviewing projects.
A much more thorough and methodologically interesting study has been conducted by Thomas
Astebro and others, 1997 - 2004 ( see references at end of this essay), based on data from the
Investor's Assessment Program at the Canadian Innovation Centre.
As part of the Investor's Assessment Program, inventors pay $185 for an objective assessment of
their inventions. Over 14,000 have been evaluated since 1979. Experienced assessors evaluate
each project on 37 criteria and present the results to the inventors.
In 1996, Astebro selected a random sample of projects from 1976 - 1993 and conducted a survey
as to the outcome. He received a 76% survey response, which he subjected to extensive
statistical analysis to ensure the absence of biases. Due to a change in criteria, he excluded
1976-1988 and was left with a final sample of 561 projects.
Success in this case was defined as whether the product was ever actually offered for sale.

and also whether it was rated favorably or unfavorably by the evaluation judges.

So this data lets us answer three questionsWhat is the probability of success for a research project?

11%

What is the probability of success for a reviewed research project?

31%

How many potentially successful projects were lost due to review?

24%

Let us compare this with two other well-known sources of hits and failures- Baseball and
Hollywood. First consider Baseball. If we look at the statistics for the National League for the 2003
season, we get the following tale of successprobability of hit per at-bat

27%

probability of home-run per at-bat

3%

This gives us some sense of hope- the probability of a successful project is equivalent to getting
to base safely. We don't have to hit a home run each time.
Looking at DeVany's statistical analysis of Hollywood, we get the following
probability of break-even movie

30%

probability of hit movie (gross profit > $20M)

6%

This is an even closer match: the probability of a successful project is the same as a successful
(break-even) movie.
What is also interesting about these last two sources of numbers is that in their cases, they
represent an inherent risk. They have remained essentially unchanged through decades of
changes. In the case of Hollywood, they have stayed unchanged through decades of
management oversight where people's income and careers have regularly been based on their
ability to predict and generate successes. In spite of all that, the best advice remains William
Goldman's dictate that "nobody knows anything".
So even after review, the chances of a successful research project is as good as that of getting a
base hit, or a successful movie.
