Researchers have only begun to provide explanations of how top executives’ experiences and
perceptions influence organizational decisions. Drawing from a broad theoretical base, this
study tests the contention that top executives’ personal experiences (age, educational background,
and work experience), their perceptions of their firms’ attitudes toward technology and risk,
and their perceptions regarding their firms’ past success with collaborative technological
development influence their cognitive assessments of potential technological alliances. Results
from the study suggest that top executives with a technical education place more weight on
the opportunities provided by the alliance than those with other types of education. Moreover,
executives from firms that are perceived to emphasize technology and to have had success with
technological alliances in the past tend to focus more on the opportunities provided by the
alliance and less on the riskiness of the venture.  1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

As competition becomes more global and the
costs and complexity of technological development increase, firms are establishing networks of
strategic alliances (Hagedoorn, 1993; Pennings
and Harianto, 1992). As the firm’s primary strategists, top executives (i.e., CEO, COO, vice presidents reporting directly to the CEO) as a group
are ultimately responsible for the firm’s cooperative strategies and for selecting alliance partners.
The top executives of a firm can be expected to
enact or construct a shared understanding of the
situation that is used to determine which alliances
are most beneficial to the firm (Daft and Weick,

1984; Walsh, 1995). Research suggests that the
result of this enactment process is dependent on
the cognitive orientations or mental understandings established in the minds of the individual
executives involved (Hambrick and Mason, 1984;
Melone, 1994; Miller, Kets de Vries, and Toulouse, 1982).
Unlike much of the strategic alliance research
reported to date, this study does not focus on the
underlying motivation for establishing alliances,
on how they are structured (e.g., equity vs.
nonequity) or on their success (e.g., Contractor
and Lorange, 1988; Gulati, 1995; Harrigan, 1986;
Hennart, 1988; Kogut, 1988). Nor does it consider the enactment process which takes place
between executives in a firm as they evaluate
cooperative partners or between firms as cooperative relationships emerge, evolve, and dissolve

(e.g., Ring and Van de Ven, 1994). Rather, the
theory presented and tested in this paper considers
the cognitive orientations executives use when
they individually assess technological alliance
opportunities and bring with them when they
talk with other executives about technological
partnering. It considers how top executives’
experiences and perceptions influence their attitudes toward technological alliance formation and
the kinds of information they attend to when
individually assessing potential technological
alliance opportunities.
More specifically, behavioral decision theory is
used to suggest that executives’ cognitive orientations are reflected in (1) their age, educational
background, and work experience; (2) their perceptions of their companies’ emphasis on technology and risk; and (3) their perceptions of
their companies’ success in past technological
collaborative efforts. Hypotheses are proposed
which suggest that these executive experiences
and perceptions directly and indirectly influence
top executives’ assessments of potential technological alliances (see Figure 1). Before
developing and testing the theoretical arguments
supporting this line of reasoning, the theoretical
perspective adopted in the study will be noted and
the definitions of a few terms will be clarified.

STATEMENT OF THEORETICAL
PERSPECTIVE AND DEFINITIONAL
CLARIFICATION
By adopting a cognitive processing perspective,
this study seeks to provide insight on how top
executives’ cognitive orientations, as reflected in
their experiences and perceptions, affect their personal assessments of technological alliance opportunities. It emphasizes the fact that although
executives may try to assess potential technological alliances rationally, their ability to consider
all the information they have is limited (Simon,
1957). Furthermore, how they interpret the information they notice is affected by the cognitive
understandings they have established in their
minds (Starbuck and Milliken, 1988; Walsh,
1988). Thus, the individual top executive, as
a complex information-processing system, is the
study’s focus (March and Simon, 1958). The
limited amount of research on alliances incorporating a cognitive perspective has not gone
unnoticed. Indeed, Auster (1994), in her review
of strategic perspectives on interorganizational
linkages, called for research that incorporates cognitive and learning perspectives. The goal of this
study is to respond to this gap in the literature.
Technology has been defined previously in

many ways (e.g., Cutler, 1989; Harris, Shaw,
and Sommers, 1984). The definition proposed by
Abetti (1989) has been used in this study. He
defines technology as ‘a body of knowledge,
tools, and techniques, derived from both science
and practical experience, that is used in the development, design, production, and application of
products, processes, systems, and services’
(Abetti, 1989: 37). Thus, technology not only
entails new product innovations and new processes by which outputs are generated, but also
includes scientific and practical know-how that
comes with experience.
For this study, technological alliance is defined
as any activity where two or more partners contribute differential resources and technological
know-how to agreed complementary aims
(Dodgson, 1993). This definition does not include
one-way transfers of know-how, such as licensing, marketing agreements, or simple one-time
only contracts. Rather, technological alliances, as
defined here, are continuing arrangements where
partners share their expertise and output. These
alliances represent a spectrum of interorganizational cooperative arrangements with a variety
of governance mechanisms (Borys and Jemison,
1989; Hagedoorn, 1990, 1993; Oliver, 1990; Ring
and Van de Ven, 1992). Firms may or may not
have legal contracts, and may or may not have
provided equity funding for a separate entity (e.g.,
joint venture). What is common to all of these
relationships is the commitment of two or more
companies to develop technology cooperatively,
thus strengthening their ability to keep pace with
technological advancements in the marketplace.
When top executives decide to investigate
potential technological alliances, they must collect
information that will allow them to evaluate and
compare various options. The important alliance
attributes for which information is sought may
be related to the technology around which the
alliance is to be structured, potential partner
characteristics, characteristics of the firm considering an alliance, and attributes of the proposed
relationship (Lambe and Spekman, 1997; Mohr
and Spekman, 1994; Tyler and Steensma, 1995).
The information obtained can then be assessed
by executives individually and incorporated into
the management team’s decision process.
Some of the information processed by executives as they individually assess potential technological alliances can be categorized as information

related to organizational opportunities and information related to organizational threats (Dutton
and Jackson, 1987). Moreover, research suggests
that there is a threat bias; that is, executives are
more sensitive to information that is associated
with threats than to information associated with
opportunities (Jackson and Dutton, 1988). In
addition, an organization’s image and identity
guide and activate its executives’ interpretations
of information and their motivations for action
(Dutton and Dukerich, 1991). It will be argued
here that executives’ personal experiences and
perceptions of their firms influence the extent to
which they focus on both opportunity and threatbased information while assessing potential technological alliances. More specifically, it will be
proposed that the concepts of strategic intent and
organizational stretch are related to opportunitybased information executives attend to when evaluating alliances, while two types of perceived
risk represent threat-based information (Das and
Teng, 1996; Hamel and Prahalad, 1989).
According to Hamel and Prahalad (1989: 67)
traditional strategy ‘focuses on the degree of fit
between existing resources and current opportunities’ while ‘strategic intent creates an extreme
misfit between resources and [organizational]
ambitions,’ and ‘challenges the organization to
close the gap by systematically building new
advantages’ aligned with tomorrow’s opportunities. Thus, strategic intent implies a sizable
‘stretch’ for an organization seeking to attain
clear ambitious goals. Efforts of firms to ‘stretch’
and take advantage of future opportunities are
reflected in their commitment to a technology
policy that supports firm strategy (Zahra and
Covin, 1993), their commitment to learn from
alliance partners (Hamel, 1991; Kogut, 1988),
and their sensitivity to the possibility of broad
corporate applications of technology and its
potential to expose the firm to related markets
(Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Tyler and Steensma,
1995; see Table 1).
Two types of perceived risk associated with
interfirm alliances may be considered threatening
to executives assessing technological alliance
opportunities: relational risk and performance risk
(Das and Teng, 1996, 1997; Ring and Van de
Ven, 1994). According to a great deal of research,
alliances as a structural form are inherently risky
and unstable due to the dual control nature of
the relationship, the intrinsic incentive to cheat,

and the uncertainty about the partner and its
changing goals (Parkhe, 1993; Inkpen and Beamish, 1997). Therefore, some of the risk perceived
by executives assessing potential technological
partners is associated with the risk of partnering
or relational risk (Das and Teng, 1996, 1997).
A second type of risk is associated with the
technology itself and its commercial success. This
risk may result from the unpredictable nature of
R&D activities, the high costs associated with
development, questionable market acceptance, and
the uncertain appropriability of the technology
(Chakravarthy, 1985; Pisano, 1990). This type of
risk has been labeled performance risk because
these risks exist even if alliance partners cooperate fully. Performance risk embraces all kinds of
hazards except those related to cooperation (Das
and Teng, 1996).
Examples of alliance attributes that top executives may associate with relational risk are the
compatibility of management styles (i.e., can we
work together?), the number of potential cooperative partners (i.e., what are my alternatives if
this partner acts opportunistically?), and the favorability of a potential partner’s cooperative history (Dodgson, 1993; Kogut, 1988, Pisano, 1990).
 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Factors that executives may associate with performance risk are the potential for decreasing
development risk by cooperating, the total
expected cost for developing the technology, the
ability to patent protect the technology once
developed, and the availability of technological
substitutes (Barney, 1991; Reed and DeFillippi,
1990; Tyler and Steensma, 1995).

BEHAVIORAL DECISION THEORY
According to behavioral decision theory, executives develop their own cognitive representations
of reality called schema or mental understandings
which are stored and then used as templates to
explain and interpret events (Hastie, 1981; March
and Simon, 1958). These mental structures control the encoding and reconstruction of information stored in memory. They also allow executives to select the information that is most
relevant in a given situation and process that
information quickly and efficiently (Oldfield and
Zangwill, 1942; Starbuck and Milliken, 1988).
This ability to attend to information selectively
is important because more information is typically
available for processing than individuals are cognitively capable of considering. Due to these
‘bounds’ or limitations of the human condition,
individuals must learn to amplify relevant information and attenuate irrelevant information in
order to create understanding (Simon, 1957).
While filtering is a necessary part of the human
perceptual process, it can lead to differences in
perception between people, and sometimes within
the same person at different points in time
(Schoemaker, 1990). Starbuck and Milliken
(1988) have delineated two types of perceptual
filtering that may vary the perceptions of
decision-makers: noticing and sensemaking. Differences in noticing may lead to perceptual differences as the decision-maker focuses less attention
on certain stimuli while other stimuli dominate
his or her attention. Perceptual differences due to
sensemaking occur as the decision-maker frames
the context of the decision, predicts possible outcomes, and forms causal attributions. Thus, during
the perceptual process, the potential exists for the
executive’s cognitive models or understandings to
influence not only what information is noticed,
but also the meaning attributed to that information.
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 4----->Executive Effects On Assessment Of Alliances
In order to ‘come to conclusions’ regarding the
attractiveness of technological alliance opportunities, executives must evaluate the available information and draw conclusions about their potential
(Russo and Schoemaker, 1989). According to
behavioral decision theory and cognitive research,
the information that executives attend to and the
weightings they give to various pieces of information will be influenced by the cognitive or
mental understandings they have developed over
time.

EFFECTS OF EXECUTIVES’
EXPERIENCES ON THEIR
ASSESSMENTS
Building on the premises of cognitive and
behavioral research, strategy researchers argue
that observable executive characteristics serve as
indicators of the mental models executives use
during strategic decision making (e.g., Hambrick
and Mason, 1984). Furthermore, research suggests
that these observable executive characteristics are
significantly related to what information is noticed
and how it is weighted when top executives
evaluate the desirability of strategic alternatives
(Hitt and Tyler, 1991; Melone, 1994).
Age
Child (1974) proposed that older executives are
more committed to the status quo than are
younger executives. It appears that, over time,
the mental models executives use during strategic
decision making become solidified through use
(Hambrick, Geletkanycz, and Fredrickson, 1993).
Age is highly correlated with total work experience, organizational tenure, and industry tenure.
This correlation makes it extremely difficult to
determine whether the relationship between age
and the strategic choices of executives is due to
cohort history, organizational experiences, industry-specific experiences, or seasonal phases, which
are distinct patterns of executive attention and
behavior that emerge over time. All of these
factors may affect the cognitive development of
mental understandings (Hambrick and Fukutomi,
1991; Hambrick et al., 1993; Hitt and Tyler,
1991; MacCrimmon and Wehrung, 1990). In any
event, executive experience, as represented by
age, can be argued to influence the mental under 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

standings executives use to process information
during strategic decision making.
Hambrick and Mason (1984) maintained that
firms with younger managers would be more
inclined to pursue risky strategies than would firms
with older managers. These authors also suggested
that younger managers are more likely than older
managers to seek growth through more novel and
innovative strategies in an effort to seize perceived
opportunities. Support for their beliefs was found
in a study of more than 500 top executives by
MacCrimmon and Wehrung (1990). In their study,
the most mature executives were also the most
risk averse (maturity was a combination of age,
seniority, and number of dependents). In addition,
Grimm and Smith (1991) found that top executives
from firms that changed their strategies were
younger than top executives from firms that did
not change their strategies.
Technological alliances provide firms with a
relatively novel and innovative strategy for
growth in an effort to seize perceived opportunities. They are also inherently risky and unstable,
due to the control nature of the relationship, the
incentive to cheat, and the uncertainty regarding
partners’ goals (i.e., high relational risk) (Parkhe,
1993; Inkpen and Beamish, 1997). Although
alliances may help to limit performance risk
associated with technology development such as
the sharing of costs and development risk, technological development in general is typically considered risky since there is no assurance the
technology will be developed or that a market
for the technology will materialize. Because technological strategic alliances are typically considered a fast and innovative route to firm growth
and are perceived as risky relative to other
methods of growth, such as acquiring technology
already developed, it is argued that older executives will be more conservative in their assessments of potential technological alliances than
younger executives.
Hypothesis 1: The older an executive is, the
less attractive potential technological alliances
will be to the executive.
Education
Education may be considered indicative of one’s
knowledge and skill base (Hambrick and Mason,
1984). As noted by Hitt and Tyler (1991), an
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

executive who has one type of formal education
can be expected to have developed different problem-solving skills and mental models with which
to evaluate situations than an executive with a
different type of formal education. For example,
Heilmeier (1993), CEO of Bellcore and the
Industrial Research Medalist for 1993, noted the
importance attributed to the technical training of
CEOs in the 1990s. He argued that the role of
top executives has changed from that of ‘operator’
to that of ‘designer’ and emphasized the need for
executives to understand not only the technology
that drives their business today, but also the
technology that will change their business in the
future. His arguments suggest that top executives
with a more complete understanding of the technological base of a company will be better able
to position the firm proactively to compete more
effectively in the future than executives without
an understanding of the firm’s technology.
It can be argued that executives with formal
educational training in science and engineering
will have a more complete understanding of the
technological base of the company, will be better
able to envision how technology might be
developed through cooperation, and will be more
committed to technological development than
executives with formal training in nontechnical
areas such as business or liberal arts. Moreover,
the technically trained executives should be more
capable of structuring a technological cooperative
relationship in a way that would be more advantageous to the technological needs of the firm.
On the other hand, executives without a technical
education can be expected to be aware of the
fact that they are less capable of assessing technological alliance alternatives than their colleagues
with a technical education and, therefore, should
be more conservative in their assessments.
Because they are more likely to know what information to look for, will notice more, can interpret
the information they receive with greater ease
(Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996), and are more
capable of structuring a technological alliance
relationship, top executives with a technical education can be expected to be more confident of
the firm’s ability to gain from such a relationship
and to be more optimistic in their assessment of
technological alliance opportunities than executives with other educational backgrounds.

Not only can it be expected that executives with
a formal technological education will be more
favorable toward cooperative opportunities than
those with a different educational background, but
they can also be expected to evaluate information
differently. Hitt and Tyler (1991) argued that an
executive’s educational background (i.e., liberal
arts, chemistry, engineering, etc.) is related to
what information they focus on and use during
evaluations of strategic alternatives. They found
that education type moderated the weighting of
information executives used when asked to evaluate a number of potential acquisitions.
Heilmeier (1993) suggested that technical training fosters in individuals a long-term commitment
to a deeper understanding of relevant technologies
and prepares an executive to predict, comprehend,
and
anticipate
long-term
change
(i.e.,
opportunities). Moreover, Finkelstein and Hambrick (1996) argued that executives with an indepth understanding of advanced technology
notice a greater proportion of the technological
information. They also require fewer pieces of
information to form an opinion about a technological trend than executives without this in-depth
understanding. Furthermore, there is speculation
that executives with only a formal management
education are more likely to pursue short-term
performance goals at the expense of innovation
and long-term asset building than executives with
other educational backgrounds (Hambrick and
Mason, 1984). Hambrick and Mason (1984)
argue that business schools are not effective at
developing risk-taking tendencies, but rather teach
future managers risk avoidance. In contrast, those
who are technically trained may not have been
socialized in this short-term, risk-averse orientation. In summary, those executives with a technical education may be more inclined to focus on
the opportunities provided by alliances in terms of
stretch and competency development and less
inclined to focus on relational and performance
risk when evaluating potential technological
alliances, as compared to those without a technical education.

educational background (i.e., engineering,
chemistry) will assess potential technological
alliances more favorably than executives with
other educational backgrounds.

<-----Page 6----->Executive Effects On Assessment Of Alliances
grounds will influence the weighting of alliance
attributes when assessing potential technological alliances. More specifically, executives with
formal technical education (engineering,
sciences) are expected to place more weight
on opportunities and less weight on threats
than those executives who lack a formal technical education.
Functional background
An early study by Dearborn and Simon (1958)
reported evidence that executives define problems
largely in terms of the goals and tasks in their
respective functional areas. While a number of
studies have not found support for Dearborn and
Simon’s original, somewhat simplistic contentions, there is support for a more complex
relationship between functional work experience
and strategic decision-making processes (e.g., Hitt
and Tyler, 1991; Melone, 1994). For example,
Walsh (1988) found that the belief structures
(mental understandings) managers brought to bear
on problems were not particularly simplistic or
narrowly functional. However, he did report some
support for hypotheses which argued that managers were likely to identify problems that were
from the same functional domain as the content
of their belief structures, and that managers were
likely to seek additional information from the
same functional domain as the content of their
belief structures. In a study of the effects of
functional background on executives’ selective
perceptions, Waller, Huber, and Glick (1995)
found that functional work experience had no
influence on which changes top executives perceived in their organization’s environment but did
influence the changes they perceived related to
organizational effectiveness.
An organization’s strategy partly determines
the types of functional expertise that will be
central to a firm’s success (Hitt, Ireland, and
Palia, 1982). Moreover, a firm’s relative emphasis
on technology will likely influence the functional
expertise considered important to success (Datta
and Guthrie, 1994). For example, executives with
backgrounds in R&D or engineering are arguably
consistent with ‘progress, invention, and improvement’ (Wiersema and Bantel, 1992: 100). The
managerial skills of these executives can be
expected to be particularly important to strategy
formulation and implementation in high 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

945

technology organizations, which must have substantial technical wherewithal to remain competitive (Hambrick, Black, and Fredrickson, 1992).
Govindarajan (1989) reported that functional
experience in R&D was positively related to the
successful implementation of a differentiation
strategy while functional experience in manufacturing was positively related to the successful
implementation of a low-cost strategy. This led
McGee, Dowling, and Megginson (1995) to argue
that new high-technology ventures whose management team’s functional experience fit with the
venture’s choice of competitive strategy would
be more successful in cooperative strategies than
ventures that lacked the functional experience–
strategy fit. In their study of new venture management teams, they found that cooperative
arrangements were most beneficial to those new
ventures whose management teams were relatively well versed in the technical aspects of their
business. It appeared to them that only firms with
technologically adept managers saw benefits from
collaboration. These arguments suggest the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3a:

Executives with technical

executives with other work

In a study of the influence of experience-based
expertise on decision processes, Melone (1994)
found that vice-presidents of corporate development (VPCDs) tended to be more optimistic in
their evaluations of acquisition candidates than
did chief financial officers (CFOs). Moreover,
VPCDs were likely to take a more balanced view
of strategic and financial matters in forming their
overall ratings while CFOs tended to place the
predominant emphasis on financial matters. Hitt
and Tyler (1991) also found that the information
executives notice and use when asked to evaluate
acquisition candidates is influenced by their functional experience. In other words, top executives
with dissimilar functional backgrounds weighted
the information they used in evaluating potential
acquisitions differently.
Similar to the arguments regarding the influence of technical education, top executives with
technical work experience can be expected to
weight the information they consider when
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 7----->946

assessing potential technological alliances differently from executives without technical work
experience. These executives can be expected to
be more sensitive to opportunities associated with
technological alliances (e.g., the importance of
the technology for the firm’s strategy, learning
opportunities) and less concerned about threats
related to relational and performance risk than
executives without technical work experience.
Hypothesis 3b: Executives’ work experience
will influence the weighting of alliance attributes when assessing potential technological
alliances. Specifically, executives with technical work experience (engineering, R&D) are
expected to place more weight on opportunities
and less weight on threats than those executives who lack technical work experience.

EFFECTS OF EXECUTIVES’
PERCEPTIONS ON THEIR
ASSESSMENTS
Executives’ perceptions of their companies’ context may also directly and indirectly influence
their assessments of potential technological strategic alliances. Perceptions of their companies’
emphasis on technology, risk orientation, and success with other technological alliances can be
expected to influence the information top executives notice, how they frame their assessments,
and the conclusions they draw (Dutton and
Dukerich, 1991; Russo and Schoemaker, 1989;
Starbuck and Milliken, 1988).
Technological emphasis
Technology procurement, a significant aspect of
the firm’s overall technology strategy, requires
careful integration of the various methods that
can be used to acquire technology. Some firms
will invest primarily in internal R&D, others will
invest in contracted R&D and joint ventures,
while still others may use a combination of acquisitions and licensing arrangements. Ford (1988)
argued that those firms with a high standing
in an area of technology, relative to industry
competition, will find it more appropriate to
develop internally any new technology related to
their core area, as opposed to using other methods
of procurement, such as technological alliances
 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

or acquisitions. Pisano (1990) found that companies tend to internalize R&D and avoid technological alliances in areas that constitute a high
percentage of their sales and where they have
extensive experience. Moreover, it has been
argued that when a firm’s strategy is highly
dependent on a given technology, executives may
not collaborate for fear of losing control over
vital intellectual capital (Harrigan, 1986).
The literature reviewed suggests that executives
who perceive their firm (1) to be dependent on
core technologies, (2) to have extensive expertise
in a technological area, and (3) to have a potential to lose control over vital intellectual capital
will be less motivated to participate in technological alliance opportunities than executives who do
not have these perceptions. Unsurprisingly, all
three of these conditions can be associated with
relational risk—the risk that partners may act
opportunistically. Arguably, the more executives
perceive their firms to emphasize technology the
more they can be expected to be concerned about
their firms’ dependency on specific core technologies, their capabilities to develop technology
internally, and their potential for losing control
over vital technological capital through strategic
alliances. Executives with these perceptions can
be expected to be less concerned about the risks
associated with developing the new technology
because they have established internal development capabilities. Thus, in firms where technology
is emphasized relational risk appears to take precedence over performance risk (Das and Teng,
1996).
In contrast, executives from firms that place
less emphasis on technology can be expected to
be more concerned about performance risk than
relational risk. These executives can be expected
to recognize that their firms have fewer internal
technological capabilities than potential partners.
Thus, they will be less concerned about opportunistic partner behavior and more concerned about
limiting the risks associated with developing the
new technology than executives from firms that
place more emphasis on technology. This should
make them more favorably disposed to alliances
as a method of technological development than
executives from firms that emphasize technology.
These arguments suggest the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 4a: The greater an executive’s
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 8----->Executive Effects On Assessment Of Alliances
perception that his/her firm emphasizes technology, the less attractive potential technological alliances will be to the executive.
Not only can top executives in firms that are
perceived to emphasize technology be expected
to judge technological alliance opportunities less
favorably, they can also be expected to focus on
different alliance attributes during the evaluation
process. From the arguments above, executives
from firms that are perceived to emphasize technology may be more aware of, and more concerned about, the opportunities a given alliance
provides than executives from firms that are perceived to emphasize technology less (Hamel,
1991; Kogut, 1988). In addition, these executives
may be particularly concerned with the relational
risk and less focused on performance risk than
executives from firms that place less emphasis
on technology (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990).
Hypothesis 4b: Executives’ perceptions of
their firms’ emphasis on technology will influence their weighting of alliance attributes when
assessing potential technological alliances.
Specifically, executives who perceive their firms
to emphasize technology are expected to place
more weight on the opportunities and threats
associated with relational risk, and place less
weight on threats associated with performance
risk than executives who perceive their firms
to place less emphasis on technology.
Risk orientation
Chiles and McMackin (1996) have suggested that
the often-ignored behavioral assumption of risk
neutrality, inherent in transaction costs economics, be relaxed in future research. They urge
researchers to acknowledge the variable risk preferences of firms and the unstated view of subjective economic costs. Sitkin and Pablo (1992)
integrated diverse theoretical streams of research
on risk taking into a comprehensive model which
suggested that individual, organizational, and
problem characteristics affect risk behavior
through the mediating mechanism of risk perceptions. One of the organizational characteristics
they believe influences an individual’s risk perceptions is an organization’s tendency to prefer
certainty vs. uncertainty and risk avoidance vs.
risk seeking (Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982).

Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) argued that social
information processing is a primary mechanism
by which organizations and organizational members influence the beliefs and perceptions of other
organizational members. Through socialization,
organizational members come to accept an organizational perspective that influences their mental
models. They then apply these models during the
perceptual process and begin to view their world
through the lens of their organization’s culture
(Ginsberg, 1990; Sitkin and Pablo, 1992).
Executives from firms perceived to be risk
seeking can be expected to be less concerned
about relational and performance risk than executives from firms perceived to be risk averse. This
risk seeking propensity, however, can be expected
to have little direct influence on executives’ overall assessments of technological alliance opportunities. A risk-seeking attitude toward relational
risk (less concern about potential opportunism)
would make the assessment more favorable while
a risk-seeking attitude toward performance risk
(less concern about sharing development risks)
would make the assessment less favorable; that
is, the two types of risk influence overall assessments in the opposite direction. Alternatively, a
risk-averse stance toward relational risk would
decrease the attractiveness of alliances. Simultaneously, the attractiveness of alliances would
increase due to their ability to limit performance
risk. Thus, executives’ perceptions of their companies’ attitudes toward risk taking is not
expected to directly affect their assessment of
technological alliance opportunities.
However, Sitkin and Weingart (1995) tested a
portion of the Sitkin and Pablo (1992) model
and found some support for the contention that
risk propensity moderated the relationship
between how the problem was framed and risky
decision-making behavior through its influence
on risk perceptions. Baird and Thomas (1985)
hypothesized that organizational variables
impinge on the strategist, whose resultant risk
estimates are seen as interacting with the nature
of the strategic problem. Sitkin and Pablo (1992)
argued that employees in organizations where risk
seeking or risk aversion are clearly favored will
perceive situational risks automatically and
unthinkingly. This would result in preprocessing
and biasing of information related to the decision
at hand. In organizational cultures where the risk
orientation was more moderate, Sitkin and Pablo
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 9----->948

B. B. Tyler and H. K. Steensma

(1992) predicted that decision-makers would
more carefully and slowly sort through the data,
resulting in a more accurate perception of situational risk.
These arguments suggest that a firm’s perceived risk propensity will influence how executives weight those attributes when asked to assess
technological alliance opportunities. For example,
executives from companies that are perceived to
be risk seeking can be expected to be less concerned about compatible management styles, the
partners’ cooperative history (i.e., relational risk),
the ability to patent protect the technology, and
the availability of technological substitutes (i.e.,
performance risk) than executives from companies that are risk averse.
Hypothesis 5: Executives’ perception of their
firms’ attitude toward risk taking will influence
their weighting of alliance attributes when
assessing potential technological alliances.
Specifically, executives who perceive their
firms to be risk seeking are expected to place
less weight on threats as compared to executives who perceive their firms to be risk averse.
Technological alliance experience and success
Technological alliance experience can lead to
learning. Research and theory suggest that a
learning curve exists whereby the first technology
transfer attempt a company is involved in will
be the most difficult and costly (Teece, 1976).
Initially, the process required to transfer technology is not well understood. Over time, however, firms move down a learning curve by
developing and codifying methods and procedures. Because most technology alliances
require the transfer of technology, either between
the partners or from the partners to a joint venture
which is established, it is reasonable to assume
that a learning curve also exists for the establishment and success of technological alliances.
At the individual level, past experience with
technological alliances can be expected to affect
the mental models used to judge technological
alliance opportunities (Hambrick and Mason,
1984). If executives and the companies they work
for do not have previous experience with joint
technological development, they can be expected
to be apprehensive of the potential pitfalls
associated with joint R&D and to have very
 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

incomplete mental models to apply in alliance
assessments. Support for this contention was
found by Bolton (1993) in interviews with top
executives involved in 14 U.S. collaborative
organizations. These interviews suggested that
senior executives are initially reluctant to engage
in collaboration with rival firms because of the
danger of leaking proprietary technical information. However, the more experience executives
had with technological alliances, the more
comfortable they became with these types of
associations.
Link, Tassey, and Zmud (1983) found that a
firm’s previous success in R&D is likely to lead
to future internal innovative efforts. These same
arguments could be applied to the propensity to
pursue technological alliances. The success of
previous or current technological alliances can
influence future alliance behavior and lead to an
increase in the probability of alliance success
(Lyles, 1988). In the words of Dierickx and Cool,
‘historical success translates into favorable initial
asset stock positions which in turn facilitate
further asset accumulation’ (1989: 1507). These
organizational assets may be tangible or intangible resources or cooperative capabilities embedded in organizational routines and systems within
the firm (Barney, 1991; Tyler, 1997). This asset
accumulation should make executives more optimistic when evaluating potential technological
alliance opportunities.
Hypothesis 6a: The greater an executive’s perception that his/her firm has been successful with
technological alliances in the past, the more
attractive potential technological alliances will be
to the executive.
Perceived success or failure with prior alliances
can also be expected to influence how executives
evaluate incoming information associated with
technological alliance opportunities (Bateman and
Zeithaml, 1989). Negative experience in a prior
alliance may cause an executive to focus on
particular attributes of these alliances. For
example, when an alliance was not successful
because of differences in the partners’ management style, an executive may weight that attribute more heavily in future assessments than an
executive who has not experienced poor results
due to this factor. Likewise, when alliance activity
has been deemed to be successful in the past, an
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 10----->Executive Effects On Assessment Of Alliances
executive may be more likely to key in on the
opportunities (e.g., learning, exposure to related
markets) in future assessments of potential
alliances. Indeed, Brockhoff (1992) found that
low levels of perceived success in R&D cooperative relationships were related to a relatively high
frequency of citing transaction costs as a disadvantage of the relationship. Therefore, executives
from firms that have not had success with their
prior alliances may focus more on the transaction
costs associated with potential technological
alliances than executives from firms that have
been successful with prior alliances.
These arguments suggest that executives who
perceive their firm as having been successful in
previous technological alliances can be expected
to focus more on the opportunities potential technological alliances provide than executives who
perceive their company to have been less successful. In addition, executives from firms that have
been more successful with technological alliances
in the past are less likely to focus on relational
and performance risk than executives from firms
that have not had positive past experiences
(Hladik, 1988).
Hypothesis 6b: Executives’ perceptions of
their firms’ success with previous technological
alliances will influence their weighting of
alliance attributes when assessing potential
technological alliances. Specifically, executives
who perceive their firms to have been successful in previous technological alliances are
expected to place more weight on opportunities
and less weight on threats than those executives who perceive their firms to have been
less successful in technological alliances.
A summary of the hypotheses proposed is
reported in Table 2.

METHODS
Sample
A survey instrument was used to collect the
data required for the study. The sampling frame
consisted of top executives (i.e., CEO, COO, vice
presidents reporting directly to the CEO) who
graduated from either a large Midwestern university or a smaller, prestigious engineering school.
 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

949

Many high-technology firms are small and private
while most sampling frames are biased toward
large publicly traded firms. The sampling frame
established by combining executives with degrees
from these two very different types of institutions
included top executives employed by public and
private companies that varied in size and industry
affiliation. It also provided a higher level of
variance in the type of degree awarded than
would have been possible if the sample had been
drawn from a single source. A random sample
of 130 executives was selected from a list of
1076 graduates from the Midwestern university
holding top executive titles in companies in
industries where technological development is
particularly relevant (manufacturing, utilities, and
software industries; 2-digit SIC codes 20–39, 49,
and 73). These same criteria were also utilized
in selecting the population of executives graduating from the engineering school. A random
sample was not taken from this population
because only 105 executives met these criteria.
To further verify their appropriateness, each
executive was contacted by phone and asked if
decisions regarding the pursuit of collaborative
technology development would be within his or
her decision-making authority. Of the 235 executives contacted, 168 met this criterion and were
mailed the survey instrument. One hundred and
one surveys were returned, for an overall response
rate of 60 percent. Seven responses were found
to have missing data required for testing the
hypotheses. In addition, responses on three surveys suggested that the firms in which the executives were currently employed were not within
the appropriate industries. This left a preliminary
usable sample of 91.
The average age of the 101 respondents was
49, and the ages ranged from 34 to 69. The
respondents had an average of 26 years of work
experience. Thirty-four percent held the position
of CEO or president, 8 percent were senior vice
presidents, while another 41 percent were vice
presidents. Seventy-one percent had previous
experience selecting technology partners. Furthermore, 49 percent of the executives had technical
academic degrees (engineering or physical
sciences), while 39 percent had undergraduate
business training. Forty-three percent held an
MBA degree. Twenty-six percent indicated that
their work experience was primarily technical
(engineering or R&D). Within the usable sample

(N = 91), 16 industries were represented, and the
annual firm sales averaged $728 million.
A comparison of the positions held by respondents and nonrespondents suggested no significant
differences. Moreover, 61 percent of the instruments sent to executives associated with the large
Midwestern university were returned, while the
engineering school executive alumni provided a
58 percent response rate. This suggests little
response bias due to school affiliation. Only one
industry sector revealed a difference in terms of
respondents and nonrespondents. The electrical
equipment sector (3600) made up 14 percent
of the respondents and only 7 percent of the
non-respondents.
Instrument
The survey instrument was made up of two parts.
One part contained a policy-capturing exercise
which included 30 scenarios of potential technological collaborative relationships described
through 17 criteria (discussed below). In addition
to the policy-capturing exercise, each respondent
was asked to complete a survey consisting of a
number of scales and questions soliciting descriptive data on the firm and the individual respondent. Thus, the packet of materials consisted of
three sets of scaled questions, a page of demographics, and the policy-capturing exercise. These
five items were randomly ordered before the survey was stapled and mailed to participants. This
precaution was taken to control for potential
order effects.

Decision models
The policy-capturing exercise was created to capture the decision models being applied by the
executives while assessing potential technological
collaborative opportunities within the context of
their organization. Policy-capturing techniques are
believed to tap the underlying cognitive processes
of the respondent more objectively than other
methods and are thought to reduce social desirability biases (Schwab, Rynes, and Aldag, 1987).
The external validity of this approach has been
further established through post hoc interviews
that indicated that policy-capturing models accurately represent decision-making behavior (Hitt
and Middlemist, 1979).1
Initially, the authors reviewed the literature on
technical collaborative relationships and selected
a set of primary considerations that are thought
to influence the attractiveness of these relationships. To verify the rationale and wording of the
factors, interviews were conducted with five top
executives and five academics who either were
involved in making similar decisions and/or had
1
This methodology has been broadly utilized in previous
organizational research to model decision processes (e.g., Hitt
and Middlemist, 1979; Hitt and Tyler, 1991; Tyler and
Steensma, 1995) and is similar to a repeated-measures design.
This technique allows for the assessment of actual ‘theories
in use’ as opposed to ‘espoused theories in action’ (Argyris
and Schon, 1974). Policy capturing requires the subjects to
evaluate a series of scenarios within the context of their
organization. Using regression, the executive decisions made
regarding each scenario can be aggregated and quantified into
a decision model identifying influential criteria.

Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 12----->Executive Effects On Assessment Of Alliances
published in this area. This led to a set of factors
that were pilot tested. Subsequent revisions from
the pilot test led to 17 factors. Twelve of the 17
factors can be categorized as factors associated
with strategic intent (stretch), relational risk, and
performance risk (compare Table 1 and the
Appendix). The sequence in which these factors
were listed in the actual scenarios was randomly
determined. This order, however, was consistent
for all 30 scenarios.
The 30 different scenarios were developed by
randomly assigning each of the 17 criteria a
number on a scale ranging from one (low) to five
(high). This random assignment creates diverse
collaborative opportunities while limiting collinearity. The highest correlation was r = 0.55, and
96 percent of the pairwise rs were below 0.40.
This suggests that the criteria are sufficiently
independent and free of collinearity. A sample of
one of the scenarios used in the study is provided
in the Appendix.
Dependent variable
Each respondent was asked to evaluate the same
set of 30 different scenarios. The dependent variable for each scenario was the executive’s rating
on two items, each on a 7-point Likert scale.
Executives were asked about the attractiveness of
the proposed relationship and the probability that
they would pursue such a relationship. These
items were combined to create the dependent
variable, ‘assessment of the opportunity’ (alpha
= 0.95). The resulting returns of 91 surveys
equated into a sample size of 2730 observations.
The assumption that each case represents an independent observation has previously been accepted
in the strategy literature (e.g., Hitt and Middlemist, 1979; Hitt and Tyler, 1991; Tyler and
Steensma, 1995).

951

neering or a physical science degree; otherwise
this variable was 0. The respondents were also
asked to indicate their primary work experience.
Those executives who indicated engineering or
R&D as their primary work experience were categorized as having principally technical work
experience. For these respondents, work experience was coded as 1. Executives who reported a
primary work experience other than these two
(e.g., marketing, production, finance, general
management) were coded as 0.
Perceived company characteristics
Technology emphasis
The firm’s emphasis on technology was measured
using a 3-item 5-point Likert scale (low to high).
Each respondent was asked: ‘How significant is
technology to the company’s strategy?’; ‘Is technological development a primary focus of the
company?’; and ‘How much emphasis does your
company place on developing new technological
skills?’ The coefficient alpha for this scale was
0.91.
Risk orientation
To capture the firm’s risk orientation, two previously utilized scales were combined: Khandwalla’s (1976) 6-item scale and a 2-item scale
derived from Miller et al. (1982). All eight items
used a 5-point Likert scale format. After data
collection, one item from Khandwalla’s scale was
found to be deficient and subsequently dropped,
leaving a 7-item scale (coefficient alpha = 0.86).
The scale was constructed so that the higher the
score on the 7-question scale, the greater the
firm’s propensity for risk taking.
Successful collaborative experience

Executive characteristics
Attributes of each respondent were obtained
through a series of survey questions. The respondents were asked to report their age, undergraduate and graduate degrees, and primary work
experience. ‘Age’ was a continuous 2-digit number reported by each participant. ‘Technical education’ was constructed as a dichotomous variable
(0 = no, 1 = yes). Participants were assigned a
value of 1 if the executive had either an engi 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A firm’s overall successful collaborative experience is a function of both the number of these
relationships that it had been involved in and the
success of these relationships. Thus, this measure
is comprised of two components: experience and
success. First, respondents were asked to indicate
how many collaborative technological relationships their firm had been involved in and the
number it was currently participating in. The
responses to these two questions were added to
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 13----->952

B. B. Tyler and H. K. Steensma

form the measure of total collaborative experience
(Experience). In order to establish the past success of collaboration for each executive’s firm, a
2-item scale was constructed. Each respondent
was asked to rate the overall success of previous
collaborative technology development activities
on a 5-point scale. They were also asked to
estimate the percentage of such relationships that
had been successful. This percentage was recoded
on a 5-point scale (1 = 0–20%, 2 = 21–40%, 3
= 41–60%, 4 = 61–80%, 5 = 81–100%), which
was then added to the overall success rating to
generate a 2-item scale of collaborative success
(Success). The alpha for these two items was
0.83. This measure of success was multiplied by
the firm’s total collaborative experience
(Experience × Success) in order to capture the
firm’s level of positive experience with technological collaboration as accurately as possible.
Control variables
Industry, firm size, performance, and individual
experience selecting collaborative partners were
controlled for in the analysis. During initial telephone screening, executives were asked to provide information regarding their firm’s primary
industry. This was further verified using the
CD/Corporate data base whenever possible. This
information was used to assign 2-digit SIC codes
to each respondent’s profile. The natural log of
annual sales, in millions, and its squared term
were used to control for size effects (Damanpour,
1992; Ettlie, 1983). The firm’s overall performance was estimated using a 5-item Likert scale
(1 = very low, 7 = very high) derived from
Khandwalla (1976). The respective items
addressed profitability, growth rate, employee
morale, financial strength, and public image
(alpha = 0.78). Finally, a dummy variable, indicating whether the executive had experience selecting technology partners, was included as a
control variable.
Pilot study
The survey instrument was piloted with executives involved in an executive development program and with part-time executive MBAs. Following data analysis, individual and group-level
results were provided to the participants. The
executives were debriefed in order to assess the

interpretation of the policy-capturing criteria and
survey scales. Any discrepancies in interpretation
were subsequently addressed in the final instrument by altering the wording of the criteria or
questions in the final questionnaire.

RESULTS
Prior to testing any of the hypotheses, each
executive’s individual model for assessing the
attractiveness of potential technological alliances
was determined by using stepwise regression to
analyze his or her response to the 30 scenarios.
Each of the 17 criteria were entered as independent variables in an attempt to explain the
variance of the executive’s assessment of opportunities. Stepwise regression accepts into the
model only those variables that are statistically
significant at p ⬎ 0.05. The explained variance
for each individual model represents the respondent’s internal consistency when evaluating the
30 collaborative opportunities. The complexity of
the individual models ranged from no significant
criteria to eight independent criteria entering into
an individual’s model.
In conformity with previous work that has
employed this policy-capturing technique (e.g.,
Hitt and Middlemist, 1979; Keats, 1991; Tyler
and Steensma, 1995), those respondents who
failed to generate individual models that
explained a minimum level of variance (R2 ⬍
0.40) were viewed as giving inconsistent
responses. It is suspected that these individuals
may not have viewed each scenario as independent of the others, or they may not have given
adequate time to the exercise. In essence, an
analysis of the individual models provides a check
with regard to the internal reliability of each
subject. Using the 0.40 cutoff, 21 individual models failed to meet this minimum standard; their
data were not included in any further analyses.
Observations from the remaining 70 respondents
were aggregated, providing a total sample of 2100
observations (70 × 30). Table 3 reports the means,
standard deviations, and Pearson product–moment
matrix of the dependent, control, and independent
variables (except for the alliance attributes) for
these 70 executives.
Hierarchical regression was used to test the
direct effects of the independent variables. Hierarchical moderated regression models were utiStrat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

lized to examine the hypothesized moderation
effects. Interaction terms between the measure of
interest and each of the 17 criteria within the
policy-capturing scenario were generated. A
restricted model included control variables, criteria, and the hypothesized direct effects of the
executive characteristics and firm perceptions.
The variance explained in this model was then
compared to the full model, which included all
of the variables in the restricted model and interaction terms. Moderated regression is considered
to be a relatively conservative method for examining interaction effects, as the interaction terms
are tested for significance after all main effects
are first entered into the regression equation
(McGee et al., 1995). To gain further insight into
the nature of the moderation effects, subsample
analysis was conducted for those moderators that
generated a significant difference in the restricted
and full models. The overall sample was split at
the median of the moderating variable, and separate regression models were generated for each
subsample.
Table 4 shows the results of the hierarchical
regression models used to test the direct effects.
Two models were created. Model 1 included all
70 executives, while Model 2 included only those
executives from firms that had prior experience
with technology-motivated collaborative arrangements (53 executives). In both of the models,

the control variables and the specific information
included in the scenarios were entered in the first
step and accounted for a significant amount of
variance. In Model 1, the second step included
all experience and perception variables hypothesized to have direct effects with the exception of
perceived successful collaborative experience. The
second step significantly improved the model (F
= 7.72, p ⬍ 0.001). In Model 2, the second
step included all the experience and perception
variables hypothesized to have direct effects.
Again, the second step significantly improved the
overall model (F = 7.99, p ⬍ 0.001). Individual
direct effects of the experience and perception
variables could then be assessed by examining
the direction and significance of the specific coefficients. For example, Hypothesis 1 proposed a
negative relationship between the age of executives and their assessment of alliances. The coefficient associated with age is negative and significant for the sample of 70 (Model 1: b = −0.03,
p ⬍ 0.001), providing support for Hypothesis 1a.
Similarly, it was argued in Hypothesis 2a that
having a technical education would positively
influence an executive’s ratings. The coefficient
associated with technical education in Model 1
of Table 4 is positive and significant (b = 0.35,
p ⬍ 0.05) and supports this hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2b suggested that executives will
utilize different information, depending on

whether or not they have a technical education
(i.e., a moderation effect). Table 5 displays the
results of the moderated regression models. The
change in R2 between the full and reduced model
involving technical education was significant (F
= 1.89, p ⬍ 0.05). Table 6 shows the results of
the subsample analysis. Coefficients are shown
only for those scenario attributes that were
associated with a significant interaction term (p
⬍ 0.05) in the moderated hierarchical regression
model. As anticipated in Hypothesis 2b, education
does moderate the overall decision model.
Specifically, those executives with a technical
education more heavily weighted the significance
of the technology to the firm’s current strategy
when evaluating potential technological alliances.
There was no significant difference in the weighting of the threat-based information.
Hypothesis 3a contended that primary technical
work experience would also be positively related
to the executive ratings of potential alliances.
Model 1 of Table 4 provides support for these
arguments (b = 0.49, p ⬍ 0.05). Hypothesis 3b
proposes that technical work experience would
moderate the relationship between the alliance
attributes and an executive’s ratings of attractiveness. No empirical support was found for this
hypothesis (Table 5).
Hypothesis 4a suggested a negative relationship
between the firm’s emphasis on technology and
the executive’s assessment of potential alliances.
No support was found for this relationship (Model
1, Table 4). Hypothesis 4b suggested that executives will utilize different information, depending
on their firm’s technological emphasis. The hier-

955

archical moderated regression model, as seen in
Table 5, provides support for this hypothesis (F
= 1.76, p ⬍ 0.05). Table 6 shows how executives
varied in their decision models depending on the
technical emphasis of their respective firms. In
particular, the executives who perceived their
firms to have an emphasis on technology placed
greater weight on opportunities (i.e., the potential
to learn, the significance of new technology to
strategy) and relational risk (i.e., partner’s cooperative history) and less weight on performance
risk (i.e., potential for decreasing development
risk).
Hypothesis 5 proposed that executives’ perceptions of their firms’ risk orientation influences
their weighting of information considered. The
change in R2 between the full and reduced model
was significant (F = 2.26, p ⬍ 0.01; Table 5).
This provides support for Hypothesis 5. Furthermore, Table 6 shows that the primary differences
lie in the weighting of performance risk attributes.
Contrary to expectations, executives who perceive
their firms to be risk seeking are more concerned
with the ability to patent protect the technology
and the availability of technological substitutes.
There were no significant differences in terms
of the weighting of information associated with
relational risk.
Hypothesis 6a suggested positive direct effect
between the successful experience (Experience ×
Success) that a firm has had with technology
relationships and the executive’s assessments of
such opportunities. This scale was only applicable
to those respondents from firms having a history
of collaborative relationships. Thus, the number

of respondents utilized was 53. Table 4, Model
2, indicates a significant and positive relationship
(b = 0.03, p ⬍ 0.001) providing support for
Hypothesis 6a. Finally, Hypothesis 6b posited
that a firm’s overall success with collaborative
relationships would influence the type of information utilized by executives. The hierarchical
moderated regression model for successful experience is shown in Table 5. There was a significant
change in R2 between the restricted and full
models (F = 2.91, p ⬍ 0.0001). Thus, the data
also lend support for Hypothesis 6b. The subsample analysis for successful experience, as reported
in Table 6, suggests that those executives from
firms that are perceived to have had alliance
success in the past place more weight on opportunity-based information (i.e., the significance of
the technology to current strategy) and less
weight on threat-based information.

DISCUSSION
The empirical data presented in this study support
the contention that top executives’ experiences
and perceptions influence the way they process
information when asked to assess potential technological alliances. Age, technical education,
technical work experience, and perceptions of
firm success with other technological alliances
were all directly related to top executives’ assessments of technological alliances (Table 4). No
support, however, was found for the assertion
that the more firms are perceived to emphasize
technology, the less attractive technological
alliance opportunities will be to executives. This
suggests that a company culture perceived to
emphasize technology does not necessarily cause
executives to be more critical of technological
alliance opportunities.
The study also found partial support for four
of the five hypothesized moderating effects
(Tables 5 and 6). Technical education and perceived firm technological emphasis, risk orientation, and previous success with collaborative
activities all moderated executives’ weightings of
alliance attributes when asked to evaluate potential technological alliances. The fact that a technical education, but not technical work experience,
moderated the use of information used by top
executives is notable.
The subsample analysis on the significant inter 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

action terms in the moderated regression model
for technical education found that top executives
with a technical education focused more on a
piece of information that represented an opportunity for the firm to stretch their current store
of resources (i.e., the significance of this technology to firm strategy) than did executives without a technical education (Subsample Model 1,
Table 6). Technically trained executives did not,
however, focus less on information related to
threats than executives with nontechnical education. These findings and the fact that technical
work experience did not moderate the weighting
of information suggest that undergraduate technical education does more to focus executives on
the technological opportunities associated with
technological alliances than technical work
experience.
Some support was found for all of the hypothesized differences in the weighting of opportunity
and threat-based information by executives who
perceive their firms to emphasize technology and
to have had success with previous technological
alliances (Subsample Models 2 and 4, Table 6).
These executives place more weight on opportunity-based information (i.e., significance of this
technology to strategy, and potential to learn) and
less weight on threat-based information associated
with performance risk (i.e., potential to decrease
development risk, availability of technological
substitutes, and total expected cost for
development) than executives who perceive their
firms to have less emphasis on technology and to
have had less success with previous technological
alliances. As predicted, executives who believe
their firms emphasize technology also focused
more on information that can be related to threats
associated with relational risk (i.e., favorability
of potential partner’s cooperative history) than
executives who did not have this belief. Likewise,
executives who perceive their firms to have had
success with previous technological alliances
focused less on information that can be related
to threats associated with relational risk (i.e.,
number of potential partners) than executives who
did not have this perception.
Although top executives from firms perceived
to have a risk-seeking orientation weighed information differently from executives from firms
perceived to have a more risk-averse orientation
(Table 5), they did not focus less on threat-based
information than those that perceived their firms
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 19----->958

B. B. Tyler and H. K. Steensma

to be risk averse (Table 6). Rather, executives
who perceive their firms to be risk seeking were
more, not less, sensitive to the performance risks
involved in technological development. They consistently considered the extent to which the technology to be developed could be patent protected
and the threat of substitute technologies meeting
market demand.

LIMITATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
The study has some limitations. Because it is
focused at the individual level, this study does
not capture the enactment process that takes place
at the organization level when top executives as
a group or team assess potential technological
alliances and make choices among the various
alternatives (i.e., choices between alliances and
choices between joint development, internal
development or acquisition). Thus, the results
suggest how top executives’ experiences and perceptions influence their attitudes toward potential
technological alliances and the kinds of information they attend to when individually assessing
potential alliance opportunities but does not suggest how their attitudes and cognitive orientations
might influence that of other executives when
top executives as a group are called to make
organizational choices. However, prior research
has failed to consider how executives’ cognitive
understandings affect their individual interpretations of alliance opportunities. When individual
differences in how executives evaluate strategic
options are better understood, research can be
conducted which looks at how these differences
affect the organizational decision process. Auster
(1994) called for research that incorporates cognitive and learning perspectives into the study of
interorganizational linkages. This study begins at
the most basic level, the individual top executive.
Hopefully, future research will consider how individual cognitive and learning processes affect
organizational knowledge structures.
Some could also take issue with the fact that
this study used an experimental design, which
could be perceived to be artificial and far
removed from day-to-day management in organizations. The limitations of experimental designs
are well documented, as are the limitations of
field studies. Schwenk (1982) proposed that the
limitations of these two methods of data collec 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

tion can be somewhat addressed by using both
methods in a complementary fashion. He suggested that the knowledge gained from more
closely controlled experiments can be used to
guide more grounded field research and the findings from subsequent field research can be used
to guide experiments. Schwenk also argued that
experiments are particularly effective in evaluating causal hypotheses because they remove the
complexities and confounding events which make
causal inference problematic in the field. Furthermore, Schoemaker (1990) argued that the policycapturing methodology appears to be especially
appropriate for capturing bounded and variable
rationality because it seeks to portray frames of
mind and processes of thought.
To date most academic research on alliances
in general, and technological alliances in particular, is based on field research. The results of
these field studies provided the foundation for the
experimental design used in this study. By using
an experimental design many of the complexities
that confound causal hypothesis testing in field
studies were controlled. The study supports the
contention that individuals are boundedly rational
and that variance in rationality between actors
results from differences in mental understandings
that result from differences in experiences and
perceptions. Moreover, the theory presented and
tested suggests that variable rationality is not
necessarily irrational. Too often scholars have
implied that variances in decision making due to
the information processor is somehow irrational
or biased. It can be argued that the results of
this study provide new insights that may be used
to guide future field research.
Although the potential technological alliances
assessed in the study were experimentally
designed, there is some justification for the belief
that executives participating in the study did not
see it as far removed from the day-to-day management of organizations. First, top executives
of high-technology firms helped to construct the
instruments used. These executives agreed that
an analysis of potential alliances that had been
rated by company staff or consultants along a
few important dimensions was realistic. Secondly,
71 percent of the respondents had experience in
selecting and negotiating technological alliances
in their own firms and could put the created
scenarios into a realistic context. Finally, executive education programs and consultants are
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 20----->Executive Effects On Assessment Of Alliances
actively measuring executives’ cognitive understandings, noting cognitive gaps and biases, and
developing special training programs in an effort
to improve organizational decisions and firm performance (e.g., Senge, 1990). This suggests that
executives recognize the importance of knowing
what they believe and how their beliefs affect
the decisions they make.
Another potential limitation of the study is that
it is cross-sectional and, thus, cannot capture
the dynamic aspects of the executive’s decision
process. The factors that might influence what
information an executive might acquire for
decision-making purposes, how the decisionmaking process itself is structured (e.g., a single
decision point vs. multiple decision points), or
how executives’ discretion may be limited are
not considered in this study (e.g., Dutton and
Duncan, 1987; Hambrick and Finkelstein, 1987).
Field research may better address these issues.
The overall effect size in terms of variance
explained by executives’ experiences and perceptions is relatively small. However, given the nature of the experimental design, this is not surprising, nor a reflection on the value of the findings.
In a highly structured experiment examining
executive decision processes, the objective information included in the scenario is expected to
dominate in terms of explaining variance (Hitt
and Tyler, 1991). Moreover, experiments are
known to be conservative in terms of effect size.2

IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND
RESEARCH
The results of this study contribute to theory
development and suggest future directions for
research. While prior decision-making research
based on cognitive modeling has focused primarily on moderating influences (e.g., Hitt and
Tyler, 1991; Ireland et al., 1987), this study
2
In a recent review of effect size estimates, Fern and Monroe
(1996) argue that the explained variance from contrived
experiments should not be expected to be sizable, and are
typically lower than those found in comparable field studies.
Experiments, however, are better able to uncover significant
causal relationships rather than assessing realistic effect sizes
(Fern and Monroe, 1996). In addition, when specifically
testing for moderation effects, Champoux and Peters (1980)
argue that the magnitude of change in variance explained
may not be an effective means for determining the relevance
of theoretical or practical insights.

considers both direct and moderating effects of
executives’ experiences and perceptions. Although
the results of this study suggest that the moderating effects of these factors provide more explanatory power than the direct effects, the study points
out the potential for factors such as technical
education, technical work experience, and successful firm experience to shift executives’ cognitive assessment of alliances, acquisitions, or even
new product opportunities up or factors such as
age to shift cognitive assessment down. Thus,
these factors can make executives more or less
disposed to participating in technological
alliances, acquisitions, or new product development. These findings suggest that future strategic
decision-making research should consider both
the direct and indirect effects of executives’
experiences and perceptions.
Some organizational researchers have not found
support for Dearborn and Simon’s (1958) supposition that executives define problems largely in
terms of the goals and tasks of the functional
areas with which they have been most closely
associated (e.g., Waller et al., 1995; Walsh,
1988). Inconsistent findings have resulted in a
somewhat limited understanding of how functional work experience influences the decisions
of top executives. The data reported in this study
suggest that researchers who have considered the
effects of work experience without controlling
for educational training may have unintentionally
confounded their results. The high correlation
between technical education and technical work
experience, reported in Table 2, supports the
possibility that some of the effects reported to be
related to work experience may well be the result
of early formal education. Future research should
be careful to separate educational experience from
work experience by partialing out the variance in
executives’ decisions attributed to each.
Hitt and Tyler (1991) did not find support for
the hypothesized moderation effects of executives’ risk orientation on the relationship between
objective decision criteria and strategic evaluations of acquisition candidates. They suggested
that their failure to find support for this hypothesis resulted from the fact that most of the top
executives in their study were risk seeking. The
results of this study indicate that the firm’s risk
orientation, rather than the executive’s, influences
the executive’s strategic decisions on behalf of
the firm. This seems logical for three reasons: (1)
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 21----->960

B. B. Tyler and H. K. Steensma

individuals’ general risk orientation, considered to
be a personality characteristic, may be far
removed from their cognitive risk orientation in
a specific situational context such as company
involvement in technological alliances; (2) executives are asked to make judgments or choices on
behalf of the organization; and (3) the consequences of the choices executives make in an
organizational context will be rewarded positively
or negatively by the organization.
Finally, the executive characteristics that moderated the weighting of alliance attributes during
the assessment of potential technological alliances
also influenced the amount of variance explained
by alliance attributes and controls (Table 6).
Thus, the alliance attributes and control variables
included in this study are better predictors of the
assessments of potential technological alliances
for some executives than for others. Future
research may suggest important alliance attributes
and moderating factors not considered in this
study, which may increase the predictability of
executives’ assessments.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
The results of this study have implications for
practice. First, the study supports the premise
that more technically trained individuals need to
occupy top executive positions and become
involved in making strategic decisions (Heilmeier,
1993). According to this study, executives with
technical training are more sensitive to the significance of the technology to firm strategy than
are executives without this training (Table 5).
This is not to imply that the CEO must necessarily have technical training, or that all top executives in technology-oriented companies should be
technically trained. It does, however, suggest that
some executives with technical training should be
included in organizational decisions related to
technology development.
Secondly, the findings provide insight into why
some firms invest a great deal of time and effort
into molding executives’ thinking to fit the
organizational mind set or dominant logic
(Prahalad and Bettis, 1986). These findings suggest that companies may be able to modify the
mental models executives utilize when asked to
make judgments on behalf of the company (Reger
and Palmer, 1996). Executives’ information proc 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

essing, in this study, was predictably affected by
their perceptions of their companies’ emphasis on
technology, risk orientation, and experience with
technological alliances. This predictability should
help the firm make consistent strategic decisions
even when different executives are required to
make choices.
The study does not, however, refute the possibility that companies may recruit executives who
already possess cognitive models that are valued
by the company (Barr, Stimpert, and Huff, 1992).
Firms in technology-oriented industries and those
that recognize the importance of an emphasis on
technology may hire executives with technical
degrees or individuals that believe that technological development is very important to a firm’s
future success. Thus, the study supports the idea
that a firm may both influence the mental understandings used by executives during decision
making, as well as recruit individuals with mental
orientations that support the goals of the firm.
The study’s results have implications for firms
looking for technological partners. Both company
and executive characteristics may be useful for
screening and selecting potential partner firms.
For example, past successful experience influences not only the likelihood that a company will
pursue such a relationship, but also the factors
that are more heavily weighted in the decision
process. Executives who perceive their companies
to have less successful technological alliance
experience incorporate more information related
to relational and performance risk (i.e., threats)
than did executives who perceive their firms to
have more successful experience but were less
sensitive to information regarding the significance
of the technology to firm strategy (i.e.,
opportunities). Those executives who perceive
their firms to have more successful experience
appear to be less concerned about threats and
more focused on strategic opportunities. On an
individual level, those executives with technical
degrees and work experience appear to be more
receptive, overall, to the notion of technological
collaboration. Thus, firms wishing to collaborate
with another firm may initially want to approach
executives in the potential partner firm who possess a technical background and who can then
‘champion’ the idea.
There are also normative implications to be
drawn from executives’ perceptions of their firms’
success with technological alliances. Perceptions
Strat. Mgmt. J., 19: 939–965 (1998)

<-----Page 22----->Executive Effects On Assessment Of Alliances
of firm success with technological collaboration
appear to make top executives less critical of
potential technological partners they are evaluating for future cooperation and therefore more
favorable toward alliances in general. This may
be because the firm has accumulated organizational assets related to cooperation which make
future collaboration easier or more beneficial
(Dierickx and Cool, 1989), as argued in the
theory section. This may also result, however,
from an overconfidence bias (i.e., ‘because we
have been successful in the past we are confident
that our technological alliances will be successful
in the future’). As reported in Table 5, executives
from firms perceived to have been successful in
prior technological alliances did not attend to
the potential risks associated with these types
of alliances. This lack of attention to pertinent
information regarding risks may cause executives
to enter into technological alliances that are not
in the best interest of the firm. Executives who
believe that their firms have been successful in
the past should, therefore, be careful to evaluate
appropriate
risk-related
information
when
assessing potential technological alliances.

CONCLUSION
As competition becomes more global and the
costs of technology development rise, firms are
establishing networks of strategic alliances. This
study’s findings support the contention that executives’ experiences and perceptions regarding their
companies’ context influence the cognitive models they use when asked to make alliance assessments. Furthermore, subsample analyses provided
insights into how specific executive attributes
affect what information is noticed and how it is
cognitively weighted when technological alliances
are evaluated. Thus, the study helps to address a
need in the literature in terms of integrating
behavioral and cognitive research with research
on interorganizational relationships (Auster,
1994).
