Winning the Battle but Losing the War:
The Psychology of Debt Management

ABSTRACT

When consumers carry multiple debts, how do they decide which debt to repay first?
Normatively, consumers should repay the debt with the highest interest rate most quickly.
However, because people tend to break complicated tasks into more manageable parts, and
because losses are most distressing when segregated, we hypothesized that people would pay off
the smallest loan first to reduce the total number of outstanding loans and achieve a sense of
tangible progress toward debt repayment. To experimentally examine how consumers manage
multiple debts, we developed an incentive-compatible debt management game, in which
participants were saddled with multiple debts and decided how to repay them over time.
Consistent with our hypothesis, four experiments revealed evidence of debt account aversion:
Participants consistently paid off small debts first, even though the larger debts had higher
interest rates. We also found that restricting participants’ ability to completely pay off small
debts, and focusing their attention on the amount of interest each debt has accumulated, helped
them reduce overall debt more quickly.

According to the Federal Reserve, the total outstanding credit card debt carried by
Americans reached an all-time high of $975 billion in 2008, a figure that will surely remain high
as more and more people reach for the plastic just to make ends meet. Additionally, according to
a recent Experian report (2009), consumers who use credit already hold over five credit cards on
average. As cautious lenders cut credit limits and force indebted consumers to find new sources
of credit, the number of different debts consumers carry is likely to further increase.
When consumers carry multiple debts, how do they decide which debt to repay first? The
question is relevant not only to consumer researchers and policy makers seeking to nudge
financial decision making in positive directions, but to lenders as well. Lenders manage risk by
assessing the likely speed at which their loans will be repaid, and to the extent that this depends
on the loan portfolios that borrowers already have, it is important for financial institutions to
understand where their loans stand in customers’ repayment hierarchy. This paper examines how
consumers manage multiple debts and assesses whether those decisions are consistent with
normative principles.
From a normative perspective, debt management is quite simple: In order to minimize the
total amount of debt across loans, people should first pay the minimum payment for each debt (to
avoid surcharges and penalties), and then use all available cash to pay down the loan with the
highest interest rate. Once this loan has been paid off, people should move to the loan with the
next highest interest rate, and so on.
From a psychological perspective, however, there is reason to suspect that consumers
might stray from normative principles when managing debt (cf. Stango and Zinman 2009a;
Stewart 2009), as they do in many other financial domains (Benartzi and Thaler 2007).
Consumers tend to greatly underestimate how interest compounds over time, for both saving and

<-----Page 4----->5
debt accounts (e.g., Eisenstein and Hoch 2005; Stango and Zinman 2009b). If indebted
consumers do not fully appreciate the implications of interest rates, they may not base their
decision of which debt to repay on which debt has the highest interest rate. This is consistent
with prior work demonstrating that difficult-to-evaluate attributes tend to receive less weight in
decision-making (Hsee 1996; cf. Denes-Raj and Epstein 1994; Gigerenzer and Hoffrage 1995;
Pacini and Epstein 1999).
One way in which consumers might stray from normative principles when managing
multiple debts is by treating debt repayment decisions like asset allocation decisions. Benartzi
and Thaler (2001) found that many people faced with the decision of how to allocate their
retirement contributions across saving plan funds appeared to rely on a 1/n heuristic, dividing
their contributions evenly across all the funds offered in the plan. If consumers find the decision
of which debt account(s) to repay similarly complex, this naïve diversification heuristic may
generalize to the debt repayment domain.
While diversity is often sought in the domain of gains (cf. Kahn and Ratner 2005; Read
and Loewenstein 1995; Simonson 1990), other work suggests that diversity can be aversive in
the domain of losses (e.g., Ayal and Zakay 2009; Thaler and Johnson 1990). If consumers cannot
completely pay off their debts, then spreading the limited money set aside for debt repayment
across debts is likely to maintain diversity (i.e., distinct debts). Thus, it is questionable whether
the 1/n heuristic would generalize to the domain of debt repayment. Instead, we propose that
consumers saddled with multiple debts will primarily be motivated to reduce their total number
of outstanding loans, rather than their total debt across loans, a phenomenon we refer to as debt
account aversion.1

<-----Page 5----->6
Several psychological processes are likely to contribute to debt account aversion. First,
when a superordinate goal is perceived as difficult, people often adopt subgoals that break the
overall task into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., Newell and Simon 1972). To the extent
that becoming debt-free is perceived as a difficult superordinate goal, consumers may adopt
subgoals focused on paying off individual loans. The danger in such an approach is that focusing
on and achieving subgoals can actually diminish the motivation to pursue superordinate goals
(e.g., Amir and Ariely 2008; Fishbach and Dhar 2005; Fishbach, Dhar, and Zhang 2006; Heath,
Larrick, and Wu 1999). Inexperienced cab drivers, for example, tend to set daily income targets,
working the least on the busiest days, which undermines their ultimate goal of maximizing
lifetime income (Camerer et al. 1997).
Additionally, a large body of research on animal learning lends credence to the GoalGradient Hypothesis, which posits that the motivation to complete a goal increases with
proximity to the goal (e.g., Heilizer 1977; Hull 1932). Kivetz, Urminsky, and Zheng (2006; see
also Nunes and Dreze 2006) demonstrated that even the illusion of progress toward a goal
increases effort acceleration. For example, coffee shop customers who received a 12-stamp
reward program card with two preexisting “bonus” stamps completed the ten required purchases
faster than customers who received a standard 10-stamp card. Analogously, in the context of debt
management, consumers may be more motivated to achieve goals that are proximal (e.g., paying
off debts with small balances) than goals that are distal (e.g., becoming completely debt-free).
The shape of the prospect theory value function in the loss domain (Kahneman and
Tversky 1979) also suggests that consumers might be primarily motivated to reduce the number
of debts as soon as possible. Because the convex loss function is steepest near zero, multiple
losses (debts) should be more distressing than a single loss of equivalent total value (cf. Thaler

<-----Page 6----->7
and Johnson 1990). Indeed, recent work on “diversity aversion” suggests that consumers are
motivated to integrate losses even when this consolidation runs counter to rational considerations
(Ayal and Zakay 2009). Further, the steepness of the loss function near zero also implies that
paying off a small debt will provide greater relief than making a similar reduction to a larger
debt.
Taken together, the research discussed above suggests that consumers are likely to
manage multiple debts in ways that can ultimately impede their ability to rid themselves of debt.
While this might naturally seem like a cause for concern among those interested in protecting
consumer welfare, some financial gurus actually endorse debt account aversion. For example,
Dave Ramsey, one of the most popular personal finance gurus in America and author of the 2007
best-seller The Total Money Makeover, actively advocates what he calls the “snowball method”
of debt repayment. Ramsey (2009) claims that although “the math seems to lean more toward
paying the highest interest debts first,” consumers need “some quick wins in order to stay
pumped enough to get out of debt completely.” The research discussed above suggests that
Ramsey may be preaching to the choir, and further encouraging non-optimal behavior driven by
some basic human biases.

FIELD SURVEYS

We initially explored whether consumers were debt account-averse in three field surveys.
As an initial conservative test of debt account aversion, we conducted Field Survey 1 with a
sample of financially knowledgeable consumers. Specifically, in the summer of 2009, we
worked with CNBC, a financial news channel on cable television, to conduct a survey of

<-----Page 7----->8
viewers’ financial habits. A total of 171 viewers (29% female; mean age: 33) of Squawk on the
Street, a business news program that airs weekdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET on CNBC, logged
onto the CNBC website to complete the survey. Their incentive for participating was receiving a
report of the survey’s results once it concluded. In the survey, we asked participants to imagine
that they had two credit card accounts: a MasterCard account with a $100 balance and a 10%
APR, and a Visa account with a $1,000 balance and a 15% APR. They were also asked to
imagine that they had just received either a $100 or $1,000 government stimulus rebate and that
they had decided to use the entire rebate to repay debt. Finally, they were asked how much they
would repay on each account.
Regardless of the size of the rebate, participants should use the entire rebate to pay down
the high-APR (and high-balance) account. However, consistent with debt account aversion,
participants repaid significantly more money on the low-APR (and low-balance) account when
the rebate was $100 than when the rebate was $1,000 ($32.41 vs. $12.62; t(169) = 3.35, p <
.001). In other words, eliminating participants’ ability to completely pay off the high-APR
account significantly reduced their willingness to repay money to that account. Instead, many
participants in the $100 rebate condition chose to completely pay off the low-APR account,
presumably due to debt account aversion.2
Because the CNBC survey did not measure participants’ actual credit card debt, the
above results cannot rule out the possibility that the desire to close out accounts is restricted to
people who have limited debt management experience. Field Survey 2 addressed this limitation.
The survey was conducted online, and participants were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk, a website commonly used to recruit adult participants and validated by Buhrmester,
Kwang, and Gosling (in press) and Paolacci, Chandler, and Ipeirotis (2010). A total of 177 U.S.

<-----Page 8----->9
adults (54% female; mean age: 34) participated in exchange for a small payment. All participants
were presented with the $100 rebate version of the debt repayment scenario and were later asked
to report their household-level credit card debt.
We analyzed the data by participants’ household-level credit card debt.3 Approximately
22% of participants reported that they did not use credit; 33% reported that they used credit but
carried no revolving debt; and 45% reported that they used credit and carried revolving debt
(median debt level: $2,500 - $5,000). Indebted credit users reported that they would repay $55.19
to the low-APR account. This was not significantly different than the low-APR repayment
amount reported among non-users ($54.87; t(116) < 1), but it was significantly greater than the
low-APR repayment amount reported among debt-free users ($31.02; t(136) = 3.08, p < .005).
Thus, we observe debt account aversion among credit users, particularly if they are carrying
debt.4
Finally, in Field Survey 3, we examined whether consumers are debt account averse with
respect to their real debts. A total of 390 people (58% female; mean age: 43.9) who had
previously completed a spending survey posted on the New York Times website (see Rick,
Cryder, and Loewenstein (2008) for original survey details) completed the present survey.
Participants indicated whether they currently carried credit card debt and, if so, how many of
their credit cards carried debt. Participants with credit card debt also indicated the amount of
each debt and how much they planned to pay on each debt in the next billing cycle.
Forty-three participants reported carrying debt on multiple cards. These multiple-debt
holders carried debt on two to seven credit cards (M = 3.3), and carried between $250 and
$65,000 in total debt across cards (M = $16,168). For each multiple-debt holder, we computed
the proportion of total debt accounted for by the smallest debt (D) and the proportion of total

<-----Page 9----->10
repayments to be allocated to the smallest debt (R). For example, if a consumer’s Debt A is $100
and Debt B is $400, and the consumer plans to pay $100 on Debt A and $200 on Debt B in the
next billing cycle, then D = 0.20 and R = 0.33. If R > D, then consumers are devoting
disproportionate effort toward closing the smallest debt, presumably due to debt account
aversion. Indeed, consistent with debt account aversion, we found that R was significantly
greater than D on average (0.27 vs. 0.16, t(42) = 3.91, p < .001, paired t-test).5
These initial results suggest that debt account aversion might be a common approach to
managing multiple debts. However, many open questions remain regarding the generality of the
phenomenon and its boundary conditions. For example, does this non-optimal behavior persist
when there are immediate monetary incentives to behave optimally? Does debt repayment
behavior become more optimal in repeated decision settings? More importantly, how can we
help consumers make more optimal debt repayment decisions? To address these questions, we
developed an incentive-compatible debt management game for the laboratory.

OVERVIEW OF THE DEBT MANAGEMENT GAME

In the debt management game, participants were saddled with multiple debt accounts that
varied in amount and annual interest rate (see Table 1).6 The basic game lasted for 25 rounds,
and each round represented one year. In each round, participants received a $5,000 cash
allotment that they could use to pay down one or more of the open debt accounts. Additionally,
participants occasionally received cash bonuses that could also be used to pay off their debts
($20,000 in round 6; $15,000 in round 12; and $40,000 in round 19). Participants repaid debts by
typing in the amount they wanted to allocate to each debt account and then approving it. After

<-----Page 10----->11
participants approved their decision, the program presented the updated balance of each debt and
a graph displaying the past and current standing of each debt (see Appendices for sample screen
shots; full game instructions as well as log-in information for the online game are available from
the corresponding author upon request).
A financially optimal player, who allocates all available cash in each round to the open
debt with the highest interest rate, would first pay off Debt 6, then Debt 5, then Debt 3, and then
begin to repay Debt 4 (the game would end before Debt 4 could be completely repaid). The
financially optimal player would never allocate any cash towards Debts 1 and 2, and would
conclude the game with three open Debts that sum to $29,428 in total debt. By contrast, a debt
account-averse player, focused exclusively on paying off the smallest open debt, would first pay
off Debt 1, then Debt 2, then Debt 3, then Debt 4, then Debt 5, and then begin to repay Debt 6
(the game would end before Debt 6 could be completely repaid). The debt account-averse player
would conclude the game with one open Debt and $47,861 in total debt.
The game was incentive-compatible. Participants were told that they would receive a
bonus based on how low their total debt was at the end of the game. In addition to an $8 show-up
fee, players received a bonus between $1 and $4 based on their performance: Specifically, they
received $4 if their total debt was less than $30,000, $3 if their total debt was between $30,000
and $35,000, $2 if their total debt was between $35,000 and $40,000, and $1 if their total debt
was greater than $40,000.

Table 1. The interest rate and initial size of each debt
We built on this basic paradigm to conduct four experiments, each designed to shed light
on different aspects of debt repayment behavior. Experiment 1 examined whether participants
exhibited debt account aversion, and whether this tendency was amplified when participants had
the opportunity to save some of their available cash. We then examined whether we could
increase the optimality of debt repayment behavior by restricting participants’ ability to close
accounts. Specifically, we manipulated whether or not participants had enough money to
completely pay off any individual debt (Experiment 2), and whether or not small debts were
consolidated into one larger account (Experiment 3). Although the interventions in Experiments
2 and 3 created a setup that would hurt a financially optimal player who acted by focusing only
on repaying the loan with the highest interest rate, each intervention should prove beneficial in
practice if consumers are naturally focused on closing out debt accounts as soon as possible.
Finally, in Experiment 4 we examined the effectiveness of a more practical intervention, which
hurts neither financially optimal nor debt account-averse players. Specifically, we examined
whether changes in the display that highlight the actual amount of interest already accrued, or the
amount that could be accrued in the future, helped participants to appreciate the monetary
implications of interest rates and thus focus on repaying the highest-interest debts first. All four
experiments were conducted at the same university, but laboratory software ensured that
participants never completed more than one experiment.

EXPERIMENT 1: DEBT ACCOUNT AVERSION

<-----Page 12----->13
The primary purpose of Experiment 1 was to examine whether the debt account aversion
observed in the field surveys replicates in an incentive-compatible context (the debt management
game). The experiment included two between-subjects conditions to explore whether eliminating
participants’ ability to save money increases the optimality of their debt repayment decisions. In
the No-Saving condition, participants in each round were required to allocate all of their
available cash to one or more of the open debt accounts before proceeding to the next round. In
the Saving-Allowed condition, participants could choose how much of their available cash they
wanted to use to repay debts. Any unused available cash was stored in their “checking” account
and accumulated interest at an annual rate of 2%. Any cash stored in the checking account could
be used to repay debts in later rounds. Thus, if participants in the Saving-Allowed condition
realized that they made a mistake by saving money, they could partly undo it by using that
money to repay debts in subsequent rounds. At the end of the game, total debt was automatically
reduced by the amount of cash remaining in the checking account (if any). Importantly, because
the interest rate on savings in the Saving-Allowed condition was less than or equal to the interest
rates of all the debts (all debt interest rates were 2% or greater), participants should not save in
the Saving-Allowed condition. Thus, the total debt of a financially optimal player at the end of
the game should be $29,428 in both conditions.
Note that the Saving-Allowed condition partly reflects how debts are repaid outside the
lab; once minimum payments have been made, people must decide what share of their remaining
income will be allocated to repaying debt, and how much will be saved or used for other
purposes. However, if achieving subgoals can demotivate people from pursuing superordinate
goals (e.g., Amir and Ariely 2008; Fishbach and Dhar 2005), people who pay off a debt in a
given round may feel as if they have done enough for that round, saving the rest of their cash (as

<-----Page 13----->14
opposed to using that cash to pay down another debt). Additionally, despite the fact that money
can only be used to pay down debt, people might have difficulty overcoming the inclination to
keep some cash at hand, perhaps for additional flexibility (cf. Shin and Ariely 2004). Thus, we
predicted that total debt at the end of the game would be greater in the Saving-Allowed condition
than in the No-Saving condition.
One hundred and sixty two undergraduate students (56% female; mean age: 21.5) at a
private mid-Atlantic university participated in the experiment.

Results and Discussion
Mean total debt in both conditions was significantly greater than the total debt of a
(hypothetical) financially optimal player ($29,428; both ps < .001). Across both conditions, the
average participant lost $12,051 due to non-optimal debt repayment decisions. Below, we
examine treatment differences and the magnitude and frequency of non-optimal behavior across
rounds. Finally, we examine whether behavior more closely resembles that of a financially
optimal player or a debt account-averse player.
Treatment Differences. Total debt in the Saving-Allowed condition was significantly
larger than total debt in the No-Saving condition ($44,513 vs. $38,371; t(160) = 4.29, p < .001).
This difference is not driven by treatment differences in which debts were repaid; there was no
significant difference between conditions in the probability of closing any of the six debts (all ps
> .10). Rather, the difference appears to be driven largely by the fact that some people in the
Saving-Allowed condition retained some money in their checking account. Forty-four percent of
participants in the Saving-Allowed condition saved at least some portion of their available cash
in each round. These participants were significantly more likely than Saving-Allowed

<-----Page 14----->15
participants who did not always save to completely pay off the smallest four debts (Debts 1-4;
64% vs. 37%; χ2(1) = 5.86, p < .025).
Magnitude and Frequency of Non-Optimal Behavior. Although participants were
explicitly informed about the different interest rates, and saw how those rates influenced the size
of their debts each round (see Appendices), not even one participant consistently demonstrated
financially optimal behavior. That is, no participant consistently repaid, in each round, all of their
available cash to the open debt account with the highest interest rate. This pattern largely held
even when we used a more relaxed definition of financially optimal behavior: Only five of the
162 participants (3%) repaid at least 90% of their available cash to the open debt account with
the highest interest rate in each of the final 10 rounds of the game.
To further explore and quantify repayment behavior, we define any money that was not
allocated to the open debt account with the highest interest rate (including any money saved in
the Saving-Allowed condition) as “non-optimally allocated money.” The open debt account with
the highest interest rate was assessed for each participant in each round (most often Debt 6, but a
different debt if that participant had already closed Debt 6). Figure 1 displays the percentage of
money that was allocated non-optimally in each round (pooling across participants). In the NoSaving condition, approximately half of the available cash was allocated non-optimally in each
round (M = 51%, SD = 13%). The opportunity to save cash significantly increased the
percentage of money that was allocated non-optimally (M = 59%, SD = 17%; t(160) = 3.50, p <
.005). A repeated measure ANOVA treating the mean proportion of non-optimally allocated
money as the dependent measure, and condition and round as the independent variables, revealed
a significant main effect of condition (F(1,160) = 12.15, p < .005) and a significant main effect
of round (F(24,3840) = 3.08, p < .001), indicating that less money was allocated non-optimally

<-----Page 15----->16
as the game progressed. Pooling across conditions, the average percentage of non-optimally
allocated money decreased somewhat between rounds 1-5 and rounds 21-25 (55% vs. 50%,
t(161) = 1.87, p < .10), presumably reflecting modest learning over time.7

Comparing Behavior to Financially Optimal and Debt Account-Averse Benchmarks. A
financially optimal player will begin the game by paying off the debt with the highest interest
rate (Debt 6) and will close this debt in round 11. By contrast, a debt account-averse player will
begin the game by paying off the smallest debt (Debt 1) and will close this debt in round 1.
Pooling across conditions, no participant had closed Debt 6 in round 11, but 12% had closed
Debt 1 in round 1, indicating that participants were significantly more likely to begin the game as
debt account-averse players than as financially optimal players (χ2(1) = 20.18, p < .0001). In
addition, participants were significantly more likely to completely pay off Debt 1 by the end of
the game than to completely pay off Debt 6 by the end of the game (70% vs. 40%, χ2(1) = 29.97,
p < .0001).
We also categorized participants based on whether they completely paid off the debts that
a financially optimal player would pay off (Debts 3, 5, and 6) or whether they completely paid
off the debts a debt account-averse player would pay off (Debts 1-5). Participants were
significantly more likely to close the debts that a debt account-averse player would close than
they were to close the debts that a financially optimal player would close (11% vs. 4%; χ2(1) =
5.66, p < .025).
While the absolute magnitude of pure debt account aversion is low, it is worth noting that
debt account-averse consumers may be focused on closing small loans rather than the smallest of

<-----Page 16----->17
several loans. For example, after a pure debt account-averse player begins the game by closing
Debts 1-4 (all below $15,000), they are then confronted with two debts that are each above
$50,000. Debt 5 is the smallest of the two remaining debts at that point, but the debt may not be
considered “small” in absolute terms. If we focus only on the Debts that are likely to be
considered small in absolute terms (Debts 1-4), the magnitude of debt account aversion
increases: pooling across conditions, 46% of participants completely paid off Debts 1-4.
Figure 2 presents the average round each debt was closed by condition, as well as the
round in which the debts would be closed by a financially optimal player and a debt accountaverse player. (Debts that remained open at the end of the game were assigned a value of 26.)
While the difference between conditions is small, behavior in both conditions differs markedly
from that of a financially optimal player. The slopes of the Saving-Allowed, No Saving, and
Debt Account-Averse lines are all positive, whereas the slope of the Financially Optimal line is
negative. The difference between actual behavior and the financially optimal benchmark is most
pronounced for the debt with the highest interest rate (Debt 6). Pooling across conditions, we
found that Debt 6 was closed on average in round 23. By contrast, a financially optimal player
would close Debt 6 in round 11. The difference between when Debt 6 was actually closed (by
participants) and when Debt 6 should have been closed (by a financially optimal player) was
significant (round 23 vs. round 11, t(161) = 36.49, p < .0001, paired t-test). Analogously, the
debt with the lowest interest rate (Debt 2) was closed on average in round 17. Normatively, Debt
2 should still carry debt at the end of the 25 rounds (i.e., never close). Thus, participants deviated
markedly from financial optimality, in a direction consistent with debt account aversion.

EXPERIMENT 2: SHORT ON CASH

The field surveys and Experiment 1 suggest that debt account aversion is a common
response to multiple debts. We have proposed that the tendency to break complicated tasks into
smaller, more manageable pieces (subgoals) contributes to debt account aversion. Becoming
debt-free is often a long and costly journey that might seem less daunting by focusing on closing
individual debts. Previous work suggests that pursuit of superordinate goals can be improved by
preventing people from achieving, or attending to their achievement, of subgoals (e.g., Amir and
Ariely 2008; Fischbach, Dhar, and Zhang 2006). Accordingly, in Experiment 2 we examine
whether preventing participants from closing small debts in the debt management game improves
their overall performance. Specifically, we manipulate whether or not participants have enough
money to completely pay off their smallest debt (for this experiment we created a set of one-shot
decisions, rather than using a repeated game). We predicted that blocking participants’ ability to
completely pay off any of their debts would force them to abandon their intuitive approach to
debt management and ultimately help them to reduce overall debt more quickly.
Participants began the experiment by playing ten rounds of the debt management game,
to help them understand how debt account interest compounds over time. All participants played
the game in a format identical to the No-Saving condition in Experiment 1. Next, we presented
all participants with two different debt Portfolios. Each Portfolio had a High-Cash and Low-Cash
version, for a total of four one-shot decisions (see Table 2). Each participant completed all four
decisions (a within-subject design), and the order in which the decisions were presented was
counterbalanced across participants. In half of the decisions (High-Cash condition), participants

<-----Page 18----->19
received enough cash to be able to completely pay off their smallest debt. In the other half (LowCash condition), the same participants did not receive enough cash to be able to completely pay
off their smallest debt. Thus, in the Low-Cash condition, participants had to decide which debt
account(s) they wanted to reduce without having the ability to close any of them. In addition to
the four decisions of interest, we included two filler decisions (in which participants had enough
money to completely pay off the largest debt in two different portfolios) to obfuscate the purpose
of the experiment.
Sixty-five undergraduate students (50% female; mean age: 22) at a private mid-Atlantic
university participated in the experiment in exchange for a show-up fee of $8. In this experiment
only, participants were not paid based on their decisions.

Results and Discussion
We pooled data across Portfolios. Consistent with debt account aversion, the mean
percentage of non-optimally allocated money was significantly greater in the High-Cash
condition than in the Low-Cash condition (53% vs. 43%, t(64) = 3.58, p < .01, paired t-test). In
addition, we found that the percentage of available cash allocated to the smallest debt was
significantly greater in the High-Cash condition than in the Low-Cash condition (13% vs. 5%,
t(64) = 2.44, p < .025, paired t-test).
The results suggest that eliminating participants’ ability to completely pay off their

<-----Page 19----->20
smallest debt helps to shift their focus toward the overarching goal of reducing overall debt, thus
increasing the optimality of their repayment behavior.

EXPERIMENT 3: THE BENEFITS OF (COSTLY) DEBT CONSOLIDATION

Experiment 2 suggests that the harmful effects of debt account aversion can be reduced
by eliminating participants’ ability to completely pay off small debts. However, the
“intervention” utilized in Experiment 2 (restricting the amount of available cash consumers have
on hand) would obviously not be something policy makers or creditors could implement. Thus,
in Experiment 3 we examined whether a common intervention – debt consolidation – could be
similarly effective. By consolidating several small loans into one larger loan, we distance
participants from achieving subgoals focused on paying off individual loans and potentially shift
their attention toward the overarching goal of reducing total debt (cf. Amir and Ariely 2008).
Indeed, if debt account-averse consumers are focused on closing small loans rather than simply
the smallest of several loans, consolidating several small loans into a large loan may completely
eliminate participants’ ability to achieve their natural subgoals.
The experiment consisted of two between-subjects conditions. The Control condition was
identical to the No-Saving condition in Experiment 1. In a Debt Consolidation condition, Debts 5
and 6 remained the same as in the Control condition, but the four smallest debts (Debts 1-4) were
integrated into one consolidated loan ($35,000 at a 3% interest rate). The interest rate of the
consolidated loan was slightly larger than the weighted average of the interest rates of the
smaller individual loans (

= 2.98%). This increase captures the

fact that debt consolidation often comes at a cost (e.g., in the form of balance transfer fees).

<-----Page 20----->21
Critically, this increase also implies that a financially optimal player will conclude the game with
slightly more debt in the Debt Consolidation condition than in the Control condition ($29,939 vs.
$29,428). However, if consumers are naturally inclined to pay off small loans, total debt should
be greater in the Control condition than in the Debt Consolidation condition.
One hundred and two undergraduate students (60% female; mean age: 21.8) at a private
mid-Atlantic university participated in the experiment.

Results and Discussion
Mean total debt in both conditions was significantly greater than that of a financially
optimal player (both ps < .001), and more importantly, mean total debt was marginally greater in
the Control condition than in the Debt Consolidation condition ($38,649 vs. $37,063; t(100) =
1.83, p < .07). Thus, there was a large amount of suboptimal debt repayment behavior in both
conditions, but decreasing the temptation to close accounts by increasing distance to that subgoal
(in the Debt Consolidation condition) reduced this non-optimal behavior.
We also examined the repayment of the small debts (Debts 1-4) versus the consolidated
loan. A debt account-averse player in the Control condition would completely pay off Debts 1-4
by the end of round 6. Likewise, a debt account-averse player in the Debt Consolidation
condition would completely pay off the consolidated loan by the end of round 6. Participants
were significantly more likely to pay off Debts 1-4 by round 6 than to pay off the consolidated
loan by round 6 (12% vs. 2%; χ2(1) = 4.27, p < .05), suggesting that the debt consolidation
intervention discouraged people from focusing on closing out small loans. In addition, focusing
only on those who closed either Debts 1-4 or the consolidated loan, Control participants closed
Debts 1-4 significantly earlier than Debt Consolidation participants closed the consolidated loan

<-----Page 21----->22
(on average, round 10 vs. round 16; t(33) = 3.71, p < .001).
The benefits of debt consolidation are usually thought to consist of the reduced interest
paid on a consolidated loan relative to multiple loans, as well as the reduced transaction and
monitoring costs required to manage a single loan. Experiment 3 suggests that debt consolidation
can also reduce the harmful effects of debt account aversion. Although debt consolidation can be
costly, both directly (e.g., in the form of balance transfer fees) and indirectly (by reducing
perceived vulnerability to financial risks; Bolton, Bloom, and Cohen 2010), our results suggest
that debt consolidation may be more beneficial than previously thought. Specifically, by
eliminating consumers’ ability to repay small debts, debt consolidation appears to help refocus
attention on the overarching goal of reducing total debt.

EXPERIMENT 4: FOCUSING ATTENTION ON INTEREST

In Experiments 2 and 3, we utilized interventions that helped debt account-averse players,
but would slightly harm financially optimal players. In Experiment 4, we examined the
effectiveness of a more practical intervention, which would harm neither financially optimal nor
debt account-averse players. Specifically, we examined whether routinely highlighting the actual
dollar amount of interest accumulated by each debt, or the amount that could be accumulated in
the next round, helped participants to prioritize repayment of the highest-interest debts. Because
consumers have difficulty understanding how interest accumulates over time (e.g., Eisenstein
and Hoch 2005; Stango and Zinman 2009b), interest rates may play less of a role in repayment
decisions than they should (cf. Hsee 1996). Translating abstract rates into a more tangible and
familiar unit (dollar amounts) may increase the weight players place on interest rates (cf.

<-----Page 22----->23
Gigerenzer and Hoffrage 1995).
To some extent, existing elements of credit card statements are designed to help
consumers translate interest rates into dollar amounts. The “Minimum Payment Warning”
required since February 2010 to appear on U.S. credit card statements displays the total amount
of money (principal plus interest) that will ultimately be repaid if only minimum payments are
made each billing cycle. Credit card statements also include an Interest Charge Calculation
section that displays the total amount of interest accumulated during the previous billing period.
Thus, credit card statements highlight both prospective and retrospective monetary implications
of interest rates.
Accordingly, Experiment 4 manipulated whether participants were focused on the
amount of interest that could be accumulated in the future, the amount of interest accumulated to
date, or neither. Although the debt management game interface displays how the balance of each
debt changes over time, large period-to-period interest accumulations do not move the balance
lines dramatically because of the scale of the graph. Thus, drawing attention more explicitly to
the actual amount of interest paid may be beneficial.
We highlighted interest amounts with a pop-up box that appeared at the beginning of
each round. The box included a table whose content varied across three between-subjects
conditions (see Appendix C). Each table listed the debts that were still open, their amount, and
their interest rate. In the Control condition, the table contained no additional information. In the
Prospective condition, the table also reported “the amount by which each debt would increase
from this round to the next round, if you allocate no cash to that particular debt.” In other words,
participants learned the maximum amount of interest each debt could accumulate in the next
round. In the Retrospective condition, the table reported the total amount of interest each debt

<-----Page 23----->24
has accumulated over the course of the game. Below the table, the box also indicated the total
interest charges (across all debts) over the course of the game. In all conditions, participants
could click OK at any point to remove the box and make their decisions for that round. Aside
from the treatment differences in pop-up box content, all participants played the game in a
format identical to the Control condition of Experiment 3.
Seventy-five students (55% female; mean age: 22.6) at a private mid-Atlantic university
participated in the experiment.

Results and Discussion
Mean total debt was significantly greater than that of a financially optimal player in all
conditions (all ps < .001). However, total debt was lower in the Retrospective condition than in
the Control condition ($36,089 vs. $38,848; t(47) = 1.89, p < .07) and the Prospective condition
($36,089 vs. $38,672; t(49) = 1.78, p = .08). Total debt did not differ significantly between the
Control condition and Prospective condition (p = .91).
We also examined which Debts were paid off completely. Because of the minimal total
debt difference between the Prospective and Control conditions, we pool across those conditions
in this analysis. Participants in the Prospective and Control conditions were significantly more
likely to close Debt 1 (the smallest debt) than to close Debt 6 (the debt with the highest interest
rate) (76% vs. 48%; χ2(1) = 8.32, p < .01). However, participants in the Retrospective condition
were slightly less likely to close Debt 1 than to close Debt 6 (60% vs. 68%; χ2(1) = 0.08, p =
.77).
Thus, while the Retrospective intervention did not erase debt account aversion, it did help
to move repayment behavior in the direction of optimality. However, the Prospective

<-----Page 24----->25
intervention did not produce any beneficial effects. One reason why the Retrospective
intervention was more effective than the Prospective intervention may have been that the interest
figures were more alarming in the Retrospective condition. For example, at the beginning of
round 10, a debt account-averse player in the Retrospective condition will be told that Debt 6
(the debt with the highest interest rate) has already accumulated $25,399 in interest. By contrast,
at the beginning of round 10 in the Prospective condition, the debt account-averse player will
learn that the most interest Debt 6 could accrue in the next round is $3,416. If this is the case,
credit card statements could potentially be made more effective by reporting the total lifetime
amount of interest accumulated on the current balance (as opposed to simply the amount of
interest accrued since the previous billing cycle, as is the current practice).

GENERAL DISCUSSION

Many consumers hold many debts. The average U.S. credit user holds over five credit
cards, each with an average balance of over $1,000 (Experian 2009). Mortgages, car loans, and
student loans complicate matters further. Understanding how consumers manage these debt
portfolios could help inform interventions designed to help consumers repay debts more
efficiently. Moreover, a better understanding of these decisions is likely to become increasingly
important as consumers accumulate more debts during times of economic difficulty.
Understanding debt repayment strategies is also important for financial institutions, which could
better calculate the risk of unpaid loans by understanding how consumers manage multiple debts.
In this research we provided consistent evidence of debt account aversion. In three field
surveys and four experiments, consumers faced with multiple debts prioritized reducing the

<-----Page 25----->26
number of debt accounts over reducing the total amount of debt across accounts. That is, rather
than repaying the debts with the highest interest rates most quickly (the financially optimal
strategy), many consumers chose to repay the smallest debts as soon as possible. This suboptimal
behavior was observed among students financially motivated to behave optimally, viewers of a
financial news program, and consumers who have experience managing credit card debt.
We also examined ways to reduce debt account aversion. We found that eliminating
participants’ ability to completely pay off small debts actually improved their overall financial
situation. Consumers were more likely to repay high-interest debts when they did not have
enough money to fully repay any debt (Experiment 2), and when small debts were consolidated
into one large account (Experiment 3). We also found that a display that highlighted the total
amount of interest accumulated helped to focus consumers on repaying high-interest debts
(Experiment 4). Although none of these interventions should improve the financial situation of a
financially optimal consumer (and the manipulations in Experiments 2 and 3 should slightly
harm financially optimal consumers), they all improved the financial situation of the participants
in our experiments by disrupting their natural tendency to focus on repaying small loans. Of
course, it should be noted that while our interventions improved the optimality of debt repayment
decisions, the differences between conditions and the financially optimal benchmark were
generally greater than the differences between conditions. Thus, while there may be ways to
reduce the bias of repaying smaller loans first, fully extinguishing it may require more forceful
intervention – perhaps one where a consumer pays a central payment center, and this payment
center allocates payments to the different loans.

Limitations

<-----Page 26----->27
Like many laboratory paradigms, our paradigm is a simplified version of reality, designed
to capture only the most essential elements of debt management. To keep the game tractable and
the results interpretable, several complexities present outside the lab are not reflected in the
game. For example, players in our game could not accumulate new debt, and they never had to
choose between repaying debt and making a new purchase. Additionally, in real life there are
transaction and cognitive costs that accompany debts. In our game, repayment decisions for all
debts are made simultaneously each round. Outside the lab, bills for different debts arrive at
different times, with different payment due dates. Accordingly, closing small debts conveys
simplicity benefits (e.g., reduced paperwork) that are not fully reflected in the game. Outside the
lab, these simplicity benefits may strengthen debt account aversion.
Because our game is a vast simplification of the reality of debt management, it provides a
relatively simple setting for people to behave optimally. The finding that individuals use
repayment strategies that are far from ideal in our simplified game speaks to the intuitive appeal
of debt account aversion and suggests that debt repayment behavior in the more complex world
could be even more depressing. Indeed, our field surveys suggest that debt account aversion is
common response to multiple debts.

Is Debt Account Aversion Always a Mistake?
Although we have identified situations in which debt account aversion produces nonoptimal behavior, there may be other situations in which debt account aversion proves to be a
useful heuristic. As noted above, there were necessarily no opportunities for outside purchases in
the debt management game. When consumers must choose between repaying small debts and

<-----Page 27----->28
making a new purchase, debt account aversion may actually be beneficial, motivating consumers
to forego a new purchase in favor of repaying a small debt.
It is also important to note that the size of the debt accounts was positively correlated
with interest rates in our game. In the domain of credit cards, such a situation can occur if
consumers base their decision of which card to use on factors other than interest rates, such as
spending rewards or available credit. It can also occur when credit card companies unexpectedly
raise interest rates after purchases have already been made. Debt account aversion is only a
mistake when the correlation between debt size and interest rates is positive. When the
correlation is negative, debt account aversion may be a beneficial heuristic.

Open Questions and Future Directions
Future research should shed further light on the process(es) underlying debt account
aversion. We have proposed that the phenomenon is multiply determined, and indeed, robust
phenomena are often robust because they are multiply determined (Huettel and Payne 2009). In
particular, we have hypothesized that the goal-gradient effect (e.g., Kivetz, Urminsky, and Zheng
2006), the tendency to adopt subgoals when attempting to achieve a difficult superordinate goal
(e.g., Newell and Simon 1972), and the desire to avoid segregated losses (e.g., Thaler and
Johnson 1990), are likely to contribute to debt account aversion. We leave the important task of
examining the relative strength of each component for future research.
It is also important to determine whether consumers think that prioritizing repayment of
low-balance, low-interest loans over high-balance, high-interest loans is a financially optimal
strategy, or whether they realize that is objectively suboptimal, but pursue it anyway because
there are emotional benefits to paying off debt accounts. One way to address this question would

<-----Page 28----->29
be to compare the behavior of regular players in the debt management game to the behavior
(suggestions) of advisors who are paid based on their advisees’ ability to reduce total debt (cf.
Cain, Loewenstein, and Moore 2005). If consumers believe that debt account aversion is a
financially optimal strategy, there should be no difference between regular (non-advised) players
and advisors. That is, advisors should advise their clients to prioritize repayment of low-balance,
low-interest loans. However, if closing small accounts delivers emotional benefits that advisors
do not vicariously experience, advisors should behave more optimally.
It should be noted that debt account aversion is only one way in which consumers
mismanage their debts. For example, recent work has revealed that consumers tend to overweight minimum payment information when deciding how much to repay each month on their
credit cards (Salisbury and Lemon 2010; Stewart 2009), that they can be insufficiently sensitive
to interest rates when choosing between loans (Shu 2010), and that they often fail to transfer
balances from high-interest to low-interest debt accounts (Stango and Zinman 2009a). Future
work should continue to examine the ways in which consumers manage (and mismanage) their
debts.
Finally, beyond debt management, future work should also examine whether debt
account aversion influences purchasing behavior. For example, if a consumer is deciding
whether to put a new purchase on a credit card with no balance and a 5% APR or a credit card
with a $1,000 balance and a 10% APR, debt account aversion suggests that the consumer may
(non-optimally) use the latter. More broadly, debt account aversion may influence the proportion
of income consumers divert from new purchases (or savings and investments) toward debt
repayment.

<-----Page 29----->30
Final Thoughts
Financial guru Dave Ramsey (2009) suggests that consumers who are struggling to
manage multiple debts should pay off small debts first because they need “some quick wins in
order to stay pumped enough to get out of debt completely.” Our consistent evidence of debt
account aversion suggests that many consumers share Ramsey’s intuition. While this heuristic is
not necessarily a mistake, our work reveals that debt account aversion can systematically lead
consumers astray when larger debts have larger interest rates. Ultimately, it appears that debt
account aversion may enable consumers to win the battle, but lose the war against debt.

1
At first glance, it is difficult to reconcile debt account aversion with consumers’ tendency to hold
multiple debts. The phenomena become easier to reconcile when one considers that many consumers have
no choice but to hold multiple debts. Some debts are naturally separate, such as car loans and mortgages
that originate from different lenders. Additionally, consumers who struggle to make ends meet may open
multiple credit cards out of necessity once their existing cards have no more available credit. Beyond
necessity, there are often compelling immediate benefits to opening a new credit card account, such as
obtaining a retailer discount or a desired good.
It is worth highlighting that the non-optimal behavior observed in the $100 rebate condition is primarily
driven by participants’ attempts to close out the low-balance account, rather than by reliance on a 1/n
heuristic. Participants in the $100 rebate condition were significantly more likely to completely pay off
the low-APR card than to divide their rebate evenly across cards (29% vs. 2%; χ2(1) = 23.19, p < .0001).
 
3
Overall, participants repaid $47.06 on average to the low-APR account. This mean is considerably larger
than the corresponding mean in Field Survey 1 ($32.41), a difference that is likely attributable to
differences in financial sophistication across the two samples.
 
4
To help ensure that the evidence of debt account aversion observed in Field Surveys 1 and 2 was not
optimal, we conducted a follow-up survey with 33 financial professionals (e.g., loan officers, bank vice
presidents), who on average had six years of experience in their position. We gave them the $100 rebate
version of the debt repayment scenario and asked them how a typical consumer should behave. A
significant majority (79%) indicated that the entire rebate should be used to pay down the high-APR card
(p < .001, sign test), suggesting that debt account aversion is inconsistent with experts’ predominant view
of financially optimal behavior.
 
5
One possible alternative account is that R will be greater than D when participants equally spread their
repayments across all their debts (a 1/n heuristic). However, only five participants planned to pay the
same amount to each debt, and the comparison remains significant when those participants are excluded
from the analysis (0.25 vs. 0.14, t(37) = 3.31, p < .01, paired t-test). Minimum payments are also unlikely
to account for this phenomenon. If multiple-debt holders make only minimum payments, and different
creditors use similar formulas to determine minimum payments, R should equal D (since larger debts will
have larger minimum payments).
2

The initial order in which debts appeared in the Choose Debt drop-down box was counterbalanced
across participants, but debts were always numbered from smallest to largest, which might have
contributed to the debt account aversion observed in our experiments (if participants interpreted the debts’
numbers as suggestions for which debts to pay off first). However, we also observed debt account
aversion in our Field Surveys, suggesting that debt account aversion is not an artifact of our experimental
procedures.

6

Because the game changes over time (e.g., allocating money non-optimally in early rounds reduces the
opportunity to do so in later rounds), note that increases in optimal behavior over time could be driven by
two factors: learning and reduced opportunities to behave non-optimally. Future research could more
definitively address learning by examining knowledge transfer (e.g., by manipulating whether or not
participants initially play the current debt management game and then letting everyone play a new debt
management game, with different debts and interest rates).

NON-OPTIMAL BEHAVIOR OVER TIME
(EXPERIMENT 1)

The figure displays the mean proportion of money allocated non-optimally by round. Note that in
rounds 6, 12, and 19, participants received extra money (bonuses) to repay debts. For a debt
account-averse player, the bonuses are never large enough to completely pay off the open debt
with the highest interest rate, which may be why the bonuses did not produce large increases in
optimal behavior.

APPENDIX A
FINAL SCREEN OF DEBT MANAGEMENT GAME
FOR A FINANCIALLY OPTIMAL PLAYER

This screen displays the behavior of a (hypothetical) financially optimal player, who in each
round allocated all available cash to the open debt with the highest interest rate. In rounds in
which a debt was closed, but the player still had cash remaining, the remaining cash was
allocated to the debt with the next highest interest rate. This game was played under the rules of
the No-Saving condition in Experiment 1 (identical to the Control conditions of Experiments 3
and 4).

FOR A DEBT ACCOUNT-AVERSE PLAYER

smallest open debt as soon as possible. In each round, this player allocated all available cash to
the open debt with the smallest balance. In rounds in which a debt was closed, but the player still
had cash remaining, the remaining cash was allocated to the debt with the next smallest balance.
This game was played under the rules of the No-Saving condition in Experiment 1 (identical to
the Control conditions of Experiments 3 and 4).
