a great deal of attention has been devoted by corporate ® nance theory to understand
which devices and tools may favour the rise and development of these enterprises.
It is well known that small ® rms , unlike many large corporations, experience
problems in gaining access to ® nance capital at acceptable costs (Acs and
Audretsch, 1990; Hughes and S torey, 1994; Westhead and Storey, 1997). Innovative small ® rms ® nd it particularly dif® cult to meet their ® nancing needs through
traditional mechanisms (G ompers and L erner, 1999; Giudici and Paleari, 2000).
T his is due to a number of reasons : ® rst, by their nature, young small ® rms are
ass ociated with signi® cant levels of business uncertainty. S econd, asymmetric
information between the entrepreneur and the investors may lead to moral hazard
and adverse s election problems (Jensen and M eckling, 1976; M yers and Majluf,
1984). Then, most of these ® rms are overwhelmingly endowed with intangible and
s peci® c ass ets; therefore, their ris k of failure is higher than in traditional ® rms and
creates the potential for credit rationing. L as t, the supply of capital from investors
and its price may va ry dramatically due to m arket conditions.
Without any reference to the valuation of future growth opportunities and to the
effective allocation of funds, collateral s ecuring loans and personal warranties on
existing assets are clearly not adequate to ® nance the development of innovative
s tart-up ® rms. These ® rms need `patient capital’ (Caprio and S pisni, 1994), which
is expected to follow the innovative project life-cycle and the cash ¯ ows generation
pro® le. If s elf-® nancing is not ava ilable and external funds are needed, such ® rms
s hould res ort to equity ® nancing and, as a res ult, venture capital may be extremely
important in removing ® nancing obstacles.
Venture capital may be de® ned as a type of long-term equity capital provision
invested by external quali® ed agents in privately-held small or new companies,
typically operating in fast-growing sectors. Venture capitalis ts are actively involved
in the management of the ventures they ® nance and expect to realize a capital gain
by selling their shares when the company is well-establis hed. F igure 1 s ynthetically
depicts the venture capital process. The venture capitalist collects capital from
investors, and de® nes the target inves tments of the trust. Then, a ¯ ow of venture
proposals is originated: after a preliminary screening, among them the most
promising are carefully evaluated in terms of ris k and expected returns , and jus t a
few of them are effectively ® nanced. The negotiation between the venture capitalist
and the entrepreneur is con® rmed by a contract which de® nes terms and conditions
of the partnership. The contract is subject to continuous bargaining and haggles
over s everal control rights and options. The venture capitalis t purchas es a fraction of
the equity capital of the ® rm, and actively cooperates with the entrepreneur in
bus ines s managing. When the ® rm is well-establis hed, the venture capitalist exits
the investment via an IPO or a private placement, and the cas h is channelled to new
ventures or to the inves tors when the trus t is over.
Venture-backed entrepreneurs open to external parties in order to accelerate
growth (most of the time the dilemma is `grow or perish’) and increas e pro® tability
(S andri, 1994). They m ust accept the partial loss of voting and control power, s ince
the venture capitalist (VC) must be regularly informed on managerial decisions .
T he VC engages in active monitoring: his partners hip activity adds new value to the
venture by placing managerial and advis ing s kills at the ® rm’ s dis posal and
exploiting a network of relations hips with the bus ines s community.
Obviously VCs must overcome incentive and information problems in long-term
contracts governing venture funds (Gompers and L erner, 1999), which are critica l
to limiting opportunistic behaviour and ens uring allocation ef® ciency.

Figure 1. The Venture Capital cycle.
In this paper a model describing the agency relationship between the VC and
the entrepreneur (E) is proposed, taking into account that the VC’s monitoring
and advis ing activity adds new value to the participated ® rm. At the same time
it is assumed that the VC is time-cons trained and has to allocate his resources to
s everal investment opportunities. The trade-off between costs and bene® ts of
the monitoring activity is well known in the literature (the main existing
frameworks are des cribed in S ection 3), but a few models determining an
optimal level of involvement exist, with reference to the opportunity cost of VCs’
activity.
The ques tions addres sed are: how may be depicted the opportunity cost of the
VC’s activity and the private bene® ts enjoyed by the E? Is there an optimal staging
for ventures ’ ® nancing? Which are the determinants of the optimal solution ? Are
there con¯ icts between the VC and the E in determining an ef® cient strategy of the
monitoring activity?
This model quanti® es agency and monitoring costs and s olves the trade-off
between costs and bene® ts of the VC’s involvement (measured in terms of support
frequency and ® nancing rounds ) by maximizing the va lue of the s take held by the

<-----Page 3----->156

G. Giudic i a nd S. Palea ri

VC in the participated company net of the opportunity cost of time allocated to the
s am e ® rm.
The opportunity cost of the time spent on ® rms’ advis ing depends both on
the renunciation to consider a new investment proposal, and on the loss of its
potential value. In other words, the model derives the optimal frequency of
® nancing/monitoring considering endogenous costs, and the optimal venture
duration.
The manner in which control is treated here is quite different from other
authors. In our framework control is subject to bargaining every time the VC
monitors the ® rm. When the VC is far from the ® rm (involved in other ventures ’
cons ulting) the E has control power on the enterprise and extracts priva te bene® ts .
As the VC turns his attention to the E and capital is infused, the investor has the
power to actively in¯ uence the business management (adding new value) or, in
extreme circumstances to abandon the venture.
By the fact that the bene® ts of va lue creation are s hared by the E and by the VC
in proportion to their stake, while the opportunity cos ts of monitoring are borne by
the VC only, we claim that a con¯ ict of interest aris es between the VC and the E,
broadened by the fact that the E may extract priva te bene® ts from the business to
the VC’s detriment.
The model s hows that, considering this con¯ ict of interest, the VC’s optimal
duration of the investment is lower than wished by the E. T his seems quite
unrealis tic, s ince mostly entrepreneurs appear to res is t efforts by VCs to control
their ® rms (Hellmann, 1998), even if they welcome the money that comes. Yet, the
model does not predict that Es want more control, but that they jus t want a longer
venture. In fact, the model posits that the VC is encouraged to maintain the venture
for a s horter period, i.e. the divestment will be anticipa ted with respect to the E’ s
desire. This result is consistent with previous empirical evidence (S andri, 1994).
Additionally, it is possible to show that the con¯ ict of interest is stronger in ® rms
which experience a faster decline of value creation without the VC’s involvement
(for example, younger and less experienced ® rms), and tends to be mitigated in
mature ® rms . This result is consis tent with S apienza (1992), who s tates that the
con¯ ict of interest between VCs and Es is stronger in young and innovative ® rms.
Obviously, the mis alignment between the VC’s and the E’ s goals emphasizes the
problem of determining which level of involvement is globally ef® cient. The VC’s
preference is driven by the optimal allocation of a scarce resource (time) between
s earching new investments and monitoring exis ting ventures , which determines a
globally ef® cient solution. It is shown that the optimal frequency of monitoring is
higher, the less the alternative proposals to be ventured on the market, the larger the
agency costs (in terms of private bene® ts ), the va lue of growth opportunity, the risk
of the business .
F inally, an optimal portfolio strategy for the VC is derived, in terms of number
of ® nanced ventures . It is s hown that the higher the VC’s ability to ® nd new va luable
proposals to be ventured and his capability to cultiva te the promising business , the
more the ventures adopted in the portfolio.
The res t of the paper is divid ed into four s ections. The theoretical background
and the main empirical res ults offered by the existing literature about agency costs
in venture capital ® nancing are pres ented in Section 2. In S ection 3 some related
models from the literature are reviewed, which s peci® cally feature the meting out of
® nancing in discrete stages over time and the VC’s monitoring and funding strategy.
T he model and its assumptions are described in S ection 4, even though we report

most of the mathematical notation in the Appendix, in order to emphas ize the
economic implications of our framework. F inally, S ection 5 reports the main
implications of the framework and some concluding remarks.

2. The Agency Relations hip between VCs and Entrepreneurs
Venture capital ® nancing may be interpreted as an agency relation between the VC
(the principa l) and the E (the agent), the latter selling to the former a s take of his
s tarting-up enterprise. T his transaction is governed by long-term contractual
provisions.
VCs typically concentrate in indus tries with a great deal of uncertainty, where
the information gap among Es and investors is commonplace. Therefore, information as ymmetries and moral haza rd provoke agency cos ts , related to the E’ s
opportunis tic behaviour. F irst, Es might inves t in projects that have high pers onal
returns and priva te bene® ts but low expected monetary payoffs. S imilarly, they have
the incentive to purs ue high-varia nce s trategies since they claim a call option on the
equity capital (G ompers and L erner, 1999).
Jens en and M eckling (1976) s how that agency costs may affect the willingness of
outside inves tors to provid e capital, s ince the E has an incentive to extract priva te
bene® ts . Myers and Majluf (1984) demonstrate that equity capital is more likely to
be offered when the ® rm is overvalued, if the E is better informed about the
investment opportunities of the ® rms.
On the contrary, if information asymmetries did not exis t, the E would maximize
s hareholders’ va lue, and the ® nancing strategy would be irrelevant. Similarly, if the
VC were able to control the E’ s behaviour without any additional cost, he could s top
the ® nancing process and give up the venture if not pro® table. Yet, monitoring
activities are costly and any opportunistic behaviour has to be tackled.
More generally, external ® nancing is cos tly if investors are not able to dis tinguis h
between competent (and hones t) entrepreneurs and incompetent (and opportunist)
ones (Hart and Moore, 1990). The VC is aware that innovative s tart-up ® rms
s upported by VCs are likely to face exactly this type of problems: he s eeks to
mitigate the con¯ ict of interest by de® ning proper contractual devices and covenants (Admati and P¯ eiderer, 1994; Barney et a l., 1994) and s creening mechanisms
(Chan, 1983). In fact, the VC provides active monitoring and advice (Sahlman,
1990; Hellmann, 1998). T he direct involvement of the inves tors in the ® rms’
management is indeed the competitive adva ntage of venture capital ® nancing
(S apienza and Amason, 1993), and it is often meas ured by the literature in terms
of frequency of interactions between the VC and the E and time devoted to the
s ingle ventures .
The level of interaction itself depends on the characteris tics of the venture,
namely the agency risks , the degree of uncertainty and the VC’s past experience.
The empirical evidence shows that VCs are likely to intens ify their monitoring
activity when ris k increas es and information is uncertain (Gompers and L erner,
1999); they will als o avoid s ector and geographical diversi® cation (Sapienza and
Gupta, 1994). As a cons equence of the time constraint, VCs will maximize the rate
of return of the time allocated to venture screening (Gorman and S ahlman, 1989).
The VC s elects the ® rms to be ® nanced through a systematic decision process
(Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; F reid and Hisrich, 1994; M eyer and Za charakis , 1997),
for he has to optimally allocate his time and energy among s everal activities:
s creening and evaluating new business proposals , negotiating the contracts for

<-----Page 5----->158

G. Giudic i a nd S. Palea ri

new ventures, monitoring the existing ventures , placing the success ful ones on the
s tock market. The phase of ® rms’ monitoring and advis ing is s urely the most
critical, since on average it takes up 60% of the VC’s time (F reid and Hisrich,
1994). Therefore, VCs are obliged to de® ne an objective market and, by specializing
and settling s trict valuation criteria (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984), they are able to
s upport a restricted number of homogeneous ventures . T his is exactly the opposite
s trategy of traditional `pas sive’ inves tors, who are stimulated by information
asymmetries to diversify their portfolios in order to reduce risk. Diversi® cation
and direct involvement are alternative strategies: the ® rst may be successful, but it
implies giving up high yields ; the second (i.e. the venture capital approach) is bas ed
on the ability to s elect and `cultivate’ winning business and to transform the
knowledge and experience into va luable advis ing.
Typically, VCs provide equity through stage-® nancing: the business ’ s ituation
are veri® ed recurrently and ® nance is gradually supplied. Stage-® nancing is often
the most important monitoring device (S ahlman, 1990), for it allows the VC to
gather information and maintain an exit option. S taged capital infusion, like debt in
highly leveraged ® rms , keeps the E on a `tight leash’ and reduces potential loss from
bad decis ions (Gompers and L erner, 1999). Each time capital is infus ed, contracts
are renegotiated, reports are generated and other associated costs are incurred: this
is the reason why funding will occur in discrete stages. Therefore, it is worth
analysing if an optimal strategy of ® nancing rounds does exist.

3. Related Research
T he choice of the optimal level of involvement in ventures’ monitoring and
® nancing is strongly related to the characteris tics of the business (i.e. the nature
of the ® rm’ s ass ets, the level of R&D expenses , the va lue of growth opportunities).
T he choice depends on the magnitude of agency costs and on the VC’s ability to
add new value through advis ing and managing s upport. VCs s hould weigh potential
agency and monitoring costs when determining how frequently they s hould reevaluate projects and supply capital (Gompers , 1995; Gompers and L erner, 1999).
Empirical evidence con® rms that increases in as set tangibility increase ® nancing
duration and reduce monitoring intensity; as the role of future investment opportunities increases, ® rms are re® nanced more frequently. Gompers and L erner
(1999) als o provide evidence that in periods when the VC is able to raise more
capital for new investments , he invests more money per round and more frequently
in the portfolio ® rms.
Admati and P¯ eiderer (1994) de® ne the VC as a well-informed ® nancial
intermediary, able to avoid agency-related problems in risky investments. This
s tatement is bas ed on the hypothesis that the VC’s monitoring activity is not costly:
on the contrary, the opportunity cost of the VC’s time should not be neglected.
Chan (1983) states that the VC bears costs related to the collection of information,
but these costs are not continuously dis tributed in time, since, once the information
is disposable, it may circulate among all inves tors without further costs. It is argued
that the VC’s activity in ® rms ’ monitoring is time-consuming, and because time is
limited opportunity costs arise related to other ventures’ monitoring or new
proposals ’ eva luating. Gompers (1995) takes into account the trade-off between
costs and bene® ts of the monitoring activity, but in his model costs are exogenous
and do not depend on alternative inves tments . On the contrary, we hypothesize that

<-----Page 6----->Venture Ca pital Fina nc ing

159

monitoring costs are endogenous and are related to the renouncm ent of new
ventures ’ funding.
Cooper and Carleton (1979) introduce a dis crete-time model in which at every
round the VC may decide either to maintain or to abandon the venture. They derive
the optimal allocation of cas h ¯ ows between the principal and the agent, but again
they do not cons ider opportunity costs and time constraints . Chan et a l. (1990)
pres ent a model in which the opportunity costs of capital are ® xed and the VC can
ass ume the control of the venture only by a take-over, since no abandoning option is
admitted. A different framework is pres ented by Amit et a l. (1990), who consider
the VC as an external investor bearing agency costs of adverse selection, but only in
the phas e of the proposals’ evaluation; again, no opportunity costs exis t in the postinvestment phas e. S ahlman (1990) posits that ® rms characterized by a s igni® cant
value of growth opportunities exhibit not negligible agency costs, which may be
mitigated by intens e monitoring and thus by increasing the frequency of stage® nancing. He also highlights the role of s cale economies and learning effects on
venture ® nancing cos ts: on one hand the VC is encouraged to enlarge the number of
ventures , whilst on the other hand inef® ciencies may arise in the allocation of the
limited time among all the ® rms. Sapienza (1992) reports that, in the las t few years,
VCs have aimed at investing in mature business, in which the marginal va lue of
advis ing activity is lower. This is in order to shorten the time devoted to monitoring
and adopt a larger number of business proposals.
Hellmann (1998), in his two-staged model, as sumes that the E enjoys priva te
bene® ts from running the company and may relinquis h control in favour of the VC
at the end of the ® rst period. He predicts that the s maller the E’ s equity s take and
the more wealth cons trained the E, the more likely is VC control. This model, like
Chan et a l. (1990), depicts control as a binary variable. Yet, control rights in venture
capital contracts can have in® nite gradations and repeated renegotiations (Gompers , 1997). It is hypothesized that control is s ubject to bargaining every time the
® rm is ® nanced: when the VC is actively involved in monitoring the ® rm, he is able
to in¯ uence the management through capital infus ion contracting. In the following
periods, up to the VC’s next cons ulting round, control is held by the E, who can
engage in private bene® ts extraction. Our as sumption is consistent with Gorman
and S ahlman (1989), who s how that usually the VC does not become involved in
the day-to-day management of the ® rm: major reviews of progress and extensive due
diligence are con® ned to the time of re® nancing and are des igned to limit
opportunis tic behaviour by Es .

4. The Model
The aim of this section is to develop a model which, taking into account agency and
opportunity costs , determines the VC’s optimal level of involvement, in terms of
frequency and number of ® nancing and monitoring rounds , by maximizing the
expected return of time and capital investments. We also attempt to unders tand if
there is any misalignment of objectives between the VC and the E, and, more in
general, if the VC’s choice of time allocation is s ocially ef® cient.
In s hort, we face three iss ues: the determinants of the VC’s choice, the optimal
number of ventures held in his portfolio, the coherence between the VC’s and the
E’ s optimal choices.

4.1. The Assum ptions
T he de® nition of the optimal level of involvement implies that (in order to maximize
the value of the venture) periodica l monitoring is preferable to non-intervention,
that is the difference between the VC and a simple underwriter.
It is hypothesized that the VC’s portfolio cons ists of s everal ventures, each one
requiring periodical intervention by the VC himself; the length of s ubsequent
cons ulting rounds is ass umed to be homogeneous, i.e. the time span between two
interventions in the s ame ® rm is constant, and equally dis tributed among the
different ventures (s ee F igure 2). At the beginning of each round, the VC actively
monitors and supports the ® rm and decides whether to go on ® nancing or to
abandon the venture. The VC adopts a specialization strategy in order to optimally
exploit his competencies; as a cons equence, we as sume that the participated ® rms
are ehomogeneous and the VC holds an equity stake equal to ¬ in each of them.
T hese are not topic assumptions , but they are us eful to s implify the notation. The
model could be easily generalized by considering heterogeneous ® rms and different
levels of ¬ across ® rms and time.
In the model, time is divided in subs equent periods, which represent the time
unit. L et c (F igure 2) be the time span (in terms of number of periods) between two
s ubsequent interventions in the same ® rm and measures the frequency of interventions. Then let t be the number of consulting rounds in every venture held in the
portfolio. T hus , the VC’s activity time (i.e. the fund duration) is equal to T ˆ c t
and is divid ed in t rounds made up by c periods.
F inally, in order to explicitly cons ider the time constraint, it is as sumed that in
every period the VC is able to monitor only one ® rm (s ee F igure 3); in particular, he
may decide to devote himself to an exis ting venture, or to evaluate a new proposal
for poss ible inclusion in the fund.
Note what may happen during every round (F igure 3). In period i ˆ 1
of round j ˆ 1 the VC decides whether to adopt a new ® rm; in the other periods
of the round the remaining ventures will be monitored. After the evaluation process ,
a new proposal will be ® nanced with probability «0 …0 µ «0 µ 1 †, otherwise it will be
rejected; this implies that at the end of the ® rst round the ventures held by the VC
will be N with N µ c. In fact, as each ® rm is cons ulted every c periods, the VC will
be able to hold a maximum of c ventures . Since the period is a ® xed single time unit,
if the frequency of the VC’s intervention in each venture increas es, the monitoring
rounds will get inevitably s horter, and equally the maximum N will get lower.
Now cons ider two ventures (A and B) and s uppose that in the following round
only ® rm A will be maintained in the portfolio, whereas ® rm B will be abandoned.

In period i ˆ 1 of round j ˆ 2 the VC decides to go on ® nancing venture A and
s pends his time on monitoring it; then in period i ˆ 2 of the same round he stops
providing capital to ® rm B and has the possibility to ® nance a new proposal, and so
on. Notice that among all the ventures held in the ® rst round, only some of them
(the promising ones) will be ® nanced for the second round. Namely, a probability
«…0 µ « µ 1† that the venture will be maintained at the beginning of every
monitoring period exists . Obviously, the number N of ventures held in the portfolio
depends on « and «0 : the variable c represents an upper bound, which can be
reached if no time is allocated to the valuation of new ventures and no enterprises
are abandoned.
Note again that control is depicted as a continuous va riable which is subject of
bargaining every time new capital is infused in the venture.

4.2. The VC’ s Objec tiv e Func tion
The VC periodically consults the E in order to verify the actual growth opportunities
and advis e the managers. The more frequent his interventions, the higher will be the
value added to the venture, but also the higher will be the opportunity cost of time
diverted from the evaluation of new entrepreneurial proposals. Thus, in our model
the VC will choose the optimal monitoring strategy (c ) and the number of ® nancing
rounds (t) considering the trade-off between opportunity costs and the maximization of the ® rms ’ value. L et V be the pres ent va lue of the ® rm to be ventured if the

is reasonable to as sume that the ® rm will bene® t from the monitoring activity not
only when the VC is directly monitoring the ® rm, but also in all the s ubsequent
periods until the next round.
However, it is hypothesized that the contribution to va lue creation is at its
maximum level when the VC is directly monitoring the ® rm , while it gradually
declines in the following periods, when the VC is involved in the valuation of other
ventures (because of the agency costs ). L et R 0 be the maximum value increase
relatively to a single period, and suppose that when the VC is not monitoring the
® rm, the va lue growth diminishes (as provided by S apienza and Amason, 1993;
S apienza et a l., 1996) at a rate equal to ® …® < 1 †. T herefore (s ee F igure 4) during

At the beginning of every round, the VC may either give up the venture or go on
® nancing the development; we hypothes ize that this second alternative realizes with
a probability equal to « and that in this latter cas e the condition of maximum value
creation R0 will be re-establis hed.
It is als o ass umed that the VC’s decisions are independently dis tributed across
time, and therefore the probability that the venture is not yet rejected at the second
round (given that it has been adopted in the ® rst round) is «, at the third round is «2
and so on. The probability that the venture is in the portfolio after t rounds is «t¡1 .
Then, the expected ® rm’ s va lue creation after t rounds will be «t ¡1 tP c , namely the
value creation after t rounds …tP c † times the probability to maintain the venture.
Taking into account a dis count rate per period ­ …­ < 1†, we may now compute the
pres ent value creation V …c ;t †:
Ri ˆ ® i ¡1 R0 ˆ ­ c t …«t¡1 tP c †
This va lue will accrue to the VC proportionally to his fraction V …c ;t † of the equity
capital:
¬V …c ;t † ˆ ¬­ c t «t ¡1 tP c

The VC is a time-constraint agent; he s pends his time monitoring and advis ing
existing ventures and evaluating new business proposals . T his implies that an
opportunity cost of time arises , related to the possibility of adopting a new pro® table
® rm. This cost may be express ed as the expected loss of a potential inves tment,
namely ¬W …c ;t †, times the probability «0 that the alternative proposal is included in
the portfolio. It may be argued that the VC could eas e these cons traints by hiring
additional as sociates or partners. In every cas e this would be costly (in terms of
training and competencies) and our model could be easily generalized by trading off
these costs agains t the expected bene® ts.
The VC may not cons ider an alternative venture until all the other ® rms in the
portfolio are ® nanced. Thus, the opportunity cost pers ists for s < t rounds only if
any existing venture outlived for s ¡1 rounds ; s ince this happens with a probability
equal to «s¡1 , the expected opportunity cost will be ¬W …c ;t †«0 «s¡1 ; again, taking

Notice that there exis ts a maximum, in correspondence to the couple …c VC 0 ;t VC 0 †;
thus, the VC will choose these parameters to de® ne the frequency of ventures ’
monitoring and the number of ® nancing rounds .
How can the existence of an optimal solution be interpreted? If the VC increas ed
the frequency of monitoring too much …c VC < c VC 0 †, he would loose other opportunities of investments; nevertheles s, if he decreased the frequency …c VC > c VC 0 †,
agency cos ts and private bene® ts would prevail agains t va lue creation. M oreover, if
the VC maintained the venture for too many rounds …t VC > t VC 0 †, the risk of failure
(and therefore the opportunity costs) would increas e. By exiting too early
…tVC < tVC 0 † he would renounce most of the creation of new va lue.
4.3. The Entrepreneur’s Objec tiv e Function
L et us now consider the E’ s point of view. Admati and P¯ eiderer (1994) state
that the VC’s active involvement in managing ® rms may eliminate information
asymmetries and thus agency costs. In such a case the VC’s objective would
be aligned with the E’ s one. However, in a more conservative manner we
ass ume that the monitoring activity attenuates agency costs without eliminating
them, and moreover that the E is able to extract private bene® ts from the ® rm (for
example through on-the-job consumption) which lower the inves tors’ portfolio
value.
L et B i be the monetary amount of private bene® ts consumed during period i.
During the activity of ventures ’ m onitoring, the VC is able to control information

4.4. The Rela tionship Between the Pa ra meters a nd the Optim a l Solution
Once the optimal choices for the two agents have been determined, it is interesting
to es tablis h the relationship between the optimal solution and the parameters above
in order to ® nd a theoretical interpretation of the empirical res ults highlighted in the
0 , ® xed
literature. In the Appendix we derive the VC’s optimal number of rounds c VC
t (we now ass ume that the venture’ s duration is contractually ® xed, and the optimal
number of interventions has to be determined). The propositions below are proved
in the Appendix too:
0
Proposition I: c VC
increa ses a s «0 inc rea ses. This implies that, if the VC has several
opportunities to evaluate alternative ventures to be ® nanced, his opportunity cost of
time will increase, and therefore the frequency of intervention in the portfolio’ s
venture will decreas e. This res ult is consis tent with Gompers (1996), who states that

when he is far from the ® rm, his interventions s hould be more frequent. G ompers
(1995) and G ompers and L erner (1999) report higher frequency of monitoring in
® rms characterized by large R&D expenses and high Market-to-Book ratios, i.e.
high value of future growth opportunity. These ® rms are usually s ubject to the
appropriation of control bene® ts and agency costs , which may be more eas ily
inhibited by the VC’s intervention. F igure 8 shows the relationship between ® and

opportunity cost of capital and market momentum. The more risky the business, the
more frequent the VC’s intervention will be. S apienza (1994) s hows a positive
correlation between the VC’s efforts and the ris k of the busines s in terms of sector
and age. Gompers (1995) underlines that a correlation als o exis ts with the
proportion of intangible as sets and with the investments’ s peci® city, both increas ing
the business potentia l loss and, thus, the risk. F igure 9 shows the relationship

Proposition IV: t VC
decrea ses a s «0 increa ses a nd is independent from ® . The optimal
number of consulting rounds offered by the VC decreases as other investment
opportunities increas e. Therefore, if the competition on the market among different
proposals to be ventured is high, the VC’s opportunity cost arises and the ® nancing
rounds are reduced.

4.5. The Compa rison Between the VC’s a nd the E’ s Optim a l Choic es
In the Appendix the different optimal levels of c and t desired by the two agents are
compared and we point out a con¯ ict of interests whose determinants it is
interesting to analys e:
0 is a lwa ys sma ller tha n t 0 . Since the term in brackets is always lower
Proposition V: t VC
E
than 1 (it is equal to 1 only if t ! 1), the s maller is the time horizon, the stronger is
the con¯ ict of interests.

As a cons equence, the VC’s optimal number of consulting rounds (given their
frequency) is always smaller than what the E expects. Thus, the venture will be
dives ted prematurely with respect to the E’ s optimal choice, becaus e of the opportunity cos ts of alternative investments borne by the VC. This feature may seem quite
unrealis tic, since mostly Es appear to resent efforts by VCs. Nevertheless , our model
just predicts that Es want a longer venture, not more control from the VCs. S ince
the E can enjoy private bene® ts as long as the VC is involved in other ventures ’
monitoring, he desires the venture to go on as long as the VC adds va lue to the ® rm.

<-----Page 16----->Venture Ca pital Fina nc ing

169

In this vein, Sandri (1994) s hows that venture-backed ® rms generally go public
when they are younger and les s developed than other ® rms. This may happen
because the VC exits the inves tment earlier than des ired by the E:
Proposition VI: The intensity of the con¯ ic t of interests between the VC a nd the E inc rea ses
a s ® increa ses. The faster is the decline of the va lue added by the VC, the more
valuable is his monitoring activity; the cost of a miss ed intervention is borne more by
the VC (who loses a fraction 1 ¡ ® of the expected va lue creation) than by the E
(who, by contras t, may more eas ily extract private bene® ts, and thus loses a lower
fraction of va lue equal to …1 ¡ x†…1 ¡ ® ††. The marginal return of the monitoring
activity is higher for the VC and this effect is broadened if ® is low (or if x is high).
This res ult is con® rmed by S apienza (1992) who hypothesizes intense con¯ icts
between Es and VCs in young ® rms, in which the VC’s intervention is va luable.
4.6. The VC’ s optima l portfolio
Up to now we have hypothesized that the VC is time-cons trained and he is able to
monitor a single ® rm during each period. Therefore, the choice of an optimal
monitoring s trategy determines an upper bound for the number of ® rms to be
ventured during every round and for the VC’s portfolio investments.
Since the VC’s activity includes the va luation of new investment opportunities,
the number of ventures participated in by the VC depends on the rounds ’ length,
but also on the parameters «0 and «, i.e. the probability that a new busines s proposal
is effectively ® nanced and the probability that a venture will be maintained in the
portfolio, respectively. In every period, the number of the ventures held in the
portfolio will be a s tochas tic va lue, but it is possible to determine an expected value
N:
N ˆ cº1 ˆ

c«0
1 ¡ « ‡ «0

…11†

Notice that if « and «0 tend to 1, N tends to the upper bound c : this means that this
limit is more eas ily reachable if the ef® ciency of the screening process increases and
the adopted business is s ucces sful. In other words , the model s tates that the more
capable is the VC, the more ventures he will be able to hold. M oreover, this limit
will be lowered by increasing the frequency of interventions .
F igure 10 shows the relationship between N and the parameters « and «0 .
Remarkably, «0 loses relevance if « tends to 1; in fact, if the VC does not exercise the
option to abandon the venture …« ! 1 †, his ability to ® nd new good proposals will
not be valuable. By contras t, if the option may be eas ily exercised, the number of
ventures held in the portfolio will be high only if the VC is able to discover other
alternative investments. At worst, if « tends to 0, N will be equal to c =2. In this
s ituation all the ventured ® rms will be maintained for one round only and will be
abandoned at the following intervention: therefore the VC will be obliged to allocate
half of his time to the valuation of new proposals.

5. Concluding Remarks
The model pres ented in this paper provides a theoretical background for the
empirica l evidence regarding the activities of VCs highlighted in the literature.

of « and «0 .

Agency ris ks , investment uncertainty and past experience do have a role in
determining the optimal VC’ s monitoring strategy.
In new ® rms (characterized by high growth rate) Es are often encouraged to
pursue priva te bene® ts and therefore agency costs are particularly high. T he more
intangible and speci® c are the ® rms ’ assets as in the cas e of Internet-related
bus ines ses), the lower will be their carcas s value and thus the higher will be their
ris k. These factors all determine an increas e in the frequency of VCs’ monitoring
activity. On the contrary, expert VCs bear high opportunity costs in allocating time
and tend to reduce their interventions in the ventured ® rms .
Due to the con¯ ict of interests between VCs and Es, the latter may be unsatis® ed
by the monitoring and ® nancing s trategies chosen by the VCs. This happens
because the VCs trade-off opportunity cos ts and bene® ts of their time allocated
to the ® rms . The bene® ts, in terms of va lue added, are equally divid ed between the
two agents , whereas the costs are incurred only by the VCs. Moreover, Es do extract
private bene® ts to the VCs’ detriment.
The model shows that, under these as sumptions, a mis alignment between the
two agents ’ interests occurs, in s pite of the contract of risk sharing through equity
s ubscribing. The opportunity cost of the VC’s activity is depicted by cons idering the
value of alternative ventures to be ® nanced, and the potential risk of failure (i.e.
abandoning the venture). T he priva te bene® ts enjoyed by the E are represented as a
fraction of the decline in value creation experienced when the VC is far from the
® rm. We trade off costs against bene® ts of the VC’s monitoring activity both for the
VC himself and the E. The model concludes that both the number of ® nancing/

<-----Page 18----->Venture Ca pital Fina nc ing

171

monitoring rounds offered by the VCs and the venture duration are lower than
desired by the Es. Besides , the more va luable the VCs’ intervention (for example,
consider new technology-based ® rms), the more signi® cant the objectives’
divergence.
The effects of several determinants (such as the risk of the business , the expected
agency costs, the value of growth opportunities ) in the model are endogenized ,
s howing in a comparative-static pers pective their effects on the optimal ® nancing
and monitoring policy. In particular, we show that the VC’s intervention is more
frequent, the less the alternative pro® table ventures to be cons idered, the higher the
expected agency costs, the more ris ky the busines s (in terms of intangible assets and
ris k of failure). Thus, it is argued that the duration of the venture itself is
conditioned by the factors above: in particular the VC is induced to shorten the
® nance s taging if his opportunity cos ts arise. Als o by relating the number of ® rms to
be ventured in the VC’s portfolio to these factors, it can be seen that the higher the
VC’s ability to ® nd new valuable proposals to be ventured and his capability to
cultiva te the promis ing bus ines s equals more ® nanced ventures.
The res ults obtained are strongly related to earlier empirica l research on venture
capital contracts and ® nancing strategies. We believe that the model contains s ome
innovative features , mainly related to the formalization of agency and opportunity
costs and to the treatment of control rights. We also believe that other steps forward
in the theoretical depiction of the venture ® nancing process can be made by
modifying some ass umptions in the model by endogenizing some parameters. F or
example, the probability of abandoning the venture may be related to the VC’s
bargaining power, or the ratios ­ and ® may be expressed as a function of the ® rm’ s
ass ets and characteris tics (s ector, risk, intangibles, information asymmetry). The
® rms could als o be ass umed not to be homogenous in terms of risk and value. Then,
the time cons traints that limit the VC in fully monitoring the ® rm may be explicitly
derived from a market equilibrium. F inally, the analys is could be developed by
deeply considering the phas es of ventures selecting and divesting, which, in our
model, are not directly taken into account.

Proof of Equa tion ( 11) . We now derive the expected number of ventures held in the
VC’s portfolio, N . L et A be a c £ 1 vector whose elements a j are equal to 1 if at leas t
one ® rm included in the portfolio j periods before is still ® nanced in the current
period, and 0 otherwise. The number of ventured ® rms N is cons equently:
N ˆ

After every round, the j-element of vector A may va ry following a s tochastic process .
Applying matrix algebra the above M arkov process converges in the long-run to an
equilibrium des cribed by the probability dis tribution º…a j †:
