<-----Page 0----->Attracting Early Stage Investors: Evidence from a Randomized
Field Experiment
SHAI BERNSTEIN, ARTHUR KORTEWEG, and KEVIN LAWS*

ABSTRACT
This paper uses a randomized field experiment to identify which start-up
characteristics are most important to investors in early stage firms. The
experiment randomizes investors’ information sets of fund-raising start-ups. The
average investor responds strongly to information about the founding team, but
not to firm traction or existing lead investors. We provide suggestive evidence
that team is not merely a signal of quality, and that investing based on team
information is a rational strategy. Altogether, our results indicate that information
about human assets is causally important for the funding of early stage firms, and
hence, for entrepreneurial success.

<-----Page 1----->Early stage investors provide financial capital to young entrepreneurial firms, enabling their birth
and development, and thus contributing to innovation and growth in the economy (Solow
(1957)). Start-up firms are particularly difficult to finance because their prospects are highly
uncertain, they lack tangible assets that can be used as collateral, and they face severe
information problems (Hall and Lerner (2010)). Given these problems, how do investors choose
which start-ups to fund? What factors drive their selection process? While this issue is often
debated among academics and practitioners (e.g., Quindlen (2000), Gompers and Lerner (2001)),
there is little systematic evidence on the selection process of early stage investors. This stands in
sharp contrast to the wealth of evidence on investment decisions in public equity markets by
institutional and retail investors.1 This paper provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first
experimental evidence of the causal impact of start-up characteristics on investor decisions.
Based on competing theories of the firm, we focus on three key characteristics of startups: the founding team, the start-up’s traction (such as sales and user base), and the identity of
current investors. The founding team is important if human assets are the critical resource that
differentiates one start-up from another, as argued by Wernerfelt (1984), Rajan and Zingales
(2001), and Rajan (2012). The importance of experimentation at the earliest stages of the firm
further highlights the special role of the founding team (e.g., Schumpeter (1934), Kerr, Nanda
and Rhodes-Kropf (2014), and Manso (2015)). Alternatively, the property rights theories of
Grossman and Hart (1986), and Hart and Moore (1990), amongst others, suggest that it is the
non-human assets that are most important. Investors should then react most strongly to firm
traction in order to identify early signs of the underlying idea’s success. A third possibility is that
investors prefer to rely mostly on the behavior of other, earlier investors, rather than on their own
information, especially when earlier investors are high profile and successful. Such behavior may

2

<-----Page 2----->arise in various settings with information asymmetry and may lead to information cascades
(Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992), and Welch (1992)). In these cases, investors pay
most attention to the identity of existing investors.
Testing these hypotheses is challenging because it is difficult to separate the causal
effects of different start-up characteristics. For example, are serial entrepreneurs more likely to
attract financing due to their past experience, or because they tend to start companies that look
attractive on other dimensions known to the investor but not to the researcher, such as the
underlying business idea? This omitted variables problem is exacerbated by the fact that existing
data sources for start-ups contain only a small fraction of investors’ information sets at the time
of funding. Moreover, existing data sets include only completed deals rather than the entire pool
of start-ups considered by investors. Without data on the characteristics of companies that were
turned down by investors, it is difficult to learn about investors’ decision-making process.
To address these problems, we conduct a randomized field experiment on AngelList, an
online platform that matches start-ups with potential investors. AngelList regularly sends emails
to investors featuring start-ups that are raising capital. Besides broad information about the startup idea and funding goal, the emails show specific information on the founding team, the startup’s traction, and the identity of current investors, but only if the specific information passes a
disclosure threshold set by AngelList. Investors therefore perceive a given dimension of the firm
(team, traction, or current investors) as low quality if the corresponding information category is
missing from the email.
In the experiment, we randomly choose which of the categories that passed AngelList’s
disclosure threshold are revealed in a given email. We thus exogenously change investors’
perception of the quality of a start-up’s team, traction, and current investors. Conditional on

3

<-----Page 3----->other information that is provided about the start-up, we exploit the variation across investors’
reactions within each start-up to infer which factors drive investors’ decisions. Specifically, we
measure each investor’s level of interest in the company by recording whether the investor
chooses to learn more about the firm on the platform. This allows us to explore the impact of
information on investors’ initial screening process.
We sent approximately 17,000 emails to nearly 4,500 investors on the platform, spanning
21 different start-ups, during the summer of 2013. The randomized experiment reveals that the
average investor is highly responsive to information about the founding team, whereas
information about traction and current investors does not lead to a significantly higher response
rate. This suggests that information about the human capital of the firm is uniquely important to
potential investors, even after controlling for information about the start-up’s idea.
There are two non-mutually exclusive channels through which human capital information
may be important to early stage investors. First, the operational capabilities of the founding team
may be important at the earliest stages of a start-up, when most experimentation takes place.
Second, a founding team with attractive outside options that nevertheless commits to the start-up
sends a strong signal about the firm’s prospects that cannot be otherwise learned by (or credibly
signaled to) investors. If team information only conveys a signal about start-up prospects, then
one would expect that knowledgeable investors who are specialized in the start-up’s sector will
react less strongly to team information. However, we find that such investors react as strongly to
team information as investors that are less familiar with the start-up’s sector, suggesting that the
operational abilities of the founding team matter.
A related question is whether an investment strategy that selects start-ups based on the
team is indeed more successful. Our results suggest that team is important for fundraising, which

4

<-----Page 4----->is a prerequisite for entrepreneurial success. However, exploring this question directly by
observing firm outcomes is not feasible within our experiment, as participating companies are
still at a very early stage, and long-run outcomes such as acquisitions or IPOs are as of yet
unknown. Moreover, the counterfactuals in our analysis are derived from the same start-up with
randomly different information sets. Since more information is revealed before actual
investments take place, we cannot compare the long-term outcomes of treated firms with their
counterfactuals. This is a common limitation in field experiments that rely on correspondence
testing methodology.2
We can, however, explore the screening behavior of successful and highly reputable
investors. The empirical literature attributes successfully investing in early stage firms to skill, as
is evident in the persistence of venture capital returns (e.g., Kaplan and Schoar (2005),
Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2014), Harris et al. (2014), and Korteweg and
Sorensen (2015)). The selection behavior of successful investors is therefore likely to be
correlated with future successful outcomes. We find that the more experienced and successful
investors react strongly only to the team information, which provides indirect evidence of the
viability of an investment strategy based on selecting on team information.
Overall, the results in this paper present evidence for the importance of human capital
assets for the success of early stage firms. Our results, however, do not suggest that non-human
assets are not essential. In that regard, our paper is most closely related to Kaplan, Sensoy, and
Stromberg (2009). They find that business lines remain stable from birth to IPO, while
management turnover is substantial, illustrating the importance of non-human assets. Our results
illustrate the importance of the founding team at the earliest stages of the firm. Together, the two
papers are consistent with Rajan’s (2012) model, in which the entrepreneur’s human capital is

5

<-----Page 5----->important early on to differentiate her enterprise, but to raise substantial funds (for instance, by
going public), the entrepreneur needs to go through a standardization phase that makes human
capital in the firm replaceable, so outside financiers can obtain control rights.
Many papers focus on establishing the impact of early stage investments on firm success
(e.g., Kortum and Lerner (2000), Sorensen (2007), Samila and Sorenson (2010), Kerr, Lerner,
and Schoar (2014), and Bernstein, Giroud, and Townsend (2014)). Yet, little is known about the
process by which early stage investors select the companies to which they provide funding. Our
paper is most closely related to several papers that explore investors’ behavior using surveys and
interviews (e.g., Pence (1982), Macmillan, Siegel, and Narasimha (1986), Macmillan, Zemann,
and Subbanarasimha (1987), Fried and Hisrich (1994)), but ours provides the first large sample
evidence on this issue, spanning thousands of investors and using a randomized field
experiment.3
Our study also contributes to the literature that relates founder characteristics and firm
performance (e.g., Gompers, Lerner, and Scharfstein (2005), Pukthuanthong (2006), Ouimet and
Zarutskie (2013)), and has implications for the literature on the choice to become an
entrepreneur, and their likelihood of success (e.g., Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002),
Hurst and Lusardi (2004), Puri and Robinson (2013)).
The paper is structured as follows. In section I, we give a brief overview of the AngelList
platform. Section II describes the randomized emails experiment, and section III presents
descriptive statistics. In section IV, we analyze investors’ reactions to the emails. Section V
explores why team information is important to investors. Section VI analyzes whether investing
in teams is a viable investment strategy. Section VII discusses robustness and alternative
interpretations of the results, and section VIII concludes.

<-----Page 6----->I. The AngelList Platform
The early stage financing market is dominated by search frictions and asymmetric
information. AngelList is an online platform built to reduce these frictions and improve the
matching between start-ups and potential investors. The platform was founded in 2010, and has
experienced rapid growth since. The company has attracted much attention, and is often argued
to have the potential to reshape the venture capital landscape and early stage funding as a whole.4
Start-up companies looking for funding may list themselves on the platform and post
information about the company, its product, traction (e.g., revenues or users), current investors,
the amount of money they aim to raise and at which terms, and any other information they would
like to present to potential investors. Examples of well-known companies that have raised money
through AngelList are Uber, Pinterest, and Leap Motion.
Accredited investors (as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) can
join the platform to search for potential investments.5 Investors typically list information on their
background, markets and industries of interest, and their portfolio of past and current
investments. The platform hosts many prominent and active investors with extensive experience
investing in, building, and operating early stage companies, such as Marc Andreessen and Ben
Horowitz (of the venture capital firm Andreessen-Horowitz), Reid Hoffman (co-founder of
LinkedIn), Yuri Milner (founder of Digital Sky Technologies), Marissa Mayer (president and
CEO of Yahoo), Max Levchin (co-founder of Paypal), and Dave McClure (of the accelerator 500
Startups).
Through AngelList, interested investors request an introduction to the start-up’s founders.
Usually, investors decide to invest following a phone call with the founders or - depending on
geographical closeness - a face-to-face meeting. There is a strong social networking component

7

<-----Page 7----->to the platform: investors can “follow” each other as well as start-ups, they can post comments
and updates, and they can “like” comments made by others.
By the fall of 2013, about 1,300 confirmed financings had been made through AngelList,
totaling over $250 million, though AngelList estimates that only 50% of completed financing
rounds are disclosed, suggesting that the numbers are potentially much higher. Most investments
were concentrated in 2012 and 2013. The companies funded through AngelList have gone on to
raise over $2.9 billion in later rounds of venture capital and exit money. Over 60% of the firms
that raised a seed round in 2013 have an AngelList profile, and more than half of these firms
attempted to raise funds on the platform, based on a comparison to the Crunchbase database.

II. Experimental Design
The field experiment uses “featured” emails about start-ups that AngelList regularly
sends out to investors listed on its platform. The featured start-ups are real companies, chosen by
AngelList based on an assessment of their appeal to a broad set of investors who have previously
indicated an interest in the industry or the location of the start-up.
Figure 1
around
here

Figure 1 shows an example of a featured email. The email starts with a description of the
start-up and its product. Next, up to three categories of information are listed, describing: i) the
start-up team’s background; ii) current investors who have already invested in the start-up; iii)
traction. Outside of the experiment, a category is shown if it passes a certain threshold as defined
by AngelList with the aim of showing only information that investors might be interested in. The
algorithm is described in detail in Internet Appendix A. For example, the team category is shown
if the founders were educated at a top university such as Stanford, Harvard, or MIT, or if they
worked at a top company such as Google or Paypal prior to starting the company. The final piece

8

<-----Page 8----->of information, which is always shown, is the amount the company aims to raise, and its progress
towards that goal.
In the experiment, we randomly choose which of the team, current investors, or traction
categories are shown in each email, from the set of categories that exceed their threshold. For
example, suppose 1,500 investors qualify to receive an email about a given start-up, and only
team and traction information exceed their disclosure thresholds. A random set of 500 investors
will be sent the email with both team and traction shown (the original email that would have
been sent to all investors outside of the experiment), 500 investors receive the identical email
except that the team category is not shown, and another 500 receive the email that shows the
team, but not the traction information. We do not send any emails with all categories hidden, as
this does not happen outside of the experiment, and could raise suspicion among investors.
Investors respond to the emails using the “View” and “Get an Intro” buttons that are
included in each email. The “View” button takes an interested investor to the AngelList website
to view the full company profile. This event captures the investor’s initial screening phase, and is
the primary dependent variable in our analysis. Alternatively, clicking the “Get an Intro” button
sends an immediate introduction request to the company, but this is a very rare event as nearly all
investors take a look at the full company profile first. Hence, to capture introduction requests, we
record whether an investor asks for an introduction within three days of viewing the email
through either the email or the website. Naturally, we need to exercise caution in interpreting the
results on introductions, as investors will likely have learned more information from the website.
The experiment allows us to circumvent the three main empirical challenges associated
with studying investor decision-making that were mentioned in the introduction. First, we
observe favorable investor reactions as well as cases in which investors choose to pass on an

9

<-----Page 9----->investment opportunity, a necessary requirement for studying which start-up characteristics are
more attractive to investors. Second, we know exactly what information is shown to investors.
Third, randomizing investors’ information sets allows us to separate the potentially endogenous
link between various start-up characteristics.

III. Summary Statistics
A. Emails
The experiment ran over an eight-week period in the summer of 2013. Table I panel A
shows that a total of 16,981 emails were sent to 4,494 active investors, spanning 21 unique startups. Active investors are defined as having requested at least one introduction to a start-up since
the time of their enrollment on AngelList. This excludes people who are not on the platform to
seek new investments, but rather to confirm their affiliation with a start-up that is fundraising or
Table I

to do research without the intent to invest.
For each start-up, we sent an average (median) of 2.76 (3) versions of the email, each
with an exogenously different information set, for a total of 58 unique emails. Each unique email
was sent to 293 recipients on average (median: 264). The number of recipients per unique email
is roughly equal for a given start-up, but varies across start-ups depending on the popularity of
their industries and locations. Between 202 and 1,782 investors receive an email for a given
start-up, with an average of 809 recipients. An investor receives on average 3.78 emails (median:
3 emails), with no investor receiving more than one email for a given start-up. Recipients opened
48.3% of their emails, and 2,925 investors opened at least one email. Of the opened emails,
16.5% of investors clicked on the “View” button to see more information about the start-up.

10

<-----Page 10----->Investors interpret the presence (or absence) of an information category relative to their
expectations of how frequently each category should show up. These expectations are
conditioned by featured emails received in the past. Across the 160 featured companies prior to
the experiment, panel B shows that team, current investors, and traction pass their disclosure
thresholds 89.4%, 80.0%, and 83.3% of the time, respectively. The second line in panel B shows
that the 21 experiment firms have disclosure rates of 90.5%, 81.0%, and 85.7%, respectively.
The disclosure rates of each category are statistically indistinguishable between the two samples,
which is reassuring because it means that investors’ expectations should apply to the experiment.
The disclosure rates are also similar from one category to the next, though the rates in the larger
pre-experiment sample are statistically different at the 10% level. In section VII we present
additional evidence that suggests that the information salience is comparable across categories.
Within the experiment, categories are randomly excluded. Conditional on passing the
threshold, the information regarding team, current investors, and traction is shown about 73% of
the time. Note that these frequencies are different from 50% because we randomize across
different versions of the emails. For example, if team and traction pass the threshold, there are
three versions of the email: one that shows team only, one that shows traction only, and one that
shows both. In that case, team and traction are each shown 67% of the time. As mentioned
above, we do not use the empty set because this never happens outside the experiment.

B. Start-Ups
Table II
around

Table II presents detailed descriptive statistics of the 21 start-ups in the randomized
experiment. Panel A shows that firms are located in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom, and Australia, amongst others, with Silicon Valley being the most popular location

11

<-----Page 11----->(with six firms). Most firms operate in the Information Technology and the Consumers sectors
(panel B).6 Panel C shows that the median start-up has two founders. Most firms (17 out of 21)
have non-founder employees, and the median firm with employees has three workers. The
largest start-up has eleven people, counting both founders and employees. Only a quarter of
firms have a board of directors. Of those that do have a board, the median board size is two, and
no board has more than three members.7 All but two companies have advisors (typically highprofile individuals who are compensated with stock and options), and the median number of
advisors for these firms is three. Panel D reports prior financing information. Twelve companies
(57%) have previously gone through an incubator or accelerator program. Eleven firms (52%)
received prior funding, and raised an average (median) of $581,000 ($290,000). For the sixteen
companies that report a pre-money valuation, the valuation ranges from $1.2 million to $10
million, with an average (median) of $5.5 million ($5.0 million).8 Eighteen companies explicitly
state their fundraising goal, ranging from $500,000 to $2 million, with an average (median) of
$1.2 million ($1.3 million). Most companies (76%) are selling shares, with the remaining 24%
selling convertible notes.

C. Investors
Table III
around
here

Table III reports descriptive statistics of the 2,925 investors who received the featured
emails in the field experiment, and who opened at least one email. This set of investors is the
focus of our empirical analysis. Panel A shows that virtually all investors are interested in
investing in the Information Technology and Consumers sectors. Other key sectors of interest are
Business-to-business, Healthcare and Media.

12

<-----Page 12----->Panel B reveals that investors are very active on the platform, with the average (median)
investor requesting ten (three) introductions to start-ups from the time that they joined the
platform until we harvested the data in the late summer of 2013. Note that there is considerable
heterogeneity in the number of introductions requested, with the lowest decile of investors
requesting only one introduction, while the top decile requested more than twenty.
To measure investors’ past success, AngelList computes a “signal” for each investor and
each start-up that ranges from zero to ten. The algorithm works recursively. It is seeded by
assigning a value of ten to high exit value companies (from Crunchbase) such as Google or
Facebook, and to a set of hand-picked highly credible investors. The signal then spreads to startups and investors through past investments: any start-up that has a high signal investor gets a
boost in its own signal. Likewise, an investor who invests in a high signal company gets a boost
in his or her signal.9 This construction gives credit for having invested both in realized successes,
and in firms that are still too young for an exit, but that show great promise for successful exits in
the future. The average (median) investor signal is 6.4 (6.3), with substantial heterogeneity
across investors as indicated by the standard deviation of 2.3.
The social network on the platform is extensive, and the investors in the sample are wellconnected: the average (median) investor had 591 (202) followers at the time of data collection.
Again, there is large heterogeneity across investors, with the 10th percentile having only twentysix followers while the 90th percentile investor has 1,346 followers. We also construct a weighted
number of followers measure that uses followers’ signal as weights.
Over 90% of investors are actively involved with start-ups.10 Panel B shows that most
(82%) have a track record as investors. Conditional on making an investment, the average
(median) number of investments is 13 (8), though some invest in as many as thirty companies.

13

<-----Page 13----->Roughly 44% of investors are active as advisors to start-ups, with the median advisor advising
two firms, and 17% of investors served as a board member on a start-up. Many investors (60%)
were at one point founders themselves. Of these, the median founded two companies.
Panel D of Table III shows the correlations between investor experience (measured by
Number of investments), past success (Signal), and reputation (# Followers and Weighted #
followers). Though correlated, these measures clearly capture non-overlapping investor subpopulations.
To summarize the above findings, the sample group of investors are active, successful,
connected, and highly experienced, not only in investing in very early stage firms, but also in
building companies from the ground up. As such, these individuals form a sample that is ideally
suited to inform us about the assets that are most important to very early stage firms.

IV. Main Results
Table IV
around
here

Table IV shows regression results for the effect of the randomized information categories
(team, current investors, and traction) on investor click rates. We use the sample of 8,189 opened
emails, to ensure that investors have seen the information in the email. The dependent variable
equals one when an investor clicked on the “View” button in the email, and zero otherwise. The
explanatory indicator variables equal one when an information category is shown in the email,
and zero otherwise. All specifications include start-up fixed effects to control for the effect on
click rates of any information conveyed in the email’s descriptive paragraph, the amount that the
company aims to raise, has already raised, or any other common knowledge about the start-up.
Thus, we compare investor responses within a given start-up.11 We cluster standard errors at the
investor level to account for correlated decisions across emails received by the same investor.12

14

<-----Page 14----->The ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results in column 1 show that revealing
information about the team raises the unconditional click rate by 2.2%, which is statistically
significantly different from zero. With a base click rate of 16.5% (Table I), this represents a 13%
increase. Note that from prior featured emails before the experiment, investors are calibrated to
think that if a given category is missing, then that category has not crossed the disclosure
threshold. This means that the 2.2% difference in the click rate is the difference between an
average team above the threshold relative to an average below-threshold team.
Showing information about the other categories, current investors or traction, does not
significantly alter the click rate. This means that knowing whether a notable investor is investing
in the firm, or if the start-up has material traction, does not make investors more likely to click.
We should be careful to point out that the finding that human capital is the most
important category does not imply that the business idea of the start-up is irrelevant. We explore
variation about information shown on human capital conditional on the information about the
company that is disclosed in the descriptive paragraph of the email. Conditional on this
information, our results show that information about human capital matters to investors.
It is possible that some investors already know the information in the emails, especially if
the start-up is “hot”. If such information is common knowledge, this will be absorbed in the startup fixed effect. In column 2 we allow for heterogeneity by adding controls for investors’ preexisting knowledge, using an indicator variable that captures whether investors already follow
the start-up on AngelList before receiving the email, and a variable that counts prior connections
between the investor and the start-up. Prior connections are measured as the number of people on
the profile of the start-up (in any role) that the investor already follows prior to receiving the
email. Though investors are more likely to click if they already follow the start-up or have pre-

15

<-----Page 15----->existing connections, adding these controls does not change the coefficients on the randomized
information categories. Internet Appendix C further shows that dropping connected investors
from the regressions altogether, strengthens the effect of team on click rates while leaving the
other categories’ coefficients insignificant. To the extent that these proxies are not perfect, our
results are biased towards not finding an effect of the disclosed information, and our estimates
should be interpreted as lower bounds on the importance of the information categories.
In experiments that involve repeated measurement, subjects may learn about the
existence of the experiment, which may change their behavior. This concern is mitigated by the
short (eight-week) experiment window, and the fact that no investor received more than one
email for any one featured start-up. The regression in column 2 also includes as an additional
control the number of prior emails that the investor received in the experiment. The insignificant
coefficient implies that click rates do not change as an investor receives more emails in the
experiment. Unreported regression results show that including interactions of this control with
the information category dummies are also insignificant. Investor responsiveness to disclosed
information thus does not change as the experiment progresses. In columns 3 and 4 we show that
the results are robust to using a logit model instead of OLS.
A unique feature of our setting is that we can explore the importance of the randomized
experiment for identification by re-running the regressions on the subset of 2,992 opened emails
that show every piece of information that crossed the AngelList threshold. These are the only
emails that would have been sent outside of the experiment. Focusing on the OLS regression
Table V
around
here

with only the information categories as explanatory variables, Table V shows that the
coefficients on revealed information about the team, investors, and traction in the sample without
randomization are 0.046, 0.013, and 0.037, respectively, where team is significant at the 5%

16

<-----Page 16----->level, investors is insignificant, and traction is significant at the 10% level.13 These coefficients
are uniformly higher than the coefficients of 0.022, 0.010, and 0.016 using the full set of
randomized emails (replicated in the four right-most columns of Table V), where only team is
significant. Without the experiment, we would thus overestimate the importance of the
information categories, which is exactly what one would expect if good teams, investors, and
traction are positively correlated with good ideas. The results for the other models are similar.

V. Why do Investors React to Information on Founding Team?
Given the importance of team information, what is the channel through which human
capital information is important for early stage investors? One explanation is that the operational
or technical capabilities of the founding team raise the chance of success, especially in the earlier
stages of a firm’s lifecycle, when experimentation is important. An alternative explanation is that
high quality teams have attractive outside options, and can therefore credibly signal the quality
of the idea. We find evidence that human capital is important at least in part due to the
operational capabilities and expertise of the founders.
Consider the null hypothesis in which team matters only because it provides a signal of
the underlying idea. To test this hypothesis we explore the response of investors that specialize in
the sector in which the start-up operates. These investors are the most knowledgeable about this
particular sector, and therefore more capable to evaluate start-up ideas in this area (for example,
from the business description in the email). Therefore, under the null hypothesis, the specialized
investors will not react as strongly to team information as the less knowledgeable investors.
For each start-up, we identify the investors that specialize in its sector by using the tags
that investors provide about their interest and expertise. For example, investors may specify that

17

<-----Page 17----->they specialize in, and look for start-up companies in the clean technology and consumer internet
sectors.14 Investors and start-ups may be associated with multiple sectors, and we calculate the
cosine similarity between the vector of investor sector tags and the vector of tags that the start-up
uses to describe its sector. The similarity measure is highest if an investor and start-up have
identical sets of tags, and lowest if they have no tags in common. We designate investors as
specialized if their similarity measure is in the top 25% of the distribution for a given start-up.15
Table VI
around
here

Column 1 of Table VI repeats our baseline result that investors are highly responsive to
team information. In column 2, we add the specialization dummy variable. As expected given the
declared interest of specialized investors, we find that they have a 3.9% higher click rate (24%
higher than the baseline rate), which is statistically highly significant. The coefficient of the team
information variable, however, remains unchanged.
In column 3, we add the interaction of the specialization and team disclosure dummy
variables, which has a coefficient of -0.002 with a t-statistic close to zero. This result is robust to
adding interactions of the specialization variable with all information categories in column (4).
These regressions show that specialized investors react the same as other investors to
information about the team, despite their superior expertise in evaluating the start-up idea. This
contradicts the null hypothesis, and provides suggestive - albeit not conclusive - evidence that
the importance of the team category is not entirely due to its signal value, but likely also due to
the operational and execution skills of the founding team.

VI. Is it Rational to Invest Based on Founding Team?
A natural next question to ask is whether investors are right to focus on team information.
In other words, are investments selected on founding team characteristics more profitable and

18

<-----Page 18----->more likely to succeed? This question relates to an ongoing debate among academics and
practitioners over what constitutes a firm, and what factors predict future success of an earlystage firm - the idea or the human capital - as discussed by Kaplan, Sensoy, and Stromberg
(2009).
It is challenging to answer this question directly, for several reasons. First, cross-sectional
variation is limited, with only 21 start-ups. Second, it is still too early to observe real outcomes,
since these start-ups are at a very early stage (earlier than most VC investments), and it takes
years before payoffs materialize. Third, our counterfactuals are based on investors with different
information sets on the same start-up. Since they rely on the same firm, we cannot compare longterm outcomes (such as future financing rounds, acquisitions, or IPOs) of treatment and control.
We can, however, take an indirect approach by exploring how successful and experienced
investors react to various information categories. There is skill in investing in early stage firms,
as is evident in the persistence of venture capital returns (e.g., Kaplan and Schoar (2005),
Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2014), Harris, et al. (2014), and Korteweg and
Sorensen (2015)). The selection behavior of successful investors is therefore likely to be
correlated with future successful outcomes.

The regression results in Table VII show the difference in response between experienced
and inexperienced investors, using investors’ total number of prior investments as a measure of
experience. The first column shows that investors who have made at least one investment behave
similarly to the overall sample, and react only to the team information. The inexperienced
investors with no prior investments, who make up 18% of the sample, react not only to the team
information, but also to the traction and current investor information. Columns 2 and 3 redefine
the experience cutoff at the 25th and 50th percentile of investors, ranked by number of

19

<-----Page 19----->investments. The experienced investors still only respond to information about the team, while
the significance of the response to the traction and current investors categories among
inexperienced investors weakens somewhat.16

We also consider other measures of investor experience and prior success. In Table VIII,
we use investors’ signal, which is a measure of both experience and past success. In Table IX,
we use investors’ weighted number of followers to capture his or her importance and
reputation. 17 Overall, the results are robust: more experienced and successful investors only
respond to the information about the team. Given that these investors are more likely to invest in
ultimately successful start-ups, this suggests that selecting on founding team information is a
successful and viable investment strategy.

VII.

Discussion

This section discusses alternative interpretations and additional robustness tests.

A. Ordering of Information Categories
The experiment builds on the repeated interaction between AngelList and investors. To
avoid raising suspicion amongst investors, who are accustomed to seeing emails in a certain
format, the information in the randomized emails is always presented in the same order.
However, since information about the team always appears first, a concern is that our results may
be driven by a “primacy” effect, in which survey responses are more likely to be chosen because
they are presented at the beginning of the list of options (Krosnick (1999)).
The psychology literature suggests that primacy effects are a concern when the list of
alternatives is long, when the included information is difficult to comprehend (leading to

20

<-----Page 20----->respondents’ fatigue), and when respondents have limited cognitive skills (see Internet Appendix
F for a detailed discussion). Our setting is quite the opposite, with sophisticated investors who
were unaware that they were part of an experiment, and simple and concise information with
only three categories (see Figure 1).
We can use our data to test if investor behavior is driven by primacy, as reactions to the
current investors information category should be stronger when it is shown first, which happens
when information about the team is missing from the email. The results in Internet Appendix F
show no evidence supporting the primacy hypothesis. Appendix F also contains simulations that
show that our regression results cannot be explained by primacy alone.

B. Signal-to-Noise Ratios of Information Categories
An alternative interpretation of the results is that they are due to variation in signal-tonoise ratios across the information categories. To fix ideas, it is useful to distinguish between
two factors that can cause differences in signal-to-noise ratios. The first factor is “true” signal-tonoise. For example, if founders’ backgrounds are a less noisy measure of success than a startup’s traction, investors may pay more attention to the team information. This explains why
investors’ reactions differ across information categories, and is in line with our prior
interpretation of the results. The second factor is differences in AngelList’s disclosure threshold
across categories. For example, knowing that a team graduated from a top 1% university could
be very important. If, however, AngelList discloses that a team graduated from a top 95%
college then one might conclude that the team information category is not very useful – not
because educational background is useless but because the way the information is disclosed is
uninformative. This channel is potentially more worrisome, and difficult to rule out completely.

21

<-----Page 21----->There is some evidence of differences in the rates at which the various information
categories pass their disclosure thresholds (Table I panel B). However, the statistical significance
in the larger pre-experiment sample probably overstates the issue, as investors join the platform
at various times, and most of them will not have observed the full history of featured emails. For
most investors, it is likely difficult to distinguish a disclosure rate of 80% versus 90%.
Moreover, all disclosed information is in the far right tail of their respective population
distributions. As described in detail in Appendix A, AngelList discloses founders’ colleges and
past employers if they are in the top 3.5% of their populations (based on AngelList’s internal
rankings). Similarly, information about current investors is disclosed if their signal is in the top
5% of all investors on AngelList. The traction category is disclosed if the company reveals any
traction, since companies do not add traction information to their profile if it portrays them in an
unflattering light. Indeed, only 7.5% of fundraising companies have filled the traction field.
Relative to the population distributions, the disclosure thresholds are thus set very similarly
across categories.
Furthermore, the result in Section VI that inexperienced investors react quite strongly to
the traction and current investors categories, suggests that there is information content in these
categories, and that they are not subject to an uninformative choice of disclosure threshold.
Rather, the evidence suggests that the experienced investors believe that these categories are
simply less relevant to the success of the company (i.e., that these categories have truly low
signal-to-noise), and thus choose to ignore them.
Altogether, we conclude that it is unlikely that the thresholds are set in such a way as to
mechanically cause large differences in signal-to-noise ratios across categories.

22

<-----Page 22----->C. External Validity
AngelList chooses which companies to feature in their emails and which investors to
contact, raising potential external validity (i.e., generalization) concerns about the results.18
Table X
around
here

Table X compares the 21 start-figureups in the experiment to a larger sample of 5,538
firms raising money on AngelList. This larger sample consists of “serious” firms who received at
least one introduction request while attempting to raise capital. Table X shows that the field
experiment firms are slightly larger in terms of the number of founders (2.6 versus 2.1, on
average), pre-money valuation ($5.6 million versus $4.9 million), and funding targets ($1.2
million versus $0.9 million). They are also more likely to have employees (81% versus 53%),
and to have attended an incubator or accelerator program (57% versus 30%). Still, for the most
part the differences are small on both statistical and economic grounds, and the samples are
comparable on other dimensions such as board size, the fraction of companies that get funding
prior to AngelList, and the prior amount raised. Also, in both samples, about three out of four
firms sell equity, while the remainder sells convertible notes. Altogether, the samples do not look
vastly different, mitigating external validity concerns.
To assess its representativeness for the broader start-up market, AngelList compared the
firms on their platform against Crunchbase, a popular wiki-based site with detailed fundraising
information for start-ups. Over 60% of the companies raising a seed round in 2013 have an
AngelList profile, and more than half of these firms attempted to raise funds on the platform.
Coverage differs by geography, though. Close to 60% of successful seed rounds in Silicon
Valley and Texas fundraised on AngelList, compared to only 15 to 20% in Boston and Seattle.
Overall, AngelList appears to capture a fairly representative sample of start-ups seeking seed
funding, though tilted towards Silicon Valley and Texas.

23

<-----Page 23----->With respect to the representativeness of the investors, the experiment covers a large
fraction of the 5,869 active investors on AngelList at the time of the experiment, as 4,494 (77%)
received at least one featured email over the course of the experiment, and 2,925 (50%) opened
at least one of these emails.

D. Combinations of Information Categories
We explore whether information categories have a differential effect when other
information is disclosed at the same time. The results in Internet Appendix G reveal that, overall,
we do not find any evidence of interaction effects. Specifically, we find that both traction and
current investors remain insignificant when conditioning on the appearance of the other
information categories. Similarly, team information remains statistically significant when
interacted with the other categories. One caveat to this analysis is that, since we only have 21
start-ups in the experiment, we cannot rule out that lack of power prevents us from finding any
effects when including multiple interaction terms in the regressions.

E. Detailed Information Categories
Internet Appendix H reruns the regressions in Table IV using more detailed information
categories. For example, team information can be disaggregated into founders’ prior work
experience, their educational background, and whether they have experience in the start-up’s
industry. Only founders’ education shows up weakly statistically significant at the 10% level,
though lack of power is an issue.
The education result raises the question whether investors click simply because they are
curious what their entrepreneur peers are doing. To test this hypothesis, we added an indicator to

24

<-----Page 24----->the regressions in Table IV that equals one if the email reveals that the investor went to the same
college as one of the founders. Its coefficient is insignificant, and the other information category
coefficients are unaffected. We do not have enough power to say whether this coefficient varies
across experience levels, though, as sharing an alma mater with a founder is rare (it happens for
only 78 of the 2,925 investors).

F. Interpretation of Click Rates
Clicks on featured emails are important, because they capture real and important
information about investors’ level of interest in the start-up, which affects ultimate funding
decisions. The base click rate of 16.5% shows that investors do not ignore the information in the
emails, nor do they click on every featured email that lands in their inbox. Moreover, if investors
did not care about the information in the emails, clicks would be random and we would not see a
reaction to any information. The fact that we find economically and statistically significant
results suggests that investors do care and pay attention to the information in the emails.
It is not feasible to use actual investments decisions as an explanatory variable in the
regressions, because investors learn more about the start-up from the AngelList website after
clicking on the email. At that point all information is revealed, and investment decisions are no
longer based on the randomized information (this is a common limitation in field experiments
using the correspondence testing). Nevertheless, given that the search process has moderate to
large frictions, higher click rates should translate into more investments. If the conversion rate
from clicks to investment remains unchanged, our finding that team information increases click
rates by 13% (relative to the base rate) implies a 13% increase in actual investments.

25

<-----Page 25----->Table I panel A quantifies the value of a click through the conversion rate from clicks to
investments. The conversion rate is 2.98%, but it may be as high as 6%, because investors are
not required to report investments to AngelList, and the company estimates that only half of
investments are reported. This is fairly high compared to venture capitalists, who invest in about
1 in every 50 to 100 deals that they look into (Metrick and Yasuda (2010)), although investors on
AngelList may have different incentives than venture capitalists (e.g., Goldfarb et al. (2013)).
Importantly, no investments are made without an initial click on an email. Thus, clicks are a
prerequisite for investment.
Introduction requests are an alternative outcome variable that is less susceptible to the
underreporting issue, because AngelList records whenever an investor requests an introduction
with a start-up through the website. The conversion rate from clicks to introductions is 15.14%
(Table I panel A). This rate is higher than the investment rate not only due to the underreporting
of investments, but also because introductions are a lower screen than investments, as only a
certain proportion of introductions lead to investments. Still, the click-to-introduction conversion
rate shows that clicks are meaningful for real outcomes as they lead to a significant number of
introductions.

VIII. Conclusion
In this paper, we shed light on the investment decision process of early stage investors.
Unlike investments in publicly traded firms, little is known about the selection process of these
investors, despite their important role in promoting innovation and economic growth. This is due
to lack of data on investors’ information sets and unsuccessful fundraising attempts by start-ups,
as well as endogeneity problems due to omitted unobservable start-up characteristics.

26

<-----Page 26----->This paper uses a field experiment that randomly varies investors’ information sets in a
tightly controlled information environment, using emails about featured start-ups on AngelList.
Investors react most strongly to the information about the start-up’s founding team. We provide
further suggestive evidence that investors care about strong founding teams not only for pure
signaling reasons, but also because teams matter for operational reasons. The most experienced
and successful investors only react to team information, suggesting that selecting on founding
team information is a successful and viable investment strategy.
Overall, the results in this paper present evidence for the causal importance of human
capital assets for the success of early stage firms, and contribute to the debate around the
importance of various key assets to organization success. Our results, however, do not suggest
that non-human assets are not essential. Rather, the results are consistent with the model by
Rajan (2012), in which human capital is initially important for differentiation, but needs to be
replaceable in later stages so that outside investors can obtain control rights, thus allowing the
firm to raise large amounts of external funding.

27

<-----Page 27----->Table I: Descriptive Statistics of Emails in Randomized Field Experiment
Panel A reports descriptive statistics of the emails about featured start-ups in the experiment. Each startup has up to three information categories (team, traction, and current investors), each of which would
usually be shown if the category passes AngelList’s disclosure threshold. For each start-up, various
unique emails are generated that randomly hide these pieces of information. The sample is limited to
emails to active investors, who have requested at least one introduction in the past. Clicked measures the
frequency with which investors click on the button in the email that links to the AngelList platform,
where more information is shown, and introductions can be requested. Intro means an investor requested
an introduction within three days of viewing the email. Investment means the investor invested in the
company at any time after receipt of the email. Panel B shows the frequency with which each category
passed the disclosure threshold for 160 companies featured prior to the experiment (first line), and for the
21 experiment firms (second line). The third line shows the p-values of a test with null hypothesis of
equal frequencies across the two samples, for each information category. The last line shows how often
the information was actually shown in the experiment emails conditional on having passed the threshold.
The rightmost column shows the p-value for the Pearson chi-squared test of the null hypothesis that the
proportions in the first three columns are all equal.

This table reports descriptive statistics of the active investors (defined as having requested at least one
introduction through the AngelList platform) who received featured emails about the start-ups in the
randomized field experiment, and opened at least one such email. Panel A shows in which sectors
investors have stated they are interested in investing. A single investor can indicate multiple sectors of
interest. Panel B shows the number of introductions requested by investors, the signal of an investors’
success as computed by AngelList (see the main text for a description of the algorithm), the number of
followers that investors have on the platform, both the raw number and weighted by the followers’ signals,
the percentage of investors that were involved with start-ups in the past, and for those involved with startups, the number of start-ups the investor was involved with. Panel C breaks down involvement into
various roles. Investor (%) shows the percentage of investors who have invested in start-ups. For the
subset of investors who invested in start-ups, If > 0, # start-ups funded reports the number of start-ups
that they invested in. The variable definitions for advisor, board member, and founder follow a similar
pattern. Panel D shows the correlations between the number of investments, signal, and number of
followers.

This table reports regression results of investor responses to the featured emails in the randomized field
experiment. The dependent variable is one when an investor clicked on the “View” button in the featured
email, and zero otherwise. Only opened emails are included in the sample. Team = 1 is an indicator
variable that equals one if the team information is shown in the email, and zero otherwise. Similarly,
Investors = 1 and Traction = 1 are indicator variables for the current investors, and traction information,
respectively. Connections counts the number of people on the start-up’s profile (in any role) that the
investor already follows prior to receiving the email. Prior follow = 1 is an indicator variable that equals
one if the investor was already following the start-up on AngelList prior to receiving the featured email.
Prior emails is the number of emails that the investor has received in the experiment prior to the present
email. R2 is the adjusted R2 for OLS regressions, and pseudo R2 for logit models. Standard errors are in
parentheses, and are clustered at the investor level. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the

<-----Page 34----->Table VI: Response of Specialized Investors
This table reports regression results of investor responses to the featured emails in the randomized field
experiment. The dependent variable is one when an investor clicked on the “View” button in the featured
email, and zero otherwise. Only opened emails are included in the sample. Team = 1, Investors = 1, and
Traction = 1 are indicator variables that equal one if the team, current investors, or traction information,
respectively, are shown in the email. Similarity = 1 is an indicator variable that equals one if the distance
between the vectors capturing investor sector interests and the start-up’s sectors is at the top 25% of the
distance distribution. See the main text for the algorithm used to compute the distance metric. Other
controls are Connections, Prior follow, and Prior emails, as defined in Table IV, but not reported for
brevity. R2 is the adjusted R2 for OLS regressions, and pseudo R2 for logit models. Standard errors are in
parentheses, and are clustered at the investor level. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

This table compares the sample of 21 start-ups in the randomized field experiment (the “experiment
firms”) with a broad sample of 5,538 firms raising funding on AngelList (the “non-experiment firms”).
The non-experiment firms are those firms that attempted to raise money through AngelList and received
at least one introduction request. The variables are as defined in Table II. The rightmost column shows
the p-value for a differences-in-means test between the experiment and non-experiment samples. For nonpercentage numbers, the table shows means, with medians in brackets.

<-----Page 39----->Figure 1: Sample Featured Start-up Email to Investors
This figure shows an example of a featured start-up email that is sent to investors. Each featured start-up
has up to three information categories (team, traction, and current investors) that would normally be
shown in the email if the information for that category reaches a threshold as defined by AngelList. For
each start-up, various unique versions of each email are generated that randomly hide these pieces of
information (the Randomization categories). Each email contains a “View” button that, when clicked,
takes the investor to the AngelList platform where more information about the company is shown, and
introductions to the company’s founders can be requested. The “Get an Intro” button requests such an
introduction straight from the email.

See, for example, Falkenstein (1996), Wermers (2000), and Gompers and Metrick (2001) for evidence on the

investment behavior of mutual funds, and Barber and Odean (2000), and Ivković and Weisbenner (2005) for
individual retail investors.

For example, Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004) send fictitious resumes with randomized names to employers in

order to study discrimination while controlling for applicant resume fixed effects. Since resumes are fictitious, they
can only capture the initial callback response of the employer, rather than actual hiring outcomes.
3

We should mention contemporaneous work by Marom and Sade (2014), who use a large sample of fund-raising

projects on the donation and reward-based platform Kickstarter to explore the correlation between various elements
of the project’s pitch and its funding success.
4

See, for example, “From Leafy to Lofty - venture capital is adapting itself to the new startup landscape” (The

Economist, January 18, 2014), “AngelList - The Social Network for Startups” (Business Week, January 16, 2014),
“How Software is Eating Venture Capital” (Forbes, October 2, 2013) and “AngelList and Beyond: What VC’s
Really Think of Crowdfunding” (Wall Street Journal, October 8, 2013).

For individuals, an accredited investor is a natural person with either at least $1 million in net worth (individually

or jointly with a spouse, but excluding their primary residence) or with income of at least $200,000 (or $300,000
jointly) in each of the two most recent years, and a reasonable expectation of such income in the current year.
6

Note that sector designations are not mutually exclusive. For example, a consumer internet firm such as Google

would be classified as belonging to both the Information Technology and Consumers sectors.
7

At this stage, a board may simply fulfill a legal requirement of incorporation rather than a governance mechanism.

8

The pre-money valuations are based on the companies’ ex-ante proposed terms, not on ex-post negotiated terms.

We do not know the negotiated valuations, but they are likely lower than the ex-ante valuations shown here.
9

The signal calculations use all investments on the AngelList platform, supplemented with data from Crunchbase.

The AngelList data are self-declared investments by investors and start-ups on the platform that were subsequently
verified by AngelList with the party on the other side of the transaction (i.e., investments declared by start-ups are
verified with the investors and vice versa). This includes many companies that are on the platform but have never
raised money through AngelList, such as Facebook. These firms appear on the platform because someone was
verified to have been an investor, founder, board member or advisor.

<-----Page 46----->10

As in the signal calculation, these numbers are not limited to start-ups that tried to raise money through AngelList,

and any roles claimed (advisor, board member, founder, or investor) are verified with the companies in question.
11

The results are nearly identical if we include investor fixed effects.

12

Internet Appendix B shows that the results are robust to clustering by treatment (i.e., by unique featured email),

and to double-clustering by both treatment and investor, using the Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) bootstrap to
avoid bias due to the small number of clusters (Rothemberg (1988), Kauermann and Carroll (2001), Petersen (2009),
Thompson (2011)).
13

Note that we cannot include start-up fixed effects here, as there is no variation in emails for a given start-up.

14

The sector tags provided by investors and start-ups are very specific. The average investor uses 15 tags, and there

are more than a thousand unique sector tags used on the platform.
15

Internet Appendix D describes the cosine similarity measure in detail, and shows that the results are robust to

alternative definitions of similarity. The appendix also shows that cosine similarity is different from experience (a
potential concern if experienced investors have more sector tags), and that the results are robust to adding controls
for investor experience.
16

Internet Appendix E shows that also the inexperienced investors actively request introductions, suggesting that

their primary objective is to invest rather than to observe and learn from the actions of the experienced investors.
17

We also considered the unweighted number of followers, but the correlation with the weighted number of

followers is 0.95 (Table III panel D). For brevity, we only report the results for the weighted number of followers.
18

Note that internal validity due to the choice of featured companies is not a concern, because our inference exploits

the random variation of information within each start-up. Similarly, the choice of recipients does not violate internal
validity, as information is varied randomly across recipients.
