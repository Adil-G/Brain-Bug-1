ENTREPRENEURIAL PROCESSES:
ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL
Frances Fabian and Hermann Achidi Ndofor
ABSTRACT
Past entrepreneurship research has emphasized the importance of the
context of the entrepreneur (e.g., personality) along with environmental
characteristics as predictors of the success of new ventures. Additional
literature has expanded our understanding of how implementation
processes such as business planning, social networking, and external
financing may be key to new venture performance. This paper offers 12
propositions that link these two literatures. Specifically, we argue that the
personality and goals of the entrepreneur, as well as the dynamism and
munificence of the environment, may affect how well implementation
processes enhance new venture performance.

The progress of theory development reﬂects certain patterns; for instance,
the initial identiﬁcation of meaningful constructs, followed by an understanding of the underlying processes, and ﬁnally, the recognition of
boundary conditions through the testing of contingencies and conﬁgurations (Pfeffer & Fong, 2005). Entrepreneurship research is no exception. The
progress made in understanding the characteristics of individual

entrepreneurs (Aldrich, 1999), ﬁrm-level constructs such as entrepreneurial
orientations (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996), contingencies (Baum, Locke, &
Smith, 2001), strategies (Romanelli, 1989), and conﬁgurations (Ndofor &
Priem, 2005) have considerably increased our understanding of venture
performance.
Similarly, there has been a renewed interest in venture creation processes
(Shook, Priem, & McGee, 2003), such as the performance implications of
formulating business plans (Shane & Delmar, 2004), networking for social
capital (Kalnins & Chung, 2006), and seeking venture ﬁnancing (Florin,
2005). They have become increasingly prominent as prescriptive ‘‘one size
ﬁts all’’ steps in new venture creation processes. While research has
examined how these implementation processes contribute to performance, it
has not begun to address the boundary conditions of their effectiveness.
Indeed, the study of entrepreneurship entails a varied mix of individuals,
organizations, environmental characteristics, and entrepreneurial process
actions (Gartner, 1985). The entrepreneurial process exists – among other
things – within the contexts of the entrepreneur, the business concept, the
resource environment, and the dynamics of the market segment. Singular
use of the term ‘‘entrepreneurial process,’’ however, implies a single process
that entrepreneurs follow to establish successful ventures. Yet the varied mix
of individuals who become entrepreneurs, the resources they possess, the
ventures they create, and actions they take – all in environments having
different characteristics – suggest a plurality of processes for successful
ventures with the potential for equiﬁnality across different scenarios.
Gimeno, Folta, Cooper, and Woo (1997) for example, argued that the exit
decision-making process for entrepreneurs differed and was based more on
individual situational factors than on economic performance.
The implications of a plurality of entrepreneurial processes, however, do
not seem to have contributed substantially to our theorizing and empirics on
new venture performance. In this chapter, therefore, we argue that the
effectiveness of entrepreneurial processes is context-driven. To illustrate the
potential for expanding this area, we consider the role of the entrepreneur
and the environmental context in determining both the appropriateness and
effectiveness of three speciﬁc implementation processes: formulating
business plans, relying on social networks, and seeking venture capital.
While we cannot avoid mixing entrepreneurs under different constraints
(Gartner, 1985), it is incumbent on entrepreneurship research to go beyond
identifying the different contexts for entrepreneurship. In particular, there
has been little elaboration, with few exceptions (e.g., Liao & Gartner, 2006),
on the implications of these contexts for the successful implementation and

<-----Page 2----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

251

subsequent performance of different entrepreneurial processes. More
important, such an implication suggests that the best process for building
a new venture might differ between two ﬁrms because of differences in either
the entrepreneur or their environment.
One way to advance this endeavor is to examine different conﬁgurations
of entrepreneurial and environmental characteristics, implementation
processes, and performance. We divide the literature into two substantial
bodies of literature that we call, the ‘‘context of the entrepreneur,’’ and the
‘‘context of the environment.’’ Thus, the entrepreneur is viewed as a sort of
contextual element for a new venture, who affects implementation
performance. The ability of new ventures to successfully implement a
process depends in part on the skills and abilities of the entrepreneur.
Therefore, this chapter examines how the personality characteristics and
goals of the entrepreneur are likely to inﬂuence the effectiveness of
implementation processes for new ventures. Similarly, in relation to the
environmental context, this chapter examines how muniﬁcence and
dynamism in the immediate market environment are also likely to affect
the performance potential of implementation processes. This chapter as such
expands on the previous literature by considering how different contexts
affect the effectiveness of implementation processes. This offers a fruitful
avenue for building some boundary conditions for the effectiveness of
implementation processes in enhancing business performance. Fig. 1
illustrates the focus of our theoretical framework.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Entrepreneurship research has heavily emphasized the two sets of variables
that predict the choice to become an entrepreneur and subsequently venture
performance. The ﬁrst set, that seeks to predict why some people become
entrepreneurs rather than managers, i.e., attain ‘‘entrepreneurial status’’
(Zhao & Seibert, 2006), helps identify the factors that lead to entrepreneurial
behavior, and encapsulates research such as how personality characteristics
differ between managers and entrepreneurs (Stewart & Roth, 2001; Zhao &
Seibert, 2006). It also spans how motivational, demographic, and cognitive
variables like self-efﬁcacy, experience, and risk perception can predict
entrepreneurial intentions (Simon, Houghton, & Aquino, 1999; Baron &
Markman, 2005). This research is particularly important from a macro
political dimension, as entrepreneurial discovery and exploitation are
central to innovative and competitive economies.

Area of Suggested Theoretical and Empirical Development.

The second set of variables emphasize predictors of new venture success
and, as illustrated in the work of Baum et al. (2001), can cross a wide range
of variables including motivational, demographic, environmental, strategic,
trait, and competency variables. This work is also essential from a
normative perspective in promoting the eventual success of entrepreneurial
energy within an economy.
Separately, recent research has renewed interest in extending the horizon
of entrepreneurship toward how different entrepreneurial processes perform
in building successful entrepreneurial organizations (Covin, Green, & Slevin,
2006; Shane & Delmar, 2004). We draw on a deﬁnition of entrepreneurial
processes as ‘‘the methods, practices, and decision-making styles managers
use to act entrepreneurially’’ (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996, p. 36). Our emphasis
on implementation reﬂects what Shane and Venkataraman (2000, p. 218)
referred to as examining the idea of ‘‘why, when, and how different modes of

<-----Page 4----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

253

action are used to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities.’’ Indeed, Stevenson
and Jarillo (1990) also argued for even more focus in the study of
entrepreneurship on process, stating ‘‘what’’ and ‘‘why’’ were not as
important as the ‘‘how’’ question for management research. As Shook
et al. (2003) emphasized, it is entrepreneurial action, rather than individual
characteristics, that is important for venture success. How individual
characteristics and other factors may interact with entrepreneurial action,
i.e., the effective leveraging of implementation processes in new ventures, is
relatively less addressed. Covin et al. (2006, p. 58), for example, argue ‘‘that
the effect of internal organizational processes on the relationship between a
ﬁrm’s EO [entrepreneurial orientation] and its performance is an underexplored topic within the EO realm.’’
One reason for this lack of a coherent exploration may be due to an
evolving description of what constitutes new venture creation processes.
Perhaps best known is Katz and Gartner’s (1988) depiction of intention,
assembling resources, creating an organizational boundary, and exchanging
resources outside the organization. Empirically though, the effort to
identify a descriptive process consistent with this framework has been
fairly unrewarding, with no one pattern common to new organizations
(Reynolds & Miller 1992). Another more recent theoretical depiction of the
implementation process considers as central ‘‘new resource skill’’, which
refers to the ability to ﬁnd both capital and human resources, as well as set
up new operations and new systems (Baum & Locke 2004).
Citing recent interest in identifying and differentiating the stages of
entrepreneurial processes, Baron and Markman (2005) argued for the
literature to begin examining how different variables are likely to perform at
different stages of the entrepreneurial process, which they characterized as
the early, middle, and later phases. According to their model, the early
phase centers on the identiﬁcation of opportunities and is commonly
associated with the outcome of entrepreneurial intentions; the middle phase
emphasizes the gathering of resources and may be measured by items such
as raising capital or gaining patents; and the later phase centers on
managing the enterprise and examines outputs such as revenue and growth.
This depiction is compelling in its emphasis on the potential for variables to
impact different stages of venture creation.
Still, entrepreneurship researchers have hardly ‘‘settled’’ on what
constitute the core ‘‘processes’’ for new venture implementation. Recognizing that we could not hope to be comprehensive in identifying all of the
potential processes, we sought to identify concrete action behaviors that
both generally align with normative prescriptions found in entrepreneurial

<-----Page 5----->254

FRANCES FABIAN AND HERMANN ACHIDI NDOFOR

texts (e.g., Katz & Green, 2005) and which have been the subject of recent
research interest (e.g., Maurer & Ebers, 2006). Consequently, we developed
propositions for three implementation processes that allow us to theorize
about the role of contextual constraints on their effectiveness. These three
implementation processes, as described below, include formulating formal
business plans (Shane & Delmar, 2004), building social networks (Maurer &
Ebers, 2006), and seeking external capital ﬁnancing (Florin, 2005).
In relation to Baron and Markman’s (2005) stages of entrepreneurial
processes, formal business plans occupy the ﬁrst stage, while seeking
external capital occupies the second stage, and building social networks
would span across the second and third stages.
The importance of context to the prescriptive effectiveness of entrepreneurial process models is not novel. A consensus has developed that new venture
performance cannot be examined via any one dimension in isolation (Baum
et al., 2001; Chrisman, Bauerschmidt, & Hofer, 1998). Instead, performance is
based on multiple contingencies, including ﬁrm resources, top management
team or founder characteristics, strategy, and environmental characteristics
(Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990). As Lenz (1980) observed, neither the
entrepreneur, the environment, nor the implementation of business processes
is sufﬁcient to explain performance, but rather, a coalignment of these factors
most likely provides the most explanatory power.
Further, venture performance is inﬂuenced less by the presence of these
variables and more by how well they ‘‘ﬁt’’ together. Fit is deﬁned in terms of
consistency across multiple dimensions of organizational design and context
(Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993). This is consistent with a ‘‘conﬁgurational’’
approach which, at its basic level, proposes higher effectiveness or better
performance for organizations that resemble one of the ideal types proposed
by theory (Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993). Clearly the literature has shown
some support for this idea (e.g., Wiklund & Shepherd, 2003), but again,
prescriptive advice on implementation processes does not appear to be
integrated with these ideas, nor laid out in a programmatic manner as to
why and when these processes would be effective. In the next sections, we
deﬁne the implementation process variables in our theoretical framework.

Formulating Business Plans
Formulating business plans, especially due to the ability of formal plans to
aid in capital ﬁnancing, plays a continuing role (Mason & Stark, 2004) in the
prescriptions of entrepreneurship (Timmons, 1995). The importance of

<-----Page 6----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

255

formulating and documenting plans in order to follow through with
implementing intentions is also supported by research in psychology
(Gollwitzer, 1999). Recent research has further conﬁrmed that business
planning can have positive performance implications (Liao & Gartner, 2006;
Honig & Karlsson, 2004; Shane & Delmar, 2004).
Yet, the formal, rationalistic processes that have composed a substantial
portion of management prescription are not universally accepted (Mintzberg,
1994). The main complaint has been potential unrealistic assumptions about
the usefulness and plausibility of such time investments (Gumpert, 2003).
Similarly, the dynamics of entrepreneurship have led others to reject heavy
planning in favor of more adaptability to unfolding information (e.g., Bhide,
1994). Thus, it seems imperative that entrepreneurship theory pursues a
better understanding of the contexts, which are likely to enhance or diminish
the effectiveness of formulating business plans.

Networking for Social Capital
Obtaining and exploiting social capital has become a visible feature of
strategic management research (Adler & Kwon, 2002), and entrepreneurship
research in particular (Larson & Starr, 1993; Walker, Kogut, & Shan, 1997).
Networking is thus a central activity aimed at obtaining critical social
capital. Social capital refers to ‘‘the sum of the actual and potential
resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the
network of relationships possessed by an individual or social unit’’
(Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998, p. 243). Extending the original insights on
the importance of external resources (Jarillo, 1989), recent entrepreneurship
research has continued to emphasize the ability to generate and tap these
supportive social networks as a critical part of new venture creation
(DeCarolis & Saparito, 2006; Kalnins & Chung, 2006; Steier & Greenwood,
2000; Westlund & Bolton, 2003).
How networking contributes to performance, however, is more complex;
for instance, there is a need to more critically examine the role of trust
(Welter & Smallbone, 2006), and how the dynamic nature of such
networking may actually later constrain performance (Maurer & Ebers,
2006). The implementation of networking for social capital as a prescriptive
recommendation is wrought with difﬁculty. Prusak and Cohen (2001, p. 87)
argue ‘‘y social capital is under assault because few managers know how to
invest in it. Knowing that healthy relationships help an organization thrive
is one thing; making those relationships happen is another.’’ In general,

<-----Page 7----->256

FRANCES FABIAN AND HERMANN ACHIDI NDOFOR

there has been sparse treatment of whether networking is always a boon to
performance across wide conditions of ﬁrm context.
Seeking External Financing
Seeking external capital ﬁnancing has become a central feature associated
with entrepreneurial startups. This reﬂects ﬁnancial theory that emphasizes
maximizing wealth creation through minimizing the ﬁrm’s overall cost of
capital via optimal equity and debt (Myers, 1984). New venture ﬁnancing
relationships may take many forms such as loans with banks, private equity
placements, angel investors, or the more high-proﬁle venture capital. Not all
sources of ﬁnancing are equally appropriate for all ventures or entrepreneurs. Though it clearly can be applied to other types of external ﬁnancing,
a key focus of this chapter is on how the entrepreneurial and environmental
context may be connected to the appropriateness of seeking, and the success
in acquiring, venture capital (Carter & Van Auken, 2005).
Many new ventures do not use venture capital (Baker & Nelson, 2005).
Furthermore, many new ventures that do still fail (Hendershott, 2004). The
factors that improve the success of venture capital investments are
extensively captured by the ﬁnance literature, but this perspective differs
markedly from entrepreneurial research in approach. Speciﬁcally, entrepreneurship research has not emphasized when venture capital is likely to be a
useful direction for a particular venture given entrepreneurial proclivities
and the unique constraints of its market environment.
Interdependence among the Three Processes
Although we discuss each of these three implementation processes
independently, in practice, they are highly interdependent. For example,
an entrepreneur could write a business plan to get external ﬁnancing.
In determining the source of the external ﬁnancing, they can choose an angel
investor or a venture capitalist that is well connected with a potential
customer (thus acquiring valuable social capital). These processes are
examined independently to theorize on two prescriptive questions: are the
uses of these implementation processes more important in some contexts
than in others? And, concomitantly, under what contexts might the
effectiveness of these implementation processes be negated?
To illustrate these ideas, we develop 12 propositions that link the
potential effectiveness of the above implementation processes to factors

from the entrepreneurial and environmental context of the ﬁrm. By no
means is this list meant to be exhaustive, rather it indicates some of the more
immediately fruitful possibilities for this area of research given our informal
review of the literature. Our propositions are shown in Table 1.

Connecting Implementation with the Context of the Entrepreneur
The literature detailing the role of the entrepreneur in building new
enterprises has, by deﬁnition, always led to an interest in the personalities
and goals of entrepreneurs (Bolton & Thompson, 2000; Kuratko, Homsby, &
Naffziger, 1997). Both traits (Baum & Locke, 2004; Zhao, Seibert, &
Lumpkin, 2006) and goal-associated variables such as the need for
achievement (Locke & Latham, 2002) have been linked to entrepreneurial
performance measures (Collins, Hanges, & Locke, 2004). Less examined has
been how these traits interact with implementation of new venture
processes, thus moderating their effectiveness. The ability to effectively
implement important entrepreneurial processes such as the three examined
above, i.e., formulating business plans, building social networks, and
gaining external ﬁnancing, is likely to be related to the traits and
motivations of the entrepreneur. These processes in turn are then related
to venture performance. Thus, we examine how two aspects of the
entrepreneurial context – ‘‘the Big 5’’ personality characteristics and
entrepreneur’s goals – moderate the effectiveness of implementation
processes in new venture creation.

Personality Characteristics
For some time, research has attempted to identify unique characteristics of
entrepreneurs vis-a-vis other managers, shown in Fig. 1 as the arrow
between entrepreneur context and status. A general consensus developed
that there tended to be as much variance within the entrepreneur population
as between entrepreneurs and other business people (Brockhaus, 1980;
Gartner, 1985). Recent work, though, based on the greater reliability
associated with the ﬁve-factor model of personality (Costa & McCrae,
1992), indicates that such a conclusion may be premature (Zhao & Seibert,
2006). Along with personality, entrepreneurship status may also be linked to
other characteristics such as risk attitudes (Stewart & Roth, 2001; Xu &
Ruef, 2004) achievement motivation (Collins, Hanges, & Locke, 2004), selfefﬁcacy, and perseverance (Markman, Baron, & Balkin, 2005).
Research has also suggested identiﬁable links between new venture performance and attributes such as personality (Begley & Boyd, 1987; Zhao,
Seibert, & Lumpkin, 2006), cognitive style (Buttner & Gryskiewicz, 1993),
risk proﬁle (Brockhaus, 1980), and individual-level entrepreneurial orientation (Krauss, Fresee, Friedrich, & Unger, 2005). These ﬁndings are reﬂected
in Fig. 1 as the link between entrepreneur context and new venture performance.
Little research, though, has successfully investigated how leader characteristics such as personality translate to an ability to effectively leverage
ﬁrm processes that can, in turn, affect ﬁrm performance (Shook et al., 2003).
As a suggestive illustration, Peterson, Smith, Martorana, and Owens (2003)
found signiﬁcant relationships between CEO personalities along the ﬁvefactor personality dimensions and top management team dynamics; along
with ensuing relationships with ﬁrm performance. For instance, CEO
neuroticism was related to less TMT cohesiveness, which in turn was
associated with lower income growth for the ﬁrm. Currently, research in
entrepreneurship links personality with entrepreneurial status and intentions
(Zhao & Seibert,2006; Zhao et al., 2006), and personality with performance
(Baum & Locke, 2004; Zhao et al., 2006) but the process for these effects is
less clear (e.g., its effect on critical implementation processes).
The reason this process is so vague may be because the effects of
characteristics on performance tend to be more indirect (Baum & Locke
2004; Ndofor & Priem, 2005). As suggested above, one area that is particularly promising for investigating such processes is personality. Recent
meta-analyses built on the ﬁve-factor model have initiated a resurgence
in personality research. This model refers to the rising consensus that

<-----Page 10----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

259

personality can be validly measured along the ﬁve dimensions of neuroticism,
extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness
(McCrae & Costa, 1990) and is also referred to as ‘‘the Big 5’’ (Goldberg,
1990). Drawing heavily from the ﬁve-factor dimensions to illustrate our
model, we introduce how entrepreneur personality might be linked to the
way a new ﬁrm is able to implement various new venture processes.
Formulating Business Plans
The act of producing a business plan is thought to improve venture
performance in a variety of ways, for instance, by clarifying goals so that
they can be more speciﬁcally pursued, by unearthing new useful information
needed for the plan, and by focusing attention on the most appropriate tasks
(Shane & Delmar, 2004). In fact, the essence of business plan formulation is
less in the output (ﬁnished plan) and more in the new information unearthed
in the process. These beneﬁts seem likely to require that the entrepreneur
be open to new, or discrepant, information to their existing worldviews.
The big ﬁve dimension of openness to experience captures the personality
traits of intellectual curiosity, seeking new experiences, and considering
novel ideas. If indeed formulating business plans is effective to the extent
that the entrepreneur is amenable to accepting and considering new
information and techniques, then it is likely to improve the strategies of
entrepreneurs who are more open. Conversely, the more conventional and
not-so-dynamic nature of entrepreneurs who score low on this dimension
may lead them to formulate poorer plans, and even be more constrained
to these same poor plans than their more open counterparts. Thus we
expect:
Proposition 1. The characteristics of the entrepreneur will moderate the
relationship between formulating a formal written business plan and venture
performance. The relationship between formulating business plans and
performance will be stronger for new ventures in which the entrepreneur is
high on the openness to experience personality characteristic.
Other characteristics such as cognitive style may be important as well. For
instance, differences in cognitive style may make an entrepreneur unwilling
to draw up a business plan. Indeed, as one advisor put it, ‘‘First time
entrepreneurs often cringe when sitting down to write their business plan.
Some spend six months agonizing over each period and comma, and even
worse, others spend six months procrastinating and do nothing’’ (Ventures,
2005). This may reﬂect a more intuitive bent; as noted by Bird (1988), the
analytic or rational approach tends to underlie processes such as the

<-----Page 11----->260

FRANCES FABIAN AND HERMANN ACHIDI NDOFOR

composition of formal business plans that can be in opposition to the
intuitive, contextual thinking of the visionary entrepreneur. Other researchers also emphasize the prevalence of an intuitive type of cognitive style in
many entrepreneurs (Allinson, Chell, & Hayes, 2000; Buttner & Gryskiewicz,
1993) that may counteract the usefulness of time investments in formal
business plans.
Building Social Networks
DeCarolis and Saparito (2006) argued the importance of understanding the
interplay between personality factors and the use of social networks in
entrepreneurial behaviors. Extraversion may be an important personality
dimension in effective networking behavior, and it refers to social interactive
style, such as being outgoing and seeking and liking to work with groups of
people (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Extraversion has been found to be a key
stable correlate with the existence of supportive social networks from college
to midlife (Von Dras & Siegler, 1997). Further, within the business domain,
Forret and Dougherty (2001) found a signiﬁcant relationship between
extraversion and the level of networking behaviors made by 418 managers/
professionals. Recent research has also indicated that creating social
networks may be related to self-monitoring (Mehra, Kilduff, & Brass,
2001), which is also related to extraversion (Morrison, 1997). Thus, we
argue:
Proposition 2. The characteristics of the entrepreneur will moderate the
relationship between building social networks and venture performance.
The relationship between building social networks and performance will
be stronger for new ventures in which the entrepreneur is high on the
extraversion personality characteristic.
Other entrepreneurial characteristics may also be implicated in the
effectiveness of building social networks, such as high emotional intelligence
(Weiand, 2002). While this area of research is still in infancy, a sizable
number of researchers investigate similar constructs under the rubric
of emotional knowledge, intelligence, or emotional quotient. Among
Goleman’s (1995) ﬁve elements of emotional intelligence is the ability to
enter and sustain relationships with others. Thus, one might differentiate
extraversion as the propensity to interact with others, while emotional
intelligence stresses the ability to develop these interactions. In both cases, it
is likely that the potential effectiveness of forming and tapping social
networks for a young ﬁrm may be confounded with entrepreneurial
characteristics. Wholesale prescriptions for building social networks may be

<-----Page 12----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

261

unwarranted for certain types of entrepreneurs, who may possibly be
distracted from other important entrepreneurial tasks.
Seeking Venture Capital
A key issue of obtaining external ﬁnancing is the stressful difﬁculties of
meeting outsiders’ demands for performance deadlines, which can lead to
ﬁrm failure due to conﬂict between the entrepreneur and venture ﬁnanciers
(Van de Ven, Venkatraman, Polley, & Carud, 1988). The personality
dimension of neuroticism includes tendencies toward anxiety, hostility, selfconsciousness, and impulsiveness (Costa & McCrae, 1992) and reﬂects a
person who responds emotionally to situations. Yet clearly, the successful
venture ﬁnancing relationship requires that the entrepreneur handle pressure
and outside demands on a continuing basis. Neuroticism has also been
linked to low self-efﬁcacy and locus of control (Zhao et al., 2006), and thus
it is unlikely to provide the entrepreneur with the ability to persuade
investors to have conﬁdence in the new venture.
Proposition 3. The characteristics of the entrepreneur will moderate the
relationship between gaining and leveraging venture capital ﬁnancing and
performance. The relationship between gaining external capital and
performance will be weaker for new ventures in which the entrepreneur is
high on the neuroticism personality characteristic.
Other characteristics that are likely to be important to the success of
seeking external ﬁnancing include the entrepreneur’s approach to risk
(Forlani & Mullins, 2000). Researchers have found that entrepreneurial
performance may be affected by undue attitudes toward risk such as related
to overconﬁdence, positive illusions, or hubris (Forbes, 2005; Hayward,
Shepherd, & Grifﬁn, 2006; Ottesen & Grenhaug, 2005). Some theorists have
even found that the tendency toward new venture creation may reﬂect
higher testosterone levels that increase risk propensity (White, Thornhill, &
Hampson, 2006)! Barton & Mathews (1989) urged research to explore the
connection between entrepreneurial characteristics like risk aversion and an
interest in pursuing capital ﬁnance. Recent research has indeed shown
correlations between ﬁnancing and the perceptions entrepreneurs hold
about the riskiness of different capital structures (Carter & Van Auken,
2005). Thus, whether due to the compatibility between the ability to handle
risk as found in neuroticism, or due to characteristics such as propensity
toward risk (either due to personality or biased perceptions), it is likely that
the entrepreneur can interact with the ﬁrm’s ability to manage external
capital ﬁnancing affecting the success of this process.

Goals
The importance of examining the goals and related motivations of
entrepreneurs in understanding performance was noted by Baum and
Locke (2004, p. 591). ‘‘Goal theory proposes that speciﬁc, challenging goals
lead to higher performance than other types of goals. No other theory of
motivation has deeper or broader empirical support at the individual,
group, and unit level.’’ Indeed, research has repeatedly identiﬁed signiﬁcant
ﬁndings for the effect of goals on performance thresholds (Gimeno et al.,
1997), meeting ﬁnancial goals (Covin & Slevin, 1991), growth (Baum &
Locke, 2004), and survival (Carsrud & Krueger, 1995). Similarly, some
related motivational goals, such as autonomy (independence) (Kolvereid,
1992) or personal motivations (Birley & Westhead, 1994) and intentions
(i.e., the state of mind that focuses behavior toward a speciﬁc goal, Bird,
1988), are likely to inﬂuence new venture performance. Research repeatedly
indicates that these goal-related dimensions have important performance
implications (Carland, Hoy, Boulton, & Carland, 1984; Vesper, 1980;
Shane, Locke, & Collins, 2003). Goals and objectives are latent, however,
and thus can only inﬂuence performance indirectly through their effect on
behavior. Yet, how these goals and objectives inﬂuence venture performance
through their effect on new venture implementation processes has not been
directly addressed.
Formulating Business Plans
Shane and Delmar (2004) empirically connect goal setting to the effectiveness of business plans. They argued business plans are especially helpful in
that planning can integrate goals into behavior, identify needed skills and
resources, and create a framework for action. This is consistent with
Castrogiovanni’s (1996) asserted role for learning in the planning process.
From another standpoint, Carter, Gartner, and Reynolds (1996) examined
differences between entrepreneurs who were still trying to build a business,
and other entrepreneurs who were further along. They found that the less
successful entrepreneurs had performed fewer activities, and in particular,
had focused on less ‘‘active’’ types of activities, in particular, such as
formulating a business plan. Yet, one way of reconciling these two ﬁndings
is that the existing level of clear goals and motivation of the entrepreneur
may be interacting with the effectiveness of the process of formulating
business plans. In particular, an entrepreneur who begins a business with a
clear goal regarding the market, product, and process may be more aided by
testing the model along the lines found in Carter et al.’s study, rather than

<-----Page 14----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

263

delaying their venture with formal planning. Other entrepreneurs, though,
perhaps even most, will improve their performance if they formalize their
goals through the process of formulating a business plan.
Proposition 4. The goals of the entrepreneur will moderate the relationship between formulating formal business plans and venture performance;
the relationship will be lower the greater the entrepreneur’s pre-existing
clarity on goals.
Building Social Networks
The importance of social networks to much of new venture creation has
had a longstanding role in the literature (e.g., Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986).
Yet little has been done in regard to how key networking assets may
actually be a deciding factor in the entrepreneur’s choice to continue in
venture creation. Speciﬁcally, social networks may contribute to entrepreneurial performance in different ways than reﬂected in economic measures,
and thus contribute to non-ﬁnancial reasons for exit (Ronstadt, 1986). For
instance, social capital accumulated via networking may act as a substitute
for ﬁnancial capital for entrepreneurs with social disadvantages, such as
minority or ethnic immigrant communities (Aldrich & Waldinger, 1990;
Kalnins & Chung, 2006). A large network size for example, may allow
immigrant entrepreneurs to take on markets beyond their ethnic enclave,
while other dimensions of social networking, such as co-ethnic contact,
might act to reinforce more of an enclave strategy (Ndofor & Priem, 2005).
Thus, networking may serve as either a constraint or enablement depending on the goals an entrepreneur has for forming and tapping social
networks.
Proposition 5. The goals of the entrepreneur will moderate the relationship between building social networks and venture performance; the
relationship will be weaker when the entrepreneur’s venture goal in
networking is less ﬁnancial, and/or aimed at meeting unique community
needs.
Seeking Venture Capital
The importance of gaining venture capital ﬁnancing is clearly affected by the
goals of entrepreneurs. For example, an interest in growth is likely essential
in driving entrepreneurial growth behaviors (Baum & Locke, 2004) like
seeking debt or venture backing. In contrast, entrepreneurs who seek
autonomy may be negatively affected by the successful adoption of venture

<-----Page 15----->264

capital partners. In particular, venture capital brings in a set of partners with
stakes in the decision making of the ﬁrm, and thus is likely, as shown in
recent research, to attenuate the power of the founder (Williams, Duncan, &
Ginter, 2006). Indeed, the ability to monitor and control the efﬁcient
founding of a ﬁrm is a critical aim for venture capitalists (Dessi, 2005), and
is likely to create considerable tension for entrepreneurs that value
autonomy (Boot, Gopalan, & Thakor, 2006). Finally, other research has
examined in greater detail links between the motivations of entrepreneurs
and their choices with regard to gaining private equity ﬁnancing (Morandin,
Bergami, & Bagozzi, 2006). Many entrepreneurs, for instance, have been
successful in the face of extremely scarce resources by employing a type of
enacted brokerage, possibly enhancing possibilities for using their ‘‘creativity, improvisation, and social skills’’ (Baker & Nelson, 2005).
Proposition 6. The goals of the entrepreneur will moderate the relationship
between seeking venture capital and venture performance; the relationship
will be weaker the more the entrepreneur’s goals stress autonomy or
creativity, and greater when the goal is toward venture growth.

Connecting Implementation with the Context of the Market Environment
The importance of environmental characteristics in predicting new venture success has an extensive legacy (Korunka, Frank, Lueger, & Mugier,
2003; Sandberg & Hofer, 1987; Romanelli, 1989). The environment
contains the resources and customers needed by a venture to survive, and
all organizations need to be able to acquire these critical resources from
stakeholders within their environment (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991) to
endure and prosper. In deciding whether or not to provide resources to a
venture, institutional theory argues that stakeholders rely on the legitimacy
of the organization (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991). Unfortunately for new
ventures, they do not have the track record of past actions and performance
needed to gain legitimacy and the corresponding access to environmental
resources. This lack of history presents a ‘‘justiﬁable lack of conﬁdence
on the part of customers, distributors, and suppliers that the venture
will survive and therefore little reason to provide patronage’’ (Starr &
MacMillan, 1990, p. 83). Conditions in the environment, such as the relative
level of resources available, or the predictability of success for different
strategies, may exacerbate this problem of gaining external resources for
new ventures.

<-----Page 16----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

265

Muniﬁcence, which captures the level of resources in the environment,
(Castrogiovanni, 1991) and dynamism, which refers to the unpredictability
of market change (McNamara, Vaaler, & Devers, 2003) are both heavily
studied constructs in both management research in general and entrepreneurship in particular (Castrogiovanni, 1996). Moreover, using environmental constructs as potential moderators between ﬁrm processes and ﬁrm
performance has a fairly extensive legacy in management research (Hart &
Banbury, 1994; Tegarden, Sarason, & Banbury, 2003).
Indeed, a recent study by Liao and Gartner (2006) provides a template for
thinking about modeling relationships between environmental dimensions,
processes and performance. Their work found that perceived uncertainty
moderated the relationship between the timing of venture plans and their
performance. In particular, early plans were more important in uncertain
environments while later plans were more important in stable environments.
This implies that the environment provides boundary conditions on the
effectiveness of different new venture processes.

Munificence
Muniﬁcence refers to the ‘‘magnitude of the opportunity’’ in the environment
(Castrogiovanni, 1996) and in particular deals with variables such as the level
of demand or availability of funding that can help new ventures succeed.
When gaining resources from the environment is relatively easy, ﬁrms need to
emphasize new venture implementation processes that stress other imperatives than external resource acquisition to gain competitive advantage. This is
because all competitors in muniﬁcent environments may be able to access
these resources easily as well, resulting only in attaining competitive parity.
Formulating Business Plans
One way of gaining legitimacy from outsiders may be through communicating a compelling vision through a formal, written business plan.
Indeed, citing recent work, Liao and Gartner (2006) noted that startup
entrepreneurs might ‘‘create a plan as a way to legitimate the viability of the
prospective new business with those stakeholders with the resources
required to develop the venture.’’ Yet, even in their own study, they found
over 75% of their respondents who claimed to use planning did not draft
formal written plans, but rather relied on plans ‘‘in their head’’ or ‘‘informal
plans.’’ Still, business plans are considered an important symbolic step
toward gaining resources from external parties (Castrogiovanni, 1996).

<-----Page 17----->266

FRANCES FABIAN AND HERMANN ACHIDI NDOFOR

In contrast, in very muniﬁcent environments, entrepreneurs may ﬁnd less
need to invest time in this process. Another aspect of muniﬁcent environments
may be that they are capable of generating the necessary cash ﬂow as a
substitute for efforts to tap external parties. Castrogiovanni (1996) argued
that other important rationales for business planning – learning, symbolism
and efﬁciency – are unlikely to be as necessary in muniﬁcent environments.
Moreover, entrepreneurs may feel pressured to take action, rather than invest
in formal planning, to respond to the immediate muniﬁcent opportunity. His
proposition in this regard, then, argued that a muniﬁcent environment would
cause less planning by entrepreneurs.
A slightly different question, then, is whether planning in muniﬁcent
environments is positively or negatively related to performance – in other
words, is planning in a muniﬁcent environment likely to be less successful,
or even detrimental, to performance as compared to not planning? A reevaluation of data in three recent studies which had combined formal and
informal business planning processes (Delmar & Shane, 2003; Liao &
Gartner, 2006) might allow for some insight as to whether formal written
plans are necessary to gain the positive planning effect. Honig and Karlsson
(2004) found that indeed such written plans were products of external
institutional pressures, and did not evidence any positive survival or
proﬁtability performance effect. We propose:
Proposition 7. The muniﬁcence of the environment will negatively
moderate the relationship between formulating a business plan and new
venture performance.
Building Social Networks
Shane and Stuart (2002) argue that when stakeholders are unable to
evaluate a venture due to its newness, they can still provide resources to the
venture based on their relationship with the entrepreneur. These relationships can provide a conduit through which a venture can acquire
environmental resources until it is able to establish its reputation and
legitimacy. The relevance of social networking in accessing environmental
resources will, however, depend on the level of other resources (or lack
thereof) possessed by the entrepreneur.
The ‘‘compensation hypothesis’’(Bruderl & Preisendorfer, 1998) argues
that entrepreneurs use an extended network to make up for a lack of other
human and ﬁnancial capital assets. Thus, the value of (and proclivity
toward) utilizing social networking to access external resources will be
less to entrepreneurs who already possess the requisite resources due

<-----Page 18----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

267

to a muniﬁcent environment. Conversely, hostile environments require
that the entrepreneur spend more effort in the area of building social
networks to create relationships that are their own form of resource, or
social capital, to launch the ﬁrm (Ahlstrom & Bruton, 2006). We
propose:
Proposition 8. The muniﬁcence of the environment will negatively
moderate the relationship between building a social network and new
venture performance.
Seeking Venture Capital
The potential link between environmental context and success of an
implementation process is especially salient in the area of seeking venture
capital. For instance, local geographical muniﬁcence is strongly related to
the success of gaining venture ﬁnancing (Green, 2004). One explanation of
why geographical muniﬁcence in venture assets occurs is based on the idea
of ‘‘agglomeration economies of scope’’ and has become one of the more
common terms for explaining why venture capital is likely to be
concentrated in its disbursal. Thus, the venture capital literature suggests
that regional disparities exist in the success of seeking venture capital, and
that these disparities are related to muniﬁcence. In particular, it appears that
seeking venture capital is more likely to be successful in geographically
muniﬁcent environments, and thus more likely to contribute to performance
in this arena. We propose:
Proposition 9. Muniﬁcence will positively moderate the relationship
between seeking venture capital and performance.
This fairly straightforward assertion recommends further related research
that may engage the issue of whether all muniﬁcence is ‘‘created equal’’
across ﬁrms. For instance, recent work linked startup ﬁnancing and success
to the ‘‘spawning’’ practices of existing corporations. In a comparison of the
relatively successful Fairchild against Xerox, it was found that undiversiﬁed,
originally venture-backed ﬁrms are more likely to spawn new entrepreneurs
than other technology ﬁrms (Gompers, Lerner, & Scharfstein, 2005). Thus,
more theorizing about why muniﬁcence improves venture performance may
offer some surprising insights. In the case of Fairchild and Xerox, the
proliferation of a ﬁrm strategic logic to its spinoffs may be more successful
at explaining how environments become muniﬁcent and attract venture
capital than a perspective on the relative abundance of ﬁnancial resources
on a geographical scale.

Dynamism
New industries are likely to have unique dynamics, which will determine the
number and type of entrepreneurs that will succeed in the environment
(Miles, Heeley, & Covin, 2000; Vanderwerf, 1993). Yet how dynamism
moderates the effectiveness of ﬁrm processes provides mixed results
(Miller & Cardinal, 1994). One explanation may be that different kinds of
performance metrics, like quality versus innovation, will perform differently
in dynamic environments under the same type of process (Tegarden et al.,
2003). Similarly, because the type of performance entrepreneurial ﬁrms
pursue (e.g., the creation of new markets) may differ from that of large
ﬁrms, dynamic environments may hold unique implications for the
performance of entrepreneurial implementation processes. Below we offer
some considerations about how dynamism may affect the performance of
new venture processes.
Formulating Business Plans
The effectiveness of planning in dynamic environments is contentious,
though the research for a relationship between large ﬁrm planning and
dynamism suggests that planning is more positive in dynamic environments
(Tegarden et al., 2003). Bhide (1994) argued that the premise for formulating
business plans for smaller entrepreneurial ﬁrms is at least twofold: ﬁrst, it
focuses strategy for the startup in a coherent form; and second, it serves as
necessary documentation for external capital applications. In regard to the
second premise, many entrepreneurial studies acknowledge that a considerable number of entrepreneurs do not use external capital to fund their
startups (Baker & Nelson, 2005; Carter & Van Auken, 2005). Thus, for this
sizable population the question becomes, does pursuing a formal business
plan improve effectiveness by focusing on the creation of a coherent strategy?
Schwenk and Schrader (1993) assessed 14 studies and concluded that they
indicated a small, but positive relationship between planning and
performance in small businesses. The role of environmental conditions in
affecting business plan performance has been mixed, with evidence falling
both ways for planning in turbulent environments (Brews & Hunt, 1999).
Brews and Hunt’s (1999) positive effect for planning in turbulent
environments was associated with a 4-year lag, leading them to conclude
that there may be a considerable period of learning how to plan required.
Even recent studies that have suggested that business planning per se
improves performance under increased perceived uncertainty is not
ironclad. For instance, Liao & Gartner (2006) found that only one-third

<-----Page 20----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

269

of their entrepreneurs that were identiﬁed as having business plans actually
made formal plans and the remaining two-thirds referred to their plans as
either informally written or in their head.
Mintzberg (1994), for example, argues against the use of formal strategic
planning and contends that it can actually be counterproductive, potentially
forestalling necessary adaptation. Others have argued that it is critical to
encourage entrepreneurial actions that can uncover important information
(Baker & Nelson, 2005; ogilvie & Hauge, 1998), and which may even be
more impressive to external actors (Gumpert, 2003). Castrogiovanni (1996)
similarly proposed that while environmental dynamism may prompt greater
planning, it also potentially impedes the advantages of planning by making
the collected information more costly and difﬁcult to interpret. Yet, 10 years
later, we believe the moderating effect of the usefulness of formal planning
when objective environmental conditions are changing is relatively untested.
Thus, we propose:
Proposition 10. Environmental dynamism will negatively moderate the
relationship between formulating written business plans and venture
performance.
Building Social Networks
Social networks are thought to offer some of their greatest advantages in
their ability to enable information transfer (Maurer & Ebers, 2006). Thus,
the usefulness of exploiting social networks may be related to the ability for
this process to inform an entrepreneur on the key strategic choices facing the
organization. Black and Fabian (2000) posited that new entrepreneurs select
different subsets of entrepreneurial orientations, and these differences may
be theoretically linked to differential value in tapping social networks. For
instance ‘‘honing’’ is deﬁned as reﬁning ‘‘practices within a market structure
by emphasizing the acquisition and use of information available from
the relevant economic agents in the marketplace’’ while ‘‘enterprising’’
orientations are more aimed at imposing new deﬁnitions into the marketplace. Thus, depending on the type of dynamism in the marketplace – either
high uncertainty which can be resolved through greater information or high
ambiguity which is resolved by ﬁrm strategies – may determine whether
social networks are of greater importance in the former situation.
The implication of this perspective is that social networks will be
differentially effective based on the type of dynamism in the environment
and the ability for the network to provide venture-enhancing information.
For instance, Eckhardt and Shane (2003) argue strongly for examining the

<-----Page 21----->270

FRANCES FABIAN AND HERMANN ACHIDI NDOFOR

context of opportunity and stress the issue of asymmetries of information in a
substantial set of theories about entrepreneurial opportunities. In particular,
asymmetries of information may signiﬁcantly alert entrepreneurs to new
opportunities by early access to new information. Their arguments also
suggest that some kinds of dynamism are likely to have information dispersed
unequally across various market participants, while other types of dynamism
may not make social networks as useful in informing the entrepreneur,
because of the novelty of the dynamic opportunities. Thus, we propose:
Proposition 11. Dynamism moderates the relationship between building
social networks and new venture performance. Dynamism characterized
by uncertainty resolution will positively moderate the performance
implications of social networks, while disruptive dynamism will be more
amenable to unique ﬁrm strategies.
Seeking Venture Capital
We found little theory in the management literature that linked the success
of seeking venture ﬁnancing to the dynamism of the environment, with one
anecdotal exception. Writing from the perspective of an ‘‘ex’’ venture
capitalist, MIT Lecturer Howard Anderson (2005, p. 43) stated, in reference
to the current stagnate funding climate, that ‘‘y these changes in venture
funding are structural, not cyclical. VCs are actually like cyclical markets;
we can buy in cheaply and wait for exuberance to bail us out.’’. Dynamic
environments, due to greater inherent uncertainty in the value of ventures,
may increase the span of ventures deemed acceptable for funding, and thus
increase the value for an entrepreneur of seeking such investments.
Baum and Silverman (2004) noted that while venture capital funds in
general do not succeed, research does indicate an advantage to new ventures
that receive these funds. In their own study, they found that alliance and
technological resources were of greater value than top management resources
in both attracting venture capital funds and startup performance. In dynamic
environments, it may be that these same technological and alliance resources
become more difﬁcult to formulaically evaluate, thus increasing the ‘‘hit
rate’’ for entrepreneurs seeking to gain venture capital. While our theorizing
is only formative at this juncture, the potential for understanding what
environments have the greatest potential for entrepreneurs to gain funding
‘‘at the edge’’ is of great interest to entrepreneurs. Thus, we tentatively offer:
Proposition 12. Dynamism positively moderates the relationship between
seeking venture capital and venture performance.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Entrepreneurship is central to the vitality of economies through the creation
of new jobs, businesses, and opportunities (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000).
Entrepreneurial success, therefore, is important for the continuous growth
and rejuvenation of economies. Yet despite this centrality, there is a
preponderance of new venture exits, with 34 percent of US startups closing
within their ﬁrst 2 years (Headd, 2004). Similarly, research ﬁndings on what
leads to entrepreneurial success have been inconsistent at best, and more
often contradictory (Shook et al., 2003). For example, while business
researchers, economists, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists all agree that
the entrepreneur is central to the performance of a venture, research linking
the entrepreneur to venture performance has been equivocal. More recently,
consensus has developed that research focusing on both processes (e.g.,
Shane & Delmar, 2004) and a combination of factors (Baum et al., 2001)
provide better insights into new venture performance.
We build on these recent advancements to propose the existence of a
plurality of entrepreneurial processes, which recognizes different approaches
to implementation in entrepreneurial ventures. There is equiﬁnality in the
performance implications of these different processes because their success
depends (among other things) on the entrepreneur and the environment.
Thus, we argue that the effectiveness of entrepreneurial processes is contextdriven by examining the role of the entrepreneur and environmental context
in determining the appropriateness and effectiveness of a selected set of new
venture processes. Incorporating the contingency of context in entrepreneurial processes will not only improve the consistency of research ﬁndings,
but will also improve the quality of normative prescriptions and thus
(hopefully) reduce the exorbitant rate of new venture failures.
Successful empirical examination of the propositions in this chapter
will entail adhering to recent calls by entrepreneurship researchers for
the utilization of multi-level (e.g., Baum et al., 2001) and integrated
(e.g., Eisenhardt & Schoonhoven, 1990) models to gain a better understanding of the determinants of new venture performance. Individual-level
factors (e.g., entrepreneur’s characteristics), ﬁrm-level factors (e.g., venture
business plan, resources) and environmental-level factors (e.g., industry
characteristics such as dynamism) will all have to be integrated in any
meaningful empirical test of the propositions. A compelling research effort
would entail a longitudinal multi-industry study of nascent ventures
beginning at the formative stages to a target event (such as ﬁrst sale or
IPO). Such a longitudinal approach addresses the damaging potential for

<-----Page 23----->272

FRANCES FABIAN AND HERMANN ACHIDI NDOFOR

survival bias (because the unsuccessful ventures will drop out) in relying on
cross-sectional efforts.
In developing the propositions, we assumed that the various entrepreneurial processes were independent. Future research will beneﬁt from
examining how the various entrepreneurial processes interact with each
other in addition to interacting with the entrepreneurial and environmental
contexts. It could be, for example, that superior social capital from the
successful networking of an entrepreneur may reduce the need for a formal
business plan in seeking external ﬁnancing. A close relationship between an
entrepreneur and key individuals who possess resources needed by the new
venture (such as angel investors, venture capitalists and potential suppliers)
provides an informal conduit through which the venture can access these
resources. This conduit may reduce or eliminate the necessity of a very
formal business plan.
Furthermore, while we develop propositions on how the entrepreneurial
and environment context would inﬂuence the effectiveness of various new
venture processes, these relationships could be recursive. Is it possible for
new venture processes to shape or affect their contexts? If new venture
processes are examined as iterative processes with feedback loops, then the
possibility exists for these processes to shape their contexts. For instance, it
was noted that the process of undergoing the composition of formal
business plans might improve the entrepreneur’s performance and ability
(Shane & Delmar, 2004). Also, the notion of micro-level actions shaping
macro-structure is also not new. Within the sociology literature for example,
Gidden’s (1984) structuration theory examines the process through which
individual-level actions shape and change the structure of the institutional
environment. This is more likely to be the case in nascent industries (usually
populated by new ventures) where the norms of competition, industry
structure, etc. have not become rigidly institutionalized. Extending research
by Hendershott (2004), perhaps periods of an inordinate reliance on venture
capital could increase the dynamism of market shakeouts, for instance.
Thus, future research could beneﬁt from taking our propositions one step
further and examining the iterative relationship between context and
process.
Finally, this chapter offers the opportunity to step back from the
entrepreneurship literature and identify some of the pressing demands in our
understanding of entrepreneurial processes. As entrepreneurship educators as
well as researchers, we realized that the variance in the contexts of our
audience (entrepreneurs and soon-to-be entrepreneurs) necessitates a customized approach to prescribing entrepreneurial processes. Entrepreneurial

<-----Page 24----->The Context of Entrepreneurial Processes

273

processes are more or less likely to lead to success based on the characteristics
of the founding entrepreneur and the dynamics of the environment. To the
extent that the effectiveness of entrepreneurial processes is context-driven, then
our prescriptions have to be adjusted accordingly. While our science may tell
us that in a sample of ventures the formulation of business plans may be
related to improved new venture performance, we would be wise to recognize
that perhaps some entrepreneurs and ventures may not be best suited to
following the crowd. One ‘‘size’’ certainly could not ﬁt all!
