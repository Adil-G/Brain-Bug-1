Making Relationships Work
A Conversation with Psychologist John M. Gottman

The best science we have on relationships comes from the most intense relationship
of all – marriage. Here’s what we know about it.

to extol the value of human relationships in the workplace. We all agree that managers
need to connect deeply with followers to ensure outstanding performance, and we celebrate leaders who have the
emotional intelligence to engage and inspire their people
by creating bonds that are authentic and reliable. There’s a
large and fast-growing support industry to help us develop
our “softer” relationship skills; many CEOs hire executive
coaches, and libraries of self-help books detail how best to
build and manage relationships on the way to the top.
Despite all the importance attached to interpersonal dynamics in the workplace, however, surprisingly little hard

scientific evidence identifies what
makes or breaks work relationships.
We know, for instance, that the personal chemistry between a mentor
and his or her protégé is critical to that
relationship’s success, but we don’t try
to work out what the magic is, at least
not in any rigorous way. The absence

ships is closely linked to the way they
manage their personal ones. People
who are abusive at home, for example,
are likely to be abusive at work. If you
believe that – as most psychologists do –
then the relevance of the work of those
who study relationships at home immediately becomes obvious.

they’re about small moments of attachment and intimacy.

little guidance on what you can do
to patch things up. Even the best human resources ofﬁcers may not know
how or when to stage an intervention.
If companies were more effective in
helping executives handle their relationships through difﬁcult times, they
would see the company’s productivity
soar and ﬁnd it much easier to retain
leadership talent.
But if there’s little research on relationships at work, some is beginning
to emerge on relationships at home.
That’s good news because the way that

Few people can tell us more about
how to maintain good personal relationships than John M. Gottman, the
executive director of the Relationship
Research Institute. At the institute’s
Family Research Laboratory – known
as the Love Lab – Gottman has been
studying marriage and divorce for the
past 35 years. He has screened thousands of couples, interviewed them,
and tracked their interactions over
time. He and his colleagues use video
cameras, heart monitors, and other
biofeedback equipment to measure
what goes on when couples experience moments of conﬂict and closeness. By mathematically analyzing the
data, Gottman has generated hard sci-

entiﬁc evidence on what makes good
relationships.
HBR senior editor Diane Coutu went
to the Seattle headquarters of the Relationship Research Institute to discuss
that evidence with Gottman and to ask
about the implications of his research
for the work environment. As a scientist, he refuses to extrapolate beyond his
research on couples to relationships in
the workplace. The media have sensationalized his work, he says. However,
he was willing to talk freely about what
makes for good relationships in our personal lives.
Successful couples, he notes, look
for ways to accentuate the positive.
They try to say “yes” as often as possible. That doesn’t mean good relationships have no room for conﬂict. On
the contrary, individuals in thriving
relationships embrace conflict over
personality differences as a way to
work them through. Gottman adds that
good relationships aren’t about clear
communication – they’re about small
moments of attachment and intimacy.
It takes time and work to make such
moments part of the fabric of everyday life. Gottman discusses these and
other nuances of his wisdom, acquired
from experience and research, in this
edited version of Coutu’s conversation
with him.

<-----Page 2----->You’re said to be able to predict,
in a very short amount of time and
with a high degree of accuracy,
whether couples will stay together
for the long term. How do you
manage that?

Let me put it this way: If I had three
hours with a couple, and if I could
interview them and tape them interacting – in positive ways as well as in
conﬂict – then I would say that I could
predict a couple’s success rate for staying together in the next three to ﬁve
years with more than 90% accuracy.
I’ve worked with 3,000 couples over 35
years, and the data support this claim,
which have now been replicated by
other scientists.
Could you train me to decide
whether I should hire Dick or Jane?

I know this question has come up in
the media, which have tried to sex up
my work. But the reliability you see in
my research has to do with studying relationships speciﬁcally. Just to predict
whether an interviewee would be a
good ﬁt for a job – you couldn’t do it.
At least I know I couldn’t do it. I rely on
my research to be able to look at couples. And even with couples, I need to
witness a sample interaction. The more
emotional and the more realistic the
situation is, the better I am at predicting with a high level of accuracy.
For instance, one test we’ve used for
years is the “paper tower task.” We give
couples a bunch of materials, such as
newspaper, scissors, Scotch tape, and
string. We tell them to go build a paper tower that is freestanding, strong,
and beautiful, and they have half an
hour to do it. Then we watch the way
the couples work. It’s the very simple
things that determine success. One
time we had three Australian couples
do the task. Beforehand, we had the
couples talk on tape about each other
and about a major conﬂict in their
relationship that they were trying to
resolve. So we had some data about
how relatively happy or unhappy they
were. When one couple who came

1717 Gottman.indd 47

across as happy started building their
paper tower, the man said, “So, how
are we going to do this?” The woman
replied, “You know, we can fold the
paper, we can turn the paper, we can
make structures out of the paper.” He
said, “Really? Great.” It took them
something like ten seconds to build a
tower. The wife in an unhappily married couple started by saying, “So how
are we going to do this?” Her husband
said, “Just a minute, can you be quiet
while I ﬁgure out the design?” It didn’t
take much time to see that this couple
would run into some difﬁculties down
the line.
Your work depends heavily on your
interviewing technique. How did
you develop it?

My hero was Studs Terkel. I think he’s
by far the greatest interviewer ever.
Bill Moyers is good. Barbara Walters
is very good, too, but Terkel is amazing. In one interview, he went into a

woman’s attic and said to her, “Give
me a tour, tell me what’s up here.” He
had a big cigar in his mouth, but he
was really interested. Acting as the
tour guide, she said, “Well, I don’t talk
much about this doll.” Terkel pointed
out that it was not a new doll. “No,” she
said, “my ﬁrst ﬁancé gave me this doll,
before he was killed in a car accident.
He was the only man I’ve ever loved.”
Surprised, Terkel remarked, “You’re
a grandmother; you must have married.” She replied, “Yeah, and I love my
husband, but just not like I loved Jack.”
The woman then launched into a great
monologue, prompted by Terkel. We
studied his tapes and based our interview technique on his approach.
What’s your biggest discovery?

It sounds simple, but in fact you could
capture all of my research ﬁndings with
the metaphor of a saltshaker. Instead
of ﬁlling it with salt, ﬁll it with all the
ways you can say yes, and that’s what a

good relationship is. “Yes,” you say, “that
is a good idea.” “Yes, that’s a great point,
I never thought of that.” “Yes, let’s do
that if you think it’s important.” You
sprinkle yeses throughout your interactions – that’s what a good relationship is. This is particularly important
for men, whose ability to accept inﬂuence from women is really one of the
most critical issues in a relationship.
Marriages where the men say to their
partners, “Gee, that’s a good point” or
“Yeah, I guess we could do that” are
much more likely to succeed. In contrast, in a partnership that’s troubled,
the saltshaker is ﬁlled with all the ways

be up and about doing things. I’m not
like that. I don’t multitask the way she
does; if I take a day off, I want it to be
a day off. I want to play music; I want to
have a sense of leisure. We ﬁght about
this difference all the time. She wants
me to do stuff around the house, and
I want her to take it easy. And it’s worth
ﬁghting about this because it’s an important personality difference between
us. I don’t want to adopt her style, and
she doesn’t want to adopt mine.
Another common issue in many relationships is punctuality. People have
huge differences in their attitudes toward it and ﬁght about it constantly.

When a man is not willing to share power with his wife,
our research shows, there is an 81% chance that the
marriage will self-destruct.

you can say no. In violent relationships,
for example, we see men responding to
their wives’ requests by saying, “No way,”
“It’s just not going to happen,” “You’re
not going to control me,” or simply
“Shut up.” When a man is not willing to
share power with his wife, our research
shows, there is an 81% chance that the
marriage will self-destruct.
Does that mean that there’s no room
for conﬂict in a good relationship?

Absolutely not. Having a conﬂict-free
relationship does not mean having a
happy one, and when I tell you to say
yes a lot, I’m not advising simple compliance. Agreement is not the same as
compliance, so if people think they’re
giving in all the time, then their relationships are never going to work.
There are conﬂicts that you absolutely
must have because to give in is to give
up some of your personality.
Let me explain by illustrating from
personal experience. My wife is very
bad at just sitting still and doing nothing. A couple of years ago I gave her a
book called The Art of Doing Nothing.
She never read it. She always has to

48 Harvard Business Review

1717 Gottman.indd 48

|

And they should – because unless
you do, you can’t arrive at an understanding of your differences, which
means you can’t work out how to live
with them.
What else do people in relationships
ﬁght about?

I actually analyzed about 900 arguments last summer. With the help of
the lab staff, I interviewed people about
their ﬁghts – we saw them ﬁghting in
the lab and then outside the lab, and we
talked about the issue. What we learned
from measuring all these interactions
is that most people ﬁght about nothing. Their ﬁghts are not about money,
or sex, or in-laws – none of that stuff.
The vast majority of conﬂicts are about
the way people in the relationship ﬁght.
One ﬁght we studied was about a remote control. The couple was watching
television, and the man said, “OK, let
me see what’s on,” and started channel
surﬁng. At one point the woman said,
“Wait, leave it on that program, it’s kind
of interesting.” He replied, “OK, but ﬁrst
let me see what else is on.” She kept
objecting until he ﬁnally said, “Fine,

here!” and handed her the remote. She
bristled and said, “The way you said
‘ﬁne,’ that kind of hurt my feelings.” He
shot back with, “You’ve always got to
have it your way.” It may seem really elementary, but that’s what people ﬁght
about. Unfortunately, most of these issues never get resolved at all. Most couples don’t go back and say, “You know,
we should really discuss that remote
control issue.” They don’t try to repair
the relationship. But repair is the sine
qua non of relationships, so everybody
needs to know how to process those regrettable moments.
I want to stress that good relationships are not just about knowing when
to ﬁght and how to patch things up.
We also need humor, affection, playing,
silliness, exploration, adventure, lust,
touching – all those positive emotional
things that we share with all mammals.
Something that’s been so hard for me
to convey to the media is that trivial
moments provide opportunities for
profound connection. For example, if
you’re giving your little kid a bath and
he splashes and you’re impatient, you
miss an opportunity to play with him.
But if you splash back and you clean up
later, you have some fun together and
you both get really wet, laugh, and have
a beautiful moment. It’s ephemeral,
small, even trivial – yet it builds trust
and connection. In couples who divorce
or who live together unhappily, such
small moments of connection are rare.
We can’t splash around at work.
Are there equivalent ways to
achieve connections there?

There are many similar things you can
do in a work environment. You can go
into your friend David’s ofﬁce and say,
“How’s little Harry doing?” And he
might say, “You know, he really likes his
new school. He’s excited by it, and in
fact you know what he’s doing now…?”
The conversation might take ﬁve or ten
minutes, but you’ve made a connection.
This goes for the boss, too. A lot of times
the person who’s running an organization is pretty lonely, and if somebody

hbr.org

11/1/07 8:31:04 PM

<-----Page 4----->walks into her ofﬁce and doesn’t talk
about work but instead asks about her
weekend, the message is, “Hey, I like
you. I notice you independent of your
position.” Within organizations, people
have to see each other as human beings
or there will be no social glue.
What about intimate relationships
at work – thumbs up or down?

That can be really problematic. Marriage researcher Shirley Glass did some
terriﬁc work on friendship in the workplace. She gave this wonderful example of a man who hadn’t had sex for a
long time. He and his wife had a new
baby and were ﬁghting a lot. Then after work one day, he and his coworkers
went out to celebrate a really successful quarter at the company. Everybody
had a good time. People eventually
started to go home, but this man and
a female coworker lingered. They were
talking about the excellent fourth quarter earnings, and she said, “You know,
George, this is the happiest I’ve seen
you in months.” Nothing untoward was
happening, but he was enjoying the
conversation in a way that he hadn’t
with his wife in a long time. So on the
way home, he thought to himself, “You
know, we laughed and shared a lot, and
it was kind of intimate, and I should
really go home and say, ‘Nancy, I’m really kind of worried because I just had
a conversation with a woman at work,
and I felt closer to her than I’ve felt to
you in months, and it scares the hell
out of me, and we need to talk.’” But he
knew exactly how his wife would react.
She’d tell him to grow up and would
say, “Hey, I have this baby sucking at
my teats and now you’re being a baby,
too. I don’t need this kind of crap from
you, so just suck it up and get on with
it. You’re a new father, and quit having
those conversations with that woman
at work.” So he decided not to share
the experience with his wife because,
he thought, “Nothing really happened
anyway.” But something did happen,
and now he’s got a secret. That’s the beginning of betrayal.

1717 Gottman.indd 49

Is there no difference between an
emotional and a physical affair?

I honestly don’t think so. I’ve seen this
in my clinical work and in my research.
Most affairs are not about sex at all;
they’re about friendship. They’re about
ﬁnding somebody who ﬁnds you interesting, attractive, fascinating. This can
be on a physical or an emotional level –
it all boils down to the same thing.
What contributes to a successful
long-term relationship?

Look for the positive in each other.
Robert Levenson, of the University
of California at Berkeley, and I are in
the 18th year of a 20-year longitudinal
study in the San Francisco Bay area. We
have two groups of couples who were
ﬁrst assessed when they were in their
forties and sixties and are now, respectively, in their sixties and eighties. The
surprising thing is that the longer people are together, the more the sense of
kindness returns. Our research is start-

ing to reveal that in later life your relationship becomes very much like it
was during courtship. In courtship you
ﬁnd your new partner very charming
and positive. It was all so new then. You
de-emphasized the negative qualities
and magniﬁed the positive ones. In the
long term, the same thing happens. You
say, “She’s a wonder woman. She can
get us through anything.” For instance,
my wife and I have just moved out of
the house we lived in for 14 years, and
she orchestrated the entire thing. She
was amazing. My genius was to sit back
and say nothing. In good relationships,
people savor the moments like this that
they have together.
Is there such a thing as an ideal
relationship?

I don’t really know. Somebody I admired
a long time ago was Harold Rausch, now
retired, from the University of Massachusetts, who studied relationships and
decided there was an optimal level of

10/29/07 11:59:04 AM

<-----Page 5----->DIFFERENT VOICE

|

Making Relationships Work

intimacy and friendship – and of conﬂict. He called couples who had achieved
those levels “harmonious.” He said that
couples who preferred some emotional
distance in their relationships were
psychologically brittle and not very
oriented toward insight and deep understanding. Rausch identiﬁed another
type of couple – those who fought a lot
and were really passionate – and he said
they’re messed up, too.
We studied those three groups of couples as well, and our research showed
that they could all be successful. The
people who wanted more distant relationships and friendships valued loyalty, commitment, and dedication but
weren’t so interested in intimacy. Still,
they could have very happy marriages.
You might think, “OK, they don’t ﬁght

and not lead them down a negative
path. Whether we look at teenagers
or at older couples, it turns out again
and again that respect and affection
are the two most important things.
Whatever your age, there are so many
ways you can show respect for your
partner. Express interest in the story
she’s telling at dinner, pay him compliments, listen to her ideas, ask him to
watch a Nova special with you so that
you can discuss it later. The possibilities
abound.

seconds that I can do to improve my
marriage right now!” I told him that if
I were to pick just one thing it would
be to honor his wife’s dreams. The guy
jumped up, put on his coat, and left the
room. I found out months later that he
had immediately hopped on the subway to Brooklyn, where he surprised
his wife, who was at home with a young
baby. Her mouth dropped when he
asked her what her dreams were. He
told me later that she said she thought
he would never ask.

What other advice emerges from
your study of good relationships?

What would you suggest we be on
guard against in relationships?

I think that men need to learn how to
embrace their wives’ anger. This message is particularly pertinent today because women are now being educated

What I call the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse – criticism, defensiveness,
stonewalling, and contempt – are the
best predictors of breakup or continued misery. Readers familiar with my
work will remember that I consider
contempt to be the worst: It destroys
relationships because it communicates
disgust. You can’t resolve a conﬂict
with your partner when you’re conveying the message that you’re disgusted
with her. Inevitably, contempt leads
to greater conﬂict and negativity. Our
research also shows that people in contemptuous relationships are more likely
to suffer from infectious illnesses –
ﬂu, colds, and so on – than other people. Contempt attacks the immune system; fondness and admiration are the
antidotes.

Within organizations, people have to see each other as
human beings or there will be no social glue.

a lot in order to avoid conﬂict, and
maybe that’s bad for the kids.” It turns
out that wasn’t true at all. We followed
the kids’ emotional and intellectual
development, and a distant relationship between the parents turned out to
be ﬁne for the children. Our research
showed that bickering a lot can be ﬁne,
too, provided that both people in the
relationship agree to it. People have different capacities for how much intimacy
and passion they want and how much
togetherness they want. The problem is
when there’s a mismatch.
Are the short-term factors for success in relationships different from
the factors that make for long-term
success?

We face this question about short- and
long-term success when we study adolescents and their relationships. We
don’t necessarily want a 14-year-old’s
dating relationship to last, but we’d
like it to be a positive experience, and
we’d like to facilitate our kids’ growth

and empowered to achieve more economically, politically, and socially. But
our culture still teaches women that
when they assert themselves they are
being pushy or obnoxious. Women
who get angry when their goals are
blocked are labeled as bitchy or rude. If
men want to have a good relationship
with women, they have to be sensitive
to the changing dimensions of power
and control in the Western world. And
they have to accept the asymmetry in
our relationships for the time being.
The good news is that embracing your
wife’s anger just a little bit can go a long
way toward unleashing feelings of appreciation and affection.
I had this funny experience when I
sold my book The Seven Principles for
Making Marriage Work to my publisher.
I met with the head of the marketing
department, a young guy who leaned
back in his chair as if he were not at
all impressed by any of my work. He
pointed his ﬁnger at me and said, “All

Are you in a successful relationship?

Yes, my wife and I have just celebrated
our 20th wedding anniversary, but we
both had disastrous first marriages.
Mine failed because my ﬁrst wife and
I had opposite dreams. I really love
children and wanted to be a father, but
she wasn’t so sure and that was a deal
breaker. Could a therapist have saved
that relationship? I don’t think so. My
need to be a father was too great. And
I’m so glad I became a dad. It’s the most
important thing I’ve ever done.
