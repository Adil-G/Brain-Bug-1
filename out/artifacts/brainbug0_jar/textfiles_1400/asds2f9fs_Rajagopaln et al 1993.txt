This article develops an integrative framework
of strategic
decision processes based on a review of the past literature. The
framework incorporates environmental, organizational, and decisionspecific antecedents of process characteristics, and their process and
economic outcomes. Key empirical studies are reviewed in the context
of theframework and majorpatterns and contradictions are identified.
Based on this review, useful implicationsfor
theory building, research
methods and managerial practice are identified and several directions
for future research are presented.

Research in strategic management has often been classified into two broad
categories: research dealing with issues of strategy content and research on the
process by which strategy
is created and implemented.
However,
an
examination
of the body of research over the last two decades points to the
domination of the research agenda by content issues. Extensive theoretical and
empirical work has been undertaken
in strategy content on topics such as
portfolio management, diversification,
acquisitions and mergers, divestments,
product-market
choices,
and the alignment
of firm strategies
with
environmental
characteristics. On the other hand, process issues have received
relatively less attention. However, currently there is renewed interest in process
research, along with an increased awareness of the critical interrelationships
between content and process issues (Huff & Reger, 1987). However, as suggested
by Mintzberg and Waters (1985, p. 269), “More research is required on the
process of strategy formation to complement
the extensive work currently
taking place on the content of strategies; indeed, we believe that research on
the former can significantly influence the direction taken by research on the
latter (and vice versa).”

AND DATTA

Why has strategy process research lagged behind research on strategy
content? We believe that this lag can be partly attributed to the fact that unlike
process researchers, content researchers benefited from the early development
of integrative models by researchers such as Ansoff (1965) Andrews (197 I),
Hofer and Schendel (1978) and Porter (1980). These models not only helped
provide content researchers with a common vocabulary,
but also provided
direction and consensus on underlying theoretical and empirical questions. In
contrast, the absence of such integrative models has resulted in process research
remaining fragmented, characterized by limited cumulative theory building and
empirical testing. Further, the problems involved in identifying, observing, and
measuring process variables add to the difficulties in conducting
process
research.
While the strategy process research covers a broad range of issues, this
article focuses on strategic decision processes, an area of research that deals
with the question of how strategic decisions are made in organizations.
Although considerable
progress has been made in this area in recent years,
as Mintzberg and Waters (1985) note, such progress can, at best, be described
as modest. In addition, the body of research is characterized
by a number
of apparent contradictions.
For example, the performance
implications
of
comprehensiveness
in decision processes are still not clear, with studies finding
both negative (e.g., Fredrickson
& Mitchell,
1984) and positive (e.g.,
Eisenhardt,
1989) performance
effects of comprehensive
decision processes
in rapidly changing environments.
This points to the need for an integrative
model that can link the various aspects of strategic decision processes and
provide
us with the means to understand
the commonalities
and
inconsistencies
across various studies.
This article addresses the above and is organized as follows. First, based
on a careful examination of the theoretical and empirical literature on strategic
decision processes, we develop a parsimonious,
integrative framework.
In
addition to identifying key process characteristics, the framework identifies key
antecedent
and outcome
variables associated
with the decision process,
including the interrelationships
among them. Second, this article utilizes this
framework to review and synthesize past research on strategic decision processes
along four distinct research streams. In doing so, we identify the crucial patterns,
contradictions
and gaps in extant research. Finally, this article suggests several
useful directions for future research. These suggestions address implications for
theory building, methodology,
and managerial practice.
An Integrative Framework of Strategic Decision Processes
Theoretical
models of strategic decision processes and classificatory
schemes have been suggested by Allison (1971), Chaffee (1985), Mintzberg
( 1973) Lyles and Thomas (1988), and Hart (1992). These models, which attempt
to depict and explain the process of strategic decision making, reflect different
conceptions of organizations.
They range from “rational” models that present

the image of an integrated, well-coordinated
decision making body, making
reasoned choices from clearly defined alternatives (e.g., Andrews, 1971; Ansoff,
1965) to political/behavioral
models in which decisions are viewed as an
outcome of bargaining and negotiations among individuals and organizational
subunits with conflicting perceptions,
personal stakes and unequal power
(Narayanan & Fahey, 1982; Pettigrew, 1973; Tushman, 1977). Quite obviously,
these models differ substantially in terms of their underlying assumptions about
the decision context and the characteristics of the decision process.
Although the various strategic decision process models differ in many
important respects, a careful review of such models allows us to draw certain
broad conclusions regarding the factors that influence the decision process.
First, given that strategic decisions are made in the context of an organization’s
environment,
the process by which such decisions are made and their
characteristics
are influenced by environmental
attributes such as uncertainty
and complexity. Second, organizational
conditions such as the internal power
structure, past performance,
past strategies, and the extent of organizational
slack have a significant impact on the process. Since these factors may vary
across firms within an industry, strategic decisions often follow different
patterns in different organizations. Third, even within a single organization, the
process can vary across decisions because of differences in decision-specific
factors such as the impetus for the decision, the urgency associated with the
decision, the degree of outcome uncertainty,
and the extent of resource
commitment.
In other words, contextual
antecedent
factors,
namely,
environmental,
organizational,
and decision-specific
factors significantly
influence strategic decision process characteristics.
The three sets of factors described above influence strategic decision
processes which can be described in terms of process characteristics such as the
duration of the process (Schilit & Paine, 1987), the degree of rationality and
comprehensiveness
(Fredrickson,
1984, 1985), the amount of political activity
(Welsh 8c Slusher, 1986), and the extent of individual/sub-unit
involvement in
the decision process (Duhaime & Baird, 1987). Decision process characteristics,
in turn, help determine process outcomes such as the timeliness or speed of
the decision (Eisenhardt,
1989), the level of commitment from individual and
organizational
units (Carter, 1971) and the extent of organizational
learning
(Dutton & Duncan, 1987). Process characteristics as well as process outcomes
influence economic outcomes such as ROI or ROA and, sales or profit growth
(Eisenhardt
& Bourgeois,
1988; Fredrickson
& Mitchell, 1984). Hence a
comprehensive
model of strategic decision processes must include not only the
process characteristics and their antecedents but also their economic and noneconomic outcomes.
The interrelationships
identified above have been depicted in the form of
an integrative strategic decision process framework (Figure 1). In addition to
helping integrate antecedent and outcome variables associated with strategic
decision process characteristics,
the framework serves as a useful analytical
scheme to review and synthesize past empirical research on strategic decision

of research.” Moreover, the framework constitutes a well-specified model which
can help guide future research.
The framework of Figure 1 identifies three sets of antecedent factors:
environmental factors, organizational factors, and decision specific factors,
and two sets of outcomes: process outcomes, and economic outcomes. In our
review of the empirical research, we refer to research examining the three
antecedent factors as Streams I, II, and III respectively. The framework also
postulates relationships
between decision process characteristics
and
outcomes (Stream IV). It is important to note that our definition of the
strategic decision process subsumes all the different phases in the strategic
decision process identified in earlier studies such as problem/issue
identification, alternative generation, evaluation, and selection (Fredrickson,
1984; Mintzberg, Raisinghani, & Theoret, 1976). While a few studies have
examined how strategic decision process characteristics differ across different
phases (Fahey, 1981; Nees, 1983; Schilit, 1987), the focus of these studies has
not been on the strategic decision process as a whole. Our focus is on the
characteristics of the strategic decision process as a whole rather than on the
characteristics of individual phases.
Stream I research (Links 1-4, 4-l-5, and 4-l-6) pertains to the relationship
between environmental factors and strategic decision process characteristics. The
key issue addressed in this stream is how environmental factors (e.g.,
environmental complexity or uncertainty) influence strategic decision process
characteristics (e.g., the extent of rationality and comprehensiveness). On the
other hand, Stream II research (Links 2-4, 4-2-5, and 4-2-6) has primarily
examined how organizational factors such as organizational size, past strategies
and performance, structure, top management team characteristics, and
organizational slack influence decision process characteristics. Research in
Stream III (Links 3-4,4-3-5, and 4-3-6) has addressed the relationships between
decision-specific factors such as decision urgency, decision impetus, decision
complexity, and outcome uncertainty, and process characteristics. Many of the
studies in each of these streams also examine the moderating role of the
antecedent factors on the relationships between decision process characteristics
and their performance outcomes. The last research stream identified through this
framework is Stream IV (Links 4-5, 4-6, and 5-6) which examines relationships
between strategic decision process characteristics and process/ economic
outcomes. In the following section, we review key studies as well as emerging
patterns and contradictions in each stream. Within each stream, studies are
classified and reviewed along the different links identified in Figure 1.
Review of Past Empirical Literature

A systematic search was undertaken to identify empirical studies published
between 1981 and 1992 which examined at least one of the links identified in
Figure 1. In other words, studies which primarily sought to describe or classify
decision processes based mostly on process characteristics without considering
either the antecedent or outcome variables are not included in the review (e.g.,
JOURNAL

OF MANAGEMENT,

VOL. 19, NO. 2, 1993

<-----Page 5----->354

RAJAGOPALAN,

RASHEED,

AND DATTA

Cray, Mallory, Butler, Hickson & Wilson, 1988; Nutt, 1984). Each study was
then classified by one of the authors along four key dimensions: sample, data
sources and methods, measures of key variables, and major findings. The
classification
was independently
verified by co-authors
for the purpose of
validity and consistency.
Stream I: Environmental Influences
Environmental factors, as previously discussed, exert a significant influence
on strategic decision process characteristics. Several studies have attempted to
capture environmental
influences on decision processes either in terms of
environmental attributes such as uncertainty or in terms of one or more specific
industry context(s). Studies belonging to this stream can be broadly classified into
two groups based on the underlying theoretical specification of relationships
examined: (1) those which examine the direct environmental influences on process
characteristics (Link 14) and, (2) those which focus on the moderating role of
the environment
in the relationship
between process characteristics
and
performance outcomes (Links 4-I-5 and 4-l-6). In a majority of the studies that
we reviewed, the exact theoretical specification was rarely made explicit, leaving
us to make inferences about the specification implicitly used by the authors.
Studies representative of Stream I research are reviewed in Table 1.’
Link l-4: Relationships Between Environmental Factors
and Decision Process Characteristics
The influence of an organization’s environment
on its strategic decision
process characteristics has been the subject of a limited number of studies (e.g.,
Jemison, 1981; Shrivastava & Grant, 1985). Fredrickson
(1985) found that
decision processes in situations characterized
by environmental
threats rather
than opportunities
were characterized
by greater
comprehensiveness.
Shrivastava and Grant (1985) also found that differences in environmental
and
organizational
conditions led to variations in decision process characteristics.
Miller, Droge, and Toulouse (1988) found product innovation
to be an
important
aspect of response to uncertainty,
which in turn led to greater
rationality in the firm’s decision making process. However, the small number
of studies in this link does not permit us to make any meaningful generalizations.
Links 4-l-5 and 4-l-6: Environment as a Moderator of the Relationship
between Decision Process Characteristics and Process/ Economic Outcomes
Studies in these links have attempted
to establish some prescriptive
relevance for strategic decision making research by investigating the relationship
between decision process characteristics and process/economic
outcomes (e.g.,
Bourgeois, 1985; Fredrickson
& Mitchell, 1984; Fredrickson,
1984, 1985). A
review of studies in these links reveals that they have focused primarily on one
environmental
dimension, namely, the extent of environmental
uncertainty
defined in terms of either stability (e.g., Fredrickson,
1984, 1985; Fredrickson
& Iaquinto, 1989) or velocity (e.g., Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988; Eisenhardt,
1989). Bourgeois and Eisenhardt (1988) and Eisenhardt (1989) for example,

examine the effects of different process characteristics on both process outcomes
and economic outcomes. The findings of studies belonging to this stream are,
however, somewhat contradictory.
For example, studies by Fredrickson (1984),
Fredrickson and Mitchell (1984), and Fredrickson and Iaquinto (1989) indicate
that comprehensive
strategic decision processes are associated with superior
economic performance
in stable environments
and inferior performance
in
unstable environments.
In contrast, Eisenhardt (1989) found that effective
strategic decisions in high velocity environments,
though made within a short
time duration, are characterized by comprehensiveness.
Judge and Miller (199 1)
found that comprehensiveness
is positively associated with decision speed (a
process outcome), although it led to higher economic performance only in high
velocity environments. This contradiction
may be partly attributable to the role
of organizational factors, such as power distribution and information processing
systems, which were included in Eisenhardt’s studies, but not in Fredrickson’s.
Moreover, in a later study, Fredrickson and Iaquinto (1989) found significant
differences in the levels and types of comprehensiveness
across industries. This
suggests that, along with organizational
factors, industry factors play a crucial
moderating role in the relationship considered in Stream I. These studies also
highlight
the need to consider
important
interaction
effects between
environmental
and organizational
factors while studying the performance
effects of decision processes. Thus, not only do different combinations
of
environment
and strategic decision process characteristics
have different
performance
effects, but within a given environment,
different combinations
of decision processes and organizational contexts may also give rise to different
performance implications.
Our review of Stream I studies also reveals certain important gaps in the
empirical literature. For example, most previous studies have focused on one
aspect of the environment,
namely, uncertainty or rate of change. However,
there are two other critical aspects of a firm’s operating environment,
namely,
complexity
(the number of elements and their interconnectedness),
and
munificence (the resource support provided by an environment)
which have
received relatively little attention. The degree of environmental
complexity in
a firm’s operating environment
directly impacts the amount and nature of
information
that has to be processed by decision makers (Schwenk, 1984;
Thomas, 1984). This, in turn, affects strategic decision process characteristics
such as comprehensiveness,
rationality, and duration. Research on cognitive
processes (Schwenk, 1984; 1988) suggests that high environmental
complexity
may lead to greater use of cognitive simplification processes such as selective
perception,
heuristics and biases, and the use of analogies. These cognitive
simplification
processes, in turn, affect the strategic decision process by
potentially restricting the range of strategic alternatives considered and the
information
used to evaluate alternatives. Techniques developed in social and
cognitive psychology such as cognitive mapping (Axelrod, 1976), may help
researchers understand how decision makers assess interrelationships
among
environmental
factors, which factors they consider important, and how they
arrive at particular choices.

PROCESSES

In addition to environmental
complexity, munificence may also influence
strategic decision processes. Munificence refers to an environment’s capacity
to provide resources which support the organization
(Dess & Beard, 1984).
Organizations in munificent environments are less likely to be penalized for poor
or suboptimal decisions than those in non-munificent
environments.
Thus,
decision processes suited to munificent environments may be inappropriate for
less munificent ones. However, as our review indicates, past research provides
very little direction on questions related to environmental
complexity and
munificence in spite of their important normative implications for managers.
Further, interactions among the three aspects of the environment also need to
be examined. For example, uncertain environments
that are also munificent
(e.g., high growth industries in initial stages of industry evolution) are very
different from uncertain environments
which are far less munificent (e.g.,
mature industries with declining demand or increasing competition). Hence, the
performance effects of comprehensiveness
are likely to be different across these
environments.
Finally, at a broader level, strategic decision process research has paid very
little attention to the cultural and institutional
context within which the
organization
is embedded.
These contextual
factors
have significant
implications for process characteristics
such as participation,
consensus, and
conflict. For example, consensual decision making is more common among
Japanese firms than among U.S. firms primarily because of the high emphasis
placed on consensus by the Japanese culture.
Stream II: Organizational Influences
Characteristics
of strategic decision processes are subject to a variety of
organizational
influences. Key organizational
factors include structure, past
performance,
and top management
team (TMT) characteristics.
Studies
belonging to this stream can also be classified into two broad groups: (1) those
examining
the direct influence
of organizational
factors
on process
characteristics
(link 2-4), and (2) those viewing organizational
factors as
moderating
the relationship
between process characteristics
and process/
economic outcomes (links 4-2-5 and 4-2-6). Studies belonging to Stream II are
presented in Table 2 and discussed below.
Link 2-4: Relationships Between Organizational Factors
and Decision Process Characteristics
Studies in this stream have mostly focused on two sets of organizational
factors: power distributions
within the decision-making
group (Eisenhardt,
1989; Jemison, 1981; Shrivastava & Grant, 1985) and structural aspects such
as formalization,
integration, and decentralization
(Miller et al., 1988). Several
theoretical
arguments
have been made which indicate how these two
organizational
factors influence strategic decision processes. Provan (1989)
argues that managerial perceptions and enactment of the environment
are
heavily influenced by power distribution
within an organization.

problems and issues (Dutton & Jackson,
1987) the type and extent of
information used, and the criteria used to evaluate alternatives (Shrivastava &
Grant, 1985). Similarly, organizational structure can influence information flow
(Bower, 1970; Fahey, 198 l), as well as the extent of analysis and interaction
at different organizational
levels (Miller et al., 1988).
Research relating other organizational
factors such as past strategies, past
performance, and TMT characteristics to strategic decision processes is limited.
Exceptions include studies by Fredrickson (1985), which examined the role of
past performance,
and Fredrickson and Iaquinto (1989) which examined the
effects of changes
in organizational
size and top management
team
characteristics
on decision process comprehensiveness.
In other studies
exploring this link, Fahey (198 1) and Shrivastava and Grant (1985) examined
a wide range of organizational
factors through case studies but did not identify
the specific effects of these factors except in terms of general propositions. Segev
(1987) using laboratory and field experiments, found significant associations
between a firm’s strategic orientation
and strategy making modes. More
recently, Floyd and Wooldridge (1992) found systematic differences in the type
and extent of middle management
involvement
across Miles and Snow’s
strategic types.

of

Although a number of empirical investigations have been undertaken on
the moderating
role of organizational
factors in the relationship
between
decision process characteristics and performance outcomes, consistent patterns
with meaningful implications for practitioners
are yet to emerge. There are
important differences in the findings between studies which do not examine
outcomes (link 2-4) and those which do (links 4-2-5 and 4-2-6). For example,
Shrivastava
and Grant (1985) suggest that formal structures
and power
centralization are associated with rationality in decision making processes, lower
degree of political activity and sub-unit involvement, and quicker decisions.
Similarly Miller et al. (1988) and Miller (1987) found positive relationships
between structural formalization
and integration and also between the extent
of rationality and integration in strategic decision processes. Both these studies
focused on the relationships between organizational factors and decision process
characteristics
but did not explicitly examine the outcome implications.
In
contrast, Eisenhardt (1989) and Eisenhardt and Bourgeois (1988) found that
in rapidly changing environments,
power centralization
is associated with a
within the top
higher degree of political activity (thus, less rationality)
management
team and poorer economic
performance.
In other words,
alternative power distributions
and structures may affect strategic decision
processes differently in different environments
and the outcome effects of
different structure/ power and strategic decision process combinations may also
vary across different environments.

The review of Stream II studies points to several organizational
factors
which, though theoretically meaningful, have received little or no attention in
past research. These include the role of organizational
slack, top management
team characteristics,
and past strategies and performance.
Also, our review
indicates that past research in this link has predominantly
used contingency
theories to study relationships. This is appropriate since these studies primarily
focus on structure and power. However, other theoretical arguments may be
needed to explore the role of the underresearched
organizational factors in the
future. In particular, theories of group decision making and cognition which
emanate from a social psychological perspective of decision making are relevant.
Bateman and Zeithaml(l989)
used the psychology literature on escalation and
decision framing to study the effects of past performance and organizational
slack on the divestment decision. While their study focused on the content rather
than the process of decision making, interesting parallels can be drawn. For
example, favorable past performance and high organizational slack can create
positive decision frames, and high levels of decision maker confidence which,
in turn, can lead to a limited examination
of new alternatives,
limited
information
search, and less comprehensive,
but faster decision processes.
Cognitive simplification
processes such as illusion of control, and selective
perception, which can restrict the range of strategic alternatives considered, may
be associated
with favorable
past performance
and the presence
of
organizational
slack. In a similar vein, the strategic history of an organization,
as evidenced in its past strategies, has a strong influence over its current strategic
choices (Mintzberg
et. al., 1976). Past strategies can be a key source of
organizational
inertia (Tushman & Romanelli, 1985) and often explain why
organizations exhibit momentum in the same direction (Miller & Friesen, 1980).
Thus, past strategies can limit the consideration of new alternatives and build
escalating commitment to an ongoing course of action.
Research into the effects of top management team characteristics (such as
size, tenure, demography)
on strategic decision processes can draw upon
theories of group decision making such as polarization (Lamm & Myers, 1978;
McGrath, 1984), social comparison (Jellison & Arkin, 1977), and persuasive
argumentation
(Vinokur & Burnstein, 1974). These theories of intra-group
decision processes can constitute relevant theoretical bases for understanding
the effects of TMT characteristics on strategic decision processes (Gladstein &
Reilly, 1985). An investigation of TMT characteristics,
in particular, should
provide considerable insight into strategic decision processes. Differences in
demographic characteristics of the TMT such as age and tenure (Hambrick &
Mason, 1984) and heterogeneity
in human capital or managerial resources in
terms of expertise and skills (Castanias & Helfat, 199 1) may explain important
differences in strategic decision processes across firms as well as across decisions
within a firm.
Yet another organizational factor that is seldom addressed in the decision
process literature is the overall level of risk faced by the firm (as distinct from
the uncertainty or risk associated with a specific decision). It is reasonable to
assume that an organization
facing high levels of risk (such as bankruptcy,
JOURNAL

competitive failure etc.) may tend to centralize or accelerate decision making.
There is also evidence that as firms face more risk, their managers tend to take
larger and often unwarranted risks (Figenbaum & Thomas, 1988).
With regard to methodological
perspectives, most studies belonging to this
link have used field surveys and case studies. Given the number of confounding
factors in such settings and the wide variety of factors examined, there are
serious concerns of internal validity. In order to improve future theory building,
researchers may need to make greater use of laboratory and carefully controlled
field settings. These research designs permit the researcher to identify specific
effects of each organizational
factor while controlling for other factors, as well
as possible two-way and three-way interactions (e.g., Bateman & Zeithaml,
1989). Relationships identified in such controlled settings can then be tested
among a wide variety of organizations using techniques of stratified sampling
which control for one set of factors while varying the others (Harrigan, 1983).
Stream III: Influence of Decision-specific Factors
Table 3 presents our summary of Stream III studies. Our review of the
literature within Stream III indicates that relationships between decision specific
factors and decision process characteristics have received very limited attention
in past research. Only 7 out of the 35 studies reviewed by us belong to this
stream. Further, the available body of research is also fragmented. Given the
variety in the types of strategic decisions that managers make, there clearly is
a need to examine the influence of decision context on process characteristics.
Carter’s (197 1) pioneering study indicated that decision context, defined in terms
of level of technical uncertainty, degree of outcome uncertainty, and criticalness
to decision makers, has an important influence on process characteristics.
In
a study of strategic energy management decisions, Fahey (198 1) found that the
process characteristics were influenced by factors such as degree of criticalness,
impetus, and frequency of occurrence. Also, Schilit’s (1987) findings suggest
that the risk/return
characteristics
of a decision impact the extent of upward
influence exercised by middle level managers. Other decision specific factors
that have been identified as influencing process characteristics include decision
complexity
(Astley, Axelsson, Butler, Hickson, & Wilson, 1982) decision
urgency (Pinfield, 1986) decision motive (Fredrickson,
1985; Shrivastava &
Grant, 1985), information
source (Schilit & Paine, 1987) and problem
classification
(Volkema,
1986). Further empirical evidence supporting
the
impact of problem characterization
on decision processes and outcomes is
available in studies by Cowan (1988) and Dutton and Duncan (1987).
In summary, a review of Stream III studies indicates that it is difficult to
draw generalizable conclusions. Three factors are primarily responsible. First,
little consensus exists regarding the definition
and operationalization
of
important decision specific factors, leading to loose and inconsistent definitions
of key constructs. Further, terms such as decision criticalness, decision urgency,
and outcome uncertainty
have been used in several studies with little or no
attempt to satisfy the requirements of construct validity and reliability. Second,
very few studies in Stream III have either controlled for or simultaneously

examined the influence of environmental
and organizational
factors. This
clearly limits our ability to draw strong inferences or to build theory
cumulatively. Finally, studies within this stream have largely ignored process
and economic outcomes. While some conclusions can be drawn with respect
to how different
decision factors influence the decision process, their
performance implications remain unexplored. Exceptions to this observation
are studies by Schilit (1987) and Schilit and Paine (1987) which indicate that
process outcomes such as decision speed are indeed affected by decision
characteristics
(riskiness) and process characteristics
(coalition
activity).
Perhaps the major contribution of studies in this link is a heightened awareness
of the need for closer examination
of the interrelationships
between decision
specific factors and process characteristics.
Stream

IV: Performance

Effects

Given that performance
improvement
is at the heart of strategic
management (Venkatraman
& Ramanujam,
1986), it is not surprising that a
number of empirical studies have examined the relationship between process
characteristics and performance outcomes. While some of the studies included
in our review of Streams 1, II, and III do include performance effects, studies
classified by us under Stream IV are those which focus not upon environmental,
organizational
and decision-specific
antecedents but upon the relationships
between process characteristics
and performance
outcomes (economic
or
process or both). As evident from Table 4 more studies in Stream IV have
focused on links 4-5 (process characteristics and process outcomes) than on links
4-6 (process characteristics and economic outcomes), and 5-6 (process outcomes
and economic outcomes).
Link 4-5: Relationships between Process
Characteristics and Process Outcomes

The relationships between process characteristics
and process outcomes
(link 4-5) are more direct and are less likely to be confounded by extraneous
factors than the relationship
between process characteristics
and economic
outcomes (link 4-6). Timeliness, speed of decision making, acceptability to
organizational
members,
adaptiveness
to change,
and the extent
of
organizational
learning appear to be useful indicators of strategic decision
process outcomes (Quinn & Rohrbaugh,
1983). A stream of research that has
focused on link 4-5 relationships consists of several laboratory studies on the
relative effectiveness of Dialectical Inquiry (DI) and Devil’s Advocacy (DA)
on decision performance.
While these studies provide some evidence that
cognitive conflict induced by DI or DA generally leads to better quality decisions
(e.g., Schweiger, Sandberg & Rechner, 1989; Schweiger, Sandberg & Ragan,
1986), there is no conclusive evidence on whether one method is superior to
another (Schwenk, 1989). Further, if a broader definition of outcome is adopted,
incorporating
such factors as “satisfaction with the decision” and “desire to
continue to work in the group,” the results become even more confusing and
inconclusive.

Link 4-6: Relationships between Process
Characteristics and Economic Outcomes
A number of studies within Stream IV have investigated the relationship
between TMT consensus and economic performance. (Dess & Origer, 1987
provide a comprehensive review). As with the relationship between the
comprehensiveness
of the decision process and economic performance,
empirical results in this area are conflicting. While Bourgeois (1980) and Dess
(1987) found a positive relationship between consensus and firm performance,
Bourgeois (1985) and Grinyer and Norburn (1975) found the relationship to
be negative. Priem (1990) provides a possible explanation for the contradictory
findings. He suggests that a direct relationship between consensus and
performance may be too simplistic and that environmental change may strongly
moderate such a relationship. Further, he argues that consensus itself may be
the outcome of organizational factors or more specifically, TMT characteristics
such as homogeneity and group structure.
While the impact of decision process characteristics on economic outcomes
has been of considerable interest to both researchers and practitioners, it must
be recognized that several organizational and environmental factors also affect
economic performance. As a result, cause-effect relationships are difficult to
establish. Additionally,
because of model underspecification
which
characterizes many of these studies, reported relationships are likely to be
confounded by factors extraneous to the research question under investigation.
Link 5-6: Relationships between Process
Outcomes and Economic Outcomes
As indicated in Table 4, our search identified only four empirical studies
pertaining to link 5-6, i.e., the relationship between process outcomes and
economic outcomes (Eisenhardt, 1989; Eisenhardt & Bourgeois, 1988;
Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988; Wooldridge & Floyd, 1990). Eisenhardt (1989)
found a positive relationship between decision speed and performance. The
study by Wooldridge and Floyd (1990) examined the relationships between
decision process characteristics, process outcomes and economic outcomes.
They found that greater participation and involvement by middle level managers
in strategy formation resulted in greater commitment and understanding of
strategy as well as improved economic performance. Eisenhardt and Bourgeois
(1988), and Bourgeois and Eisenhardt (1988) found increased political behavior
to be associated with reduced decision speed and poorer firm performance.
In summary, our review of links 4-5, 4-6, and 5-6 suggests that certain
important questions have remained unanswered. For example, are there
patterns in the relationships between different strategic decision making process
characteristics and the extent/type of organizational learning that takes place
as a consequence of these processes? If so, what are the performance/ outcome
implications of these relationships? However, before the relationships between
strategic decision processes and organizational learning can be studied, useful
indicators of learning need to be developed. A substantial portion of an

organization’s knowledge base resides in the minds of decision makers involved
in the strategy process (Shrivastava & Grant, 1985; Mintzberg, Raisinghani,

(Barr, Stimpert, & Huff, 1992) can be valid indicators of the types and extent
of changes taking place in the organization’s knowledge base. Further, since
learning is an ongoing process in organizations,
an important issue is whether
we should view it as an outcome variable at all. In other words, while the
knowledge base resulting from organizational
learning is a process outcome,
learning itself could be viewed as a continuous
organizational
process.
Shrivastava and Grant (1985) suggest that different types of organizational
learning systems support different types of strategic decision making models.
For example, formal learning systems such as strategic planning systems and
management information
systems support adaptive strategic decision making
processes. But do different strategic decision making processes contribute
differentially to organizational
learning? Mintzberg and Waters (1985) argue
that comprehensive,
deliberate strategic decision making can often hinder
strategic learning since messages from the environment tend to get blocked out.
On the other hand, strategies which are characterized by emergent/evolutionary
processes may keep the organization
open, flexible, and responsive. Clearly,
more studies which examine links 4-5 and 5-6 are needed to answer these
questions.
Conclusions

and Implications For Future Research

Based on the preceding review of empirical research on strategic decision
processes, several conclusions
and implications
for future research can be
identified. These are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Implications

for Theory Building

Strategic decision process research to date has been based on a very rich
and diverse theoretical base. Empirical studies have often used more than one
theoretical model to study strategic decision processes, resulting in a much richer
description of the process than would have occurred with simpler theoretical
models. However, as elaborated below, our review identifies several ways to
improve future theory building efforts.
Greater utilization of micro theories. A majority of the studies in our review
utilized theoretical models which adopt an organizational or macro perspective
rather than an individual or micro perspective. This is evident in the number
of studies which have utilized contingency theories, rational, socio-political, and
organizational
process models of decision making. The relatively small number
of studies which adopted a more micro view of the decision process typically
utilized group decision making theories. Only five studies (Cray et. al., 1991;
Butler, Davies, Pike, & Sharp, 1991; Fredrickson & Iaquinto, 1989; Schilit &
Paine, 1987; Wooldridge & Floyd, 1990) reflect a combination
of the micro
and macro perspectives in studying this topic. While a macro perspective is both
necessary and useful, strategic process research can benefit greatly from
JOURNAL

acknowledging the role of the individuals and groups involved in the strategic
decision process. In this regard, cognitive psychological theories of decision
making (e.g., Axelrod, 1976; Bateman & Zeithaml, 1989; Kahneman & Tversky,
1984) and theories of group decision making (Gladstein & Reilly, 1985) can
certainly contribute to a better understanding
of the impact of factors such as
individual backgrounds, experiences, biases, group composition, and tenure on
the strategic decision process. We believe that combining the macro and the
micro views of strategic decision making should be particularly useful in both
future theory building and theory testing. Some of the specific research
questions which can be explored from a micro perspective were identified earlier
in our discussion of Streams I and II.
Use of intervening and interactive eflects models. Boa1 and Bryson (1987)
identify four different theoretical specifications that are applicable to process
research. These are independent effects, moderating effects, intervening effects,
and interaction effects. The direct effects of environmental,
organizational, and
decision specific factors on process characteristics (links l-4, 2-4, and 3-4) can
be represented through an independent effects model. Similarly, studies which
have examined links 4-5,5-6, and 4-6 also use independent effects specification.
On the other hand, studies which have examined moderating
effects of
contextual factors on the relationship between decision process characteristics
and outcomes (e.g., links 4-l-5,4-2-5 and 4-3-5) are based on moderating effects
theoretical
specifications.
However,
there are two more theoretical
specifications implicit in Figure 1, namely, intervening and interaction effects.
In the intervening effects model, contextual factors (such as environment,
organization,
and decision-specific
factors) impact outcomes through their
effects on decision process characteristics. Testing this theoretical specification
would enable us to identify both direct as well as indirect effects of contextual
variables and thereby provide guidelines to managers seeking to intervene in
the causal process. In the interactive model, contextual factors interact between
themselves and/ or with process characteristics
to determine outcomes. This
would require methodologies such as stepwise regression which permit inclusion
of main effects as well as interactive effects. Given the minimal use of intervening
and interactive effects specifications in past research, we believe that the testing
of such models will provide interesting insights into the influence of contextual
factors on strategic decision processes.
Inclusion of multiple antecedents. Theoretically, there is little reason to
assume that any one of the three sets of antecedent factors that we have identified
in our model is more important than the others. However, our review shows
that the majority of studies have limited themselves to addressing only one set
of antecedent factors. Although the inclusion of multiple antecedent factors may
increase the complexity of research designs, it does provide several promising
avenues for further research on the interactions between the three sets of
antecedent variables and their performance implications. For example, it can
be argued that organizations
with certain capabilities
may be able to
simultaneously achieve speed and comprehensiveness
in their decision processes
in rapidly changing environments. Such capabilities include the use of real-time

AND DATTA

information, experienced counselors, and active conflict resolution mechanisms
(Eisenhardt, 1989). In fact, it may also help resolve some of the contradictions
in the literature.
For example,
the negative
relationship
between
comprehensiveness
and performance
in unstable environments
observed by
Fredrickson (1984) may, in part, be due to a lack of organizational capabilities.
Similarly, incremental decision making in stable environments
could also be
associated with positive performance
if such incrementalism
is supported by
an ongoing learning process. In other words, based on their past experience
in a stable environment, managers may know what information is relevant and
which alternatives
are feasible. Hence, their lack of comprehensiveness
in
specific decisions may be more than compensated
for by their information
seeking and processing capabilities. Organizational
knowledge bases which
reflect an organization’s cumulative past experiences can be powerful inputs
into the strategic decision process (Shrivastava & Grant, 1985). Organizational
knowledge bases can also serve to routinize strategic decision processes in stable
environments and to reduce uncertainty in rapidly changing environments.
Yet another potentially
fruitful area for future research involves the
interaction between outcome uncertainty, a decision-specific
antecedent, and
environmental uncertainty. Managers can encounter decisions with low degrees
of outcome uncertainty
in an unstable environment
and high-risk decision
situations even in relatively stable environments. Very little is known about the
impact of such interactions
between environmental
attributes and decisionspecific factors on decision comprehensiveness
and decision speed.

Implications for Research Methods

methodological
directions and guidelines for future research in this area. These
are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Greater attention to construct validity. As noted earlier in our review of
Stream III studies, empirical studies have often been plagued by a multiplicity
of definitions and operationalizations.
This is especially true with respect to
decision-specific
antecedent
factors
and strategic

characteristics.
Relatively little attention has been paid thus far to issues of
construct validity and reliability. The use of single-item measures in field studies
and surveys as well as post-facto description of measures by researchers not
only make comparisons across studies difficult but also raises questions about
the internal validity of the findings. Our review indicates that very few studies
make use of multi-item measures or provide tests for scale reliability and
validity. This is a shortcoming which needs to be addressed in future research.
Greater attention to construct validity could potentially lead to narrower scope
for any particular study. Individual studies can meaningfully focus on specific
parts or links within the framework developed in this article without necessarily
sacrificing relevance. Collectively, such studies may yield better insights about

the strategic decision process. In other words, it is possible to achieve both rigor
and relevance within reasonable limits.
Multiple respondents and decision scenarios. A number of studies in the
past have relied on survey questionnaires and single respondents for collection
of data. This can lead to a variety of problems. First, questionnaires are subject
to respondents’ varying interpretations and cognitive orientations and do not
establish whether the context is strategic (Fredrickson, 1986). Second, the
perceptions of a single individual, notwithstanding the person’s organizational
status, may not reflect organizational reality and may be tainted by common
method variance. For example, Wolfe and Jackson (1987) in their study found
a severe lack of agreement among participants about the nature and details of
their own strategic decisions. They found that subjects disagreed more than half
the time on even the most basic elements of their strategic decisions. This
suggests that it is necessary to validate data obtained through survey
questionnaires by using other data sources (Huber & Power, 1985). Content
analyses of transcripts of actual processes, cross-check of recall data, and
multiple concurrent self reports can be used in conjunction with survey
questionnaires to overcome problems of respondent bias and distortions (Wolfe
& Jackson, 1987).
The use of decision scenarios as a research methodology also holds
considerable promise (Fredrickson, 1986). As demonstrated in studies by
Fredrickson and his colleagues, scenarios based on detailed industry knowledge
allow the creation of strategic contexts, while providing respondents with
standardized stimulus. Scenarios can be tailored to different industry contexts.
Moreover, multiple scenarios, when used in a single study, can enable
researchers to achieve internal validity as well as generalizability. Scenarios also
permit the use of multiple respondents, multi-item indicators of research
constructs, and construct development techniques which maximize both
agreement within firms and between-firm variance (Fredrickson, 1986). Finally,
scenarios can also be used to assess cross-sectional and temporal variances by
administering them to the same set of respondents at different points in time
and thereby assessing causal patterns of relationships over time. Scenarios
appear to combine some of the advantages of controlled laboratory studies (i.e.,
high internal validity through controlled stimulus) with those of field studies
(i.e., realism and generalizability). For this reason, they offer a promising data
collection method for future studies.
Methods to represent individual decision processes. As we noted earlier,
research on strategic decision processes can benefit by adopting an individual
or micro perspective. This in turn would require the use of methodologies
appropriate for the study of individual level decision making. A methodology
that could be particularly useful in this respect is metric conjoint analysis (Priem,
1992). Conjoint analysis has been widely used in the marketing and psychology
literatures and is especially appropriate for capturing decision maker’s theoriesin-use, given that managers often have only a poor understanding of their own
decision policies. Yet another methodology that holds considerable promise for
the study of individual decision processes is a procedure that is commonly

referred to as policy-or judgement-capturing.
Recent studies which have used
this methodology
include Hitt and Tyler (1991) and Keats (1991). The use of

enables the researcher to obtain an accurate

behavior, especially the specific
structure of the models used by managers to arrive at strategic decisions.
Use of real-time, longitudinal methods. Cross-sectional studies which pool
strategic decisions across multiple contexts have been commonly used in past
research. In order to obtain a better understanding of causal relationships (both
degree and direction) between contextual variables, process characteristics and
outcomes, research on strategic decision processes needs to make greater use
of longitudinal data collection methods. According to Van de Ven (1992) such
studies are best undertaken on a real-time basis. In real-time longitudinal studies
(e.g., Garud & Van de Ven, 1992) researchers record the timing and other
characteristics
of events and activities as they occur within the organization
through regularly scheduled and intermittent real-time observations. This also
entails the observation of key committee meetings, decision events, and informal
interviews and discussions with key participants in the decision process. Van
de Ven and Poole (1989, 1990) detail the steps involved in implementing a realtime, longitudinal research design to study innovation processes. Garud and
Van de Ven (1992) and Van de Ven and Polley (1992) illustrate the
methodology
of event sequence analysis to examine process models of internal
corporate
venturing and trial and error learning. Observations
from these
studies are equally applicable to the study of strategic decision processes and
offer considerable

how

presented in Figure 1.
Exploration of curvilinear relationships. Much of the empirical research
in the strategy area has traditionally
relied on linear models and linear
estimation techniques. However, relationships among most of the commonly
used constructs are linear only within relatively narrow ranges. For example,
it may be possible to resolve the apparent contradiction
between the findings
from Fredrickson’s
and Eisenhardt’s studies by exploring the existence of
possible
non-linear
relationships
among
environmental
uncertainty,
comprehensiveness,
and performance.
It is possible that comprehensiveness
leads to better performance
up to a certain level of environmental
uncertainty
as evidenced by a positive relationship in Eisenhardt’s studies. But beyond this
level of uncertainty, the additional costs of information gathering and analysis
may exceed the incremental benefits, resulting in a negative relationship between
comprehensiveness
and performance
(as found in Fredrickson’s study). This
also suggests the need to measure environmental
characteristics
using
continuous rather than dichotomous
measures (e.g., stable vs. unstable). The
use of continuous measures would enable an assessment of the point in the Ushaped curve where the relationship changes direction.

Testing of intervening and interactive effects models. We had earlier
discussed the need to develop and test intervening and interactive theoretical
specifications of the framework of Figure 1. Past research has typically used
bivariate, zero-order and partial correlations, and analysis of variance
techniques while testing main effects and moderating effects. However, more
complex analytic methods will be needed to assess relationships within
intervening and interactive model specifications. Such techniques include path
analysis (Wright, 1960; Ginsberg & Venkatraman, 1992), hierarchical regression
analysis (Arnold, 1982), and structural equation modelling (Miller et al., 1988).
Path analysis, for example, can be used to assess the relative importance of
direct and indirect effects of antecedent factors on process outcomes by
including their intervening effects on decision process characteristics. Likewise,
hierarchical regression can be used to include two-way and three-way
interactions between the three sets of antecedent factors with strategic decision
process characteristics as dependent variables.
The relationships presented in Figure 1 can also be tested through structural
equation modelling, wherein process characteristics can be included as both
endogenous and exogenous variables. As endogenous variables, process
characteristics would be determined by environmental, organizational, or
decision-specific antecedent factors. However, they would also serve as
exogenous variables which affect process and economic outcomes along with
environmental,
organizational,
or decision-specific
antecedents. These
relationships could then be assessed through a system of simultaneous,
structural equations. Thus, multiple links could be examined within the same
study.
Implications for Managerial Practice
Research on strategic decision processes has been mostly descriptive in its
orientation. An understanding of strategic decision processes in terms of their
antecedents and outcomes should ultimately lead to guidelines that can be
directly incorporated into managerial practice.
Greater attention to prescriptive relevance. Although a number of studies
have examined the economic and process outcomes of strategic decision
processes, they provide limited guidance for managerial practice. Two general
conclusions seem to emerge from our review. First, the performance effects of
strategic decision processes are context specific. Environmental
and
organizational factors have independent as well as interaction effects, but
unequivocal patterns are hard to establish. Second, processes which induce
intra-group cognitive conflict appear to improve decision quality, but it is
unclear whether such processes also improve other process outcomes such as
decision speed and commitment. While strategic process research so far has
made considerable progress with respect to achieving descriptive accuracy,
unfortunately, it seems that progress towards attaining prescriptive relevance
has been somewhat limited. For example, although research to date has been
very productive in terms of describing how and why decision process
characteristics vary between different contexts, it tells us little about whether
JOURNAL

AND DATTA

one set of characteristics is more effective than another or the conditions under
which such effectiveness can be realized. It also fails to tell us whether decision
processes account for significant variance in performance,
economic
or
otherwise. As suggested by Bateman and Zeithaml(1989),
research should help
in identifying and explicating relationships which are not obvious to managers.
To the extent that the outcome effects of strategic decision processes are both
non-obvious
and extremely complex, studies which examine these links are
likely to have considerable practical significance.
Broader conceptualization
of outcomes. To a large extent, variables used
to capture outcomes in the strategic decision process research reflect the
economic orientation of content researchers. This raises the disturbing question
of whether economic measures of performance are the only legitimate outcome
variables or whether they reflect the biases imposed by the researcher’s cognitive
framework (Reger, 1988) and/or data availability. A broader conceptualization
of process effectiveness which incorporates
both process-related
as well as
economic performance-related
measures (Venkatraman
& Ramanujam,
1986)
will be more meaningful in the context of strategy process research. Also, given
the variety of organizational
and environmental
influences on economic
performance,
cause-effect relationships are much harder to assess in the case
of economic outcomes than in the case of process outcomes. In addition, it is
also unclear whether economic outcomes are the only outcomes valued by top
managers and other decision makers. Other issues of relevance to managers
are the possibilities of trade-offs among different outcomes, their potential
benefits, and their long-term and short-term effects. These and several other
related questions
reflect the need for greater attention
to performance
implications of strategic decision processes and are likely to be very meaningful
from the point of view of practicing managers.
Identification of organizational capabilities. In addition to the above,
enhancing the prescriptive relevance of strategy process research would also
require greater attention to the role of organizational capabilities. For example,
what organizational capabilities help executives make faster and better decisions
and how can organizations develop such capabilities? Eisenhardt’s (1989) study
identifies the role of organizational
capabilities such as the ability to process
real-time information, resolve conflicts and use decision counselors in enabling
executives to make speedy, comprehensive
and effective decisions in rapidly
changing environments.
However, such studies that attempt to identify the
nature of organizational
capabilities associated with effective decision making
are rare in extant literature.
Conclusion
In conclusion,
our review indicates that considerable
work has been
undertaken in the past decade focusing on the antecedents and outcomes of
strategic decision processes. A rich theoretical and empirical research base
already exists, although there has been little cumulative theory building. We
hope that the systematic review undertaken in this article and the several areas

for future research identified therein will enable researchers to build upon extant
literature more meaningfully. Future research into the antecedents and
outcomes of strategic decision processes should strive to achieve the multiple
objectives of being theoretically sound, methodologically
rigorous and
practically meaningful. We hope that the framework proposed in this article
and the critical review undertaken based on that framework constitute a
meaningful step in that direction.
