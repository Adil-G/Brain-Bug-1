Received May 15, 1978
A framework for behavioral observation is described in which the processing of
a stream of behavior is influenced by an individual’s prior knowledge about
behavior, organized into cognitive “schemas.” It is proposed that observational
goals determine the selection of goal-relevant schemas which, in turn, influence
the observer’s processing of an actor’s behavior. Subjects watched a series of
videotaped sequences featuring a female actor with instructions either to form an
impression of her or to remember the details of the tasks she engaged in. They
were then asked to answer questions that were either consistent or inconsistent
with these instructions. Subjects were also instructed to unitize the actions or
events that occurred in the sequence (D. A. Newtson, Journal ofPersonality
and
Social Psychology,
1973, 28 28-38). According to the unitizing measure, subjects
observing with different goals attended to different behavioral features. Further,
impression-forming subjects were apparently more influenced by their implicit
theories of personality than were task-learning subjects when asked to give ratings
of the actor’s personality, and task-learning subjects were relatively more accurate in recalling task-related details. Implications of this framework and these
results for research in behavioral unitization and implicit personality theory are
discussed.

COHEN AND EBBESEN

In the course of social interaction, individuals may use the continuous
stream of verbal and nonverbal behavior for various purposes. For example, new members of the academic community
may use a colleague’s
behavior to learn how to chair a committee meeting; or, alternatively,
they may observe the same sequence of behavior and instead form a
personality judgment of the committee chairperson. When two observers
watch the same stream of behavior for different purposes, their cognitive
processing of the behavioral information
may differ as a result of these
different observational goals. Compare an observer who attempts to learn
how to chair a meeting effectively with one who tries to form an impression of the chairperson. First, the two observers may sometimes attend to
different information:
One may attend to the semantic relationships between the words uttered by the speaker, while the other may listen to the
speaker’s voice tone. Second, observers may interpret the same piece of
information differently: For example, speaking loudly may be seen by one
observer as a technique for commanding attention, while the other observer may interpret it as an indication of extraversion. In addition to
these attentional and interpretive differences observers may remember
different information
as a result of their observational
goals: e.g., the
outcome of the meeting vs the affect in the speaker’s voice.
To study the operation of cognitive processing strategies that result
from different observational goals, one should distinguish between (a) the
processes that underlie the observation of behavior and (b) the srructure
of the information
upon which the processes operate (Norman,
1976;
Rumelhart, 1975). We suggest behavioral observation processes operate
upon information
that is organized into schemas. A schema is an
hypothetical cognitive structure that integrates lower level units of information (i.e., the most concrete or closest to peripheral perception) into a
higher level cohesive and meaningful unit (Bartlett, 1932; Bobrow &
Norman, 1975). Schemas are assumed to represent an individual’s “world
knowledge”, that is, a schema reflects a knowledge of the co-occurrence
of elements (behaviors, objects, features, etc.) that the individual has
acquired through experience. To represent prior experiences fully, a
person must obviously have an enormous number of schemas which
reflect knowledge collected from a variety of situations and domains.
Domains of information ranging from concrete objects (Palmer, 1975) to
complex social information
(Cantor & Mischel, 1977; Markus, 1977;
Taylor, Cracker, & D’Agostino,
1978; Tesser, 1978) have been described
in terms of a schema structure. The relationship
between schematic
elements may be spatial (Posner & Keele, 1970), temporal (Schank &
Abelson, 1977), or associative, such as among attributes of a person
(Markus, 1977).
Previous theorists have assumed that schemas may be used at three
different stages of information
processing. First, attention may be di-

rected toward those features in the environment that are contained in a
particular schema. Second, a particular schema may be used as a
framework for comprehending
or integrating incoming information,
particularly when the information is ambiguous. Finally, a particular schema
may serve to guide the reconstruction of an event in memory (Cantor &
Mischel, 1977; Neisser, 1976; Norman, 1976).
A processing model that uses the construct of “schema” should include
a mechanism for selecting the subset of schemas in operation at any
particular moment (cf. Schank & Abelson, 1977). We suggest that an
individual’s observational goal specifies the selection of schemas, choosing from the general class of those person and behavior schemas that are
primed by any behavioral observation. For example, the observational
goal of forming an impression should lead to the selection of schemas that
contain characteristics indicative of personality, such as expressive features of nonverbal behavior (Ekman & Friesen, 1975), stereotypes of
person characteristics (Brigham, 1971; Cohen, 1976), and the observer’s
implicit theory of personality (IFT) (Wishner, 1960; Rosenberg & Sedlak,
1972). Alternatively,
observing behavior in order to learn a task should
activate a set of schemas containing features and feature relations relevant to task performance, such as nonexpressive aspects of nonverbal
behavior, the relation between the actor and features of the nonsocial
environment, and the temporal order in which the actions occur (Schank
& Abelson, 1977; Schmidt, 1976).
Consider how goal-selected schemas influence the processing of information by (a) an observer who tries to form an impression of an actor and
(b) an observer who tries to learn the task an actor performs. The manner
in which schemas may influence processing at three phases (i.e., attention, integration, and memory) can best be understood in terms of an
activation model of processing. First, each observer’s activated schemas
should determine the behavioral features to which he will attend in order
to achieve his goal. Consequently, the stream of ongoing behavior may
sometimes be “chunked up” differently by the two observers as goalrelated information is attended to by each. For example, the impressionforming observer may search for information about “facial expression”
features (e.g., mouth, eyes) in order to determine which particular facial
expression schema fits the data (e.g., a smiling face).’ However, since
facial features are probably irrelevant to the task being learned, the
task-learning observer is less likely to have activated “facial expression”
schemas.
r Readers familiar
with the facial expression
literature
will note that some investigators
have identified
more than a hundred
facial muscles which contribute
to facial expression
(Ekman
& Friesen,
1975). Our description
of a “facial expression”
schema is superficial
in
order to provide
a clear example.
It is assumed that facial expression
schemas are complex
and require
elaborate
description.

After information is extracted from the stream of behavior, each observer presumably interprets the information
within the structure provided by his goal-determined
schemas. These schemas provide a pattern
of connections between the features extracted from the behavior observation, contributing
meaning to these features. For instance, the tasklearning observer might interpret the behavior of “writing
on the
blackboard” as part of a schema for “writing the agenda of the meeting.”
The observer may have multiple task-relevant
schemas or “scripts”
(Schand & Abelson, 1977) for this event, e.g., “writes the entire agenda
before the meeting” vs “writes the agenda throughout the meeting.” On
the other hand, the impression-forming
observer might instead interpret
the chairperson’s behavior from within a schema containing expressive
characteristics
(for example, “very neat handwriting”
might be associated with preciseness in other expressive characteristics).
Finally, the same schemas that are activated during observation of the
actor are presumed to affect the observer’s memory in two ways. First,
they influence which information
is abstracted and stored in memory
through their mediating effects on the attention to and interpretation
of
the original material. Second, memory is assumed to be a reconstructive
process (Norman,
1976). When the observer tries to reconstruct the
stream of behavior, the goal-specified schemas are, to some degree,
activated and thus may “fill in” features or relationships that either have
decayed since the initial observation or were never actually present in the
behavior. Thus, if the impression-forming
observer remembered that the
actor was “friendly,”
his schema for “friendly”
might activate the feature of “a cheerful voice,” even if he had actually never heard the actor’s
voice (e.g., his judgment being based upon the actor’s facial expressions
and posture). However, as the task-learning observer probably never
formed the judgment that the actor was “friendly,”
he would probably
not incorrectly remember that the actor’s voice was cheerful. Whether he
would remember details about the actor’s face and posture should depend
upon the relation between those features and the schemas activated by his
observational
goal. This reasoning leads to the prediction
that an
impression-forming
observer may at times be less accurate about
personality-related
features than may observers with other goals.
The application of a schema activation framework to describe the
operation of observational goals has implications for previous research in
two areas: the unitization
of the stream of behavior and impression
formation (IPT).
Unitization of the Stream of Behavior
In a series of studies by Newtson and his colleagues (Newtson, 1973;
Newtson, 1976), subjects were instructed to divide the stream of an
actor’s behavior into meaningful actions or “units.”
To explain this

unitization process, Newtson, Engquist, and Bois (1977) suggested that
behavior perception be seen as an instance of Neisser’s (1976) “perceptual
cycling theory” in which the perceiver monitors features of the actor’s
behavior and defines changes in these features as actions.
Our model of behavioral observation is consistent with Newtson’s
approach, but it differs in two ways.2 First, Newtson describes an on-line
feature selection process while our treatment emphasize the high-level
schema selection function of the observational
goal. Newtson (1976)
states that an observer’s set may influence unitization; we have described
a possible mechanism (i.e., a structure and processing steps) whereby an
observer’s goals may affect the perception of behavioral units. Second,
Newtson primarily addresses the perception of behavior while our description of behavior processing includes the interpretation
of and the
memory for behavior as well as perception.
Interpretation

of and Memory for Behavior

Reliance on IPT in impression formation. Viewing the research on
implicit personality theory (Hastorf, Schneider, & Polefka, 1970; Rosenberg & Sedlak, 1972) through the schema structure and processing
framework presented here suggests a potentially interesting new approach
to this body of literature. Implicit personality theory is seen in the present
treatment as a high-level schema representing the interrelationship
between traits (e.g., “friendly”
is related to “warm”).
Each trait represented in IPT is a lower level schema containing behaviors which are
indicative of the trait (e.g., “friendly”
is indicated by “smiles broadly,“
“talks to strangers”). When individuals observe someone in order to form
an impression, their IPT schema is primed. When an observer sees an
actor perform one or more actions indicative of a particular trait, the trait
is activated and this activation spreads to related traits in the IPT structure. “Activation”
is used here to mean the stimulation of a concept or
feature that is stored in semantic memory. (See Collins & Loftus, 1975
and Wyer & Carlston, 1979, for examples of spreading activation models.)
Once a trait has been activated, the subsequent identification
of traitrelated actions is facilitated.
A controversy exists in the literature about whether the structure apparent in an observer’s ratings of behavior is more reflective of the
knowledge structure of the observer (e.g., IPT) or the behavior of the
person observed (D’Andrade,
1965; Dombusch, Hastorf, Richardson,
Muzzy, & Vreeland, 1965; Shweder, 1977). This debate is stimulated by
evidence that the pattern of relations among trait ratings of actual persons
is very similar to the semantic relatedness of the traits, considered inde2 Our acceptance of the position of Newtson et al. (1977) should be qualified somewhat.
We do not yet endorse nor reject their claims that breakpoints are the points in the stimulus
at which action units are defined.

pendently of their presence in a person (Shweder, 1977). IRT researchers
who claim that the raters of behavior are influenced by their notions about
“what traits go with what” have generally stopped short of describing the
process whereby raters’ implicit knowledge influences the ratings they
give. D’ Andrade (1965) and Shweder (1972,1977) suggest that when raters
make judgment about ratees, they do not estimate the actual frequency of
behavioral co-occurrence. Rather, they rely on other irrelevant ways in
which behaviors are conceptually
related (e.g., meaning similarity or
sequentiality). Implied in D’Andrade’s and Shweder’s descriptions is the
view that behavior is “accurately”
perceived but is then forgotten and
replaced by judgments based upon irrelevant information (e.g., similarity
of meaning). While the processing suggested by a schema framework is
sympathetic in spirit to the suggestion of these theorists, it differs by
assuming that observers’ stored notions of behavioral covariation influence their perception and interpretation of behavior and not simply their
responses to questions of behavioral co-occurrence.
Also novel is our suggestion that an observational goal of forming an
impression primes an observer’s PT. To our knowledge, previous research in IFT has not explicitly considered whether an observer’s goal
should influence his reliance upon PT.
Tusk-learning
schema.
Task-learning schemas may differ qualitatively
from impression-forming
schemas. Some tasks seem to require great
attention to the specifics of behavior detail, with relatively little inference
required of the learner about the meaning of the task or about the actor’s
intentions. In these cases, the schemas that are activated when an observer attempts to learn the task may specify the extensive degree of
detail required and minimize higher level inferences about the task.
In addition, tasks may vary in how novel they are to the observer.
When a task is very novel, a specific schema for that task cannot exist a
priori, so schemas that have been relevant to previously learned tasks will
be activated (e.g., observing how to serve in tennis might activate a
ball-throwing schema). These schemas and other contextual clues should
activate a set of behavioral features that are likely to be relevant to the
task and a set of possible relations between these features. Some empirical support for this claim is the identification
by Newtson et al. (1977) of
the behavioral features that subjects monitored (e.g., right hand, left
forearm) when unitizing the actions in some behavioral sequences. Both
novel tasks and tasks that require little inference making should be minimally susceptible to memory distortions. When existing task schemas are
invoked, those that are the most stereotypic or goal oriented (Schmidt,
1976) (e.g., a used car salesman making a pitch) should promote the most
memory errors.
To assess the utility of a schema framework for behavior perception,
we conducted an experiment in which subjects watched and answered

questions about the behavior of a female actor. As a manipulation
of
observer’s goals, subjects were instructed either to form an impression or
to learn the task of the actor as they observed her. The unitization
measure was used to measure observers’ patterns of attention (Newtson,
1973). Three hypotheses were suggested by the schema framework and
the related processing assumptions. They were:
1. Subjects who are instructed to form an impression will unitize the
stream of behavior differently than will subjects who are instructed to
learn the tasks performed by the actor.
2. Subjects who are instructed to form an impression of the actor will
form impressions that are more similar to an implicit personality theory
structure than will be the impressions formed by subjects who are instructed to learn tasks.
3. Subjects who are instructed to learn tasks will be more accurate at
recalling details of the tasks performed by the actor.
METHOD
Overview
Subjects were 32 female undergraduates who were fulfilling a psychology course requirement. Subjects were instructed either to form an impression of or to learn the tasks
performed by a single female actor as they observed her in a series of videotapes. After
receiving their observational instructions, subjects were told to indicate the “units” of information contained in the stream of the actor’s behavior. After viewing all four experimental tapes, subjects were given a set of dependent measures that corresponded to one
of the two instruction conditions (that is, either memory questions about the actor’s task
behaviors or personality trait ratings). Half of the subjects in each instruction condition answered questions that were consistent with their observational instructions while the other
half answered questions which were inconsistent with their instructions. After a short break,
subjects were then reinstructed with the instructions they had not previously received (i.e.,
impression subjects received task-learning instructions, and vice versa). Subjects watched
and unitized the same tapes again under these new instructions and responded to the second
set of dependent measures. No subjects were given the same instructions nor the same
questions twice: i.e., subjects who answered memory questions after their first viewing gave
trait ratings after their second viewing, and vice versa.

Stimuli
Six behavioral sequences were recorded on videotape, each ranging in length from I .5 to 2
min. Subjects viewed the video portion of the tapes on a 12-in. (.3 m) video monitor. Two
tapes, which featured a different actor than did the four experimental sequences, served as
practice sequences so that subjects could become familiar with the unitizing measure. In one
practice sequence the actress entered the room cheerfully, sat down, and peeled and ate an
orange with apparent pleasure. In the second, she opened a small tool case, removed some
tools, and began to carefully carve a piece of leather.
The four experimental sequences all featured the same female actor engaging in both task
and expressive behavior. In tape A, the seated actor opened a wrapped package containing
an electric clock: smiling, she then rose and plugged the clock into the wall. In tape B, the
actor entered and removed her coat and backpack, took several items out of the pack, and
then wrote a check in her checkbook. In tape C, the seated actor leafed impatiently through

<-----Page 7----->312

a magazine; she then rose and paced back and forth, glancing anxiously at her watch. In tape
D, the seated actor looked at some papers and began to write in a notebook. In apparent
frustration, she rapidly crossed out what she had written, crumpled up the sheets of paper,
and threw them across the room. While these sequences of actions were not intuitively
obvious examples of prototypical task behavior, the task instructions encouraged subjects to
construe the sequence of actions as a task. Highly goal-directed behavior sequences were
avoided in order to minimize the predictability of the sequences.

Procedure
Subjects were seated at a table facing the video monitor with a Datamyte Keyboard in
front of them.
Task instructions.
The task instructions were as follows:
We’re interested in how people remember things that they see other people do.
Say, for example, you want to learn how to serve the ball in tennis. You have to
watch as someone else serves and then remember what the person did so that you
can do it then, or at a later time. I’m going to show you some videotapes of a
woman doing various things. I want you to watch carefully and try to remember
what she did.
Subjects were told that they would be asked to answer detailed questions about her task
behavior in the sequences and to give ratings of their confidence. They were told that we
were interested in accuracy.
Impression
instructions.
The impression instructions were as follows:
We’re interested in how people form impressions of other individuals by just
watching them. Say, for example, a person is sitting on the grass across the plaza
from you, talking to someone. By watching them you can get an idea of what kind
of person he or she is.
Subjects were told that they would be asked to answer questions about the personality of
the actor and to give ratings of their confidence. To equate for the accuracy test that subjects
in the task condition were expecting, subjects were told that their responses would be
compared to those of some clinical judges to determine how well they had agreed with the
judges.
After receiving one of the two sets of instructions, all subjects were instructed in the
unitizing task. A “unit” was ambiguously defined so that subjects would impose their own
interpretations when performing the task. Subjects were told:
We’re also interested in how you get out the information that you’re trying to
remember from these behavior sequences. What I’d like you to do is to break up
the tapes for me into the units or chunks of information that you find most helpful
in trying “to remember what the person did” (“to form an impression of the
person”). In this way, you can show us where you get your information from the
behavior sequences.
Subjects were shown how to indicate, by depressing a button on the Datamyte Keyboard,
when they felt one unit had ended and another had begun. The Datamyte recorded the
amount of time (to the nearest second) that had elapsed between each press. The onset of
each sequence was synchronized with the starting of the Datamyte clock so that unit
placement comparisons would be meaningful. After subjects familiarized themselves with
the task on the two practice tapes, they unitized while watching the four experimental

<-----Page 8----->OBSERVATIONAL

313

sequences. The order in which subjects viewed the tapes was counterbalanced across the
instructions and rating conditions.
After viewing and unitizing the series of tapes, the subjects were presented with one ofthe
two dependent measures. That is, half of the subjects in each instruction condition were
tested for recognition memory of detailed task behaviors from all four tapes; while the other
half completed a series of trait rating scales. After these were completed, subjects
were
given a short break.
Upon resumption of the experiment, subjects were told that they woutd now be doing
something different. Subjects were then given the observational instructions (i.e., task or
impression) they had not received in the first half of the experiment. Under these new
instructions, they watched and unitized all of the behavior sequences again. After watching
the series of tapes for the second time, subjects filled out the dependent measure (i.e., trait
ratings or task behavior questions) that they had not completed after the tirst viewing.
Thus, the subjects viewed the videotapes under both the impression-forming and the
task-learning instructions, and they were assigned dependent measures that either were
consistent with these instructions on both viewings (impression instructions-impression
questions, task instructions-memory questions) or were inconsistent with their instructions
on both viewings (impression instructions-memory questions, task instructions-impression
questions). The orders of receiving instructions and dependent measures were counterbalanced across subjects. This allowed a direct within-subject comparison of the effects of
observational goal on unitization while counterbalancing across subjects for possible orderof-instruction effects.

Dependent Measures
To score the unitizing measure, each subject’s Datamyte record was interpreted by an
accessory device attached to a PDP-I2 computer. The location of each unit boundary was
described by the number of seconds that had elapsed between the onset of the videotape and
the button press. For example, one impression subject’s record for Tape I might have
looked like “13,41,58,96,
103, 118,” indicating unit boundaries at I3 set, 41 set, etc. This
record thus provided information about both the number and the location in time of subjects’
button presses.
Memory
for task behavior. Subjects were asked a series of eight binary, forced choice
questions about details of the tasks the actor performed. Two questions were relevant to
each of the four tapes. Half of the items described action patterns that occurred in one of the
tapes and half described action patterns that did not occur. The choice of a small number of
memory questions was made in part to avoid confusion between actions that occurred in
different sequences. Questions were chosen to assess subjects’ accuracy for the kinds of
behavioral features that were implied in the instructions. For example, one question referring to the pacing sequence was: “Did she look at the newspaper while sitting on the table?“,
which asks about the location of her gaze. Another question, which referred to the paperwriting sequence, was: *‘Did she throw the first piece of paper with her left hand?” Confidence ratings for each question were collected on a 9-point confidence-rating scale from
“not at all” to “extremely.”
Personality
trair ratings. Eight trait terms were taken from the Rosenberg and Sedlak
(1972) two-dimensional scaling configuration. The choice of the particular trait terms was
based upon two criteria. First, their relevance to the actor’s behavior had face validity. Also,
two trait terms were chosen from the extremes of both the intellectual good-bad dimension
and the social good-bad dimension to provide a range of characteristics. Specifically, the
intellectual good-bad trait terms were industrious,
intelligent, irresponsible,
and superficial
and the social good-bad terms were tolerant, good-natured,
pessimistic,
and dominating.
Confidence ratings were collected after each trait rating using the confidence scale described

<-----Page 9----->314

COHEN AND EBBESEN

above. The responses were made orally and tape recorded, and the latency of each response
was later computed.3 Subjects were unaware that the latencies of their trait responses were
being measured.
Co-occurrence
judgments.
In order to measure the IPT structure influencing subjects’ trait
ratings of the actor, judgments of hypothetical co-occurrence were collected, as in previous
IPT research (Rosenberg & Sedlak, 1972). Ten undergraduates from the same population as
the previous subjects judged all possible pairs of the eight traits in terms of how likely they
were to co-occur in a hypothetical person. Subjects rated the likelihood on a IO-point scale
from “not at all” to “highly likely” that, for example, a person who is intelligent is also
pessimistic. The direction of the specific question that was asked about each pair of traits
(i.e., whether subjects were asked whether “a person who is intelligent is also pessimistic”
or whether ‘&a person who is pessimistic is also intelligent”) was randomly determined.4

RESULTS
Units of Perception

The pattern
of the unit placement data strongly supported the
hypothesis that subjects who were instructed to form an impression of the
actor would unitize the stream of her behavior differently than subjects
who were instructed to learn how to perform the tasks that she was
engaged in. These differences were both quantitative and qualitative. That
is, subjects used a greater number of units when they were given task
instructions, M = 11.1, than when they were given impression formation
instructions, A4 = 6.1, F( 1,30) = 39.16, p < .OOl. Twenty-nine of the
thirty-two subjects used smaller, more frequent units when watching
under task instructions than when watching under impression instructions. Neither the order of viewing under the two instruction sets nor the
content of the tapes (averaged across instruction conditions) had an effect
upon the number of units subjects used.
The unitization patterns were investigated by determining whether the
boundaries of the units in the two conditions lined up. Previous research
(Newtson, 1973) has investigated the unitization patterns produced by
two sets of subjects under instructions that differed only in the size of the
units subjects were to define (i.e., fine vs gross units). Newtson (1973)
found that subjects under “fine unit” instructions produced smaller units
within the boundaries of the units produced by subjects under “gross
unit” instructions.
However, since subjects in the two observational
conditions of the present study were expected to attend to qualitatively
3 Length of latency was determined by a program operating on a PDP-9 conputer which
measured the latency between a signal given by the experimenter as she presented the
subject with the rating and the time the subject responded. Differences in comprehension
time for reading the rating were determined to be relatively unimportant.
4 Unpublished data from our laboratory indicates that co-occurrence ratings that are
made in the two directions (i.e., “a person who is A is also B” and “a person who is B is also
A”) are very highly correlated. Since it was unclear how subjects would use information about
slight asymmetries in trait association, we chose to randomly sample the relationship and ask
for judgments in one direction only for each trait pair.

different information, the two unitization patterns should not line up. That
is, subjects in the two conditions should unitize qualitatively
different
information,
rather than simply “subdividing”
the same information into
smaller categories.
Since all subjects viewed the four tapes under both the impression and
task instructions, it was possible to compare directly the correspondence
of unit boundaries in these two conditions for each individual subject. A
measure of the correspondence of the unit boundaries across the two
instruction conditions (“hit rate”) was computed separately for each
subject on each of the four tapes. “Hit rate” was defined as the proportion of the unit boundaries identified by a subject under impression instructions that coincided with the subject’s unit boundaries under task
instructions. The hit rate was computed by dividing the number of “hits”
for a given tape by the total number of units the subject defined under
impression instructions for that tape. Computed hit rate could thus range
from 0.0 (no unit boundaries lined up) to 1.0 (all of the impression unit
boundaries lined up with the units in the task condition). The impression
units were used in the denominator since there were almost always fewer
of them and they constrained the number of possible hits.
To calculate hit rate, intervals of both l- and S-set duration were
defined by dividing the tape into contiguous segments beginning at the
onset of the tape. A “hit” was defined as any instance in which a subject
placed a unit boundary under task instructions in the same interval (i.e., 1
or 5 set) into which she also placed a unit boundary under impression
instructions. Hit rates were computed for both I- and 5-set intervals for
every subject and for each tape.
The overall mean hit rate was .22 for I-set mtervals (.24, .20, .19, .25
for Tapes A, B, C, and D, respectively) and .52 for the 5-set intervals
(.57, .44, .4g, .60 for Tapes A, B, C, and D, respectively). The construction of 95% confidence intervals indicated that the mean hit rates differed
significantly (p < .05) from both 0.0 and 1.0. Thus, the unit boundaries
under task instructions lined up with the impression unit boundaries in
less than 25% of the instances under a strict interval criterion (i.e., 1 set)
and about 50% of the time under a more lenient interval criterion (i.e., 5
set).
An interpretation of the hit rate data must take the following factors into
account. First, it is unlikely, due both to random error and to variability in
a subject’s reaction times, that we would have found data demonstrating
either perfect agreement or perfect disagreement across the two conditions (i.e., a hit rate of either 1.0 or 0.0). Nonetheless, even in the lenient
criterion analysis in which two unit boundaries that occurred within the
same interval of 5 set were considered a hit, the hit rate only reached
50%. Hit rate was less than half that in the 1-set interval analysis.
Second, a 5-set interval is large enough that subjects could have unitized

two different events within the same interval when viewing under the two
instructions. These two unit boundaries would have been scored as a hit,
thus overestimating
the “true” hit rate. Overall, since the unitizing data
indicated that at least half and perhaps three-quarters of subjects’ unit
boundaries did not line up across the two conditions, we concluded that
these data differed from previous unitization results (Newtson, 1976). The
prediction that subjects would unitize qualitatively
different information
in the two instruction conditions was supported.
A between-subject analysis of variance was performed on the hit rates
to determine whether there was an effect of the order in which subjects
received the set instructions or of the order in which they responded to
the dependent variables. There was neither an effect of instructional set
order nor was there a significant interaction between the two factors.
However, there was a main effect of dependent variable order, which
reached significance in the 1-set interval analysis, F(1,28) = 4.44, p <
.05, and approached significance in the 5-set interval analysis, F( 1,28) =
3.54, p < .08.5 The hit rate was higher when subjects made impression
ratings first than when they performed task recall first. Table 1 presents
the mean hit rates for both the 1-set and the 5-set interval analysis.
Apparently those subjects in both initial instruction conditions who
made impression judgments first (i.e., in between the two viewings) had
unitization
patterns that were more similar across the two viewings.
Although the effect appears to be larger for subjects who watched originally with task instructions, this difference was not significant. A possible
explanation of the results is that forming an impression of the actress
required subjects to review her behavior. A review of her behavior may
well have increased the salience of the events that subjects encoded
5 The results were the same when an arc sine transformation was applied to the hit rates.
The same results were also obtained when hit rate was adjusted to account for possible
chance hits by subtracting, from each subject’s hit rate, the number of hits that would have
occurred if her task units were randomly distributed.

during the first viewing and thus led to the unitization of these same
events during the second viewing. Subjects who instead answered taskrelated questions between viewings may have reviewed only the specific
aspects of the actress’ behavior that were required by the questions. If
their review of her behavior was more limited, fewer of the previously
encoded events would have been made salient and thus have influenced
their second unitization. This explanation is of course tentative and requires further investigation.
Personality

Trait Ratings

It is hypothesized that subjects’ impressions of the actor would be more
influenced by their IPT schemas under impression instructions than under
task-learning instructions. Although individuals may vary in their individual IPT structures, it was assumed that the shared aspects of the
semantic structure would compare reasonably well to the structures of
individual subjects. Matrices were constructed from the trait ratings of
subjects in the two instruction conditions by correlating (across subjects
within an instruction condition) all possible pairs of trait ratings (Rosenberg & Sedlak, 1972). In order to compare the structure in each of the two
trait-rating matrices (Tables 2 and 3) with the semantic co-occurrence
matrix produced by an independent group of subjects (Table 4), the three
matrices were correlated, two at a time, with each other. The trait terms
in Tables 2, 3, and 4 are grouped by favorability.
The pattern of trait ratings generated by impression subjects was expected to be more highly correlated with the shared semantic structure of
the traits than was the pattern generated by task subjects. While the
former correlation was in fact higher, r = .48, n = 28, p < .Ol, than the
latter, r = .30, n = 28, p < .lO, this difference was not significant.
Nonetheless, the correlation between the patterns of ratings generated by
subjects in the two instructional conditions was virtually zero, r = .08, n
= 28, ns, suggesting that there were major structural differences between
the two sets of ratings. Moreover, this latter correlation was significantly
less than the correlation between the impression matrix and the cooccurrence matrix, t(25) = 1.93, p < .05, but was not significantly less
than the correlation between the task matrix and the co-occurrence matrix, t(25) = 1.13, ns.
A finer-grained analysis of the structure was provided by comparing the
correlations between trait terms that were similar in favorability with
those that were dissimilar in favorability (see Tables 2 and 3). There were
12 correlations computed from traits that were similar in favorability (i.e.,
6 among favorable traits and 6 among unfavorable traits) and 16 correlations computed from traits that were dissimilar in favorability (i.e., those
computed between favorable and unfavorable traits). The co-occurrence
matrix (Table 4) shows that traits that were similar in favorability had

relatively high co-occurrence ratings (average rating = 6.22) while traits
that were dissimilar in favorability had relatively low co-occurrence ratings
(average rating = 3.89). These average ratings differed significantly, t(26) =
6.33,~ < .OOl. If subjects’ trait ratings reflected this IPT structure, the signs
of the correlations among traits that were similar in favorability should
have been positive while those that were dissimilar in favorability should
have been negative. The number of correlation coefficients whose signs
matched the predicted pattern was tabulated within each instruction condition. Consistent with our expectation, the impression instruction matrix
contained 24 correlations (86%) that fit the expected pattern, while in the
task instruction matrix only 17 correlations (61%) fit the expected pattern.
This difference was marginally significant, X2 = 3.28, p < .08.
There were no systematic differences between the two instruction
conditions in average ratings of the actress along the eight trait dimensions. Specifically, a multivariate analysis of variance performed on the
eight sets of trait ratings produced no overall effects of either instructional
analysis of variance
conditions or order of viewing. 6 A multivariate
performed on subjects’ confidence in their trait ratings as a function of
instructions and order of viewing also yielded no significant effects.
It was expected that there might be more intersubject agreement among
impression subjects in giving their trait ratings than among task subjects,
assuming that impression subjects attended to similar behavioral features
and integrated them into a common IPT structure. As a measure of
agreement, mean standard deviations for each of the eight trait ratings
were computed across subjects within each group. To our surprise, task
subjects agreed with one another nonsignificantly more (mean SD = 1S6)
than did impression subjects, mean SD = 1.79; t(7) = 1.89; p < .09. A
possible explanation for this result will be discussed later.
Response futencies. Subjects in the two instruction conditions did not
differ in their mean Iatencies when responding with trait ratings, M = 3.76
set and 3.70 set, under task and impression conditions respectively,
F( 1,28) = 3.96, ns. The relationship between subjects’ latency in making a
trait rating and their degree of confidence was of particular interest, as
two different results have been reported in the literature. A negative
correlation between latency and confidence has been found consistently
in the choice and judgment literature (Pachella, 1974) such that a subject’s
confidence in a judgment increases as the speed with which they make the
judgment decreases. However, Sternberg (1969) has found that response
latency increases as subjects review more pieces of information in memory. A thorough memory scan for relevant information should also lead to
more confidence in a given response Impression subjects tended to be

more confident when they gave their trait ratings rapidly, Y = - .2 1, n = 16,
while task subjects were more confident when they took longer to answer,
Y = .53, II = 16. These correlations differ significantly, z = 2.04, p < .05. It is
reasonable that if impression subjects had already formed an impression of
the actor, traits that were related to their impression could be answered
rapidly and with higher confidence. In contrast since task subjects presumably did not make personality judgments when watching the actress, they
may have first searched their memory for trait-related information when
asked to make ratings and then integrated the implications of this information. The time required for this process may increase with the amount of
information involved. If so, and if subjects are more confident of ratings
that are based on more information and thus take more time to make, the
positive relation between confidence and latency in this condition would be
expected.
Memory

for Task Behavior

Questions

Although all subjects observed the actor once with each set of instructions, only half answered memory questions just after viewing the tapes
under task instructions. As predicted, subjects who observed under task
instructions were better at discriminating
which task-related behaviors
actually occurred (M = 70% correct) than were impression subjects, M =
58%, F(1,28)

= 4.94, p < .05.

An analysis of variance demonstrated
that recall accuracy was not
dependent upon the number of times the tape had been viewed previously, nor did the effect of numh?r of viewings vary over instructional
conditions.
Although impression subjects were less accurate in remembering taskrelated behavioral details, they were no less confident about their responses, F < 1.00. As with the accuracy data, order of viewing had no
effect on observers’ confidence ratings.
DISCUSSION
When viewed together, the results of this study supported our hypotheses. First, observers who watched the videotapes with the goal of forming an impression of the actor unitized the stream of behavior into qualitatively different actions or events than did observers who watched in order
to learn the tasks she performed. Unlike previous unitization research in
which observers’ goals were not manipulated, the unit boundaries of the
events generally did not line up congruently across the two instruction
conditions. Second, the structure of the personality impressions formed
by the impression set subjects showed a somewhat stronger similarity to
an implicit personality theory structure than did the structure found in the
task subjects’ impressions. (This conclusion is tentative, as the difference

<-----Page 18----->OBSERVATIONAL

GOALS

AND

SCHEMA

ACTIVATION

323

between the two estimates of relatedness was not significant.) Finally,
task subjects were more accurate at recalling task-related events in the
stream of the actor’s behavior than were impression subjects.
In what ways do the data support and elaborate upon the assumptions
of the schema framework? The assumption that the two observational
goals activated sets of schemas which contained different actions or
features is supported by the difference in the number of units defined by
subjects in the two conditions. The hit rate measure indicated that a large
proportion of the time the unit boundaries defined by subjects under the
two observation instructions did not line up. Apparently subjects were
attending to different features or aspects of the actor’s behavior rather
than dividing the “same” events into finer subdivisions. When unit boundaries did coincide, subjects apparently interpreted and remembered the
events within the schemas provided by their respective goals. This is
supported by the different patterns of responses the two groups of subjects gave on the task-related questions and in the impressions that they
formed.
For impression subjects, implicit theories of intertrait relationships
(i.e., their shared IPT schemas) seemed to act as one type of high-level
schema. This group’s pattern of intertrait correlations suggests that the
shared IPT schema contributed to the structure in subjects’ personality
ratings of the actor. However, these subjects were less likely to have
activated task-related schemas and, due to some combination
of attention, interpretation,
and memory processes, were therefore less able to
recognize task-related details accurately (e.g., with which hand did she
throw the paper?).
Task subjects, however, used a set of schemas that enabled them to
recall more accurately the details of the actor’s task-related behavior.
These subjects presumably interpreted and stored the information about
the actor in the form dictated by their task schemas: e.g., they may have
stored a part of a sequence as “picks up paper with right hand, throws it,
etc.” When some of these subjects were then asked to describe the
actor’s behavior in trait terms, the latency data suggest that they first
reviewed her actions in the form in which they were stored and then
applied trait labels to them.
Implications

for

Unitization

Theory and Research

Because instructional set was manipulated within subject, it was possible to determine whether an individual subject used different units when
watching the same behavioral sequence under two different instructions.
Ninety-one percent of the subjects used a greater number of units when
observing under task instructions than when observing under impression
instructions. The lack of an order effect upon the number of units subjects

<-----Page 19----->324

COHEN

AND

EBBESEN

used indicated that subjects apparently attended to the same amount of
goal-relevant information whether or not they had viewed the tapes previously.
Although there were fewer units of impression information than task
information in these behavioral sequences, there probably are sequences
for which this relationship would not hold. Examples might be sequences
that contain highly emotional
behavior, interpersonal
interaction
sequences, and/or sequences that contain verbal in addition to nonverbal
behavior. Sequences such as these are likely to provide an observer with a
great deal of information that is relevant to forming an impression. Observers might unitize the sequences into impression units that are equal to or
even exceed task units in number.
The hit rate data demonstrated that the congruence of the boundaries
defined by individual subjects under the two sets of instructions was
generally low. These data are important
because they support the
hypothesis (along with the number-of-units
data) that an individual subject attended to different information under the two sets of instructions.
We judged the I-set interval analysis to be more appropriate than the 5set analysis as it appeared that two different potential units occasionally
occurred within a 5-set interval. Future research might attempt to describe empirically the events that subjects unitize (Newtson et al., 1977)
and the variability between subjects in unitizing the same event. This
might help to determine the appropriate interval size.
As indicated previously, our data provide the first empirical support for
Newtson’s (1976) suggestion that an observer’s set may affect the unitization process. We believe that our results underscore the importance of
identifying and describing the cognitive processing of the observer in
order to evolve a theoretical understanding of behavior perception and
unitization.
In fact, taking into account the observer’s goal may help to
explain some data from a study by Newtson (1973). Contrary to his
prediction, Newtson (1971) found that observers who expected to see the
actor again used fewer, larger units than those who did not expect a future
encounter. Thinking that they were to see the actor again may have
prompted the observers to form an impression of him/her (Berscheid,
Graziano, Monson, & Dermer, 1976), resulting in fewer, larger units.
The goals assigned to the subjects in this study were those that observers select in the course of everday interaction.
That is, people frequently learn to perform tasks by observing others (Bandura, 1965). And,
person perception theorists have suggested that forming impressions of
people enables us to imagine that we have more control over our interactions with them (Hastorf et al., 1970). Furthermore,
there is a long
tradition of asking subjects to form an impression of a stimulus person in
previous research (Asch, 1946). However, future research might investigate additional observational goals (e.g., evaluation of the actor for a

<-----Page 20----->OBSERVATIONAL

AND

particular job, clinical intervention,
or counseling) and determine their
relationship to those studied here. Two additional issues for future study
are what determines the observational goal that an observer will adopt,
and whether observers are always aware of their observational goals.

for

Impression formation.
Previous research has not been concerned with
specifying the circumstances under which observers should rely upon
their implicit personality theories. It was hypothesized here that subjects
who were instructed to form an impression would be more influenced by
their implicit personality theories than would subjects who observed to
learn a task. The data offer tentative support for this prediction. The
impression subjects’ intertrait correlation matrix was reliably related to
the semantic co-occurrence matrix, and this relation was nonsignificantly
greater than the corresponding relation involving task subjects. Further,
the two intertrait matrices generated by task and impression subjects did
not correlate with one another; in fact, the impression subjects’ matrix
was more similar to the IFT structure than to the structure in the task
subjects’ matrix. If the increased WI influence on impression-forming
observers proves reliable, it suggests that the degree of impact of observers’ implicit theories of personality depends partially upon their observational goals. Ironically, it appears that observers who try to learn a task
will subsequently make trait judgments that are less influenced by their
preconceived notions about trait and behavior co-occurrence or, more
generally, are less constrained by their stereotypes about personality.
If these data provide tentative evidence that impression subjects were
more influenced by IPT, how can we explain the result that impression
subjects produced more between-subject variability than did task subjects? Initially, it might appear that these observers should agree with one
another completely if they all viewed the tapes with the same goal in
mind. However, several factors might contribute to the variability in these
ratings. First, as the tremendous amount of information contained in the
stream of the actor’s behavior probably outstrips the processing capacity
of any individual (Miller, 1956), it is unlikely that many observers will
encode all of the same details. Second, although there is general agreement among subjects about the semantic relatedness (or hypothetical
covariation) of traits, there may be less agreement about the behavioral
features contained in the schemas they have constructed for each of these
traits. Finally, as suggested by Neisser (1976) and Newtson et al. (1977),
the processing of the stream of behavior may involve an interaction
between the observer’s already activated schemas and the information
collected on-line from the actor’s behavior. Given these assumptions, it
seems reasonable that one observer, noting (and presumably unitizing) a

<-----Page 21----->326

COHEN

AND

EBBESEN

slight frown on the actor’s face, began to regard her as an unhappy person
and thus attended to additional negative social features. Another observer, focusing initially on a smile on the actor’s face, might have
regarded her as pleasant and thus proceeded to encode positive social
information.
As a result, the first observer may have judged her as
“pessimistic,”
while the second observer may have judged her as
“happy”
or “optimistic.”
Therefore, differences in the attributes that
observers initially noticed may have led to divergent final impressions.
This is an interesting mechanism
that is consistent with the welldocumented primacy effect in person perception (Anderson, 1965).
It is interesting to consider the process that task subjects may have
gone through when asked to make trait ratings of the actor. Assuming that
the information they had stored about the actor was in the form of task
units, they may have reconstructed at least some part of the stream of
behavior and used that as a basis for making trait judgments. As they went
through the list of trait ratings one at a time, they may have searched
through the behaviors in memory for evidence relating to each rating and
integrated the implications
of this evidence into a single judgment. The
time required to perform this integration and the confidence in the judgment resulting from it may both increase with the amount of information
extracted. If so, this would explain the fact that task subjects’ confidence
in their judgments increased with the time it took to make them. In
addition, the tendency to seek information pertaining to each trait separately may have also decreased the correlation of trait co-occurrence
ratings with the IPT structure, as the results also suggest.
Though we have not described a task-related structure comparable to
IPT here, there are other suggestions that such task-related schemas may
exist (cf. Abelson, 1975; Schank & Abelson, 1977). Probably task
schemas can be described in terms of degree of similarity to one another
in the same way that traits can be described as similar or likely to
co-occur. For example, the schema for the task “chairs a meeting” can be
considered more similar to the task “gives a lecture” than it is to the task
“cooks a meal.” The existence of high-level task structure is important
because it suggests that task schemas do not contain only detailed, concrete information about behavior (e.g., “picks up coffee mug with right
hand”). As noted before, observers may have expectations about the
order of events in many task sequences, particularly those which occur
frequently or are relatively goal oriented.
There are interesting implications of this study for research and theory
in person perception. First, adopting a schema framework provides a
theoretical language for describing how observers’ goals influence their
processing of the stream of behavior. It is assumed that an individual’s
knowledge about human behavior is organized into schemas and that this
knowledge
includes
information
about task-related
actions and

327

personality-related
behavior. The observer’s attention, interpretation,
and memory for the information contained in the stream of behavior may
be influenced by these cognitive schemas.
Viewing IFT as a cognitive schema that influences information processing during the observation of behavior may lead to a better understanding
of its role in impression formation. An important goal of future research in
behavior observation
would be to specify the content of relevant
schemas. For example, knowlege of the trait and behavior relationships
contained in an individual’s implicit theory of personality should allow for
the testing of more specific predictions about the impression he may form
of an actor (Rosenberg, 1976).
The unitizing measure is a useful method for allowing subjects to define
the events in the stream of behavior. It should be clear that the measure
simply indicates the subject’s perception that an action has occurred at a
given point in time. Since more than one feature of a behavior may occur
simultaneously,
the unitizing measure cannot distinguish which feature
the subject is attending to. Future research might experiment with modifying the unitizing technique to allow a subject to respond to multiple
features of behavior (Schmidt, Note 1).
Finally, the impression and memory results indicated that the same
sequence of behavior was interpreted and remembered differently by
observers with different goals. This finding has obvious relevance for
situations where agreement between observers is important: at a courtroom trial, a job interview, or in a normal social interaction. Thus,
observational goals may have important consequences for the interpretation of and memory for behavior.
