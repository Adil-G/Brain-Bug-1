ABSTRACT This study deals with policy instruments supporting high-tech start-up activity. It is
based on the Israeli experience with two specific government programmes: Yozma, which
triggered the emergence of the venture capital industry, and the technological incubators
programme. These programmes had significant impact on the development of the high-tech
cluster in Israel. While venture capital has positive impact on the growth and strength of hightech clusters, it has also significant drawbacks, such as narrow geographical distribution of hightech activities and narrow technological diversification. In this study we will analyse whether the
interaction between Yozma programme and the technological incubators programme, reduced
these drawbacks. We will examine whether the technological incubators in peripheral areas in
Israel succeeded in attracting high-tech start-up activity as well as venture capital investments,
and whether the incubators were supporting more diversified technological fields than the venture
capital industry. In addition, we will try to determine whether cooperation between venture
capitals and incubators led to more balanced investments patterns in terms of geographical
distribution and technological diversification. Our empirical work is based on a population of
3747 Israeli high-tech firms, established between 1991 and 2004. In analysing this data we will
attempt to determine whether venture capitals and incubators have dissimilar effectiveness in
supporting start-ups and different technological and geographical preferences. The findings
suggest that while venture capital-backed firms have higher success rates, their activities are
more concentrated in central areas. In contrast, the technological incubators proved successful in
attracting activity to peripheral areas and to less popular technologies, but their success rates
are very low. Finally, the findings suggest that incubator graduates that received venture capital
financing had significantly improved results.

Introduction
This paper deals with policy instruments supporting high-tech clusters in general and
specifically start-up companies. The information presented here is based on the Israeli
experience with two specific government programmes: Yozma, which triggered the emergence of the venture capital (VC) industry, and the technological incubators programme.
These programmes address specific system failures of the entrepreneurship process—the
early stage equity gap and the lack of complementary assets in start-up firms.
Avnimelech and Teubal (2006, 2008) suggest that the Israeli Innovation and Technology
Policy (ITP) significantly influenced the successful development of that country’s startup-intensive high-tech cluster.1 Haour (2005) argues, “Israel is the world’s most vital
place for entrepreneurship. In fact, as a percentage of GDP [gross domestic product],
Israel has the world’s highest level of VC; it invests (1.2%) twice as much as the
USA”.2 However, very limited attention has been paid to the side effects of the emergence
of the VC industry and the growth of the start-up-intensive high-tech cluster in Israel, such
as geographical distribution and technological diversification of high-tech activities.
Therefore, we believe that analysing these issues and the interaction between the different
ITPs implemented in Israel may yield significant policy implications.
Many researchers have emphasized the positive impact of VC industries on the growth
and strength of high-tech clusters (e.g. Florida & Kenney, 1988; Gompers & Lerner, 1999,
2001; Kortum & Lerner, 2000; Schwartz & Bar-El, 2006, 2007; and many others).
However, there are also significant drawbacks related to a high-tech cluster with a dominant VC industry. We will focus on two of these drawbacks: narrowing the geographical
distribution of high-tech activities, leading to additional reduction of high-tech activity in
the peripheral areas (Schwartz, 2006; Schwartz & Bar-El, 2006), and restricting technological diversification—avoiding investments in technological areas and activities that
either require long development periods or have only a moderate success profile
(Gompers & Lerner, 2000; Lerner, 2002).
In this study we will analyse the interaction between two Israeli targeted programmes in the
area of entrepreneurial high-tech activities—the Yozma programme (1993–1998), which triggered the emergence of the VC industry, and the technological incubators programme (from
1991 to the present), which created 28 technological incubators. In the beginning, the major
focus of the technological incubators programme was to reduce unemployment among scientists and engineers who had immigrated to Israel from the former Soviet Union. Therefore,
while there was no deliberate policy to create these incubators in peripheral areas, many of
them were created in such areas (where most immigrants were located).
We will examine whether the technological incubators had a positive impact on the diffusion of high-tech activity toward more peripheral areas and to less fashionable technological areas. More specifically, we will examine whether the technological incubators in
peripheral areas in Israel succeeded in attracting high-tech start-up activity as well as VC
investments, and whether the incubators were supporting more diversified technological
fields than the VC industry. In addition, we will try to determine whether cooperation
between VCs and incubators offer synergies and added value to their portfolio companies,
and whether their joint investments are more balanced in terms of geographical distribution and technological diversification.
The empirical part of this paper is based on the IVC-online database, which includes
data on over 3500 Israeli high-tech companies established since 1996 and an additional

1000 Israeli high-tech companies established prior to 1996 (since the IVC database was
created in 1996, the data prior to 1996 is less accurate—not all companies closed prior
to 1996 were reachable). This database includes information on each firm’s name, business
description, founding date, technological sector, location, financial rounds, type of investors, founders’ backgrounds, and additional data. Our empirical work is based on a population of 3747 Israeli high-tech firms, established between 1991 and 2004. This population
is divided into an additional three sub-groups: Israeli high-tech firms that received financing from Israeli VCs, Israeli high-tech firms that graduated from technological incubators
and Israeli high-tech firms that graduated from incubators and received financing from
Israeli VCs. The firms in the population are presented according to technological field
and current main location of operation. The current status of these firms is divided into
one of three possible rankings: high success (start-ups that had initial public offerings
(IPOs) or were targets of significant acquisition), moderate success (start-ups that did
not have IPOs and were not targets of significant acquisition, but are still active3), and
failure (start-ups which were closed).
In analysing this data we will attempt to determine whether VCs and incubators have
dissimilar effectiveness in supporting start-ups and different technological and geographical preferences. The findings suggest that while VC-backed firms have higher success
rates, their activities are more concentrated in central areas. Consequently, VC investments increase the economic gap between central areas and peripheral areas. In contrast,
the technological incubators proved successful in attracting activity to peripheral areas and
to less popular technologies, but their success rates are very low. Finally, the findings
suggest that incubator graduates that received VC financing had significantly improved
results.
The rest of the study is organized in the following manner: the next section presents the
role and characteristics of VC investors, which are involved in the financing of start-up
companies. The sub-section discusses location decision of VC investments and their influence on the spatial distribution of high-tech activity. The following sub-section discusses
the impact of VC investments on technological diversification. The third section presents
the role of technological incubators in supporting entrepreneurial activity. The fourth
section presents Israel’s high-tech cluster development in the 1990s and the role of ITP
in this process, with specific attention to Yozma and the technological incubator programmes. The fifth section presents the empirical part of the paper, and the final section
presents the conclusions.

The Role and Characteristics of VC Investors
One of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs when starting a new venture is building a
resource base that will allow them to develop their innovation into a product and penetrate
the market. This challenge is particularly formidable when the innovation is extremely
risky in terms of technology and/or market (Teece, 1986). In addition to difficulties in
securing financial resources, these start-ups also lack significant managerial and business
resources. More specifically, these ventures are in many cases characterized by inexperienced management, lack of business networks and immature systems. The financing of
innovative start-ups is subject to significant problems, such as uncertainty, extreme sensitivity to capital and product market conditions, lack of tangible assets, and asymmetric

information problems (Gompers & Lerner, 1999). Therefore, traditional financial
institutions generally avoid financing innovative start-ups.
However, VCs are financial intermediaries that strive to respond to the needs of startups. The unique VC structure, contracts, practices, and expertise enable them to deal
with asymmetric information problems and to add value to their portfolio companies
(Kaplan & Strömberg, 2001, 2003a, 2003b). VCs are not merely suppliers of capital for
the new ventures, they also add operational value and provide specific expertise and
assets. Their expertise is in their ability to select firms with growth potential (Jain,
1999; Riquelme & Watson, 2002), and to improve their quality by providing them with
the resources they generally lack and by increasing their accessibility to external
resources.
VCs employ their networks not only in evaluating potential deals, but also in building
the companies in which they have invested by providing them with access to networks of
contacts (Branscombe & Auerswald, 2001). Many empirical studies have suggested that
VC-backed companies have improved performance compared to other start-ups (Barry,
1990; Gompers & Lerner, 1999; Megginson & Weiss, 1991).
Location Decisions of VC Investments
VCs are attracted to specific locations with advantages for high-tech activity and with a
high concentration both of start-ups and other venture investors. This is explained by
the special active role played by VC investors. In a recent study, Schwartz and Bar-El
(2006) show the spatial pattern of VC investments based on the Israeli experience.
Their findings reveal that the location behaviour of VC investments differs from that of
high-tech activities in general: they are much more concentrated than the entire hightech industry. As VCs supply managerial assistance in addition to capital, the location
of their investments depends both on factors that influence location of capital and on
factors that influence location of high-tech related activities and resources. Capital is relatively more mobile and is attracted to the location of high-tech activities with the highest
return.
However, VCs as active investors have to remain in frequent contact with the firms
they back. Geographical proximity of the investors to the location of the firms they
back is important both for the selection process and because of added-value activities
(Branscombe & Auerswald, 2001; Powell et al., 2002).
Proximity is also important given the asymmetric information between the investors to
the start-up and the investors’ need for control, in order to reduce the uncertainty of their
investments (Allen, 2002). The ability of VCs to supply their value-added inputs depends
on the regional networks and the quality of their networks, and is greatly assisted by geographical proximity (Zook, 2004). As it is common for several investors to be involved in
each start-up, VCs tend to invest in close proximity to one another. The proximity between
the investors facilitates these interactions and the ability of the investors to be close to the
firms they back.
The Narrow Technological Focus of High-tech Clusters and VC Investments
VC investments tend to be very focused on a few narrow technological areas that are
perceived to have the greatest potential. Thus, the growing importance of VC industries

<-----Page 5----->Entrepreneurial High-tech Cluster Development

in entrepreneurial high-tech clusters, and the increases in VC fundraising in particular
(Gompers & Lerner, 1999), will probably lead to more intense competition for transactions within an existing set of technological fields, rather than to greater diversity in
the technological fields of the companies funded (Lerner, 2002). These patterns of the
narrow-concentration of VC investments are discussed in more detail in Gompers and
Lerner (2000). In general, we can argue that the information and communication technology (ICT) revolution and more specifically the growing importance of the VC industry,
has led to a trend of narrowing the technological concentration in many high-tech clusters.
Therefore, public policy toward entrepreneurial, technological and regional development
should consider these issues and take into account the potential drawbacks related to these
processes.

The Role of the Technological Business Incubator
Beginning in the 1970s, countries began shifting their economic development policies
toward more “entrepreneurial” strategies due to the rise of successful entrepreneurial
high-tech clusters such as the Silicon Valley, and new insights regarding the role of
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in economic growth, regional development
and technological change (Eisinger, 1988; Massey et al., 1992). Subsequently, policymakers began to understand that market failures exist in the process of new technological
venture creation. This led to the development of the business incubation concept
(Campbell, 1989).
Technology business incubators became a popular economic development strategy tool
in the US beginning in the mid-1980s, as policy-makers understood that the vast majority
of new ventures failed as a result of three common problems: lack of capital, poor management skills and insufficient understanding of the marketplace (Lewis, 2001). Since then,
business incubation has proven to be a flexible tool adopted by universities and local
governments to develop diverse industry sectors in urban, suburban, and rural areas in
order to create jobs, wealth and other economic benefits (OECD, 1999).
Business incubators assist new ventures to grow and survive during the early stages,
when they are most vulnerable. The principle of the incubation concept is that premature
ventures require temporary support to gain strength and become more efficient. The role of
business incubators is to provide a supportive environment, where new entrepreneurs
receive training and assistance in business management and marketing, various other
business services, and access to seed capital (Allen & McCluskey, 1990; Peters et al.,
2004). Campbell and Allen (1985) suggest four areas where incubators create value: diagnosis of business needs, selection and monitoring of their tenants, provision of access to
significant business networks to their tenants and provision of access to capital. Smilor
(1987) argues that incubators benefit their portfolio companies in development of credibility, shortening learning curves and access to significant entrepreneurial networks.
Another very important aspect of incubation seems to be the networking4 among
tenants, and between tenants and external regional-related agents (Phillips, 2002). The
main findings regarding the contribution of technology incubators are that most incubators
increase the start-up survival rate and enhance regional development (Smilor & Gill,
1987). Moreover, incubators enhance the entrepreneurial spirit in the region and attract
highly skilled individuals to the area (Vedovello & Godinho, 2003).

Israel’s High-tech Cluster Development and VC Industry Emergence
The development of the Israeli high-tech cluster and the emergence of the VC industry is
probably one of the most successful examples of diffusion of the Silicon Valley model of
VC and start-up-intensive high-tech cluster outside of North America (Bresnahan et al.,
2001; Carmell & de Fontaenet, 2004). The Israeli high-tech cluster resulted from a
process of structural change, which began in the 1970s (Teubal, 1993) and accelerated
during the 1990s (Avnimelech & Teubal, 2006). Since its beginning in 1969, it has
been divided into at least two distinct periods. The first corresponds to the “process of
introduction and diffusion of R&D throughout the business sector”, which was dominated
by mid-tech industries (Teubal, 1993). The second involves the transformation of hightech sectors into an entrepreneurial high-tech cluster model (Avnimelech & Teubal,
2004a, 2004b). The main event in this process is the successful emergence of the VC
industry, which took place during 1993– 2000. This new privately owned infrastructure
to the high-tech cluster was one of the key factors in the transformation of Israel’s formerly
defence-oriented electronics industry into a sophisticated entrepreneurial high-tech cluster
(Avnimelech et al., 2006). As a result of this transformation, Israel became one of the most
intensive entrepreneurial high-tech clusters in the world. The number of start-ups founded
between 1991 and 2004 is 3747, compared to approximately 300 established in the entire
1980s. The number of VC funds grew from only one in 1989 to 93 active VC funds in
December 2004 (IVC, 2005).
Israel’s success in the expansion of its high-tech industry during the 1990s was directly
dependent on government ITP, directed not only at the promotion of R&D in the business
sector and high-tech industry in general, but also, more specifically, policies targeted at the
emergence of the VC industry (Yozma programme) and toward more entrepreneurial
high-tech activity (technological incubators programme). Both of these programmes
were catalytic government programmes in the sense that the government triggered the
creation of the new activity, but did not involve management, and privatized (or began
privatization of) the government’s share after a few years.
We can distinguish between two main periods in Israel’s ITP. The first phase begins
in 1969, with the establishment of the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) in the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the creation of the Industrial R&D Fund within the
OCS. This programme directly supports the R&D of individual companies whose
objective is the creation of new or improved products or processes directed at export
markets. The second phase corresponds to the 1990s, when the OCS implemented
new sets of incentive programmes (see Table 1). The VC and the incubator programmes fell under this umbrella.

VC Development in Israel and the Yozma Programme (1993 –1998)
In 1985, Atena—the first VC Company in Israel, was established. At the same time, we
observe the first wave of start-up formation in Israel. This initial round of Israeli startup and VC-related investments was the first step in the necessary adoption of the new
phase of globalization of capital and technological markets by the Israeli high-tech sector.
In the late 1980s, investors began searching for new investment opportunities in Israel.
A few VCs began operating between 1989 and 1992: Star Ventures, Veritas, and four Inbal
funds; and two Israeli investment banks established VC operations: Evergreen and Giza.
During this period significant business and government experimentation took place. These
experiments provided the new model of high-tech. The private sector identified a small set
of market-tested forms of high-tech activities, strategies and organizations, enabling the
government to better identify the type and design of the targeted VC-directed programmes,
which could be successful.
New national priorities emerged in Israel with the beginning of the massive immigration
from the former Soviet Union during the early 1990s. The Government began searching
for ways to employ the thousands of engineers who immigrated to Israel. Simultaneously,
the military industries laid-off hundreds of engineers, and many start-up companies were
founded—only to subsequently fail. Officials in the OCS realized that despite massive
government support for R&D, there were clear system failures, which blocked the successful creation and development of start-ups. This was related not only to insufficient sources
of R&D follow-up finance, but also to weak management abilities, inadequate business
know-how, and non-market-directed developments. It was clear that a gradual shift in
policy objectives had to take place—from promotion of R&D to the enhancement of
start-up formation, survival and growth. The basic problem was the lack of ability to
grow after the product development phase. The head of OCS, Yigal Erlich, believed
that the way to overcome these deficiencies was to foster a domestic professional VC
industry.
The actual trigger of the cumulative process leading to the VC emergence was the
implementation of Yozma from 1993 –1998. The explicit objective of Yozma was to
create a solid base for a competitive domestic VC industry that invested in early stage
Israeli high-tech start-ups, with the support of the government and with the involvement
of reputable foreign VCs (Figure 1). The Yozma programme created a total of 10 private

Yozma Funds.5 Each Yozma Fund had to engage a foreign financial institution together
with a well-established Israeli financial institution. In an approved fund, the government
invested $8 million of the capital raised. The programme also directly invested $20 million
through the state-owned Yozma Venture Fund. The total capital raised by Yozma Funds
was $250 million,6 and they invested in over 200 start-ups.

The Israeli Technological Incubators Programme
In Israel, the technological business incubators industry began with a deliberate government policy. Between 1991 and 1993, the OCS established 28 technological incubators
throughout the country. These incubators are managed by a professional director, a
board of directors and a project committee that selects and monitors projects. These governing institutions are composed of professionals from business, governmental and scientific communities. The government gives a start-up in an incubator an average of $425,000
over 2 years, and the start-up itself should raise an additional $75,000.7
The Israeli technological incubators support entrepreneurs at the earliest stage. The
principal purpose of the technological incubator is to help entrepreneurs successfully
implement and commercialize their products. For this purpose, the incubator provides
the following services: assistance in determining the technological and marketing applicability of the idea; assistance in obtaining the financial resources, assistance in organizing
an R&D team, managerial and marketing assistance, secretarial and administrative
services, maintenance, procurements, accounting and legal advice.
Today, there are 26 technological incubators in Israel; out of these eight are still government owned. Between 1991 and 2004, 941 projects entered the Israeli incubators, and the
graduation rate of these projects is 84%. Approximately 200 projects are still being carried
out in technological incubators today (http://www.incubators.org.il/).
Successful Exits in the Israeli High-tech Cluster of the 1990s
During the 1990s, the total number of Israeli companies undertaking IPOs increased
significantly, and the share of VC-backed issues also increased, while only small
numbers of Israeli companies were traded on US capital markets until the early 1990s.
Today over 120 Israeli companies are traded in the US (the third largest group behind
the US itself and Canada). Moreover, since 1995 a new IPO route was opened to Israeli
start-ups on European technology stock markets, and the M&A exit route—one of the
main mechanisms of exit for VCs and other investors—became significant (Avnimelech
& Teubal, 2004a). The picture that emerges is one of increasing maturity of Israel’s
high-tech cluster (see Table 2), due to cluster effects such as the creation of the VC
industry itself.
The Population and the Findings
The database includes 3747 Israeli R&D high-tech firms, which is the entire population of
R&D high-tech firms founded between 1991 and 2004. The information used in the study
for the start-ups is drawn from the IVC online database. This is a unique database
compiled by the Israel Venture Capital Research Centre, and all data have been updated
through December 2005. We adopt the definition of the IVC database. An R&D

high-tech firm is a firm that develops its own highly advanced, innovative technology or
device through investment in extensive R&D activity. The firms all began as new Israeli
start-up companies. There was no limit on their current size in terms of employees or
revenues; the only limits were that they were founded during 1991 – 2004 and can be
included in the definition of an R&D high-tech firm.
This population is divided into three subgroups: Israeli high-tech firms that received
financing from Israeli VCs (VC-backed SU)—this subgroup includes 861 start-ups
(23%); Israeli high-tech firms that graduated from a technological incubator (Incubated
SU)—this subgroup includes 618 start-ups (16.5%);8 and Israeli high-tech firms that
graduated from a technological incubator and received financing from Israeli VCs (VC þ
Incubated SU)—this subgroup includes 86 start-ups (2.3%). The remaining firms received
neither incubator financing nor Israeli VC financing. Incubators and VCs invest in different stages of the start-up development. The incubators start to invest at the pre-seed stage,
while the Israeli VCs usually make their first investment only at the early and mid stages
(in Israel 76% of VC investments are in early-mid stages and 7% in seed stage—see
Avnimelech & Teubal, 2004a). The start-ups are presented according to technological
fields (Tables 3 and 4) and to districts of creation (Tables 5 and 6).9 These inclsude one
central district (Tel Aviv and the centre districts, see Figure 2) and two other large city
districts (Haifa and Jerusalem districts), two peripheral districts (northern district which
includes northern, Golan and Haifa districts, excluding Haifa and the southern districts)

Successes and Failures
The current status of a firm can be one of the following: Exit, which means it has gone
public on a stock exchange (mostly in NASDAQ) or been acquired by another hightech company (mostly by MNE); Closure—it has gone out of business; or Survival—it
is still active, but has not accomplished an exit (see Tables 4 and 6). It is important to
note that a successful start-up will most often aspire to accomplish an exit for two main
reasons—the liquidity requirements of the external investors and the global potential
such an exit opens to the firm. Therefore, we can argue in general that the status of
these firms reflects high success (Exit), moderate success (Survival—active without
exit) and failure (Closure).
In the entire population, the failure rate is 35.6% and the success rate is 9%. VCs have
both a lower failure rate (28.3%) and a higher success rate (16.5%), while incubators have
both higher failure rate (46.4%) and a much lower success rate (3.9%). This may be
explained by the fact that incubators invest in the very early stages of development
(pre-seed and seed), while VCs invest in more mature stages (early and mid stages). Moreover, there is a selection bias in the process of approaching incubators—experienced entrepreneurs usually do not apply to incubators, and low-risk profile projects may prefer not to
use VCs and incubators.
The two most dominant sectors in Israel’s high-tech cluster (communications and software) capture 44% of the population, the Internet sector captures 9.5% of the population,
the medical devices sector captures 11.4% of the population, and all other miscellaneous
technology sectors (e.g. other life science, biotechnology, agrotech, nano-technology,
hardware, industrial technologies, energy, environment, materials, new media and many
other technological sectors) capture together 35.2%. The firms from the communication
and software sectors have, on average, higher success rates and lower failure rates—the
software sector has a lower risk profile compared to communications (both lower
failure and lower success rates). The firms from the Internet sector have on average
much higher failure rates and average success rates, while the firms in the medical

devices and other miscellaneous technology sectors have, on average, much lower success
rates and average failure rates.

The Technological Preferences of Different Investors
VC investments in Israel are more focused than the entire start-up population activity on
the communication and software sectors, which capture 58% of their investments compared to 44% in the entire start-up population. They invest a similar proportion as the

<-----Page 14----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 14:14 08 May 2015

Gil Avnimelech et al.

entire population in Internet and medical devices sectors, and in all other technological
sectors, they invest only 20% compared to 35.2% in the entire population. At the same
time, incubator investments are focused on the miscellaneous technology sectors
(63.7%—almost twice that of the entire population) and the medical devices sector
(21.7%—almost twice that of the entire population). Thus, while VCs reinforce
the narrow technological focus profile of the high-tech cluster, the incubators increase
the technological diversification of the cluster and focus on technological branches that
are less emphasized by VCs.
Table 4 presents data on success—exits and failure—closures. VCs have a relatively
high success rate in firms from the communication and software sectors (more than
20%, which is almost twice the rate in the entire population). In the medical devices
and the miscellaneous technology sectors, the VCs have a success rate, which is more
than twice that of the entire population, but is still quite low (12%). In the Internet
sector, the VCs have a success rate lower than the entire population average. The incubators have a very low success rate (3.9%). They have no exits in the Internet sector, and in
the communication and medical devices sector their success rate is about 50% lower than
the average of the entire population, in the miscellaneous technology sectors their success
rate is about 35% lower than the entire population average, and in the software sector their
success rate is about 20% lower than the average for the entire population.
The last subgroup of start-ups that graduated incubators and received VC financing is
concentrated mostly in medical devices and miscellaneous technology sectors (27.9%
and 44.2%, respectively). This group’s failure rate is the lowest (19.8%), while its
success rate is more than twice as high as the success rate of the incubated group (9.3%
compared to 3.9%) and similar to the success rate of the entire population. This subgroup’s
success rate in the medical devices and the miscellaneous technology sectors is almost
twice as high as that of the entire population, and the success rate in the software sector
is quite similar to that of the entire population.
The Regional Preferences of Different Investors
The VCs’ investments reinforce the concentration of high-tech investments (75% of VC
investments are in firms from the central district compared to 65% in the entire start-up
population and to 42% of the residents). In contrast, the incubators focus mainly on the
so-called peripheral districts (41% in the northern and the southern districts compared
to 19% in the entire population) and only 37.6% in the central district.
The success rate of the high-tech firms from the central district is much higher than the
entire population average success rate (12% compared to 9%), while it is significantly
lower in Haifa, in the southern and in the northern districts. The failure rate in the
central and the northern districts is much lower than the average, in Jerusalem and
Haifa districts the failure rate is similar to the average, and in the southern district the
failure rate is much high than the average. The very high success rate and low failure
rate in Yoqneam is a unique case driven by very successful regional policy and other
specific characteristics of this small city.10 In all districts except the south, Jerusalem
and Yoqneam, the VCs’ success rates are higher than those in the entire population,
and in all districts except the north and Yoqneam the VCs’ failure rates are lower than
those in the entire population. The incubators’ success rates in all districts except the
south and Jerusalem are significantly lower and their failure rates in all districts except

<-----Page 15----->Entrepreneurial High-tech Cluster Development

1195

Yoqneam are significantly higher in all districts. The last subgroup of start-ups that graduated incubators and received VC financing is more equally distributed (geographically)
than other VC investments. This group’s failure rate in all districts except the south and
the north are much lower than the failure rates in those districts in the entire population,
and its success rate in Jerusalem is double the average of the entire population. In the
centre and Yoqneam it is similar to the entire population.

Conclusions
The current study deals with two instruments for supporting start-up companies at the
early stages of their development—venture capital and technological incubators. It has
been argued that VC industries have a significant impact on the development and
success of their portfolio companies and on the entire entrepreneurial high-tech cluster.
At the same time, they have some drawbacks, such as enhancing the very narrow technological focus of high-tech clusters and exacerbating the tendency of high-tech activities
toward divergence between metropolitan centres and peripheral regions (Schwartz &
Bar-El, 2006). In contrast, technological business incubators are well known as quite efficient regional development mechanisms. However, their direct impact on the success of
start-up companies is quite limited. The Israeli case presented in this paper reinforced
both of these arguments.
This research suggests that the combination of both of these high-tech cluster infrastructures may have positive synergies. More specifically, while the development of a vibrant VC
industry may have a significant impact on the development and success of the entrepreneurial high-tech cluster, the technological incubators may reduce the drawbacks created by the
VC industry (particularly when there is coordination between the two mechanisms).
The Israeli case also presents anecdotal evidence that when the technological incubators
are specialized and complement the VC companies, instead of competing with them, they
can add value to the cluster and help overcome some of the VC industry drawbacks. More
specifically, specialized incubators in Israel that had strong cooperation with VCs presented improved results. These include Naiot in Yoqneam, Misgav and TEIC in the
north, which specialize in software and medical devices; JVP Studio in Jerusalem specializing in Internet and software; and Van Leer-Docor in Jerusalem that specializes in
medical devices. However, these results are only anecdotal, and their validation requires
additional research.
It is important to mention that in the Israeli case there was no formal strategy to create
strong complementarities between the VC industry and the technological business incubators. Therefore, these complementarities are created through time as a trial-and-error
process. We believe that active coordination between the VC industry and the technological incubator programme, with a deliberate strategy of using the incubators and mechanisms to reduce the drawbacks created by the VC industry, will generate much better results
for the high-tech cluster.
Since 2000, the technological incubators in Israel have begun a privatization process.
During this process, over half of the government incubators were privatized. Some of
the privatized entities included VC management companies as shareholders, and therefore
cooperation between VCs and these incubators should be improved. Additionally, these
private incubators tend to be more specialized and professional. Therefore, it would be
possible to test the hypothesis presented earlier more analytically in the future.

Notes
1. Israel’s high tech cluster could be analyzed due to its small size as a regional innovation system (Cooke,
2001).
2. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2004), between
1999 and 2002 VC investments as percentage in Israel were higher than any other OECD country,
including the US.
3. In almost all cases in Israel, successful technological start-ups will have an IPO or become a target of
significant acquisition.
4. There is a general consensus, that innovation networks are important to business success and to the economic performance of a region. Innovation networks (Cooke, 1996) provide firms with accessibility to
external resources.
5. Six Yozma Funds were created in 1993 (Gemini, Star, Concord, Pitango, Walden and Inventec); one in
1994 (JVP); two in 1995 (Medica and Eurofund); and one in 1996 (Vertex).
6. There were two Yozma Funds with $35 million and nine with $20 million (including Yozma Venture
Fund).
7. The grant to the incubator itself is $175,000 per year. Initial ownership in a tenant is as follows: at least
50% for the entrepreneur, at least 10% for other key staff members, up to 20% for the provider of supplementary financing for project implementation, and up to 20% for the incubator itself.
8. A start-up can be included in more than one of these subgroups or not included in any of the subgroups.
9. Communication, software, Internet, medical devices, other—miscellaneous technologies, all other technological fields, e.g. life science, bio, agro, nanotech, hardware, industrial, energy, environment and
others.
10. These unique regional policies should be analysed and discussed in depth in another study.
