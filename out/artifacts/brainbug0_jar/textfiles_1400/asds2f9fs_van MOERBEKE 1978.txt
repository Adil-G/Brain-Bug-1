1. Introduction
A gambler is to make one of two decisions: quitting or pursuing the game purely on
the basis of present information. Both decisions are not equally favorable, but their efficiency depends on the unknown outcome of t h e game. A reward function measures this
efficiency: the higher its value, the better the situation from t h e gambler's viewpoint.
Hence he has to decide whether the future gain will outweigh the loss due to stopping or
further unfavorable moves. We aim at studying the decision rules'or strategies yielding
the best possible average gains.
Such problems involve the time t and a position x, meaning the "state of affairs". We
deal only with the case in which X moves according to a brownian motion. This is not w
special a problem as it m a y seem; it is in fact typical and most of the problem studied
to date either exhibit a brownian behavior, genuine or transformed, or can be so approximated by a suitable scaling, provided only that the number of trials is very large.
The game is now specified by fixing the "reward function" g =g(x,: t) with the following
meaning: if the gambler decides to quit a t time t when his state of affairs is x, ~his reward
will be g(x, t). Contrariwise, if he decides to p l a y for a possibly random period of time ~,
his average reward would be

Eg (x+x~, t +~)
where xt is the brownian motion starting at Xo= O. Notice t h a t (x + %,, t § s) is the customary space-time brownian motion starting at (x, t); it is the graph of the usual brownian
motion.
Of course, it is not permitted to the gambler to foresee the future. This is built in by
allowing only "stopping times" T, b y which you will understand t h a t the event ~ < t de(!) Supported in part by National Science Foundation grant GP-36418 X.

ponds upon the brownian motion up to time t only and not upon what it does afterwards.
This paper deals only with games whose playing time is bounded above by some T <
(games with a finite horizon).
The optimal reward ~(x, t) starting at time t and with a state of affairs x is now obtained b y maximizing

Eg(x+x~,t+~)
over all stopping time ~ ~<T - t .

The optimal policy or strategy is the stopping time v

achieving this maximum. This m a x i m u m is attained for some stopping time, provided g
satisfies a growth condition, reminiscent of Tychonov's condition for the uniqueness of
the solution to the heat equation. This optimal stopping time consists of stopping as soon
as you hit the region where ~ = g . This region is called the stopping region, i.e. the region
where no policy is better than just pulling out of the game. I n its complement, the socalled continuation region (where ~ > g), it pays to go on playing the game. The boundary

x = s(t) separating these two regions is the optimal (stopping) boundary. The problem also
has a potential theoretical version and a physical interpretation in terms of Stefan's icemelting problem. Proofs and additional information can be found in P. van Moerbeke
[30]. Section 2 contains a succinct exposition of these basic facts.
The purpose of this paper is to give a description of the optimal boundary for a class
of rewards where a gambler loses one per unit time as long as he plays and is only rewarded at the horizon T with an amount h(y), if the brownian motion reaches the horizon at
y. The highest expected reward of a gambler starting at (x, t) is obtained by maximizing
- E (3; ~ < T - t) + E(h(x + xr-t); v = T - t),

over all stopping times T ~<T - t. The reward function g is somewhat disguised in this formulation, but from section 2.2 it will appear t h a t

The proof of this theorem which will be presented in section 3 goes through rather involved arguments. The main difficulty arises from a lack of monotonicity inherent to
this problem, opposed to Stefan's ice-melting problem where the water-ice interface
only moves in one d i r e c t i o n ; t h e relation of the optimization problem with a modified
Stefan problem will be explained in sections 2.5 and 4.1.
The final section will be devoted to the study of the boundary near the critical point

2. Background
2.1. The potential theory for the space-time brownian motion
This potential theory was developed b y J. L. Doob [8]. The reader will find a short
description of this theory in I t o - M c K e a n [15].
A real-valued function ] defined on R ~ is called excessive for the space-time brownian
motion in an open d o m a i n D of R ~, if
(i) ] is b o u n d e d below;
(if) E/(x +x~, t +~)</(x, t) for every stopping time ~ not exceeding the first exit time

VDfrom D.
(iii) E/(x+xrn, t + T , ) f ](x,t) for every sequence of stopping times ~,<~D such t h a t
P ( ~ ~ 0)= 1.
This definition is equivalent to another in which (ii) and (iii) are replaced b y
(if') E/(x+xs^,~, t+sA VD)</(X, t) for every s>~O.
(iii') E/(x+x,^,~, t + s h To) ~ ](x, t) when s r O.
Note t h a t (iii') is superfluous if I is continuous. I n such a case, exeessivity is a local property, indeed, a continuous function which is bounded below is excessive as soon as
E/(x+z~

, t +~n) <-</(x, t)

for all (x, t ) E D and large n, where Tn is the first exit time from the disc of radius 1/n centered at (x, t). (Blumenthal-Getoor [4], p. 93).
Consider now functions b o u n d e d from below with at least two continuous derivatives
in x and one in t. Assume

(3)

F o r a proof of this fact, see section 2.3.5 of "Stochastic

I n t e g r a l s " b y H. P. M c K e a n [19]. F o r m u l a (3) gives an alternative characterization of
excessivity for sufficiently differentiable functions: exeessivity in the domain D is the
same as H<~0 for all (x, t) in D.
A function / is called parabolic in a domain D c R ~ if
(i) ] is excessive in D,
(if) EI(x +x~ o, t +vv) =l(x, t),

<-----Page 4----->AN

where vv is the first exit time from any open set U with compact closure in D. Parabolic
functions arc C ~176
and enjoy the property

St+ 1 S~I
Conversely any function bounded from below satisfying this equation is automatically
parabolic in view of (3).
Finally a boundary point (x, t) will be called regular for an open region D if

P(x+x~, t + s E D , s ~ O) =0.

2.2. Definition and further characterizations of the optimal reward
Throughout section 2, definition and lemmas will be stated for more general rewards
than is actually needed in Theorem 1. Assume t h a t the reward g is bounded below, is
C ~ in t < T and has limits g(x, T - )

for t f T; a discontinuity at t = T is permitted, but

g(x, T) itself is to be continuous. The notation
h(x) = g(z, T ) - g ( z , T - )
is often employed and h will be called t h e / i n a l gain. You m a y assume h(x) >~0; the motivation is that, if h(x) < 0 in an interval, it is more favorable to stop the game a little before
hitting the final horizon t = T.
Henceforth we impose upon g a growth condition, called the Tychonov condition. This
condition will be useful in matters like the continuity of ~, the existence of an optimal
strategy, etc., ... If the functions
Sg Sg S~g S2g Sag
g' St' dx' Sx ~' SxSt' Sx a
and

are bounded b y e~

h, Sh S2h and sahSx' Sx 2
Sx a
when JxJ tends to ~ uniformly in a n y strip of finite depth [t, T],

then g is said to satisfy the Tychonov condition.
The optimal reward is the supremum
sup Eg(z + x~, t + T) = O(x, t)
over all stopping times ~ < T - t. The stopping regions S is defined as the set of points where
quitting is best, i.e. where ~ =g. Its complement C is called the continuation region; this is

<-----Page 5----->116

PIERRE VAN MOERBEKE

where it pays to play the game, i.e., where ~ > 9. The optimal boundary separates the two
regions.
As already observed by J. L. Snell [25] in the context of martingales, d can be regarded as the smallest excessive function exceeding g and the backwards induction used
by several authors in the discrete case is adapted to the present case in the form
~(z, t) = sup g,,(x, t)

where go=g and

g,~(x, t) =

same as maximizing

Eg(x+x~, t +~)
over all stopping times ~ < T - t, where g is given b y (2). Also as a consequence of (4) one
never stops at a point where H > 0, as proceeding a little while will improve one's gain.

2.3. Analytical characterizations of the op~'hnal reward
We state here a few lemmas without proof, to be used in the sequel:
LEMMA 1: (E. B. Dynkin [9]) ~ is continuous throughout and is parabolic in the con-

tinuation region, i.e.
(~+1~)~=0~

in C.

LEMMA 2: (H. M. Taylor [28]). Stopping at ~ =g is the best policy.

with continuous H in a region C with zero boundary data. Whenever its boundary is Lipschitz continuous, the derivative (Ou/~x) is continuous up to the boundary and its limit equals
its value at the boundary.
The next lemma will play an important role in the proof of Theorem 1.
LEMMA 5: Let the optimal boundary x = s( t ) be continuously di]]erentiable ( l ~ l < ~ ) in

an interval (to, tl); then in this interval,
(a) (O/Ox) (~-g) and (~/Ot) (~-g) both are continuous across and they vanish at the bound-

ary.
(b) 1(0~/0x2) (~ - g ) i8 continuous in C up to the boundary and equals - H at the boundary.
(c) (02/~xOt)(~-g) is continuous in C up to the boundary and equals 2H(s(t), t) g(t) at the

boundary.
(d) (02/Ot~)(~-g) (s(t), t) exists and equals -2H(s(t), t)$2(t) at a boundary point where
~>0.

Proo/. Thanks to Lemma 1, ~ - g is continuous everywhere and satisfies
0

1 0~
+ ~ ~x~) ( ~ - g) = - H in C with ( ~ - g) (s(t), t) = 0.

(5)

By assumption, s(t) is differentiable between to and t 1. Therefore, using Lemma 4,

(O/Ox)(~-g) exists and is continuous up to the boundary and according to Lemma 3,
O(~-9)(s(t),t)=O
Ox

which is half of (a). Now (O/Ox) ( ~ - g) is continuous in (to, tl) and satisfies
(0+1

~z) 0 ~

and, at the boundary

OH

~x ( ~ - g) (s(t), t) = O.

According to Lemma 4 again, (~2/Ox~)(~-g) exists everywhere and is continuous up to the
boundary. Since ~ satisfies the backward heat equation this automatically implies that

(O/~t)(~-g) exists and is continuous up to t h e boundary. Differentiating (~-g)(s(t), t)
with respect to t and taking into account (6) yields
~ t ( ~ - g) (s(t), t) = 0
which is the other half of (a).

Again Lemma 4 applied to u leads to the continuity of ( ~ ] a x b t ) ( ~ - g ) up to the boundary.
Its value at the boundary is given by differentiating ( a / a x ) ( ~ - g ) (s(t), t) with respect to t:
82

~(t) ~

( ~ - g) (s(t), t) + ~

82

( ~ - g) (s(t), t) = o

which combined with (8) completes the proof of point (e).
Finally, as to (d), if g >0, then
a
fit (~- g) (s(t), t) = o
implies

The boundary conditions (10) and (11) are called the "smooth fit" relations. The

The converse of proposition 1 is also true; more precisely
PROPOSITION 2. Let u be a Tychonov.type /unction defined in t <~T. Let C be an open

For conversation's sake, let the continuation region be bounded on either side b y two
curves x = si(t), i = 1, 2, with $~(t) continuous, bounded and s 1 <s~. Also ~ is assumed to have

(18)

This free boundary problem is at least formally Stefan's ice melting problem: w
satisfies the heat equation with a possible heat in- or output, the temperature at the interface vanishes and the heat flux is proportional to the rate of melting (because H <0), with
a variable heat-capacity; (89

2.6. A local theorem
The optimal b o u n d a r y is continuously differentiable for a little while starting from the
horizon. Such is the object of Proposition 3. This statement plays an essential role in
Theorem 1. Its proof can be found in P. v a n Moerbeke [30].

Outline of the proof: from Proposition 3 we know that, starting from the finite horizon, g does not blow up for a little while. Extend the boundary down to a point t o where
ceases to exist. If S(to)=0, you would have reached the bottom of C [see Fig. 1] and since
h is even, the proof would be finished. Therefore the main point is to prove that, if s(to) > 0,
then s(t) can be extended a bit below to in a continuously differentiable way. An argument
involving Proposition 3 shows that this is so as soon as ]g] is bounded in (t0, T].
Therefore all the effort of Theorem 1 is put into proving that ]~ ] is bounded in (t0, T].
The proof of the latter is achieved through a sequence of lemmas, from 6 to 14. The reader
familiar with Kae's [16] "principle of not feeling the curvature" knows that a brownian
observer close enough to the boundary will feel it only as a straight line, to a first approximation. This idea is now adapted to the space-time brownian motion so that the boundary
can actually be replaced by a tangent line near the point under consideration. The estimates are then performed in this simplified region.

Remark: Theorem 1 proves the smoothness of the boundary in the half open interval
(too, T]; it remains an open question to establish smoothness of s(t) as a curve at the critical point. I n section 4.2 we discuss the shape of the boundary near too.
Theorem 1 refers to a linear reward in t < T, which is the easiest situation to handle.
For general g, one expects a statement of the following nature: the boundary is differentiable except at a finite number of critical points, provided some conditions are imposed
upon the level lines of H, as will transpire from Lemma 9. The present theorem can be
generalized to the case where g is merely concave in x, below t = T, with a considerable
loss of simplicity. Further extensions get more and more delicate and the answers are unsatisfactory.
The lateral conditions for h at the points • a are essential to give the boundary a
nice start at t = T. If (~/~x)h(+a)=0, but if 89

would be different from 1, the

boundary would get off the horizon approximately as a parabola x = ~ V T - t , whose opening ~ can be computed using the methods of [29] or [30]. If, however, (~/Ox)h(+a)<0
and (9/~z)h(-a) > 0, then the boundary m a y behave in a much more singular way.

L E ~ M A 6. Assume the condition8 o/ Theorem 1. Let the boundary x = • s(t) o / t h e continuation region be continuously di//erentiable in (to, T] and Tick a Toint x = s(t) on the boundary with

to <

t < T chosen so that $(t) > O. Then the/ollowing expansion is valid

(~- g) (x, t + 8) =-~ ~ ( g - g) (x, t) + o (~=).
Proo/. If a function /(t) is continuously differentiable on the real line and if the
second derivative exists at a point t, then we have the following Taylor expansion:

ing of to, a piece of the arc ,,4~ would lie above an interval of the line t =to; see figure 3. But,
because of the m a x i m u m principle, u = e along this interval. This contradicts the fact t h a t

u(x, t), a solution of the heat equation, is analytic in x. Hence any horizontal line t = t o
cuts A~ in exactly one point. Therefore A~ and ~4_~, can be represented by two continuous
curves ~+(t):and e~.(t); they constitute part of the boundary of {u>e} and { u < - e ' } .
Moreover, it is always possible to pick
e,+,(t) >Q~(t)

for all t,

whenever el>ez. With this choice, ~o,+(t) decreases to Qff(t) which is upper semi-continuous
as a decreasing limit of continuous functions, while p~,(t) increases to a lower semi-continuous function Qff(t), and

Q~(t)/> eo (t).
Assume t h a t

~)g(t) > ~ (t),

i.e., pick x such that o~(t)>x >Q~(t). I n Figure 2, the heat is flowing downwards, i.e., in
the t-direction, while the corresponding brownian motion is running upwards. If ~ is the
first hitting time of ~, or ~: or t =0, then, since u is parabolic,

Eu(x + x~, t +~) =u(x, t)
which can be made arbitrarily small, b y choosing ~ and e' small. Because, for all e and e'
e;, (t) < eo (t) < e~ (t) < e,+ (t),

u must vanish everywhere between p~(t) and ~(t), which is absurd in view of u's analyticity. Hence ~ff(t)=~d-(t) and its eommon value ~0(t) is a continuous curve. Because of the
m a x i m u m principle again you deduce that u does not vanish either in ( - b , Q0(t)) nor in

(po(t), b), which implies t h a t ~0(t) is the only place where u vanishes. For a different proof
of this theorem originally conjectured by Sturm [27], see P61ya [21](1).

I t is to be proved that the two root curves +r(t) of 89

r(t) meet the b o u n d a r y - - s a y - - a t time tl>~to. Then on the one hand, since the interval
(r(t), s(t)) becomes smaller and smaller when t decreases to tl, the total amount of (positive)
heat contained therein would decrease to zero, by the maximum principle. By symmetry,
the same is true for the interval (-s(t),-r(t)). But on the other hand 89

would

remain negative in the interval ( - r ( t ) , r(t)). Hence the net amount of "heat" in the interval (-s(t), s(t)) would become negative, when t approaches tl; this violates the conservation law (21). ~qow r(t) cannot intersect s(t) in the time interval [to, T] and consequently

1. According to Proposition :3, the b o u n d a r y is continuously dif-

ferentiable in a time interval (t0, T]. Choose t o as low as possible, so t h a t $ ceases to exist
there. Can the b o u n d a r y be extended below t o under the assumption t h a t the two boundaries have n o t y e t intersected? The main point is to establish t h a t ~(t) is bounded in (to, T];
this is the content of (a), (b), (e), (d), and (e) below. The remaining task is to prove t h a t
s(t) can be extended in a smooth w a y a bit below

to; this

contradicts t0's choice as the point

where ~ ceases to exist.

So far we have proven that d is bounded in the interval (to, T]. The final job is to

implies t h a t (~3/~xa)~ is bounded throughout Che continuation region between t o and T.
But now Proposition 3 applies to

Both relations follow from the smooth fit conditions, and (50) would still be valid even if
they were not true; then the initial temperature would contain ~-functions but would still
satisfy (50). Relation (49) follows merely from (50) and the heat conservation law.
That for optimal stopping problems with a compact final gain the total amount of
heat equals the total amount of heat required to freeze the water is an important fact: it
is responsible for the compactness of the continuation region and for the fact t h a t the continuation region closes down at the bottom. I t is instructive to see what occurs when the
total amount of heat does not equal the total amount of heat necessary to freeze the water.
This question was raised by B. W. Knight.(1)
(a) First assume t h a t the total amount of heat would exceed the amount necessary to
freeze the liquid:
,(r) O~h
s(r) ~-~ < 0,
i.e., the liquid would not be sufficiently supercooled to become completely solid (el. figure
11). Then there always would be a residual amount of unfrozen water, and it is intuitively

<-----Page 30----->141

AN OPTIMAL STOPPING PROBLEM WITH LINEAR REWARD

obvious t h a t this residual amount equals the excess amount of heat which would have to
be extracted from the system to achieve complete freezing. I n view of L e m m a 9, this case
corresponds to the situation where the root curves of

(~Z/~x~)~ meet

each other before

meeting the boundary. Then, the boundary can be extended indefinitely, as a result of a
small modification of Theorem 1.
(b) Next suppose t h a t the total initial amount of heat would be less than the amount
necessary to freeze the liquid:
f ] ~ ~Zh
~x--~ < 0,
i.e., the liquid would be too cold (cf. figure 12). Then one expects a swift freezing of the
water and the smaller the distance between both pieces of ice, the smaller the temperature
gets in view of the fact t h a t an inescapable amount of cold (negative heat) will remain.
But the m a x i m u m principle does not allow the water to decrease its temperature below
the minimum of the initial temperature. I n a n y case as long as the root curves of

(OZ/Ox2)~

do not intersect the boundary, the arguments of Theorem 1 show t h a t the boundary can
be extended downwards in a smooth way. At the very m o m e n t the root curves of

(OZ/Ox~)

meet the boundary, the solution ceases to exist, because the boundary condition

cannot be satisfied anymore; one m a y think of this as a sudden and instantaneous freezing of all the water.
These two arguments have shown t h a t if the ice-melting picture is to come from an
optimal stopping problem, you must actually have (50).

4.2. The shape of the boundary near critical points

Here the r e w a r d function g is as in Theorem 1 and

h(x) even. P u t the origin of the

(x, t)-axes at the lowest point, i.e., the critical point. I t will be shown heuristically t h a t the
boundary either exhibits a cusp at the critical point, or behaves flatter than e~/t and not
flatter than (1 + e) 1/2 t log log (1/t) for a n y e > 0. I t remains an open question whether both
can exist or only the latter.
The continuation region is a bounded open set with continuously differentiable boundary x =

is(t) for t >0, given b y the solution to the equation (17):

s(t) must be non-decreasing in the neighborhood of the

so as to make the boundary monotone for 0 ~<t~< T, as in Figure, I3. Now we have two

Case (1) implies t h a t

s(t) is Lipschitz continuous in the closed interval [0, T]; hence the

integrals on the right-hand side of (51) would have limits when t tends to zero, Therefore
lim~ 0 d(t) would:eXist and would be finite. When t 4 0, the sum of the two:first integrals
on the right-hand side of (51) would cancel each other and the last integral would vanish
because (~a/axa)h is an odd function. Hence ~(0 + ) = 0 and the continuation region would
be cusp shaped down at the bottom. This fact is rigorous; the rest will be heuristic.

I n case (2), we merely proceed by exclusion, b y limiting the discussion to curves such
t h a t s(t) is a power' or a power times a slowly varying function.(1) We show that:
(a) The critical point is regular for the continuation region, under the assumption t h a t

s(t)/Vt is monotone near t =0. Indeed, since $ >~0, (51) yields the inequality

If the critical point would be irregular (cf. section 2.1)and since t-1/2s(t) is decreasing,

gets below 1 when t converges to zero. Hence it wouId follow from (52) t h a t ~ is bounded;
this contradicts the assumption t h a t the critical point is irregular.
(b) s(t) cannot behave like,g, 1 > e > 1/2 near t =0. Indeed, a standard integration b y

If s(t) would behave as announced under (b), the integral between the brackets in (54)
would be bounded and could be made smaller than 1; hence d(t) would be bounded, which
is absurd. By comparison, also t~to(t), 1 > e > 1/2, with a slowly varying function to(t), can
be excluded.

(c) s(t) cannot behave like t ll~ for t 4 0. We recaU t h a t v = ~(~-g)/St satisfies (13), (14),

Because of this inequality and the fact that the left side blows up to infinity, as t r 0, v(0, v)
cannot tend to 0. Since the critical point is regular, any Diriehlet solution, e.g., v(x, ~),
assumes its proper boundary value, whence we have a contradiction and s(t) ~- ~Vt cannot
be a valid assumption.
(d) s(t) cannot behave like Vto~(t), where ~o(t) is a slowly varying function, converging
to zero with t.
The probability of not hitting a parabola x = _ al'~ before time T behaves like tB(~),
where -2fl(~) is the largest pole of the function
D_~ (0) + Da(0)
D-a (~) + Da (~)'
Da and D-a denote the parabolic cylinder functions. You find that
0</3(~)<~,

limfl(~)=0,
~t~

limfl(~)=~o,
~o

andfl(1)=l.

This follows easily from a result by L. Breiman [5].
Assume s(t) would behave like ~w(t). By comparison, u(0, t), alias the probability of
not hitting the parabola before time T, must behave at least like tr(t) where 7(t) tends to
infinity for t 4 0. The most important contribution of the integrand on the left-hand side
of (56) is of order eo~(v)/Ta12 for small v, while on the right-hand side it is of order Tv[t)/~ 31~.
This implies that the inequality in (56) cannot hold under this assumption, whence the
result under (d).
The upshot of the results in (a), (b), (c), and (d) is to substantiate (though not really
to prove) the assertion under section 4.2.
