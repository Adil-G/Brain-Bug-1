Abstract
Purpose – Extant theories suggest that entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics have substantial
impacts on their firm’s performance. From a resource-based view, the paper considers an
entrepreneur’s personal characteristics to be a unique resource endowment to their firm. The paper
seeks to discuss these issues.
Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through a national survey of owners and
senior managers of small- to medium-sized Canadian manufacturing companies. Mediation
relationships were tested with hierarchical regression analyses.
Findings – Consistent with the authors’ hypotheses, it is found that entrepreneurs’ personal
characteristics, such as need for achievement, need for cognition, and internal locus of control, have
positive influences on firm performance. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that their strategic orientations
mediated these influences. The data indicate that entrepreneurs with higher levels of internal locus of
control are more likely to adopt an entrepreneurial orientation than a market orientation.
Originality/value – This paper helps to better understand why entrepreneurs make different
strategic decisions under seemingly similar competitive environments. The findings suggest that
entrepreneurs do not simply react mechanically to external environmental changes. Instead, how they
seek and interpret information and formulate organizational strategies is partially influenced by their
personal characteristics. Entrepreneurs develop their own ways of utilizing the human capital that
they bring to their firms.

The success of small businesses heavily depends on the human capital of their
owner-managers (Jones et al., 2007). When an entrepreneur starts a business, they
bring a unique set of human capital to their business as a part of resource endowment
to the firm, including, but not limited to, their skills, experience, and personality. As
such, the business becomes an extension of the entrepreneur as an individual
(Hambrick and Mason, 1984).
The resource-based view of the firm (RBV) posits that each organization is endowed
with a finite amount of resources. Some of these resources are rare, valuable, and
difficult for competitors to copy, and therefore provide the firm with opportunities to
gain sustainable competitive advantages (Peteraf, 1993; Barney, 1991; Hunt and

<-----Page 1----->Morgan, 1995; Penrose, 1959). Penrose (1959) maintains that human capital, such as the
entrepreneur’s skills, experience, and other personal characteristics, are key resource
endowments. This paper investigates how entrepreneurs utilize their skills and
experiences to influence their firm’s performance. More specifically, we will
demonstrate that the entrepreneur’s personal characteristics influence their strategic
choices, which in turn influence the firm’s performance.
Many researchers have investigated entrepreneurial characteristics by applying
Hambrick and Mason’s (1984) upper echelon theory, which regards a firm as a
reflection and extension of its owner. Research has revealed, for example, the firm’s
strategic choices, behaviors, and performances are to a large extent influenced by the
demographic characteristics of its owners or top managers (Smith et al., 1996), their
social connections (Geletkanycz and Hambrick, 1997), their perceptions of the
environment (Kiesler and Sproull, 1982), and their decision-making styles (Eisenhardt,
1999). Essentially, the upper echelon theory, a special case of RBV, enriches the
strategy formulation and resource allocation processes described by Child and Francis
(1977) by considering the influence of entrepreneurial characteristics. Recent empirical
evidence supports the view that entrepreneurs’ and top managers’ personal
characteristics have a substantial direct impact on firm performance (Switzer and
Huang, 2007; Adams et al., 2005), and an indirect impact on performance, mediated by
decision-making speed, decision type, and strategy formulation (Karami et al., 2006).
Seymour (2006) critiques classic approaches in business research, arguing that
making direct links between factors such as resources and performance, or
environment and strategy, is overly objective and lacks subjectivity. Ketchen et al.
(2007) argue that resource endowment alone may not automatically lead to superior
firm performance. Instead, they propose that entrepreneurs and managers must deploy
resources wisely to maximize potential benefits. In other words, they argue that the
resource-performance link is mediated by a firm’s strategic choices. Macpherson and
Holt (2007) further highlight the complexity of interactions among human capital,
organizational systems, and firm growth.
Commenting on knowledge utilization in organizations, Tsoukas (2002, p. 420)
draws our attention to “developing a distinctive way of utilizing resources” and the
“inherently creative potential of human action”. Evidence suggests that even under
seemingly similar external environmental conditions, some firms might opt to place
greater emphasis on understanding the market, while others might focus on innovation
(Atuahene-Gima and Ko, 2001). Grinstein (2008) argues that research should shift away
from assessing the efficacy of a singular strategy to examining strategic options and
potentially combination strategies. In this paper, we examine how entrepreneurs
consider both market and entrepreneurial orientations when developing strategic
decisions.
According to Ketchen et al.’s (2007) propositions, the RBV should be extended to
include strategic choices that mediate the relationship between resource endowment and
firm performance. Macpherson and Holt (2007) clearly favor holistic studies, as well. For
practical purposes, we have limited the scope of our study to include a small number of
variables in each category of constructs. Considered as human capital resource
endowment, we investigate a sample of personal characteristics: internal locus of control,
need for cognition, and need for achievement. Considered as organizational strategic
choices, we examine whether the organization is more market-oriented or

entrepreneurial-oriented. For firm performance, we consider a multitude of finance-based
indicators including revenue, return on investment, and return on assets. In the course of
this paper, we review and summarize the literature on market orientation,
entrepreneurial orientation, and various relevant personal characteristics. We then
hypothesize their relationships and describe our empirical study designed to test these
relationships. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings.

1. Literature review
Considerable effort has been invested in identifying the set of desirable personal
characteristics for starting or effectively managing businesses. For example,
researchers have identified that achievement motivation positively affects an
entrepreneur’s speed of decision-making (Kauer et al., 2007), risk-taking attitudes
influence an entrepreneur’s strategic decisions whether to form alliances with other
businesses (Pansiri, 2007), professional experience and education are likely to lead and
enable an entrepreneur to develop formal strategic plans (Karami et al., 2006), and
intuition leads an entrepreneur to prefer a prospector strategy (Gallen, 2006).
Although researchers have uncovered a host of personal characteristics that are
critical antecedents to firm performance, as Dobbs and Hamilton (2007) observe,
knowledge about the relationship among the characteristics of entrepreneurs, their
strategic decisions, and the performance of their firms is still fragmented, and that no
research to date has produced a coherent theory. The following discussion elucidates
these prior findings and attempts to join them together.
1.1 Market orientation
Market orientation (MO) is the organization-wide concerted effort in generating market
intelligence pertaining to current and future customer needs, disseminating intelligence
across departments, and responding to such intelligence (Kohli and Jaworski, 1990).
Market-oriented firms embrace a collection of special behaviors that place primary
emphasis on customers. It has also been argued that an organization’s ability to respond
to the market depends on the extent of its knowledge of both customers and competitors
(Narver and Slater, 1990). That is, a market-oriented firm must have an organizational
culture that encourages and facilitates all activities involved in both acquiring
information about customers and competitors in the target market and disseminating the
information throughout the business. Hence, MO is a composite construct that
encompasses three distinct components: customer orientation, competitor orientation,
and inter-functional coordination. Both Narver and Slater’s (1990) and Kohli and
Jaworski’s (1990) conceptualizations of market orientation have been extensively
employed in the stream of research that followed their work. Empirical findings from
both perspectives generally converge to support the conclusion that MO has a robust
positive influence on firm performance (Kirca et al., 2005; Cano et al., 2004).
Notwithstanding the solid impact of MO on performance, other strategic options are
available for managers to consider. For example, Sin et al. (2002) have shown that
relationship marketing orientation (RMO), which focuses on cultivating a mutually
beneficial long-term relationship between buyers and sellers, also has positive effects
on firm performance. These researchers have also demonstrated that, depending on
industry and economic ideology, RMO may be more effective than MO in some cases
(Sin et al., 2005).

<-----Page 3----->A notable shortcoming of MO is its reliance on entities external to the firm (e.g.,
customers and competitors) to guide its actions. Jaworski et al. (2000) have warned that
firms should avoid being market-driven and, instead, should attempt to drive the
market. In order to achieve such goals, some have identified innovation, proactivity,
and risk-taking as complementary elements to MO. For example, Atuahene-Gima and
Ko (2001) demonstrate that entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is an alternative to MO.
When a firm aligns both MO and EO it would have superior performance in the
commercialization of new products. Zhou et al. (2005) also consider EO as an
alternative strategic orientation to MO.
1.2 Entrepreneurial orientation
EO relates to the processes, practices, and decision-making activities that lead to a new
entry (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996). EO involves not only the intentions but also the
actions of key players in a dynamic generative process aimed at new venture creation.
The fundamental dimensions that characterize EO, Lumpkin and Dess assert, include a
propensity to act autonomously, a willingness to innovate and take risks, a tendency to
be aggressive toward competitors, and proactively pursuing market opportunities.
Covin and Slevin (1991) maintain that, in addition to influencing new venture creation,
EO also influences a firm’s on-going performance. Therefore, EO is an important
strategic orientation for existing firms as well. Empirical evidence suggests that firms
with a high level of EO are much more likely to engage in innovation (Manimala, 1992)
and enjoy better overall organizational performance (Smart and Conant, 1994). The
positive influence of EO on performance is extensive, and the strength of this influence
increases over time. Therefore, researchers argue that investment in EO is financially
worthwhile as it will pay off over an extended period of time (Wiklund, 1999).
Atuahene-Gima and Ko (2001) demonstrate that firms adopt various combinations of
strategic orientation. Some place their emphasis more heavily on either MO or EO. Those
that integrate both MO and EO, however, achieve the strongest performances in the
commercialization of innovation. Zhang et al. (2007) further demonstrate that, while both
MO and EO have unique and significant positive influences on firm performance, these
two strategic orientations influence performance via different paths.
Entrepreneurial-oriented firms are more likely to concentrate on direct links to financial
performance, whereas market-oriented firms are more likely to focus on customers and
gaining long-term financial return through improved satisfaction and loyalty.
Environmental factors have typically been conceptualized as moderators for both
MO (Kohli and Jaworski, 1990) and EO (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996). Only a few studies
have examined the factors that lead managers to choose either strategic orientation.
Zhang et al. (2007) suggest that certain market environmental factors, such as
munificence, competitive intensity, and market turbulence, might affect managers’
selection of strategic orientations. Kohli and Jaworski (1990) have stipulated that the
top manager’s emphasis is an important antecedent to MO. We suspect that it could
also be the case in EO. In the following subsection, we seek to identify what type of
entrepreneurs is more likely to adopt MO or EO.
1.3 Managerial characteristics in management literature
There is a rich body of management literature that seeks to identify certain sets of
desirable personal characteristics for entrepreneurs starting new businesses and for

managers running companies effectively. A large number of managerial
characteristics have been examined in the management literature. For example,
prior research has shown that managers with higher levels of achievement motivation
make decisions faster (Kauer et al., 2007), owner-manager’s personal visions correlate
with above average annual sales levels (Mazzarol et al., 2009), managers with higher
levels of education are more likely to develop formal strategic plans (Karami et al.,
2006), managerial cognition plays a vital role in managerial conduct and performance
(Panagiotou, 2006), and managers with an internal locus of control tend to be more
innovative (Miller and Toulouse, 1986) and effective (Govindarajan, 1989). Prior
research has considered achievement motivation and internal locus of control as
critical characteristics of successful entrepreneurs (Littenen, 2000; Hansemark, 1998).
However, extant knowledge on this topic is fragmented (Dobbs and Hamilton, 2007).
More research is needed to provide a holistic picture of entrepreneurial behaviors
(Macpherson and Holt, 2007).
In our study, we take a resource-based view and consider the entrepreneur’s
personal characteristics as human capital resource endowments, and examine them in
the context of strategy and performance. In terms of variables, we examine three
frequently investigated personal characteristics in the entrepreneurship research: need
for achievement, need for cognition, and internal locus of control.
Need for achievement. The need for achievement (NFA) construct has a long history
in psychology. It generally refers to a stable, learned characteristic in which
satisfaction is obtained by striving for and attaining higher levels of excellence
(Feldman, 1999). Although NFA was originally conceptualized as a stable personal
trait, more recent studies have demonstrated that it can evolve over time, particularly
through the acquisition of advanced education, such as an MBA programme. One
study found that students substantially increased their achievement needs after
enrolling in an MBA programme (Hansemark, 1998). Prior research also indicates that
there is a positive relationship between NFA and entrepreneurship ( Johnson, 1990).
Research also suggests that angel investors typically have a higher NFA (Duxbury
et al., 1996); entrepreneurs with a higher NFA are more likely to be successful ( Johnson
and Ma, 1995). In some cases, NFA is one of the selection criteria for entering
entrepreneurship training programmes (Gupta, 1989). There seems to be a consensus
on the positive relationship between managerial NFA and successful performance.
Several studies have examined NFA’s influence on firm strategies. For example, it
was found that a CEO’s NFA affects the rationality of the strategic decision-making
processes by increasing organizational formalization and integration (Miller et al.,
1988). When a CEO has a high level of NFA, they are more likely to adopt broadly
focused strategies and be proactive (Miller and Toulouse, 1986). Being proactive is one
of the key elements of entrepreneurial orientation (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996). Therefore,
we suspect that entrepreneurs with higher levels of NFA are likely to adopt
entrepreneurial-oriented strategies.
Lumpkin and Dess (1996) have also theorized a positive relationship between NFA
and EO. They predict that entrepreneurs and managers with higher levels of NFA are
more likely to adopt EO, which in turn contributes to superior firm performance. The
literature, however, is relatively silent on the relationship between NFA and MO. In
summary, extant literature supports the idea that entrepreneurs with higher levels of
NFA are more likely to cultivate an organizational culture that is more competitive and

<-----Page 5----->proactive. We hypothesize that an entrepreneur’s NFA has a significant direct impact
on the firm’s strategy and an indirect on performance:

H1. An entrepreneur with a higher level of NFA is likely to adopt entrepreneurial
orientation to achieve superior firm performance.
Internal locus of control. According to Rotter (1966), internal locus of control (ILOC)
versus external locus of control conceptualizes how individuals see their own actions
affecting events that surround their lives. Individuals with ILOC tend to believe that
events are the results of their own actions (Rotter, 1966), while individuals with
external locus of control tend to attribute events to external environmental factors,
such as powerful others or chance (Levenson, 1973).
If we put the concept of ILOC in the context of an entrepreneur running their
business in a competitive environment, we can imagine that an entrepreneur with a
strong ILOC would believe that they can make things happen, and that the success or
failure of their business is the result of their own actions. In contrast, an entrepreneur
with an external locus of control might consider that the external environment is the
main reason for their business success or failure.
Market-oriented organizational culture requires that a firm be attuned to its
customers, and design and deliver products and services that fulfill customer needs
and wants. In other words, a market orientation assumes the customers as the locus of
control. An entrepreneur with a high level of ILOC may not be willing to surrender the
control of their organizations and seek directions from customers, competitors, or other
external entities. They would rather take matters into their own hands and formulate a
competitive organizational culture that is internally driven by their own innovative
and creative ideas.
ILOC is a signature characteristic of angel investors and entrepreneurs (Johnson
and Ma, 1995). Entrepreneurs with high levels of ILOC tend to perceive themselves as
having more managerial discretion and power (Carpenter and Golden, 1997). Managers
and entrepreneurs with ILOC also tend to be more innovative (Miller and Toulouse,
1986) and effective (Govindarajan, 1989). Prior research have also indicated that the
positive impact of ILOC on firm performance is mediated by the entrepreneur’s
risk-taking behaviors (Boone et al., 1996). The extant literature clearly indicates a
positive relationship between ILOC and entrepreneurial behaviors. Consistent with
prior findings, we hypothesize that an entrepreneur’s ILOC has direct and indirect
positive impacts on the firm’s performance, and the entrepreneur with a high level of
ILOC is more likely to adopt EO:
H2. An entrepreneur with a high level of ILOC is likely to adopt entrepreneurial
orientation to achieve superior firm performance.
Need for cognition. A need for cognition (NFC) is a tendency to engage in and enjoy
thinking (Cacioppo and Petty, 1982). The psychology literature suggests that
individuals naturally differ in their levels of NFC (Cacioppo et al., 1996). Those with
higher levels of NFC possess positive attitudes toward complex stimuli that require
thinking (Cacioppo et al., 1986). Individuals with higher levels of NFC also favor
extensive information searches, whereas those with lower levels of NFC prefer
interpersonal sources of information and are more likely to act upon perceptions and
gut feelings (Mourali et al., 2005).

87

<-----Page 6----->IJEBR
17,1

88

Although the NFC construct was originally developed in psychology, it has been
widely applied in the marketing field, particularly in consumer behavior and
advertising research. For example, in the context of assessing the effects of reference
group opinions, it has been found that individuals with high levels of NFC place
greater emphasis on the logical evaluation of topic-relevant arguments, while
individuals with low levels of NFC make their decisions based on affective attitudes
toward the information (Areni et al., 2000). Campbell and Kirmani (2000) have found
that consumers with higher levels of NFC and cognitive capacity are more capable of
activating their knowledge base. Those with higher levels of formal education are
thought to have more cognitive capacity and higher NFC, and are more likely to engage
in rational reasoning (Cacioppo et al., 1986). In an advertising context, researchers have
found that individuals with higher levels of NFC are more capable of understanding
complex advertisements (Putrevu et al., 2004).
While NFC has not been extensively examined in the domains of strategic
management and entrepreneurship, evidence shows that managers and entrepreneurs
with higher NFC are more successful at adaptive decision-making (Levin et al., 2000). If
individuals with higher levels of NFC behave in certain patterns, it would be
reasonable to deduce that entrepreneurs with higher levels of NFC would behave
similarly. We would expect that an entrepreneur with a higher level of NFC would
place greater emphasis on logical arguments and make their strategic decisions based
on extensive market research rather than on intuition. MO encourages the entrepreneur
to generate extensive market intelligence. The market intelligence can be complex, and
it requires a high level of cognitive capacity to effectively analyze and respond. We
hypothesize, therefore, that an entrepreneur’s NFC has a significant impact on a firm’s
strategy and performance, and the entrepreneur with a high level of NFC is likely to be
market-oriented:
H3. An entrepreneur with a higher level of NFC is likely to adopt market
orientation to achieve superior firm performance.
Essentially, we propose a contextual model based on the extended resource-based view
(Ketchen et al., 2007). We believe an entrepreneur’s personal characteristics will
influence their strategic orientations, which ultimately leads to business performance
(see Figure 1).
2. Research methods
2.1 Procedure
We have hypothesized several relationships among entrepreneurs’ personal
characteristics, their firm’s strategic orientations, and performances. A
cross-sectional survey-based method is suitable for testing the study hypotheses
because data on a large number of organizations can be collected systematically via
this method (Babbie, 1973). The survey method is the least susceptible to researcher
bias in data collection, analysis, and interpretation (Busha and Harter, 1980).
A mail survey was administered to small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in
Canadian manufacturing industry. A sample of 2,200 companies was selected from
approximately 100,000 Canadian companies listed in Profile Canada’s database. This
selection was a compromise between a wide cross-industry sample and a focused
sample. The companies in our sample are all in the manufacturing industry but they

Hypothesized model

produce a wide variety of products, including processed food, clothing, furniture, and
industrial equipments. A cross-industry sampling approach would allow broader
generalization but errors may occur because each industry has its unique competitive
environment. A focused sample would limit the influence of industry factors but limit the
generalizability of the findings. We have chosen to sample the highly populated and
relatively diverse manufacturing industry in order to allow our results to be generalized
to a larger population, yet at the same time keep the environmental factors relatively
comparable. Our sample does not include, for example, companies in financial services or
oil and gas sectors where competitive behaviors are considerably different because of
oligopoly and government regulations. The manufacturing industry has been a favorite
sample frame for many prior studies of a similar nature (Pelham, 1999; Menguc and Auh,
2006; Matsuno and Mentzer, 2000; Knight, 2000; Avlonitis and Gounaris, 1999).
The business owners or general managers of the selected companies were contacted
by mail, informed of the nature of our study, and asked to complete a survey
questionnaire. Follow-up reminder postcards were sent two weeks after the initial
mail-out. Of the 2,200 packets mailed, 198 were returned as undeliverable. One hundred
and sixty-three respondents returned the completed survey questionnaires. Two of
these were deleted due to a large amount of missing data. The survey, therefore,
yielded 161 usable responses, representing an 8 percent response rate.
The descriptive statistics of the companies that responded to our survey are
reported in Table I. These companies, on average, have been in business for 32 years,
with 72 employees, and have approximately $27 million dollars in annual revenue.
These statistics will be used to As suggested by Armstrong and Overton (1977), we
conducted a t-test to compare the early respondents (those who responded within the

first three weeks of mailing) and the late respondents along a number of major
variables, including MO and EO. This did not reveal any statistically significant
difference between the two groups (see Table II).
We know very little about the companies that did not respond to our survey except
for their approximate number of employees and estimated revenue. We were unable to
compare revenue between responding and non-responding companies because of a
large percentage of missing data. Therefore, we compared respondents’ number of
employees with that of the overall sample; no significant difference was found. Hence,
we believe that non-response bias is not a As a preventative measure to potential
common method bias, which refers to the artificially high correlation among constructs
due to a single measurement method (Podsakoff et al., 2003), we rigorously followed the
recommendations made by methodologists such as Busha and Harter (1980), Podsakoff
et al. (2003), and Klein (2007). For example, we used previously published scales with
demonstrated validity and reliability wherever possible, and we did not mix the
measurement items. We also inserted several open-ended questions and varied
question types among Likert scales and semantic differential scales. While these
techniques reduce common method bias, they do not eliminate it. We tested common
method bias post hoc using Harman’s single-factor test (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986).
The test revealed 27 factors with Eigen values greater than 1.00, suggesting that
common method bias is not a major concern in our data.
2.2 Construct measurement
Market Orientation (MO). Kohli et al. (1993) and Narver and Slater (1990) developed
two different measurement scales to capture the MO construct. Both scales have been
used extensively. Over the years, several scholars have extended, shortened, and
modified these scales to suit their respective research context (Gainer and Padanyi,
2005; Mavondo et al., 2005; Hult et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005). Particularly, Matsuno
et al. (2005) have demonstrated that Narver and Slater’s scale captures MO slightly
better. Hence, we used a 12-item, seven-point Likert scale, originally developed by
Narver and Slater, to capture each respondent’s perceptions of his/her company’s
customer orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-functional coordination (see the
Appendix (Figure A1) for items included in our questionnaire). These 12 items
demonstrated good reliability, with a Conbach’s alpha of 0.847. We averaged these 12
items to create a MO composite index.
Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO). This was measured with a nine-item, seven-point
semantic differential scale based on the work of Naman and Slevin (1993). The items
were designed to capture a firm’s innovativeness, pro-activeness, and risk-taking
behavior. These items also demonstrated good reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of
0.841. These items were subsequently averaged into a single EO composite index.

<-----Page 9----->Need for Achievement (NFA). The NFA was measured with a five-item, seven-point
Likert scale. The items were selected from the need for achievement subscale of Needs
Assessment Questionnaire (Heckert et al., 1999). These items demonstrated good scale
reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.886. We averaged these five items to create an
index score for NFA.
Internal Locus of Control (ILOC). This was measured with a seven-item, seven-point
Likert scale. Three items, measuring internal locus of control, were based on the work
of Rotter (1966), and the remaining four, measuring external locus of control, were
based on the work of Levenson (1973). In order to test their loading, we conducted an
exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation, which revealed that one single
factor underlies the seven items measured. Accordingly, we reverse-coded the four
items that were designed to capture external locus of control. The resulting seven items
demonstrated good reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.801. We then averaged
these seven items into one ILOC composite index.
Need for Cognition (NFC). Cacioppo et al. (1984) developed two versions of a scale to
measure NFC: a 34-item long scale and an 18-item shorter version. A recent study
reported that NFC consists of four key components: enjoyment of cognitive
stimulation, preference for complexity, commitment of cognitive effort, and desire for
understanding (Lord and Putrevu, 2006). Accordingly, we designed a four-item
measure to capture these aspects of NFC. One item did not load well and was later
dropped. The remaining three items exhibited reasonable reliability (Cronbach’s
alpha ¼ 0:704). We averaged these remaining items to create an NFC index.
Firm Performance (FP). This was measured with a three-item, seven-point
perceptual measure of a firm’s performance relative to competition. Respondents were
asked to indicate their firm’s overall sales revenue, return on investment (ROI), and
return on assets (ROA) relative to its major competitors. Such a measure has been used
by Jaworski and Kohli (1993). These three items demonstrated an excellent reliability
(Cronbach’s alpha ¼ 0:903). We averaged these three items into one firm performance
index.

2.3 Results
The correlation matrix among the constructs is presented in Table III. Notice that MO
and EO are only moderately correlated (Pearson’s correlation r ¼ 0:328, p ¼ 0:000).
We calculated a 90 percent confidence interval of their covariance. Such confidence
interval does not contain the value of 1. Therefore, the discriminate validity between
MO and EO has been met.

We established a base model, using firm performance as the dependent variable, and firm
age, number of employees, and estimated annual revenue as the independent variables:
FP ¼ b1 *Age þ b2 *Employee þ b3 *Revenue:

92

The result indicates this model is not statistically significant (p ¼ 0:265) and none of
the independent variables has significant relationship with the dependent variable
(p ¼ 0:889, 0.110, 0.733, respectively). Together, these three variables explain a very
small portion of the variance in the dependent variable (adjusted-R 2 ¼ 0:009).
H1 predicts a classic mediation relationship of NFA ! EO ! FP. Following the
method prescribed by Baron and Kenny (1986), we tested a group of regression models:
.
FP ¼ b*NFA;
.
FP ¼ b*EO; EO ¼ b*NFA; and
.
FP ¼ b1 *EO þ b2*NFA.
The results are presented in Table IV. The data confirm that NFA has a statistically
significant positive influence on performance (b ¼ 0:267, p ¼ 0:001); NFA has a
positive and significant influence on EO (b ¼ 0:413, p ¼ 0:000); and EO has a positive
influence on performance (b ¼ 0:348, p ¼ 0:000). The relationship between NFA and
performance reduces its magnitude but remains statistically significant (from
b ¼ 0:267, p ¼ 0:001 to b ¼ 0:185, p ¼ 0:031) when both NFA and EO are considered
in the same regression model. Hence, it appears that EO partially mediates NFA’s
influence on FP. H1 is supported.
The regression model FP ¼ b1*NFA þ b2*EO is statistically significant (p ¼ 0:000).
Its djusted-R 2 is 0.149. When the control variables are added, the adjusted-R 2 reduces to
0.126 due to added model complexity without additional explanatory power. But it is still
an improvement compared to the base model (DR 2 ¼ 0:117).
We also compared the relationships between NFA ! EO (b ¼ 0:413, p ¼ 0:000)
and NFA ! MO (b ¼ 0:513, p ¼ 0:000). Contrary to what we had expected, the
relationship between NFA and MO was strong. We interpret this result to mean that
entrepreneurs with high levels of NFA may regard both MO and EO as viable means
for their achievement objectives. A prior research has revealed a strong relationship
between NFA and EO (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996). The strong relationship we
discovered between NFA and MO is new and interesting. One possible explanation is
the overlap between MO and EO (correlation ¼ 0:328, p , 0.01). This overlap might
indicate that MO and EO are not mutually exclusive options. Rather, there may be
synergies between the two strategic orientations. Atuahene-Gima and Ko (2001), for
example, argue that companies that are both market- and entrepreneurial-oriented
would have the best performance outcomes.

by Baron and Kenny (1986), we tested a group of regression models:
.
FP ¼ b*ILOC;
.
FP ¼ b*EO; EO ¼ b*ILOC; and
.
FP ¼ b1 *EO þ b2*ILOC.
The results are presented in Table V. The data confirm that ILOC has a statistically
significant positive influence on FP (b ¼ 0:372, p ¼ 0:000); ILOC also has a positive
and significant influence on EO (b ¼ 0:452, p ¼ 0:000). The data also suggest that the
relationship between ILOC and FP, while still statistically significant, reduces in
magnitude (from b ¼ 0:372, p ¼ 0:000 to b ¼ 0:300, p ¼ 0:012) when both ILOC and
EO are considered in the same regression model. Hence, ILOC’s influence on FP is
partially mediated via EO. H2 is also supported.
The relationship between ILOC and EO (b ¼ 0:452, p ¼ 0:000) is much stronger than
that between ILOC and MO (b ¼ 0:165, p ¼ 0:039). Entrepreneurs with strong ILOC
tend to place more emphasis on entrepreneurial orientation and less on market
orientation, as the latter focuses on external entities, such as customers and competitors.
The regression model FP ¼ b1 *ILOC þ b2*EO is statistically significant
(p ¼ 0:000). Its adjusted R 2 is 0.182. When the control variables are added, the
adjusted-R 2 reduces to 0.138 due to added model complexity. But it is a considerable
improvement compared to the base model (DR 2 ¼ 0:129).
H3 predicts that NFC has a positive influence on FP, and that such influence is
mediated via MO. We tested a group of four regression models:

NFC has a significant influence on MO (b ¼ 0:262, p ¼ 0:001), and MO has a
significant influence on FP (b ¼ 0:182, p ¼ 0:025). NFC’s influence on FP is reduced to
insignificant (b ¼ 0:112, p ¼ 0:181) when both NFC and MO are considered in the
same regression model. Hence, NFC’s influence on FP is completely mediated via MO.
H3 is supported.
The regression model FP ¼ b1 *NFC þ b2*MO is statistically significant
(p ¼ 0:035). Its adjusted-R 2 is 0.032. When the control variables are added, the
adjusted-R 2 reduces to 0.015 due to added model complexity. But it is an improvement
compared to the base model (DR 2 ¼ 0:006).
Our data reveal that both NFC-MO (b ¼ 0:262, p ¼ 0:001) and NFC-EO (b ¼ 0:352,
p ¼ 0:000) relationships are significant indicating entrepreneurs with high levels of
NFC might have carefully assessed the benefits of MO and EO, and decided to adopt
both strategic orientations.
3. Discussion and conclusions
Scholars have long studied what criteria make entrepreneurial firms more likely to
succeed. However, a comprehensive theory of success is still absent. This paper adds
new knowledge to the strategic management of small businesses by bridging
previously segregated streams of literature. Upper echelon theory has generally
posited that an entrepreneur’s personal characteristics play critically important roles in
their firm’s behaviors and performance. RBV considers human resources, including the
entrepreneurs’ skills, experiences, and personal characteristics, as strategically
important organizational resources, and as having a positive impact on firm
performance (Barney, 1991). More recently, Ketchen et al. (2007) proposed that the
relationship between organizational resource endowments and performance is
mediated through behavioral variables. Such behaviors include the formation of a
particular type of strategic orientation for a firm.
Consistent with these prior studies and theories, this paper provides empirical
support for the positive direct and indirect links between an entrepreneur’s personal
characteristics (including internal locus of control, need for achievement, and need for
cognition) and their firm’s financial performance. Thus, our findings fit well with the
resource-based view of firms and support the notion that human capital is an important
resource endowment (Penrose, 1959), and the owners and managers of SMEs play critical
roles in the success of their firms (Jones et al. 2007). Such direct relationships have been
documented in the extant literature (Hansemark, 1998; Littenen, 2000).
More importantly, our data provide empirical support for the idea that
entrepreneurs’ decisions and organizational behaviors are the mechanisms by which
firms take advantage of resource endowments and realize their benefits. By carefully
developing appropriate strategic orientations for their company, entrepreneurs and
their senior management teams have found effective ways of utilizing their personal
contribution to create a sustainable competitive advantage for the firm, as Tsoukas
(2002) predicted. Our data confirm that the linkages between resource endowments and
firm performance are mediated by strategic choices. When entrepreneurs believe, for
example, “We will have the best products and services” (high NFA), they combine both
market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation to gain intimate understanding of
what their customers want and need, and provide their customers with the best
products and services through creativity and innovation.

<-----Page 13----->Our data also indicate that there are strategic orientation options available to
entrepreneurs. Depending on the type of available resource endowments,
entrepreneurs and managers make different strategic decisions. Prior studies have
revealed that external environmental factors affect entrepreneurs’ choice of
organizational strategic orientations. For example, in a munificent environment,
where growth opportunities are abundant, entrepreneurs are more likely to be creative
and innovative. In contrast, entrepreneurs in a more competitive environment tend to
be more cautious and are more likely to follow market signals carefully (Zhang et al.,
2007). In this paper, we demonstrate that entrepreneurs’ internal personality factors
also play a role. Our data show that entrepreneurs with internal locus of control are
likely to adopt an entrepreneurial orientation; that is, to be more proactive, innovative,
and risk-taking. Interestingly, our data indicate that possessing a higher need for
achievement does not preclude an entrepreneur from adopting a market-based
strategic orientation. Even though Lumpkin and Dess (1996) predicted a strong
relationship between NFA and EO, our data suggest that highly motivated
entrepreneurs utilize multiple means to achieve their goals for success. In other
words, high-achieving entrepreneurs fuel their innovation and creativity with market
intelligence. Their risk-taking behaviors are calculated because they understand their
customers’ needs.
Logical and pragmatic entrepreneurs with high levels of need for cognition thrive
when dealing with complex problems. They know that they must be innovative and
proactive in order to meet the market demands. In all cases, the impacts of
entrepreneurial characteristics on firm performance are mediated by either market or
entrepreneurial orientation, sometimes both.
Prior research reveals that while both MO and EO are positively correlated with
firm performance, it asserts their influences via different paths (Zhang et al., 2007).
Market-oriented firms achieve market success by appealing to their customers,
ensuring customer satisfaction, and cultivating customer loyalty. By comparison,
entrepreneurial-oriented firms opt to pursue product-related innovation or aggressive
market expansion even if it means temporarily sacrificing the satisfaction of existing
customers. This paper helps to better understand what have influenced entrepreneurs’
decisions.
Our data support the idea that entrepreneurs do not simply react to environmental
factors (Morgan and Smircich, 1980). Instead, their way of seeking and interpreting
information, and subsequently making strategy choices, is subjective and partially
influenced by their personal characteristics. By understanding the potential
antecedents and consequences of strategic choices of organizational orientations,
entrepreneurs are able to strategically seek and acquire certain types of resources, and
cultivate the most suitable organizational culture.
Although personality-related characteristics might be difficult to change,
entrepreneurs can seek strategic alliances with partners who might be endowed
with complementary characteristics or cultivate desirable characteristics. For example,
in the context of education, Perry et al. (2001) experimented with attribution retraining
programmes to change students’ perceptions of self-efficacy and locus of control. They
documented students’ successful improvement in academic achievement and enhanced
feelings of being in control. Hansemark (1998) also documented how certain
entrepreneurship training programmes can increase participants’ NFA and ILOC.

Although developing specific strategies for improving NFA, NFC, or ILOC is beyond
the scope of this paper, we demonstrate that these entrepreneurial characteristics have
both direct and indirect positive impacts on firm performance. These characteristics
are special leadership competencies worthy of future investigations (Spencer et al.,
1994) because small firms often rely upon their owner-managers’ strategizing abilities
and leadership to achieve higher organizational performance (Jones et al., 2007).

96
4. Limitations and future research
One major limitation of this study is that we relied upon cross-sectional data. Ideally, it
would be interesting to investigate the evolution of entrepreneurial strategies and the
dynamic between strategic choices, and the change in resource endowment or selective
resource acquisition. A longitudinal research design would be required to
systematically track the strategy evolution over time.
Second, this paper is still limited by the scope of its investigation. We only included
a small fraction of diverse organizational resource endowments in our model. From the
resource-based view, any resource that is scarce and valuable can be considered a
source of competitive advantage. That might include financial resources, human
resources, or technology. We only investigated entrepreneurs’ need for achievement,
need for cognition, and internal locus of control. Entrepreneurs’ strategy formulation
and evolution is affected by a large number of internal and external factors. These
factors could be macro-economic, cultural, social, or political. They could also be
accidental, personal, or totally serendipitous. Future research in these areas is needed
to investigate the related and relevant variables. Similarly, many other strategic
orientations such as relationship marketing orientation, technology orientation, and
strategy types (such as the strategy typology proposed by Miles and Snow, 1978), are
also viable alternatives to MO and EO.
The low response rate and small sample size are also important limitations to this
study. We verified that there was no systematic difference between early respondents
and late respondents in our sample. However, this verification only provides a certain
level of comfort and confidence in our data. It does not change the fact that only a small
percentage of managers whom we contacted returned our survey. Therefore, the
generalizability of the findings is seriously compromised. Also, because of the low
response rate, we had a relatively small data set to work with. The small sample size
placed limitations on the type of analysis that we could perform. In future studies, we
aim to obtain larger data sets so as to conduct more dynamic and comprehensive
testing, such as using structural equation modeling to test multi-stage, multi-path,
simultaneous relationships.
Moreover, future research is needed in both upstream and downstream directions.
In the upstream direction, we would be interested in investigating motivational aspects
of the pre-start stage of entrepreneurship. Why are certain individuals motivated to
start an entrepreneurial venture? Do they have a clear plan and are strategically
engaged in resource acquisition suited to their end goals? In the downstream direction,
we are also interested in investigating the implementation process of entrepreneurs’
strategies. In so doing, a more inclusive picture of entrepreneurship as a process would
be revealed. Such a process might include motivation to resource acquisition, strategic
choice, strategy implementation, and firm performance.

<-----Page 15----->As the global economy becomes more integrated, diversity management is also a
challenge. In some cultures, individual achievements are highly rewarded, while in
others group efforts and collaboration are more valued. It would be of great interest to
explore how a national culture acts as an antecedent or moderator of the relationship
between an entrepreneur’s personal characteristics and his/her firm’s strategic
orientations.
