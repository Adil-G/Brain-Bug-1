Abstract
Purpose – This study aims to compare rapid-growth companies with slow-growth ones in order to
provide fresh insights into the attributes of Chinese rapid-growth companies through an integrated
research framework, which was adapted from the framework proposed by Wiklund and by Barringer.
Design/methodology/approach – To obtain data for analysis, the research selected the top 30
rapid-growth firms and the bottom 30 slow-growth firms from a data bank which contains complete
financial data of 533 firms from 2001 to 2003. All data concerning rapid-growth were coded either one
or zero, and were analyzed by Fisher’s Exact Test to find out the frequency of important growth
variables.
Findings – It is found that the major differences between rapid-growth and slow-growth firms lie in
different favorite firm resources and capacities, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies.
They can create greater value for success with certain entrepreneurs, and might spur those
entrepreneurs to push their firms onto a rapid growth road. In addition, the variable of creating unique
value emerges as a strong predictor of rapid growth. Entrepreneur orientation strategy is not found to
be significantly facilitating rapid growth. This illustrates that all growth companies value highly
entrepreneurship-oriented strategy.
Practical implications – These research findings confirm that growth is not a random event and
that entrepreneurs are not necessarily natural. These research findings will promote entrepreneurship
education and entrepreneurship in China.
Originality/value – There are two originalities in this research. First, the authors developed a new
integrated framework based on previous research achievements. Second, it is the first empirical study
concerning company growth variables in China.

1. Introduction
Only a small fraction of all firms aim for, or ever achieve rapid growth. Yet, it is those
rapid-growth firms that make a disproportionate share of the creation of new jobs and
employment. Despite the fact that the average firm in the USA grows only at rate of 3.5
per cent, there exists a subset of firms that grows in a more accelerated fashion
(Barringer et al., 2005). These rapid-growth firms are not only an important stimulus to
national economy but also particular interest to academics and practitioners because
rapid growth is often an indication of market acceptance and firm success (Fesser and
Willard, 1990). Many rapid-growth firms in China, such as Lenovo, Haier, Mengniu
Ltd., have spawned new industries and spearheaded the development of innovative
products and services. By examining rapid-growth firms, researchers can help all firms
better understand the attributes associated with firm growth in China.
Despite these positive outcomes, rapid growth is difficult to achieve and maintain.
The growth rate of companies often comes to a halt because of the changing needs at
different phases during the company life cycle. In fact, according to Zook and Allen
(1999), only one in seven companies could generate and keep sustained, profitable
growth. In an earlier study, Hambrick and Crozier (1985) suggested that coping with
the stress imposed by instant size, sense of infallibility, internal turmoil, and
extraordinary resource needs are persistent challenges that managers of rapid-growth
firms have to face. Missteps in the management of any one of these challenges might
lead to the failure of an otherwise successful rapid-growth firm. These unsuccessful
rapid-growth firms in China were called as falling star firms (Yuli Zhang, 2001).
Despite the challenges associated with rapid growth, numerous surveys (e.g.
Deloitte and Touche LLP, 1996) suggest that growth is a top strategic priority for a
large percentage of firms. Rapid growth, however, is not a random or chance event, but
is associated with specific firm attributes, behaviors, strategies, and decision-making.
That is to say, to some extent, rapid-growth firms have unique characteristics among
SMEs. Researchers across the world have done much work to recognize the specific
characteristics of rapid-growth firms in many other countries, but very limited in the
Chinese context, so the purpose of this study is to add research into rapid-growth firms
in China to the literature. By using a quantitative analysis of 30 rapid-growth and 30
slow-growth firms surveyed in Tianjin City, China, this study hopes to draw
distinction in the key attributes between rapid-growth and slow-growth companies in
China and provide prescriptive advice to Chinese executives who wish to increase their
firms’ growth potential.
2. Literature review
The literature on rapid-growth firms has focused on whether there are systematic
differences between rapid-growth firms and their slow-growth counterparts, and what
these differences are. In a review of 55 research articles on firm growth published
between 1989 and 1996, Delmar (1997) concluded that there is little agreement on what
factors affect growth. In a more recent article, Delmar and Davidsson (1998) remarked
that despite increased research efforts, our knowledge about high-growth businesses is
“still very limited.” Similarly, after reviewing 68 studies on firm growth and
performance, Wiklund (1998) characterized the literature as “highly fragmented” by
analyzing 70 research articles on firm growth published between 1987 and 1997 and
suggest an integrated research frame: entrepreneurial attitudes, resources, capabilities,

<-----Page 2----->strategies, and task environment. Barringer et al. (2005) examined 106 articles, book
chapters, and books on firm growth and performance from the entrepreneurship,
management, and economics literatures between 1977 and 2003 and found that the
literature is rather rich and mature on rapid-growth firms highlighting four major
areas:
(1) entrepreneur characteristics;
(2) firm attributes;
(3) business practices; and
(4) human resource management (HRM) practices.

To review the literature, we compared key variables of the research review by Wiklund
(1998) and by Barringer et al. (2005). A summary of our findings is provided (see
Table I). Contrary to prior beliefs that the literature on firm growth is fragmented or
limited, we found that Barringer has made a great progress for the study of firm

growth. First, he found that growth is not a random event. A firm’s growth-related
attributes, its business practices, and its HRM practices make a difference in terms of
its ability to achieve and sustain rapid growth. Second, implication of the study is that
the personal characteristics of the entrepreneurs who start a firm have an impact on the
firm’s ability to achieve and maintain a rapid growth rate (Barringer et al., 2005). Three
similar factors in the two researches help us understand rapid-growth firms:
entrepreneurial resources or capabilities/entrepreneur attitudes, firm resources or
capabilities/ firm attitudes, business practices/ entrepreneurial innovativeness.
But comparing key variables of the research review by Wiklund (1998) with that by
Barringer et al. (2005), we found that the study of Barringer has some limitations:
.
The study concerned less with entrepreneurial strategy. Miller and Friesen (1978)
held the view that entrepreneurial firms highly valued innovation, and regularly
considered risk in their product-market strategies. Innovation, risk-taking and
pro-activeness are three main elements of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial
strategy, therefore, is an important dimension for studying rapid-growth firms
(Wiklund, 1998).
.
Environment seems to be ignored. Environment is a key concept in the study of
rapid-growth firms. Child (1972) argued that environment played a crucial role in
determining performance of rapid-growth firms. If the perception of the
environment is accurate, better strategy decisions will be made. Conversely,
firms will face huge risk and be in danger of bankruptcy if the perception of the
environment is inaccurate. Not only is there a fit issue between strategy and
environment, but there also needs to be a fit between the objective environment
and the perceived environment (Dess and Beard, 1984).
.
HRM was concerned too much in his research. Undoubtedly, HRM is an
important factor for SME’s growth, but Wiklund (1998) believed that
entrepreneur was even more important than the employees in SME, at the
same time, entrepreneurial strategy and the task environment of entrepreneur
was the core factor for SME’s growth.
From this point, is it possible, or even desirable, to integrate two research frames? As
suggested by Gartner et al. (1992), there is no need for the development of new theories.
Instead, Existing theories can be used. So we integrated research frameworks of
Wiklund (1998) and Barringer et al. (2005) (see Figure 1):

entrepreneurial attitudes;
entrepreneurial strategy;
firms’ resources and capabilities;
environment; and
rapid growth (see Table II).

2.1. Entrepreneurial attitudes
The relationship between entrepreneurial attitudes and firm growth is important for at
least three reasons. First, it is widely believed that the entrepreneurs of a firm place a
lasting stamp on their companies that influences the cultures and behaviors of their

firms (Mullins, 1996). Second, investors and others often assess the potential of a new
venture by evaluating the attributes of its entrepreneurs. One of the most important
criterions used by venture capitalists, for example, in deciding whether to fund a firm
is their perception of the entrepreneur’s or the entrepreneurial team’s ability to
successfully launch the venture. Third, launching a new firm is a challenging process.

680

As a result, individual difference variables, such as educational attainment and prior
industry experience, have in many instances been found to be critical in successfully
launching a new firm (Barringer et al., 2005).
2.2. Entrepreneurial strategy
Entrepreneurial strategy is an important factor for difference between rapid-growth
firms and lower-growth firms (Wiklund, 1998). First, SME strategy is different from
the strategy taken by large firms. Entrepreneurial strategy may affect all business
activities in the progress of firm growth. Second, after a firm gets established and
starts growing, the smaller firms usually are under bigger influence from
entrepreneurs. And larger firms are in need of more professional management.
Entrepreneurial strategy functions all the time. Hence, it is important for
entrepreneurship researchers to recognize the importance of entrepreneurial
dimensions of strategy in addition to individual level entrepreneurship (Miller,
1983). Wiklund (1998) suggests that entrepreneurial dimensions of a firm’s strategy are
seen as a combination of risk-taking, proclivity, and innovativeness.
2.3. Firms resource and capabilities
Resources are basic inputs in the production process, whereas capabilities refer to the
capacity for coordinating resources to perform certain tasks or activities. However, it is
difficult from a measurement perspective to separate resource availability from the
capacity to utilize these resources (Chandler and Hanks, 1993). The resource typology
used in this research is the one outlined above: present size, number of employees that
hold university degree, involvement of employees in decision making, present size
(sales), formal professional cooperation, day-to-day advisors cooperation, decision
making, and creating unique value for customers, product superiority, innovation
(Wiklund, 1998; Barringer et al., 2005).
2.4. Environment
Wiklund suggests that task environmental characteristics in terms of dynamism,
hostility and heterogeneity have been argued to be critical for suitable strategic
choices, i.e. particular strategies are likely to lead to better performance depending on
the level of environment dynamism, hostility and heterogeneity. These dimensions are
frequently used in small business growth and performance literature (Brown and
Eisenhardt, 1996; Covin et al., 1990; Miller, 1983; Miller and Toulouse, 1986).
Furthermore, Zahra (1991) suggests that each of these three dimensions should
influence entrepreneurship orientation (EO), i.e. depending on the degree of
environmental dynamism, hostility and heterogeneity; firms with a higher or lower
degree of EO may perform better or worse. So the present study about environment
includes dynamism, hostility and heterogeneity.
3. Methodology
3.1. Sample
The data used in this study came from a randomly selected set of high-growth firms
developed in close cooperation with experts at Tianjin Municipal Science and
Technology Committee (TJMSTC) in 2004. Sample population consisted of small and
middle businesses in Tianjin City in 2003. At noted above, growth and performance

<-----Page 6----->dates were to be assessed over three years interval, and 2001-2003 were the most recent
three years available. Thus, the population did not consist of all SMEs in Tianjin City.
The population represent a subset of a larger database of SMEs that were regional
winners of the most growth potential SMEs. The selection of the programme
recognizes firms with growth potential in seven different industries, ranging from
manufacturing to health care. The cases had been surveyed by a questionnaire and
include questions about growth firms in the following areas:
.
business environment;
.
types of business and current activity;
.
management team;
.
innovativeness;
.
future planning;
.
performance and growth in 2001-2003.

A quantitative
analysis

681

Before a firm is designated as a subject, it must submit an officially audited financial
statement. Each of the received questionnaire was accompanies by sufficient financial
information for us to compute a three-year compound annual growth rate.
The questionnaire took the form of a five-point Likert scale. All data which reflected
the basic situation of those enterprises are objective. The research took “Quantitative
content analysis” method in order to survey the differences between rapid-growth and
low-growth firms. We sorted all data into the category of “1” or “0”, and made the
analyses by Fisher’s Exact Test (Barringer et al., 2005).
For the purpose of this study, we define a rapid-growth firm as one with a three-year
compound annual growth rate of 40 per cent or higher, and a slow-growth firm as one
with a three-year compound annual growth rate of 5 per cent or lower. To obtain data
for analysis, we selected top 30 rapid-growth firms and bottom 30 slow-growth firms
based on the data bank in which there were 533 firms with complete financial data for
previous two years (2001 to 2003). The total number of the firms in the data bank is
1,044. From these firms in Tianjin City, multiple criteria were used to define a sample
of high-growth firms (N ¼ 31). Each questionnaire was addressed to a top executive of
the selected firm, and anonymity was assured. Questionnaires were mailed to SMEs in
Tianjin City. Table III contains demographic statistics pertaining to the sample along
with t tests to compare the rapid-growth firms against the slow-growth firms on
number of employees, annual sales, three-year compound annual growth rate, and firm

age. As shown, the three-year compound annual growth rate for the 30 rapid-growth
firms ranged from a low of 43 per cent to a high of 998 per cent, with an average growth
rate of 152.7 per cent. In contrast, the three-year compound annual growth rate of the
30 firms in the slow-growth group ranged from a low of 2 25 per cent to a high of 15
per cent, with an average growth rate of 0.28 per cent. Furthermore, there are no
significant differences between the two samples on number of employees or annual
sales. As expected, the rapid-growth firms are younger (see Table III).
Data were collected by mail questionnaire survey. Responses were received (23 per
cent response rate). There were 13 blank questionnaires and 67 questionnaires with a
high proportion of missing data (25 per cent or more) and they were excluded. Thus, 80
firms gave responses that were usable for analysis. In addition, answers to the
performance items were well distributed across the answer range. Non-response bias
was assessed on the basis that later respondents could be more like non-respondents
(Armstrong and Overton, 1977). The responses of later respondents were found not to
be statistically different (sig. 0.05) from responses of earlier respondents for all
questionnaire items for both samples. In addition, response bias was assessed by
comparing the structure of the firm size of respondents with the database population.
As expected, because of the randomness of the sample, the selected firms and all firms
matched in terms of size distribution in Tianjin City.
3.2. Method of analysis
Table IV presents the categories and variables that emerged from the study.
Throughout the analysis, we were interested in the extent to which the firms in the
sample emphasized these variables. The frequency of emphasis for each variable,
broken down by rapid-growth versus slow-growth firms, is shown in Table IV. We
chose this method of frequency analysis to ensure that “vivid, but false impressions”
(Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990; Barringer et al., 2005) were not regarded as more
meaningful and pervasive than otherwise might be inferred without such frequencies.
A one-tailed, Fisher’s Exact Test was used to test the differences between the
frequencies for the rapid-growth and slow-growth firms. As shown in Table IV, the
rapid-growth firms differed from the slow-growth firms with regard to their intensity
of emphasis on 14 of the 21 variables identified. The data were analyzed with the
assistance of the statistics software program SPSS 11. Through the analysis, several
variables were significantly different between the rapid-growth firms and the
slow-growth firms in our sample.
In an effort to increase confidence in the reliability of the analysis, we surveyed a
randomly-selected subset of ten firms with same questionnaire, and analyzed the
results. The results were then compared with the original one. The reliability scale of
the early analyzed is 0.63. The reliability scale of the original questionnaire is high
(Alp ¼ 0.71).
4. Discussion of the results of the analysis
These variables including relevant industry experience, entrepreneurial experience,
age, present size, rate of employees that hold university degree, growth-oriented vision
and mission, day-to-day advisors cooperation, creating unique value for customers,
product superiority, innovation, dynamism, hostility, heterogeneity, and proclivity
were higher than other variables in our study. The rapid-growth firms in the sample

create unique value for their customers to a higher degree than their slower-growth
counterparts. This result is the same as the result of Barringer et al. (2005).
4.1 Entrepreneurial attitudes
The rapid-growth firms differed from the slow-growth firms on relevant industry
experience, entrepreneurial experience, age. No differences were found for prior
industry experience, high education, entrepreneur gender and management ground.
Entrepreneurs with prior experience in the same or a closely related industry were
found in 60 per cent of the rapid-growth firms in the sample and only in 30 per cent of
the slow-growth firms. Apparently, related industry experience provides an
entrepreneur with critical knowledge plus the advantage of access to a network of
contacts that can help a firm overcome liability of newness and build a growth-oriented
business.
The study was not affirmed the importance of higher education, though we suggest
that higher education can provide an entrepreneur with the skills necessary to launch a
venture, particularly if the venture is in a technology-oriented industry such as
biotechnology or computer science. But the result of the analysis seems to suggest that

15,4

entrepreneurs between rapid-growth firms and lower-growth firms are not different at
higher education in China.
As expected, entrepreneurs of the rapid-growth firms are younger versus the
slow-growth firms in the sample. As the proverb in China is “Life begins at 40”, we
used 40 years of age as a dividing line to measure the youth of entrepreneurs. We found
that entrepreneurs are younger in rapid-growth firms than in lower-growth firms.

684
4.2. Firms resource and capabilities
The rapid-growth firms in the sample differ from the slow-growth firms on firm size,
rate of employees that hold university degree, growth-oriented vision and mission,
day-to-day advisors cooperation, creating unique value for customers, product
superiority, and innovation. No differences between the two groups were found in
involvement of employee in decision making or formal professional cooperation.
In terms of employee scale of growth firms it was found that 77 per cent of the
rapid-growth firms in the sample had less than 50 employees in comparison of only 40
per cent in lower-growth firms. Apparently, smaller firms may grow more rapidly than
larger firms. Rapid-growth firms had a higher percentage of employees who hold
university degree than lower-growth firms.
With regard to vision to growth, we have found that growth is an important
objective for most firms and that lack of growth can be attributed to both external and
internal factors, including motivational issues. As a result, the intensity of a firm’s
vision to growth may motivate the members of a firm to make growth a reality. A
growth-oriented vision may crystallize the activities of a firm and lead to the
implementation of purposeful growth-oriented activities (Kim and Mauborgne, 1997).
The final firm attribute that was emphasized to a significantly higher degree by the
fast-growth firms in the sample was day-to-day advisors cooperation. Relationships of
day-to-day advisors cooperation co-opt a portion of their resource needs from their
growth process.
The rapid-growth firms in the sample differed from the slow-growth firms with
regard to creating unique value for customer, product superiority, and innovation.
Creating unique value is defined as helping a customer maximize utility, reduce costs,
and/or increase organizational effectiveness in a unique manner (Barringer et al., 2005).
Although the variable creating unique value is rarely discussed in the rapid-growth
literature, it emerged as a strong discriminator between the rapid-growth and the
slow-growth firms in the sample. This result is the similar to that of Barringer et al.
(2005). Another two variables that differentiated firms in the sample were product
superiority and innovation. Fast-growth firms were more likely to make a keen sense of
product superiority and innovation.
4.3 Perceived environment
The rapid-growth firms in the sample differed from the slow-growth firms with regard
to dynamism, hostility, heterogeneity in task environment (Wiklund, 1998).
Environment dynamism refers to the amount and unpredictability of change in
customer preferences, products or service technologies, and method of competition in
firm’s principle industry. Heterogeneity is evidenced by the differences in competitive
markets. Hostility is manifested by distribution competition. The environment is the

<-----Page 10----->major determinant of firm development. This study revealed that the environment was
different between rapid-growth firms and lower-growth firms.
It is interesting to note that there are bigger differences among the rapid-growth
firms and lower-growth firms. It is possible to speculate that this could be because
firms with more of an entrepreneurial orientation, to a larger extent, aim at
environment which allows greater growth opportunities. A contradictory
interpretation is also possible. It may be that growth is pulled along by the
environment (Wiklund, 1998).
4.4. Entrepreneurial strategy
The rapid-growth firms in the sample differed from the slow-growth firms with regard
to proclivity in entrepreneur orientation strategy. No differences were found between
two groups in terms of risk-taking and innovativeness.
In small business firms the strategy orientation of CEO is likely to be the same as
the strategic orientation of the firm. In line with the majority of reviewed research,
entrepreneur orientation strategy consists of three separate dimensions: proclivity,
risk-taking and innovativeness. But unexpectedly, we could find no difference in
risk-taking and innovativeness and this result may be attributable to the small sample
of this study.
5. Conclusions
Most of the findings in this research affirm the statements in existing literature on
rapid-growth firms. The characteristics of the entrepreneur of a firm, along with firm
resources and capacities, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies, are
important in helping a firm achieve rapid growth. The results of the study are
important because they confirm the results in existing literature based on quantitative
analysis on lager scale survey in China.
First, different variables were identified, based on evidence in the integrated
research frame and a large scale survey in China, 2004. For example, favorite firm
resources and capacities, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies can create
greater value for success with certain entrepreneurs, which might spur them to push
their firms onto a trajectory of rapid growth.
Second, the variable creating unique value emerged as a strong predictor of rapid
growth. Although Barringer regards this variable conceptually similar to Porter’s
(1985) concept of product differentiation, the results of this study suggest that unique
value is a separate concept, and it refers to an ability to offer good products or service
to help customers maximize utility, reduce costs, and/or increase organizational
effectiveness in a unique manner. This result is the similar to the result of Barringer
et al. (2005).
Finally, the results of this study draw attention to the importance of entrepreneur
orientation strategy in facilitating rapid growth researches. But not as expected,
risk-taking and innovativeness were not different. We think that our data may be
limited and this will need further exploration in the future.
6. Implications and observation
First, it has been confirmed that growth is not a random event (Barringer et al., 2005;
Wiklund, 1998). A firm’s growth-related attributes, namely, entrepreneur attitudes,

resources and capabilities of the firm, task environment, and entrepreneurial strategies
make a difference in its ability to achieve and sustain rapid growth. The
growth-facilitating variables identified in this study are shown in Table IV.
Entrepreneurs who lead growth-minded firms may benefit by taking into account these
factors and considering the extent to which their firms have addressed these variables.
For example, one of the strongest findings in the study is that firms that have made a
proclivity growth are more likely to achieve rapid growth than low-growth firms. The
same important finding is that firms with growth-oriented vision and mission are more
likely to achieve rapid growth than low-growth firms. The research findings show that
growth-orientated firms are more entrepreneurial. Growth-oriented vision and mission
are important indicators for measuring firm growth.
A second implication of the study is that entrepreneurs are not necessarily naturally
born. The most important variables in this research are relevant industry experience.
Entrepreneurs who start a firm have an impact on the firm’s ability to achieve and
maintain a rapid growth rate by acquired experience and learning.
To conclude the paper, we would like to make two observations about the present
study. First, all of the categories of variables examined in the study came from a
narrow point of view. For instance, although the literature on rapid-growth firms is
converging, there is a need for more integration across the categories of variables that
are associated with rapid growth, but our conceptual models was only depicted by
integrating the research frameworks of Wiklund (1998) and of Barringer et al. (2005).
So cross-integration of topics, like firm attributes and business practices, will push the
literature on rapid-growth firms forward and enrich the debate. Second, although our
research is based on a big sample in China, the adopted Fisher’s Exact Test is only a
frequency analysis (Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1990). So we suggest that a more
reliable research method could be used in future.
