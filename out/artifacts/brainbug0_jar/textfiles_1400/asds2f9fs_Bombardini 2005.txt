Abstract
We employ a novel data set to estimate a structural econometric model of the decisions under risk
of players in a game show where lotteries present payoﬀs in excess of half a million dollars. Diﬀerently
from previous studies in the literature, the decisions under risk of the players in presence of large payoﬀs
allow to estimate the parameters of the curvature of the vN-M utility function not only locally but also
globally. Our estimates of relative risk aversion indicate that a constant relative risk aversion parameter
of about one captures the average of the sample population. In addition we find that individuals are
practically risk neutral at small stakes and risk averse at large stakes, a necessary condition, according to
Rabin (2000) calibration theorem, for expected utility to provide a unified account of individuals’ attitude
towards risk. Finally, we show that for lotteries characterized by substantial stakes non-expected utility
theories fit the data equally well as expected utility theory.

Introduction

In its most basic formulation decision theory oﬀers a simple way to compare the degree of risk aversion across
individuals. Individual A is globally more risk averse than individual B if the certainty equivalent of lottery
L for individual A is lower than the certainty equivalent for individual B and if this is true for any lottery
L. Armed with such a simple method, the ideal experiment to measure risk aversion would be to present
subjects with simple lotteries and ask them to reveal their certainty equivalent to each lottery. Under specific
parametric assumptions about the utility function it is possible to translate these certainty equivalents into a
quantity that represents the degree of risk aversion of the individual. Further, according to expected utility
theory, risk aversion derives from the curvature of the utility of money, so such experiment would require to
vary the stakes of the lotteries proposed in order to trace out the shape of the utility of money.
What we just described is very similar to the setup involved in the Italian game show “Aﬀari Tuoi” which
is the subject of this paper. A detailed description of the game rules is provided in the following section,
but the main choice contestants make in this game can be easily summarized in the following example. At
a given stage of the game the contestant is holding a closed box that might contain either 1 euro or 100, 000
euros. At this point the contestant is oﬀered 33, 000 euros and must decide whether to accept this certain
payoﬀ or face a lottery where the prizes 1 and 100, 000 euros are equally likely. If the contestant accepts
the oﬀer, then 33, 000 euros is an upper bound on her certainty equivalent. If the contestant rejects the
oﬀer, then 33, 000 euros is a lower bound on her certainty equivalent1 . A given contestant is asked to make
this simple choice several times and facing diﬀerent lotteries during the same episode, therefore we observe
multiple decisions for the same individual. From such decisions one is able to estimate risk preferences, the
first objective of this paper.
According to Harrison and List (2004) what we study in this paper is a ‘natural experiment’ since we did
not intervene in designing the rules of the game. The reason why we prefer to call this a ‘field’ experiment
is that it presents several features that we would have chosen, were we to design such an experiment.
First, observe that in order to mimic the ideal experiment that we described above, one has to design the
experiment so that the subject is asked to reveal the certainty equivalent of the lottery. Truthful revelation
is possible to enforce only with incentive compatible schemes (BDM for instance). In this game the fact
that the oﬀer is take-or-leave and is made only once to the same person prevents the subject from playing
strategically and guarantees that the choice involves only risk preferences.
Second, given the established anomalies in the behavior of individuals in the presence of infinitesimally
small probabilities placed on extremely large payoﬀs, such as in the case of lottery tickets, it is desirable
to present the subject with few prizes and finite and identical probabilities. This also guarantees that the
choice is not aﬀected by the ability to assign the correct probabilities to each outcome.
Third, as required to recover the entire shape of the utility of money, the experiment entails small stakes
lotteries, involving 1 or 500 euros as well as large stakes lotteries, where the payoﬀ can reach 500, 000 euros.
1 This

game was actually played by Maria Grazia Rovai, a housekeeper from Vasto, on May 17, 2005. She rejected the oﬀer

and won 1 euro.

2

<-----Page 2----->It is clear that no empirical researcher would have what ex-post turned out to be a budget in excess of 7
million euros.
The ability to trace out the utility of money over what we believe is a relevant range allows us to
address the point raised by Rabin (2000) who predicts that “data sets dominated by modest-risk investment
opportunities are likely to yield much higher estimates of risk aversion than data sets dominated by largerscale investment opportunities”. Rabin implies that the same underlying utility of money cannot be used
when considering small and large-stake lotteries. We find that logarithmic utility fits the data accurately
when we consider both small and large-stake lotteries. In Figure 1A the horizontal axis measures the expected
value of the lottery (in our example above it corresponds to 50, 000 euros) while the vertical axis measures
the oﬀer made to a contestant that faced such lottery. Each lottery is a simple two-payoﬀ object, just like
our introductory example. In general accepted oﬀers lie above points indicating rejected oﬀers for a given
expected value of the lottery. Moreover if we locally fit a line through the oﬀers corresponding to each lottery
(therefore tracing the locus of indiﬀerence, the solid line) we find a curve that almost coincides with the
logarithmic function represented on the same graph. For comparison, notice that the linear utility and a
CRRA utility with a coeﬃcient of risk aversion equal to 2 do a much poorer job at describing the data. In
Figure 1B, where lotteries have a five-payoﬀs structure, the story is similar.
Consider now what the Rabin’s calibration theorem predicts. If we see anything but almost risk neutrality
at small stakes then we are bound to observe unrealistically high risk aversion at large stakes. This time
a graphical representation helps showing how close our results come to Rabin’s prediction. Figure 2 shows
the subset of lotteries shown in Figure 1A with prizes below 18, 000 euros. As Rabin predicts, at lower
stakes the subjects are almost risk neutral, as the comparison between logarithmic utility and linear utility
clearly shows. Therefore not only our results present a useful benchmark in measuring risk preferences when
the individual decisions are important and involve significant amounts of money, which to the best of our
knowledge is a new result, but also produce evidence in favor of expected utility theory. This is the second
contribution of the paper.

1.1

Related literature

In light of all the desirable features of this experiment, we see many of the previous experiments set out to
assess risk preferences to lack one or more such ideal conditions.
As pointed out by Harrison and List (2004) many of the experiments conducted in the lab involve college
students because of availability and proximity to academic researchers. In order to obtain more representative
subject pools, field experiments draw samples on populations with wider demographics. Similarly, the
subjects of this experiment diﬀer in terms of age, education, income, geographical origins in a way that, as
we will later explain, makes them reasonably representative of the population. This is not the case for other
game show studies like Metrick (1995) where the author admits the contestants are “wealthier and better
educated than the average person”.
The issue of ability is not just a concern from a selection or self-selection point of view, it is possibly a

3

<-----Page 3----->more important concern if we believe it cannot be separated from risk preferences. This might happen if
ability, like in the case of ‘Jeopardy!’, aﬀects the assessment of one’s probability to answer a question or the
calculation of fairly complicated winning odds like in ‘Card Sharks’ and ‘Lingo’. Using the latter game show,
Metrick (1995) is constrained to employing the average probability that the contestant will answer a question
correctly to assess the degree of risk aversion of the participant by looking at how much the subject wagers.
It is clear that the participant’s own assessment of her ability to answer a future question might interfere
with risk preferences in determining the amount wagered. Metrick’s results do not allow him to reject the
hypothesis of risk neutrality2 . Another consideration, we believe, makes Metrick (1995) study of ‘Jeopardy!’
not suited to evaluate risk preferences. In this study the strategic component is essential as subjects are not
facing just risk, but also have to evaluate the other contestants behavior and choose their best response. This
involves the ability of the participant to assess the other person’s winning probabilities and adds another layer
of complication. Potentially strategic behavior stands in the way of a simple estimation of risk preferences3 .
The problem with the setup in Gertner (1993) and Beetsma and Schotman (2001) is of a diﬀerent nature.
In his study of the game show ‘Card Sharks’ Gertner assumes that contestants can calculate the probability of
picking, given a certain card, a higher-ordered card from a deck without replacement . The same problem is
present in ‘Lingo’, where contestants have to evaluate the probability of extracting balls from an urn without
replacement. Although the authors claim these are simple lotteries, we cannot be completely confident that
the ability to compute probabilities does not interfere with risk preferences. This might be the reason why
Gertner (1993) and Beetsma and Schotman (2001) obtain relatively high coeﬃcients of relative risk aversion.4
Compare also to non-game settings, the experiment in this study exhibits considerable advantages. Take
for example the work of Jullien and Salanié (2000), where racetrack bets are used to estimate risk preferences.
They are constrained to adopting a representative agent approach due to the lack of information on individual
bettors. In our sample we are able to identify a few important individual characteristics and therefore allow
for heterogeneity in risk preferences. Most important among these is income, which allows us to adopt
constant relative risk aversion utility. Allowing for unobserved heterogeneity has appealing features as shown
by Cohen and Einav (2005). In their paper they present an interesting application of this methodology, albeit
in a more complex environment (the choice of insurance deductibles) that requires accounting for adverse
selection and moral hazard, which substantially complicates the estimation.
This and other studies, making use of insurance decisions to evaluate risk preferences like Cicchetti and
Dubin (1994), involve more complicated lotteries than the ones we analyze in this paper and payoﬀs that are
several orders of magnitude smaller. The nature of the lottery might be problematic since individuals are
expected to make a decision about buying insurance based on knowledge of the exact probability of a car
2 When
3 Other

probabilities are subjective though, over-confidence can be mistaken for risk neutrality, as Metrick himself recognizes.
studies involving game shows are also not able to address the issue of risk preferences as they focus on testing strategic

behavior and rationality. For instance Berk et al. (1996) study of ‘The Price is Right’ looks at the ability of participants to
choose best responses and finds that strategic errors are frequent when players are supposed to choose their optimal bids.
4 Gertner’s point estimate is 4.8 which is considerably higher than what we obtain in this study. Beetsma and Schotman’s
estimates vary depending on the reference income level, but are well above 3 for income levels comparable to the ones used in
our study.

<-----Page 4----->accident or telephone line failure. Arguably a 50-50 lottery over two cash prizes is a simpler problem for the
individual to evaluate. The size of the lottery stakes is also problematic for these studies because insurance
deductibles and telephone line failures do not involve sums larger than a few hundred dollars. Such small
bets simply do not allow to trace out significant portions of the utility of income.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and presents the principal features of
the game show in detail. Section 3 presents a model of the contestant’s dynamic decision problem and its
solution. Section 4 reports the estimation results of the model and oﬀers an empirical interpretation of
Rabin (2000). Section 5 extends the econometric analysis to non-expected utility paradigms and provides a
comparison with the estimates obtained under expected utility theory. Section 6 presents our conclusions.

The Game

Structure
In an episode of “Aﬀari Tuoi” (literally “Your Business”) each of 20 participants, representative of each
Italian region, is assigned a box, numbered from 1 to 205 ). Each box contains a prize which can be monetary
or in-kind6 . Winnings are always paid through a wire transfer so objects represent a certain monetary
amount and serve the only purpose of entertainment7 . Table 1A reports the distribution of prizes contained
in the twenty boxes. It is worth noticing that these prizes are considerably large, not only compared to
the usual experimental settings8 , but also relative to previous studies of game shows. For instance Gertner
(1993) employs results from the game ‘Card Sharks’ where the stakes are up to $16, 000 and the average
winnings are $3, 200. In Metrick (1995) the potential stakes are higher but winnings above $50, 000 represent
only 6 percent of the total. In this game the set of prizes include 100, 000 euros, 250, 000 euros, up to 500, 000
euros. The stakes are sizable compared to lifetime wealth for some of the participants.
The game consists of two phases: an introductory part and the main game. The first part consists of a
single question. The person who gets the right answer9 in the shortest time gains access to the main phase
of the game. This phase is the subject of our study. In this part of the game the contestant is interviewed
shortly by the host and usually reveals some information about herself that we employ in this study. We
do not have access to any information beyond the details provided by the participants themselves10 . We
always know the region of provenience of the participant and the gender. Usually the participant reveals
whether she is from a specific city or from the countryside, her occupation, whether she is married and has

notary randomly assigns each prize to each box. In-kind prizes are assigned a monetary value by RAI (Radiotelevisione

Italiana) and they never exceed 500 euros value.
7 All prizes with face value smaller than 50 euro are paid 50 euros. This is accounted for in the estimation.
8 For experiments involving relatively high monetary incentives see Holt and Laury (2002) and the study on Beijing University
participants in Kachelmeier and Shehata (1992).
9 The question is usually of very peculiar nature and does not appear to reflect contestant’s ability or knowledge more than
sheer luck in guessing. An example would be "How many churches in Italy are dedicated to Saint Paul?". Random access to
the main section of the game does not seem an unreasonable assumption in this light.

to describe the approximate age of the participant, generally a 10-year window.
The main game begins with the participant holding the originally assigned box. She is asked to pick one
of the remaining nineteen boxes. The chosen box is opened and the prize contained is revealed. The opened
box and its corresponding prize drop out of the set of possible winnings for the participant. In the same
fashion the participant chooses and opens five more boxes. Every time a box is opened it drops out of the
game along with the prize it contains. After the first six boxes are opened an oﬀer is made. An oﬀer can
take the form of a monetary amount or of a “change”. If the oﬀer is a monetary amount, the participant has
the option of accepting the amount of money oﬀered and abandon the game or to continue and open more
boxes. When the oﬀer is a change the participant has the option of substituting the box she holds in her
hands with one of the remaining unopened boxes. If the monetary oﬀer is rejected or if the oﬀer is in the
form of a change then 3 more boxes are opened before the next oﬀer, and so on. If no oﬀer is ever accepted
the contestant wins the prize in the box she is holding. This implies that there are up to a maximum of five
oﬀers per episode11 . At the final (fifth) oﬀer in particular there are two boxes unopened, one of which is
in the hands of the participant. This is, along with the fourth oﬀer, when most of the ‘drama’ of the game
unravels as the participant often faces very diﬀerent potential prizes and is torn between accepting a safe
oﬀer, which is always lower than the mean of the two prizes, and facing a lottery. Table 1B shows the timing
of the game.
The oﬀers are made by a person, named by the host as the “Infame”, literally the “Infamous”, who
communicates with the host through a telephone during the show. The oﬀerer knows the content of the box
in the hands of the participant and decides the oﬀer to make based solely on the behavior of the participant
and the information that is revealed about the player during the episode12 . When we interviewed the
“Infame” he admitted not using any specific algorithm or any aid other than his own experience. What
we observe in the data is that there is a positive correlation between the content of the box held by the
contestant at the time the oﬀer is made and the amount of money oﬀered, controlling for the size of the
lottery. For instance the correlation between the monetary oﬀer (relative to the expected value of the lottery)
and the relative content of the box held by the contestant is 0.36 at the fifth oﬀer and 0.32 at the fourth oﬀer.
This positive correlation suggests that the oﬀerer finds it profitable to “convince” the contestant to forego
a high prize by oﬀering a relatively high amount more frequently than when the contestant has nothing in
her hands. In Appendix A we suggest a theoretical framework to describe the equilibrium behavior of the
oﬀerer. In the empirical estimation we take the behavior of the oﬀerer as given and use the equilibrium
strategy that we observe13 .

The show “Aﬀari Tuoi” which means literally ‘your business’ aired for the first time on the Italian
television channel RAI 1 on October, 13th 2003 and has been on the air for four seasons14 . The show was

the producing company and a Dutch multinational, is the owner of the show’s format and holds the rights to
produce and lease the format to the various TV stations. The show is vastly popular in Italy with peaks of
share of 40 percent in prime time. This leaves no doubt as to whether the participants observed the structure
of the show and were aware of the choices involved in the game.
We collected information about the participants selection by interviewing one of the three authors of
the game. Before the show started the game was unknown and no ads had been run. Endemol contacted
several associations and cultural groups that might suggest the name of possible participants. After the first
season candidates started applying and selections were made from the pool of applicants. The interview was
limited to a few minutes and did not involve any questions regarding risk attitudes or previous gambling
experiences. Throughout the four seasons the only two criteria followed to select participants were telegenic
look and ‘average’ income. According to the first criterion people were selected who showed an entertaining
personality and/or looks. According to the second criterion participants that were believed to have high
incomes were rejected. As one of the authors puts it: “We would not select the wife of a jeweler”. While we
believe the former criterion does not create severe selection bias, the latter criterion might make the sample
not representative of the population. This feature of the selection also limits the extent to which we can
compare risk attitudes across income levels in this study. As we admit this potential problem, we should
report that the intention of the authors was to select the “average Italian” so that the audience could relate
to the participant. However, based on observables, participants appear close to the median of the general
population, with some evident diﬀerence only in the over-representativeness of small regions (both relatively
rich, like Valle D’Aosta, and relatively poor, like Basilicata and Molise).
Self-selection is a concern in this set-up where participation is entirely voluntary and where there is
certainly a cost for participating. In particular one might suggest that the show might attract relatively
more risk-loving subjects and this would bias the estimate of risk aversion downwards. To address this
concern, we asked the authors what seemed the main motivation behind the participants’ applications.
Many reported the “desire to be on TV” as the main reason for applying, followed by “the need for some
cash”. Moreover, as described above, participants were contacted by the producers in the first season. This
allows us to test whether self-selection is an issue in the subsequent seasons employing a contrast of time
indicators or considering the presence of time trends in our estimates. Self-selection would also be a concern
if this show required a specific skill or a relatively high level of education. The lack of requirements along
this dimension makes self-selection not an issue in this respect.

The Model

This section models the structure of the contestant decision problem explicitly, as required by the estimation
procedure. In order to present the individual problem concisely we describe two nested alternatives concern1 5 Given

the success of the show the previous host, Paolo Bonolis, successfully negotiated a multimillion contract with a

diﬀerent broadcaster.

7

<-----Page 7----->ing the informational content of the oﬀers. Under the first alternative oﬀers reveal nothing concerning the
content of the box held by the contestant at the time of the oﬀer. Under the second alternative we discuss
the case where oﬀers have informational content. The contestant optimally makes use of such information.
Finally we present some remarks concerning the role of the oﬀerer.

The contestant’s decision problem

3.1.1

Preferences

For each game show played by a contestant t = 1, ..., T,16 let ut (yt ) indicate t’s vN-M utility function where
yt represents t’s wealth and the contestant is assumed to behave as an expected utility maximizer. We allow
for heterogeneity in the contestants’ preferences for risk and parameterize ut (yt ) by a random vector θt joint
normally distributed N (Mt , Σt ) and independently across t’s. An (important) benchmark example we will
1−γ t

employ throughout is ut (yt ) being constant relative risk aversion (CRRA), i.e. ut (yt ) = yt
γ t ∼ N (µt , σ t ).

The optimization problem

Let us consider the problem of contestant t (indexes are omitted). Define a stage s of the game as the phase
of the game when an oﬀer is made and the contestant has to decide to accept or reject the oﬀer. From the
description in Section 2 we set s ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. At stage s the contestant faces a lottery characterized by a

set of prizes Ks and corresponding probabilities Ps . The set Ks = {ki } consists of prizes not yet discovered
at stage s and Ps consists of the probabilities assigned to each of those prizes being held by the contestant:
Ps = {pi |ki ∈ Ks } ,
with

P

pi = 1, so for instance at s = 1, pi = 1/14. Denote also the (unknown) prize contained in the

i

contestant’s box as ki0 ∈ Ks .

Suppose now that at every stage s the participant is presented with a (positive) monetary oﬀer17 , that

we indicate with ms . The contestant’s decision consists of either accepting the oﬀer, thereby terminating
the game and renouncing the option value of playing, or rejecting the oﬀer and proceeding to the next stage
s + 1. Accepting an oﬀer is therefore an absorbing state. Indicate the decision by the contestant at stage s
as ds ∈ {0, 1} , where ds = 1 if the oﬀer is accepted and ds = 0 if the oﬀer is rejected.

At s the contestant compares the utility from the monetary oﬀer ms with the continuation value from

rejecting the oﬀer and therefore faces a dynamic optimization problem where the value function of the

possibility that the oﬀer consists of an change of boxes is not relevant for the contestant’s problem under the assumption

A1 (below), as it will become clear in the following section. For this reason in this section we consider only monetary oﬀers in
the game. This simplifies the exposition and the analysis. The Appendix contains the formulation inclusive of the “change”
option.

ds ∈{0,1}

In (1) Es [·] indicates the expectation operator conditional on the information set at s, Ωs , and the state
of the game (Ks , Ps ). The expectation E operates over all the possible paths implied by the sequence of box
openings and over the distribution of oﬀers conditional on the lottery faced by the contestant at the next
stage s+1. Let h̃s+1 be a discrete random variable that indicates the path followed between stage s and stage
s + 1 of the game. h̃s+1 has support of dimension Hs+1 , where Hs+1 is the number of possible combinations
of triplets of prizes out of the remaining set Ks . For instance, since K4 is composed of five prizes, then the
¡¢
number of possible paths followed by opening any three boxes and discovering three prizes in K4 is 52 = 10.
Hence, H5 = 10 and the realizations h5 ∈ {1, 2, ..., 10}. Indicate with q (hs+1 ) the probability of a specific

path hs+1 being followed. Let m̃s+1 be a (discrete) random variable distributed according to the probability

distribution fs+1 (ms+1 |hs+1 ). That is, fs+1 (.) is the distribution of the oﬀer at stage s + 1, which is a
function of the path followed between s and s + 1, and captures the equilibrium strategy of the oﬀerer. The

discreteness assumption of m̃s+1 is made solely for consistency with our empirical implementation.

where we use the notation Ps+1 (hs+1 ) and Ks+1 (hs+1 ) to emphasize that they depend on the actual path
followed. The player information set Ωs at s includes the distributions q(.) and fs+1 (.). The expression (2)
relies on the assumption:
A1 : Oﬀer m̃s follows a probability distribution fs (ms |hs ) independent of the prize held ki0 ∈ Ks .
Given A1 the probability of each path considered by the contestant is constant at any s:
q (hs ) = 1/Hs
and so are the probabilities assigned to each remaining prize:

where the function n (Ks ) simply indicates the number of elements of Ks . The expression (3) presents a
trivial form of updating (i.e. counting the boxes remaining). Moreover, given that the opening of the boxes
is performed by an uninformed contestant, there is no Monty Hall’s problem18 in the computation of Ps .

Solution and estimation of the dynamic model

The solution of the problem is numerical. Consider an oﬀer at the last stage of the game, s = 5, when only
prizes K5 = {ki , kj } are left and the probability of the participant having prize ki in her box is pi = 1/2.

The maximal (1) can be rewritten as:

V5 (P5 , K5 , m5 )
=

max {d5 u(y + m5 ) + (1 − d5 ) [u(y + ki )pi + u(y + kj )(1 − pi )]} .

d5 ∈{0,1}

Therefore the final decision is:
d5 = I [u(y + m5 ) > (u(y + ki ) + u(y + kj ))/2] .

(4)

In (4), I [·] is an indicator function taking value 1 if the expression in brackets is true, 0 otherwise. For any
possible pair of prizes in the set K4 such decision can be calculated. It follows that (1) can be solved by
¡¢
backward recursion. For instance, when oﬀer m4 is made there are 52 = 10 possible ending pairs at stage 5
to be considered in the choice made at 4.

Within an episode a contestant is assumed to solve the model above. Data consist of her observed
choices for each actual oﬀer and the complete evolution of the prize distribution. Since the opening of boxes
produces randomly independent draws and therefore the evolution of the prize distribution is exogenous, the
probability of any sequence of choices for stages 1, ..., S̄ ≤ 5, where S̄ is the ending stage, is given by:
Pr [d1 , ..., dS̄ ] =

S̄
Q

s=1

Pr [ds |Ps , Ks , ms ] .

(5)

The likelihood contribution of the game played by a contestant t is therefore given by (5) with the addition
of the appropriate indexing by t of decisions, oﬀers, and lotteries. Hence, the log likelihood of the model for
the T game shows recorded is given by:

Solution and estimation of the static (myopic) model

Finally, consider the problem of a static contestant, that is a myopic player who disregards the continuation value of (1) and at every stage decides according to a static rule depending exclusively upon her risk
preferences:

where the summation is over the remaining prizes in Ks . Notice that ignoring the dynamic component of

of the game the contestant exclusively evaluates oﬀers and lotteries according to her taste for risk, she
also disregards any form of strategic interaction within the game. The following two subsections describe
incorporating strategic interaction in the dynamic problem of a more sophisticated contestant.

The contestant’s decision problem with informative oﬀers

Let us now relax assumption A1 and consider:
A10 : Oﬀer m̃s follows a probability distribution fs (ms |hs , ki0 = ki ) , ki ∈ Ks ,
where the likelihood of the signal “oﬀer” is fs . We assume that the (dynamically optimizing) contestant
now takes into account that the monetary oﬀer ms received is correlated with the prize contained in the
box held at the time of the oﬀer. The probability distribution fs is assumed identical for all t and in the
empirical section we will approximate it with the empirical equilibrium play we actually observe in the data.
In addition we assume that:
A2 : Every contestant updates her priors by Bayes rule.
By Bayes rule it follows that the posterior probabilities assigned by the contestant to each remaining
prize are:

where pi (ms−1 ) indicates the prior held before the oﬀer ms is made19 , but after a new triplet of prizes has
dropped out20 . Note that both (8) and (3) depend on the path followed hs but that in general will diﬀer
under A10 and A2.
Under assumptions A10 and A2 the choice set of the contestant can be expanded in two dimensions.
First, it is now possible to incorporate in the model the behavior of the contestant when the oﬀer made is
a “change” and not only a monetary oﬀer. At s the probability πs of receiving a change instead of an oﬀer
is assumed independent of ki0 ∈ Ks and hs (condition that we verify in the data at every stage21 ). In a
change at stage s no signal is given, but the player can decide to swap boxes before continuing. The fact

that monetary oﬀers are uninformative under A1 and pi ∈ Ps are constant makes considering changes in the
decision problem (1) irrelevant (since each box has the same probability of containing each prize). However,

under A10 and A2 each pi is not constant and critically depends on the informativeness of the previous
monetary oﬀers (if any). If the probability assigned to holding a high prize in Ks is low, then by changing
the box held with another one the contestant increases the chances of ending up holding a higher prize.
Second, the decision of which box to open between stages can become relevant. Consider having accepted
a change at s and rejected an (informative) oﬀer ms−1 . Is it optimal to open the old box the contestant was

Remarks on the oﬀerer’s decision problem

Some important remarks are in order concerning the role of the “Infamous” within the behavioral framework
above.
First, by relying on the estimated equilibrium strategy of the oﬀerer, fs (.) for s = 1, ..., 5, it is possible
to abstract from modeling explicitly any component of the oﬀerer’s decisional problem in order to close the
model. There are two reasons why we follow this approach. The first is simplicity. The objective function of
the oﬀerer is multi-dimensional and this complicates its formalization substantially (for instance, it depends
on: the length of the episode, the amount disbursed relative to the show’s per-episode production budget,
the history of payments). Second, our approach seems appealing on the grounds that the multiplicity
of equilibria of the dynamic game between the informed oﬀerer (a long-run player) and the uninformed
contestant (a short-run player who observes the entire history of the show) could be resolved only under
relatively arbitrary refinements. Our solution is to rely on the data concerning which equilibrium is played.
In Appendix A we propose a simple framework to represent the interaction between the oﬀerer and the
contestant and we show that the optimal strategy of the Infamous depends on the assumption about the
behavior of the contestant. We assume that the oﬀerer is risk neutral and the contestant is risk averse. We
model the interaction as a reputation game with a series of short-run players (the contestants) observing the
behavior of the long-run player (the oﬀerer). We consider diﬀerent strategies where the Infamous varies the
oﬀer according to the content of the box in the contestant’s hands and we conclude that if the contestant
updates her beliefs about the content of the box held ki0 , the optimal strategy for the Infamous (the one that
minimizes the expected payout to the contestant) is to oﬀer a constant amount (the certainty equivalent of
the lottery). If the contestant were risk neutral then the oﬀerer’s expected payout to the contestant would
be equal to the expected value of the lottery, as the oﬀerer would be indiﬀerent between making an oﬀer
correlated with the content of the box held and making a constant oﬀer. Since the contestant is risk averse,
the least-cost strategy for the oﬀerer is to fully insure her and signalling the content of the box through the
oﬀer is suboptimal as it stands in the way of full insurance. We show that it is optimal for the oﬀerer to
make an oﬀer m that is positively correlated with the content of the box held by the contestant only when
the contestant does not optimally update her beliefs based on the oﬀer received, when she does not employ
(8). In that case making a relatively higher oﬀer guarantees acceptance on the part of the contestant and
saves the Infamous the high prize. Conversely, a low oﬀer is rejected and the low prize is paid. Although
we realize that the example in Appendix A postulates the total absence of Bayesian updating, we believe
imperfect Bayesian updating can justify the observed correlation between the oﬀer made and the prize held
by the contestant.
Employing the empirical likelihood of the oﬀer instead of a theoretical best response in the contestants’

12

<-----Page 12----->problem has clearly potential shortcomings. Particularly, it may act as a confounding factor in disentangling the relative role of rationality in the strategy played by the contestant and of risk preferences in the
estimation procedure. In order to address this issue we employ the following strategy. We begin by estimating a behavioral model for the contestant that relies exclusively on risk preferences and abstracts from
any strategic component: the static model assuming (7). We then add progressive layers of sophistication in
the contestant’s behavioral model (we estimate the uninformative and then the informative oﬀers dynamic
model) and observe the variation in the estimates. If estimates do not change substantially as the model
assumed for the contestant approximates a more sophisticated behavior, then it is possible to argue that
the estimates of risk preferences are not excessively sensitive to the behavioral assumption and the strategic
component does not appear to be first order.
A final remark relates to the computational implementation. Empirically the oﬀerer’s equilibrium strategy
appears to be independent on the parameterization of the individual preferences, that is m̃s is independent
of the individual characteristics of the contestant. While the behavioral framework above does not rely upon
this assumption in any fundamental way, it is worth noting that the estimation strategy turns out to lose
substantial computational burden. We will refer to this assumption in what follows as A3. A3’s empirical
content is validated in the reduced-form analysis available from the authors on request.

Estimation results

This section presents the estimation results for the model. Under the distributional assumption concerning
individual preferences, estimation by Maximum Likelihood is feasible. This allows us to estimate the conditional moments of the distribution from which the individual risk aversion parameters are drawn. Under
the normality assumption, the first two moments of the distribution of θ characterize the entire distribution.

4.1

CRRA parameterization

We begin by introducing a parametrization for the contestant t’s utility over wealth. Let ut (yt ) be constant
1−γ t

relative risk aversion, ut (yt ) = yt

/(1 − γ t ). Consistently with previous research22 , let us assume that the

initial reference point for t’s individual wealth yt is her annual labor income. We do not observe annual labor
income directly, but we are able to approximate it by matching the information concerning job and city of
provenience provided by the contestant during the game show with the Italian bureau of census relevant
sources. The relative risk aversion parameter follows γ t ∼ N (µt , σ t ) and in particular for observation t:

<-----Page 13----->where both xt and zt are vectors inclusive of individual and time covariates. The individual covariates we
are able to recover from the game show tapes are: gender, age, city and region of provenience, employment
characteristics (employed or not, type of job), household characteristics (married, divorced, or not married,
number of children, age and sex of children). We do not have access to any private information regarding
the contestants. The time covariates include date and broadcasting season of the show indicators.
At each stage s of each game t, it is possible calculate the continuation value of playing the game as a
function of the RRA parameter γ, given all possible future box openings, the empirical distribution of future
oﬀers as a function of expected value of the lottery, the optimal behavior at future oﬀers, the empirical
probability of change versus monetary oﬀers. The continuation value is a monotonic, decreasing, and convex
function of γ and therefore there exists a unique level of γ at which the contestant is indiﬀerent between
the oﬀer and continuing the game. If the contestant is more risk-averse than what the threshold implies
(i.e. the RRA parameter γ t falls above the threshold) she accepts the oﬀer. If the contestant is less riskaverse, i.e. the RRA parameter γ t falls below the threshold, the contestant rejects. This reasoning implies
that the acceptance/rejection behavior on the show imposes (stochastic) bounds on γ t : an upper bound
γ s,t,H in case of a rejection or a lower bound γ s,t,L in case of an acceptance. However, since accepting
an oﬀer is an absorbing state, there is at most one γ S̄,t,L , while there can be multiple γ s,t,H at diﬀerent s.
Under assumption A3 the process generating the stochastic bounds allows to partition the set of observations
into three groups: TR , individuals for which only rejections are observed; TA individuals for which only an
acceptance is observed; TAR , observations for which both rejections and an acceptance are observed. Under
this parameterization the log likelihood of the model (6) for the T game shows recorded can be rewritten as:

log L =

and where for computational feasibility we restrict our

attention only to the final 3 stages of the game .

The computation of the stochastic thresholds diﬀers between the uninformative and informative oﬀers
case. While the contestant employs constant probabilities in the former, she employs the equilibrium strategy
of the oﬀerer in the latter. We obtain the empirical signal (oﬀer) likelihoods from the data, for each stage
s > 2 and for each box held by the participant at stage s (relative to remaining boxes). We discretize
the support of the oﬀers in terms of percentages of expected value (due to data restrictions we allow for
2 3 Empirically

we observe always a change at s = 1 (with one exception, an oﬀer of irrelevant amount that was rejected). At

this stage such decision is always uninformative, as the player begins the game with flat priors (we verify empirically that actual
randomization of the boxes’ content is implemented). We exclude stage 2 from the analysis for two reasons. First m2 is always
a monetary oﬀer of irrelevant amount as the producers of the game try to avoid an excessively premature ending. Second, the
computational burden for this early stage is extremely intense. However we choose to employ the decisions at stage 2 in two
particular instances where substantial inconsistencies in the choice set were identified.

function of the box held by the contestant (three likelihood matrices, one for each stage). The informativeness
of the oﬀer also varies with the expected value of the lottery and empirically is the strongest for lotteries
with mean above 20, 000 euros. We therefore model the signal as uninformative below such amount. The
contestant thus performs Bayesian updating of her priors conditional on the oﬀer observed at every stage
and along all future lottery and possible oﬀer paths. The empirical likelihoods are reported in Table A3 in
the Appendix.
Finally, notice that the computation of the stochastic thresholds is the simplest in the static contestant’s
problem, that is an individual deciding on the basis of (7), as option values are disregarded.

4.2.1

CRRA results
Reduced-form calculations

To build intuition on the quantitative implications of our model we begin by briefly considering an extremely
reduced-form calculation. Table 2A reports the expected value of the initial lottery of Table 1A. It is 52, 560
euros. Suppose all the contestants do in this game show is to buy insurance. Then, given that they take home
an average final payoﬀ of 29, 436.09 euros, what is the CRRA parameter estimates such that this amount
is the exact certainty equivalent? For a representative contestant with annual labor income around 18, 000
euros (the mean of our sample24 ) it is γ = 0.53. The certainty equivalent for a γ = 1 contestant would be
instead lower, around 18, 000 euros. For a contestant employing as a reference point for wealth a ten percent
annuity of her future annual labor income (i.e. a lifetime wealth around 180, 000 euros) calculation shows
that γ = 1.62. A mean parameter of constant relative risk aversion around 1 is an estimate that concords
with the majority of the theoretical literature, see for instance the discussion in Weitzman (2005). This
result is also in accord with recent empirical calibrations derived from labor supply decisions such as those
reported in Chetty (2005). We will keep these back-of-the-envelope calculations in mind when discussing the
structural estimates below, as we would be wary of large discrepancies from these intuitive results.
Another coarse, but intuitive way to look at the data is to focus on the fifth stage of the game. All
the contestant does at this point is to choose between a monetary oﬀer m5 and a lottery consisting of two
prizes. Abstract from any sophistication in the updating of the subjective probabilities and assume that the
average contestant finds the two prizes with probability 1/2. What is the CRRA parameter that maximizes
the score of correctly predicted decisions in the observed sample? Table 2B indicates that out of the 78
episodes reaching s = 5 a parameter γ ∈ (1, 2) performs the best in matching actual decisions. Again a

quantity that seems reasonable. For the interested reader Table 2C reports a random sample of the actual
and predicted decisions (about 1/3 of the overall data available).
2 4 The

Purchasing Power Parity over GDP for Italy in 2000 as reported by the Penn World Tables (Mark 6.1) is 1, 709.11

Italian lira with and the lira/euro parity is 1936, 27. This implies a PPP adjusted average annual labor income of 18, 000 euros
to be equivalent to approximately 20, 392.40 US dollars.

Structural-form static results

Table 3A presents the maximum likelihood estimates of the risk preference distribution for the static model
(7). This is the simplest behavioral model for an individual decision-maker, as it relies exclusively on
risk preferences. We employ three diﬀerent specifications of the conditional density for unobserved taste
heterogeneity. In column (1) we begin by estimating a model where risk preferences γ t are normally i.i.d.
with mean µ and standard deviation σ, that is both x and z are assumed constant. The mean CRRA
parameter is estimated at 0.8834 with an asymptotic standard error of 0.0473 while the standard deviation
is estimated at 0.5341 with an asymptotic standard error of 0.0329. Both estimates are very precise and
indicate that a log utility approximates the mean preferences of our contestants quite well. Particularly, the
estimate for the mean accords to sensible theoretical predictions and to common perception in the literature.
At the same time we uncover substantial variation in taste heterogeneity for the population, a dimension
that has received little attention in the empirical research of choice under risk25 .
In column (2) we allow the conditional mean of the unobserved risk parameters to depend on a set
of observable characteristics of the individual, the contestant’s income level, and a set of time covariates.
Beginning with the set of individual covariates we are able to test if risk preferences diﬀer with respect to
a polynomial in age, gender, or region of provenience. We do not observe systematic diﬀerences in terms
of age, a result common to the majority of the literature. The F-test p-value for joint significance of the
age polynomial is however not very high: 0.11. More interestingly, we do not find female contestants to
present levels of constant relative risk aversion diﬀerent from male players. If anything, the opposite. Albeit
part of the literature seems to support the view of a gender diﬀerential in risk attitudes, results are either
mixed or not robust to alternative specifications (for instance in Cohen and Einav (2005)). A standard
asymptotic chi-square test also cannot reject a null joint eﬀects of regional dummies on the mean. A test on
the coeﬃcient of individual income cannot reject a null correlation between unobserved risk preferences and
income. This is a reassuring result, given the constant relative risk aversion assumption under which we are
operating.
Consider the coeﬃcients for the time trend (based on the date the show was broadcast) and the coeﬃcients on the seasonal indicators, as they have a specific interpretation in terms of the contestants’ selection
process26 . Arguably, the sample of contestants we employ is more representative of the general population
than samples of participants in laboratory experiments, but it is still necessary to produce a test of the
hypothesis that our sample is approximately representative of the overall population. Indeed, it would not
been unreasonable to argue that more risk-loving individuals could self-select on the game show. For this
purpose we rely on a shift in the selection process with which contestants were admitted to the show. The
show organizers indicated to us that the selection of the participants changed during the first season from
a process in which they would be inviting members of various cultural associations to one in which people
watching the show on TV would call and ask if they could participate. At that point in time, if significantly
2 5 An

exception in this respect are Cohen and Einav (2005). However their results are particularly puzzling, even with respect

to the mean of γ. Their estimates exceed eighty for the CRRA case.
2 6 Also see Section 2 for this point.

16

<-----Page 16----->more risk-loving individuals were beginning to self-select into the pool of participants, we should observe
a negative and significant trend in the levels of risk aversion of the contestants. This would imply a corresponding negative dynamic on the coeﬃcients of the seasonal indicators27 . This is not observed in the
data. The coeﬃcient on the time trend is positive (12.7240) and insignificant (s.e. 16.7935), while no clear
pattern is recognizable in the (jointly insignificant) seasonal dummies28 . Based on these tests we do not find
evidence of preferences-based selection in the data.
For column (2) calculation of the predicted mean of the model confirms the results from column (1)
(µ̂ = 0.8843), as does the estimated standard deviation of the distribution (still precisely estimated at 0.4633
with a s.e. of 0.0434).
In column (3) of Table 3A the model maintains the same specification for the conditional mean as column
(2) but now we allow for the conditional standard deviation of γ t to depend on observables. Previous results
for the mean of the RRA parameters are substantially confirmed. With respect to σ t the main finding is
a mild diﬀerence in the dispersion of risk preferences with respect to the trend. The trend variable has a
negative coeﬃcients, suggesting a reduction in the dispersion of preferences over time and is significant at
the five percent level. The lack of robustness of this result to further specification checks prevents us from
giving it a clearer interpretation. In general we conclude that, albeit substantial dispersion of preferences for
risk is present (the average predicted σ̂ t is 0.4161), no single individual covariate seems to account robustly
for dispersion in tastes.
4.2.3

Dynamic results and Bayesian updating of the contestant

Table 3B presents maximum likelihood structural estimates for the uninformative oﬀer dynamic model.
We follow the same outline of Table 3A. In column (1) the estimated mean of γ increases to 1.0879 with
asymptotic s.e. 0.1014. Although the parameter is precisely estimated, we cannot reject that it is significantly
diﬀerent from the static model. Thus, it accords with the intuitive reduced-form calculations we performed.
An estimated standard deviation of 1.07650 with s.e. 0.0523 is however larger relative to the mean than in
the static case. Table 3C presents maximum likelihood estimates under assumptions A10 and A2. Extending
the model in this direction allows to account for the informational content that we empirically observe in
monetary oﬀers. Similarly to column (1) of Table 2, in column (1) we assume the RRA parameters to be i.i.d.
The estimate of the mean of γ is 1.3688 with a s.e. of 0.1254 and the estimate for the standard deviation is
1.2800 (s.e. 0.0842). Again both estimates are significant, below the 1 percent critical level. In addition, µ̂
is larger and statistically diﬀerent from the estimate of Table 3B for the same specification.
Concerning columns (2) and (3), the estimates confirm the findings of Table 3A-3B both in the case
where the mean of γ t depends on observables and in the case where both mean and standard deviation do.
Again we reassuringly find neither systematic eﬀect of income on the mean, nor evidence of selection. In
fact, although the season dummies become significant in columns (2) and (3) for the mean, there is no clear
path of self-selection detectable. For instance, in Table 3C, column (2), the season 1 dummy presents an

(s.e. 0.3533).
Remark on testing for Bayesian updating. Even if monetary oﬀers are informative, it is not necessarily
the case that contestants employ Bayesian updating when deciding under risk. Is it possible to discriminate
from the data if it is the case? We have already observed how this is unfeasible in presence of monetary oﬀers
alone. However, under the assumption of informative oﬀers it is possible to test for Bayesian updating by
observing if box-changing behavior conforms to theory. If for any constant relative risk aversion parameter
contestants decide to change their box following informative oﬀers, this would suggests that indeed their
subjective probabilities have been updated incorporating such informational content.
A striking feature characterizes the data in this respect. Oﬀers preceding changes are generally uninformative. Conditional on a change at s0 > 2 the null fs (ms |hs , ki0 = ki ) = fs (ms |hs ) for the oﬀer likelihoods
cannot be rejected at any standard statistical levels. Our explanation is the following. Changes are random
for given history of the game, but for games that lose all large prizes at the onset changes become more
likely. Since oﬀers are uninformative at relatively low stakes, this makes Bayesian updating untestable along
this direction.
4.2.4

Lifetime wealth measures

In the empirical analysis up to this section we have employed average labor income as an approximation of
the individual’s wealth. We propose two alternative reference points in order to investigate the robustness
of our results.
First, we employ, as a measure of wealth, average labor income multiplied by a factor of 10. This is
reasonable if the individual discount rate is relatively low. For a given concave utility function, by increasing
the reference point we necessarily consider a range over which the utility function is relatively less concave.
Therefore, in order to explain the choices observed in the data, the utility function needs to be more concave
than the one we estimate for the case of a reference point equal to annual labor income. For the specific
case of the CRRA utility function this intuition is confirmed as we observe an estimate of γ around 3 for the
three models presented (static, uninformative oﬀer, informative oﬀer).
Second, we employ zero wealth as a reference point. Contrary to the previous case, we are now considering
a lower range of values over which a given function will be relatively more concave. Therefore, in order to
generate the observed set of choices, the degree of concavity must be lower than the case of annual labor
income as reference point. Indeed, the CRRA coeﬃcient γ is precisely estimated at around 0.5 for all three
models considered.
The main result in this section is that we obtain mean values of the CRRA parameters in a sensible,
lower single-digit range under diverse assumptions relative to wealth. Notice also that the log likelihoods in
columns (1) of Tables 3A-C are substantially higher than the ones reported in Table 4 for quite comparable
number of observations, favouring our initial choice of reference point29 .
2 9 The

diﬀerences in the number of observations are due to inconsistencies in the choice sets (discussed in the following section)

18

<-----Page 18----->4.3

Consistency of the choice set

The unobserved heterogeneity assumption under which we operate requires consistency in the choice set of
each individual, a condition that we now discuss. Table 5 reports the number of inconsistent thresholds
found in the analysis of the static, the uninformative, and the informative oﬀer model respectively. Each
behavioral model provides upper bounds, lower bounds, or both, for each episode of the game show. A
pair of inconsistent thresholds indicates an empty interval of RRA parameters, i.e. two choices by the same
contestant implying an upper bound for rejection lower than a lower bound for acceptance. Out of a total
252 episodes, the number of games in which we find inconsistencies is 11 for the static model, 8 for the
uninformative oﬀer model, and 15 for the informative oﬀer model. The number of inconsistent choices is
always smaller than 6 percent of the total number of registered choices over monetary oﬀers in the sample30 .
We can distinguish inconsistencies further, depending on the distance between the acceptance and the
rejection thresholds. Let us define a large inconsistency as an acceptance lower bound higher of more than
1 CRRA unit than the lowest rejection upper bound. Table 5 reports 4 large inconsistencies for the static
model (8 inconsistent thresholds), 4 for the uninformative oﬀer model, and 11 for the informative oﬀer model.
Hence, a substantial fraction of the inconsistencies are mild behavioral discrepancies.
There are two important implications of this result. First, the number of inconsistencies is suﬃciently
small to justify our modeling strategy based on unobserved heterogeneity. Random utility models could
incorporate easily the inconsistent observations by allowing for some random “error” in the execution of
the contestant’s decision, of which it would be possible to estimate the distribution. This would increase
the computational burden substantially however. By first solving for the stochastic bounds on the risk
preferences’ parameters and then estimating an interval regression model we avoid solving for the stochastic
bounds in the dynamic problem at every iteration of the ML estimator. Under unobserved heterogeneity and
assumption A3, MLE is consistent, asymptotically eﬃcient and asymptotically normal. Had the thresholdfinding routine embedded in the ML optimization, the CPU-time could become almost prohibitive (a single
iteration for the informative oﬀer model exceeds 12 CPU-hours on a fast microcomputer).
Second, the data do not seem to reject contestants being expected utility maximizers, quite the contrary
especially in the static and in the uninformative oﬀers model. Assuming that individuals decide based
exclusively on their marginal utility of wealth seems suﬃcient to explain observed behavior in a simple and
consistent matter. Expected utility is suﬃcient to provide a plausible representation of the individual choice
under risk without producing paradoxical behavior.
and the presence of 4 outliers, 1 in the static and 3 in the informative oﬀer model.
3 0 Even if compared to the number of episodes presenting both acceptance and rejections (across the various models we
register 86, 90, and 86 “interval” observations that are consistent, as reported in Tables 3A-C) such numbers are not large.
Notice however that the correct reference point is the total number of episodes, not the total number of “interval” episodes
since no restriction on the behavior of the contestant is imposed at the onset of the game.

A discussion of Rabin (2000)

A specific feature of this game show is its substantial variety in monetary payoﬀs, some of which are orders
of magnitude apart. Although every episode begins with the same set of prizes reported in Table 1A, the
stochastic evolution of the game produces wide diﬀerences in the set of lotteries each player faces later on
in the show. Some players see small prizes dropping out early in the game and end up facing extremely
attractive lotteries. Other contestants reach the final stages of the game facing lotteries consisting of trivial
amounts of money if compared to their lifetime wealth31 . We exploit such variation to investigate the
presence of substantial behavioral deviations from expected utility theory. The main result of this section is
that contestants on the show seem to behave as expected utility maximizers.
Rabin (2000)’s calibration theorem states that an expected utility maximizer who rejects a small actuarially favorable gamble for a wide range of initial wealth levels, will reject almost any large bet and therefore
exhibit an unrealistically high degree of risk aversion over large-stake gambles. This is because local concavity of the utility of wealth implies that marginal utility is decreasing at a paradoxically fast rate. The
theorem has three related consequences, that we address. The first implication is that a common underlying
concave utility of wealth cannot explain attitudes toward risk both over large gambles and small gambles.
The second implication is that, if we attempt to employ expected utility theory to explain such attitude, we
are bound to find higher levels of risk aversion at small stakes than at large stakes. The third implication
is that, in order for an expected utility maximizer to have a reasonable degree of risk aversion over large
gambles, she must be almost risk neutral over small gambles.
The first issue was addressed in the introduction where we showed that a logarithmic utility function
does a reasonably good job in explaining the acceptance and rejection pattern across diﬀerent gamble sizes.
In this section we address the second and the third implications of the calibration theorem and we find
that over small gambles the estimates of the coeﬃcient of risk aversion is smaller than over large gambles
and, more specifically, utility is almost linear at small stakes.
Table 6A-C report results concerning our basic i.i.d. specification for unobserved heterogeneity in risk
preferences in the CRRA case (i.e. the specification in column (1) of Tables 3A-C) at large and small
stakes. With “large-stakes” we indicate a decision made in the presence of a lottery implicating a substantial
departure from lifetime wealth. We consider to be a large-stake lottery one that includes at least one prize
in excess of 250, 000 euros (indicated as max option) or, alternatively, a lottery with mean payoﬀs of at least
75, 000 euros (mean option). Conversely, with “small-stakes” we indicate a decision made in the presence of a
lottery implicating at best a fairly modest departure from lifetime wealth. For instance a lottery including no
prize in excess of 25, 000 euros (min option) or, alternatively, a lottery with mean payoﬀs of at most 18, 000
euros (mean option). For each specific behavioral model we analyze (static, uninformative, and informative
oﬀer) we sample exclusively those decisions made under the specified definitions. Each table presents the
benchmark results of column (1) in Tables 3A-C (indicated as “All stakes”), and results in each of the four
subsamples.
3 1 Consider

however that 50 Euros (the minimum payment the contestant receives) is in the high range of payoﬀs oﬀered in

laboratory experimental settings.

20

<-----Page 20----->We report two results. First, the parameters of the distribution of γ can be estimated precisely by
employing decisions made at large stakes only and a constant relative risk aversion parameter of about
one captures the average of the sample population and its standard deviation precisely. Second, in all
specifications restricted the small-stake lotteries it is not possible to reject the null of risk neutrality at the
mean (µ = 0) at any standard confidence level. Notice that this second result confirms the well-known
proposition that expected-utility maximizing risk averse individuals should be locally risk neutral, which is
also at the basis of Rabin (2000) calibration theorem.
A reasonable criticism to the subsampling approach we follow is that large-stake lotteries are more likely
to appear earlier in the game while small-stake lotteries are typically limited to latter stages s = 4, 5. This
implies selection into continuation of the game, as more risk loving individuals are potentially more likely
to reach the final stages of the game. In order to address this issue we show the corresponding s = 4, 5
subsample results below each large-stake lottery. With the exception of the static model we in fact observe
mildly lower estimates of the mean. However, we can still reject risk neutrality at the 1 percent confidence
level32 for the large-stake lotteries.
Table 7 reports reduced-form results of small and large-stake lotteries similar to those of Table 2B for
s = 5. The aim here is no only to show what γ maximizes the score of correctly predicted choices in each
subsample, but the performance of risk neutrality, γ = 0, relative to such point. While risk neutrality
predicts correctly 19/32 of the small-stake lotteries vis-a-vis a 23/32 at γ = 1, risk neutrality fares much
worse in the large-stake case with a relative “score” of 9/25 vis-a-vis 21/25. This table oﬀers an intuitive
illustration of why we fail to reject risk neutrality at small stakes.
This set of empirical results contradicts a crucial point of departure in Rabin (2000) and Rabin and
Thaler (2001), but it is not completely unexpected. Palacios-Huerta, Serrano and Volij (2004) oﬀer several
intuitive illustrations of local risk neutrality. Metrick (1995) fails to reject risk neutrality in a relatively
small-stake game show (although with the caveats we report in the introduction).
Finally, let us briefly return to the small set of inconsistent choices described in the previous section.
We are interested in investigating whether such inconsistent behavior conforms to Rabin’s predictions. We
define a “Rabin’s observation” an individual characterized by the following decisions:
i. Rejection of an oﬀer when facing a large-stake lottery (determining a large-stake upper bound γ L
s,t,H );
ii. Acceptance of an oﬀer when facing a small-stake lottery (determining a small-stake lower bound γ Ss,t,L );
S
iii. The large-stake upper bound is lower than the small-stake lower bound γ L
s,t,H < γ s,t,L .

Among the 8 inconsistencies found in the previous section for the uninformative oﬀer case, we find 3
“Rabin’s observations”33 . Therefore the anomaly raised by Rabin seems to be relevant in 3 out of 43 (35
consistent small-stake, min option lotteries + 8 inconsistent ones) instances where individuals face first large3 2 Notice

also that sample sizes between the large and small-stakes lotteries become more comparable when restricting the

former to s = 4, 5.
3 3 An example of an observation of this type is given in Table 2C for the episode dated 3/12/2004.

arise.

Non-expected utility theories

In this section we incorporate a specific deviation from expected utility theory. Particularly, we assume that
contestants behave under risk according to Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), introduced by Tversky and
Kahneman (1992) as a subsequent modification of Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Diﬀerently from expected
utility theory, CPT postulates that individual behavior under risk depends on: i) the evaluation of gains
and losses, v(.), and not on the final wealth levels; ii) on the decision-weight function through which an
individual transforms the probabilities of a lottery into weights to be used in the decision, ϕ (.) mapping the
unit interval into itself34 . Specifically consider a static decision maker similar to the one illustrated by (7)
under expected utility. The stage-decision under CPT can be represented as:
"
#
X
1
ϕ (pi ) v(ki ) and pi =
ds = I v(ms ) >
n
(K
s)
i

(10)

where the summation is over the remaining prizes in Ks . On the onset we need to specify that, since the
game show does not present losses relative to the initial wealth level at which the participant begins the
game but only gains, our results are going to be silent with respect to loss aversion, a specific condition on
the asymmetry of the value function v(.) over losses and gains dominions of substantial interest35 . Let us
assume v(k) = k 1−γ /(1 − γ) for γ > 0 and γ 6= 1, and v(k) = ln k for γ = 1.

In this section we will concentrate on the probability weighting function ϕ (p) . In principle the same

asymmetry CPT postulates over the value function is also present in the weighting function, with diﬀerent
weighting functions for gains and losses. Again a direct test of such hypothesis is precluded by the data.
We focus instead on the fact that (10) nests (7) for the case of ϕ (.) linear and wealth level 0 (specifically
column 2 of Table 4 for the static model). The functional form we assume for the probability weights is a
power function, ϕ (p) = pα . This assumption is convenient as it produces an analytic indiﬀerence function
on the (γ, α) plane of the form:
!
Ã
X µ ki ¶1−γ
1
α = ln
,
ms
ln (n (Ks ))
i

(11)

where for points (γ, α) above the function there is acceptance and below rejection. The expression (11)
is derived by solving for α the condition in the indicator function of (10) at equality. We maintain the
assumption of unobserved heterogeneity as in (9), a condition that we now extend to:
3 4 Editing

rules for the decision weights and memory of the decisional process are also typical dimensions within the prospect

theory framework from which we abstract. See Thaler (1991) for a discussion. Our approach is similar in this respect to the
one followed by Jullien and Salanié (2000).

Table 8 reports the MLE for the static model incorporating decisions made according to (10) by individuals with preferences given by (12) for both an i.i.d. specification in which the conditional means of γ and
α are constant and a specification with conditional means depending on a set of covariates similar to those
employed in column (2) of Tables 3A-C (with the exclusion of regional and season of the show fixed eﬀects).
The estimate of the mean of γ in the i.i.d. specification is 0.6543 (s.e. 0.2022) while the standard deviation
of γ is 0.2421 (s.e. 0.1407). These estimates do not diﬀer statistically from column (2) of Table 4 nor of
Table 3A, given the relatively larger standard errors (all results remain significant however). The additional
parameters of interest are the mean of α, 0.9168 (s.e. 0.0595), and the standard deviation estimated at
0.0878 (s.e. 0.1042). The estimate of the covariance between the weighting function exponent α and γ is
−0.0087 (s.e. 0.0342). The null that the mean of α is equal to 1 cannot be rejected at standard confidence
levels tends to lend support to the claim that expected utility theory (which implies linear weights) does not

sensibly underperform CPT in this setting. The null that the standard deviation of α is equal to 0 cannot
be rejected at standard confidence levels tends to support the claim that no excessive dispersion in the α
is disregarded under EUT. Overall a similar picture arises from the second specification in which additional
individual covariances are considered.

Concluding remarks

The contribution of this paper to the empirical literature on decision making under risk stems from the novel
data set employed, where individuals face lotteries with payoﬀs in excess of half a million dollars. We are
not aware of any experimental settings where such payoﬀs are paid with non-infinitesimal probabilities. The
large variation in the stakes involved allows us to address two key issues.
First, we make use of the wide variation over final payoﬀs and estimate the degree of risk aversion of
contestants in the game show. We find the mean of the unobserved distribution of constant relative risk
aversion parameters to be precisely estimated slightly above one and therefore conclude that logarithmic
utility provides a suitable description of individual preferences. We also find substantial dispersion in risk
preferences, as we estimate the standard deviation of the RRA parameter to be around one.
Second, we address the concern, raised by Rabin (2000), that expected utility might not be suitable
to explain the diﬀerent behavior of individuals facing small and large-stakes gambles. As Palacios-Huerta,
Serrano and Volij (2004) point out, Rabin’s calibration theorem and therefore the prediction of unrealistic
levels of risk aversion over large-stake lotteries, relies on the rejection of small gambles for a wide range of
wealth levels. Similarly to the results reported by Palacios-Huerta, Serrano, and Volij (2004) we find that
23

<-----Page 23----->in a real-life experiment small gambles are accepted, indicating that a local estimate of the degree of risk
aversion for small-stakes lotteries reveals almost risk neutrality. Since Rabin himself suggested that “almost
risk-neutrality” over small gambles is the requirement for finding reasonable risk aversion levels at high stakes
we do not consider our findings in contrast with Rabin’s theorem. In fact, within the same experiment, we
are not able to reject risk neutrality at low stakes, yet our estimates start picking up some curvature in
the utility of income only when we move to larger lotteries. We believe this is an encouraging result as it
suggests that the risk attitudes towards small-stake and large-stake lotteries can be derived from the same
underlying utility of income.

Appendix A: Analysis of the oﬀerer’s behavior

In this appendix we lay out a simplified framework to interpret the game between the “Infamous” (the
oﬀerer) and the contestants on the game show “Aﬀari Tuoi”. We can see the “Infamous” as a long-run
player facing a series of short-run players, the contestants, which can observe the oﬀerer’s previous behavior.
We make the following assumptions about the Infamous objective function and behavior:
AA1 - The Infamous can commit to a given strategy
AA2 - The Infamous is risk neutral. The objective function of the Infamous is to minimize the expected
payout to the contestants.
We analyze the case s = 5 of the game where only two prizes are left and we take the two prizes to be 1
and 2 for simplicity. We assume that the Infamous knows the utility function of the contestants
u (x) =

x1−γ
1−γ

and for simplicity we take all contestants to be identical. Simplifying matters consider three types of strategies
the oﬀerer might choose:
• Strategy 1 : the Infamous oﬀers the same amount of money regardless of the amount held in the box
by the contestant.

• Strategy 2 : the Infamous makes two kinds of oﬀers, a high oﬀer and a low oﬀer. When the contestant

holds the high prize, the high oﬀer is made more often than the low oﬀer and the opposite happens

when the contestant holds the low prize. Both the high oﬀer and the low oﬀer are such that the
contestant always accepts them.
• Strategy 3 : the Infamous makes two kinds of oﬀers, a high oﬀer and a low oﬀer. When the contestant

holds the high prize, the high oﬀer is made more often than the low oﬀer and the opposite happens

when the contestant holds the low prize. The high oﬀer is such that the contestant always accepts it,
the low oﬀer is such that the contestant always rejects it.
Let k 0 ∈ {1, 2} be the prize held by the contestant in the closed box and m the oﬀer by the Infamous.

Let r be the payout of the Infamous to the contestant. Let θ be the state of the world, where θ = 1 is the

state of the world where the contestant holds the box with prize 1. The Infamous observes the state of the
world θ and the contestant does not. The payout is equal to the oﬀer m if the oﬀer is accepted and is equal
to k 0 if the oﬀer is not accepted. The three types of strategies and resulting equilibria that we analyze are
as follows.
Strategy 1 − The first type of equilibrium is one in which the Infamous always oﬀers m̄ and the contestant

accepts the oﬀer. The optimal oﬀer m̄ is the certainty equivalent of a lottery that assigns probability 1/2 to
the payoﬀ 1 and 1/2 to the payoﬀ 2.

payout for the Infamous, E1 (r) is m̄. Note that the oﬀerer this way avoids an equilibrium where the
contestants always refuses.
Strategy 2 − The second type of equilibrium is one in which the Infamous makes two types of oﬀers, a

high oﬀer mH and a low oﬀer mL according to the following likelihoods:
Pr (mH | θ = 1) = q
Pr (mL | θ = 1) = 1 − q
Pr (mH | θ = 2) = p
Pr (mL | θ = 2) = 1 − p

with p > q. We construct an equilibrium in which the contestant accepts both the high oﬀer mH and the
low oﬀer mL . The contestant accepts mH if:
u (mH ) ≥ Pr (1|mH ) u (1) + Pr (2|mH ) u (2)

(13)

u (mL ) ≥ Pr (1|mL ) u (1) + Pr (2|mL ) u (2)

(14)

and accepts mL :

where posterior probabilities are found using Bayes rule:
Pr (1|mH ) =
Pr (1|mL ) =

Pr (mH |1) Pr (1)
Pr (mH |1) Pr (1) + Pr (mH |2) Pr (2)
Pr (mL |1) Pr (1)
Pr (mL |1) Pr (1) + Pr (mL |2) Pr (2)

Priors are flat, that is Pr (1) = Pr (2) = 1/2 therefore Pr (1|mH ) = q/ (q + p) and Pr (1|mL ) = (1 − q) / (2 − q − p).

The lowest mH that the contestant will accept is found solving (13) with equality:
u (mH ) =

If we can find values of q and p for which E2 (r) < E1 (r) then the type of equilibrium under strategy 2 yields

Proposition 1 The expected payout to the contestant under Strategy 2 is always larger than or equal to the
payout under Strategy 1 : E2 (r) ≥ E1 (r) ∀ p, q, γ.

Proof. The result follows directly from convexity of the function f (x) = x 1−γ .
Strategy 3 − The third type of equilibrium is one in which the Infamous makes two types of oﬀers, a high

oﬀer mH and a low oﬀer mL according to the following likelihoods:
Pr (mH | θ = 1) = q
Pr (mL | θ = 1) = 1 − q
Pr (mH | θ = 2) = p

Pr (mL | θ = 2) = 1 − p
with p > q. We construct an equilibrium in which the contestant accepts the high oﬀer mH and rejects the
low oﬀer mL . The contestant accepts mH if:
u (mH ) ≥ Pr (1|mH ) u (1) + Pr (2|mH ) u (2)

(18)

u (mL ) ≤ Pr (1|mL ) u (1) + Pr (2|mL ) u (2)

and rejects mL :

where posterior probabilities are found using Bayes rule:
Pr (1|mH ) =

Pr (mH |1) Pr (1)
Pr (mH |1) Pr (1) + Pr (mH |2) Pr (2)

Priors are flat, that is Pr (1) = Pr (2) = 1/2 therefore Pr (1|mH ) = q/ (q + p) .We can set mL low enough
that the participant will always reject it. This does not aﬀect the payoﬀ of the Infamous, as in equilibrium
this oﬀer is rejected. The lowest mH that the contestant will accept is found solving (18) with equality:

According to Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 the Infamous’ optimal strategy to minimize the payout to

the contestant is to make a constant oﬀer, irrespective of the content of the box held by the contestant.
Assume now that the rationality of the contestant is violated in a specific way, that is the contestant
does not update her priors on the prize held according to Bayes rule. Consider the following strategy:
Strategy 4 - The Infamous oﬀers m̄ when the θ = 2 and oﬀers mL < m̄ when θ = 1.
In the absence of updating the contestant will accept oﬀer m̄ and reject mL . The expected payout under
strategy 4 is:
E4 (r) =

Proposition 3 If the contestant does not update her priors according to Bayes rule, then the expected payout
to the contestant is lower under strategy 4 than under strategy 1: E4 (r) < E1 (r).
Proof. Since m̄ > 1 the result follows immediately.

Appendix B: Value functions

Uninformative oﬀers
Consider first how the value function for the case with uninformative monetary oﬀers (1) needs to
be modified when we incorporate box changes in the contestant’s problem. By introducing an exogenous
probability π s+1 of a change being oﬀered at s + 1 we can rewrite (1) as:
Vs (Ps , Ks , ms )
⎫

where expectations are taken conditionally to Ωs , Ks , Ps . Notice that since under A1 the contestant’s priors
are always flat, a "change" amounts to a stage where no decision is possible36 . Hence, the value function for
a change at s, indicated by Cs (Ps , Ks ), can be written as:
3 6 Changes

may happen even in the presence of unfinformative oﬀers for idiosyncratic reasons, such as personal taste or

superstition. They are however features that would require a substantial and not straightforward extension of the behavioral
model. We disregard them in the present setting

Informative oﬀers
We now derive the value functions for the problem with informative oﬀers, starting from the value of a
monetary oﬀer at s. The value function of a monetary oﬀer ms is the maximal:

where expectations are now taken conditional to Ωs , Ks , Ps (ms ) , Zs . Note the introduction of the state
variable Zs , which we now define. The continuation values and path choices are slightly less straightforward
in the case of informative oﬀers. To see why, just note that the decision whether to open a box previously
in the contestant’s hands or another box that was not in her hands has to be taken into account when
computing the set of possible continuation paths. The probability of ending on a specific path becomes a
choice variable. The variable Zs is defined as:

and indicates the presence of (the first) change of boxes performed after an informative oﬀer had been
previously made. Z indicates if in the set of boxes not held by the contestant there is a box she previously
hold in her hands after having received at least one informative oﬀer. In a setting where s ≤ 5 and under

the assumption that monetary oﬀers before stage 3 are always uninformative, Z4 = 1 if there is a monetary
oﬀer at 3 and a change of boxes at 437 .

Appendix C: Variables description

Age = age of the participant (in years). The age that the individual declares during the game show. If
no indication of age is directly given, the individual is assigned to an age bracket. Approximating from
the appearance of the player we assign him or her to a more precise bracket (20-25, 25-30, 30—35, ...) or
to a wider bracket (20-30, 25-35, 30-40, ...) solely on the basis of appearance. The corresponding age is
the mid-point of the range. This procedure was necessary in the majority of cases (209 out of 254). This
approximation procedure was required by the fact that we were not allowed to access the personal files of
the players (some of the following covariates present similar instances at times).
Employed = discrete variable taking value 1 if the participant is currently employed, value -1 if the
participant is unemployed, value 0 if the participant is out of the labor force (retired, student...). The job
and employment status the individual declares during the game show is recorded for 217 participants. For
each participant for which a job is recorded we define four dummy variables: Agriculture, Manufacturing,
Construction, and Services, that take value equal to 1 if the participant is employed in any of the four sectors,
0 otherwise.
32

<-----Page 32----->Female = dummy variable taking value 1 if the participant is female, 0 otherwise.
Income = income of the participant (in Euros). In order to assign an income level to a participant we
employ two sources of information: the type of job he or she declares on the show (available for 217 out of
254 episodes) and the city/province/region of residence (region is always available and the city/province is
available for 224 shows). We match the individual to the national annual labor income by type of job and
then adjust for the province value added relative to the national average to proxy for local average level
of income. Source of both data sets is the Italian national bureau of statistics (ISTAT). For annual labor
income we employ "Tavola 4.12 ISTAT (Lavoro e Reddito)" which includes national labor income by type
of job (measured in Italian Lire and averaged between white and blue collar within type of job) in 2001.
The data are then converted in Euros using the exchange rate for the EU parity. We use value added data
broken down by province in 2001 (measured in Euros) from Table "Tavola ISTAT - CONTI PROVINCIALI
2004 Valore Aggiunto per Unita’ di Lavoro". We correct for inflation from 2001 to 2004 (2001-2 = 2.5%;
2002-3 = 2.7%; 2003-4 = 2.2%) employing "Tabella 6. Indice generale nazionale dei prezzi al consumo per
l’intera collettività, NIC". For individuals with only regional provenience available we employ the average
annual income in the region.
Marital status = single, married or divorced. The status that the individual declares during the game
show. It is available for 217 participants.
Not-main-city = dummy variable taking value 1 if the participant resides in the main city of his or
her province, 0 otherwise. The city is the individual declares during the game show is recorded for 227
participants.
Number of children = number of children of the participant as declared during the game show. Sex and
age of children are also sometimes available although for a smaller portion of the sample. Number of children
is available for 203 participants.
Region = set of 20 dummy variables for the region of which the participant is resident.. There are some
rare cases in which the player represents the region of birth, but currently resides in another region. The
list of regions in the North is: Valle D’Aosta, Piemonte, Liguria, Lombardia, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia,
Trentino-Alto Adige, Emilia-Romagna; in the Center: Toscana, Marche, Lazio, Umbria, Abruzzo, Molise; in
the South: Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicilia, Sardegna.
Season = set of 6 dummy variables for the show season during which the show was aired. The first season
was broadcast during the fall of 2003.
Trend = time trend in number of days. 0 corresponds to 01 January 1960. Date employed for computing
the trend is the date the show was aired on television, not the day it was actually recorded. The day of the
recording was not available in the tapes.

Note: The distributional assumption is that the unobserved γ is N(µ,σ). OPG asymptotic standard errors in

model required the exclusion of 3 influential observations. The differences in the number of observations across
the different models are due to inconsistent observations, see text for a discussion.

Note: Payoff amounts are reported in Euros. The choice set includes decisions on monetary
offers only at stages s > 2 . The total number of stages is 756 (=252 episodes*3 stages). Missing
and changes amount to 224 (see Table A1 in Appendix). Of the remaining 532 monetary offers,
13 were made at s = 5 with 2 prizes of identical value and are dropped , leaving 519 choices.
The threshold-finding routine did not converge in 1 (resp. 2) occasion for the static and
uninformative (resp. informative) offers model producing the totals in the last column. Only
observations that present inconsistent behavior are dropped. The number of inconsistent
episodes is the number of inconsistent choices divided by 2.

(max option); 2) a lottery with mean payoffs of at least 75,000 Euros (mean option). We define 'Small stakes' : 1)
a lottery including no prize in excess of 25,000 Euros (min option); 2) a lottery with mean payoffs of at most
18,000 Euros (mean option). Stage 4,5 indicates that the sample is restricted to those stages.

Note: The table presents the stage likelihoods of the various offers conditional on the rank of the box held by the
contestants. Higher rank means higher prize. The expressions in Italics mean that we spread part of the likelihood over the
missing events cells in order to avoid dealing with zero-probability events (indicated in the boxes). This solution does not
seem to affect our results. A three-way split of the offers range was also tried and the likelihoods are available from the
authors. In expectation the mid-point of the offer relative to the expected values of the lottery is taken. The likelihood
above is obtained from the full set of offers to maximize the number of cells but employed only for E(lottery)>20,000
Euros.
