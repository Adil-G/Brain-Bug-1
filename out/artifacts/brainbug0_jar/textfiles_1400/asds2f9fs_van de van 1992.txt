SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDYING STRATEGY 

PROCESS: A RESEARCH NOTE 

ANDREW H. VAN DE VEN 

Curtis L. Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 

Minnesota, U.S.A. 


This paper makes three suggestions to researchers for studying strategy process. First, define
the meaning of process. Process is often used in three ways in the literature: ( I ) a logic
used to explain a causal relationship in a variance theory, (2) a category of concepts that
refer to actions of individuals or organizations, and (3) a sequence of events that describe
how things change over time. The second suggestion is to clarify the theory of process. A n
interdisciplinary literature review identifies four types of theories of process that can be
drawn upon: life cycle, teleology, dialectics, and evolution. The third suggestion is to design
research to observe strategy process in such a way that is consistent with one's definition
and theory of process.

There is growing scholarly interest in strategy
process research, which is concerned with understanding how organizational strategies are formulated and implemented and the processes of
strategic change (Chakravarthy and Doz, this
issue). As this special issue of SMJ indicates, the
body of strategy process research is diverse and
cannot be contained within a single paradigm.
Implicitly, scholars tend to adopt very different
views of strategy process, and the views they
adopt influence the questions they ask, the
research methods they employ, and the contributions they make. It is useful to make these
different views explicit. Doing so can help
individual scholars better understand the conceptual basis of their research, can facilitate communications between scholars pursuing different
views of strategy, and collectively can help us all
better understand promising directions and dead
ends in strategy process research. With these
objectives in mind, this paper makes three

interrelated suggestions for studying strategy
process.
1. Define the meaning of process.
2. Clarify the theory of process.
3. Design research to observe process.

DEFINE THE MEANING OF PROCESS
A cursory review of the numerous 'process
models' that have been proposed in strategic
management literature indicates that the term
'process' is used in many different ways. My first
suggestion for studying strategy process is to
reduce confusion in the literature by distinguishing between the different usages of this
term. In particular, three meanings of process
are often used: (1) a logic that explains a causal
relationship between independent and dependent
variables, (2) a category of concepts or variables
that refers to actions of individuals or organizations, and (3) a sequence of events that describes
how things change over time.

A. H. Van de Ven

Process as explanation for variance theory
In terms of an input-process-output model, the
first definition uses a process logic to explain a
causal relationship between observed inputs
(independent
variables)
and
outcomes
(dependent variables) in a variance theory (Mohr,
1982). In this usage, process is not directly
observed. Instead, a process story or logic is
used to explain why an independent (input)
variable exerts a causal influence on a dependent
(outcome) variable. For example, to explain
why an increase in organization size increases
structural differentiation at decreasing rates, Blau
and Schoenherr (1971) invoke a process story
which describes the sequence of events in which
labor is progressively divided as additional
personnel are hired with different skills in an
organization.
In general, process explanations are commonly
used to explain causation between independent
and dependent variables. But, as Van de Ven and
Huber (1990) discuss, such process explanations
typicaliy entail highly restrictive and unrealistic
assumptions about the order and sequence
in which events unfold in organizations. One
significant way to improve the robustness of
process explanations in variance theories is to
explicitly observe the process argument that is
assumed to explain why an independent variable
causes a dependent variable. To do so requires
opening the proverbial 'black box' between inputs
and outcomes, and to directly observe process.
Process as category of concepts
The second and most frequently used meaning
of process is as a category of concepts of
individual and organizational actions, such as
communication frequency, work flows, decision
making techniques, as well as strategy formulation, implementation, and corporate venturing.
In this usage, process refers to a category
of concepts that is distinguished from other
categories of concepts, such as organizational
environment, structure, and performance. And,
like these other categories, process concepts are
operationalized as constructs, and measured as
fixed entities (variables), the attributes of which
can vary along numerical scales from low to high.
For example, Priem (this issue) examines how
strategy making processes influence executive

understanding of cause-effect relationships
involving the firm and its environment. Strategy
making processes, such as scanning, analysis, and
planning conceptually imply that a sequence of
activities or events goes on to help make decisions
about the firm's alignment with its environment.
However, activities in scanning, analysis, and
planning are not directly examined (as they are
in the third definition of process, below). Instead,
these process constructs are operationalized as
variables which, as Abbott (1988) argues, transform the constructs into attributes of fixed entities
that interact, in causal or actual time, to create
outcomes, themselves measurable as attributes
of the fixed entities. The variable attributes have
only one causal meaning (one pattern of effects)
in a given study. As a consequence, when
process constructs are represented into this
entitieslattributes model of reality, one can only
measure if, not how, a change occurred in a
variable measured at different points in time. To
understand how a change occurred requires a
story that narrates the sequence of events that
unfolds as a strategy changes over time.
Process as developmental event sequence
The third, and least understood, meaning of
process is a sequence of events or activities that
describes how things change over time, or that
represents an underlying pattern of cognitive
transitions by an entity in dealing with an
issue.' Whereas the second definition of process
examines changes in variables over time, the
third definition of process takes an historical
developmental perspective, and focuses on the
sequences of incidents, activities, and stages that
unfold over the duration of a central subject's
existence. Table 1 exemplifies this third meaning
of process by outlining a sample of well-known
developmental process models pertaining to
strategic decision making (Mintzberg, Raisinghani, and Theoret, 1976; Cohen, March and
Olsen, 1972; Quinn, 1980), strategic planning
(Gluck, Kaufman, and Walleck, 1980; Lorange,

I Some developmental process models, such as Huff's (1990)
maps of strategic thought, are concerned with underlying
processes of unspoken cognitive choices, emotions or motivations, which are not directly observable. T o study them
inferences must be drawn by diagnosing patterns in observable
activities, events, or behaviors over time of the subject.

1980), and organization development (Scott,
1971; Greiner, 1972).
While these three sets of process models are
concerned with the development of very different
things, they are strikingly similar in two respects,
and different in another. First, with the exception
of Cohen et al's. (1972) garbage can model of
choice, all the other process models were
developed inductively based on cross-sectional
observations or retrospective case histories in a
variety of companies. The stages or phases of
activities in each model were inferred either from
company historical self-reports or by categorizing
cohorts of companies into the stages or phases.
In no instance was any one company or organizational unit actually observed to go through all
the stages or phases of a model over time. Thus,
as discussed in the third section, there is a great
need for systematic longitudinal research to
substantiate and elaborate these process models
of development.
Second, in contrast with the variable entities1
attributes model used in the second meaning of
process, no variables are reflected in the process
models in Table 1. Instead, the central focus of
developmental process models is on progressions
(i.e. the nature, sequence and order) of activities
or events that an organizational entity undergoes
as it changes over time. As Table 1 exemplifies,
the most common form of progression in the
strategy literature is a linear sequence of stages or
phases of development. For example, a rational
process of decision making is typically viewed
as a sequence of separable stages (e.g. need
recognition, search, screen, and choice activities)
ordered in time and with transition routines to
make adjustments between stages (March and
Simon, 1958). As Poole and Roth (1989) demonstrated, when researchers use a priori stages or
phases to design their research and collect data,
their results can easily become self-fulfilling prophesies. The linear sequential model of development
is typically inadequate to deal with the complexities
of many strategy ventures because it assumes
invariance between and within all organizational
units in following a prescribed order of developmental phases; one locked after another.
There are many other forms of progression
that are useful for thinking about and observing
developmental processes. The child development
psychologists, van den Daele (1969; 1974) and
Flavell (1972) for example, propose a typology

of developmental progressions that goes beyond
simple unitary stages and includes multiple,
cumulative, conjunctive, and iterative progressions of convergent, parallel, and divergent
streams of activities that may unfold as a
strategy develops over time. While many strategic
management scholars may not be familiar with
this vocabulary, it is useful for appreciating
alternative forms of developmental progressions,
which in turn, is central to understanding
the third meaning of process. Moreover, this
vocabulary provides the analytical terms needed
to make clear distinctions between the various
models of strategy development in Table 1.
Based on mathematical set theory, van den
Daele (1969; 1974) and Flavell (1972) introduce
the following progressions2 that may describe
temporal patterns in sequences of events.

Unitary progression
This is a sequence of the form: U +V +W,
where U, V, and W represent qualitatively different
patterns, stages, or phases of activities or behaviors.
This model assumes that each stage may consist
of any number of subsets of activities, but that
these subsets must occur in an ordered progression.
If a developmental progression has no more than
one subset of events over time, it is called a simple
unitary progression, as illustrated in Table 1 by
the two strategic planning models and Scott's
(1971) stage model of corporate development.

Multiple progressions
This model assumes that developmental processes
can follow more than a single possible path.
Three common forms of multiple progressions
among event sequences are the following parallel,
divergent, and convergent progressions.
In multiple progressions a temporal sequence
of events may reflect more than one pathway at
a given time in the ordered progression. For

'

Riegel (1969) considered four formal models that parallel
van den Daele's. He outlined mathematical formulations for:
(1) branching processes, in which elements successively
differentiate; (2) root models, based on progressive combination of positions; (3) jigsaw models, which show how
patterns emerge from a given set of pieces; and (4) fallout
models, which illustrate progressive acquisitions of parts from
a predetermined store. Such formal treatments may offer
useful distinctions among event progressions in future work.

example, in the strategic decision process study
of Mintzberg et al. (1976) in Table 1 more
than one feasible path (or routine) of decision
diagnosis, search, or evaluation might be pursued
in each respective stage of identification, development and selection. These paths diverge from
each other at the beginning of each stage, proceed
in parallel progressions during each stage, and
converge at the end to complete each stage.
As this example suggests, any developmental
progression that has more than one subset of
parallel paths at a time is called a multiple
progression. A description of how multiple
progressions of events diverge, proceed in parallel, or converge over time provides a useful
vocabulary for making process statements about
specific stages or the overall developmental
pattern of a developing entity over time.

Cumulative progression (in unitary or multiple
models)
This model assumes that more than one stage
may belong to a unit at a time. In set theory
terms: U > a, V > ab, W 3 abc (unitary model).
For example, a multiple, parallel, partiallycumulative model could look like this.

If events are cumulative, (as they are assumed
to be in Scott's (1971) and Lorange's (1980)
models in Table 1) then elements found in earlier
events or stages are added to and built upon in
subsequent events or stages. Complete cumulation means that every event from each stage is
carried from its onset until the end of- the
developmental progression. This of course seldom
happens, since losses of memory, mistakes and

173

CONVERGENT

detours, and terminated pathways all imply
partially cumulative or substitution progressions
(as illustrated in the bottom two tracks above).
Such partial cumulation is reflected in Quinn's
(1980) 'logical incremental' model of a long
sequence of 14 stages, and clearly distinguishes
it from the rational model of decision making.
A cumulative progression may take the form
of addition, substitution, or modification (Flavell,
1972). In addition, a later-occurring event supplements an earlier-occurring event. The outcomes of two events E , and E2 may coexist and
are both equally available for E,. For example,
in Scott's (1971) model of corporate development,
a multiple products divisionalized structure is
largely produced by the addition (with slight
modification) of a stage 1 single product entrepreneurial structure with a stage 2 single product
functional structure. With substitution the outcomes
of a later event largely replace those of an earlier
one. More precisely, E2 deletes or subtracts the
effects of E l , and replaces them by adding those
of E2. For example, in Greiner's (1972) model of
organizational growth, crisis at the end of each
stage leads the organization to shift (or substitute)
its focus and transition into the next qualitatively
new stage. In modiJication a later event represents
'a differentiation, generalization, or more stable
version of the earlier one' (Flavell, 1972: 345). In
this case the outcome of E l is revised or modified
in E2. For example, in the strategic planning model
of Gluck (1980) the planning process and focus of
each prior stage is modified and made more
elaborate in the next stage.

Conjunctive progressions (in unitary, multiple,
or cumulative models)
Conjunctive progressions posit that the elements
of subsets may be related, such that aR.b, or
aR1b. Conjunctive events are causally related

<-----Page 6----->174

A. H. V a n de Ven 


events, meaning that events in one pathway may
influence events in other pathways of a multiple
progression. Of course what is related at one
time may be viewed as unrelated at another.
Therefore, strict causality among events is difficult
to establish.
Conjunctive progressions may be probabilistic,
inclusive, or mediated. Probabilistic relationships
between events occur when the trajectories of
multiple paths of activities happen to intersect.
Such is the form of conjunction among streams
of choices, problems, solutions, and participants'
energy in the garbage can model of Cohen et al.
(1972). Inclusion occurs when the outcomes of
earlier events become incorporated into the later
one, as often observed with PERT charts. In this
case E l , and E,, are logically integrated or
converge to yield E,. For example, Lorange's
strategic programing phase represents the logical
inclusion of alternatives from stage 1 into a
strategic program in stage 2. In a mediation
relationship an earlier event or element 'represents some sort of developmental bridge or
stepping stone (mediator) to the later one'
(Flavell, 1972: 345). So E, is required in order
to move from E , to E3, which may also preempt alternative paths. For example, in Greiner's
model crisis events mediate and bridge transitions
between evolutionary stages of organizational
growth.

Recurrent progressions (in unitary, multiple,
cumulative, or conjunctive models)
These are repeating strings of events or activities
over time. Although the previous progression
models have been treated as nonrecurrent
sequences, parts or all of them may repeat over
time. For example, what distinguishes Mintzberg's
model of strategic unstructured decision processes
from the others in Table 1 is its attention to
repeating routines, or iterative progressions,
within each phase of decision making. Abbott
(1990) discusses a variety of techniques for the
colligation and measurement of recurrent and
nonrecurrent event sequence data.
As our examples in Table 1 indicate, these
alternative models of progression do not occur
independently. Every development process model
makts a commitment (implicitly or explicitly) to
some form of invariant sequential order, between
unit variation (unitary or multiple sequence),

within-unit variance (simple or cumulative
structure), in the relationship of developmental
elements (conjunctive or disjunctive), and
whether event sequences reoccur or net. This
vocabulary of temporal relationships among
events can help scholars articulate the meanings
of their process models in more operational and
discriminating ways than has been the case in
the past. However, as we will now discuss, this
analysis of process as a sequence of events cannot
go far without considering the alternative theories
of process that may explain specific developmental progressions.

CLARIFY THE THEORY OF PROCESS
Whereas a definition of process indicates one's
meaning of process in relation to other uses in
the literature, a theory of process consists of
statements that explain how and why a process
unfolds over time. Such a theory is needed not
only to ground the conceptual basis of a process
study on strategy formulation, implementation,
or some other substantive topic, but also to guide
the design and conduct of empirical research.
Thus, the second basic suggestion for studying
strategy process is to clarify the theory of process
underlying the substantive investigation.
Adopting the third meaning of process, Scott
Poole and I conducted a literature review of the
theories available to explain the process of
development, defined as the sequence of change
events that unfolds over the duration of an
entity's existence-its formulation, implementation, growth, adaptation, and termination (Van
de Ven and Poole, 1991). A selected set of
keywords was used to conduct a computerized
search of the literary data bases in various
disciplines. Table 2 shows the number of times
that the selected keywords appeared in the titles
or abstracts of articles in the data bases."
Using factors of 10 to reduce complexity, we
reviewed about 200,000 titles, perused about
20,000 abstracts, which lead us to read 2,000
papers, about 200 of which were found useful to
identify about 20 different theories of development or change, which in turn, can be classified
.' It is incredible that we know so little about development
and change processes after a half-million articles have been
written about this subject in various disciplines!

life cycle. For example, firms may choose not to
engage in legislation or biomedical product
development; but if they do they have no recourse
but to follow the institutionally required sequence
of steps.
Teleology process theory

Another commonly understood family of process
theories is teleology, which underlies many
theories of administrative behavior, including:
functionalism (Merton, 1968), decision making
(March and Simon, 1958); epigenesis (Etzioni,
1963), enactment (Weick, 1979), voluntarism
(Parsons, 1951), adaptive learning (March and
Olsen, 1976), and most models of strategic
planning and goal setting (Chakravarthy and
Lorange, 1991). A teleology process theory is
based on the assumption that the developing
entity is purposeful and adaptive; by itself or in
interaction with others. It socially contructs an
envisioned end state and selects from alternatives
a course of action to reach it.
Unlike life cycle theory, teleology does not
presume a necessary sequence of events, yet it
does imply standards by which change can be
judged. There is no prefigured rule or logically
necessary direction to a teleological process.
However, we are still able to assess when an
entity is developing; it is growing more complex,
or it is growing more integrated, or it is filling
out a necessary set of functions. We are able
to make this assessment, because teleological
theories posit a standard of what an envisioned
end state for an entity is and we are able to
observe movement toward the end state.
This explanation draws on classical functional
theory, which explains development in terms of
movement toward some final goal or state of
'rest' (however temporary). This goal can be
achieved via a number of paths, all tending
toward the same endpoint. Teleological models
of development incorporate the systems theory
assumption of equifinality; there are several
equally effective ways to achieve a given goal.
There is no assumption about historical necessity.
Rather, these models rely on voluntarism as the
explanatory principle: they posit a set of functions

or goals desired by an organizational unit, which
it has to acquire in order to 'realize' its aspirations.
Development is movement toward attaining a
purpose, goal, function, or desired end state.
That an entity attains this end state does
not mean it stays in permanent equilibrium.
Influences in the external environment or within
the entity itself may create instabilities that push
it to a new developmental path or trajectory.
Theories that rely on a teleological process cannot
specify what trajectory development will follow.
They can at best list a set of possible paths, and
rely on norms of rationality to prescribe certain
paths.

Dialectic process theory

A third family of process theories, dialectics,
begins with the assumption that the developing
entity exists in a pluralistic world of colliding
events, forces, or contradictory values which
compete with each other for domination and
control. These oppositions may be internal to
the entity because it may be prefigured with
contradictory laws or rules of development (i.e.
incompatible life cycle programs), or it has
multiple conflicting goals or teleologies. Oppositions may also arise external to the entity as it
pursues developmental paths that collide with
those of others. For example, Riegel (1975)
proposes a dialectical theory of human development in which change in adults is brought
about by contradictions within or between four
interacting progressions of life events: inner
biological, individual-psychological, culturalsociological, and outer-physical forces. So also,
Greiner (1972) proposes that tensions between
revolutionary and evolutionary forces propel
organizational growth through each stage of
development shown in Table 1.
Stability and change with a dialectical process
theory are explained by the relative balance of
power between opposing forces. Stability is
produced through partisan struggles and accommodations which maintain the status quo between
oppositions. Change occurs when these opposing
values, forces, or events go out of balance. The
relative strength, power, or legitimacy of an
antithesis may emerge or mobilize to a sufficient
degree of force to overthrow the current thesis
or state of affairs and produce a synthesis, which

<-----Page 11----->Strategy Process Suggestions
then becomes the new thesis as the dialectical
process recycles and continues.
More specifically, a process theory that focuses
on the intercourse of opposites can explain
organizational changes that move toward: (1)
equilibrium, (2) oscillation, and (3) chaos. First,
organizational stability and inertia result when
the routines, goals, or values of the status quo
are sufficiently dominant to suppress opposing
minority positions, and thereby produce
incremental adaptations flowing toward equilibrium. Such movements to equilibrium underlie
exchange theories of conflict (Blau, 1964), models
of organizational power (Pfeffer, 1981; Astley
and Zajac, 1991), and planned organizational
change (French and Bell, 1978). Second, organizational business cycles, technological regimes,
and political contests occur when opposing forces
alternate and push the organization somewhat
farther from an equilibrium orbit. Such recurrent
cycles are exemplified in models of vicious circles
in organizations (Masuch, 1985), partisan mutual
adjustment (Lindblom, 1965; Quinn, 1980), and
creative destruction (Schumpeter, 1942). Third,
organizational transformations and anomie are
produced when strong oscillations occur between
opposing forces that push the organization out of
its equilibrium orbit and produce deconstructions
(Martin, 1990), bifurcations (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984), and catastrophes (Zeeman, 1976)
leading to chaos. Thus, different patterns for
resolving dialectical oppositions can push an
organization to flow toward equilibrium, to
oscillate in cycles between opposites, or to
bifurcate far from equilibrium and spontaneously
create revolutionary changes.

Evolution process theory
Although evolution is sometimes equated with
change, as a specific family of process theories
we use evolution in a more restrictive sense to
focus on cumulative changes in structural forms
of populations of organizational entities across
communities, industries, or society at large
(Campbell, 1969; Hannan and Freeman, 1977;
Aldrich, 1979). As in biological evolution, change
proceeds in a continuous process of variation,
selection, and retention. Variations, the creation
of novel forms are often viewed to emerge by
random chance; they just happen (Aldrich,
1979). Selection occurs principally through the

179

competition among forms, and the environment
selects those forms which optimize or are best
suited to the resource base of an environmental
niche (Hannan and Freeman, 1977: 939). Retention involves the forces (including inertia and
persistence) that perpetuate and maintain certain
organizational forms. Retention serves to counteract the self-reinforcing loop between variations
and selection. Weick (1979) and Pfeffer (1982)
note that while variations stimulate the selection
of new organizational forms, retention works to
maintain those forms and practices that were
selected in the past. Thus, evolution explains
change as a recurrent, cumulative, and probabilistic progression of variation, selection, and retention.
In organization and management applications,
evolutionary theory is often used to depict
global changes in organizational populations (e.g.
Carroll and Hannan, 1989), although Burgelman
(1991) and Singh (1990) have adopted the
evolutionary model to explain processes of
strategy making within organizations, and Weick
(1979) and Gersick (1990) have applied evolution
at an even more micro level to explain
social-psychological processes of organizing.
Alternative theories of social evolution can be
distinguished in terms of how traits can be
inherited, whether change proceeds gradually
and incrementally or rapidly and radically,
and whether the unit of analysis focuses on
populations of organisms or species. Social
Darwinists (such as Hannan and Freeman, 1977;
1989; McKelvey, 1982; Nelson and Winter, 1982)
argue that traits can be inherited only through
intergenerational processes, whereas Lamarkian
and cultural evolutionary theorists (Boyd and
Richerson, 1985; Weick, 1979; Burgelman, 1991;
and Singh, 1990) argue that traits can be
acquired within a generation through learning and
imitation. A Lamarkian view on the acquisition
of traits appears more appropriate than strict
Darwinism for organization and management
applications of social evolution theory. To date,
strict social Darwinists have developed no
adequate solutions to operationally identify an
organizational generation and an intergenerational transmission vehicle.
Social Darwinian theorists emphasize a continuous and gradual process of evolution. In The
Origin of Species, Darwin (1936: 361) wrote, 'as
natural selection acts solely by accumulating

<-----Page 12----->180

A. H. Van de Ven 


slight, successive, favourable variations, it can
produce no great or sudden modifications; it can
act only by short and slow steps.' Other
evolutionists posit a saltational theory of evolution, such as punctuated equilibrium (Gould
and Eldrich, 1977; Arnold and Fristrup, 1982),
which Tushman and Romanelti (1985) and
Gersick (1991) introduced to the management
literature. Whether an evolutionary change proceeds at gradual vs. saltational rates is an
empirical matter, for the rate of change does not
fundamentally alter the theory of evolution-at
least as it has been adopted thus far by strategy
scholars. However, measurement of the rate of
evolutionary change is a formidable empirical
challenge. The French author and aviator, Saint
Exupery, aptly stated 'the time which adds
something new is by no means the same as the
time which spreads itself out' (quotation in
De Rosney, 1970). The time required for
phylogenesis (the generation of originals through
variation or speciation processes) is much greater
and less predictable than the time required for
ontogenesis (the reproduction of originals through
selection and adaptation processes). Empirically,
the different temporal durations involved in the
generation vs. the reproduction of originals in
the social sciences are very difficult to determine,
because the nature of uncertainty is profoundly
different; in ontogenesis the improbability of
reproduction is given at the beginning, while in
phylogenesis the improbability of origination is
gathered at the end of the process. Thus, the
temporal duration of generating an original can
only be known retrospectively after the fact,
while the temporal duration of reproducing
originals can be determined prospectively before
the fact.
The paleontologist, Gould (1989), has argued
that another basic distinction between Darwinian
evolution and his punctuated equilibrium theory
is hierarchical level. This distinction has not yet
been incorporated in the management literature,
but ought to be. Gould (1989) points out
that classical Darwinism locates the sorting of
evolutionary change at a single level of objects.
This sorting is natural selection operating through
the differential births and deaths of organisms,
as exemplified in many recent studies on organizational birth and death rates by population
ecologists (see reviews in Carroll and Hannan,
1989, and Hannan and Freeman, 1989). The

punctuated equilibrium model adds a hierarchical
dimension to evolutionary theory by distinguishing this sorting (a description of differential birth and death) from species selection (a
causal claim about the basis of sorting). 'Speciation is a property of populations (organisms do
not speciate), while extinction [a sorting process]
is often a simple concatenation of deaths among
organisms' (Gould, 1989: 122). This multilevel
view of evolution is extended by Arnold and
Fristrup (1982), who emphasize that adaptation
and selection can occur at multiple levels (both
the species and organism levels). Adaptation is
the class of heritable characters that have a
positive influence on the fitness of an organism
within a constraining situation. Selection focuses
on the evolutionary process of choosing new
situations (i.e. variations). So selection assumes
variation, while adaptation assumes fitting within
a selected environment (Arnold and Fristrup,
1982: 119).
In conclusion, we might think of these alternative families of process theories as having three
components: a set of starting conditions, a
functional end-point, and an emergent process
of change. Life cycle theory incorporates all three
parts, although it largely directs attention to the
starting input conditions of institutional rules,
customs, or habits that prescribe programs or
routines of action that must be followed in
developing an organization entity. By describing
in some detail a required stage sequence, a life
cycle theory implies a final state and a process
of change. Of course, these latter parts are often
left implicit in the description of stages. A
teleological theory has two of the components,
although its central emphasis is on visions of
future goals or final end states of an organizational
entity. At the outset, it does not specify a
required sequence of events or stages, but it does
describe the form of organization which is
the end-point of the development, and, by
implication, the process for getting to the end.
Thus, both life cycle and teleological theories are
predictive. Dialectical and evolutionary theories
center on the means of action themselves; i.e.
the dynamic process of social construction and
transformation of alternative forms within and
across generations of competing organizational
routines, forms and institutions. Dialectical and
evolutionary theories explain only how change
and development occur, along with indicators to

<-----Page 13----->Strategy Process Suggestions
enable us to identify key developmental constructs
(e.g. selection, action loops) at any point in
time. While dialectical and evolutionary theories
provide rich explanations of emergent processes
of change, they are not predictive; they are only
explanatory process theories.

DESIGN RESEARCH TO OBSERVE
PROCESS
Most studies of strategy process to date have
been retrospective case histories conducted after
the outcomes were known. However, it is widely
recognized that prior knowledge of the success
or failure of a strategic change effort invariably
biases a study's findings. While historical analysis
is necessary for examining many questions and
concerted efforts can be undertaken to minimize
bias, it is generally better, if possible, to initiate
historical study before the outcomes of a strategic
change process become known. It is even better
to undertake real-time study of strategic change
processes as they unfold in their natural field
settings.
Time itself, sets a frame of reference which
directly affects our perceptions of change. As
Pettigrew (1985) notes, the more we look at
present-day events, the easier it is to identify
change; the longer we stay with an emergent
process and the further back we go to disentangle
its origins, the more likely we are to identify
continuities. Appreciating this dilemma motivates
my third recommendation that investigators
carefully design their studies to observe strategy
process in such a way that is consistent with their
definition and theory of process.
For example, if the purpose of a study is to
understand how to manage the formulation or
implementation of an organizational strategy, it
will be necessary for researchers to place themselves into the manager's temporal and contextual
frames of reference. Presumably, this would
initially involve conducting a retrospective case
history to understand the context and events
leading up to the present strategy being investigated. However, the major focus of the study
would entail conducting real-time observations of
the events and activities in strategy development
while they occur in time, and without knowing
a priori the outcomes of these events and
activities.

181

Regularly scheduled and intermittent real-time
observations are necessary to observe if and how
changes occur over time. Repetitive surveys and
interviews provide comparative-static observations of the organizational unit or strategy
being tracked over time. Difference scores
between time periods on these dimensions would
determine if and what changes occurred in the
organizational unit or strategy. But to understand
how these changes came about, there is a need
to supplement regularly-scheduled data collection
with intermittent real-time data. For example,
this would involve observing key committee
meetings, decision or crisis events, and conducting
informal discussions with key organizational
participants. Thus, while difference scores on
dimensions measured through regularly scheduled
surveys and interviews identify if and what
changes occurred, real-time observations are
needed to understand how these changes
occurred.
As Argyris (1968; 1985) has forcefully argued
over the years, significant new methods and skills
of action science are called for to conduct
this ' kind of longitudinal real-time research.
In addition, it implies significant reseacher
commitment and organizational access, which
few researchers have achieved to date. As a
consequence, very few developmental studies of
strategy formulation and implementation have
been conducted. One reason why gaining organizational access has been problematic is because
researchers seldom place themselves into the
manager's frame of reference to conduct their
studies. As Van de Ven, Angle, and Poole (1989)
discuss, without observing a change process from
a manager's perspective, it becomes difficult (if
not impossible) for an investigator to understand
the dynamics confronting managers who are
involved in a strategic change effort, and thereby
generate new knowledge that advances the theory
and practice of strategy process.
Furthermore, if organizational participants do
not understand the relevance of a study, there
is little to motivate their providing access and
information to an investigator. At issue here is not
that strategic management research incorporates
elements of consulting practice. The issue is one
of formulating and addressing important research
questions that capture the attention and motivation of scholars and practitioners alike in the
merits for studying them. Clearly, the outcomes

<-----Page 14----->182

A. H. Van de Ven 


of research on an important question may not
provide immediate pay-offs to practitioners or
academics. Often by definition, truly important
research questions do not have clear solutions
until after the research has been conducted. If
solutions are well known in advance of the
research, the question may be appropriate for
consulting practice or an internal management
study, but clearly not for basic scientific research.
Thus, at the time of designing research and
negotiating access to organizations, prospective
solutions to applied problems are secondary in
comparison with the importance of the research
question. A good indicator of such a research
question is its self-evident capability (when
properly articulated) to motivate attention and
enthusiasm of scholars and practitioners alike.
In launching our Minnesota Innovation
Research Program (see Van de Ven e t a [ . , 1989),
we found that a useful way to begin this kind of
longitudinal research is to conduct meetings
(often with a served breakfast or lunch) with
small groups (eight to twelve) managers or
representatives of various organizations which
were about to initiate comparable strategic change
efforts or ventures in their natural organizational
settings. In these hour-and-a-half meetings we
introduced our research question (e.g. 'How
and why do innovations develop over time?'),
discussed why it is important to advancing theory
and practice, and outlined a longitudinal realtime research strategy for studying the research
question in comparable field settings over time.
Participants then shared their opinions of the
research question, why it was important or useful
to study, and how the research design might
be modified to make it workable in their
organizational settings. The meetings concluded
by thanking participants for their useful ideas
and indicating that we would contact them
individually to negotiate access to study the
question in their organizational settings. Following these meetings, the research design was
modified as deemed necessary, and negotiations
began with individual organizations. A substantial
subset of those represented at the meetings
agreed to provide access to conduct the research.
Having negotiated access to a manageable
(small) number of comparable organizational
sites, the longitudinal research can begin by
undertaking the following basic steps. (See Van
de Ven and Poole (1989; 1990) for detailed

procedures in each step.) First, it is often
necessary to obtain baseline information and
develop a retrospective case history of the context
and events leading up to the present venture
being investigated. While the historical baseline
is being developed, real-time study can begin
using a variety of data collection methods, and
by attending and observing regularly scheduled
meetings of the management team, administrative
review meetings, and conferences related to the
venture being investigated as it unfolds over
time.
Researchers could use an event as the datum,
or unit of observation, and record all the events
that occur as the venture develops over time.
Events require careful definition, and vary with
the subject and concepts being investigated. Only
by being clear about the subject and conceptual
categories does the researcher know 'what'
eventslactivities to record, and 'where' to look
for them. If the researcher doesn't look in the
'right' place, then nothing may be recorded, or
if the conceptual category is too broad, it can
include confounding data. For example, in our
study of the internal corporate venturing process,
Garud and Van de Ven (this issue) defined
events as instances when changes were observed
to occur in each of the constructs of the
conceptual model: i.e. in the innovation idea and
activities, personnel appointments and roles, unit
relationships with others, environmental and
organizational context, and outcomes.
Data on the occurrence of each event could
be entered into a qualitative computer data base
(such as Rbase), and at a minimum should
include the date, actor, action, outcome (if
observable), and data source. A chronological
recording of these events as they occur over time
becomes the 'raw' data base. Each of these
events is then coded on a set of dichotomous
variables, which reflect the presencelabsence or
occurrence1nonoccurrence of indicators selected
to measure key constructs in one's conceptual
model. For example, an indicator of strategy
formulation might be to code each event in terms
of whether actors did or did not articulate a
change in ideas about the strategy.
This coded event sequence data base can then
be analyzed in terms of the vocabulary and
alternative forms of temporal progressions discussed before. Unfortunately, space limitations
prevent an adequate discussion of the data

<-----Page 15----->Strategy Process Suggestions
analysis problems of identifying patterns in event
sequence data and of inferring what they mean.
Obviously, event sequence data do not necessarily
speak for themselves. Van de Ven and Poole
(1989) discuss some of the steps involved in
drawing statistical and conceptual inferences from
event sequence data. Abbott (1990) proposes
methods for identifying temporal sequence patterns among coded events in such a dataset. In
addition, substantive models of strategy process
can be evaluated by using log-linear and logit
analysis on categorical time series data, and
standard time series regression analysis on frequency counts of coded events computed for
fixed temporal intervals (e.g. weekly, monthly,
or quarterly intervals). Garud and Van de Ven
(this issue), Van de Ven and Polley (1992), and
Van de Ven and Garud (1992) illustrate this new
methodology of event sequence analysis to
examine process models of internal corporate
venturing, trial-and-error learning, and the coevolution of technological and institutional innovations, respectively.

CONCLUDING EXAMPLE OF
SUGGESTIONS MADE (WITH
REACTIONS FROM LARRY E.
GREINER)
In conclusion, we must touch upon a few basic
normative and teleological questions. Where do
we go with this strategy process research and
search for process models? Where do we want
to end up? While readers may have different
answers, my first suggestion, defines the meaning
of process, implies that we not only want to
assume or describe the occurrence of strategic
change processes, we also want to explain
how and why they occur. Scientifically valid
explanation not only requires systematic procedures for observing and analyzing events as
they occur over time (along the lines of my third
suggestion), it also requires the development and
evaluation of theories of the change process itself
(the second suggestion). Hopefully this journey
will yield more robust ways to understand how
and why strategic change develops over time.
Moreover, it may produce more constructive
and penetrating dialogue among scholars and
practitioners about their models of strategy
process.

183

To illustrate this conclusion, let us reexamine
Greiner's (1972) well-known model of organizational growth outlined on the bottom of
Table 1. Greiner's model clearly uses the third
meaning of process as a developmental sequence
of events, and proposes that organizational
growth progresses through five stages of evolution
and revolution: (1) creativity and leadership, (2)
direction and autonomy, (3) delegation and
control, (4) coordination and red tape, and (5)
collaboration and revitalization. Readers may
wish to read footnotes 5-9 during this section,
since they represent excerpts from an interesting
and constructive dialogue that I carried on with
Professor Greiner about my reexamination of his
model.5
To evaluate the status of Greiner's applied
theory, it is useful to recognize that he implicitly
borrows conceptual elements from three of the
ideal types of process theories. In so doing,
Greiner's model contains a number of conceptual
anomalies, which in turn suggest a number of
promising areas for further theory building. In
the main, the model is rooted in a life cycle
theory of change, in which 'historical forces
[organization age, size, growth rate, and stages
of evolution and revolution] shape the future
growth of organizations' (Greiner, 1972: 166).
The quest for growth represents an underdeveloped teleological element in the model. Greiner
states his position that 'the future of an organization may be less determined by outside forces
than it is by the organization's history. . . [Blehavior is determined primarily by previous events
and experiences, not by what lies ahead' (p. 166).
Beyond this introductory statement, the 'pull' of
an envisioned end state of growth is largely

I sent a prepublication draft of this paper to Prof. Larry
E. Greiner at the University of Southern California. H e
responded with a very useful set of comments, which not
only clarify, amplify and correct my reexamination of his
model, but also exemplify how the meanings, theories, and
vocabulary of process suggested in this paper can facilitate
more penetrating and constructive dialogue among scholars
than in the past. In order to exemplify this constructive level
of dialogue, I have not changed my reassessment of the
model in the text from that which Prof. Greiner reviewed,
and (with his permission) include his comments in footnotes
to pertinent statements made in the text.
Greiner: You might give my article a little context in terms
of time and place-since it was written in 1972, one of the
first such models. I might add too that I think the model
was the precursor if not the first 'punctuated equilibrium'
model-at least Tushman has said this to me.

<-----Page 16----->184

A. H. Van de Ven

ignored by Greiner, as are considerations of
alternative paths to achieve the desired end of
growth; instead only one particular sequence of
developmental stages is discussed. The term
'evolu~on'is used loosely to describe prolonged
periods of growth where no major upheaval (or
'revolution') occurs in organizational practices.
Thus, Greiner does not borrow conceptual
elements from the ideal type evolutionary theory
(as we have described it). He does, however,
entertain dialectical theory by observing that 'as
a company progresses through developmental
phases, each evolutionary period creates its own
revolution' (p. 166). However, with the exception
of asserting the life cycle view that crises are
immanent to each evolutionary stage, Greiner
does not explain how these divergent forces
emerge out of unitary progressions within each
stage, and how these antagonistic forces converge
and collide to mediate a synthesis in the next
stage, as a dialectical theory would require.' As
Greiner: ,This [sentence] hurts a bit because I tried very
consciously to use dialectical explanation (without calling it
that to H B R readers) throughout the evolving stages and
crises. I think you will see this logic if you go through each
stage's description, such as at the end of the Phase 2
description where I write, 'although the new directive
techniques channel energy more efficiently into growth
(thesis), they eventually become inappropriate for controlling
a larger, more diverse and complex organization. Lower level
employees find themselves restricted by a cumbersome and
centralized hierarchy. . . thus a crisis develops from demands
for greater autonomy by lower level managers (antithesis).
The synthesis link I then make (but perhaps not as explicitly
as I should) when I introduce 'Delegation' in stage 3 as lower
levels receive more autonomy-though
this autonomy is
different from the kind they were asking for-and this in
turn becomes the new thesis. You o r others might not agree
with how I use dialectics o r that I don't explain them clearly
enough, but I can say that I was very conscious of it at the
time, and I do think it is more evident in my more concrete
explanations than you note. In fact, I have had past
correspondence with some dialectical sociologists about the
model's use of dialectics, which was quite uncommon at the
time in management literature. I also think it is the dialectics
that added the power struggle reality and made the article
so successful in managerial reaction.
[But in agreement with you] I would say my model is a
reasonably explicit attempt to combine unitary life cycle with
dialectical theories-but
not teleological. For me, life cycle
explains the 'form' of the unitary stages, while the dialectics
explain the underlying dynamics of movement. For example,
I put the 'crises' in the model because I could not find data
showing the stages as naturally and automatically evolving
one after the other. Thus, it is not a model where a future
life o r end state is assured-(there are even divergent paths
which are not really discussed in the article. such as failing
to solve a crisis o r dying if the crisis continues). My reason
for saying it is not teleological is that there is no envisioned
end state that pulls the process-for
me it is the current

this overly brief critique suggests, a fruitful way
to evaluate and extend applied models of process
is to anchor the analysis in more basic and
general theories of process.
To empirically examine Greiner's model (as
formulated in 1972) from a developmental process
perspective, one would ask the following kind of
question, 'Does organizational growth commonly
progress through the sequence of stages that
Greiner proposes?' A key conceptual move for
addressing this research question is to view
Greiner's stages as categories of events, and not
to assume that these categories of events occur
in any particular sequence of progression over
time. Thus, instead of viewing organizational
growth as a unitary progression of a linear
sequence of stages based on a life cycle theory
of change, one is open to more empirical
possibilities if the process of organizational
growth is viewed in terms of a variety of other
models of event progressions and theories of
change process.
One way to do this is to adopt a research
design as illustrated in Figure 1. In comparison
with Greiner's initial formulation of the model
in Table 1, this research design redefines the five
stages of organizational evolution and the four
revolutionary crises identified within the stages
into nine conceptual tracks or categories of
events, and shifts time from a vertical to
horizontal axis.' In so doing, one can not only
gain a richer appreciation of how events pertaining
to organizational evolution and revolution unfold
over time, but also how the multiple tracks of
event categories are related and thereby facilitate
and constrain the overall process of organizational
growth.
Guided by this research design, one could
undertake longitudinal study of a number of
organizations from birth to maturity. One would
gather data on the chronological sequence of
activities or events that occurred in the development of each organization. The observed activities
dynamics within the organization that are driving it forwardconvergence around the thesis of each stage and then running
into resistance (antithesis) and requiring reorientation for the
conflict to be resolved. The model in fact has no ending and
concludes with a question mark.
' Van de Ven: A careful examination of the conceptual
overlap between the nine substantive event categories in
Greiner's model would prune the set to a smaller and more
manageable number of tracks. However, we will not
undertake this needed theory building task in this example.

or categories outlined in Figure 1. For example,
the creativity track would not only include the
occurrence of the initial business idea on which
the organization was founded, it would also
record all events that occurred to further invent,
develop, and adapt the business idea (or strategy)
of the organization. So also, the delegation
track would include all events related to the
decentralization of responsibilities, the establishment of profit centers and bonuses, top management restraints to managing by exception, and
similar indicators of delegation activities described
by Greiner (1972: 170-171). Clearly, events
pertaining to each substantive event track listed
in Figure 1 can occur repeatedly during the life
of an organization, and often in no necessary
temporal order. Recording events along these
different substantive categories or tracks (rather
than a single track as has been done in the past)
greatly liberates one from the erroneous and
confining assumption that the life cycle of

185

an organization proceeds in a simple unitary
sequence of stages.
Event sequence analysis could begin after the
field observations have concluded and events
were coded along the conceptual tracks. This
analysis would consist of identifying the order
and sequence of events for each organization,
and then comparing the observed sequence with
the proposed sequence of events in Greiner's
model. A strong test of Greiner's model would
require that allX events pertaining to creativity
and leadership occur first, direction and autonomy
second, delegation and control third, coordination
and red tape fourth, and collaboration and
revitalization last.
I doubt if empirical evidence from such a study
will substantiate Greiner's model of organizational growth because no empirical support has
been found for a unitary sequence of stages in
other studies of innovation development (see
Schroeder et al., 1986). However, this conclusion
is premature because (as stated before) very
few longitudinal studies have examined the
development of strategic change processes in
general, and to my knowledge, no studies have
specifically examined organizational growth as a
developmental sequence of events along the lines
suggested here.'
Greiner: My only concern here is with your use of the
word 'allq-at least I would not argue for 'all,' though I
would argue that the 'bulk' of events o r the 'median' should
occur during these time periods. While the HBR article
draws a graphic line at the beginning and end of each stage
in its pictorial portrayal to the reader, I have always said
that there is bound to be 'slop over' between stages-for
example, 'autonomy' concerns don't suddenly die away with
initial attempts at 'delegation.'
[In the conclusion of his comments, Greiner states]
Probably some of this you were unaware of because I could
not explicitly discuss it in the article. I don't think my
suggestions change your basic points and hopefully they add
a little more clarification. . . Messing with another person's
piece of art is always a little tricky. But I hope you know
my intentions are good, as I know yours are too.
" Greiner: My sample was small, mostly secondary data, and
limited largely to industrialiconsumer goods companies. S o
there is a need for a larger more systematic study-and it's
interesting that none has been conducted over all these years
on my model o r any others for that matter. Such a study
might go beyond determining if in fact there is the linear
order of stages and crises to find out: Are there different
growth stages for different industries? D o companies that fail
to grow pursue a different order of stages, o r do they fail to
resolve certain crises?
Future studies don't necessarily have to measure every
aspect of every hypothesized stage to begin to check out the
model. For example, each stage contains a clear statement
about formal organization structure, which is usually public
information. So just a pass at this issue would tell us a lot.

Hopefully, this 'call' for research on strategy
process will trigger strategy scholars to engage
in these conceptual and empirical issues. Moreover, in doing so, strategy scholars will also
advance and modify the suggestions made here
to clarify the meanings and theories of process,
and methods for observing process.

NOTES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This paper is based on a presentation made at
the Minnesota Conference on Strategy, Process
Research, October, 1991, organized by Bala
Chakravarthy and Yves Doz. I particularly
appreciate the helpful comments of Bala Chakravarthy and Larry Greiner in developing this
paper.
