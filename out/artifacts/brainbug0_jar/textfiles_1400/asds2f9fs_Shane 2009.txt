Editorial

Introduction to the focused issue on the biological basis of business
In recent years, researchers have begun to seek biological explanations for business behavior (Camerer, Loewenstein, & Prelec,
2005; Glimcher, 2003; Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher, & Fehr,
2005). This growing stream of research has looked at such topics
as genetic inﬂuences on leadership, entrepreneurship, and job satisfaction (Arvey, Bouchard, Segal, & Abraham, 1989; Arvey, Rotundo,
Johnson, Zhang, & McGue, 2006; Keller, Bouchard, Arvey, Segal, &
Dawis, 1992; McCall, Cavanaugh, Arvey, & Taubman, 1997;
Nicolaou, Shane, Cherkas, Hunkin, & Spector, 2008); the role of
neural circuits in perception of fair treatment, purchasing decisions,
investment behavior, and response to ﬁnancial reward (Sanfey,
Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2003; Camerer et al., 2005;
Knutson, Rick, Wimmer, Prelec, & Loewenstein, 2007); the effect of
hormones on occupational choice, managerial decisions, and risk
taking (Dabbs, Alford, & Fielden, 1998; Dabbs, de La Rue, &
Williams, 1990); and the physiological effects of workplace stress
(Fox, Dwyer, & Ganster, 1993; White, Thornhill, & Hampson, 2006),
organizational reward systems, and leadership styles (Cameron,
2008).
This research has generated some fascinating ﬁndings. For instance, we now know that there is a genetic component to leadership; that different parts of the neural system are stimulated by
immediate and delayed ﬁnancial reward; and that hormones affect
occupational choice. And these are only a few illustrative examples
of what research into the biological basis of business has taught us
about people’s business-related behavior. A new school of thought
about business that draws upon biological explanations is currently emerging.
Unfortunately most management researchers know little about
these ﬁndings. Much of this research has been published in journals that management scholars do not routinely follow, and the
different studies themselves have been isolated from one another,
making it difﬁcult to see the cumulative set of ﬁndings unless
scholars systematically look for it.
Because of the limited connection between research on the biological basis of business and mainstream academic thought on the
topic, we believed that systematic effort to bring this emerging
school of thought to the attention of the mainstream of the academic
research community was necessary. Therefore, we put together this
special research forum on the biological basis of business.
Our goals
Our effort in this special research forum was simple, but also
broad. We sought to assemble a set of papers that explain how different aspects of human biology affect business-related behavior.
Our aims were threefold: First, we sought to bring together research that examines how biological factors affect different areas
of management from organization behavior to entrepreneurship

to business strategy to ﬁnancial decision making to marketing.
We believe that the phenomenon orientation of management research often leads researchers examining similar theoretical issues
in different areas of business study to fail to connect their work. By
organizing a special issue around the theme of biology rather than
around different business topics as is often the case in management research, we hoped to bring together the ﬁndings in disparate areas in a way that illuminated the power of the theme.
Second, we hoped to link together research that takes fundamentally different approaches to examining the biological basis
of business. For instance, we want to bring together researchers
who examine genetics, the physiology of emotion, brain imaging,
hormones (among other topics) because we believe that combining
research from these different perspectives will help to stimulate
thought about the connections between them. These connections
are important, we believe, because a biological basis of business
will ultimately need to collect all of these pieces into a coherent
and related whole.
Third, we sought to bring to the attention of the academic community in management the widespread research that has been
conducted to examine the biological basis of business to introduce
additional researchers to the methodologies used in this area, to
show the important stylized facts that have been collected, and
to demonstrate the evidence for theoretical arguments that have
been amassed to date.
The results of our effort
Having put together the special issue, we believe that we have
achieved these goals. We have assembled papers that look at a
wide range of dimensions of business from consumer behavior to
leadership to entrepreneurship. The papers draw on a variety of
different approaches from behavioral genetics to neuro-imaging.
We hope that the academic community that studies business will
take note of the wide range of evidence on the biological basis of
business amassed here.
We accepted eight papers in the special issue (out of 23 that
were submitted). While the accepted papers differ somewhat in
their composition from those that were not accepted, both the submitted papers and those accepted fell into three broad topics: hormones, genetics, and neural mechanisms. Below we categorize the
papers appearing in this issue by topic area.
Hormones
Two of the papers in the special issue examine the role of hormones. Although other research has shown the importance of a
variety of hormones from cortisol to dopamine (Fox et al., 1993;
Hamer & Copeland, 1999), both papers in the special issue focus

on testosterone. Interestingly, one paper examines testosterone as
a cause of behavior, while the other looks at the effects of behavior
on testosterone levels.
In ‘‘Testosterone-Status Mismatch Lowers Collective Efﬁcacy in
Groups: Evidence from a Slope as Predictor Multilevel Structural
Equation Model,” Michael Zyphur and Jayanth Narayanan show
that there is no direct relationship between testosterone levels
and individual status. However, when the status levels of group
members are not well matched to their testosterone levels, the
group becomes less effective as a collective entity. Consistent with
observations of group behavior among other members of the animal kingdom, it appears that groups are most effective when individuals high in testosterone, and so more likely to seek dominance,
are in more dominant positions.
In ‘‘The Effect of Conspicuous Consumption on Men’s Testosterone Levels,” Gad Saad and John Vongas look at testosterone levels
as a dependent variable. They argue that men’s testosterone level
responds to their level of social status. They ﬁnd experimental evidence that when men engage in acts of conspicuous consumption –
which they argue is a signal to attract women – their testosterone
levels rise. This pattern suggests that consumer behavior has a biological component.
Taken together these two papers provide evidence of an interesting reciprocal pattern between status and testosterone levels.
Having appropriate status for one’s testosterone level helps one
function better as a part of a social group, while increasing one’s
social status enhances one’s testosterone level.
Genetics
Three papers in the special issue examine genetics and aspects
of organizational behavior. Unlike the two papers on hormones,
the three genetics papers all examine the causal effects of innate
factors on dimensions of work-related behavior. They also use a
common methodology. Although some molecular genetics research has recently examined aspects of workplace behavior, the
three papers in this issue take the form of twin studies.
Two of the papers examine how genetic factors inﬂuence the tendency of people to become entrepreneurs. In ‘‘The Genetic Basis of
Entrepreneurship: Effects of Gender and Personality,” Zhen Zhang,
Michael Zyphur, Jayanth Narayanan, Richard Arvey, Sankalp Chaturved, Bruce Avolio, Paul Lichtenstein, and Gerry Larsson look at
pairs of identical and fraternal twins to identify the heritability of
entrepreneurship. The authors ﬁnd that genetic effects on this occupational choice are observed for women but not for men, suggesting
that men may be more affected by environmental factors when making the decision whether or not to found companies. The authors also
ﬁnd evidence of genetic correlation with the personality traits of
extraversion and neuroticism for women, while, for men, they ﬁnd
that the correlation between the tendency to start businesses and
the personality trait of extraversion is largely environmental.
In ‘‘Opportunity Recognition and the Tendency to be an Entrepreneur: A Bivariate Genetics Perspective,” Nicos Nicolaou, Scott
Shane, Lynn Cherkas, and Tim Spector examine the relationship between opportunity recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur. Examining a sample of identical and fraternal twins, these
authors ﬁnd a heritability of 0.45 for the tendency to identify
new business opportunities. Drawing on their previous work on
the heritability of the tendency to be an entrepreneur, the authors
show that more than half of the correlation between opportunity
recognition and the tendency to be an entrepreneur comes from
common genetic factors.
In ‘‘Beyond Genetic Explanations for Leadership: The Moderating Role of the Social Environment,” Zhen Zhang, Remus Ilies,
and Richard D Arvey look at the effect of genetics on a different
dependent variable – leadership. Drawing on previous behavioral

genetics research on the achievement of leadership roles, the
authors examine how the environment in which people are raised
interacts with their genetic predispositions to explain leadership
role occupancy. Exploiting a sample of male identical and fraternal
twins, the authors ﬁnd that genetic inﬂuences on the achievement
of leadership roles are greater for those twins who were raised in
less enriching family environments.
Taken together, these three papers show that a signiﬁcant component of organizational behavior is innate. Moreover, they show
that researchers are beginning to identify more complex patterns
in the genetics of work-related behavior, considering gender differences in the importance of genetic factors, gene-environment
interactions, and common genetic factors, when explaining organizational behavior.
Neuroscience
The third set of three papers involves brain scans to look at neural mechanisms. The ﬁrst of these papers, ‘‘Exploring the Neural
Basis of Fairness: A Model of Neuro-Organizational Justice,” by
Constant Beugre is conceptual, and integrates neuroscience with
the organizational justice literature. It proposes that judgments
of fairness not only affect behavior and cognitive and emotional
processing, but also inﬂuence neural processing; that is, it affects
the actual functioning of the brain.
‘‘The Biological Bases of Unfairness: Neuroimaging Evidence For
the Distinctiveness of Procedural and Distributive Justice” by James
Dulebohn, Donald Conlon, Issidoros Sarinopoulos, Robert B Davison, and Gerry McNamara provides empirical evidence of the neural basis of perceptions of organizational justice. Using fMRI
methods to look at the parts of the brain activated by procedural
and distributive justice, the authors ﬁnd that unfair procedures
tended to stimulate the parts of the brain that govern social cognition, whereas unfair outcomes tended to stimulate the parts of the
brain that govern emotion.
In ‘‘Neural Mechanisms of Social Inﬂuence,” Malia Mason, Rebecca Dyer and Michael Norton used fMRI to examine the parts
of the brain that are most affected by objects that others have endorsed or rejected. They found that the medial prefrontal cortex
identiﬁed whether objects were endorsed or rejected (as opposed
to not socially inﬂuenced), whereas the caudate was where popular
and unpopular objects were differentiated.
Taken together these three papers indicate that the business-related behavior of human beings is inﬂuenced by how different
parts of the brain process information. At the most basic level,
some portion of work-related behavior appears to be governed
by the parts of the brain responsible for emotion, while other
behavior is governed by different parts of the brain.
A possible convergence
The set of papers accepted in this special issue suggests a possible convergence between three biological dimensions – genetics,
hormones, and brain function – in efforts to explain work-related
behavior. Although none of the papers in this volume examine
the effect of all three biological dimensions simultaneously, convergence is suggested by research that links genetics, hormones,
brain function and business-related activity. Therefore, we believe
that a fruitful area for future research on the biological basis of
business lies in exploring the links between genetics, hormones,
brain function, and work-related activity.
What we did not see
Because the domain of this research forum was very broad – the
examination of any aspect of biology on any aspect of business – it

<-----Page 2----->Editorial / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 110 (2009) 67–69

would not have been possible to receive papers all possible biological inﬂuences on all dimensions of business. Nevertheless, we
were struck by the limited set of topics covered by the papers
and, consequently, by the absence of submissions on several topics
that we thought would be the focus of research on the biological
basis of business. For example, we were surprised not to receive
submissions on biological basis of many aspects of business activity, including risk taking, decision making, innovation, creativity,
planning, and response to authority.
We were also struck by the limited examination of the relationship between hormones and work-related behavior. We did not receive papers that explored the effects on work place behavior of
hormones other than testosterone, nor did we receive papers that
examined the effect of testosterone on many aspects of business,
including occupational choice, and leadership role attainment.
We also expected more papers that would consider hormones as
a dependent variable, explaining, for instance, how job stress or
managerial actions affect hormone release.
We were surprised by the narrow range of topics covered by the
papers that examined business from the perspective of neuroscience. We did not receive papers on neural functioning and decision
making, risk taking, planning, wishful thinking, inter-temporal
choice, and organizational sense making. We were surprised not
to see papers on the neural basis of decision making under uncertainty, given the focus of recent research on that topic (Hsu et al.,
2005). Also, we expected to see papers on the neural basis of strategic decision making (Bhatt & Camerer, 2005) and purchasing
decisions (Knutson et al., 2007).
Furthermore, we were struck by the narrow range of topics covered by the papers on genetics. We were surprised that we did not
receive papers on the genetic basis of creativity, innovation, job
satisfaction, management styles, or job turnover. We were also
struck by the fact that we received no molecular genetics papers,
even though recent research has linked speciﬁc genes to ﬁnancial
risk taking (Caldu & Dreher, 2007), altruism (Barach, 2007), and
persistence (Comings et al., 2000), among other things.
Finally, we were surprised not to have received papers on the
physiological effects of work. We thought we would have received
papers that looked at physiological reactions to work environments and organizational reward mechanisms, such as money, recognition and power, and how they affect organizational behavior.
Conclusions
In sum, the papers in the special issue illustrate that biological
factors affect different areas of management from organization
behavior to entrepreneurship. They also illustrate that a wide
range of biological factors from genetics to hormones to brain function affect business. We believe that the biological inﬂuences discussed in this issue might be provocative to many in the
academic community, and look forward to a debate on that topic.

We also hope that the issue will spur scholars to consider the
importance of biology to business practice, particularly the potential convergence of the inﬂuence of genetics, hormones, and brain
function.
