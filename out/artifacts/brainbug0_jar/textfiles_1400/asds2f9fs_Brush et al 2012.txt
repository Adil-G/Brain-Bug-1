(Received 27 December 2010; ﬁnal version received 15 September 2011)
Drawing on literature from organizational behavior, strategic change and
management of technology, we examine the new ventures’ readiness for funding
by angel investors, using a dataset of 332 ﬁrms that sought investment from a
prominent angel group located outside of Boston, MA during 2007–2008.
Findings suggest that perceptions of venture readiness for funding change
throughout the angel evaluation process. Tangible, objective organizational
characteristics are important during the ﬁrst decision-making stage, while
intangible, subjective new venture characteristics are more important during
subsequent decision stages. This suggests that what the entrepreneur perceives as
an organization ready for outside funding may be very diﬀerent from the angel
investor’s perception. Interestingly, location of the new venture remains
signiﬁcant throughout the angel investment decision-making process, implying
that entrepreneurs need to think carefully before applying for funding outside
their local area. Implications are discussed.
Keywords: readiness; angel investing; sequential logistical regression

Introduction
Angel ﬁnancing is deﬁned as ‘‘[i]nformal venture capital-equity investments and
non-collateral forms of lending made by private individuals . . . using their own
money, directly in unquoted companies in which they have no family connection
PricewaterhouseCoopers/National Venture Capital Association MoneyTree Report,
2004. Thomson Reuters; https://www.pwcmoneytree.com’’ (Harrison and Mason
1999). It plays a crucial role in ﬁnancing growth-oriented ventures by ﬁlling the gap
between informal family and friends and more formal institutional (venture capital)
investment (Harrison and Mason 1999; Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000).
However, comparatively little is known about the angel market, due in large part to
its invisible nature (Mason and Harrison 2008).
Given the private nature of angel investment data, getting exact investment
numbers is diﬃcult. Recent research in the US estimates the amount of capital
provided by angels is nearly equal to the money provided by venture capital ﬁrms
(Sohl 2005). Worldwide, researchers estimate that angel investors provide up to
11 times the amount of funding provided by venture capitalists (Reynolds, Bygrave,
and Autio 2003). Speciﬁcally, the Center for Venture Research estimates that US

angels invested $20.1 billion in 611,900 companies in 2010 (http://wsbe.unh.edu/cvr),
while the National Venture Capital Association reports that venture capitalists
invested $21.8 billion in 3277 companies (http://www.nvca.org). Further, the NVCA
suggests that the impact of angel ﬁnancing from groups and individuals overall is
approximately $100 billion in the United States. Given that angels often focus much
of their investment in early stage ventures, researchers estimate that in 2004 alone
angels provided approximately $6 billion in early-stage seed funding compared
to only $330 million from formal venture capitalists (Wiltbank 2005; MoneyTree
Survey 2004).
A signiﬁcant portion of research on angel ﬁnancing explores the supply side of
the equation and study angel ﬁnancing looking at the determinants of angel
ﬁnancing (Harrison and Mason 1999; Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 2002; Smith,
Harrison, and Mason 2010; Wiltbank, Sudek, and Read 2010) using an agency
theory or social psychology lens to explore diﬀerent aspects of the investment
process, such as deal generation, screening, valuation, deal structure, monitoring,
and exit (Maula, Autio, and Arenius 2005). Research investigates the expertise of
angel investors (Morrissette 2007; Smith, Harrison, and Mason 2010), information
processing (Sudek, Mitteness, and Baucus 2008), decision-making processes (Wong
2002; Wiltbank, Sudek and Read 2010), and investment practices (Wiltbank and
Boeker 2007).
Comparatively less research focuses on the demand side of angel ﬁnance. Most
of it focuses on bootstrapping behaviors (Carter and Van Auken 2005; Winborg
and Landstrom 2001), while other work explores attention to activities that
legitimize the venture, such as obtaining licenses, paying insurance, or building trust
(Mason and Harrison 1999). Less is known about the characteristics, strategies and
behavior of new ventures that are positioning to be considered for investment by
angels or angel groups (Mason 2006). This is the research gap our study is
addressing. Considering that there are more than 330 angel groups in the US and
Canada and more than 265,500 individual active angels (http://www.angelcapital
association.org), a better understanding of the factors inﬂuencing the positioning
and timing of the request for funding undoubtedly warrants interest. More
speciﬁcally, we ask: What are the factors that determine whether a venture is ready
for angel funding?
We address this question and frame our research around the concept of
‘readiness’. The concept of readiness has been used in the organizational behavior
literature, in work on strategic change and in research on the management of
technology. The organizational behavior literature investigates readiness relative to
organization members’ beliefs and attitudes about pending change and considers
factors that can catalyze or inﬂuence transformative change (Eby et al. 2000). In the
strategic change literature, the concept of readiness explains the extent to which
organization assets, processes and demonstrable activities indicate the organization
is ready to move from a current state to a new desired end state (Kaplan and
Norton 2004). Finally, the notion of technology readiness is deﬁned as an
individual’s readiness to accept or use new technology (Parasuraman 2000) or the
technology readiness for commercialization or transfer (Heslop, McGregor, and
Griﬃth 2001).
In the context of a new venture seeking funding from an angel or angel group,
a judgment about ‘readiness’ for funding is quite similar. The entrepreneur(s)
decide the new venture is ready to scale, and that they are ready to move the

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:34 03 February 2015

venture forward, despite the risks and uncertainty in the process. Similarly, the
angel investor(s) makes a determination as to the readiness of the venture to grow
based on the team, the operations and customer base, and skills and competencies
of the organization, and assesses the investment risk and returns. The angel
investor(s)’ assessment of the venture will determine the readiness to move to the
next level, and this is often based on the potential to scale the business, risk/returns
ratio, and time to exit (Sudek 2006; Wiltbank, Read, Dew and Sarasvathy 2009).
A study by Douglas and Shepherd (2002) elaborated the concept of investor
readiness, presenting three subareas of readiness, technology, market and
management. They concluded these can be aggregated to explain investor ratings
of readiness for funding. Importantly, the entrepreneurs’ perception of readiness to
scale and move forward may be quite diﬀerent from the investor’s perception of
readiness.
To better understand the readiness phenomenon, we used a dataset of 332 ﬁrms
that sought angel investment from the members of a prominent angel investment
group located outside of Boston, MA during 2007–2008. We organized our analysis
around the concept of organizational, strategic, and technology readiness. These
three aspects are quite similar to the general categories used in previous research,
namely characteristics of the start-up team, market and ﬁnancial characteristics of
the new venture, and characteristics of stage of technology development. These
measures parallel Douglas and Shepherd’s (2002) categorization. The rest of our
article is organized as follows. We ﬁrst discuss the concept of readiness, deriving a set
of hypotheses on the eﬀect of readiness in the angel investors’ decision-making
process. We next present our methodology and report the results from statistical
tests. We conclude by discussing the study’s implications and oﬀering suggestions for
future research.
Theory and hypotheses
Readiness
Readiness is ‘the state of being fully prepared for something’ (Dictionary.com 2011).
It is a concept which has been explored in several diﬀerent literatures, including
organizational behavior, strategic management, and management of technology. An
early consideration of organizational readiness, rooted in the strategic management
of human resources, deﬁnes it as availability or obtainabilty of skills, resources, and
leadership style to undergo succession in leadership or growth (Lengnick-Hall and
Lengnick-Hall 1988). These authors proposed a matrix whereby the conditions of
organizational strategy and human resources are formulated based on growth and
readiness for change to include the skills, styles, and experience of the organization
members. More recently, readiness has been used to investigate organization
members’ beliefs and attitudes about pending change, considering factors that can
catalyze or inﬂuence transformative change (Eby et al. 2000). Readiness for change
generally begins with an organization member’s perception of the beneﬁts of change,
perception of the risks of failing to change and perceived external demands of the
change (Armenakis et al. 1993; Prochaska et al. 1994). Self-eﬃcacy and conﬁdence in
coping with change as well as job characteristics also inﬂuence an individual
organization member’s perceived readiness (Armenakis et al. 1993; Prochaska et al.
1994). Some studies explore the extent to which organization members are ready to
move forward even though there are risks and beneﬁts to the change process

<-----Page 5----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:34 03 February 2015

C.G. Brush et al.

(Prochaska et al. 1994; Cunningham et al. 2002). Finally, the characteristics of the
organization and the structure and policies that are needed to support and reinforce
a climate conducive to change for the eﬀort to be successful have also been examined
(Eby et al. 2000; Lengnick-Hall and Lengnick-Hall 1988). In all, organizational
readiness for change has to do with the extent to which organization members
have the attitudes, experience, perceptions and conﬁdence to move forward with a
change.
Strategic readiness assesses how well prepared a company’s people, systems and
organizational culture is to carry out its strategy (Kaplan and Norton 2004). It is
argued that strategic readiness is deﬁned by the human, information and
organizational capital, or the intangible assets that are the foundation for strategic
change, which most often involves new markets, products or corporate transformation. Kaplan and Norton’s (2004) prescriptive piece provided a methodology for
assessing strategic readiness for change. Pennings and Harianto (1992) examined
technological innovation in the consumer banking industry from a corporate
entrepreneurship perspective. They concluded that continuous technical skill
development promoted readiness for strategic corporate venturing in the future.
Ash and Burn (2003) explored the management of internet-enabled ERP
applications in six international organizations. A key ﬁnding was that cultural
readiness, measured as low risk aversion, leadership and open communication, was
positively related to success. A key correlate of strategic readiness is urgency in terms
of time available to implement the needed strategic changes (Armenakis et al. 1993).
Other work examines levels of readiness, or the extent to which participants of an
organization are engaged and accepting of technical innovation and the extent to
which an organization has the infrastructure to move forward with a new strategy
(Jeannett et al., 2005). In sum, strategic readiness considers the extent to which the
organization’s structure and systems are ready for strategic change, growth, or
movement into new product/market arenas.
Technology readiness is diﬀerent from organizational and strategic change. In
one view, technology readiness is a measurement system that allows for comparison
of maturity between diﬀerent types of technology (Mankins 1995). This view points
out levels of development ranging from observation of basic principles, to
component or product validation in a lab, to validation in the relevant environment.
In a related research stream, researchers investigate the readiness of technology
commercialization and transfer by constructing a model of factors that lead to
success (Heslop, McGregor, and Griﬃth 2001). Referred to as a cloverleaf model,
four factors are deemed important; strength of technology, market attractiveness,
commercialization avenues and management support (Heslop, McGregor, and
Griﬃth 2001). Other research explores the psychological aspects of customer
reactions to company technologies in products and services (Parasuraman 2000).
This study created an index, Technology Readiness Index (TRI) which measures an
individual’s readiness to use new technology in general, using four personality traits:
optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity. Those with optimism and
innovativeness and little discomfort and insecurity were more likely to use a new
technology (Parasuraman 2000). Other work examines the role of human capital in
the role of technology diﬀusion across countries, whereby building skills and
capabilities at the individual level is a pre-requisite for technology development (Lee
2001). In sum, technology readiness has to do with the proof of concept and
acceptance of the innovation by a particular group.

Readiness and angel investment decision-making process
While there is a long tradition of research on angel investing, recent research has
begun to focus on the angel investment decision-making process. Much of that
research focused on developing and testing a set of criteria on which investors make
their funding decisions. Factors such as capitalization (Feeney, Haines, and Riding
1999; Mason and Harrison, 2000; Van Osnabrugge 2000), evidence of marketplace
acceptance (Bachher and Guild 1996; Sudek 2006), patent protection (Haar, Starr,
and MacMillan 1988; Mason and Harrison 1999) and human factors such as skills
(Van Osnabrugge 2000; Paul, Whittam, and Wyper 2007), industry experience
(Bachher and Guild 1996; Feeney, Haines, and Riding 1999; Sudek 2006) and track
record (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Sudek 2006; Smith, Harrison, and Mason 2010) have
been found to be signiﬁcantly associated with angel investment. Mason and Harrison
(2003) refer to the ‘investment ready’ concept, which is deﬁned as the venture’s state
of willingness or preparedness to take on a new investor. On the other hand, they
deﬁne ‘investability’ as the investor’s perception of management skills, business
model, market, growth perspective and other factors (Mason and Harrison 2004).
Clark (2008) extends this research by examining sets of softer skill sets such as
impression management, ﬁnding that some opportunities were not pursued based
on a poor presentation by the entrepreneur. In addition, Maxwell, Jeﬀery, and
Levesque (2011) examined over 150 interactions between entrepreneurs and potential
investors. They found that to make their initial business judgments, angels use a
shortcut heuristic to reduce the number of available investment opportunities.
We believe that an investigation of the concept of readiness from the perspective
of the new venture can enhance our understanding of the process of obtaining angel
ﬁnancing. When an entrepreneur(s) submits a proposal to an angel investment
group, he or she has made a determination that the venture is fully prepared, or
ready to grow. In terms of organizational readiness, this would mean that the new
venture is ready for change; in that it has a capable team with previous experience
and that the key management roles are ﬁlled (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000;
Wong 2002). Ventures showing strategic readiness would be those ventures that
already have an investment in the business and hence a stronger resource base
(Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 2002). Further, businesses operating in an attractive
market, and those having a track record of customers would also reﬂect strategic
readiness, as would the stage of the product development (Wong 2002). Technology
readiness would be characterized by those businesses that have intellectual property
(IP) that is protectable in some way (Harrison and Mason 1999). This inventory
follows the categorization oﬀered by Douglas and Shepherd (2002) who deﬁned
market readiness as having a tested concept, track record of sales, and market
research; management readiness as having appropriate business acumen, experience,
and fully formed management team; and technology readiness as having a tested
prototype, intellectual property, and a durable and reliable technology.
When an entrepreneur(s) applies for angel funding, he/she has decided that the
venture is organizationally, strategically and technologically ready for investment.
Research about angel investor decision-making suggests that in the proposal
screening stage, all three aspects of readiness would be important to passing the
screen (Sudek 2006). Hall and Hofer (1993) showed that VCs put more weight on
aspects of the opportunity during the screening stage, while Haar, Starr, and
MacMillan (1988) found that angels were interested in management’s ability and
market potential. Mason and Harrison (1999) found that the most common reasons

<-----Page 7----->116

for deal rejection were the state of the entrepreneurial team, marketing and ﬁnance,
resulting in the new ventures not being ‘investment ready’ (2003). Having a
management team or a revenue stream is an indication to potential investors that the
new venture has completed the initial research and development phases (Wong
2002). Hence, we suggest:
H1a: New ventures that are organizationally ready are more likely to pass the
administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H1b: New ventures which are strategically ready are more likely to pass the
administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H1c: New ventures which are technologically ready are more likely to pass the
administrative review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
Above, we posit that all three characteristics of readiness are necessary to move
the entrepreneurial new venture into the angel group decision-making process.
However, once the new venture passes the administrative review phase of the angel
investment decision-making process, we believe that the equal emphasis on all three
readiness characteristics shifts. As the new venture moves into the next phases of the
decision making process, the screening committee and then the entire angel group
reviews the new venture to determine the new venture’s readiness to be seriously
considered as an investment opportunity (Mason and Harrison 2003; Sudek 2006). It
is at this point that the decision-making criteria shifts from an emphasis on the whole
ﬁrm to a focus on the individual entrepreneur(s) and his or her organization, as ﬁrst
the screening committee and then the entire angel group conducts a more detailed
analysis to determine whether the new venture has potential to turn its proposed
product or service into a viable and proﬁtable business.
This focus on the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurial team is consistent with
long-standing research in the entrepreneurship literature. Early research by
MacMillan, Zemann, and SubbaNarashimha (1987) show that both angels and
VCs weigh the entrepreneur and new venture team (NVT) more heavily in the
investment decision than the opportunity and its market potential. Van Osnabrugge
and Robinson (2000) ﬁnd that entrepreneur enthusiasm and trustworthiness are top
criteria in determining funding, while Feeney, Haines, and Riding (1999) ﬁnds that
more active angel investors tend to focus on owner attributes as opposed to less
active angels who focus on business attributes. In a study of angel investors in
California, Sudek (2006) reported that the management team’s trust and enthusiasm
were top criteria in determining investment by. Similarly, Wong (2002) argued that
intangible factors such as entrepreneur’s prior experience may provide signals to
alleviate investor uncertainty. Further, investors may feel more secure investing with
entrepreneurs who have a previous track record of starting and growing a business.
Finally, Maxwell, Jeﬀery, and Levesque (2011) suggest that after the initial phase in
the angel investment process, decision heuristics are abandoned and angel investors
adopt a more complete and likely more subjective set of criteria to further evaluate
investment opportunities. Hence we hypothesize:
H2a. New ventures which are organizationally ready are more likely to pass the screening
committee review phase of the angel investment decision-making process.
H2b. New ventures which are organizationally ready are more likely to pass the
presentation phase of the angel investment decision-making process.

Methodology

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:34 03 February 2015

Data collection and coding procedure
Data for the study came from the investment proposals (N ¼ 332) submitted to a
large angel ﬁnancing group located in the Northeast over a two-year period (2007–
2008). The ﬁrms applying for angel funding were new and small ventures, which were
on average less than ﬁve years old (mean ¼ 4.83 years) and had fewer than 10
employees (mean ¼ 9.86). About half of them (47%) operated in the technology
sector of the economy and almost two-thirds (63.76%) came from New England.
The angel group had a four-step decision process. The investment proposal was
reviewed by an administrative committee which made a decision to ‘desk reject’ the
proposal or to move it on to a screening committee presentation. Ventures successful
in passing the screening presentation were invited to present to the larger group of
investors. Those successful at the large group presentation were in turn able to enter
the due diligence process. The angel group provided us with the pool of investment
proposals submitted over the period, the desk reject decisions, screening committee
decisions and outcome of the formal presentations. The investment proposals were
between one and ﬁve pages in length and oﬀered detailed information about the
qualiﬁcations of the founding team, the nature of the business, the amount of capital
sought, cash ﬂow, and the intended use of the funds, as well as a variety of additional
product, intellectual property, market, and ﬁnancial projections (Figure 1).
To generate the dataset, two trained research assistants independently coded the
investment proposals, following a speciﬁc coding scheme developed by the principal
investigators which consisted of 64 categories. We then calculated inter-rater
reliability, implementing the kappa procedure in STATA, and utilized the linear
weighted Cohen’s Kappa statistics for the ordinal categories. The percent agreement
across the coding categories ranged between 76.19% and 91.30%, well above the
recommended 0.70 threshold (Stemler 2004). Coding inconsistencies, which occurred
infrequently, were resolved by one of the three coauthors.
Measures
The dependent variable for this study was a four-level ordinal variable which
captured whether the angel group decision was to ‘desk reject’ the proposal, accept

Figure 1.

the proposal for screening, accept the screened proposal for presentation, and accept
the presented proposal for due diligence. More speciﬁcally, if the new venture was
desk-rejected, the outcome of the angel investment process was coded as ‘0’; if the
new venture passed the desk-rejection stage, the outcome was coded as ‘1’, if the new
venture passed the ‘small group’ screening presentation and was invited for a
presentation in front of the larger group, the outcome was coded as ‘2’, and if the
new venture passed the ‘big group presentation’ and was moved to due diligence, the
outcome was coded as ‘3’.
Organizational readiness was captured by three variables: the number of employees
of the new venture (self-reported), the number of people on the top management team
(calculated as the tally of managers listed in the proposal) and the top management
team’s industry experience (extracted from the ‘Management’ section of the proposal
and coded as ‘1’ if the team had industry experience and ‘0’ otherwise). Strategic
readiness was captured by four self-reported variables: a binary measure of whether
or not the company had current customers, an ordinal measure of the level of new
product development (‘concept’, coded as ‘1’, ‘prototype’, coded as ‘2’. ‘product in
development’, coded as ‘3’, ‘product ready’, coded as ‘4’, and ‘revenue generated
from sale of product’, coded as ‘5’), expected revenues in 2009, and the new venture’s
pre-money valuation. Finally, technological readiness was captured by a binary
measure that reﬂected whether or not the new venture had intellectual property in
the form of a patent or patent-pending technology, trademark, or proprietary
technology. The variable was extracted from the ‘Competitive Advantage’ section of
the investment proposal.
We controlled for industry and ﬁrm-level factors which prior empirical research
has found to impact the angel ﬁnancing process. At the industry level, we controlled
for the eﬀect of technology and medical sectors compared to the consumer goods
sector. At the ﬁrm level, we controlled for a business-to-consumer business model,
location (whether or not the venture was located in Massachusetts, other New
England states, or outside of New England), as well as the monthly net cash burn,
capital already raised, and the amount of capital sought. Descriptive statistics and
correlations are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
We calculated the variance-inﬂation factors (VIF) for all variables entered in
the regression estimations. These ranged from 1.2 to 1.8, far below the threshold
VIF-level of 10, reassuring us that multicollinearity was not a concern for our
statistical analysis. To remedy potential over-dispersion, we log-transformed six
variables (number of employees, expected revenues in 2009, pre-money valuation,
monthly net cash burn, capital already raised, and amount of capital sought) prior to
entering them in the seqlogit estimation.
Statistical procedure
To test for the eﬀect of factors that determine the progress of the new venture
through the subsequent rounds of the angel ﬁnancing process, we implemented the
sequential logit (seqlogit) procedure in Stata. This model estimates the eﬀect of the
explanatory variables on the probabilities of passing a set of transitions. The user
can specify any decision tree as long as each level of the dependent variable can be
reached though one and only one sequence of transitions (Buis 2007). In our case,
the new venture passes through a series of eliminations: desk-rejection, small-group
screening, and outcome of the presentation to the larger angel investment group.

Since each stage (level) of the outcome can be reached though one and only one
sequence of transitions, seqlogit is an appropriate statistical technique. Compared to
a simple logit analysis, sequential logit acknowledges that the entire choice set is not
considered simultaneously. On the other hand, once we know the highest achieved
stage of the investment decision, we can reconstruct the entire progression of the
new venture through the investment process. By assigning values of the dependent
variable that correspond to the progress of the cases through the series of sequential
eliminations (transitions), we are able to keep all cases in the statistical analysis
(Neter et al. 1996).
Sequential logit is a model of nested dichotomies and can be estimated simply by
specifying a number of logit models. As with any choice model, sequential logit
assumes that (1) the observations of the dependent variable have been randomly
sampled from the population of interest; (2) the dependent variable is caused by or
associated with the independent variables, while the independent variables are
determined by inﬂuences (variables) ‘outside’ the model; and (3) there is uncertainty
in the relation between the dependent and independent variables as reﬂected in the
scattering of observations around the functional relationship (Greene 2011).
Compared to a regular linear regression model, the maximum likelihood estimation
of the logit model oﬀers the advantage of being robust to non-normal error terms,
non-constant error variance, and the constraints on the response function stemming
from the binary (nonlinear) nature of the dependent variable (Neter et al. 1996).
The statistical output shows the estimated eﬀect of the explanatory variables
on the likelihood of passing through each sequence of transitions speciﬁed in the
decision tree. The eﬀect is reported as an ‘odds’ ratio (together with the
corresponding standard errors), or the ratio of the odds of an event occurring in
one group to the odds of it occurring in another group, or to a sample-based estimate
of that ratio. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the condition or event under study is
equally likely to occur in both groups. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates a
positive eﬀect of the explanatory/control variable, whereas an odds ratio less than 1
indicates a negative relationship.
Results
The results from the sequential logit estimation (Table 3) suggest that at the ﬁrst
transition (desk-rejection), one of the three measures of organizational readiness (the
size of the top management team) signiﬁcantly increases the odds of passing through
this elimination stage. Thus, Hypothesis 1a receives partial support. Two of the four
measures of strategic readiness (presence of current customers and stage of product
development) are signiﬁcantly and positively associated with the odds of passing
through the desk-rejection stage, whereas the expected revenues in 2009 show a
signiﬁcant and negative relationship. Thus, Hypothesis 1b receives mixed support.
Intellectual property, a measure of technological readiness, signiﬁcantly improves
the odds of passing through the desk-rejection stage. Thus, Hypothesis 1c is
supported.
At the second transition sequence (‘Small Group Presentation’), the size of the
top management team is signiﬁcantly and negatively associated with the likelihood
of passing through this stage. None of the measures of organizational readiness are
signiﬁcantly associated with the odds of passing through the third transition (‘Big
Group Presentation’). Thus, Hypotheses 2a and 2b fail to receive support. From the

control variables, location was a signiﬁcant factor throughout all transition
sequences speciﬁed in the model. Being located in Massachusetts or other New
England states signiﬁcantly improved the odds of passing the desk-rejection,
screening, and big group presentation stage of the investment process.
Discussion
Changing investment criteria
Our list of investment criteria used by early stage investors is similar to that found in
other studies. In considering the factors inﬂuencing likelihood of moving past the
desk reject stage, we had partial support for organizational and strategic readiness
and full support for technology readiness. The partial support for organizational
readiness follows previous work ﬁnding the importance of human factors such as
skills (Van Osnabrugge 2000; Paul, Whittam, and Wyper 2007). The partial support
for strategic readiness on the angel’s decision to move is in line with studies by Haar,
Starr, and MacMillan (1988) and Wong (2002). The full support for our hypothesis
about the importance of technological readiness (which we operationalized as the
existence of intellectual property protection) follows past research as well (Haar,
Starr, and MacMillan 1988; Mason and Harrison 1999). This suggests that our

123

research provides important empirical validation to the ﬁndings of other studies on
early stage investors. On the other hand, our predictions regarding the primacy of
organizational readiness in the screening and full presentation stages did not hold
up. While previous research emphasizes the importance of the qualities of the
entrepreneur (Feeney, Haines, and Riding 1999; Wong 2002; Sudek 2006), it appears
that other factors make more of a diﬀerence. Given previous research both in
venture capital and angel investing, it can be expected that the entrepreneur(s)’
presentation and social skills will also be important (Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron
2004; Clark 2008).
While we are encouraged by the convergence of our ﬁndings relative to prior
work on angel investing, it is apparent that the criteria seemed to change as new
ventures went through the angel investment decision-making process. Initially, at the
administrative review leading to accept or desk reject, it was tangible and often
quantiﬁable decision-making criteria that were signiﬁcant. This suggests that for the
administrative review, there is a set of criteria that the administrative team is looking
for, and if the ﬁrm meets many of those, then they are moved forward in the process.
One example, with respect to organizational readiness, is that the variable ‘size of the
top management team’ was highly signiﬁcant. When we look more closely at this
measure of readiness, it is clear this is an easily quantiﬁable measure. In addition,
if angels use the size of the top management team as an indication of whether or not
the key management roles are ﬁlled (Van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000; Wong
2002), then the administrative team making the move forward/desk reject decision
has a quick litmus test of both the entrepreneur and the organizational capability of
the new venture.
As we looked at the data for the ﬁrms who were successful in making it through
screening and into the formal presentation, we noticed that the decision criterion for
advancing to subsequent stages is diﬀerent. No longer were control variables such as
Business to Consumer (B to C), and the amount of capital sought, organizational
variables such as the size of the management team, strategic variables such as current
customers, stage of product development and pre-money valuation and technological variables such as intellectual property, signiﬁcant. Thus, the size of the top
management team has a signiﬁcant and positive eﬀect at the desk-rejection stage, but
a signiﬁcant and negative eﬀect at the small group presentation stage. Intellectual
property signiﬁcantly improved the odds of passing through the ﬁrst two
eliminations, but had no signiﬁcant eﬀect during the big group presentation. On
the other hand, the stage of new product development had a positive eﬀect during
initial eliminations and the ﬁnal presentation, but not during the small group
presentations. All of this statistical evidence suggests that as the new venture moves
through the subsequent decision phases, tangible, objective criteria cease to be the
consistent drivers of angel decision making. It is plausible to surmise, then, that
intangible, subjective criteria would increase in importance. As the angel investors
increase their level of scrutiny, they start to look for less quantiﬁable intangibles,
such as the trustworthiness (Sudek 2006), commitment (Erikson 2001), persuasiveness (Mason and Harrison 2003) and passion (Chen, Yao, and Kotha 2009; Sudek,
Miteness, and Cardon 2009) of the top management team. This supports ﬁndings by
Wiltbank, Sudek, and Read (2010) who found that as entrepreneurs move forward
with potential investors, less importance is based on predictive factors and more
importance is based on the non-predictive factors such as execution, ability to
deliver, and ability to inﬂuence the market. Further, this raises questions about the

<-----Page 15----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:34 03 February 2015

124

C.G. Brush et al.

role of perceptions and how this may inﬂuence the angel investor evaluation (Sudek
2006) and the ability of the entrepreneur(s) to manage impressions or perceptions
(Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron 2004; Mason and Harrison 2003). This line of
thinking explains the puzzling negative eﬀect of the expected future revenues. It
appears angel investors would rather see a cautious and prudent entrepreneur and
are negatively impressed by unrealistically high revenue projections. Anecdotally, in
conversations about how angels assess whether or not a new venture is ‘investmentready’, one angel investor commented in particular on the importance of criteria
such as ‘tactical readiness’ – or the ability of the top management team to execute the
strategic plan, and ‘ﬁt’ readiness, or the ﬁt between the new venture and the
competencies, expertise, and performance expectations of the angel group.
Therefore, we suggest that at the ﬁrst stage of consideration where the group
administrative team makes ‘accept or desk-reject’ decisions, readiness is comprised
of tangible, objective investment criteria. In other words, this is consistent with the
purpose of the initial screen which is to rule out the ‘no hopers’ in order to focus time
and opportunity on those that might have more potential (Smith, Harrison, and
Mason 2010). However, as the ﬁrm moves through the angel investment decision
making process, readiness takes on less tangible and more subjective dimensions
which may be more observable in the entrepreneur(s)’ presentation. The lack of
signiﬁcance for team size or experience over other aspects of readiness suggests that
social skills such as impression management, persuasiveness, ability to think on your
feet, to answer questions and to listen to advice may outweigh the measurable
factors (Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron 2004; Clark 2008). Further, the role of self
conﬁdence and self perception as it is associated with readiness is of interest given
that entrepreneurs seeking equity funding perceive themselves as more persuasive
than outside evaluators (Hoehn-Weiss, Brush and Baron 2004). Importantly, the
entrepreneur’s internally-driven perception of new venture readiness may signiﬁcantly diverge from the angel’s external perception of readiness.
The importance of location of the new venture in all of the phases of the angel
investment decision-making process
While our ﬁndings suggest that the investment criterion changes as new ventures
progress through the angel investment decision-making process, the importance of
location remains constant. This does support previous ﬁndings suggesting that
location is important at the time of investment because angels serving on the board
would like to have the venture accessible (Mason and Rogers 1997). However, from
the perspective of early stage readiness assessment, this is signiﬁcant at the
submission stage. In other words, just to pass the desk reject stage, location becomes
an aspect of consideration. New ventures that are seeking angel investments are in
the very early stages of development. They typically have exhausted their initial
sources of capital, which often comes from friends and family, but are not ready for
the large capital infusions provided by professional venture capital ﬁrms. Empirical
evidence suggests that at this stage of development, ﬁrms search locally for
additional sources of capital (Wong 2002). Private angel investors who are willing
to invest in early stage ventures often form a localized bond of trust with the
management of the new venture, which decreases the necessity for formal control
mechanisms such as board seats and staged investment (Smith, Harrison, and Mason
2010). However, in the absence of a formal control mechanism, informal monitoring

<-----Page 16----->Venture Capital

125

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:34 03 February 2015

becomes increasingly important as angel investors seek to closely monitor the
progress of the new venture.
In addition to providing essential venture funding, angel investors are also
known for their willingness to get involved in the new venture, either by joining the
management team or by giving advice to the entrepreneurs. These ‘non-ﬁnancial
motives’ are a very strong secondary consideration for becoming a business angel,
as it is well known that business angels seek to contribute their experience and
knowledge to their investments (Mason and Harrison, 2000). Given that the desire to
be involved in the entrepreneurial process is an important reason why private
investors choose to become angels, location of the new venture becomes critical.
Implications and conclusions
The objective of this article was to use the concept of readiness to explore the new
ventures readiness for funding by angel investors. Drawing from literatures of
organizational, strategic and technological readiness, we studied the extent to which
new ventures exhibit aspects of these types of readiness at the point of seeking
funding, and the extent to which these are more or less important. Organizational
readiness for change has to do with the extent to which organization members have
the attitudes, experience, perceptions, and conﬁdence to move forward with a
change, while strategic readiness concerns the extent to which an organization’s
structure and systems are ready for growth or movement into new product/market
arenas, and technology readiness has to do with the proof of concept and acceptance
of the innovation by a particular group. These three dimensions make up overall
‘readiness’ and capture the three subcategories of market, technology and management readiness, noted by Douglas and Shepherd (2002). Our ﬁndings show that
technology readiness made the biggest diﬀerence in whether or not the venture
moved through the screening process, with organizational and strategic readiness
being less signiﬁcant in our analysis. Technology readiness is more easily measurable
in terms of the type and protectability of the technology (i.e. prototype, intellectual
property) as well as customer acceptance (i.e. sales) (Mason and Harrison 1999;
Heslop, McGregor, and Griﬃth 2001). Further, strategic and organizational
readiness were less important in our analysis and more diﬃcult to measure because
of their intangible nature (i.e. systems, infrastructure, culture, and participants skills,
style and experience) (Lengnick-Hall and Lengnick-Hall 1988; Van Osnabrugge
2000). The comparative lack of signiﬁcance of organizational and strategic readiness
at the early stages of funding consideration in this context might be in part explained
by a lack of data to measure the ﬁner points of these aspects. For instance, the extent
to which the ﬁrm is strategically ready for funding is not necessarily apparent in the
business plan or even in the presentation by the entrepreneur(s) to the angel group.
Organizational readiness, or employee, staﬀ and management capabilities for
funding and growth, is not readily observable, either. Future research should
consider these dimensions in order to fully capture the combined aspects of readiness
for investment (Douglas and Shepherd, 2002).
Our ﬁndings suggest that even though entrepreneurs may believe they are ready
for funding in reality they might be driven more by a sense of urgency than readiness.
Readiness is perceptual on the part of both the investor and the entrepreneur, and as
this research illustrates, what the entrepreneur deems as an organization ready for
outside funding may be very diﬀerent from what the angel investor perceives.

<-----Page 17----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:34 03 February 2015

C.G. Brush et al.

Because of this gap in perception, there are a few things that the entrepreneur can do
to ensure that they are ready to move into the angel process. Given the importance
of objective decision-making criteria in the ﬁrst round of decision making,
entrepreneurs seeking angel ﬁnancing should at a minimum, make sure they are
technologically, organizationally and strategically ready. What this means is that
they must have some sort of intellectual property (patent pending, patent,
trademark), they must have a more fully formed management team with experience,
they should have a product in the advanced stages of development, as well as some
established customer base (Douglas and Shepherd 2002; Sudek 2006). In addition,
they should have realistic projections about the amount of capital they are seeking.
Without these baseline ﬁrm development conditions, they will not have a chance of
making it to the screening stage. For ventures with smaller entrepreneurial teams,
higher cash burn, fewer customers, initial stages of product development and lack of
intellectual property, the urgency for funding may be great and they may apply for
angel funding too early, and hence be desk rejected.
Importantly, our ﬁndings suggest that those entrepreneurs who make it past the
screening stage need to pay attention to intangible factors. Readiness at this stage is
not the same as urgency for funding, or having the base line factors such as a fully
ﬂedged top management team (organizational), customers and a developed product
(strategic) or intellectual property (technological). Instead, the components of
readiness include other intangibles as perceived by angels, such as the conﬁdence in
the ability to execute a chosen strategy, the passion and persuasion demonstrated in
the formal presentation, or the perceived ﬁt with the priorities of the angel
investment group. Therefore, entrepreneur(s) should spend time learning about the
biases and subjective considerations of angel investors prior to attending a face-toface screening session. Finally, the importance of location as a discriminating factor
between those that move past desk rejection stage suggests that entrepreneur(s) need
to carefully consider when submitting outside their geographic area. The risk of desk
rejection may increase proportionately to the distance from the angel group location.
While we are conﬁdent in the robustness of our ﬁndings, there are a number of
limitations to this study. Our data are based solely on the information provided to
the angel group by the entrepreneur. It does not include information that would be
uncovered in later stages of the investment decision-making process. In addition,
because of the often conﬁdential and anonymous nature of the angel investment
process, we had no access to information about the actual funding of the new
ventures that successfully passed the ‘big group presentation’ stage and were selected
for due diligence. However, our plan is to collect these data by survey in the future.
Therefore, while we believe that our insigniﬁcant ﬁndings for the second set of
hypotheses are because the decision-making criteria may have changed, we need
additional data collection to verify that contention. Future research could employ
diﬀerent data collection techniques, such as interviews and discourse analysis, which
explore the entire decision-making process so we can better understand the shifts in
emphasis at each stage of decision-making. The data are also limited to one angel
group located on the east coast of the United States. Research has indicated possible
diﬀerences in investment patterns between east and west coast angel groups. Future
research could include angels from other areas so that we could see if our ideas hold
in diﬀerent settings. Finally, data for this research were collected in 2007–2008.
For the most part, this was before the current recession. What eﬀects the recession
has had on private equity investing are not likely to be captured in these data.

Combining the data with information from the time-period of the recession would
allow us to capture the eﬀects of broad economic changes on the angel investment
process.
Limitations notwithstanding, this article oﬀers a preliminary examination of the
readiness concept in the angel investment process by phase. We break the decision
making process up into well deﬁned decision stages, to give us a ﬁner-grained
analysis of the process. We ﬁnd that all aspects of readiness are important at the ﬁrst,
administrative decision making juncture but that these tangible embodiments of
readiness fade in importance as the new venture moves through the decision making
process. Interestingly, however, the location of the new venture remains consistently
important; suggesting that while other criteria may change, access to the new venture
remains of paramount importance to the angel investor. Future research that collects
data from all of the stages of the decision-making process would enhance our
understanding of the angel investment process.
