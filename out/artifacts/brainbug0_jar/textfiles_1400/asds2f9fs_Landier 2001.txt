Abstract
I develop a model in which entrepreneurs and investors can hold-up each
other once the venture is under way: investors can deny further funding, and
entrepreneurs can withdraw from the venture. The entrepreneurs’ exit option
determines which party needs protection. If the exit option is good, venture
capital financing protects the investor through technological monitoring, control
rights, and staged financing. If the exit option is bad, bank debt protects the
entrepreneur as it involves little technological monitoring, limited control rights,
and committed finance. The exit option depends on the legal environment
and on the stigma of failure, endogenized in a career concern model. When
entrepreneurs can choose project risk, multiple equilibria arise with diﬀerent
financial institutions. Venture capital prevails in the high-risk equilibrium and
bank debt in the low-risk equilibrium. The paper investigates why the forms
of start-up financing diﬀer across sectors, regions and countries. It oﬀers an
explanation for why venture capital has been more prevalent in the US than in
Europe. The theory has implications for policy, e.g., regarding the eﬃciency of
non-compete agreements and bankruptcy law.

Introduction

Venture capital has emerged as the most common form of financing for high-technology
start-ups in the US and is frequently referred to as an important factor in the technological leadership of the US economy. This form of financing diﬀers from standard
bank finance in three major dimensions.1 First, venture capitalists use their high level
of expertise to perform technological monitoring and to actively manage the companies they finance. Second, the capital infusions in the firms financed by venture
capital are staged in several rounds. Third, venture capitalists usually have extensive
control rights (e.g., board rights, voting rights). This form of financing is in contrast
with standard bank debt: banks traditionally perform accounting monitoring but no
technological monitoring and, outside default, their control is limited to assets used
as collateral.
In Europe, the venture capital industry remains small and focusses primarily on
financing buyouts rather than on early and expansion-stage financing. Moreover,
European venture capitalists are less “hands-on” (they rarely play an active role in
the management of the companies they finance) and have less control rights than
their American counterparts. Such diﬀerences in financing also exist within the US.
Saxenian (1994) provides evidence that venture capitalists in Massachusetts are less
involved in management and behave more like bankers than in Silicon Valley. In this

<-----Page 2----->paper, I investigate the source of these variations in financing forms. I formalize the
idea that these variations are related to diﬀerences in the exit option of entrepreneurs,
which aﬀect their bargaining power.
Entrepreneurs and investors can hold up each other once the venture is under way:
investors can deny further funding, and entrepreneurs can withdraw from the venture.
The optimal form of financing balances the terms of bargaining. The entrepreneurs’
exit option determines which party needs protection.
If the exit option is bad, the entrepreneur needs to be protected from ex-post
appropriation of rents by the investor. This goal is achieved by standard bank debt,
as it involves little technological monitoring, limited control rights, and committed
finance. Infusing a large amount of cash at the beginning solves two problems. First,
the entrepreneur behaves eﬃciently, maximizing the value of the project, and second,
the probability that refinancing is needed is small, relaxing the hold-up problem.
If the exit option is good, the investor needs to be protected. Venture capital financing meets this goal through technological monitoring, control rights, and staged
financing. The investor acquires technological expertise, allowing him to perform
technological monitoring, which increases the liquidation value of the firm if the entrepreneur withdraws. The optimal initial infusion of cash in this context is smaller,
reflecting the trade-oﬀ between incentives and the ex-post hold-up. The entrepreneur
cannot commit to high repayments. The level of repayments can be decreased by
lowering the first cash-infusion. The cost of this form of financing are twofold. First
the lower initial infusion decreases the incentives of the entrepreneur to act eﬃciently.
The second cost is the investor’s technological expertise. Both costs lower the ex ante
value of a given project.
Variations in the outside option of entrepreneurs have two sources. First, they
are related to the legal environment. We show how changes in bankruptcy rules
aﬀect financial institutions and contracts. Second, and perhaps more interestingly,
the outside option depends on the stigma associated with failure in entrepreneurial
ventures. This “stigma of failure” is endogenized by formalizing the relationship
between a project’s risk and the “stigma of failure”. The success of a given project
3

<-----Page 3----->depends on luck and ability. Ex ante entrepreneurs do not have information on their
ability. The more “normal” it is for a good entrepreneur to fail, the lower the stigma
of failure and therefore the stronger the bargaining position of the entrepreneur.
When entrepreneurs can choose between risky high growth projects and safer lowgrowth projects, two types of equilibria are possible and can coexist under certain
conditions. The riskiness of the strategies of other entrepreneurs determines in equilibrium the extent of the stigma of failure and, therefore, aﬀects the trade-oﬀ between
growth and risk that a given entrepreneur faces. This interaction can lead to multiple
equilibria and explain cross-country (e.g. Europe vs. US) or cross-regional diﬀerences
(e.g. Route 128 vs. Silicon valley) that have been so far described as the result of
exogenous diﬀerences in corporate culture.
In the low risk equilibrium, entrepreneurs choose safe strategies. If their ability is
high, they are relatively unlikely to fail. Therefore, the pool of failed entrepreneurs is
of relatively low quality, making the stigma of failure high. This reduces the need for
expertise on the investor’s side because the fear of being forced to default on the debt
payment enforces the entrepreneur’s discipline. As a consequence, the optimal form
of financing looks more like bank debt. In turn, the high stigma of failure makes safe
strategies ex ante the most attractive choice.
On the contrary, in the high-risk equilibrium, entrepreneurs choose aggressive
growth strategies. This means that even entrepreneurs with high ability are likely
to fail. Therefore, the pool of failed entrepreneurs is of high quality, leading to a
low stigma of failure. This tilts the hold-up problem in a direction favorable to the
entrepreneur. Therefore the optimal form of financing looks like venture capital, with
high investor expertise and investment staging. The ineﬃciencies that arise due to
the hold-up problem increase the cost of capital. In turn, due to the low stigma of
failure, the risky strategy is the most attractive.
Which equilibrium is the most eﬃcient depends on the trade-oﬀ between growth
and hold-up ineﬃciencies: if the value of high-risk projects is large enough, it oﬀsets the costs generated by the technological monitoring, and therefore, the high-risk
equilibrium is the most eﬃcient one.
4

<-----Page 4----->This paper is related to two strands of literature. The first is the career concern
literature initiated by Holmstrom (1982, 1999) where managers are concerned by how
their reputation will be aﬀected their actions. Second, this paper is related to the large
literature on the principal-agent problem in financial contracting. Grossman and Hart
(1986) and Hart and Moore (1990) build a theory of incomplete contracting under
renegotiation and study how the nature of the hold-up problem aﬀects contracting.
Aghion and Bolton (1992) show how the dissociation between control rights and cashflow rights can decrease ineﬃciencies due to the ex post misalignment of objectives of
entrepreneurs and investors. Rajan (1992) considers the trade-oﬀ between informed
and non-informed finance in a set-up where ineﬃciencies arise due to the threat of
termination of informed creditors. Specifically related to our topic, Gompers (1995)
shows empirically that venture capitalists concentrate investment in early-stage and
high technology companies where informational asymmetries are highest, and that
financing rounds become more frequent when the intangibility of assets is higher.
Several papers model the relationship between a venture capitalist and an investor,
such as Berglof (1994) or Repullo and Suarez (2000). Hellmann (1998) has a model
where control rights protect the investor from hold-up from the entrepreneur. These
models do not link investment staging with hold-up and the misalignment between the
two parties is due to private benefits (as opposed to endogenous career concerns in our
model). The main contribution of my model is to oﬀer a capital market equilibrium
perspective to the problem of the conflict between creditors and entrepreneurs: The
hold-up and moral-hazard problems to which an entrepreneur is subject depend both
on financial institutions and on the choices of other entrepreneurs that prevail in
equilibrium. Gromb and Scharfstein (2001) have a model of entrepreneurship where
managerial incentives are determined by the career prospects in the event of a project’s
failure which in turn depends on the type of organization where the project failed
(intrapreneurial vs. entrepreneurial). Managers who fail an internal venture can be
redeployed by their firms into other jobs which has costs in terms of incentives whereas
failed entrepreneurs must seek employment at other firms. Incentive problems depend
the organizational choice of firms and, like in my model, on the equilibrium of the
labor market. While their focus is on whether projects are done inside or outside large
5

<-----Page 5----->firms, my model focusses on financing institutions and project choice for start-ups.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the benchmark model and
solves for the equilibrium. Section 3 endogenizes the stigma of failure. Section 4
discusses the cross-sectorial implications of the model. Section 5 studies the conditions
for multiple equilibria to arise and discusses their relative eﬃciency. Section 6 presents
two case studies comparing the level and nature of venture-capital finance in Europe
vs. the US and Silicon Valley vs. Route 128 respectively. Section 7 concludes. All
mathematical proofs are in the appendix.

A Model of Start-up Financing

In this section I present a simple model of start-up finance. The model endogenizes the
staging of investment as the solution to an optimal contracting problem. I characterize
investors by their level of expertise. Bank finance corresponds to a non-expert investor
and a unique infusion of funds. Venture capital corresponds to an expert investor and
a positive probability for more than one round of cash infusion to occur.

2.1

Model

The model has four periods, t = 0, 1, 2, 3. All agents are risk-neutral. There is no
discounting. The main trade-oﬀ that we capture is the one between the costs of
technological monitoring and the time-inconsistent incentives of the entrepreneur to
minimize costs and repay debt.
At t = 0, there is a continuum of mass one of wealthless entrepreneurs, each
with a project generating a cash-flow V at t = 3. Each entrepreneur matches with a
competitive investor with whom he enters a contract. The contract specifies a cash
injection at t = 0, I0 , a final repayment D to the investor, and a level of expertise
of the investor H > 0. Expertise H has a unit cost γ.The role of the investor’s
expertise in our model is to aﬀect the terms of bargaining.2 A higher H increases the
2

We could assume that H also aﬀects the surplus (V ), therefore providing another motive for
investor’s expertise. We want to isolate the impact of H on the hold-up problem.

6

<-----Page 6----->firm value to the investor if the entrepreneur leaves, V (H) where V (H) is increasing
concave, V 0 (0) = +∞ and limH→∞ V (H) < V . Concretely, H is the eﬀective control
of the investor on the project: it represents both the ability of the investor to process
technological information relevant for pursuing the project (technological expertise)
and the possibility to have access to this information (control rights).
At t = 1, the entrepreneur and the investor observe whether the entrepreneur
is competent to undertake the project. If he is not (this happens with probability
p), the project is liquidated, at a value normalized to zero. If he is competent, the
entrepreneur chooses privately a level of eﬀort e, at private cost e2 /4.
At t = 2, the cost C of the project is revealed. C, which is observable to both the
investor and the entrepreneur, but not contractible.C is a random variable, distributed
uniformly on [0, 2C(e)], where C(e) is a decreasing, convex function of eﬀort e. We
also assume that −1/C(e) is convex and that continuation is eﬃcient for all levels

of e. The investment C is spent on the project’s execution (if I0 < C, the investor
makes the complementary injection I1 = C − I0 ), after which a payoﬀ V is produced.
At t = 3, the entrepreneur’s career goes on. The expectations of the labor market
only depend on whether he was successful or not on his first venture. He receives a
wage equal to his expected productivity: wf if he failed and ws if he succeeded, with
ws > wf . (The next section endogenizes wf and ws ). We note ∆ = ws − wf , the

stigma of failure.

2.2

First-Best

The first-best levels of eﬀort e and expertise H are determined by the maximization
of the surplus:
max(1 − p)[V − C(e) − e2 /2] − γH
e,H

Therefore, the first-best levels are:
½

0
H? =
e? = −C 0 (e? )

The optimal level of expertise is zero, reflecting the fact that H is costly and does
7

<-----Page 7----->not increase the surplus in the absence of market ineﬃciencies. The wages ws and
wf have no impact on the first-best values of eﬀort and expertise. This won’t be the
case any more in the presence of contracting ineﬃciencies.

2.3

Hold-up

We now depart from the first-best world by introducing a contract incompleteness:
we assume that each party can hold-up the other at t = 2. The investor can force
renegotiation when more cash needs to be infused at t = 2, and the entrepreneur can
always force renegotiation by threatening to quit the project. We assume symmetric
Nash-bargaining.
If the investor does not inject the cash required for the project at t = 2, the project
stops and the entrepreneur gets wf , namely the wage of a failed entrepreneur3 . The
value functions of the entrepreneur (E), and of the investor (I), when renegotiation
occurs are:
½

E = wf + 12 (V + ws − V (H) − wf )
I = V (H) + 12 (V + ws − V (H) − wf )

Remark that E + I = V + ws , which is the surplus from continuation and that the
terms of bargaining do not depend on how much cash has to be reinjected. In what
follows, we call ∆ = ws − wf , the “stigma of failure”. We can rewrite the outcome of

the bargaining as follows:
½

E = ws + 12 (V − V (H) − ∆)
I = V (H) + 12 (V − V (H) + ∆)

This shows that, ceteris paribus, an increase of the stigma of failure (∆), improves
the bargaining position of the investor. When ∆ is large, the main problem tends
to be investor’s ability to appropriate rents ex post if he has the power to do so.
Conversely, for a small ∆, the main problem tends to be the entrepreneur’s threat to
leave the firm.
3

To be precise, we assume that the market only observes if the project has been successfully
completed or not, i.e. if V has been produced. The market has no information on the reasons why
V “did not happen”.

8

<-----Page 8----->There is an asymmetry between these two commitment problems. The threat
of rent appropriation by the investor can be remedied by injecting more cash (or
equivalently oﬀering a deeper line of credit) at the beginning, which reduces the
states of the world where the entrepreneur has to ask for further funding. Absent
default, the investor does not have control and can not threat the entrepreneur. Such
a solution, however, does not exist for the entrepreneur’s commitment problem.

2.4

The Optimal Contract

We look for the optimal contract. In addition to the hold-up assumption, we assume
that entrepreneurs cannot credibly pledge the future incomes that they will get at
t = 3 from the labor-market. We also assume perfect accounting monitoring: the
entrepreneur cannot divert cash injected by the investor outside the firm until the
completion of the project. This implies that when the entrepreneur is incompetent,
the investor gets all his investment I0 back because the entrepreneur does not have
any bargaining power4 : he cannot steal money and if he leaves, the investor gets
everything back. Last, we assume that continuation is always eﬃcient at t = 2.
Therefore it is not possible for the investor to commit to terminate the project.
Each time an additional injection of cash is needed, i.e. I0 > C, the sharing of the
payoﬀ is determined by the Nash-bargaining solution. The reason is that for any other
sharing rule, one of the two parties would find it attractive to renegotiate. It follows
that the only case where the sharing rule can be diﬀerent from the bargaining solution
is the case where the first injection of cash can cover the costs (I0 > C) and the
entrepreneur prefers to repay his debt rather than renegotiate (ws + V + I0 − C − D >

E). In this case, the investor would like to renegotiate but cannot force renegotiation,
since the survival of the firm does not rely on him injecting more cash.
When E is low enough, it is possible to implement the first-best by a simple
debt contract: the investor does not invest in expertise, (H = 0), an injection of
I0 = 2C(e? ) is made at the beginning. As long as the repayment level D? required
4
We could alternatively assume that the entrepreneur can threaten to burn the cash inside the
firm and can therefore extract ∆/2. This would however lead to a mechanical relation between the
risk of the project and ineﬃciency.

9

<-----Page 9----->for the investor to break even is such that
ws + V − D? > E,

(1)

the entrepreneur prefers to repay his debt for any value of C < 2C(e? ). For this reason,
the fear of having to ask for more money plays the role of a discipline device which
induces the first-best level of eﬀort. Assuming, that the entrepreneur always repay
his debt, the break-even condition writes simply: D? = 2C(e? ). In turn, equation 1
rewrites :

ws − wf > 4C(e? ) − V

(2)

Remark that for any ² ≥ 0, all contracts of the form I0 = C(e? ) + ², D = D? + ²

have the same properties. In term of payoﬀs and of incentives, only the diﬀerence
I0 − D matters. In what follows, when several contracts are optimal, we pick the one
than minimizes I0 and D, a convention that makes comparisons possible5 .

In brief, when the stigma of failure is high enough, the first-best is implemented.
The investor does not invest in technological expertise and the fear of failure is sufficient for the entrepreneur to commit to repay his debt and perform optimal eﬀort.
This type of lending has the essential characteristics of bank finance.
Proposition 1 There exists a threshold value ∆? = 4C(e? ) − V such that for ws −
wf > ∆? :

• Investor does not have technological expertise: H = 0.
• The optimal contract consists of an initial injection of cash I0 = 2C(e? ).
• There is no renegotiation.
5

• First best eﬀort, e? , is implemented.

Such a contract would be the optimal contract for an arbitrary small opportunity cost of injecting
money at t = 0 rather than t = 2.

10

C

Consider now what happens when the stigma of failure becomes small, i.e. ws −wf

just below ∆? . Implementing the first-best becomes impossible because the condition
that the entrepreneur does not find it attractive to renegotiate for C < 2C(e? ) is now
incompatible with the break-even condition. There are two tools that can be used ex
ante to solve the commitment problem of the entrepreneur. First, the investor can
decrease I0 , which has only a second-order impact on the surplus (through a firstorder decrease in eﬀort) but relaxes the budget constraint to the first-order. He can
also acquire technological expertise ex ante. Since V 0 (0) = +∞, both tools are used
at the optimum contract. We let the formal proof for the appendix and try to go
further with an intuitive derivation of the optimal contract. Decreasing I0 decreases
incentives to perform eﬀort and leads to a level of eﬀort e < e? , since the excess
of cash that the entrepreneur can try to keep is smaller. The positive relationship
between eﬀort and I0 (which constitutes the incentive compatibility constraint) is:6
s
C(e)2
I0 = 2 − 0 e.
C (e)
Therefore, a larger I0 also means a larger average cost, C(e) > C(e? ). Since I0 <
2C(e? ), this implies that with a positive probability (1 − I0 /2C(e)), the entrepreneur
does not have suﬃcient cash from the first injection to pursue the project and has to
6

Remark that e? is solution of this equation for I0 = 2C(e? ).

11

<-----Page 11----->negotiate for a second cash-injection. When this occurs, the sharing rule is determined
by the terms of bargaining. Now, when the realization of C is smaller than I0 , as I
show in appendix, at the optimal contract, the entrepreneur repays his debt7 .
Proposition 2 For ws − wf < ∆? , optimal contracting results in:
• A positive level of technological expertise H,
• A first injection I0 < C(e? ). Eﬀort is second-best, e?? < e? .
• There is a positive probability that a second injection I1 occurs.
• The cost of capital for a given project is higher than when ws − wf < ∆? ,
reflecting undereﬀort and the cost of expertise.

The total expected level of cash needed to finance

The loss in eﬃciency due to the hold-up friction is L = γH + (1 − p)(C(e?? ) − C(e? )).
7

The repayment D is equal to what would occur in case of renegotiation (but the investor does
not have to make a complementary cash injection).

12

<-----Page 12----->Proposition 3 In the second-best region (∆ < ∆? ), as the stigma of failure ∆ =
ws − wf decreases:
• The level of technological expertise of investor increases.
• Eﬀort decreases : The lower the stigma of failure, the more stringent the incentive constraint is.

• The probability that a second-stage investment occurs increases as the level of
eﬀort decreases. This probability is: 1 − (−e?? /C 0 (e?? ))1/2 .

• The initial cash injection decreases, the average second cash-injection increases,
the total amount of cash needed increases.

• The loss in eﬃciency with regard to the first best is decreasing with ∆ and
increasing with the cost of technological expertise H.

This benchmark model captures the main intuition of the paper:
As long as the stigma of failure (ws − wf ) is “high enough” simple debt contracts

are the optimal mode of financing. The investor does not need to acquire technological
expertise: the fear to be forced to raise new funding operates as a discipline device
and forces entrepreneurs to choose the first-best eﬀort. In turn, the investor has no
power to exercise a threat on the entrepreneur as long as he repays his debt. This
kind of financing has the characteristics of bank debt.
Conversely, when the stigma of failure is low, the entrepreneur cannot commit
not to trigger renegotiation. This leads to a loss in eﬃciency that is partly solved by
having the investor acquire technological expertise. This expertise, by alleviating the
hold-up threat of the entrepreneur, rebalances the terms of bargaining. This improvement in the eﬃciency of the terms of bargaining represents the “value-enhancement”
of venture-capital as a style of financing in our model. It however has costs, simply
those of high-skilled technological expertise. The model shows that an endogenous
staging of capital injection in two rounds occurs.

13

<-----Page 13----->Proposition 4 A testable prediction of the model is the following:
Ceteris paribus, the higher the stigma of failure, the higher the ratio of second-stage
infusion over first-stage infusion.

3

Value Enhancing Investors

In our model, the value enhancement of investor’s expertise lies exclusively in the
resolution of a hold-up problem. As a consequence, whenever bank debt is possible,
it is also first-best eﬃcient. This feature is not essential to the model. For example,
when the technological knowledge of the investor adds value to the project (e.g., if
the payoﬀ is an increasing function of H, V (H)) it might be first-best to have a
positive level of H and a large stigma of failure would lead to a level of technological
monitoring lower than H. In this case, the relationship between eﬃciency and stigma
might be non-monotonic. Venture capitalists are known to add value to the ventures
they finance, e.g. by helping to hire appropriate managements, or using their network
to help the entrepreneur to obtaining contracts.

4

The Stigma of Failure

The framework we have developed allows us to clarify the link between the stigma
of failure and the nature of financial institutions and contracts. The determinants of
the stigma can be both exogenous (institutions) or endogenous (informational).

4.1

Exogenous Stigma

Assume that bankruptcy rules or liquidation rules are the determinants of the stigma:
ws = w, wf = w − ∆. We assume that ∆ is pure waste for society (think to ∆ as the

time it takes for the entrepreneur to be discharged and able to go on with his career).
We can use our model to describe how ∆ aﬀects financial contracts and what level
of ∆ is eﬃcient. There is a trade-oﬀ between the disciplining eﬀect of ∆ and its cost

14

<-----Page 14----->for society. A higher ∆ alleviates the commitment problem of the entrepreneur but
diminishes the expected surplus by p∆.
Proposition 5

• There exists a threshold p? < 1 such that for p < p? , the optimal

bankruptcy cost ∆ is positive and decreases with p.

• Investor’s expertise and the probability of second-stage financing decrease weakly
with ∆ (strictly decrease for p < p? ).

The first point shows that bankruptcy rules are an eﬀective way to give bargainingpower to the investor and that the riskier the sector, the more distortionnary it is.
The second point shows that softer bankruptcy rules ask for an investor with higher
technological monitoring. Even though bankruptcy rules vary across countries, they
are not the only component of the stigma of failure. As it is shown in the last section,
a crucial component of the stigma of failure is the endogenous competent resulting
from the market’s inference about the ability of a failed entrepreneur.

4.2

Endogenous Stigma

We now extend our model so as to endogenize the stigma of failure, ws − wf in a
simple career-concern set-up.8

Assume that there are two types of entrepreneurs: Good types (G) —in proportion
θ— and bad types (B). Initially, the types are unknown to everyone, including the
entrepreneurs. The type of an entrepreneur matters for two distinct reasons: it
aﬀects the probability of being competent on the entrepreneurial project and the
entrepreneur’s productivity on the labor-market. High (low) types have a probability
pG (pB = 1) to be incompetent to finish their project and therefore, the ex ante
probability for an entrepreneur to fail on a project is p = θpG + (1 − θ). The wage
w will reflect inference conditional on the history of the entrepreneur (competent or

not). Bad types have a productivity normalized to zero on the labor market, while
high types have productivity y.
8

This formalization is related to Landier (2001).

15

<-----Page 15----->Inference on productivity:
Since there is a proportion θ of good types in the population, the probability that
a “fired” entrepreneur is of high type is:
πf =

θpG
.
θpG + (1 − θ)

Since bad entrepreneurs never succeed, the probability that a “successful” entrepreneur is of the good type is one: πs = 1.
The wage on the labor-market is competitive and therefore equal to the expected of
the entrepreneur conditional on the available information. The wage is therefore ws =
π s y if the entrepreneur has been replaced and wf = (1 − π f )y if he has successfully
completed his project.

The stigma of failure is:
Proposition 6 The “stigma of failure” is a decreasing function of pG and therefore
of p:
ws − wf =

1−θ
1−θ
=
.
θpG + (1 − θ)
p

We use this career concern structure in two contexts: first we want to study how
sectorial characteristics impact the “style of financing”. Second, we show how complementarities between the strategies chosen by entrepreneurs might lead to multiple
equilibria and therefore to diﬀerences in lending styles in a given sector of similar
economies.

5

Start-up Finance and Sector Characteristics

In this section, we do comparative statics with regard to pG the probability that
a good entrepreneur fails. When pG goes through [0, 1], the ex ante risk of failure
p = θpG + (1 − θ) goes through [1 − θ, 1]. p can be seen as an index of sectors, a

higher p meaning a riskier sector. The payoﬀ in case of success in sector p is V (p) and

the cost function is C(p, e). As before, there are good and bad entrepreneurs. Bad
16

<-----Page 16----->entrepreneurs always fail and good entrepreneurs fail with probability pG (p) = 1− 1−p
,
θ
which is increasing with sector-risk p. We assume that entrepreneurs are randomly
aﬀected across sectors, justifying the fact that θ is constant across sectors.
Assumption 1 Riskier sectors have higher payoﬀs in case of success:
If p < p0 , Vp < Vp0 and Vp (H) < Vp0 (H) for all H > 0.
Failing in a low-risk sector is more informative than failing in a high-risk sector: to
fail in a low-risk sector, “you really have to be bad”. As a consequence, the “stigma
of failure” decreases with the sector index p :

Lemma 1
• A failed entrepreneur is more likely to be of high type in a riskier sector.
• The stigma of failure, ∆(p) = wsp − wfp = ( 1−θ
)y, decreases with the index p.
p
Now, we want to compare the ways of financing (contracts and institutions) in
these sectors. To do so, we need a normalization assumption. Specifically, we make
the following homogeneity assumption:
Assumption 2

• (1 − p)C(p, e) and (1 − p)V (p) are independent on p and the

private cost for project p is

e2
.
2(1−p)

• ∆? (1 − θ) = 4C(1 − θ, e? ) − V (1 − θ) is positive.
Under these assumptions, the level of first-best eﬀort does not depend on p and
∆? (p) =

∆? (0)
1−p

increases with p.

Therefore, ∆(p) − ∆? (p) decreases with p, implying that the incentive constraint

becomes more stringent. As a consequence, assuming that sectors are financed with
the optimal institution , the following is true when we move towards more risky sectors
(higher p) :
17

<-----Page 17----->Proposition 7 When p increases:
• The level of technological expertise Hp? is higher and the level of eﬀort diminishes
(weakly).

• The cost of capital increases, due to the higher level of expertise required from
the investor.

• The level of the first cash injection decreases and the probability of a second

cash injection to occur increases. The expected level of this second cash injection
increases as well, while the first cash injection decreases.

Moreover, if we assume that y > ∆? (1 − θ), the less risky project (p = 0) can be

financed by “bank debt” (i.e. with H = 0) while the most risky is in the second-best
region, where renegotiation occurs with positive probability, we have:
Proposition 8 There exists a cut-oﬀ sector p0 such that:
• If p < p0 , sector p is financed by an investor without expertise (Hp? = 0) and a

simple debt contract. In other words, traditional bank lending prevail in these
sectors.

• If p > p0 , sector p is financed by an investor with expertise Hp? > 0, increasing in
p. This type of financing has the characteristics of venture capital (e.g. staging
in two rounds).

Growth Strategies and Multiple Equilibria.

So far our model explains why diﬀerent sorts of institutions and financial contracts
might emerge to finance entrepreneurship in diﬀerent sectors. It does not however
18

<-----Page 18----->explain why venture capital would succeed in certain economies but fail to become an
important source of start-up funding in otherwise similar economies.9 The explanation we propose is based on multiple equilibria: Assume that entrepreneurs within a
given sector can choose diﬀerent development strategies. They can choose aggressive
business plans leading to “big hits” but likely to fail or they can choose more secure
growth strategies, leading to smaller but more certain payoﬀs. Two equilibria can
exist.
• In a “high-risk” equilibrium, entrepreneurs choose “high-risk” strategies for
their project (meaning the probability for the entrepreneur to be incompetent

is high). Therefore the stigma of failure is low which ensures that low-risk
strategies do not look attractive.
• Conversely, in a “low-risk” equilibrium, the fact that all entrepreneurs choose

low-risk strategies makes the stigma of failure high. Therefore, “high-risk”
strategies are unattractive.

We now formalize this idea. The set-up is as in section one, except for the fact that
the entrepreneur now chooses irreversibly at time zero among two possible strategies
(or business plans) for the project: a risky one (p2 , V2 ) and a low-risk one (p1 , V1 ).
This choice is observable by the investor but cannot be credibly signaled to the labor
market once the entrepreneur has failed.
There are two potential pure strategy equilibria in our model: one where entrepreneurs all choose the low-risk strategy and one where they all choose the high-risk
strategy.
We note ∆?1 = 4C1 (e?1 ) − V1 , ∆?2 = 4C2 (e?2 ) − V2 . The stigma of failure ∆ is

determined in each potential equilibrium by ∆i =

1−θ
,
pi

therefore ∆1 > ∆2 : the

stigma of failure is higher in a low-risk than in a high-risk equilibrium..
For both types of projects, we note Bi = (1 −pi )(Vi −Ci (e?i ) − e?2
i /2), the expected

first-best value generated by project i.
9

More exactly, the only explanation it gives is that when the cost of technological expertise, γ,
is too high, the commitment problem cannot be resolved.

19

<-----Page 19----->We note Li (∆) = (1 − pi )(Ci (ei (∆)) − Ci (e?i ) + (ei (∆)2 − e?2
i )/2) + γHi (∆) the

eﬃciency loss in equilibrium i. Li is a decreasing function of ∆.

The condition for project i to be preferred to project j in equilibrium (i) is that:

−pi ∆i + (Bi − Li (∆i )) > −pj ∆i + (Bj − Lj (∆i ))
Proposition 9
• The low-risk equilibrium exists if
∆1 >

B2 − B1 L1 (∆1 ) − L2 (∆1 )
+
.
p2 − p1
p2 − p1

• The high-risk equilibrium (“high-risk”) exists if
∆2 <

B2 − B1 L1 (∆2 ) − L2 (∆2 )
+
.
p2 − p1
p2 − p1

• Therefore, the condition for the two equilibria to coexist is that:
∆2 +

L2 (∆2 ) − L1 (∆2 )
B2 − B1
L2 (∆1 ) − L1 (∆1 )
<
< ∆1 +
p2 − p1
p2 − p1
p2 − p1

To perform welfare analysis, since the investor makes zero profit, we have to
compare the ex ante value of a project in each equilibrium, i.e.
Wi = Bi − Li (∆i )
The last expression rewrites:
∆2 +

L1 (∆1 ) − L1 (∆2 )
W2 − W1
L2 (∆1 ) − L2 (∆2 )
<
< ∆1 +
p2 − p1
p2 − p1
p2 − p1

Using this criterion, we can discuss the coexistence and the relative eﬃciency of
the equilibria:
Proposition 10

• The high-risk and low-risk equilibria can coexist.

• Depending on parameters, each equilibrium can be more eﬃcient than the other.
20

<-----Page 20----->• The high-risk equilibrium is the most eﬃcient if the diﬀerence in the value of
the projects exceeds the higher costs of financing, i.e.,

B2 − B1 > L2 (∆2 ) − L1 (∆1 ),
To summarize, we compare the two regimes of entrepreneurship in the case where
the diﬀerence in stigmas in the two equilibria is large enough such that ∆1 < ∆?1 and
∆2 > ∆?2 (a condition under which the coexistence result still holds).
Proposition 11 Compared to the low-risk equilibrium, the high-risk equilibrium is
characterized by:
• investors with more technological expertise.
• a higher probability of second-stage financing, with this probability being zero in
the low-risk equilibrium.

• a higher probability for the entrepreneur to fail.
• a lower stigma of failure (ws − wf ).
• a higher cost of capital.
Proposition 12
• An increase in V2 increases the eﬃciency and the likelihood of the high-risk
equilibrium.

• An increase in the cost of technological expertise reduces the eﬃciency and the
likelihood of the high-risk equilibrium.

The first point illustrates that when there are large returns to risky strategies, the
high-risk equilibrium tends to be both more likely and more eﬃcient. This is likely
to be the case in high-tech sectors. The picture that emerges from this proposition is
broadly the one of Europe vs. the US:
21

<-----Page 21----->• In Europe, young firms tend to have strategies that are not very aggressive.

This leads to few “firings” of entrepreneurs and a high-stigma of failure (you

have to be a bad manager to fail a conservative strategy), which in turn makes
aggressive strategies too risky to be attractive. Financing does not require
financial expertise of the investor: the stigma of failure plays the role of a
discipline device, making simple debt contracts possible.
• On the contrary, in the US entrepreneurs choose risky, more aggressive strate-

gies, that make them more likely to be unsuccessful. For this reason, the stigma
of failure is low (having failed does not reveal much about your ability). This
in turn creates a hold-up problem, leading to:
— Acquisition of expertise from the investor to rebalance the terms of bargaining.
— Staging of the investment in two rounds.
— A higher cost of project’s financing, reflecting the cost of investor’s skills
and the moral hazard problem (undereﬀort).

A quotation of Eric Benhamou, a french entrepreneur who emigrated to Silicon
Valley and is currently the CEO of 3Com summarizes this link between strategy
choice and the stigma of failure:
“As a student at Stanford, I realized how naive I had been to believe I could
start a business in France.[...]in France, you keep all your life the stigma
of a failure. Here [in Silicon Valley] it is the mark of your entrepreneurial
spirit. In France, it is common practice to give up on growth in order to
limit risk. Here, when you start a venture, your goal is to become number
one of your sector”.

New Ventures: Europe vs. the US.

7.1

Financing

Venture Capital has played a prominent role in the technological leadership of the
US10 . More than 70% of firms in the personal computer industries have been venturecapital backed. Giant companies such as Cisco, Cray, Genentech, Lotus, Apple and
Microsoft got started with venture capital.
In 1999, the US venture capital industry raises more than three times more capital
than the rest of the world taken together. The development of Venture Capital funds
in Europe has grown recently. However, it is diﬃcult to draw a line between private
equity and venture capital. If we aggregate the two, we find that about $99.4 billion
of private equity and VC was invested in North America ($97.1 raised) in 1999, which
amounts to 1.01% of GDP, whereas only $26.8 billion was invested in Europe ($27.1
bil. raised), i.e. 0.3% of the European GDP. While European countries have an
increasing amount of venture capital under management, most of it is dedicated to
buyouts of mature companies rather than seed or start-up financing. About 13%
of financing went to seed and start-up in Europe against more than 30% in the US.
Restricting oneself to the high tech industry makes this opposition even more striking:
26% in Europe against 80% in the US.
Characteristics of venture-capital contracts in the US include staging of investment
and a high level of control rights. The replacement of the founder of the company by
a manager who is more able to accomplish the project occurs with high probability.
Moreover, venture capitalists spend a large amount of time learning about the technological aspects of the project of the firm both pre and post first-state financing. In
our model, this intensity of technological monitoring —requiring a high level of expertise on the investor’s side— and the staging of cash infusions are endogenous features
of venture-capital as a lending technology.
European venture capitalists are traditionally less “hands on” and less strategi10
Venture capital rivals in-house R&D as a major source of funding for innovation: as reported by
M.Mandel, based on a report of the NVCA, “in the first quarter of 2000, Venture Capital equaled
one-third of all money spent on R&D compared to 3% in the 80s”.

23

<-----Page 23----->cally involved than their American counterparts. In the context of our model, this
means that they perform less technological monitoring. Sapienza, Manigart and Vermeir (1996) provide empirical evidence that French venture capitalists spend much
less eﬀort than their American counterparts in monitoring the firms they finance.
They describe French venture capitalists as closer to bank managers than value-added
investors.
Historically, early-stage venture-capital funds in Europe have produced relatively
low rates of return (as compared to buyout funds, for example). Investment appears
to be less high-tech in Europe. For example, in Europe, less than 20% of all venture
capital investment was in high tech in 1998 compared with more than 60% for the
US. Compared to the US, European venture capital devotes a much larger percentage
of venture financing goes to manufacturing rather than High-tech.

7.2

The Stigma of Failure: Some Empirical Evidence

To quantify the “stigma of failure”, I use wage information in labor market data.
Two studies based on US data, Evans and Leighton (1989) and Hamilton (2000),
establish that American entrepreneurs returning to employment earn slightly higher
wages than other workers with similar characteristics.11
To my knowledge, no such study exists for France. I run my own regressions, using Enquête-Emploi, an annual survey of 1/300 of the French population. I find that
French entrepreneurs returning to paid employment earn significantly lower wages
than other workers. To control for transitions between self-employment and employment, I construct a sequence of two-year panel data. Given year t and t + 1, I know
the employment status of each individual for both years: employed, self-employed,
unemployed or out of the labor force. I also know the wage wt of employees, but not
11
Evans and Leighton (1989), relies on the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (19661981) and finds that “workers who fail at self-employment return to wage work at roughly the same
wages they would have received had they not tried self-employment”. Each additional year of selfemployment experience increases the mean wages of males aged 29-39 by 4.5%, as compared with an
increase of 3.1% for an extra year of wage experience. Hamilton (2000) uses the Survey of Income and
Program Participation (1984) and finds that “entrepreneurs returning to paid employment actually
earn a higher wage than employees with the same observed characteristics”.

24

<-----Page 24----->the income of the self-employed. Given this restriction, I run the following regression12
in order to “estimate” the stigma of failure is:
0
β + αSEt + ²,
ln(wt+1 ) = Xt+1

where Xt+1 is the vector of observable characteristics of employed individuals in year
t + 1, and SEt , a dummy variable equal to 1 if the individual is self-employed in
year t. The coeﬃcient α estimates the percentage wage premium for individuals who
made the transition from self-employment in year t to employment in year t + 1. I
run this regression from 1990 to 2000. I find that in contrast to what prevails in the
US, self-employed who become employees earn significantly less than other employees.
The wage discount is -13% on average over the period.
This wage discount can reflect that leaving self-employment is a bad signal to
the labor-market. Alternatively, however, it could reflect a selection eﬀect, i.e., selfemployed are of a relatively low type with regard to the rest of the population, in a
way that the market but not the econometrician observes. To control for this eﬀect,
I run the following regression on all paid employees of period t:
ln(wt ) = Xt0 β + δSEt+1 + ²,
where SEt+1 is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the individual has become self-employed
at time t + 1. The coeﬃcient δ estimates whether workers who make the transition
from paid employment to self-employment have relatively low wages vis-a-vis the rest
of the population13 . It turns out that it is not the case: δ is only -0.017 on average
over the period and insignificant for most years. This confirm that the discount α is
not due to selection and thus can be interpreted as a proxy for the stigma of failure.
This estimation allows us to conclude that the wage discount α captures mostly the
“stigma of failure”.
In summary, the picture that emerges from these empirical results confirms that
the French and US labor markets react diﬀerently to the termination of entrepreneurial activity. In contrast with the US labor market, the French labor market penalizes
heavily those who quit self-employment for employment.

Route 128 vs. Silicon Valley

Saxenian (1994) describes how Silicon Valley and Route 128 —two regions that had
similar innovative advantages in the early 1980’s— evolved diﬀerently. Route 128 lost
its competitive edge, generating three times less jobs in the high tech industry between
1975 and 1990 than Silicon Valley. Saxenian shows how this divergence is related to
diﬀerent social norms concerning job mobility and failure. While Route 128 has a
conservative culture, valuing safer projects and careers, Silicon Valley has created an
environment that encourages risk and accepts failure. “There is little embarrassment
or shame associated with business failure. In fact, the list of individuals who failed,
even repeatedly, only to succeed later was well-known in the region.” The diﬀerent
performance of the two regions is reflected in the levels of venture capital investment.
For example, in 1981, 38% of the US venture capital went to California, but only
12% to Massachusetts based companies. Interestingly, the nature of venture-capital
itself has been diﬀerent in the two regions. Saxenian gives the following quote from
a top executive of DEC who became a consultant in Silicon Valley: “There is no
real venture capital in Massachussets. The venture capital community is a bunch of
very conservative bankers. They are radically diﬀerent from the venture capitalists
in Silicon Valley.” This picture matches the multiple equilibria characteristic of the
model.

Conclusion

This paper presents a model of entrepreneurial finance, where the outside option
of entrepreneurs in case of failure determines the staging of investment in diﬀerent
rounds and the choice of a monitoring technology. I show how, in turn, the outside
option depends on the industry parameters, on the legal environment and on the
coordination of agents. I describe how these diﬀerent styles of financing relate to
bank debt vs. venture capital. If agents can choose between aggressive or safe growth
strategies, I show that two equilibria can arise with diﬀerent eﬃciency consequences.
In a low-risk equilibrium, entrepreneurs choose safe projects, failure is highly stig-

26

<-----Page 26----->matized and, therefore, the optimal style of financing is bank debt. In a high-risk
equilibrium, entrepreneurs choose riskier projects. In this equilibrium, failure is not
stigmatized and the optimal form of financing requires intense technological monitoring and investment staging, features which are characteristic of venture capital. The
theory explains why similar economies might be in diﬀerent entrepreneurial regimes,
characterized by diﬀerent growth strategies and diﬀerent financial institutions.

Take H as given.

Remark that only I0 − D is relevant for incentives. When several contracts are

optimal, we select the one that minimizes I0 . This contract would be dominant for
an arbitrarily small opportunity cost of injecting money at the beginning.
Let C ? be such that V + I0 − D + ws − C ? = E.

• First assume that the optimization problem leads to a level of eﬀort e?? such
that C ? > C(e?? ). That means that the entrepreneur will never find it attractive

to trigger renegotiation, and therefore, his maximization problem rewrites:
max(V + I0 − D + ws ) − C(e) − e2 /2
e

which is the first-best program. Therefore, e?? = e? . The contract that minimizes
the level of D is an initial injection I0 = 2C(e? ) and a level of debt D? determined
by the break-even condition of the investor:
(1 − p)D? = 2(1 − p)C(e? ) + γH
It follows that, as long as D? = 2C(e? ) +

i.e.

then an initial injection I0 = 2C(e? ) leads to the implementation of the first best
eﬀort e? .
32

<-----Page 32----->Remark that in this region, higher bargaining power of the investor does not lead
to ineﬃcient outcomes, since as long as he repays his debt, the investor cannot hodup the entrepreneur. In this region, the optimal level of H is zero, which is also the
first-best level. Therefore, the threshold is:
∆? = 4C(e? ) − V.
• Consider (ws − wf ) just below ∆? ? The level of eﬀort e?? is now such that
C ? < C(e?? ), so that the optimization problem rewrites:

e = C ?2
C 0 (e?? )

The function f increases with e?? (from the assumption that 1/C(e) is concave).
Therefore, e?? decreases with C ? .
Remark that for C ? = C(e? ), the solution is e?? = e? since e? = −C 0 (e? ). Since we

look for the contract that minimizes I0 , at the margin, the entrepreneur is just able
to cover his costs, namely I0 = C ? .
The second-best choice of eﬀort and technological expertise is determined by the
maximization of the ex-ante surplus,

Since by assumption, even for e = 0, continuation is eﬃcient, and since [ ∂e
(e2 /2)](e =
