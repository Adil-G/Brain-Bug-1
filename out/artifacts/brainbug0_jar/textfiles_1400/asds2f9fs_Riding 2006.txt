<-----Page 1----->Objectives of this work (1)

1.

To examine the extent to which data collected via the
Survey on Financing of SMEs contributes to the goal of
measuring actual and potential informal investment in
Canada.
Use data collected from the Survey on Financing of
SMEs to estimate the flow of informal investment from
respondents to the survey.
Use data collected from the Survey on Financing of
SMEs to estimate the potential stock of capital available
for informal investment from respondents to the survey.
Evaluate how these data improve our understanding of
the flow and stock of financing beyond the estimates
available in the literature.

<-----Page 2----->Objectives of this work (2)

2.

To identify what limitations might exist in the interpretation
of the data from the Survey on Financing of SMEs.

3.

To formulate additional methods that might be employed
to estimate the extent of informal investment in Canada.

4.

To assess the data from the Survey on Financing of SMEs
to determine the level of investment that can be solely
attributable to “angel” investors, as opposed to the broader
category, “informal investors”, which includes friends and
family.

5.

To compare findings with other research on informal
investment and business angels.

<-----Page 3----->Analysis of Data
from Survey

<-----Page 4----->Keep in mind …

Respondents to survey are business owners
Not all angels are business owners
Respondents represent a subset of angels
Â Equinox, 2001, “Practices & Patterns of Informal
Investors”, reported that 91% of angels were business
owners:
P (Business Owner/Angel) = 0.91
Â

Survey results represent only a (so far, unknown) portion
of informal investor population

Question H.7:
“Excluding publicly-traded shares, mutual funds or stocks,
did the majority owners of the business make any
investments in any other businesses at any point since
1990?”
10.8 percent of SME owners in the sampling frame
reported making investments since 1990
P (Informal Investor / Business Owner) = .108

6

Question H.8:
“Approximately how many other businesses did the
majority owners make new investments in [for each of the
time periods: 2001, 2000, and 1990-1999]?”
Collectively:
101,574 investments during 2001
Â 96,568 investments during 2000
Â More than 200,00 investments 1990-1999.

Note: conforms closely with average size of
investments from most studies of angel investors

2001:

Question H.14
“During 2001, how much did the majority owners have
available to invest in other business ventures?”
Median amount available was in the $25,000 to $50,000
range and the average amount available was $92,550.
Â

10.8 percent of the 1,285,620 business owners in the
sampling frame had made investments and average
amount available was $92,550

Â

Estimated stock of capital held by respondents to the
survey:
$12.85 billion

13

<-----Page 13----->Caveats

Estimates reflect:
Only informal investors who are business owners
Â

Omits assessments for informal investors who are not
business owners

Â

Therefore, estimates provided here understate actual flow
and stock

Investments by broadly defined informal investors
Â

Include “love money”

Â

Include investments in own (new?) firms

Based on “tombstone data”
Table 26 of published Data Tables:
Â

Informal investors are associated more with:
• Younger firms;
• Larger firms (as shown by Figure 2);
» Therefore with growth-oriented firms

• Firms that are majority men owned;
• Older owners;
• Firms with relatively high ratios of R&D and technology
investments to sales;
• Exporter firms (however, this may also be a
manifestation of the related finding, that the likelihood of
investing in another firms varies according to firm size.

<-----Page 22----->Moving Beyond the Sampling Frame

Recall:
P (Business Owner/Angel) = 0.91
Equinox, 2001
P (Informal Investor / Business Owner) = 0.108
Question H.7
P (Angel / Informal Investor) ≥ 0.139
Questions H.9, H.12
Therefore, P (Angel / Business Owner) ≥ 0.108 X 0.139
≥ 0.015
From probability theory, P(A/B)/P(B/A) = P(A)/P(B)
Hence, P (Angel) =(0.015) X P (Business Owner) / 0.91
Or, P (Angel) ≥ 0.0165 X P (Business Owner)
23

<-----Page 23----->Moving Beyond the Sampling Frame

Expressed differently, the number of angels in the general
population is, based on these data, equal to 1.65 percent of
the number of business owners in the population.
Given:
a sampling frame of 1,285,620 businesses,
Average annual investment by angels of $166,000
Estimated minimum flow of angel capital during 2001 was
$3.5 billion

<-----Page 24----->Other Findings

<-----Page 25----->Rates of Return

Farrell (2000, pp. 30-31):
there is simply no data about the rates of return informal
investors have realized in Canada – or elsewhere.
Survey includes questions to business owner respondents
that potentially add to our knowledge about realized rates
of return.

26

<-----Page 26----->Rates of Return

Question H.10:
“[had] the majority owners sold any of these shares in
these other businesses obtained since 1990?”
26.7 percent of respondent owners reported having sold
shares of the businesses
For the subset who responded that they had sold shares,
Question H.11 asked:
“What was the average rate of return on these shares that
were sold?”

This is important because, as Lerner (1998) argues, it may
be counterproductive to the economy “to encourage
amateur individual investors.”
Start-ups are inherently risky
Nothing about family members makes them astute
investors, mentors, or managers
Raises a real question about whether policy should be
directed towards making non-angels into angels!

<-----Page 29----->Summary

<-----Page 30----->Reprise: Objectives of the Work

1.

Use data collected from the Survey on Financing of
SMEs to estimate the flow and stock of informal
investment from respondents to the survey.
Have done so
Â
Flow of informal investment > $11.4 billion
Â

Stock of informal investment > $12.8 billion

Â

Evaluate how these data improve our understanding
•
•
•

Best estimates available anywhere in the world
Are minima, because survey captures only a portion of
the population of informal investors
Caveat: very broad definition of informal investment

31

<-----Page 31----->Reprise: Objectives of the Work

2.

To identify what limitations might exist in the interpretation
of the data from the Survey on Financing of SMEs.
a)
Need greater precision in questions to allow for multiple
investments
b)
Need larger sample size because of
Â
Â

3.

Low overall incidence on informal investors and angels in
the general population
Need for greater precision in breakdowns of small N

To formulate additional methods that might be employed to
estimate the extent of informal investment in Canada.
a)
Link results to findings from other surveys and external data
Â
Â

For example, used probability theory to combine results of
Survey with previous research findings
Potential role for findings from Survey of Financial Security
32

<-----Page 32----->Reprise: Objectives of the Work

To assess the data from the Survey on Financing of SMEs to
determine the level of investment that can be solely attributable to
“angel” investors, as opposed to the broader category, “informal
investors”, which includes friends and family.

4.

a)

b)
c)

Have provided 2 X 2 initial breakdowns of informal investment that
represent minima
Estimated annual flow of angel investment > $3.5 billion
Need additional precision with respect to questions that currently
confound situations with multiple investments

To compare findings with other research on informal investment and
business angels.

5.

Major contributions with respect to

Estimating flow and stock of investment
Categorization of informal investors across angels, love money,
entrepreneurs (still need to fine-tune questions)
Estimating returns on informal investment across categories of
investor (still need to fine-tune questions, increase size of sample)
