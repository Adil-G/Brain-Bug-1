What are the origins of the ability to continuously explore novel domains of activity
while at the same time exploiting the current knowledge base with increasing efﬁcacy?
The conﬂicting objectives of exploration and exploitation compete for scarce resources,
among which managerial attention is possibly the most critical. This paper integrates
recent ﬁndings on the neuromodulation of attention to provide a foundational step in
understanding how the mind of the manager handles the exploration⫺exploitation
dilemma. Also, this paper proposes several possible ways to combine research in
neuroscience, psychology, and management to advance our knowledge of the microfoundations of managerial decision-making.

zations and their members in trying to ﬁnd a
balance among competing activities in the context of scarce resources—the need to be efﬁcient to get the most from a current situation,
while at the same time exploring possibilities
for future improvements. As March (1991) puts
it:
Adaptive systems that engage in exploration
to the exclusion of exploitation are likely to ﬁnd
that they suffer the costs of experimentation
without gaining many of its beneﬁts. They exhibit too many undeveloped new ideas and too
little distinctive competence. Conversely, systems that engage in exploitation to the exclusion
of exploration are likely to ﬁnd themselves
trapped in suboptimal stable equilibria. As a result, maintaining an appropriate balance between
exploration and exploitation is a primary factor in
system survival and prosperity (March, 1991).
Levinthal and March (1993) similarly argue
that “an organization that engages exclusively
in exploration will ordinarily suffer from the
fact that it never gains the returns of its knowledge” and that “an organization that engages
exclusively in exploitation will ordinarily suffer
from obsolescence” (p. 105). A narrow search
can lead to increasingly rigid cognitive maps
and highly specialized competencies that may
become core rigidities (Leonard-Barton, 1995).
The so called “ambidexterity hypothesis”
(Tushman & O’Reilly, 1996) states that the
higher the organizational ability to balance ex-

Adaptive ﬁrm behavior in a diverse and rapidly changing environment requires a trade-off
between exploiting known sources of reward
and exploring the environment for more valuable or stable opportunities. This trade-off is
known as the exploration⫺exploitation dilemma (March, 1991) and is present at different
levels of analysis and different time scales of
decision-making. There is no general optimal
policy for how to manage the trade-off between
exploration and exploitation in nonstationary
environments (Cohen, McClure, & Yu, 2007).
From a managerial point of view, the
exploration⫺exploitation dilemma, which is
key to many of the challenges faced by organizations, refers to the difﬁculty faced by organi-

ploration and exploitation, the higher the organizational performance.
Since March’s (1991) seminal article, the
management literature has used the terms “exploration” and “exploitation” in studies of organizational adaptation, organizational learning,
competitive advantage, technological innovation, organization design, and organizational
survival. However, “an examination of the literature indicates that the answers contained
there to the central questions on this subject
remain incomplete, at times contradictory, and
at best ambiguous” (Gupta, Smith, & Shalley,
2006). The review in Section 2 shows that while
the exploration⫺exploitation literature is extensive and growing, there are gaps that we believe
derive from a lack of understanding of the dilemma at the micro level, that is, the individual
decision-makers’ point of view. There is an
intriguing opportunity to better understand this
point of view. The recent development of
knowledge in the cognitive neurosciences
opens, in fact, exciting possibilities to build
integrative approaches to understand organizational dilemmas from a micro perspective. That
is the overarching objective in this paper: to
explore an organizational conundrum from an
individual level of analysis, showing how interpersonal variation in the decision-maker’s neurological disposition affects the decisional outcomes and, potentially, the performance of a
given task connected to that decision.
To do so, the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 brieﬂy presents the main gaps in the
organizational literature on exploration– exploitation, focusing on the one that this paper aims to
contribute to; Section 3 addresses the microfoundations—that is, the individual origins— of
this dilemma, whereas Section 4 contributes by
bridging with neuroscience and discussing certain ﬁndings in that domain that may help to
clarify the roots of the managerial dilemma and
suggest ways to cope with it. We then provide
an illustration of how the theory we developed
might explain the behavior and the outcomes
connected to one of the most famous innovators
of modern times: Thomas Alva Edison. Section 6 then presents the main challenges involved in the development of an empirical
agenda to validate these ideas, offering a full set
of suggestions on how to tackle them, and Section 7 concludes with several suggestions for

the development of this line of work in future
research.
Gaps in the Management Literature on the
Exploration–Exploitation Dilemma
A review of the literature on the
exploration⫺exploitation managerial dilemma
uncovers several limitations and gaps, which we
brieﬂy cover with the aim to focus on and
potentially contribute toward resolving one particular gap: variation among individuals in the
tendency to respond in an exploitative or explorative way to a given stimulus, and on the
ability to shift their responses according to
changes in the environmental conditions, have
not been explored.
A central gap is that most of the extant research focuses on the structural antecedents to
and the effects of involvement in exploration
and exploitation on ﬁrm performance (Raisch &
Birkinshaw, 2008). Few studies delve more
deeply into how these two activities occur simultaneously. Of course, part of the how question
has to do with the actual capacities and behaviors
of individual members of the organization, rather
than with organizational arrangements and collective processes. Another key gap is the lack of
clarity about the levels of analysis in research on
exploration⫺exploitation. Recent theoretical
contributions ( Felin & Foss, 2005; Felin, &
Hesterly, 2007; Rothaermel & Hess, 2007)
identify two main problems with the singlelevel research approach. First, focusing on only
one level of analysis implicitly assumes that
most of the heterogeneity is located at that level
while other levels are more or less homogeneous. Second, this focus implies that this level
is independent of interactions with other loweror higher-order levels of analysis.
Another main concern with the current literature is the lack of agreement about key elements regarding the deﬁnitions of exploration
and exploitation. It is not clear from the literature whether exploration and exploitation
should be viewed as two ends of a continuum,
or as two different and orthogonal aspects of
organizational behavior. The central ambiguity
in the deﬁnitions is whether exploration and
exploitation differ in the type of learning or by
the presence/absence of learning (Gupta et al.,
2006). Table 1 summarizes some of the deﬁnitions that appear in key articles on the subject.

Exploration

Exploitation

Exploration includes elements captured by
terms such as search, variation, risk-taking,
experimentation, play, ﬂexibility, discovery,
and innovation.
The essence of exploration is experimentation
with new alternatives. Its returns are
uncertain, distant, and often negative.
Pursuit of what might come to be known.

Exploitation includes such things as reﬁnement,
choice, production, efﬁciency, selection,
implementation, and execution. The essence
of exploitation is the reﬁnement and
extension of existing competences,
technologies, and paradigms. Its returns are
positive, proximate, and predictable.
The reﬁnement and implementation of what is
known.
Exploitation is about creating reliability in
experience, and thrives on productivity and
reﬁnement.
Creates reliability in experience through
reﬁnement, routinization, production, and
implementation of knowledge.
“. . . and less-mindful behavior is akin to
exploitative behavior.”

Exploration is concerned with creating variety
in experience, and thrives on
experimentation and free association.
Variety in experience through search,
discovery, novelty, innovation, and
experimentation.
“Experimenting with a novel action implies
forgoing the use of existing, established
practices. In this sense, mindfulness
corresponds to exploratory behavior . . .”
Exploration activities are primarily carried out
through cognitive efforts aimed at
generating the necessary range of new
intuitions and ideas (variation), as well as
selecting the most appropriate ones through
evaluation and legitimization processes.
Exploration is rooted in variance-increasing
activities, learning by doing, and trial and
error; exploration creates futures that may
be quite different than the organization’s
past.
“the pursuit of new knowledge of things that
might come to be known.”

In order to avoid confusion, in this paper we
adopt a deﬁnition very close to the one provided
in neuroscience (discussed in Section 4) that
admits learning in both exploration and exploitation. We deﬁne exploration as the behavior
that includes search for alternatives and disengagement from the current task. The simplest
form of exploration is random search but other
more structured types of search, such as the use
of heuristics or explicit algorithms, are also
included. As a consequence of this behavior,
experimentation, ﬂexibility, discovery, and innovation are shown. We deﬁne exploitation as
the behavior that helps optimize task performance. When this behavior is present, there is a
high engagement with the current task. As a
consequence of this behavior, selection, reﬁnement, choice, production, and a concern with
efﬁciency are shown.
The fourth major gap in the received literature on the exploration⫺exploitation dilemma,

By contrast, exploitation activities rely more on
behavioral mechanisms encompassing the
replication of the new approaches in diverse
contexts and their absorption into the
existing sets of routines for the execution of
that particular task.
Exploitation is rooted in variance-decreasing
activities and disciplined problem-solving
exploitation builds on an organization’s past.

“the use and development of things already
known.”

and the one we focus on, concerns the role of
the characteristics of individual traits as mechanisms underpinning the development of organizational capabilities related to the balanced
management of exploration and exploitation activities. The roles of individual and group characteristics were viewed as an important and
necessary focus of scholarly attention since the
inception of the behavioral theory of the ﬁrm
(Cyert & March, 1963; March & Simon, 1958;
Simon, 1985). March (1991), for example, describes the cognitive limits that individuals encounter when trying to conduct explorative and
exploitative processes simultaneously. And
Tushman and O’Reilly (1996) argue, the ability
to explore⫺exploit at the organizational level is
facilitated by the top-management team’s internal processes.
It is only recently, however, that scholars
have started to empirically investigate team
characteristics that enable organizations to man-

age both exploration and exploitation (Beckman, 2006; Lubatkin, Simsek, Ling, & Veiga,
2006; McKenzie, Woolf, van Winkelen, &
Morgan, 2009; Mom, Van Den Bosch, & Volberda, 2009; Perretti & Negro, 2006; Smith &
Tushman, 2005). Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004,
p. 223), for example, note the “important role
played by senior executives in making an organization context effective and developing ambidexterity” (p. 223). Similarly, Smith and Tushman (2005) explore the integrative mechanisms
by which leadership teams might successfully
manage the contradictions that arise from structural separation in ambidextrous organizations,
and Volberda, Baden-Fuller, and Van Den
Bosch (2001) note that “top management explicitly manages the balance of exploration and
exploitation by bringing in new competencies to
some units while utilizing well-developed competencies in others” (p. 165). And at the group
level of analysis, Beckman (2006) ﬁnds evidence that the composition of the founding
team, and members’ prior company afﬁliations
in particular, is an important antecedent to
ﬁrms’ exploitative and explorative behaviors.
Unfortunately, the focus on team characteristics as the antecedents to the development of
organizational capabilities in ambidexterity is
not matched by studies on the role of managers’
individual characteristics or on the ability to
make balanced exploration⫺exploitation decisions. O’Reilly and Tushman (2004), for instance, emphasize the role of ambidextrous
managers with “the ability to understand and be
sensitive to the needs of very different kinds of
businesses” (p. 81). Despite a seeming consensus on the importance of the individual, the state
of the art in scholarly work on the individual
level of analysis shows a concerning paucity,
with the notable exception of Mom, Van Den
Bosch, and Volberda (2007). In our view, this is
an important concern, as many current “holistic” explanations might capture at least some of
what really are effects of variation at the individual level of analysis (Felin & Foss, 2005;
Felin & Hesterly, 2007). We explore this further
in Section 3.
The ExplorationⴚExploitation Dilemma in
the Manager’s Mind
Most studies of exploration⫺exploitation, starting with March’s (1991) seminal work, focus on

levels of analysis above the individual. March
(1991) analyzes the exploration⫺exploitation
trade-off in the social context of organizations,
focusing on two distinctive features: mutual
learning in the organization and the individuals
involved, and the competition for primacy
among organizations. Implicit in his model is
the assumption that the balance between exploration and exploitation is based on a turnover
process among a mix of individuals with different cognitive characteristics (some more inclined to exploration, others more inclined to
exploitation), who achieve a trade-off for the
whole organization.
The mechanism based on the turnover of
“cognitively specialized” (and inﬂexible) managers to achieve a balance between those predisposed to exploitative behavior and those predisposed to explorative behavior, however, is
clearly not the only one at the disposal of the
organization (the alternative, of course, is to
gather a group of managers who can think and
act in both modes with relative ease), and probably not even the optimal one. First of all,
having a group of cognitively specialized decision-makers will simply turn the decision into a
political battle between the two factions, with
results driven by the relative size and political
weight of the two factions, rather than to rational choice. Second, even when the decision can
be efﬁciently allocated to “explorationminded” or to “exploitation-minded” managers, this decision itself requires a decisionmaker (e.g., the CEO) with a signiﬁcant
amount of cognitive ﬂexibility to recognize
the advantages and disadvantages of the two
alternative allocations of the decision-making
responsibility. Essentially, the problem (and
the solution, via cognitive ﬂexibility) would
still be there, but would be upgraded to the
cognitive proﬁle of the person at the top of
the organization, who assigns the problem to
the cognitively specialized groups.
The alternative scenario of having cognitively nonspecialized (and ﬂexible) managers
might thus be superior to the one described
above, since it would reduce the likelihood of
political ﬁghts and suboptimal decisions and
would not require the presence of a “higher
order” decision-maker to assign the responsibility of the solution to “cognitively specialized” groups of managers. As O’Reilly and
Tushman (2004) recognized, “one of the most

<-----Page 4----->NEUROFOUNDATIONS EXPLORATION⫺EXPLOITATION DILEMMA

important lessons is that ambidextrous organizations need ambidextrous senior teams and
managers” (p. 81).
We thus propose that to achieve a better
understanding of how both exploration and exploitation can be conducted, we need an indepth examination of the microfoundations of
organizational learning. The micro—that is, individual—level of analysis may in fact account
for an important amount of heterogeneity in
decisional and performance outcomes, and
should be explicitly studied:
to fully explicate organizational anything—
whether identity, learning, knowledge or capabilities— one must fundamentally begin with
and understand the individuals that compose the
whole, speciﬁcally their underlying nature,
choices, abilities, propensities, heterogeneity,
purposes, expectations and motivations. While
using the term “organizational” may serve as
helpful shorthand for discussion purposes and
for reduced-form empirical analysis, truly explaining the organization (e.g., existence, decline, capability or performance), or any collective for that matter, requires starting with the
individual as the central actor (Felin & Foss,
2005).
Mom et al. (2007) were, to the best of our
knowledge, the ﬁrst to analyze the exploration–
exploitation dilemma at the individual level of
analysis. They explored the inﬂuence of knowledge ﬂows on the manager’s explorative or exploitative activities, recognizing that one of the
most promising avenues for future research is
“measuring exploration and exploitation at the
managerial level of analysis using objective
measures” (p. 927).
Along these lines of discourse, Section 4 discusses recent ﬁndings on the neuromodulation
of attention, which, we argue, is at the core of
the human ability to shift from one learning
mode to another. We provide some suggestions
on how to build on the concepts of situational
uncertainty, utility perception and attention focus to further investigation of organizational
exploration and exploitation.

underlying the exploration⫺exploitation trade-off.
Recent work on the neuromodulation of attention
proposes that interactions between the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), and the locus coeruleus (LC) (see
Figure 1) may modulate attention and thus balance exploration⫺exploitation (Aston-Jones &
Cohen, 2005; Cohen, Aston-Jones, & Gilzenrat,
2004; Usher, Cohen, Servan-Schreiber, Rajkowski, & Aston-Jones, 1999).
Traditionally, the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC-NE) system was considered to be implicated solely in arousal. However, multiple
recent ﬁndings suggest that this system plays a
more complex and speciﬁc role in the control of
behavior by contributing to the optimization of
behavioral performance (Sara, 2009).
Aston-Jones, Rajkowshi, Kubiak, and Alexinsky (1994) observe that the LC shifts between
two operating modes: the phasic and the tonic.
In the former, LC cells exhibit phasic activation
in response to the processing of task-relevant
stimuli, but display only a moderate level of
tonic discharge. This mode is consistently associated with enhanced attention focus, generating
“exploitative” behavior, deﬁned as behavior
that optimizes and achieves high levels of task
performance (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005). It is
important to note here that the analysis is at the
individual level. Exploitative behavior translates into a high level of engagement with the
current task. As a consequence, behaviors that
show reﬁnement in the selected actions and a
concern for efﬁciency are demonstrated.
In the tonic mode, LC cells do not respond
phasically to task events, but exhibit higher

levels of ongoing tonic activity. Exploration is
deﬁned as the behavior shown when there is
search for alternatives and disengagement with
the current task (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005).
This mode is associated with explorative behavior because it corresponds with poor performance on tasks that require focused attention,
and with increased distractibility. The simplest
form of exploration is random search, but exploration also includes more structured types of
search, such as the use of heuristics or explicit
algorithms. This behavior demonstrates abilities
for experimentation, ﬂexibility, discovery, and
innovation.
It should be noted that the deﬁnitions of exploration and exploitation provided by neuroscientists (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005) are
compatible with those in the management literature (see Table 1) and with March’s (1991)
deﬁnition: “The essence of exploitation is the
reﬁnement and extension of existing competences, technologies, and paradigms. Its returns
are positive, proximate, and predictable. The
essence of exploration is experimentation with
new alternatives. Its returns are uncertain, distant, and often negative.” (p. 81).
The ﬁndings on the functioning of the LC and
its consequent type of behavior are based on
two pieces of evidence. The ﬁrst comes from
experiments on monkeys, which transitioned
from a phasic to a tonic mode and then reversed
when the new target was identiﬁed. This transition requires that LC has the relevant information to determine when to switch between
phasic and tonic modes, an important aspect
that we address in the section on perception of
utility (Usher et al., 1999). The second piece of
evidence derives from studies of humans measuring pupil diameters—a good proxy for LC
activity—and functional MRI (fMRI) experiments (see Beversdorf, White, Chever, Hughes,
& Bornstein, 2002; Daw, O’Doherty, Dayan,
Seymour, & Dolan, 2006; and Sterpenich et al.,
2006; among others). Usher and colleagues
(1999) also develop a biophysically plausible
model of LC functioning that accounts for transitions between the phasic and tonic modes in
terms of a single physiological variable (coupling between LC cells) and explains the impact
of these shifts on task performance. In brief, the
model suggests that the phasic mode favors
exploitation by releasing norepinephrine (NE)
when a task-relevant event occurs, thereby fa-

cilitating the processing of that event, while
sustained release of NE in the tonic mode indiscriminately facilitates the processing of all
events irrespective of their relevance to the current task, thereby favoring exploration.
Viewed from the perspective of attention, the
LC phasic mode supports the current control state
(exploitation), while the LC tonic mode provokes
a withdrawal of control from the current task,
favoring the sampling of other behavioral goals
(exploration). These changes between phasic and
tonic modes are the basis for an understanding of
the exploration⫺exploitation dilemma from an attention perspective. When the utility derived from
a given behavior is low in comparison to expectations, ﬂexibility to change the attention focus,
and thus the behavior from exploitation to exploration, is needed to explore the environment and
sample different behaviors until new sources of
reward are discovered. This is the role played by
different modes of activity in the LC-ACC/OFC
system. Aston-Jones and Cohen (2005) observed
that the LC shifts between two distinct operating
modes, and that these shifts change attention and
then behavior. The LC phasic mode supports the
focus of attention on the current control state (exploitation), while the LC tonic mode provokes a
withdrawal of control from the current task, thus
favoring broader attention and the sampling of
other behaviors (exploration).1 The phasic LC responses facilitate context-congruent behavioral responses (exploitation) and the tonic mode of LC
facilitates sensitivity to different stimuli and the
execution of a broader class of behavioral responses (exploration).
These neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings on changes in
attention scope contribute to our understanding
of the management exploration⫺exploitation
dilemma from an attention perspective. The
idea that broad attention is important in situations that are dynamic, ill-structured, ambiguous, and unpredictable is acknowledged in the
management literature (Levinthal & Rerup,
2006; Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006). In the opposite
scenarios, the economies of narrow attention are
more appropriate and, through their reliance on
routines, can be cost-efﬁcient (Nelson & Win1

We should note here that, whereas we have described
the phasic and tonic modes as distinct, they likely represent
the extremes of a continuum of function. For expository
purposes it is more useful to distinguish them at the two
extremes.

<-----Page 6----->NEUROFOUNDATIONS EXPLORATION⫺EXPLOITATION DILEMMA

ter, 1982). As a consequence, the higher the
uncertainty in a situation, the higher the likelihood that broad attention—and thus explorative
behaviors—will lead to better performance.
However, these explanations still leave out
the important question of what information the
neural system uses to determine whether it
should exploit (LC phasic mode) or explore (LC
tonic mode). Studies have found that the brain
computes the perceived utility in a particular
situation, compares that with its expectation
levels, and drives shifts between LC phasic and
tonic modes by inﬂuencing simple physiological parameters (Usher et al., 1999). When low
expected utility is perceived, the broad mode of
attention (tonic mode of the LC functioning) is
activated. When high utility is perceived, the
focused mode (the phasic LC mode) is activated. Studies of humans (and neuronal records
in primates) show that the frontal cortex plays
an important role in the evaluation of utility.
Different areas of the brain are found to be
related to the assessment of rewards and costs.
A large number of neuroimaging studies, involving diverse experiments, have examined
brain responses to reward stimuli. They consistently identify a common set of neural structures
that are activated in response to these stimuli,
mainly the OFC, the ventral striatum, and the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The OFC has
been implicated in hedonic experience across all
sensory modalities (Rolls, 2000). Of speciﬁc
interest are areas in the striatum and the OFC
that are particularly responsive to rewards and
which change, accumulate, or are learned over
time (Knutson, Fong, Bennett, Adams, & Hommer, 2003; Koepp et al., 1998; Murray,
O’Doherty, & Schoenbaum, 2007).
Attempts have also been made to identify the
brain areas activated by cost-related issues. The
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is traditionally
considered to be directly responsive to aversive
interoceptive and somatosensory stimuli, and
particularly to pain (e.g., (Peyron, Laurent, &
Garcı́a-Larrea, 2000). Recent neurophysiological studies on monkeys and on humans have
consistently demonstrated that ACC is strongly
responsive to negatively valenced information,
such as performance errors, negative feedback,
monetary losses, and even social exclusion
(Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003),
and also to task difﬁculty and decision-making
conﬂicts (Botvinick, Cohen, & Carter, 2004).

101

Therefore, there is much evidence to suggest
that the OFC is involved in reward evaluation,
whereas the ACC is responsive to a variety of
negatively valenced signals (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005; McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, &
Cohen, 2004; Montague, King-Casas, & Cohen,
2006; Tom, Fox, Trepel, & Poldrack, 2007).
These results point to the existence of a strong
relationship between situation uncertainty and
utility perception. Thus, risk-averse individuals,
all else being equal, will ﬁnd higher utility in
less uncertain situations and, as a consequence,
will act under the phasic LC mode, showing
more exploitative behavior. In highly uncertain
situations, the opposite will occur. Individuals
will ﬁnd less utility in such situations and will
shift to a tonic LC mode, acting in a more
explorative way.
That perceiving a high utility reduces the
attention to search and exploration, and that the
perception of low utility promotes search and
explorative behavior, are fundamental tenets of
the behavioral school (Cyert & March, 1963;
March & Simon, 1958), a departure from standard neoclassical thinking, which assumes constant investment in search and exploration, independent of the current task. The “satisﬁcing”
behavior assumption has been widely tested in
and supported by management studies over the
decades (see Grève, 2003, for a recent review),
and by evidence on the impact of past performance on investment in attention and learning
by ﬁrms (Bateman & Zeithmal, 1989; Simon,
Houghton, & Aquino, 2000; Thomas, Clark, &
Gioia, 1993).
In addition, the perception of uncertainty has
been proposed as an important factor affecting
the evaluation of a given situation (McClure,
Gilzenrat, & Cohen, 2006; Yu & Dayan, 2005).
It seems that our brains distinguish between
expected and unexpected uncertainty. Two important neuromodulators—acetylcholine (ACh)
and norepinephrine (NE), respectively—signal
expected and unexpected sources of uncertainty. When exploiting, if prediction errors are
higher than expected, the current strategy
should be revised and we should explore. If, on
the contrary, the prediction errors can be accounted for in terms of expected uncertainty,
the exploiting strategy should be maintained. In
general, taking into account that individuals are
risk-averse, then the higher the unexpected uncertainty perceived in a situation or a problem,

<-----Page 7----->102

LAUREIRO-MARTÍNEZ, BRUSONI, AND ZOLLO

the more difﬁcult it will be for the individual to
understand the outcome of the situation/
problem and so the less the utility from the
situation.
The neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings summarized
above provide the basis for an understanding of
what underlies the exploration⫺exploitation dilemma. These ﬁndings also help to bridge some
of the gaps described in Sections 2 and 3. The
neuroscientiﬁc deﬁnitions of exploration and
exploitation, and the discovery of the neurological
mechanisms underlying the shift between the two
attentional states, help to resolve the debate over
whether exploration and exploitation are to be
viewed as positions on a continuum or as orthogonal situations. At the individual level of analysis,
they are clearly orthogonal, since at any given
moment an individual cannot be in both the phasic
and tonic modes of LC functioning. At the organizational level, however, members of a group
of individuals might be functioning in different
modes, which means that the group overall will
be working on a continuum between a completely phasic mode (all focused on the current
task, i.e., purely exploitative mode) and a completely tonic mode (all focused on exploration).
Of course, any group typically works at a position on the continuum located somewhere between the two extremes, but this position is

important to the prediction of collective behavior (see Figure 2). It is important that the (discrete) shifts in LC operating modes of individuals in the group over time will cause the group
position on the continuum to constantly shift.
In the next section, we offer a managerial
illustration of how these neurological mechanisms might inﬂuence the activities of groups

ExplorationⴚExploitation and the “Wizard
of Menlo Park”
How are the ideas presented in this paper reﬂected in a real case? In this section, we argue that
an organizational process of strategic relevance,
such as a product innovation process, can be decomposed in subactivities (explorative– exploitative behaviors) that are largely inﬂuenced by a
decision-maker’s attention focus (broad and narrow), which we expect to in turn originate from
neuromodulatory mechanisms guided by the LC.
We will exemplify the ideas we propose using the well-documented case of Thomas Alva
Edison— one of the most famous inventors of
all times—and the main events in one year

activities. Edison serves as a good case for
illustrating the ideas presented in this paper
relating to micro- and macrolevels of analysis
since he was not the “lone genius” but instead a
“collective noun and means the work of many
men” (Lindgren, 1979, p. 17 cited in Swedberg,
1993). While Edison was clearly at the head of
the Menlo Park operations, they were the result
of the collaboration and work of many individuals: the Park “apparatus” served to promote a
huge number of inventions (“a minor invention
every 10 days and a big thing every six months
or so” [Lindgren, 1979, p. 17 cited in Swedberg,
1993]), generating more than 400 patents in
its 6 years of operation. There is agreement on
the fact that Edison was a relentless innovator
or, closer to our argument, a “meta inventor.”
He made Menlo Park the cornerstone of modern
industrial research. The Park was the ﬁrst industrial laboratory concerned with both creating
knowledge and controlling new knowledge application. It is interesting to apply the ideas we
have integrated so far to the context of an R&D
lab, where not only research was done and
many new inventions were discovered, but also
the development, polishing, protection, and selling of the inventions was done.
Menlo Park demonstrated the ability to successfully combine both explorative and exploitative activities. Different inventors inside
Menlo Park were involved in both explorative
and exploitative activities, with Edison leading
their work in both cases. Edison’s high involvement in the different activities in Menlo Park
may have had some negative consequences for
the development of the incubator. On the other
hand, his role exempliﬁes how the way that
leaders attend to the particular problems of the
innovation process, facing the different decisions required to handle both explorative and
exploitative challenges, contributes to the success of the overall innovation process.
Not only was Edison working on many different projects at once, requiring different
modes of operation in his attention system, but
he also showed the ability to continuously shift
between the two cognitive modes within the
context of a single process. On the one hand he
could be very focused on advancing knowledge
development toward the solution of a very speciﬁc problem. On the other hand, he also recombined specialized knowledge from different

103

ﬁelds to generate new, broader subﬁelds and
more general knowledge.
How did he switch from one mode to the
other? In different innovation cases there is
evidence of the importance of specialization as
domain-speciﬁc expertise (Kaufman & Baer,
2006). Speciﬁc expertise is usually the foundation for building innovation. In addition, however, in Edison’s case (as in other cases studied
by Kaufman and Baer), general expertise played
a key role, along with the ability to recombine
knowledge from different ﬁelds, or to apply it
from one ﬁeld to another. As stated by Hargadon and Sutton (2000), Edison and the people in
his lab had the ability to “move easily in and out
of separate pools of knowledge, to keep learning new ideas, and to use ideas in novel situations” (p. 161). Like Alexander Graham Bell,
Samuel Morse, Henry Ford, and others, Edison
did not advance science in the way specialists
do. These scientists instead focused on and developed an in-depth knowledge about the speciﬁc issues (problems, components, etc.) of
their inventions, while also broadening and
bringing different streams of scientiﬁc discoveries into practical devices and systems (Skrabec, 2006). These serial innovators were sometimes able to explore, broaden their attention, be
creative, recombine and bring together different
ideas and also exploit, narrow down their attention, concentrate, and focus on solving a speciﬁc problem.
To illustrate, a detailed study by Carlson and
colleagues (Carlson, 2003, p. 155–156) shows
how Edison’s work on the microphone (the
carbon button transmitter for the telephone) can
be summarized as a series of contrasting behaviors in which “During certain periods, Edison
varied his lines of research, and then at particular moments, he appears to have selected one
line for further development” (p.156). His inventive patterns can be seen as characterized by
“explorative” periods (when he played out different lines of investigation) following by “exploitative” periods when he selected and focused by either choosing one of the lines or by
recombining the most promising lines.
Figure 3 summarizes the main activities Edison undertook while developing the microphone for the telephone during 1877. The ovals
show the moments when he chose which line to
proceed with (Diagram adapted from Carlson,

Edison’s lines of research for developing the telephone.

Edison was experimenting with different lines
(i.e., dragging, rubbing, etc.). He then chose to
focus on one option (i.e., the pressure telephone) to further improve it. Again, in September of that year, after having experimented with
different production models (i.e., resonance,
reed, etc.), he decided to focus on one option. In
this case he did not actually chose one, instead
combining the most promising results from different lines and focusing on developing a rubber
tube production version.
As documented in Carlson (2003, p. 152) this
particular situation can be analyzed as a speciﬁc
case in point:
“Edison or his associate James Adams substituted points of plumbago (i.e., graphite) for
the disks on his ‘squeeze’ telephone. These telephones seemed to work better than previous
versions, leading Edison to think more carefully
about using points. In particular, he now considered using four high-resistance points pressing on the diaphragm with varying degrees of
force. Edison noted an inverse relationship between the mechanical force and the electrical
resistance that the resistance increased as the
force decreased- and drew on this observation to
construct a pressure telephone in April 1877.”

A schema for interpreting this example in the
light of the ideas proposed in this paper is
presented in the Figure 4. The concentric ovals
signal the different sublevels at which the
exploration⫺exploitation dilemma can be seen
in the telephone example. At the center we
present the more micro level we have included
in our ideas (the LC mode), and the most external oval represents the more macro level we
have presented (the behavior at the organizational level). In the telephone example, Edison
started with an exploratory behavior searching
for alternatives (in this case ﬁve different ones)
and experimenting (adding the graphite points).
Edison got positive feedback from the environment, obtaining a good outcome (better working
telephones), which increased the utility and
lowered the uncertainty he perceived in the
problem at hand. Perceiving a higher utility, the
focused mode of LC functioning (phasic) arose
(see ﬁrst central box to the left). Edison started
focusing his attention (“think more carefully
about using points. . .” p.156) on one alternative
to improve it. He narrowed down from ﬁve
alternatives to the apparently best one to further
exploit the idea, develop and improve it (“he

chose to drop four lines in favor of the pressure
line” p. 156).
This shifting between exploring and exploiting was repeated several times in the telephone
invention and in several others. As can be seen
in Figure 4, as a result of the “squeezing” alternative, Edison focused his research on the pressure telephone. His shifts between exploring
and exploiting continued during the summer of
1877 (in Figure 4 see the box beginning with
“not convinced”). After deciding to focus on the
pressure telephone, Edison and his associates
faced a different problem: the quality of the
acoustic components was not satisfactory for
them (low utility perceived). Consequently, he
decided to undertake a search for better components (perceiving a low utility, he was under the
tonic LC mode and so broadened his attention).
The lab then extended their investigation to
different acoustic components (material search,
diaphragm, resonance cavity, reeds, springs,
ﬂuff) that were studied and tested (explorative
behaviors). Once higher standards were reached
(and so a high utility perceived) again a narrow-

ing-down process appeared in which Edison
combined the most promising results from the
different lines of research to create the rubber
tube production version of the telephone.
If we think about applying the schema in
Figure 2 to interpret—somewhat liberally—
Edison’s case, we can see that if we take a static
picture at a moment when Edison and his associates were exploring different lines, we may
see how their broad attention (resulting from a
tonic LC mode) reﬂected an explorative behavior at the individual level and aggregated also at
the organizational level. At other moments (as,
e.g., when narrowing down to one option
among the many explored) the more focused
attention (resulting from a phasic LC mode)
showed exploitative behaviors.
It is important, for our argument, there is no
evidence that Edison relied on different people
to allocate exploration- or exploitation-oriented
tasks, but that all the people involved in his labs
tackled both types of challenges. Having individuals capable of shifting easily from exploitation to exploration and back also allows a

<-----Page 11----->106

LAUREIRO-MARTÍNEZ, BRUSONI, AND ZOLLO

group to do so: aggregated at the organizational
level, the combination of explorative and exploitative behaviors is more likely to lead to an
adaptive behavior that swiftly moves between
the exploring⫺exploiting modes.
The Challenge of Measurement and
Empirical Validation
In applying neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings and techniques to management problems, we need to be
aware of some key epistemological differences
between these research programs. Neuroscientists, and neuroeconomists for the large part, are
interested in the average effects of their experimental manipulations in identifying the neural
correlates of a given process (e.g., a utility
evaluation) triggered by a homogeneous stimulus (e.g., increased levels of uncertainty) and
producing a set of possible, observable, decisional outcomes (e.g., a type of decision in a
game-theoretic scenario). Consequently, the
pursuit of these types of research questions and
the experimental designs generated tend to neglect individual variations around the mean response to the stimulus, and in fact consider
them a nuisance (Frederick, 2005), since the
larger the variance the weaker are the meanbased results.
However, as Lubinsk1 and Humphreys
(1997) note, a neglected aspect does not disappear because it is neglected, and there is no
good reason for ignoring the individual variation around a mean response, especially if we
have good logic to expect an important causal
link between managerial decision-making and
organizational performance, or, as in this paper,
between the allocation of attention as an antecedent of decision-making behavior and its consequences in organizational behavior and performance. As neuroscientists do, we should care
about what causes the average to work in a
certain way, but our focus must be on the
explanation of the differences: what might
lead certain individuals and their organizations to display diverse reactions to similar
stimuli, and consequently different levels of
performance? This basic difference in epistemological approaches implies some challenges to management researchers who need
to adjust some of the traditionally adopted
neuroscience research methods in order to
comply with their objectives.

A ﬁrst challenge is that testing for differences
requires a larger sample and implies higher
costs in terms of time, laboratory access, and
data processing. Also, the type of participants is
different: many applications of neuroscience to
economics, marketing, and ﬁnance use data
from college students. However, if we want to
understand differences in managerial decisionmaking behavior, it is necessary to sample managers, executives, and entrepreneurs of different kinds, with the aim of tracing differences
in the neural correlates that antecede their
behavior, and also to eventually be able to
correlate the results on individual characteristics with those of the organizations or
groups over which they exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence. Differences in age and experience
may shape the brain structure and the activations that can be observed. One interesting
setting for testing our ideas would be among
the entrepreneurs of small family enterprises.
In those organizations, as described by Bodmer and Vaughan (2009), the limited resources will possibly increase the impact on
the organizational moves of what the entrepreneur attends to and the cognitive maps he
does develop. Finally, replication is especially important in managerial studies since
contextual effects related to task features,
ﬁrm and sector characteristics, cultural traits
and institutional conditions may alter the way
individuals make decisions following the
same set of stimuli, and the way organizations
consequently perform.
Another distinctive feature of management
scholarship requires researchers to go beyond
uncovering what the effects of certain abilities
might be, and to attempt to understand how
these cognitive abilities can be developed and
used successfully to improve organizational performance, so that abilities—say the ﬂexibility
to shift attentional mode as soon as unexpected uncertainty levels change— can be diffused to beneﬁt organizational outcomes. One
of the key principles of behavioral neuroscience, in fact, is that experience can modify
brain structure long after brain development
is complete. Brain plasticity refers precisely
to the brain’s ability to change structure and
function. Experience is a major stimulant of
brain plasticity and works by producing multiple, dissociable changes in the brain including increases in dendritic length, increases (or

<-----Page 12----->NEUROFOUNDATIONS EXPLORATION⫺EXPLOITATION DILEMMA

decreases) in spine density, synapse formation, increased glial activity and altered metabolic activity (Kolb & Whishaw, 1998). Research on humans produced the interesting
result that “the plasticity of the nervous system remains throughout the life span and extends well into old age” (Taub, 2004). If the
antecedents to certain managerial abilities are
identiﬁed, it may imply that it might be possible to modify brain structure through different types of exercises and training, and thus
gain abilities relevant to improving managerial functioning following different experiences and at different ages.
To design a study for testing the neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings in a managerial setting it is necessary to create or adapt experimental tasks that
cover a series of steps corresponding to the
different constructs illustrated by the neuroscientiﬁc ﬁndings. An ideal option would be to
obtain direct measures of the managers’ attention focus while facing different real-life decisions and to correlate such measures with the
performance obtained out of those decisions
(both at a purely individual level and at an
organizational level) both in the short- and the
long-term. However, given the difﬁculty (or
impossibility) of measuring managers in the
real context with the actual brain imaging
tools, a good viable proxy would be to correlate the performance obtained, for example, in
managerial decision-making simulations facing the exploration– exploitation dilemma
with the precise attention focus measures obtained while completing different neuropsychological tasks in a lab context. There are
different alternatives that researchers could
follow to measure the ability of making decisions regarding exploring– exploiting, some
of which are also compatible with brain imaging techniques that could allow researchers
to measure not only performance in the
exploration⫺exploitation decisions (the observed behavior) but also the neural correlates
of such decisions.
We now turn to discuss how each of the key
constructs in this paper could be actually observed with the context of one speciﬁc task,
which can be administered using fMRI techniques: the gambling task (Daw et al., 2006).
To understand the antecedents of the decision-making ability related to managing the
exploration⫺exploitation dilemma, we have

107

proposed four constructs based on the ﬁndings
in neuroscience. The ﬁrst construct is the level
of uncertainty connected to a given decisional
situation. The ﬁrst step in the experimental design is thus to evaluate the manager’s perception of the uncertainty of the outcomes in the
task. This perception of uncertainty translates
into a utility assessment, the second construct. Different parts of the brain intervene in
utility assessment and, as we have shown, the
ACC and OFC play important roles. Depending on the manager’s assessment of utility in
the current task, an attention mode arises, the
third construct. As already explained, the LC
plays a fundamental role in modulating the
attention mode according to the perceived
utility. As a consequence of the attention
mode, the manager will then show a behavior,
the fourth construct. In the case of broad
attention (LC active in tonic mode), explorative behaviors arise and managers will act
(or will propose solutions) in ways characterized by experimentation, ﬂexibility, discovery, and innovation. In the case of focused
attention (LC active in phasic mode), exploitative behaviors will occur and managers will
act selectively, according to reﬁnement of
current processes and efﬁciency in the current
task. If the behavior matches what the situation demand (e.g., high uncertainty matched
with explorative behavior and low uncertainty
with exploitative behavior), higher performance can be expected.
It is important that the ability to balance
exploration⫺exploitation through ﬂexible management of the situational requirements to
achieve the appropriate attentional response can
only be assessed if the decision process is replicated under stable contextual conditions. This
adaptive process at the individual level can be
linked, and the link empirically tested, to the
organizational ability to balance the exploration– exploitation dilemma.
The four constructs we propose can be measured in an experimental context. These experiments involve two types of data. First, they
require data derived from behavioral measurements during experimental tasks (e.g., response
times, performance, etc.) and from questionnaires and interviews. Second, they require data
on brain functioning, which can be obtained

<-----Page 13----->108

LAUREIRO-MARTÍNEZ, BRUSONI, AND ZOLLO

during experiments by using brain imaging
techniques.2
The particular technique to be used can be
selected depending on the properties of
brain⫺behavior association to be observed. If
the study requires a high spatial resolution,
fMRI and PET will be required. If the study
requires high temporal resolution, EEG or MEG
would be suitable. A study that requires both
high temporal and high spatial resolution could
use a combination of these techniques (such as
fMRI or PET with EEG/MEG).
Gambling in the MRI Machine
An experimental task that could assess the
exploration⫺exploitation dilemma at the individual level and is compatible with the brain
imaging techniques just exposed is the gambling task as adapted by Daw et al. (2006). In
this experiment, participants play by choosing
among four slot machines, to win as many
points as possible. They are faced with the
classical exploration⫺exploitation dilemma in a
changing environment context. During the experiment different characteristics on the machines are manipulated (payoff average, uncertainty of returns, etc.) and participants must
choose whether to continue to play on a particular machine or explore new possibilities in the
hope of earning more points. While the individual is playing, her or his brain can be scanned
(e.g., using fMRI) to obtain measures for each
of the four constructs developed above. Of
course, the task could be done in a normal PC
and obtain only the behavioral performance
measures of exploration⫺exploitation decisionmaking, depending on the strategies and payoffs
obtained by the participant. Also important, the
software controlling the game allows a good
level of manipulation of the uncertainty level. In
addition, the utility perception and the attention
mode can be measured using brain imaging
techniques. Most management studies proxy for
attention by time allocated to an activity (e.g.,
the famous study by Mintzberg, 1973, whose
results were conﬁrmed by Kurke and Aldrich,
1983). Other studies proxy for attention by the
number of times a person refers to a certain
issue (e.g., the number of sentences in a shareholder letter referring to a speciﬁc element
(D’Aveni and MacMillan, 1990; Barr, Stimpert,
& Huff, 1992). However, the ideas we propose

do not require a measure for general attention;
rather, we want to differentiate between two
types of attention— broad and focused. The attention mode can be assessed by observing LC
functioning using a brain imaging technique
(e.g., the participants can play the task while
lying in the MRI scan) or by measuring pupil
diameter, found to correlate remarkably well
with LC tonic activity (Gilzenrat, Cohen,
Rajkowski, & Aston-Jones, 2003). The diameter of an individual’s pupils changes under various conditions. For instance, the pupil diameter
of someone who is thinking increases; the pupil
of a tired person shrinks. These effects have
been proven through a number of psychology
(Shinoda & Kato, 2006) and neuroscience experiments (Gilzenrat et al., 2003).
Finally, behavior can be observed based on
individual choices. In this way, one task could be
used to measure the decision-making performance
when facing the exploration⫺exploitation
tradeoff, and for manipulating and measuring the
different constructs that we have illustrated and
that affect such performance (uncertainty, perceived utility, attention focus). Table 2 summarizes how each construct can be deﬁned and measured in an experiment such as the gambling task.
This gambling task could be complemented
with other alternatives, such as simulation, decision-making vignettes and self-reported
scales, to have a more reliable measure. A treatment of all the available alternatives using these
techniques is out of the scope of this article, but
the authors will be pleased to provide a synopsis
and an assessment of results from ongoing empirical work to all interested scholars.

2
The basic set of techniques used to generate neurological images is electroencephalography (EEG), magneto encephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography
(PET), and fMRI. There are many limitations to the use of
these techniques: they are expensive to operate and results
are open to subjective interpretation. They are also intrusive
for subjects although to different degrees. EEG and MEG
are considered the least intrusive, while fMRI may cause
many subjects discomfort related to having to lie still in a
small space. Researchers must take the degree of intrusion
into account since it affects data gathering, particularly if
the subjects are busy managers and key decision-makers.
Nevertheless, these techniques offer by far the best physical
evidence to date on the activation of speciﬁc parts of the
brain consequent to given stimuli.

For the purpose of testing the ideas proposed
in this manuscript,3 the ﬁrst best option is certainly to correlate the direct measures of the
managers’ attention focus in different real-life
situations with the performance obtained in the
real decisions (both at a purely individual level
and at an organizational level) both in short- and
long-term. However, given the difﬁculty (or
impossibility) of measuring managers in real
situations with the actual brain imaging tools, a
good viable proxy would be to correlate attention focus measures obtained while performing
different neuropsychological tasks in a lab
context, with for example, managerial decisionmaking simulations facing the exploration–
exploitation dilemma. The performance measures obtained in these simulations can be
compared with the measures obtained in selfreported scales such as the cognitive ﬂexibility
scale (Martin & Rubin, 1995) or the recent scale
of exploration⫺exploitation activities by Mom
et al. (2009).
Conclusions
This paper addresses a dilemma common to
organizations. Managing the trade-off between
exploitation and exploration is fundamental to
adaptive behavior and learning in increasingly
complex and rapidly changing contexts. Although there has been much research on this
trade-off, there are still several key gaps in the

literature. First, we still know little about “how”
exploration and exploitation are actually done.
Second, the appropriate level of analysis at
which the exploration⫺exploitation tradeoff is
solved is not clear. Third, in many cases what is
meant by exploration⫺exploitation is not very
clear. Fourth, variation among individuals in the
tendency to respond in an exploitative or explorative way to a given stimulus, and on the
ability to shift their responses according to
changes in the environmental conditions, have
not been explored. To start addressing these key
analytical gaps, we thus propose a framework
and a method which, in our view, contributes
particularly to the microlevel problem of individual-level variance in behavior. We provide a
deﬁnition that is compatible with the management and the neuroscientiﬁc literature that we
are using. We focus on the individual as the
fundamental unit of analysis and study how
exploration and exploitation are done at the
micro, neurological level in terms of the processes going on in an individual’s mind and the
ensuing behavior when faced with a given environmental stimulus. Why does this framework
matter? We believe there are at least four pos3
While at the time of writing the study was still in its
infancy, at the time of publishing the ideas were implemented along lines consistent with those here discussed and
very promising preliminary results started to be obtained.

sible areas of contribution for the ideas put
forward in this paper.
“How” the Tradeoff Is Solved—a Micro
Perspective
As discussed earlier in this paper, there is still
a remarkable lack of clarity as to what is the
appropriate level of analysis for understanding
the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. At the organizational level, many have
focused on the attributes that make organizations more or less explorative (e.g., Tushman &
O’Reilly, 1996). Others have argued instead
(e.g., Papo, 2007) that individual-level processes ought to play a more central role in
understanding the origin of new ideas. Obviously, these issues are related. Yet, we still
know very little about how microlevel processes build up to organizational outcomes. We
used the example of Menlo Park’s activities to
argue that the crucial issue here is not that of
allocating exploitative versus explorative tasks
to those individuals or organizations which are
best suited to that task. Rather, our framework
points to the idea that what matters to balance
the tradeoff is not specialization, but the ability
of key decision-makers to shift seamlessly from
one task to the other, as we illustrated with the
process Edison enacted in one of his key innovations. At the organizational level, this argument is consistent with recent research on the
dynamics of innovation in complex technical
systems, which has warned against the dangers
of strategic outsourcing, often grounded in the
belief that exploitation and exploration are actually separate activities which can be attributed
to different types of organizations (e.g., Brusoni, Prencipe, & Pavitt, 2001). While there is
some evidence of the dangers of outsourcing
stemming from excessive specialization, microfounded explanations are in short supply. The
application of neuroscience to managerial decision-making offers important opportunities for
this line of inquiry to be developed to include
the study of interactions among individuals engaged in these high-level cognitive tasks, and
the generation of collective results that go beyond the sum of individuals’ capacities. While
the “aggregation” of individual capacities and
behaviors into organizational ones remains a
main limitation from the neuroeconomics ﬁeld
(Papo, 2007), this paper attempts, at least, to

identify similarities between micro- and organization-level processes which ought to be further
explored to generate sensible microfoundations
of macrobehaviors.
“How” the Tradeoff Is Solved—a Macro
Perspective
Domains that have traditionally focused on
macro-organizational analyses such as organization theory, strategy, and entrepreneurship
might beneﬁt from the development of a theory
of exploration and exploitation based on the
neurological processes occurring within individual managers’ brains.
For example, consider one of the basic insights in March’s (1991) seminal article, which
is related to the fact that exploration requires
heterogeneity in human capital, which disappears without constant personnel turnover because the newcomers learn the code and adapt
to the ﬁrm’s modus operandi. March concludes
(somewhat paradoxically) that the slower the
learning of the code, the higher the exploration
in the ﬁrm. However, the analysis in this paper
points to an alternative mechanism which does
not rely on personnel turnover to balance the
exploration⫺exploitation dilemma, but rather
focuses on the organizational members’ neurological characteristics, that is, their propensity
to function in tonic or phasic mode in the neuromodulation of their attention. It could be
speculated that a broad attention span caused by
the tonic activity of LC leads to a relatively
slower socialization process (i.e., learning of the
code) and thus more exploration at organizational level.
For scholars engaged in the study of entrepreneurship, our work offers the possibility to
theorize and empirically validate (with objective measures) insights related to the explanation of explorative decisions, which might generate the foundation of new ventures internal to
the ﬁrm (entrepreneurship) or outside it (spinoffs or start-ups). The launch of a novel enterprise can be viewed as the consequence of the
continuous allocation of attention to explorative processes, and the development of neurological foundations for such choices can be

reasons, strategy scholars might be able to
build on a better understanding of the neurological foundations of exploration– exploita-

tion decisions to develop models of strategic
choice based on the idiosyncratic characteristics of the strategy-makers, over and above
the inﬂuence of the industry context and the
organizational endowment.
Enhancing Attention Modulation
Third, and more practically, the framework
we propose in this paper might be used to develop teaching tools to foster individuals’ ability to control and properly shift the focus of
their attention. There is an element of plasticity
in the neurological processes we discuss here,
which can be leveraged to develop training programs to improve individuals’ responses to
changing environmental circumstances. Since
attention modulation affects the ability to properly make decisions regarding exploration–
exploitation, it will be then possible to adapt
some instruments which have been developed
for improving the attentional control (Sohlberg
& Mateer, 1989, 2001). Very interestingly, for
example, the analysis of the modulation of attention and its impact on decision-making
might open new venues in managerial and
entrepreneurial education through the development of tools and techniques which management students and practitioners can use to enhance their attentional control. These tools and
techniques can be very varied, ranging from
traditional in-class methods (e.g., for acquiring
awareness of perceptive biases) to mental control practices (as, e.g., neuroimaging studies
have demonstrated the positive impact of meditative practices on the improvement of functional up-regulation of brain regions affecting
attention control. For a recent review see Rubia,
2009). In addition, since many psychiatric disorders of higher level cognition are thought to
be due to deﬁcits of attention (Posner & Petersen, 1990) researchers could adjust the tools
used to treat patients of attention disorders to be
applied to managers aiming to improve their
attention control.
Reﬂection and Some Convergence Among
Different Domains
On a broader note, a fourth contribution aims
at reaching out to the now-broad crowd in social
sciences interested in exploring the neuroscien-

111

tiﬁc foundations of economic and organizational behavior. Social sciences are highly segmented in different knowledge domains. The
ﬁndings of our work might foster a more integrated discussion. For example, mainstream
economists might consider it interesting to
move beyond the replication of results based on
game theory, the focus of most neuroeconomics
work so far, to develop novel insights into the
neurological foundations of economic behavior.
Also, the shift toward the explanation of variance across individual traits and consequent behavior, as opposed to the characterization of the
mean tendency for the population of decisionmakers, might serve to correct a standard bias in
the discipline.
On the other side of the discipline’s fence,
evolutionary economists will appreciate our attempt to develop some of the microfoundations
of the work related to how ﬁrms learn and
evolve. The appropriate balancing of explorative and exploitative search is arguably a cornerstone of their theories. Depending on the
attention mode, a certain way to decompose the
problem will emerge and the search space will
be deﬁned accordingly. Search, therefore, is a
consequence of the attention mode. If the attention focus is broad, for example, problems will
be decomposed in broader modules, while a
narrow attention focus will result in problems
being decomposed in ﬁner modules. Brusoni,
Marengo, Prencipe, and Valente (2007) show
that the balance to this trade-off depends upon
the volatility of the problem environment. In
stationary environments there is an evolutionary
advantage to overmodularization, while in
highly volatile environments, contrary to the
received wisdom, modular search is inefﬁcient
in the long run. Similarly, we propose that in
low-uncertainty tasks, exploitative behavior
(i.e., deriving from a narrow attention mode and
involving high decomposition of problems)
would be advantageous, while the opposite will
be true in the case of highly uncertain tasks:
high decomposition is not efﬁcient and explorative behavior derived from broad search will
lead to better performance.
The organizational behavior ﬁeld, with its
orientation toward studying individual behavior
in ﬁrms, is the obvious audience for the ideas
discussed here. The main value for scholars in
this ﬁeld is that our ﬁndings expand their research agenda, which traditionally has been

<-----Page 17----->112

LAUREIRO-MARTÍNEZ, BRUSONI, AND ZOLLO

built on the application of social and cognitive
psychology, to include the novel insights and
methodologies developed in the neurosciences
which are applicable to the study of organizational behavior phenomena. While neurologically founded ﬁndings might in the end conﬁrm
what many have already argued on the strength
of sociometric surveys and psychological tests,
neurosciences might contribute by offering better theoretical foundations to understand exactly
why individuals behave in a certain way when
isolated, and how organizational life is impacted by their responses.
Also, neuroscientists might ﬁnd of interest
the application of recent ﬁndings about the
modulation of attention to the explanation of
economic behavior and performance. The empirical validation of conceptual advancement in
different decision-making settings and the
search for differences among healthy people
engaged in real-life, high-level decisions might
offer good opportunities for the development of
further understanding of the neural correlates of
some of the highest functions of the human
brain: the ability to search for novel approaches
to the solution of unstructured problems in natural settings.
Future Research
Of course, many other things might impact
individuals’ ability to shift their focus of attention. The framework we have discussed here
emphasizes the cognitive, rational elements of
response to stimuli at a given point in time.
Future research might explore other ways to
approach the exploration– exploitation dilemma. For example, the balance between exploration and exploitation seems to be sensitive
to time horizons, and humans show a greater
tendency to explore when there is more time left
for a task, presumably because it allows sufﬁcient time to enjoy the fruits of those explorations (Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles,
1999). Besides, individuals’ impulsivity or differences in perception of time inﬂuence decision-making (Wittmann & Paulus, 2009), and
so it would be useful to take the dimension of
time into account as the exploration– exploitation dilemma encompasses the anticipation of
future rewards. It would also be interesting to
explore how emotions affect the management of
the exploration– exploitation dilemma, since

subjects whose brain activity displays good cooperation between the limbic area of the brain
(emotional area) and the prefrontal cortex
(thinking area) are the most successful in games
based on experimentation (Bhatt & Camerer,
2005). Finally, future work could examine the
tendency toward exploiting rather than balancing exploring⫺exploiting from an impatient
behavior point of view, using the ﬁndings on
the neural correlates of time discounting
(McClure et al., 2004). As well as empirically
testing the model proposed here, these ideas
would provide a more complete understanding of the exploration⫺exploitation dilemma
at the micro level.
To conclude, it should be noted that the data
on brain functionality and the use of neuroimaging techniques have only begun to demonstrate their utility in complementing existing
data sources, deepening the microfoundations
of managerial behavior and developing better
tools for improving cognitive abilities. The
combination of novel empirical techniques and
the objective strength of neuroscientiﬁc evidence, free from typical limitations of subjective data collection processes, to ground the
theories of managerial behavior, demand increasing attention from management scholars.
This becomes even more important if we include the potential to contribute to the ultimate
goal of social science—as proposed by Glimcher and Rustichini (2004): the development of
a uniﬁed theory of human behavior, without
which the advancement of our understanding of
managerial behavior cannot progress.
