Summary

This research develops and investigates the concept of reciprocal trust between interacting
teams. Reciprocal trust is defined as the trust that results when a party observes the actions
of another and reconsiders one’s trust-related attitudes and subsequent behaviors based on
those observations. Twenty-four teams of systems analysis and design students were involved
in a 6-week controlled field study focused on the development of an information systems project. Each team was responsible for both developing a system (development role) and for
supervising the development of a system by another team (management role). Risk-taking
actions exhibited by one team in an interacting pair were found to predict the other team’s
trustworthiness perceptions and subsequent trust. The level of trust formed in turn predicted
the team’s subsequent risk-taking behaviors with respect to the other team. This pattern of
reciprocal trust repeated itself as the teams continued to interact over the duration of the project, thus supporting our model of reciprocal trust. Findings also indicate that trust and trust
formation can occur at the team level. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Introduction
Researchers from management and related fields agree that trust has important organizational and
interpersonal consequences (Argyris, 1964; Davis, Schoorman, Mayer, & Tan, 2000; Mayer, Davis,
& Schoorman, 1995; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990; Spreitzer & Mishra,
2002; Zaheer & Venkatraman, 1995). While much is known about trust, several areas can benefit from
additional attention. Few studies have empirically examined trust between parties over time (Lewicki
& Bunker, 1995). This scarcity is understandable, considering the inherent complexities of longitudinal research. However, given the apparent relationship between trust and organizational performance,
it is important to understand how trust is nurtured and eroded as parties interact. In addition, the question of whether or not teams can exhibit trust remains an open research question. Although trust

research focused on individuals is important, groups and organizations are more than collections of
individuals. Hence, research also needs to address the development of trust in these more complex
social settings.
This study contributes to the growing literature on trust by examining team-based trust in a longitudinal context. In addition, this research defines and develops the concept of reciprocal trust using an
established theoretical framework (Mayer et al., 1995) by examining whether one party’s actions influence the level of trust formed in another party. This research extends prior findings by examining the
dynamic interplay of the determinants of trust over time. We also differentiate reciprocal trust from the
concept of mutual trust—two concepts that on the surface appear similar. We focus specifically on
trust at the interteam level of analysis. Examining trust at the group level of analysis is in line with
calls for research (Klein, Dansereau, & Hall, 1994; Mossholder & Bedeian, 1983; Rousseau, 1985)
that have stressed the importance of isomorphism—consistent construct conceptualizations across
levels of analysis—to facilitate multilevel and cross-level inferences. Other researchers have noted
that although conceptually clear multilevel work on trust is needed, an understanding of trust in an
organizational context is being hampered by a lack of such clarity in published studies (Currall &
Inkpen, 2002). By validating the Mayer et al. (1995) model at an interteam level, we facilitate future
multilevel and cross-level work.

Trust
A foundation for this study is the Mayer et al. (1995) framework for trust. This model posits that trustworthiness, in the form of beliefs about another party’s ability, benevolence, and integrity, are the predominant determinants of trust. Mayer et al. (1995) also posit that trust can result in risk-taking—i.e.,
behaviors that open the trustor up to the possibility of loss—which they label ‘risk-taking in relationship.’ Consistent with the Mayer et al. (1995) model, we define trust as ‘the willingness of a party to be
vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular
action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party’ (Mayer
et al., 1995, p. 712). ‘Party’ can refer to a group, allowing the definition to be employed for our purposes.
By defining a group’s trust in another group as a willingness to be vulnerable to that group, trust is
differentiated from both perceptions of the other team (i.e., trustworthiness) and from the risk-taking
behaviors which may occur for reasons other than trust. Mayer et al. (1995) emphasized the importance of making this differentiation. The willingness to be vulnerable can manifest itself in a variety of
risk-taking behaviors dependent upon the context. In an investment situation, trust may result in relinquishing control of personal resources to a financial planner. In personal relationships, trust may result
in disclosing sensitive information. In our context of interacting teams in a project development environment, trust may result in other behaviors which we discuss more completely below. It is important to
note that if trustworthiness perceptions of the other party change, a party’s willingness to be vulnerable—i.e., trust—may be immediately affected. On the other hand, it takes time for a change in trust
to manifest itself in a different level of risk-taking behavior.

Team trust
The majority of trust research has focused on an individual as the trustor of interest. While examining
individuals is interesting and important, we explore whether or not a team as a whole can exhibit trust.
Indeed, Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis (1996b) stress the importance of extending trust to the group
and organization levels of analysis and call for additional research specifically targeting this important

topic. Consistent with the model presented by Mayer et al. (1995), a group’s trust for another can be
thought of as a shared belief by members of a focal group about how willing that group is to be vulnerable to a target (i.e., trustee) group. Previous studies have proposed that trust can occur at both the
group and organizational level (Currall & Judge, 1995; Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998), although
empirical confirmation has been needed. Moreover, interorganizational trust was described by Zaheer
et al. (1998) as a collectively held trust orientation toward the partner firm. This latter view is consistent
with the approach to intergroup trust taken in this paper.
This shift from interpersonal to interteam trust is significant for at least two reasons. First, interacting teams have become common. Thus, understanding how to nurture effective interactions between
teams is critical to performance. Second, groups are not simply collections of individuals—they exhibit characteristics reflective of the whole. Thompson and Fine (1999) showed that groups have been
dealt with theoretically as supraorganisms for many decades (e.g., McDougall, 1920). In this and other
work, Thompson and her colleagues note that the use of the group as a unit of analysis as an information processor has become accepted in organizational research. As she states in the introduction to a
special issue of Basic and Applied Social Psychology, ‘the unit of analysis is no longer the individual
information processor . . . but the interacting group and dyad . . . . [The focus of the special issue is]
how interacting individuals and groups create meaning and act upon collectively developed cognition,
motivation, and emotion’ (Thompson, 1998, p. 3). Trust may be one of the characteristics that are influential in group and inter-group performance.

Reciprocal trust
While previous research has examined both the antecedents and consequences of trust, fewer studies
have explored whether existing trust (and its behavioral consequences) has a role in establishing
another party’s trust over time—in effect, demonstrating that trust may beget more trust (Das & Teng,
1998). Reciprocity may be critical in understanding trust in relationships (Blau, 1964). Trust forms in
the mind of the trustor. It cannot be observed by others, and therefore cannot directly affect either perceptions held by or behaviors of other individuals or groups. The risk-taking behaviors that are
believed to result from trust are evident to others, however, and it is these behaviors that may provide
the stimulus that can encourage subsequent demonstrations (both positive and negative) of trust in
return (Boon & Holmes, 1991; Rempel, Holmes, & Zanna, 1985). Research that examines the development of trust in virtual teams, for example, concluded that one team’s actions affected another
team’s subsequent perceptions of trust (Jarvenpaa & Leidner, 1999).
In addressing the trust that occurs between parties, the concepts of mutual trust and reciprocal trust
have overlapped. We assert that mutual trust is conceptually different from reciprocal trust. Mutual
trust exists when two people have complementary trust for one another, and when each perceives that
the other is aware of his intent and his trust (Deutsch, 1958). Under mutual trust, researchers assume
that each party has roughly the same level of trust for the other party (Nelson & Cooprider, 1996; Ring
& Van De Ven, 1994). Mutual trust also presents a static picture of complementary trust without
addressing how actions and context have affected present levels of trust.
To reciprocate, however, means ‘to give and take mutually; to show or feel in response’ (Webster,
1984, p. 584). Reciprocal trust implies an active process of exchange of trust between parties, particularly when it results from a trustee’s previous demonstration of trust. Equivalence is not a requirement of reciprocal trust. We define reciprocal trust as the trust that results when a party observes the
actions of another and reconsiders one’s attitudes and subsequent behaviors based on those observations. Our concept of reciprocal trust is not a distinct type of trust, but rather it is a dynamic process
through which trust grows or diminishes. Describing reciprocal trust requires examining the process by

which actions result in trust between interacting parties. This requires the measurement of one party’s
actions, and the measurement of another party’s trust-related reaction to those actions. It is important
to note that the focus of this study is the reciprocal nature of trust between interdependent teams.
Although the intragroup dynamics through which a group’s level of trust is formed are also of great
interest, examination of that process is beyond the scope of this research.
Figure 1(a) illustrates a conceptual model of reciprocal trust between teams based on the Mayer trust
model (Mayer et al., 1995). Within a specific context (e.g., interacting teams involved in a systems

development project), Team A perceives Team B to have some level of trustworthiness, which results
in Team A’s level of trust in Team B. Team A subsequently takes a risk by performing an action that
results in its being vulnerable to Team B. Such actions have been called ‘risk-taking in relationship,’ or
RTR (Mayer et al., 1995). The RTR increases or decreases Team B’s perceptions of Team A’s trustworthiness, depending on whether Team A’s action is perceived positively or negatively. Team B
responds by updating its prior perceptions of A’s trustworthiness, and increasing or decreasing its trust
and RTRs with respect to Team A. This constitutes an action–reaction cycle where both Team A’s and
Team B’s trust can be influenced by each other. In this way, one team’s trust and resultant risk-taking
behaviors may encourage future trust and risk-related actions of another team.
This concept of action–reaction is well documented in the complementary field of game theory
(Axelrod, 1984). What game theory ignores, however, are the beliefs that motivate the actions and
reactions. Game theory research equates cooperation with trust. Cooperation can, however, exist without trust (Mayer et al., 1995). Trust can breed cooperation in circumstances where other means of producing cooperation (e.g., the use of coercion) are not possible or are likely to be unsuccessful. Thus, it
is important to distinguish between the two. Unlike game theory research, the current study examines
not only behaviors but also considers the perceptions and attitudes that underlie the behaviors.

Study Overview and Hypotheses
Our context for studying the evolution of trust between interdependent teams involves two interdependent teams interacting on a systems development project. Within the project, a development team provides a solitary source of technical knowledge for a management team who must rely on the
development team to construct the solution. The management team is also a unique source of important information, since it provides the initial requirements and feedback that allow the development
team to successfully complete its job. The management team on the project sets forth requirements
and is responsible for overseeing a development team charged with the construction of an information
system.
We propose three hypotheses and test them over four time periods, each of which lasts about 10 days
(Figure 1b). Figure 1(b) illustrates the same information as the feedback model illustrated in
Figure 1(a), but introduces time periods into the representation. The first two hypotheses are designed
to confirm the Mayer et al. (1995) model of trust extended to the team level of analysis. Specifically,
the first hypothesis examines whether the trustworthiness factors (i.e., ability, benevolence, and integrity) predict team trust. The second examines the effect of trust on later risk-taking actions specific to
the project management context. The third hypothesis focuses on reciprocal trust by examining
whether the actions of one team relate to the perceptions of its trustworthiness held by the other team.
These hypotheses are discussed more thoroughly below.

Trustworthiness hypothesis
Mayer et al. (1995) posits that three primary factors—ability, benevolence, and integrity—can parsimoniously encompass the concept of trustworthiness, the immediate precursor to trust. This particular
framework has been used by numerous other researchers studying the antecedents of trust (Bauer &
Green, 1996; Robinson, 1996). Previous research, for example, has indicated that trust in another is
influenced by perceptions of the other party’s ability to accomplish a task important to the trustor,

where ability is the set of skills or attributes that enable the trustee to have influence (Butler, 1991;
Cook & Wall, 1980). Thus, exhibited ability can be expected to positively influence trust because
the trustee will be perceived to have more capacity to help the trustor. In turn, benevolence is the
degree to which the trustor believes that the trustee has goodwill or positive intentions toward the trustor (Larzelere & Huston, 1980; Whitener, Brodt, Korsgaard, & Werner, 1998). Similar to ability, the
more a trustee exhibits behaviors that show they value the trustor’s needs and seek to protect the trustor, the greater the resulting trust on the part of the trustor should be. Finally, integrity is a trustor’s
perception that the trustee adheres to acceptable values, which could include issues such as consistency, honesty, and fairness. A trustee who shows that they follow values that the trustor likes should
be more trusted. Other researchers have also proposed that factors similar to integrity play a role in
trust (Butler, 1991; Lieberman, 1981; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). Based on this rationale, we propose:
Hypothesis 1: One team’s perceptions of another team’s ability, benevolence, and integrity will predict the first team’s trust in the second team.

Risk-taking in relationship hypothesis
Mayer et al. (1995) also proposed that trust leads to behavioral consequences. These risk-taking behaviors make the trustor vulnerable to the trustee. As mentioned earlier, the consequences of trust (i.e.,
the specific RTRs) are dependent upon the context in which trust is studied. Since this research focuses
on the relationships between teams interacting in management and development roles in a systems
development project, risk-taking behaviors specific to this management team–development team context are identified and developed.
For the development team role, we explore two types of risk-taking behaviors that can result from
trust in this context: formalizing and scoping. Development teams may reduce their perceived risk by
formalizing communications regarding project-related outcomes and procedures such as requiring a
project charter, project schedule, and resource assignments. Project documentation, change request
forms, or public staff meetings can serve as a contract, protecting developers from exposure to risk
(Bozeman & Kingsley, 1998). We posit that since formalizing communication reduces risk (documentation allows a team to prove what was planned or discussed), development teams who do not trust
their management teams will formalize more. Another common method used to reduce project risk
is to control the project’s scope by restricting a management team’s capacity to change project specifications. Allowing project requirements or specifications to expand beyond initial expectations
(known as ‘scope creep’) is a primary cause of unmet deadlines and budgets (Abdel-Hamid &
Madnick, 1991; Zmud, 1980). While related to formalization, project scope control activities keep
the requirements of the project in line with estimated time and resources so that the development
team’s efforts will be judged a success. A development team that trusts its management team should
exert less effort to protect itself from increases in scope, which increases its project risk by not meeting
time or budgetary goals.
For the management team role, we examine two types of risk-taking behaviors that would be a consequence of trust in this context: monitoring development team progress and delegating tasks to the
development team. Researchers have proposed that trust in business relationships can reduce the need
for monitoring (Shapiro, Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992). In one study, researchers found that veterinarians delegated riskier tasks to employees in whom they had more trust (Schoorman, Mayer, &
Davis, 1996a). Others have also proposed similar effects of trust (Fox, 1974). Thus, in a project
management context, if a management team trusts its development team, it should delegate more
risky tasks to the development team—such as delegation of decision-making regarding the design

<-----Page 6----->THE RECIPROCAL NATURE OF TRUST

631

of a project deliverable or greater discretion over the amount of communication expected to keep management informed. A second type of risk-taking action is the extent to which one party monitors
another (Bromiley & Cummings, 1996; Fox, 1974). Computer-based monitoring, for example, has
become common in the workplace, especially if management believes employees are using company
time inappropriately (George, 1996). Such monitoring may result from management’s lack of trust in
the employees. Previous management research has found that trust is negatively related to controlbased monitoring (McAllister, 1995). In our information systems development project, management
teams that do not trust their development team should monitor more since they will likely feel the need
to oversee the developers’ progress.
In sum, we hypothesize that a team that trusts its counterpart team will act in a way that may put it at
risk to the other team. It should be noted that in some instances increases in risk-taking actions should
be reflected in increases in certain types of behaviors, although in other instances increases in risktaking may cause decreases in a behavior. For example, increases in management’s trust may lead
to RTRs like increased delegation of tasks to the development team, or reduced monitoring of development team actions. In sum:
Hypothesis 2: Team trust will be positively related to its risk-taking actions toward the trusted team.

Reciprocal trust hypothesis
As discussed earlier, trust itself is not visible to the interacting teams. The process of reciprocal trust
occurs, however, as a team observes the behaviors of another team and perceives them as a signal of
trust. The observing team then modifies its perceptions of the first team’s trustworthiness (ability, benevolence, or integrity). These perceptions immediately influence the second team’s trust in the first team,
which in turn affects the second team’s own RTRs. These behaviors are observed and interpreted by the
first team, and the cycle continues. As explained by Das and Teng, ‘When a trustee realizes that a trustor
has taken considerable risk in trusting her, she tends to be motivated to behave in a trustworthy manner’
(Das & Teng, 1998, p. 503). This research posits that the best explanation of the mechanism for reciprocal development of trust is through the linking of one team’s RTRs to another team’s trustworthiness
perceptions (i.e., perceptions of the trustee’s ability, benevolence, and integrity). The reciprocal nature of
‘I trust you because you trust me’ (McAllister, 1995) will continue as long as teams continue to interact.
A more concrete illustration may be useful. If a management team does not trust a development
team, it may more closely monitor the progress made by the development team (monitoring) to avoid
taking a risk at the development team’s hands. Interpreting these actions as a lack of trust, the development team may attempt to protect itself, including formalizing communications (so messages are
not lost) and requiring detailed change requests as a form of project scope control (so the development
team reduces its risk of falling behind schedule, even at the expense of a more suitable systems development effort). These development team behaviors may be interpreted by the management team as
indicators of reduced development team ability, benevolence, or integrity (the factors of trustworthiness), which in turn decreases the management team’s trust in the development team. Such a reciprocal
process could continue through the life of a project, as trust is developed or eroded through multiple
interactions. It should be noted that actions may be interpreted differently depending on the context in
which they occur. For example, increased scoping may be viewed as acceptable and professional early
in a project, but may be interpreted negatively later in a project. We propose:
Hypothesis 3: One team’s risk-taking behaviors will be related to the other team’s perceptions of the
first team’s trustworthiness.

Organizational Context

The Sample
Data were collected in a senior-level systems analysis and design class taken by students who had
elected to minor in management information systems while majoring in another business discipline
(accounting, marketing, operations, finance, or management). The MIS minor program is considered to be one of the élite programs within the business college. Admittance to the MIS minor is
competitive: students must have a 3.0 GPA to be admitted to the program. Students tend to be highly
motivated, and recruiters often seek out these students for their top positions. Placement information indicates that the majority of the students took positions in the accounting, consulting, and
financial services industry within the mid-Atlantic region.
The Team Task
In addition to teaching the basics of systems analysis, an objective of the class is to encourage teamwork and to develop students’ project management skills. The development project used in this
class—where students were charged with not only developing an information system, but also
supervising the development of another team’s system—was a unique approach to educating students on the intricacies of the systems development process. By having each student team perform
the roles of developers and managers, students reported that they learned important development
skills, but also understood the development process from the manager’s perspective. They also better understood the importance of communicating using models and diagrams, for example, because
managers often do not understand technical jargon. Despite the complexity and added work necessary for students to participate in the project, evaluations of the course—and its learning opportunities—were quite high.
Timeline
Data were collected over a 6-week period in 2000.

Methods
The purpose of this study is to examine the development of reciprocal trust between teams. The nature
of this goal introduced several complexities. Our desire to control for task complexity across teams and
to randomly assign participants to teams suggested the use of an experimental design. Two key concerns, however, have been raised about the efficacy of studying trust in a traditional laboratory setting
(Schoorman et al., 1996b). First, the development of trust may be best studied when repeated interactions occur over a sustained period of time, so that participants have time to develop a meaningful level
of trust. Second, participants must be engaged in a way that is important and salient to them—i.e., for
trust to matter participants must have something valuable to gain or to lose. For this study, a setting and
methodology was needed that could gain much of the control available in a lab setting while engaging
interdependent teams over a significant period of time in a realistic, salient task in which they had a
stake in the outcome.

Project task
The task chosen for this study was the development of a system (i.e., a website) in a senior-level information systems analysis and design class. Ninety-four advanced undergraduate students in two sections of a public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States participated in this
study. Students were randomly assigned to one of 24 teams: 22 teams consisted of four students
and two consisted of three students. Each team was responsible for both developing a system (development role) and supervising the development of a system by another team (management role). Thus,
our sample included 22 separate project team dyads.
We tailored the research design to provide an environment conducive to studying trust over time.
The teams were mutually dependent upon one another for success, so each party had something to lose
or gain. Teams were engaged in a significant, real project from their perspective, so potential losses and
gains were salient. The environment was as tightly controlled as possible, reducing the effects of extraneous variables (e.g., lay-offs, new management). Finally, there was sufficient interaction over a prolonged period of time (approximately 40 days) to develop a meaningful level of inter-team trust. Teams
had both face-to-face interactions and the other team’s project deliverables to provide information for
evaluating trustworthiness.
The team structure for the class resembled a circle, with a given team (e.g., Team 2) managing
another team (e.g., Team 3) on one project and being managed by yet another team (e.g., Team 1)
on a second project. In its managerial role, a team was responsible for establishing requirements for
the required system and for providing feedback to the development team. In its development role, the
team was charged with fulfilling the management team’s requirements by constructing an information
system. The development project lasted about 6 weeks. Four project deliverables were exchanged by
the interacting teams over the course of the project, one every 10 days.
Although a team in the managerial role depended on its development team to produce a technology
solution that met its specifications, the development team depended on its management team to provide clear and timely specifications, accurate feedback on progress, and recognition and rewards for
performance. Each team’s project grade depended in part on the other team’s performance. This field
design within a university class provided certain advantages by allowing for a level of control not
available in a corporate setting. Participants were randomly assigned to teams. The sample was relatively uniform in terms of experience, such as students’ technical knowledge and grade point averages.
The basic interaction between management teams and development teams was standardized across
dyads, which gave each team an equal amount of time to accomplish each project phase.
The management team delivered a requirements document to the development team at T1. The
document outlined the requirements for the project, and was read and assessed by the development
team. At T2, the development team delivered a system prototype to the management team, which
examined it relative to the initial requirements. At T3 the management team delivered a feedback
document to the development team, proposing changes to the system prototype. This feedback document was read and assessed by the developers. Finally, at T4 the development team delivered the final
system. The management team examined the final product relative to both the initial requirements and
the change requests from T3.
Our analysis of trust follows this flow of project deliverables. As a deliverable is presented from
Team A (which can be either the management or developer team role depending upon the stage of
the project) to Team B, the deliverable and the interactions that transpired between the two teams
as the deliverable was constructed affect Team B’s perceptions of Team A’s ability, benevolence,
and integrity. These Team B beliefs have an immediate impact on Team B’s trust, and subsequently
on the risk-taking actions that Team B exhibits (Mayer et al., 1995). Teams submitted their deliverables
at the start of class and the instructors provided time in class for teams to review and discuss the

submitted deliverables. The instructors did not restrict teams from interacting outside of class. We
instituted a number of steps to mitigate dependence in the responses representing the two roles. For
each of the 24 teams, the instructor identified which team was being evaluated. Researchers were careful to space out survey administrations to reduce methods bias. Instructors also emphasized to the students the importance of completing the surveys honestly and accurately, since they would be
considered in determining a team’s final project grade.
Our model (Figure 1b) hypothesizes that a team’s actions (in the form of the deliverables and actions
related to the deliverables) inform subsequent perceptions of ability, benevolence, and integrity from
the other team. These trustworthiness perceptions immediately trigger changes in the other team’s trust
level, which then affect that team’s RTRs throughout the next stage of the process. Since the delivery of
the requirements document provides an indication of the management team’s initial trustworthiness
(and hence, a basis for the development team’s initial trust in the management team), our model starts
with the development team’s perceptions of the management team’s ability, benevolence, and integrity
after its review of the requirements document. It should be noted that management RTRs at T1 would
have reflected management’s monitoring and delegating actions leading up to the delivery of this

To measure perceptions of ability, benevolence, and integrity, three questions were adapted from previous trust research (Mayer & Davis, 1999). Both management and development teams answered identical questions with the referents modified accordingly (see Appendix). For ability, benevolence, and
integrity, each team member responded to questions that asked about that team’s perceptions of these
qualities in the other team. Measures of RTRs for the task at hand were developed for this study based
on interviews with systems developers and IT managers. The developer RTRs included formalizing
inter-team procedures and scoping (attempting to control the scope of) the size of the project. Management RTRs included delegating and monitoring. All scales in this study used a 5-point Likert-type
format with agree–disagree anchors at each scale point. Both management and development teams
completed surveys whenever a project phase was completed.
The internal validity of the study was bolstered in a number of ways. Data were collected from both
management teams and development teams at points that corresponded to the times that either the
management team (T1 and T3) or the development team (T2 and T4) submitted a project deliverable
to its counterpart team. Unlike earlier published research on mutual or reciprocal trust, the longitudinal
and repeated nature of the data collection allowed us to examine the interactive evolution of trust
between interdependent teams over a 6-week time period. Our analyses involve both cross-source
and longitudinal relationships. RTR–trustworthiness relationships involve cross-source data. At T2,
for example, RTRs represent a development team’s responses of its actions in the previous time period.
The trustworthiness responses represent the management team’s perceptions of the development team.
Relationships between trust and subsequent RTRs involve longitudinal data, since the perceived trust
at the end of one time period (e.g., T2) should foster action during the subsequent time period (and
therefore measured at the end of T3). This design should mitigate concerns about the effects of common methods bias.
Reliability and validity estimates were completed using individual level data (n ¼ 94). Correlations
and descriptive statistics are listed in Table 1, along with Cronbach’s alphas. Reliability levels were
acceptable for the most part (i.e., greater than 0.70), although the new formalizing (T2 and T4) and
scoping (T2) RTR scales were lower than expected. Previous studies have recommended a lower reliability standard (0.60), however, for exploratory measures (Nunnally, 1978). The lower levels for the

RTRs are likely also due in part to the brevity of the scales. Cronbach’s alpha for the trust scale at T1
was also low, possibly indicating that trust perceptions had not yet been solidified this early in the project. These variables were retained, but the reliability levels may reduce our ability to detect relationships with these constructs (Nunnally, 1978).
Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to determine the constructs’ underlying measurement
characteristics at the individual level (Table 2). Because trustworthiness and risk-taking indicators are
likely to covary within each analysis (McKnight, Choudhury, & Kacmar, 2002), we used an oblique
rotation (oblimin direct) to facilitate factor interpretation. Each group of indicators (trustworthiness,
trust, and RTR) was run in separate analyses for each time period. The KMO (Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin)
statistic was included to test the adequacy of our sample for factor analysis: values greater than or
equal to 0.50 are considered acceptable (Chow, 2004; Ferguson, Sanders, O’Hehir, & James, 2000;
Hughes et al., 2003). All KMO levels pass the 0.50 level. We also included Bartlett’s chi square statistic, which tests the null hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identity matrix and therefore
inappropriate for factor analysis. The null hypothesis is easily rejected for all analyses.
We next examined the magnitude and nature of the factor loadings. Trustworthiness and RTR factor
loadings all exceed accepted standards (>0.50). Trust factor loadings are also acceptable, except for
one loading at T4. Based on these results, we conclude that our trustworthiness, trust, and RTR measures demonstrate acceptable convergent and discriminant validity.
One of the issues in studying team trust relates to how trust at the group level is best measured. There
are at least three options. The first is to allow members of a group to come to a collaborative unanimous
decision, and then answer questions on trust as a group. Although this does indeed force a group-level
answer, social influence issues like domination or coalitions may bias the results. A second commonly
used option is to ask questions at the individual level and subsequently aggregate to a higher level
(Van Der Vegt, Emans, & Vliert, 2001). This technique is problematic as well, however, since the mean
(or median) response may not be a valid indicator of the team’s collective perception. In this latter scenario, valuable information about perceived group beliefs is lost, as a given member may personally hold
one set of beliefs while recognizing that the group itself shares beliefs that differ from the members’.
For measuring shared team properties, a third alternative has been proposed (Klein & Kozlowski,
2000). Instead of aggregating questions posed at the individual level, this approach recommends wording
questions using the team as the referent, not the individual. Each respondent becomes a data source,
reporting not on his or her own beliefs, but on what he or she perceives the team to believe. Second, it
is necessary to demonstrate substantial within-group agreement. If these two standards are met, the data
should be aggregated to the team level of analysis to represent the shared team construct. This method of
measuring group attitudes is consistent with an extensive body of literature focused on group potency
(Gibson, 1999) and collective efficacy (Crocker & Luhtanen, 1990; Gibson, 1999; Shamir, 1990).
Consistent with this recommendation (Klein & Kozlowski, 2000), our questions were worded using
the team as the appropriate referent (see Appendix). Next, to determine whether or not the data sample
exhibited cohesive group characteristics, we used two procedures (Table 3): between-group ANOVA
and rwg(j) (Demaree, James, & Wolf, 1984), an indicator of within-group agreement (Currall & Inkpen,
2002). For the ANOVA, 15 of the 22 study constructs indicate significant between-group differences
(p < 0.05). Insignificant ANOVA results, however, may indicate either insufficient variance across
groups or a lack of agreement within groups. Therefore, we also calculated the rwg(j) statistic, which
measures the level of agreement within a group (Table 3). All levels exceed the 0.70 standard, indicating that team-mates were consistent in their responses within the teams. This result indicates that the
lack of significance of some of the ANOVAs was due to a lack of variance across teams rather than a
lack of team agreement. The data were collected specifically to be analyzed at the team level and these
analyses supported the aggregation. The data were aggregated to the team level by taking the average
response for all team members.

Results
We ran a separate regression for each dependent variable in Figure 1(b). The sample size for all regressions was n ¼ 24. Ability, benevolence, and integrity from the same time period were included as independent variables for each of the four models predicting trust. This analysis was run as four separate
regressions, one for each time period. The time periods occurred approximately 10 days apart. A separate regression was run for the prediction of each of the three trustworthiness constructs. At T2, for
example, the development team’s reports of its formalizing and scoping actions were used to predict
the management team’s perceptions of the development team’s ability, benevolence, and integrity in
three separate models. For each model predicting an RTR, trust from the previous time period was
included as an independent variable. These regression models represent longitudinal models, with trust
from one time period predicting each RTR for the next time period, which occurred approximately 10
days later. Analyses for all T3 and T4 models included an additional independent construct. We
included the previous level of the dependent variable to control for pre-existing perceptions. As an
example, the model predicting trust at T3 includes the trust level at T1 as an independent construct.
The strengths of the relationships are listed in Table 4.

The prediction of trust
Hypothesis 1 predicts that the three trustworthiness factors will significantly predict trust in the counterpart team. For the development team’s trust in management (T1 and T3), integrity’s importance
increased from insignificance at T1 to being highly significant at T3. Benevolence was actually negatively related to trust at T1, but teams may have little basis for the perception this early in the project
(T1) (Mayer et al., 1995). Benevolence subsequently drops to insignificance at T3. For both teams’
trust perceptions, ability is a consistently strong predictor of trust. Both teams apparently became more
task-oriented as the project progressed, as evidenced by the relative importance of ability at T3 and T4
versus benevolence and integrity. Thus, nine out of the possible 12 predictors from the two teams’
perspectives across the four waves of data collection are significant in the hypothesized direction, providing support for Hypothesis 1. We also note that while previous levels of trust were added for the T3
and T4 analysis, controlling for previous perceptions apparently had little effect. Trust was insignificant at T3, and somewhat significant at T4.

The prediction of risk-taking behaviors
We tested the hypothesis that trust will increase risk-taking behaviors (H2) using data that were lagged
by one time period, or about 10 days. The analysis was conducted with trust from the previous time
period, because the level of trust a team has in its counterpart team at one wave of data collection

should affect its subsequent behavior in the period that follows. Thus, management team trust at T2
would affect its decisions to delegate and monitor in the time period from T2 to T3, reflected at the T3
data collection. The T3 and T4 analyses also included the appropriate construct to control for previous
levels (at T1 and T2 respectively) of the risk-taking action.

The results indicate that trust is a significant predictor for some risk-taking behaviors, but not for
others. Trust is not a significant predictor of formalizing (T1 and T3), but the formalizing control variable was significant at T3. In contrast, scoping was strongly related to trust at both T1 and T3, but the
scoping control variable at T3 was insignificant. In predicting management actions, trust was strongly
related to delegating, but not to monitoring. This result provides some evidence that some management
and development risk-taking behaviors were a function of their trust in the other team.

The prediction of reciprocal trust
Hypothesis 3 embodies the concept of reciprocal trust, since it predicts that one team’s actions will
affect the other team’s beliefs about the first team’s trustworthiness. To test this hypothesis, the relationships between Team A’s risk-taking behaviors and Team B’s perception of Team A’s ability, benevolence, and integrity perceptions were examined. For the T3 and T4 analyses, we again included
constructs (ability, benevolence, and integrity at T1 and T2, respectively) to control for previous perceptions of trustworthiness.
We tested whether developer risk-taking actions were related to management’s perceptions of development team trustworthiness at T2 and T4. Formalizing was strongly related to benevolence and integrity perceptions at T2. Developer efforts at scoping were negatively related to integrity at T2, but only
weakly related to integrity at T4. At T4, however, scoping was a significant predictor of ability and
benevolence. We note that for all the T4 analyses previous levels for the trustworthiness constructs
were all highly significant (p < 0.001), indicating that the previous levels of trustworthiness were
the primary predictors.
We also tested whether management’s actions (RTRs) were related to the development team’s perceptions of management team trustworthiness at T3. Delegation had a negative relationship with all
three trustworthiness perceptions (ability, benevolence, and integrity), but the relationship with ability
was especially strong. Monitoring had the strongest effect on benevolence, but had a strong negative
relationship with all three trustworthiness constructs. The variables controlling for previous actions
were again significant, but were not as strong as the developer results at T3. Previous levels of integrity
were marginally significant, perhaps indicating that integrity is driven more by management behaviors
(monitoring and delegating) than previous perceptions. These results indicate that the teams’ actions
were related to its counterpart’s beliefs about trustworthiness, and therefore support Hypothesis 3.1

Discussion
This study makes three primary contributions to research on trust. First, this research answers the call to
extend research on trust to the group level of analysis (Schoorman et al., 1996b). Interacting teams
are a fact of organizational life and, given the important role that trust can play in organizational
1
We conducted non-parametric Komolgorov–Smirnoff tests on all 45 variables in the study. None of the results was significant,
indicating that none of the distributions were significantly non-normal. Of the 45 variables under study, only management
benevolence at wave 4 had any significant outliers. We removed the two outliers from this variable and reran the associated
regressions. The regression coefficients remained relatively stable, although several of the significance levels declined somewhat.
Given that outliers were at issue in only 2 per cent of the study’s variables and that the magnitude of the effects on the regressions
involved was sporadic and modest, for consistency we opted to stay with the original data as reported by the teams without
exclusion of the outliers.

effectiveness, advances in the understanding of how trust can be built or eroded in the team environment should prove valuable to organizations and managers. This research proposes and finds support
for the assertion that trust at the team level will act similarly in terms of its antecedents and consequences to trust at the interpersonal level, thus extending the Mayer et al. (1995) model of trust to
the intergroup level of analysis. In addition, this research addresses the different ways that trust at
the group level of analysis could be measured, and approaches the issue consistent with past research
on groups that allowed individual respondents to assess their perceptions of the group’s beliefs.
Second, this research develops and tests several new measures of risk-taking behavior specific to
interacting project teams, facilitating future research in this domain. Although these measures were
studied using student teams, a condition that was necessary given the control we sought in this
research, we believe that these constructs may be applicable outside of the educational environment.
Both development and management team behaviors were shown to be related to trust. We also found
that these behaviors had implications for how they were perceived by their counterpart team. Contextually appropriate measures of risk-taking behaviors are apparently an important tool for understanding the ongoing development of trust in any environment. This research highlights this fact, and
provides four specific types of risk-taking behaviors that could be utilized in research in project management environments.
Finally, and most significantly, our results support our central proposition that changes in trust over
time may occur as part of a cyclical (or reciprocal) process. The behavioral consequences (risk-related
actions) of trust on the part of one team have consequences, since they appear to affect the second
team’s perceptions of the first team’s trustworthiness, and then subsequently the second team’s own
risk-related actions. This process continues for as long as the parties interact. Our tests for reciprocal
trust were largely successful. In T2, T3, and T4, risk-taking actions were significantly related to the
other team’s trustworthiness perceptions, which in turn affected trust and risk-taking behaviors. This
pattern of action and reaction held true as management and development teams interacted throughout
the duration of the project. Ultimately, no study can prove causality, and the current research is no
exception. We do note, however, that the pattern of relationships among the variables is quite consistent with the proposed model despite the small sample size.

Practical implications
The importance of context (e.g., the stage of development of the team) was evident throughout this
study. For the reciprocal trust results, for example, the development teams’ attempts to control project
scope at T2 were negatively related to integrity. At the same time, actions that formalized the process
were positively related to integrity and benevolence. Neither scoping nor formalizing was related to
ability. Management teams apparently interpreted early efforts by the development team to structure
the process as an indication that they cared about the management team and would complete the project as promised. At T4, however, formalizing actions were no longer related to trustworthiness, but
scoping actions were significantly related to all three trustworthiness dimensions. In contrast with T2,
the negative relationship with ability was especially strong. These results indicate that by the end of the
project developers’ attempts to reduce the size of the project may have been interpreted by management as excuses for a lack of competence. Thus, one team’s interpretation of the other team’s actions
appears to depend on when the actions occurred during the project’s evolution. These results underscore the previously discussed importance of tracking not only behaviors, as is common in game theory research, but also perceptions of the other party and trust.
In another example, we expected that delegation by the management team would signal a level
of trust in the developer team and would be positively received. Indeed, there was a strong positive

relationship between the management teams’ trust in the developer teams and management’s subsequent delegating behavior. The reaction of the development teams to the delegating was decidedly
negative on their perceptions of the management teams’ trustworthiness, however, suggesting that
delegation may have been interpreted by the developers as an abdication of responsibility on management’s part rather than a demonstration of trust (Leana, 1986; Schriesheim, Neider, & Scandura,
1998). It would appear that the management teams needed to more carefully communicate the intentions behind their actions to make clear that the delegation was driven by their trust in the developers.
Further research to tease out the effects of the context and communications between the teams on subsequent reactions is clearly needed.

Strengths, limitations, and conclusion
To increase the internal validity of this research we designed a study that had features of both laboratory
and field studies. Both designs have their relative advantages and disadvantages. Laboratory studies
provide good control, but tend to lack the longer-term relationships and also the salient risk to the parties that are both important to study trust effectively. Conversely, field settings provide these rich contextual factors, but tend to be open to alternative explanations due to the lack of control over extraneous
influences. The current research employed a controlled field study that enabled random assignment to
groups and control over many factors such as the difficulty of the projects and the time allowed for
project completion. At the same time, the study provided a task in which the teams were interdependent,
had something of value at stake (a grade), and interacted over a considerable period of time (6 weeks).
This research was conducted employing a student sample, which in many instances raises issues of
generalizability. Previous research has argued, for example, that college students have a weak definition
of self, have less established attitudes, and are more easily influenced (Sears, 1986). Two factors may
help reduce these generalizability concerns for our particular research. First, this research was conducted
with senior-level undergraduates who were familiar with the task domain (systems analysis and design),
who would be working in such an environment in the near future, and who had meaningful performance
metrics (grades) directly tied to their project performance. Second, the primary purpose of this research
was not to extrapolate our results to real project teams (where generalizability concerns might best be
categorized as those involving external validity), but rather to study the evolution of reciprocal trust
between teams, a phenomenon that we believe can reasonably be studied with student groups (Mook,
1983). Our sample size was also small (N ¼ 24), but not unusual for research involving teams. We encourage other studies to replicate our results with larger samples in different contexts.
The longitudinal nature of our study provides insights that would not be possible with either a crosssectional or a traditional laboratory design. Not only did this research demonstrate that one way trust
levels can change between teams (i.e., through an action–reaction cycle), but it also allowed us to
examine how time can serve as a contextual variable, where actions may be interpreted differently
depending on factors like the stage of a project. The number of significant relationships in our model
is particularly remarkable given the limited number of groups being observed (n ¼ 24 teams). Despite
support for our model of reciprocal trust, it should be noted that reciprocal trust is not the same as a
systematic evolution of trust, where trust continues to build or erode over time. Such systematic evolution may be influenced by a number of other factors in addition to reciprocal trust, such as changes in
the workplace or job structure, changes in personal needs, new information on trustees, and changes in
other relationships that influence the focus relationship. Thus, while reciprocity may be necessary for
the systematic evolution of trust, it does not guarantee it.
This study provides rare evidence of reciprocal trust—a phenomenon that is difficult to observe
given the complexities of gathering longitudinal observations in a reasonably controlled environment.

These results indicate that reciprocal trust warrants additional study. Future research should explore
how other contextual variables may influence trust formation between interacting parties. As an example, while we focus on the effects of actions driving trust, other factors—e.g., environmental factors—
might also be examined. In addition, studies which encompass group interaction characteristics—such
as the frequency and types of communications between members—may also be informative. Factors
such as power and status differences between the interacting parties may also play a significant role on
trust formation and change over time. Research on reciprocal trust may also benefit from complementary theories such as attribution theory—e.g., Ferrin and Dirks (2003) and Korsgaard, Brodt, and
Whitener (2002)—which may provide insights about how perceptions of trustworthiness are formed.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, the extension of an interpersonal model of trust to the domain of interteam trust creates new opportunities for multilevel research, an important step for gaining a full theoretical understanding of trust in the future.
