Much of the government intervention into the market ` gap’ for start-up and early-stage equity
® nance in the UK is based on the belief that the problem is on the supply side. Based on an
analysis of the informal venture capital market this paper argues that there is no shortage of
® nance available. A survey of business angels reveals that many are willing to allocate a higher
proportion of their investment portfolio to investments in unquoted companies, with recent tax
incentives having a positive eÚ ect on their willingness to invest. Over 90% are currently looking
to make more investments. However, there are constraints on their ability to invest: they do not
see enough deals that meet their investment criteria, the majority of the investment proposals
that they receive are of poor quality, and they are often unable to negotiate acceptable investment terms and conditions with entrepreneurs. The implication is that there is a need for further
interventions by policy-makers to remove these barriers so that more small ® rms can take
advantage of the substantial pool of angel ® nance that is available.

Introduction

In recent years there has been much debate in the UK, as well as elsewhere in the
European Union and beyond, about the availability of risk capital for businesses at
their seed, start-up and early growth stages. The popular view is that there is a lack of
what might be termed ` adventure’ capital because most investors are unwilling to
invest in new and recently started businesses, especially if they are in technology
sectors, because of perceived high risks and low returns. This view underpins the
thinking of policy-makers and is re¯ ected in a range of interventions to increase the
supply of early-stage capital, such as the Regional Venture Capital Funds initiative
(Department of Trade and Industry 1999), and tax incentives and support for business angel networks (services that ` introduce’ entrepreneurs to potential investors) to
expand the pool of business angels. However, based just on a consideration of
the angel market place ± which represents the biggest single source of ® nance for

businesses at their seed, start-up and early-growth stages (Mason and Harrison 2000a)
± the supposition that the cause of the ` equity gap’ is on the supply side is contradicted
both by empirical evidence (Mason and Harrison 1994, 1999, Van Osnabrugge and
Robinson 2000) and by the views of informed participants in the marketplace. For
example, David Grahame, Managing Director of LINC Scotland, a business angel
network, has observed that ` there are . . . companies out there saying that they cannot
® nd money, and our angels are saying that they can only place 10% of what they want
to invest’ (Nicholson 2000).
This paper addresses this debate. It focuses on business angels ± that is, high net
worth individuals (mostly self-made) who invest their own money in unlisted businesses. Business angels have become recognized as the main investors in entrepreneurial companies at their seed, start-up and early growth stages. An analysis of business
angel networks in the UK in 1999± 2000 indicates that 75% of investments by business
angels involved amounts of £100 000 or less, 59% of their investments were at the
seed, start-up and early stages, with a further 33% at the expansion stage, and that
they make investments across a wide range of industries, including technology ventures that accounted for 45% of the total (Mason 2001).
Our starting point is to suggest that there is no shortage of ® nance that is available,
or potentially available, from business angels. In the UK it has been estimated that
there are between 20 000 and 40 000 business angels who invest between £0.5 bn and
£1 bn per annum in around 3000± 6000 businesses (Mason and Harrison 2000a). As
noted above, more than half of these investments are in businesses at their seed, startup and early stages of growth. To put this into perspective, venture capital funds
invested in 1182 businesses in the year 2000, of which only 409 (35%) were seed, startup or early stage (British Venture Capital Association [BVCA] 2001).2 Moreover, the
supply of ® nance from business angels could be signi® cantly expanded. First, most
active business angels are unable to invest as frequently as they would wish because of
a lack of suitable investment opportunities (Mason and Harrison 1994, 1999, Van
Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). Wetzel (1986, 1987) interprets this as a sign of
market ineÝ ciency. Second, tax incentives would prompt active investors to seriously
consider allocating more of their investment portfolio to the unquoted companies
sector (Mason and Harrison 1999, 2000b). Third, the proportion of the self-made,
high net worth population who are active business angels could be substantially
increased with appropriate forms of support (Mason and Harrison 1993). For example, in the USA potential investors outnumber actual investors by a ratio of 3:1
(Freear et al. 1994). In short, there is a substantial pool of informal venture capital
available for investment; however, it is not being mobilized eÚ ectively. The challenge
for policy-makers is therefore to understand the barriers that prevent this capital from
being invested, and to design appropriate interventions for their alleviation or
removal.
Wetzel (1986, 1987) has argued that the inability of business angels to make as
many investments as they would like is an information problem that arises from the
largely invisible nature of the participants in the informal venture capital market,
which impedes the ¯ ow of ® nance from investor to entrepreneur. The eÚ ect is that
investors looking for investment opportunities and entrepreneurs seeking investors
both experience high search costs. This, in turn, creates a discouragement eÚ ect,
analogous to the discouragement eÚ ect in labour markets, amongst both suppliers
of and seekers for capital, encouraging them to drop out of the market. However,
with public intervention in the market to support the development business angel

networks, which provide channels of communication through which information
about opportunities for investment can be transmitted between entrepreneur and
investor, this can no longer be regarded as a complete explanation. Over the past
10 years or so signi® cant numbers of business angel networks (BANs) have been
formed in the UK and also in various other countries. However, for a signi® cant
proportion of UK investors, membership of one or more BAN has had little or no
impact on increasing the volume of potentially investable opportunities that they
receive (Mason and Harrison 1999).
Thus, there is a need to consider a wider range of factors that on the one hand
prevent business angels from investing as frequently as they would wish and, on the
other hand, prevent more entrepreneurs from accessing the substantial pool of ® nance
that business angels have available to invest. The aim of this paper is therefore to take
a broader perspective on the barriers that business angels encounter in investing. First,
we identify the size of the pool of uncommitted business angel ® nance. Second, we
identify the key barriers which impede the ¯ ow of this ® nance to new and early stage
ventures. Finally, we summarize some of the implications for the development of
public policy.

2.

Methodology

The inherent diÝ culties involved in identifying samples of business angels are well
understood . Business angels are an invisible population who are not listed in any
directories and there are no public records of their transactions. Most studies therefore, of necessity, are based either on snowball survey techniques or use samples of
convenience. Moreover, the strong desire of most business angels for anonymity
(Benjamin and Margulis 2000) and the private and sensitive nature of the subject
matter (Haar et al. 1988) generally results in low response rates to postal questionnaire
surveys and requests for interviews. Thus, any sampling approach has multiple sources
of potential bias. However, as the size and characteristics of the population are
unknown and probably unknowable (Wetzel 1983), it is not possible to assess the
extent of bias in any individual sample.
The paper is based on a postal survey of investors registered with the National
Business Angels Network (NBAN).3 NBAN was formed in 1999 on the initiative of
the Department of Trade and Industry and is built upon a number of pre-existing
local and regional business angel networks with the intention of signi® cantly enhancing and increasing the ¯ ow of investment opportunities to investors. Other aspects of
its remit are to help raise awareness of the role of business angel ® nance and encourage
more investment into growth businesses. NBAN is structured as a federation of independent local/regional and national business angel networks ± termed special associates ± who ` pool’ information on their investment opportunities so that they are
available to all investors across the system. This is achieved by means of the following
services: (1) a ` BestMatch’ service, a web site containing searchable business opportunities; (2) a monthly Bulletin, listing new business opportunities; and (3) regular
presentations by businesses to investors at locally held meetings. NBAN currently
(April 2001) has 26 special associates.4 These comprise both commercially-oriented
networks run by private sector organizations and also networks run either by, or on
behalf of, public sector and other not-for-pro® t organizations engaged in business
development or regional development. In addition to Department of Trade and

<-----Page 3----->274

COLIN MASON AND RICHARD HARRISON

Industry (DTI) support, NBAN receives sponsorship from several private sector companies, mostly in the ® nancial sector.
Business angels who are registered with networks clearly come under the category of
a sample of convenience. The attraction of such investors for researchers is that by
joining a business angel network they have shed their cloak of invisibility. Although
their names and addresses are not made public, some networks have been willing to
distribute questionnaires to their clients on behalf of researchers on the grounds that
improved information on the market will enable them to improve their service.5
However, it remains unclear whether business angels who join business angel networks
are in any way distinctive. We have argued elsewhere that any risk of bias is greatest if
a sample is drawn from a single business angel network (Mason and Harrison 1997).
The important characteristic of NBAN’ s investor database is that it includes the clients
of a number of business angel networks throughout England and Wales. We anticipate
that this will have the eÚ ect of reducing any bias.6
A total of 84 responses were received by the deadline for their return. This represents a 20% response rate. As other commentators have noted (Haar et al. 1988,
Benjamin and Margulis 2000), business angels seek to safeguard their privacy and
so are likely to be reluctant to respond to questionnaires, even anonymously . In these
circumstances, the response rate is quite acceptable, particularly when the length of
the questionnair e is taken into account (12 pages, 46 questions).7 The majority of
investors registered with NBAN are private individuals ± i.e. business angels ± and
others representing business angel syndicates. However, some professional intermediaries (e.g. accountants) , non-® nancial corporations engaged in corporate venturing
and venture capital funds are also registered with NBAN. Just under 90% of responses
were from business angels. This paper is based only on the responses of business angels
(n= 74). Amongst the business angel respondents, 91% were male and 9% were
female. This represents a much higher proportion of women than in previous surveys
of business angels where the male response was typically 99%. The regional distribution of business angel respondents was weighted towards the south of England
(table 1).

3.1

Investmen t potential
Income and net worth

Most business angels have a high net worth and signi® cant income. Just under threequarters (71%) of respondents to our survey have a net worth (excluding principal
residence) in excess of £500 000, with millionaires comprising 62% of all respondents.
In terms of income, 12% had £250 000 or more, 43% were in the £100 000± £249 000
range with a further 39% in the £50 000± £99 000 range. However, whereas wealth is
a necessary condition for someone to become a business angel, in most cases it is not
suÝ cient. The source of wealth is also signi® cant. Business angels are much more likely
to have achieved their wealthy status through their own eÚ orts, as opposed to having
inherited it (i.e. ® rst generation money) and, in particular, have achieved their wealth
through entrepreneurial activity rather than in a high income occupation.8 This is
re¯ ected in this study: 71% of our respondents had founded one or more businesses; on
average the respondents had started two businesses and 9% of respondents had
founded ® ve or more businesses. Thus, as previous research has suggested, one of
the very few sustainable generalizations that can be made about business angels,
who in most other respects are a very heterogeneous population, is that they are
typically successful cashed-out entrepreneurs.

3.2

Motives for investing

Business angels invest in unlisted companies predominantly for ® nancial reasons (table
2). By far the most important reason is ` the potential for high capital appreciation’ ,
with current/future income ranked third. However, con® rming previous research,
non-® nancial motives emerge as a very strong secondary consideration for becoming
a business angel. Indeed, ` personal satisfaction from being involved with entrepreneurial businesses’ is the second most important reason for investing. Another signi® cant non-® nancial reason for investing in unlisted companies is ` a way of having fun
with my money’ . For most of these business angels there is no trade-oÚ between

® nancial and non-® nancial motives: it is a both/and rather than an either/or choice.
Signi® cant secondary considerations for investing include ` to make use of tax breaks’
and ` the desire to support the next generation of entrepreneurs’ . However, in other
respects business angels are not motivated by altruistic concerns, with 85% stating
that the support of socially useful products and services is not a reason for investing. As
other research has suggested (Barker 1999), most business angels regard their investment activity as totally separate from their philanthropic activities. Finally, most
business angels do not invest to receive personal recognition in the community:
respondents were almost unanimous in stating that this is not a consideration.
Business angel investment is, therefore, primarily an economic phenomenon , undertaken by investors in the expectation of signi® cant returns. However, the secondary
importance of a desire for involvement in the entrepreneurial process emphasizes that
business angel investors bring more than money to the deal, and seek to contribute
their experience and knowledge to their investments. Indeed, 94% of respondents
describe themselves as hands-on investors who bring a wide range of experience in
terms of functional expertise, length of senior management or professional experience
and industry knowledge to their investee businesses.

3.3

Investment activity: actual and potential

Of the 74 business angels who responded, 52 (70%) had made investments in the 3
years prior to the survey. These investors had collectively invested £12.25 million in
118 businesses.9 Assuming that the investor characteristics of the sample are representative, this translates into an estimate of around £60 million invested in over 600
businesses by NBAN investors in the 3 years prior to the survey. For most business
angels these investments represented only a relatively small proportion of their investment portfolio, typically between 5 and 10%. The remainder of their portfolio is
invested in the stock market (93% of investors), property (62%) and banks/building
societies (57%) and, to a lesser extent, bonds (49%) and gilts (36%). Relatively few
business angels invest in art/antiques, collectibles or other more esoteric categories
(table 3), con® rming that they are ` investment’ rather than ` consumption’ investors.

However, many business angels are prepared to allocate a higher proportion of their
investment portfolio to investments in unlisted companies (median= 20%) (table 4).
The factors that in¯ uence the proportion of their portfolio that business angels
invest in unlisted companies appears to be largely determined by personal rather
than environmental considerations. As table 5 shows, the tax regime and, to a lesser
extent, economic growth are the only economic factors that have a signi® cant in¯ uence on how most business angels make their investment portfolio allocation decision

and speci® cally on the proportion of their portfolio that is invested in unlisted businesses. Higher rates of capital gains tax and higher tax on dividend incomes would
each discourage half of the respondents from investing in unlisted companies.
Conversely, reducing the rate of capital gains tax would encourage 52% of investors
to invest more (26% would be encouraged ` a lot’ ) while reducing tax on dividends
would encourage 43% of investors to invest more in unlisted companies. A total of
74% of business angels would be encouraged to invest more (43% ` a lot more’ ) by
front-end tax reliefs. This emphasis on tax is consistent with the earlier evidence on
motives for investing, which noted that making use of tax breaks is an important
reason for making investments. Indeed, 38% of the investments made by respondents
used the Enterprise Investment Scheme.10 It also suggests that the recent introduction
of a capital gains tax taper ± which reduces the rate of capital gains tax for higher rate
taxpayers to just 10% after an asset has been held for 2 years ± should have the eÚ ect
of increasing the amount of ® nance that business angels are willing to invest in unlisted
companies. In contrast, more than half of all respondents are not in¯ uenced by
interest rates, stock market trends or the rate of in¯ ation, and less than one-quarter
of investors are in¯ uenced by property prices.

3.4

Time constraints

The process of investing involves considerable time: there is a need to identify potential investment opportunities; once identi® ed, the process of assessing, structuring and
negotiating the investment can be lengthy; and having invested, most business angels
then devote signi® cant amounts of time to supporting their investee businesses.
Respondents to this survey work an average of 6 days per month in each of their
portfolio companies. Moreover, for most business angels, investing is a part-time
activity. Thus, while business angels may have additional capital available, they
may not have suÝ cient time to add to their existing portfolio of investments in
unquoted companies. Indeed, previous studies have con® rmed that the lack of time
to search for and evaluate investment opportunities are signi® cant barriers to investment (Mason and Harrison 1999). In this survey more than one-half (57%) of the
respondents con® rmed that there is an upper limit to the number of investments in
their portfolio that they are capable of managing eÚ ectively. The average maximum
portfolio size is ® ve investments but one in ten investors gave a limit of more than 10
investments. The key constraints are, ® rst, insuÝ cient time to monitor the performance of additional investments (45%) and, second, the time available to play a
hands-on role (45%). However, the vast majority of business angels in this survey
reported that they have not reached the limit of their investment capacity.

3.5

Summary

This section has established that business angels do have potential untapped capital
that is available for investment in unquoted companies. They are willing to allocate a
higher proportion of their investment portfolios to such investments and have the time
available to search for and manage additional investments. Recent changes to the tax
regime ± some of which were announced after the survey was undertaken ± seem likely
to reinforce their willingness to increase their investments in unquoted companies.

Indeed, more than 90% of respondents are currently looking to make further investments. The amounts that they have available to invest range from around £10 000 to
over £1 million, with an average of £100 000 (table 6) and in aggregate terms is very
signi® cant, exceeding the amount that they have collectively invested in the 3 years
prior to the survey. Extrapolating from this sample to the population of angel investors
registered with NBAN, this suggests that NBAN members have around £70 million
available for investment. If business angels are unable to invest this money in unlisted
companies it will be redirected predominantly to the Stock Market, banks and building societies and property. The remainder of this paper therefore considers whether
business angels encounter barriers to investing in unlisted companies and, if so, what
form they take and how they might be overcome.

4.

Barriers to investment

A useful way in which to structure this discussion of potential barriers to investment
for business angels is in terms of the three key stages in the investment decision-making
process: screening, evaluation and negotiation (Mason and Rogers 1997, Feeney et al.
1999). The ® rst aspect is the business angel’ s investment criteria. The ® rst reaction of
business angels when screening an investment opportunity is to consider the extent of
the ` ® t’ with their own personal investment criteria (Mason and Rogers 1997). Having
established that an opportunity satis® es their personal investment criteria angels then
go on to evaluate its intrinsic merits. The ® nal stage in the investment process is the
negotiation over the terms and conditions of the investment.

4.1

Investment criteria

Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents have clearly de® ned investment criteria
which in¯ uence the types of businesses that they will consider investing in. These
criteria include stage of business development, industry, technology and location.
The business angels in this study are primarily interested in investing in established
companies seeking expansion ® nancing, early stage expansion and to a much lesser
extent start-up ® nancing. Only a small minority of business angels are interested in
investing at the seed stage. A signi® cant proportion are also interested in investing in
management buyouts and buy-ins (table 7).

Most of the survey respondents also impose restrictions on the industries that they
will invest in. In response to an open question on industries that they were particularly
interested in investing in, or would not consider investing in, positive responses outnumbered negative responses. This challenges the conventional wisdom that business
angels are better able to articulate what they would not invest in, rather than what
they would consider investing in. The industry preferences were generally articulated
in very precise terms rather than in terms of broad industry sectors. Moreover, the
preferences were extremely varied. For example, for every investor who stated an
interest in investing in traditional manufacturing or engineering businesses there
was another who would not consider investing in these sectors. Similarly, some angels
are averse to investing in technology sectors whereas others take the opposite view.
More than 4 out of 10 investors expressed a strong or very strong interest in internet,
IT and telecoms businesses; interest in multimedia and biotechnology was less strong
(table 8). These industry preferences re¯ ect the fact that business angels generally
invest in sectors, markets or technologies where they have some degree of familiarity or
direct experience (Kelly and Hay 1996). More than 6 out of 10 investors say that their
ability to invest is limited by their lack of knowledge of particular industries, technologies and markets. Indeed, business angels reject an average of 80% of the investment
proposals that they receive for this reason.
Over one-half (55%) of all business angels also have a geographical limit beyond
which they will not consider investing. For the majority of these investors (67%) the

limit is 2 hours travelling time. Moreover, very few investors are interested in investing
in continental Europe (10%) or North America (4%).
However, we know from anecdotal evidence that business angels’ investment preferences are not necessarily a good guide to their actual investments. Indeed, most of the
business angels in this study indicated that they will consider relaxing their investment
criteria in certain circumstances, notably where the entrepreneur/management team
has high credibility (table 9), con® rming other evidence that angels place much greater
weight on the ` jockey’ than on the ` horse’ (Fiet 1995a, b, Van Osnabrugge and
Robinson 2000, Harrison and Mason 2002). Investors will also be more likely to invest
if the referral is recommended by a trusted source (Harrison et al. 1997). Other factors
that encourage some investors to relax their investment criteria are the location of
the business close to the investor’ s home ± which has the eÚ ect of reducing transaction
and monitoring costs ± and a small deal size ± which may encourage a speculative
investment.

4.2

Quality of investment opportunities

The quality of deal ¯ ow that business angels see is a further signi® cant barrier to
investment. In this survey, 81% of respondents indicated that their ability to invest is
limited by the quality of the opportunities that they see. According to the angels
themselves, the main de® ciencies in the proposals that they see are business plans
which contain unrealistic assumptions or information that is not credible and, second,
the entrepreneur/management team lacks credibility. Signi® cant, although less frequently cited, weaknesses include insuÝ cient information provided, business concept
requires further development and limited growth prospects of the business (table 10).
This is consistent with the few other studies to have examined the investment decisionmaking process of business angels (Mason and Harrison 1996a, Mason and Rogers
1997, Feeney et al. 1999).
The deal ¯ ow that business angels receive comes from a variety of formal and
informal sources. For this group of investors ± all registered with NBAN ± it is not

surprising that NBAN is the most common source of information on investment
opportunities, with other business angel networks (presumably networks that are
local associates of NBAN) also ® guring prominently (table 11). However, the other
signi® cant sources of deal ¯ ow are informal ± business associates, friends, media and
personal search. By contrast, relatively few business angels obtain information on
investment opportunities from formal sources such as accountants, lawyers, venture
capital funds, banks, and stockbrokers . This re¯ ects the ad hoc, unscienti® c way in
which business angels search for investment opportunities (Wetzel 1981, Mason and
Harrison 1994). Informal sources (friends, business associates, other business angels)
also attracted the greatest support as the referral sources that provide the best quality
of investment opportunities, con® rming earlier US ® ndings (Freear et al. 1992).

Based on responses from 34 investors who had failed to agree terms and condition s with an entrepreneur on at least one
occasio n in the previous 3 years.

4.3

Failure to negotiate

A ® nal reason why business angels do not invest as frequently as they would like is that
they fail to negotiate a deal with the entrepreneur that is acceptable to both sides. This
occurs surprisingly often. Indeed, a previous study noted that business angels made
four times as many oÚ ers to invest as were accepted (Mason and Harrison 1996b). In
this survey 53% of respondents indicated that there had been occasions in the 3 years
prior to the survey ± in most cases just one or two ± when they had wanted to invest
but had failed to agree on the terms and conditions of the investment. By far the main
reasons why the investment was not made was because the angel and entrepreneur
could not agree on either the price or the shareholding structure (table 12). This may
re¯ ect unrealistic expectations on the part of one or other, or both, parties.

5.

Conclusions

The study underlines the signi® cance of the informal venture capital market as a
source of ® nance for unlisted companies. Business angels registered with NBAN
have made an estimated 600 + investments involving an investment of some £60
million in the 3 years prior to the survey. As most business angels do not register
with business angel networks this scale of investment activity represents just the tip of
the iceberg. Furthermore, their investment potential is enormous: business angels
registered with NBAN have an estimated £70 million available for investment in
unlisted companies and the average business angel is willing to double the proportion
of his/her investment portfolio that is currently allocated to unlisted companies. The
government can take some of the credit for helping to create this pool of ® nance.
Business angels are highly sensitive to the tax regime, and the willingness of active
investors to increase the proportion of their investment portfolio that they allocate to
investments in unlisted companies can be attributed, in part, to the eÚ ect of tax
incentives such as the Enterprise Allowance Scheme and the Capital Gains Tax
taper. These initiatives may also be expected to have encouraged other high net
worth self-made individuals to become business angels.
However, there are signi® cant constraints on the ability of business angels to invest
as frequently as they would wish, or as much as they would wish:11

<-----Page 13----->284

COLIN MASON AND RICHARD HARRISON

. business angels do not see enough businesses that meet their investment criteria, and their ability to relax these investment criteria is limited by their
reluctance to invest in unfamiliar industries and markets;
. the majority of the investment proposals that they see are of poor quality;
. to a lesser extent, they fail to negotiate acceptable terms and conditions with
entrepreneurs.
The clear implication of this study is that the eÚ ectiveness of current government
interventions in the informal venture capital market to increase the amount of equity
capital that is channelled to new and growing businesses ± involving the provision of
tax incentives and contributing to the operating costs of business angel networks ± will
be limited because of the existence of various barriers that prevent business angels
from investing as often as they would like to. This evidence therefore suggests that the
time has come to fundamentally redesign the concept of business angel networks. As
originally conceived, business angel networks were based on a diagnosis of information
ineÝ ciencies in this capital market. As a result, they have been established to provide
a channel of communication between investors and entrepreneurs in order to minimize the cost of the entrepreneur’ s search for capital, and enabling investors to examine investment opportunities that meet their screening criteria, without compromising
their anonymity. Business angel networks have been judged to be a success, both in
terms of their direct impacts (promotion of investment opportunities, mobilization of
capital, investment activity), induced investment eÚ ects (leveraged bank lending),
indirect eÚ ects (advice and signposting, feedback) and cost-per-job (Harrison and
Mason 1996, but see Blatt and Riding 1996, for a dissenting view). However, conventional BANs will not cause reluctant potential investors to enter the market, nor
will they cause the owners of ` lifestyle’ ® rms to attempt to expand their businesses by
using external equity capital. Neither are they able to exert much quality control over
either their investor or business clients. Furthermore, they withdraw from the process
as soon as the introduction is made, and so play no role in the pricing and structuring
of any deal, which are signi® cant ` deal breakers’ (Freear et al. 1994). The clear
implication is therefore that there is a need to develop ` second generation’ BANs
whose role is much wider than simply being an information broker, supplying summary information on investment opportunities to business angels. The focus of such
BANs should be on educating the market place.12
Many business angels have fairly narrow investment criteria which they will only
relax in certain circumstances. Thus, the probability that a particular opportunity will
be of interest to any single angel is fairly low. This underlines the importance of
achieving critical mass in terms of investors and investment opportunities.
Accordingly, BANs must become much more proactive in their marketing eÚ orts.
In addition, they must also seek ways in which they can broaden the investment
criteria of investors, for example, by developing educational activities13 and encourage
the formation of investor syndicates. The feasibility of providing independent technology due diligence services should also be revisited (Freear et al. 1996, Mason and
Harrison 1998). More generally, BANs need to raise the knowledge and competence
of both entrepreneurs and business angels and also the small business ` support network’ ± accountants, lawyers, banks, consultants and advisers, etc. ± by developing
educational materials and running workshops and seminars. There are three speci® c
priorities. First, BANs must seek to educate entrepreneurs on the advantage s of equity
® nancing, in order to convert the need for equity ® nance into demand.14 Second,

<-----Page 14----->BARRIERS TO INVESTMENT IN THE INFORMAL VENTURE CAPITAL SECTOR

BANs need to ensure businesses are ` investor ready’ when they are promoted to
investors and business angels. This involves helping entrepreneurs to understand the
expectations and requirements of investors and how to make their business plans into
attractive investment opportunities (Mason and Harrison 2001). Previous studies have
highlighted problems associated with incomplete information in business plans
(Mason and Rogers 1997) and presentational de® ciencies (Mason and Harrison
2000c). Third, bearing in mind that business angels are a heterogeneous population
with diÚ ering levels of familiarity with techniques of investing, ranging from successful
cashed-out serial entrepreneurs on the one hand to inexperienced and ` virgin’ investors on the other, there is a need for BANs to help the latter group to raise their
competence in all aspects of ` doing the deal’ ± how to ® nd, evaluate, price, structure,
monitor, add value and exit from venture deals. However, rede® ning the role of BANs
in this way raises obvious questions of resourcing. To become more proactive and to
engage in a wider range of investor and entrepreneur education will require substantial additional funding and it will not be possible to recoup the additional costs
through registration fees and success fees. The rationale for government and other
sponsors to provide additional funding, as always, is that ` a thriving informal venture
capital market is a pre-requisite for a vigorous enterprise economy’ (Advisory Council
on Science and Technonogy [ACOST] 1990: 41). This receives con® rmation in the
Global Enterprise Monitor [GEM] 2001 study, which reports that ` the prevalence of
informal investors has a statistically signi® cant positive association with the overall
level of entrepreneurial activity and a stronger relationship with the level of opportunity entrepreneurship’ . In other words, in countries where the population is investing more personal funds, the level of opportunity-drive n entrepreneurial activity is
signi® cantly higher (Reynolds et al. 2001: 22).
In examining the role of the informal venture capital market in the funding of
ventures at their seed, start-up and early growth stages, it is no longer suÝ cient to
de® ne the problem as a lack of available capital: business angels have signi® cant funds
available and are prepared to invest more. Nor is it a matter of the mobilization of the
capital that is available, which intermediation initiatives such as BANs address, as a
signi® cant proportion of investors report receiving poor quality (non-investable) business opportunities being presented to them from this source. Rather, the issue is
fundamentally one of competence: many investors lack familiarity with techniques
of successful investing, the opportunities which come forward more often than not are
not ` investment ready’ , and the bottom level service providers in the small business
support network lack the expertise needed to add value to the process.

1. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 21st Babson College-KauÚ man Foundation
Entrepreneurship Research Conference at JoÈ nkoÈ ping International Business School, JoÈ nkoÈ ping,
Sweden, June 2001.
2. Moreover, this was an exceptional and wholly untypical year. In 1999, venture capital funds made 260
early-stage investments (23% of the total) and in 1998 made 241 such investments (21%) (BVCA
2001).
3. It should be noted that ` national’ in this context means England and Wales. LINC Scotland, which is
not a member of NBAN, provides business angel network services for Scotland.
4. One of these special associates, Equity Link, comprises a network of 12 local BANs in southern England.
5. This study, which was commissioned by the National Business Angel Network, is in this category.
6. It is acknowledged that business angels who are members of a business angel network may not be fully
representative of the business angel population as a whole. For example, it can be hypothesized that
such business angels may be biased towards those with poorer personal networks (and therefore have a

more critical need for networking), smaller amounts to invest and remoter locations. However, it is
impossible to empirically test for the existence of any biases because of the diÝ culties in identifying
business angels (Wetzel 1981, Mason and Harrison 1994). Moreover, previous studies of angels who are
members of BANs does not support this stereotype (Mason and Harrison 1999).
It was not possible to test for non-response bias because for reasons of con® dentiality we were not
provided with any personal information that NBAN holds on its registered investors.
In this respect, respondents diÚ er from the recently identi® ed so-called ` mass aÞ uent’ class in the UK ±
these are similar in income and net wealth terms, but this has been mostly acquired from employment,
notably in the ® nancial services sector, and they have limited exposure to entrepreneurial activity of any
sort (also see Anderson 1998).
Just under one-quarter (24%) of these investments were identi® ed through information provided by
NBAN.
This scheme provides private investors making investments in qualifying unquoted companies with
income tax relief on the amount invested, any investment gains are exempt from capital gains tax
and any losses from the investment can be set against future income tax liabilities and it provides the
ability to roll-over tax on capital gains arising from the disposal of other assets (Inland Revenue 2000).
In view of the geographically fragmented nature of the informal venture capital market it is quite
possible that there are regional variations in the strength of these impediments to investing.
However, it has not been possible to explore this issue with the available data. This is a fruitful avenue
of enquiry for future research.
Lange et al. (2002) highlight an additional pressure on BANs that is prompting such a change in focus.
They argue that the impact of the internet is making it harder and harder for BANs to charge for their
basic matchmaking services because it has become easier for entrepreneurs to ® nd sources of ® nance
without their help. This is putting pressure on BANs to add value to their services. They expect that
BANs will respond by evolving from pure intermediation services to become a one stop resourcing
service where ® nance is just one piece of a very complex package that also includes team building,
management recruitment, advisory boards, directors, etc.
A good example is CONNECT, which was initially developed in San Diego but has since been cloned in
several other localities around the world, including Scotland and Sweden. Its objective is to support the
creation, development and growth of technology-based enterprises. It does this in a variety of ways,
including a programme of seminars, brie® ngs, workshops and forums designed to develop the knowledge
and expertise of the investment community, advisers and policy-makers. One of the elements in this
programme is a ` Technology brie® ng’ .
The extent of equity aversion is underlined by the following statistic: four out of every ® ve small ® rms
that are referred by banks to LINC Scotland to raise equity ® nance from business angels refuse to go
(Grahame, 18 April 2001).
