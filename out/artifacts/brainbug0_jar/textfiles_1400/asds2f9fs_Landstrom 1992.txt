Many small firms in Sweden are characterized by a lack of equity capital. For several years
measures to increase the equity capital have been discussed. In this discussion the private
investors' market has received virtually no attention. This study presents some preliminary
results of the private investors in Sweden.
T h e research in small firms financing is characterized by a lack of theoretical framework. One
basic assumption in the study is that agency theory can provide an essential framework to
explain the interaction between the private investor and entrepreneur. Twenty-five hypotheses
generated from agency theory are formulated and tested on 62 small unlisted firms in Sweden.
Multiple regression analysis is used for the causal analyses.
The empirical results in the study show inter alia that the geographic distance and the private
investor's knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process seem to be the most
influential factors for determining the private investor's involvement in the portfolio firms. It is
also interesting to notice that none of the variables, frequency of contacts and the private
investor's operational work in the portfolio firm affect the performance of the firm. Contrary to
conventional wisdom, private investors do not add value to their portfolio firms through their
interaction with the entrepreneurs.
The theoretical conclusion is that agency theory does not provide any satisfactory framework
to explain the private investor - entrepreneur relationship. Some of the basic assumptions in
agency theory seem to be invalid. A model for the relationship between private investors and
entrepreneurs is developed in which four interaction strategies are identified. The model gives
implications on two levels: the portfolio level and the individual case level.

Introduction
Background

Seed capital for new firms is important to the commercialization of business innovations.
I n Sweden, few entrepreneurs have the personal resources necessary to finance earlystage firms. T h e problems experienced by small firms i n gaining access to equity
financing reflect both d e m a n d a n d supply factors. O n the d e m a n d side entrepreneurs d o
not appreciate the advantage of external equity financing because of the perceived loss of
independence, control a n d freedom of action. I n the early stages of a small firm's growth,
equity financing tends to be avoided because the price received per share is too low in the
eyes of the entrepreneur, and/or because the terms of the financing a n d the restrictions
placed o n managerial actions that outside investors justifiably d e m a n d a r e too onerous to
the entrepreneur (Day et al. 1985).
However, for entrepreneurs seeking external equity financing, the supply is limited.
Equity investment in small firms in unattractive to investors because the risks a r e not
commensurate with the potential returns. Small firms have a high failure rate a n d their
growth potential is highly uncertain. Small investments also create severe management

in equity financing sources for small firms, for example the development of the formal
venture capital industry in Sweden (Landstrom 1990:3), have failed to
close this equity capital gap. As a consequence, many small firms are undercapitalized.
This is particularly true for firms in the early stages of their development and in
technology-based firms.
In Sweden, measures to increase the equity capital in small unlisted firms have been
discussed for several years. In this discussion the private investors' market has received
virtually no attention. This paper presents some preliminary results of a study of private
investors in Sweden.

1 . 2 Private investors
In this study a relatively broad definition of private investors is used. The definition
includes external private individuals who provide risk capital (equity and near-equity
capital) direct to small unlisted firms. The private investors can be categorized in the
following way:
individuals in the firm's business environment (e.g. consultants, CEOs in other
firms, technical experts, etc.), who make few investments and invest small
amounts of capital per deal;
private individuals with no prior relationship to the firm who invest small amounts
of capital per deal;
informal risk capitalists ('business angels') who invest larger amounts of capital per
deal, but who make relatively few investments;
professional private investors who more frequently invest in small unlisted firms,
and who invest large amounts of capital per deal.
The categorization and definitions are not complete, but give the reader an understanding of the concept 'private investor'.
Some comments can be made regarding the definition. The definition of private
investors is broader than the definition of informal investors used in studies in the USA
(Wetzel 1981, Gaston 1989) and the UK (Mason and Harrison 1990). The broader
definition used in this study is interesting because the different categories of private
investors can be expected to have different investment behaviour, to provide different
resources to the firm, etc. Thus, the different categories of private investors can in
various ways be valuable to the firm.
T h e private investors in the first two categories given above provide only a small
amount of capital. Studies of young technology-based firms show that it is common to tie
up external expertise through small equity capital shares in the firm. Also, it is not
uncommon for young technology-based firms to attract quite a number of private
individuals who each invest small amounts of capital in the firm. O n the other hand,
informal risk capitalists seem to be rather unusual in Sweden. The definition also
includes more professional private investors. It is not uncommon in Sweden for
professional private investors to establish a company around their investments, due to tax
and risk reasons.

Agency theory

The research in s m d firms financing can be characterized by a lack of theoretical
framework. There are a lot of empirically based studies, but very few studies that try to
put the results of a broader theoretical framework. Therefore, it is important to find
theories which are valid in the small firms situation. One theory in this respect can be
agency theory. A basic assumption in this study is that agency theory in an essential way
can contribute to explaining the interaction between the private investor and the entrepreneur. In this section the general assumptions in agency theory will be presented,
agency theory's usefulness in small firms studies will be discussed, and, finally, external
investors' possibilities to monitor the entrepreneur's behaviour will be described.

2.1

General assumptions

In general, agency theory is directed to the problem that occurs when co-operating
parties have different goals and division of labour. Specifically, agency theory focuses on
the relationship in which one or more persons (the principal[s]) engage another person
(the agent) to perform some work on their behalf Uensen and Meckling 1976). The basic
premiss of agency theory is that both principals and agents are assumed to be rational
economic-maximizing individuals. Therefore, the separation of ownership and control
will result in decisions by the agent which are not always in the principals' best interests
and there will arise costs (agency costs) of bringing the agent's behaviour into line. These
agency costs include:
monitoring costs, i.e., costs incurred by the principals in monitoring and controlling behaviour;
bonding costs, i.e., cost:s incurred by the agent in demonstrating compliance with
the wishes of the principal;
residual loss, i.e., loss resulting from the divergence between the decisions made by
the agent and those which would maximize returns to the principal.
The unit of analysis in agency theory is the contract between the principal and agent.
These contracts (written and unwritten) specify the rights of the agent, performance
criteria on which agents are evaluated, and the payoff functions they face (Fama and
Jensen 1983). The theory tries to determine the most efficient contract governing the
principal-agent relationship. In particular, there are two agency problems that the
theory tries to solve. The first is the problem that arises when the goals of the principal
and agent conflict and it is difficult or expensive for the principal to verify what the agent
is actually doing. The second is the problem that arises when the principal and agent
have different attitudes toward risk, which can lead to different preferred actions.
Agency theory has its roots in information economics, and the theory has developed
along two lines; positivist and principal-agent research Uensen 1983). The two lines
share a common unit of analysis and use the same agency cost-minimizing tautology, but
differ in their mathematical strictness. Positivist research is less mathematical and more
empirically oriented than principal-agent research. The positivist researchers have
focused mainly on the principal-agent relationship between owners and managers of
large corporations (e.g., Jensen and Meckling 1976, Fama 1980, Fama and Jensen
1983), whereas principal-agent researchers are concerned with a general theory of the
principal-agent relationship (e.g., Demski and Feltham 1978, Harris and Raviv 1979).

<-----Page 4----->The results of the two lines also show some differences (Eisenhardt 1989). A common
approach in the positivist research is to identify a behaviour in which stockholder and
management interests diverge and to demonstrate that information systems (e.g.,
budgeting systems, reporting procedures and board of directors) or outcome-based
incentives solve the agency problem. The principal-agent line is more focused on the
contract between the principal and the agent. A common approach is to use a subset of
agency variables (e.g., task programmability, inforrriation systems and outcome uncertainty) and predict whether the contract is behaviour- or outcome-based. The
assumption is that principals and agents choose the most efficient contract.

2.2 Agency theory and small Jim
One assumption in this study is that agency theory can provide a helpful guide to explain
the relationship between private investors and small firms. Why is agency theory
interesting in this respect?
In her analysis regarding the development and present status of agency theory,
Eisenhardt (1989) outlines some recommendations for future research in order to
advance agency theory. O n e of these recommendations is to focus on theory-relevant
contexts. Agency theory is relevant in situations in which contracting problems are
difficult, such as situations where there is (1) substantial goal conflict between principals
and agents, (2) sufficient outcome uncertainty, and (3) unprogrammed jobs in which
evaluation of behaviours is difficult. According to Eisenhardt (1989) small firms is one
topic where studies can provide most leverage for agency theory.
Barnea et al. (1981) have also pointed out that agency problems tend to arise in small
firms because the level of asymmetric information, or differences in information available
to the entrepreneur and outside investors, is greater, and the agent has the capacity and
incentive to affect wealth transfers between different parties. The greater the asymmetry
of information, the easier it is for the entrepreneur to take actions detrimental to the
interests of others. This problem is exacerbated in the small firm because information
about small firm managers engaging in such activities may be less subject to control in
the managerial labour market (Pettit and Singer 1985). Furthermore, the agents are not
motivated to disclose their information for fear that it might be used against them, socalled information impactedness (Kaplan and Atkinson 1989). The information
asymmetry is particularly pronounced for small and young firms in dynamic industries.
The entrepreneurs in these firms have much greater knowledge of their firm than
external investors and may not easily be able to communicate this knowledge to outsiders
because much of the knowledge is intangible (Mason and Harrison 1990). Other reasons
to focus on agency theory can be summarized in the following way:
Agency theory has been developed on a relatively high level of abstraction, but the
theory is to a limited extent tested in empirical situations.
In the literature agency costs are thought to be a major impediment to small firms
in their attempts to obtain external financing Uensen and Meckling 1976, Barnea et
al. 1981, Pettit and Singer 1985).
Studies of the venture capital market in the USA have shown that agency theory
could be a helpful theory to explain the relationship between formal venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs (Sapienza 1989), and that monitoring the financial
and operation performance is one of the most time-consuming activities of formal
venture capitalists (MacMillan et al. 1988).

2.3 Moniton'ng in the principal-agent relationship
Monitoring refers to the principals' control to determine whether the agents have lived
up to the provisions of the contract and to prevent the agent's misuse of assets due to
conflicts of interest. In Jensen and Meckling's (1976) definition, monitoring refers to
more than just measuring or observing the behaviour of the agent. It also includes eflbrts
to 'control' the behaviour of the agent through budget restrictions, operating rules, etc.
For the private investor it sounds reasonable to try to monitor the activities of the entrepreneurs in the firms where he or she has invested money.
In the case where the principal does not have complete information about the agent's
behaviour, as in the case of external investors, two options exist. The principal can use
surveillance mechanisms (budget systems, reporting procedures, board of directors, and
additional layers of management) or the principal can reward the agent based on
outcomes (e.g., profitability). Such outcomes are surrogate measures for behaviours
(Eisenhardt 1985).
Following such reasoning Ouchi (1977, 1979) suggests two underlying control
strategies. Control is in Ouchi's terms defined as a process of monitoring something,
comparing it with some standards, and providing rewards and adjustments. The strategy
of control can be either behaviour- or outcome-based. The behaviour-based control refers
to an agreement between the principal and the agent which concerns a certain behaviour
that in some way will be rewarded, whereas outcome-based control refers to the
principal's measurement of certain outcomes and the reward will be based on this
measurement. According to Ouchi (1977), the choice between behaviour- and outcomebased control depends on two dimensions: knowledge of transformation process and
availability of output measures. To use a behaviour-based control, i.e., to continuously
observe the agent's bahaviour, the principal requires a causal knowledge of what is
required to attain a desired outcome. When the principal uses outcome-based control,
i.e., to measure the agent's attained results, the transformation process need not be
known at all, but a reliable and valid measure of the desired outputs must be available.
Figure 1 shows which types of control are possible due to the above-mentioned
dimensions.

Ouchi's model refers to the relationship between the organizational structure and the
control system and not the relationship between the firm and external partners. It can
also be noted that agency theory treats the contracts as a dichotomy: behaviour- vs.

<-----Page 6----->outcome-based. However, contracts can vary on a continuurn betwecn behaviour- and
outcome-based contracts. According to Eisenhardt (1989), the use of a broader spectrum
of possible contracts can be u s e f ~ to
~ l expand agency theory.

Objectives, model and definitions

Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 15:50 22 September 2009

In the light of this description it sounds reasonable to assume that agency theory can be
valid in the relationship between private investors and their portfolio firms, and
especially with respect to the investors' need to monitor the activities of the entrepreneur.
Therefore, in the present study agency theory's validity should be tested in the relationship between private investors and their portfolio firms by answering the following
questions:
What context factors influence the private investor's monitoring behaviour?
How does context influence the performance of the portfolio firms?
How does the private investor's monitoring behaviour impact on the performance
of the portfolio firms?
The design of the study has to a high degree been influenced by Sapienza (1989).
Sapienza used agency theory as a theoretical framework for his study of the formal
venture capital market in the USA. Figure 2 presents a simple model of the private
investor-entrepreneur relationship. The model implies that the context variables will
influence the principal's monitoring behaviour but also affect the performance of the
portfolio firms. The way of monitoring the portfolio firms will also affect the performance
variables. T h e specific hypotheses regarding the relations will be discussed in section 4.

Figure 2. Model of the private investor-entrepreneur relationship

Thus, one basic premiss in this study is that the principal's monitoring is largely an
outcome of the context of the private investor-entrepreneur relationships. The context
variables can be categorized as:
portfolio firm characteristics, e.g., the firm's innovation level and development
stage;
environment characteristics including the environmental variability regarding
market, technology, competition and suppliers;
entrepreneur characteristics, e.g., the entrepreneur's industry experience, small
business experience, management experience and financial experience;

dyadic characteristics, e.g., the entrepreneur's ownership share and the geographical distance between the private investor and entrepreneur;
private investor characteristics with respect to the investor's knowledge about the
portfolio firm's tansformation process.
As monitoring variables I will use the concepts 'active' and 'non-active' control, which in
a broad sense corresponds with Ouchi's (1977) concepts behaviour- and outcome-based
control. It is assumed that more active control produces a higher level of information
process across the private investor-entrepreneur relationship and that the private
investor is more involved in the portfolio firm's operation. Thus, in the concept active
control I will include a high frequency of contacts between the private investor and entrepreneur, and a more operational involvement of the investor in the portfolio firm.
Two variables are viewed as measures of performance; (1) performance of the portfolio
firm, including the portfolio firm's development in the dimensions size and financial
results, and (2) relationship perfbrmance, including the entrepreneur's assessment of
how far the private investor-entrepreneur relationship has come up to their expectations.

4.

Hypotheses

Of course, there are many interesting hypotheses regarding the private investor-entrepreneur relationship. In this section some hypotheses generated from agency theory will
be presented. This holds especially true for the hypotheses regarding the impact of
context on monitoring variables.

4.1

Impact

of context

on monitoring variables

In section 3 the context variables were categorized in five dimensions: portfolio firm
characteristics, environment characteristics, entrepreneur characteristics, dyadic
characteristics and private investor characteristics.
The portfolio firm characteristics can be expected to affect the private investor's way of
monitoring the entrepreneur. According to Ouchi (1977) more behaviour-based control
will be used in situations where the availability of output measures is low. This is the
situation in highly innovative firms and firms in early stages. Furthermore, high
innovation firms may involve technology that is not well understood by the private
investor. The information asymmetries increase the threat of opportunism which leads to
more active control. In early stage firms the risk of failure is high. This also leads to a
need for frequent contacts and more active control. In accordance with this reasoning the
following hypotheses can be formulated:
Hypothesis l a : The higher the innovation level of the firm, the more the private investor
will rely on more active control.
Hypothesis l b : The earlier the stage of the firm, the more the private investor will rely on
more active control.
Environmental characteristics will also affect the monitoring behaviour. As the
environment becomes more variable, information will have to be processed more
frequently. Under conditions of high variability, performance evaluation becomes more
difficult Uensen and Meckling 1976) and more evaluation mechanisms are likely to

<-----Page 8----->evolve (Bourgeois 1985). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that variability in the
environment will force a more active control. T h e hypothesis is:
Hypothesis 2: The more variable the environment becorncs, the morc the private investor
will rely on more active control.

Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 15:50 22 September 2009

Entrepreneur characteristics in the form of the entrepreneur's experience have a n impact
o n the private investor's need for monitoring. Klein and Leffler (1981) found that
experienced managers are less likely to behave opportunistically because they d o not
want to jeopardize their reputations. Furthermore, inexperienced entrepreneurs pose
greater business risks, motivating the private investor to develop a n active control in
o r d e r t o monitor the firms more carefully. T h i s implies that experienced entrepreneurs
will require a non-active control from the private investor but that less experienced entrepreneurs will need a more active control.
Hypothesis 3 : The less the experience of the entrepreneur, the more the private investor
will rely on more active control.
Dyadic characteristics a r e defined as the entrepreneur's ownership share a n d the geographic distance between the private investor a n d the entrepreneur. T h e eff'ccts of
ownership o n managerial incentives are one of the core issues of agency theory. O n e
suggestion will b e that a n entrepreneur who owns a large share of the firm will require
little control, because his incentives will be in line with those of outside owners.
Furthermore, a s the ownership of the outside investors increases, the need for control will
increase. T h e reasons for this are: (1) the risk that the entrepreneur will consume the
firm's resources will increase, and (2) the investor's exposure to business risks increases
with higher equity stake. A s a result, the private investor will take a more active role in
the firm when his ownership level is high. Furthermore, greater geographic distance
between the private investor a n d entrepreneur will reduce the feasibility of a higher
frequency of contacts a n d a more operational relationship. T h i s reasoning leads to the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 4a: The lower the relative ownership level of thc entrepreneur, thc more the
private investor will rely on rnorc active control.
Hypothesis 4b: The smaller the geographic distance between the entrepreneur and private
investor, the more the private investor will rely on morc active control.

T h e private investor characteristics refer to the investor's knowledge of the portfolio
firm's transformation process, here defined as the knowledge about the firm's market and
technology. According to Ouchi (1977) more behaviour-based control will be used in
situations where the principal's knowledge of the transformation process is good. This
will give rise to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5: The more the private investor knows about the portfolio firm's transformation process, the more the private investor will rely on more active
control.
In Table 1 the hypothesized impact of the context on the private investor-entrepreneur
relationships is summarized.

Impatl

of context

on pe$onnance

In this subsection the hypotheses that relate context variables to the performance of the
portfolio firms are discussed and formulated.
The portfolio firm characteristics are divided into the portfolio firm's innovation level
and development stage. It is intuitively appealing that high innovation levels should
result in better performance of the firm. This has also been confirmed in empirical
research (Cooper et al. 1986). O n the other hand, earlier development stages can be
expected to be subject to negative cash flows and returns. Thus, the wisdom of practitioners and empirical research suggest the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 6a: The higher the innovation level of the firm, the better the performance of
the portfolio firm.
Hypothesis 6b: The later the development of the firm, the better the performance of the
portfolio firm.
The effects of environment characteristics on organization performance have been
discussed in management literature for a long time (e.g., Emery and Trist 1965,
Thompson 1967, Lawrence and Lorsch 1969). In the past many researchers have
proceeded from the hypothesis that variability deteriorates performance, because
management finds the task of adjusting the organization to the environment more
difficult. Thus, a negative relation is anticipated between the level of variability and the
performance. The following hypothesis will therefore be formulated:
Hypothesis 7 : The more variable the environment becomes, the lower the performance of
the portfolio firm.
There exists a strong belief among practitioners and researchers that the entrepreneur
characteristics such as the entrepreneur's experiences are related to the firm's success.
For example, Cooper and Bruno (1977) found that market experience and technological
experience were positively related to a firm's success in high technology-based firms.
Similar results have been obtained by Sandberg and Hofer (1987) and Timmons et al.
(1987).
Hypothesis 8: The greater the entrepreneur's experience, the better the performance of the
portfolio firm.
The dyadic characteristics are measured through the variables of entrepreneur ownership
share and geographic distance. Agency theory suggests that the principal must have
active control when the agent has low relative ownership share, because the agent will
have less incentive to be careful with the resources of the firm. Private investors may also

<-----Page 10----->provide additional resources to the firms in which they have a higher equity share. O n
the other hand, it is possible that entrepreneurs with low ownership share will have
decreased profit motivation. It is assumed that these tendencies will compensate for each
other. Furthermore, a greater geographic distance between the private investor and
entrepreneur can be expected to adversely influence the private investor's ability to
provide resources to the firm and therefore to its performance.

Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 15:50 22 September 2009

Hypothesis 9a: There will be no relation between the entrepreneur's ownership share and
the performance of the portfolio firm.
Hypothesis 9b: The greater geographic distance between the private investor and entrepreneur, the lower the performance of the portfolio firm.
Finally, private investor characteristics refer to the private investor's knowledge of the
portfolio firm's transformation process. It is appealing to think that if the private investor
has good knowledge of the portfolio firm's market and technology, he can provide
additional resources to the firm and this will lead to better performance by the portfolio
firm. The hypothesis will therefore be formulated in the following way:
Hypothesis 10: The more the private invcstor knows about the portfolio firm's transformation process, the better the pcrformance of the portfolio firm.
Table 2 summarizes the hypotheses regarding the effects of the context on pcrformance.

uariubles on perj$omzunce

Finally, in this subsection the hypotheses that relate the monitoring variables to
performance are discussed and formulated. The assumption is that the monitoring
variables influence not only the performance of the portfolio firm, but also the
relationship performance. Studies (Sapienza 1989, Landstrom 1991) regarding the
formal venture capital industry have shown that higher frequency of contacts, more open
communication and more operational work by the investor in the portfolio firms affect
both the relationship and performance.
T h e monitoring variables are divided into two dimensions: frequency of contacts and
operational work in the portfolio firms. One basic assumption in the study is that the
purpose of the ~ r i v a t einvestor's involvement in the portfolio firm is to add value. It

<-----Page 11----->209

sounds reasonable that greater frequency of contacts will provide greater opportunity for
the private investor to add value to the portfolio firm.
Hypothesis 11: The greater the frequency of contacts between the private investor and
entrepreneur, the better the relationship performance and the performance
of the portfolio firm.

Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 15:50 22 September 2009

Agency theory suggests that when the threat of opportunism is great (for example, when
the entrepreneur is the only source of knowledge or when the entrepreneur's share of
ownership is low), then operational work in the portfolio firms is developed to deal with
the agency risk. The private investor-entrepreneur relationships are usually
characterized by a relatively high level of agency risks. Furthermore, as for the frequency
of contacts, operational work in the portfolio firm should give the private investor greater
opportunity to add value, which will lead to a better performance by the portfolio firm.
Hypothesis 12: The greater the private investor's operational work in the portfolio firm, the
better the relationship performance and the performance of the portfolio
firm.
Table 3 summarizes the expected impact of the monitoring variables on relationship
performance and the performance of the portfolio firm.

This study is based on a survey of manufacturing and technology-based firms in Sweden.
Three geographic areas in southern Sweden and 11 science parks were selected for the
study. T h e criteria for the sample in the three geographic areas were manufacturing
firms with up to 100 employees. The sample frame was composed of a random sampling
from the database of the Postal Office (PAR). The science parks were studied through a
full-scale survey of the firms located at the science parks. Table 4 summarizes the method
of selection.

mailed to the CEOs of the firms, with a reminder by telephone after two weeks and a
postal reminder after a further one week. Of the 1258 firms 47 firms claimed that they
were not independent juridical firms, not manufacturing firms or were firms with over
100 employees; 16 questionnaires were sent back by the postal services, and it was
assumed that those firms had gone out of business; 31 firms stated that they had discontinued their operation or had gone into bankruptcy. The effective sample frame was
thus 1164 firms, and of these

627 firms were not heard from;
32 firms sent back incomplete questionnaires or questionnaires that were not filled
in;
505 sent back questionnaires that were completely filled in.
Thus, the response rate is 50511164, i.e., 43%. Taking into consideration the relatively
demanding questionnaire, the response rate is quite satisfactory.
The results show inter alia that banks, as might be expected, are the most commonly
used external investor in the firms, followed by suppliers and leasinglfactoring
companies. It is interesting that private investors are used in 62 or 12% of the firms,
which is a surprisingly high percentage. The analyses in this paper are based on those 62
firms which have private investors as (part) owner. In cases where firms declared having
private investors as (part) owner, and there was an indication that the respondent has
been uncertain on definitions and questions, telephone contact was made with the
respondent to clarify the obscurities.

5.2

Variables ured in the study

The variables that have been used in the study were operationalized in the following way
(see Table 5).
Some comments can be made regarding the way in which the variables were
operationalized. For the variable 'innovation level' a biomodal scale is used wherc the
value '0' is assigned to firms with low innovation level, and the value '1' is assigned to
firms with a high innovation level.
T h e variable 'environment variability' has been obtained from a four-item measure.
T h e CEOs were asked to assess the variability in the dimensions, market, technology,
competition and suppliers. The average score of the four items provides a measure of the
variability of the environment with higher values indicating more variable environment.
Also, the variable 'entrepreneur's experience' has been measured by a multi-item
measure including the entrepreneur's experience in the dimensions, industry experience,
small business experience, management experience and financial experience. The
dimensions are weighted equally and the average score provides a measure of the entrepreneur's overall environment experience.
One assumption in the operationalizing of the variable 'private investor's knowledge'
is that the private investor's knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process
will be reflected in the private investor's provision of resources to the portfolio firms. As
indicated, the variable has been obtained from a two-item measure and the average score
provides the measure for the private investor knowledge variable. The variable
'performance of the portfolio firm' is also measured by a two-item measure. The CEOs
were asked to indicate on a five-point scale their firm's development during the last three

5.3 Limitations

of the

study

There are several factors w h ~ c hpotentially restrict the conclusions which may be drawn
and the generalization of the results. First, one such limitation is the size of the sample.
T h e results are based on only 62 firms, and a larger sample would have been preferable
for statistical analyses and generalization purposes. Second, the most serious limitation is
the operationalizing of the variables. Some of the variables are measured through singleitem measures due to the desire to get an acceptable response rate. This can be discussed
since the contents in some of the variables are more comprehensive than can be included
in a single-item measure. Furthermore, the construct validity for separate variables can
be discussed. For example, the assumption regarding the variable 'private investor's
knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process' is that this knowledge will
be reflected in the private investor's provision of resources in the dimensions 'market'
and 'technology'. Likewise, the performance variables are measured through a selfassessment, and it would have been helpful also to have 'objective' performance

<-----Page 14----->measures. Finally, one limitation refers to the generalization of the results. There is a
bias in the study due to the over-representation of manufacturing firms and firms at
science parks. This will make it impossible to generalize the results to the whole
population of firms. Furthermore, the broad definition of 'private investors' makes it
difficult to compare the results in this study with studies of informal investors in the USA
and the UK. This will restrict the possibility of placing the study in a broader context.

Characteristics of the firms surveyed

In the total survey, 41 % of the firms that have no private investor as (part) owner were
started during the 1980s, and 49% were firms with 1 1 0 employees. Compared with the
private investors' portfolio firms 69 % were started during the 1980s and 45 % were firms
with 1 1 0 employees. Thus, this indicates that private investors tend to invest in young
firms but not always in the smallest firms.
Among the private investors' portfolio firms 49% stated that the firm had a principal
product that was completely new on the market when it was launched; 15% of the firms
were in the seed stage of their development; 32 % in the start-up stage, 11 % in early
expansion; 37 % expansion and 23 % were consolidating mature firms.
T h e entrepreneurs' education was rather high: 18% of the entrepreneurs hold a PhD
degree. O n average they have 13 years of industry experience and 11 years of small
business experience. The entrepreneurs were usually the minority shareholder in the
firms. The average ownership share was 30%.
As mentioned above, the private investor was (part) owner in 12% of the firms
surveyed. Compared with other studies reported in Mason and Harrison (1990) this is a
very high percentage. The reason for the high percentage of private investors in the
present study is due to the fact that a broad definition of private investors has been used
and that the study was done on manufacturing firms and firms at science parks. Fortyfour per cent of the firms with private investors as (part) owner have 'private individuals'
as private investor, 32% consultants, 31 % CEOs in other firms, 10% investors on the
exchange and in 32% of cases venture capital companies which are owned by private
individuals.
An analysis of the geographical distribution of the private investors shows some
interesting tendencies. The firms in (.he community with strong small firm spirit and
firms in provincial areas seem to rely comparatively more on venture capital companies
which are owned by private individuals, whereas firms in metropolitan areas and science
parks seem to rely on private individuals, consultants and CEOs in other firms.
In geographical terms, the relationship is formed between parties that are quite close.
T h e distance between the private investor and the entrepreneur was less than 250 km in
79% of cases, and less than 50 km in 60%. The frequency of contacts between the
investor and the portfolio firms varies. Usually the respondents indicate contacts 'daily'
(13%), 'weekly' (40%) or 'monthly' (25%). The most common way of organizing the
co-operation between the private investor and the portfolio firm was by board meetings,
informal contacts and economic reports. No active co-operation was uncommon.
Compared with the formal venture capital companies in Sweden (Landstrom 1990) the
results show a somewhat closer and more active co-operation by the private investors in
Sweden.
The portfolio firms' expectations of the co-operation with the private investor have in
many cases been fulfilled: 74% of the entrepreneurs considered that their expectations in
relation to the private investor had been realized to a large or a very large extent.

Results

This section presents the results aimed at answering the questions posed in section 3 .
What context factors influence the private investor's monitoring behaviour? How does
context influence the performance of the portfolio firms? How does the private investor's
monitoring behaviour impact on the performance of the portfolio firms? The section is
organized into two main subsections; (1) the correlations between the variables, and (2)
the empirical evidence concerning the formulated hypotheses.

7 . 1 Correlations between the variables
This subsection examines the correlations between the variables used as independent
predictors of the private investor's monitoring behaviour and the performance. The
primary interest is to examine the extent to which multicollinearity can be expected to
confound the results of the regression analyses conducted to test the hypotheses.
In Table 6 the correlations between the context variables are presented. The table
shows that none of the correlations are above 0.50. A low correlation indicates that the
variables are tapping different aspects of the context of the private investor-entrepreneur
relationships, and it appears that multicollinearity should not be a serious threat to the
regression analyses.

No strong correlations exist between the context variables. Also, the table shows few
surprising correlations. There exists a correlation between high innovation level and
firms in earlier development stages (R = - 0.37). The reason may be the over-representation that exists in the study of firms at science parks. Entrepreneurs in innovative firms
and entrepreneurs in firms in earlier development stages experience a larger variability in
the environment ( R = 0.26 respectively R = - 0.22). Furthermore, entrepreneurs in
these firms have less experience in the fields of industry, small business, management and
financing (R = - 0.25 respectively R = 0.33). However, it is interesting to note that
entrepreneurs with greater experience perceive greater uncertainty in the environment
than do those with less experience ( R = 0.26). An explanation may be that more
experienced entrepreneurs are more keenly aware of the variabilities facing them. Not
surprisingly, there exists a negative correlation (R = - 0.29) between high innovation
level and private investors' knowledge about the firms' transformation process. Finally,
there exists a negative correlation ( R = - 0.27) between geographic distance and the
entrepreneurs' experience, i.e., entrepreneurs with long experience, and who have been
active in the same locality for a long time, find it easier to identify private investors in
close geographic proximity.

<-----Page 16----->Table 7 shows the correlation between the monitoring variables (frequency of contacts
and operational work). It is reasonable to expect that the monitoring variables will
influence one another. Therefore, it is not surprising to find a relatively high correlation
between the variables.

The correlation is lower than 0.50, but is all the same rather high, and therefore there
exists a risk of multicollinearity when the variables are used as independent variables.
Finally, Table 8 presents the correlation between the performance variables
(performance of the portfolio firm and relationship performance). Because these variables
are only used as dependent variables there is no concern about multicollinearity.
The correlation is low (R = - 0.09) indicating that the variables measure different
dimensions of the performance.

7.2 Empirical evidence concerning the hypotheses
A basic assumption in this study is that private investors attempt to manage the agency
risks inherent in a particular firm through the level of their involvement. This implies
that private investors' involvement will vary according to the level of agency risk inherent
in the situation.
Table 9 presents the results of regressing the seven context variables against frequency
of contacts in the private investor-entrepreneur dyad.
The results in Table 9 show that only two of the seven hypotheses are supported. As
predicted, smaller geographic distance is significantly related to more frequent contacts
in the private investor-entrepreneur relationship (H4b). There is also a strong indication
that the frequency of contacts increases when the private investor has more knowledge
about the portfolio firm's transformation process (H5). The hypothesis that the
frequency of contacts should be higher when the portfolio firms are characterized by high
innovation level is not supported (Hla). O n the contrary, there is a relation between
higher innovation level and lower frequency of contacts. None of the other hypotheses is
supported, one hypothesis (H3) in the expected direction and two hypotheses ( H l b and
H2) in the opposite direction compared with what was expected.
The predicted direction of the relations between context variables and operational
work is identical to what has been predicted between context and frequency of contacts.
Table 10 presents the results of the regression analysis testing the hypotheses regarding
the effects of context on the private investor's operational work in the portfolio firms.

As in the case of frequency of contacts the results show few supported hypotheses
regarding the private investors' operational work in the portfolio firms. Only two
hypotheses are supported. As predicted, smaller geographic distance (H4b) and greater
private investor knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process (H5) are
related to operational work. Contrary to prediction, a higher innovation level is related to
less operational work (Hla).
The other variables contribute little to explaining variations in the operational work by
the private investors in the portfolio firms. No support is found for the view that earlier
development stages (Hlb), higher environment variability (H2), less experience on the
part of the entrepreneur (H3), and lower level of the entrepreneurs' ownership share
(H4a) result in more intensive operational work from the private investor.
To summarize, it appears that only two of the context variables chosen in this study
explain the frequency of contacts and operational work in the private investor-entrepreneur relationship. These variables show the following:
Greater geographic distances impede frequency of contacts and operational work.
More knowledge from the private investor about the portfolio firm's transformation process supports higher frequency of contacts and operational work.

<-----Page 18----->The results indicate that it is not the required level of control which is the most influential
in determining the frequency of contacts and operational work. It is rather the feasibility
for active involvement that seems to be most influential, i.e., the geographic distance and
the private investor's knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process.
Furthermore, private investors seem to avoid active involvement in young and
technology-based firms.
Seven hypotheses were developed predicting the effects on the performance of the
portfolio firm. Table 11 presents the results on performance of regressing the context
variables.

No support is found for the hypothesis that a higher level of innovation will lead to
better performance (H6a). O n the contrary, a higher level of innovation is negatively
related to performance. As was hypothesized, no relation is observed between the entrepreneur's ownership share and performance (H9a). l'he other variables, development
stage (H6b), environment variability (H7), entrepreneur's experience (H8), geographic
distance (Hgb), and private investor's knowledge (10) exhibit very weak relations with
the performance of the portfolio firms, three in the expected direction and two in the
opposite direction compared with what was expected.
In summary, the results show that it is difficult to find any unequivocal factors for
performance. None of the suggested hypotheses was significantly supported.
Finally, the monitoring variables will be regressed against the relationship performance and the performance of the portfolio firms. Table 12 shows the results of the
regression.
The monitoring variables are most strongly associated with relationship performance.
As predicted, a higher level of frequency of contacts in the private investor-entrepreneur
dyads is related to better relationship performance ( H l l ) , and more operational work
from the private investor in the portfolio firms is also linked with better relationship
performance (H12). O n the other hand, neither of the monitoring variables shows any
relation to the performance of the portfolio firms (HI1 and H12).
I n summary, one premiss behind the formulated hypotheses in this study was that if
the private investor adds value to their portfolio firms it will be accomplished through
their interaction with the entrepreneurs, and such additional value should translate into
better performance. The results show that high frequency of contacts and operational

work contribute to a better relationship performance. This is in line with the traditional
notion that a more active involvement appears to translate into a more positive
relationship. But on the other hand, which is interesting, a more active involvement in
the portfolio firm does not contribute to a better performance of the portfolio firms.

Conclusions

This section summarizes the findings emerging from the regression analyses testing the
formulated hypotheses. The section is divided into four main subsections; (1) empirical
findings, (2) theoretical conclusions, (3) tentative model and (4) implications for
practitioners.

8.1 Empirical jindings
In total 25 hypotheses have been tested. Of these hypotheses six are significantly
supported, while 16 are not supported and three are significantly in the opposite direction
of what was predicted. The significantly supported findings can be summarized in the
following way:
1 Greater geographic distance between the private investor and entrepreneur is
associated with less active control (frequency of contacts and operational work).
2 The private investor's knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process
is associated with more active control (frequency of contacts and operational
work).
3 The level of innovation in the portfolio firm is negatively related to frequency of
contacts.
4 More active control by the private investor is related to a better relationship
performance.
It is also interesting to note some of the results that are not significantly supported. First,
one important assumption in agency theory is that the ownership level influences the

<-----Page 20----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 15:50 22 September 2009

behaviour of the principal and agent. However, the results in this study show no relation
between the entrepreneur's ownership level and the private investor's monitoring
behaviour .
Second, there exists a negative relation between the level of innovation and the
performance of the portfolio firms. It suggests that beyond a certain point of innovation
level, the pursuit of a higher level of innovation in ineffective and even dysfunctional.
Third, an interesting result is the lack of a significant relation between the entrepreneur's experience and the performance of the portfolio firm. The variable 'entrepreneur's experience' has been obtained from a four-item measure including the
dimensions, industry experience, small business experience, management experience
and financial experience. An analysis shows that none of the dimensions is correlated to
performance.
Fourth, there is no significant relation between the principal's knowledge about the
portfolio firm's tranformation process and the performance of the portfolio firm. The
result indicates that the private investor has difficulties adding value to their portfolio
firms. This is additionally accentuated by the final result which shows that the monitoring
variables are not significantly related to the performance of the portfolio firms. None of
the monitoring variables (frequency of contacts and operational work) used in the
regression analyses affect the performance. The results do not support the notion that a
more active involvement from the private investor contributes to the development of the
portfolio firm. However, the study does not answer the question of whether private
investors add more value to portfolio firms than other external investors.

8.2

Theoretical conclusions

This study has used agency theory as the theoretical framework to study the relationships
between private investors and entrepreneurs. It is interesting to note that agency theory
does not satisfactorily explain the private investor's interaction with the entrepreneurs.
This is contrary to what was expected in section 2, and contrary to the results in the study
by Sapienza (1989) regarding the formal venture capital market in the USA. The
assumptions in agency theory, which are based on studies in larger and stable companies,
seem not to be valid in relation to small firms for the following reasons:

1 Agency theory is based on the assumption that both principals and agents are
rational economic-maximizing individuals. This does not hold for either the entrepreneur or the private investor. Studies have shown that entrepreneurs are often
driven by other than purely economic motives. Also, studies of informal investors
in the USA and the U K show that they do not always see the monetary rewards as
the most essential.
2 Agency theory assumes that the principal building control mechanism is to prevent
opportunistic behaviour from the agent (i.e., a 'negative' relationship between the
principal and agent). The relationship between the private investor and entrepreneur has a more 'positive' character, where the interaction is based on support
and mutual trust. In many cases the control mechanism functions as a dysfunctional factor, lowering trust between the principal and agent, which impedes
open communication, etc.
3 Agency theory assumes that there is an information asymmetry between the
principal and agent which facilitates the agent's opportunistic behaviour. The

<-----Page 21----->RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRIVKI'E INVESI'OKS A N D SMAI.I. F I R M S

219

negotiations between the private investor and entrepreneur, and the personal
relationship between them can result in less information asymmetries and less
opportunistic behaviour, and therefore substitute for monitoring solutions.

8.3

Tentative model

One model that has been essential for the reasoning in this study is Ouchi's (1977)
discussion concerning different control strategies (subsection 2.3). My conclusion is that
the model is not applicable in the interaction between private investors and entrepreneurs. More exploratory research must be done to develop a theory of finance which
will be applicable in the small firms situation. In the following I will develop and discuss a
model to explain the interaction between private investors and entrepreneurs. The model
must be seen as a tentative model regarding the private investor's relationship with their
portfolio firms.
In the relationship between private investors and entrepreneurs two dimensions seem
to be essential: 'attitude towards the portfolio firm' and 'interaction basis'. The
dimension, 'attitude towards the portfolio firm', refers to the private investor's way of
looking at the portfolio firm. Either the private investor can regard the portfolio firm as a
'subject' where the private investor's driving force is to support the portfolio firm and
work together with the firm, i.e., it is a question of work as partners, or the private
investor can regard the portfolio firm as an 'object' where the private investor's driving
force is to make money and work less actively with the portfolio firm, i.e., it is a question
of investing. The dimension 'interaction basis' refers to the condition for the interaction
between the private investor and entrepreneur, and the dimension has two aspects. O n
the one hand, it is a question concerning the 'investor basis', i.e., the private investor's
capacity to provide capital and relevant expertise to the portfolio firm. O n the other
hand, it is a question of the 'portfolio firm basis' which includes the entrepreneur's
sensibility to external support and the portfolio firm's situation. For example, in many
cases it can be difficult to provide expertise to young technology-based firms because of
the lack of economic models for young firms.
Generated from the empirical findings some interaction strategies in the private
investor-entrepreneur relationship can be formulated. The dimension 'attitude towards
the portfolio firm' influences the way of organizing the interaction. Private investors who
regard the portfolio firm as a 'subject' have a tendency to work more informally with
their portfolio firms. O n the other hand, private investors who regard the portfolio firm
as an 'object' will rely more on formal interaction, such as attending board meetings and
by way of keeping abreast with economic reports. The dimension 'interaction basis'
seems to influence the frequency of contacts between the private investor and the entrepreneur. The frequency of contacts is high when the interaction basis is sufficient, while
the frequency of contacts is lower when the interaction basis is more limited.
The above reasoning leads to the following interaction strategies in the private
investor-entrepreneur relationship (Figure 3). The model gives implications on two
levels: the portfolio level and the individual case level. O n the portfolio level, i.e., where
we look at the private investor's portfolio as a whole, the focus is on different interaction
strategies and the reasoning leads to a classification scheme of different categories of
private investors.

Figure 3. Different interaction strategies i n the private investor-entrepreneur
relationship

1 An interaction strategy with high frequency of contacts and informal interaction

may be used by private investors that work in the firm's business environment,
e.g., consultants and technical experts, what we can call 'business partners'.
2 A high frequency of contacts and a formal interaction could be expected to
characterize more 'professional investors', who may establish a company around
their investments.
3 Private investors working in line with a strategy characterized by a low frequency
of contacts and an informal interaction may be called 'discreet partners'.
4 An interaction strategy characterized by a passive involvement, i.e., a low
frequency of contacts and a formal interaction may be called 'anonymous
investors'. For example, private investors with no prior relationship with the firm
who invest small amounts of capital may work in accordance with this interaction
strategy.
O n the individual case level, i.e., where we look at a separate relationship, the focus is on
the conditions for the interaction. Ouchi's model constitutes a static way of classifying
different kinds of control strategies and the model is discrete (the principal controls the
agent and either by behaviour- or outcome-based control). In contrast to Ouchi's model,
the model above will emphasize the dynamic aspects in the interaction. The interaction
between the private investor and entrepreneur can, on the individual case level, change
over time. T h e interaction s t r a t q y may change depending on changes in the dimension
'attitude towards the portfolio firm' as well as the dimension 'interaction basis'. For
example, when a portfolio firm experiences financial difficulties the private investor may
change his view from an object-view to a subject-view. Of course, other factors also can

<-----Page 23----->contribute to a change in the private investor's way of looking at the portfolio firm. In
addition, the interaction basis can change over time. For example, the investor basis, like
the private investor's expertise within the field of relevance for the portfolio firm, may
improve, and therefore the frequency of contacts will increase. Furthermore, the
portfolio firm basis may improve. For example, when a young firm grows and the
situation becomes more stable and predictable, it will be easier to provide expertise due
to the accessibility to economic models. The result of this reasoning will be that the
interaction strategy is dynamic on the individual case level, even if the interaction
strategy is more static on the portfolio level.

Prmtical implications

T h e results in this study have several implications for practitioners: entrepreneurs,
private investors and policy makers. Some of the implications for the entrepreneurs can
be summarized in the following way:
Entrepreneurs should seek information about the private investor's knowledge of
the firm's market and technology before the decision to sell parts of the firm to
private investors.
Entrepreneurs should seek private investors in close geographic proximity.
Private investors can function as an essential support for the entrepreneur and as a
sounding board, but the entrepreneur should not expect the private investor to
have the capacity to change a bad economic situation for the firm.
Entrepreneurs should strive for frequent, open communication with the private
investor, and not be reluctant to share 'bad news'.
Several of the points above apply also to the private investors. However, some additional
points can be mentioned;
Private investors may work as a sounding board for the entrepreneur, but must
accept that control and autonomy should be given to the entrepreneurial manager,
especially when investing in young and technology-based firms.
If the private investor's goal is to achieve the highest possible economic return, the
advice will be to avoid young and technology-based firms.
T h e number of private investors in Sweden is surprisingly high, but the amount of
capitd is far from sufficient to close the equity capital gap for many small firms. Policy
makers should consider incentives which encourage private investors to invest in small
unlisted firms. Incentives in this direction have been introduced in several countries, and
the experiences have been reported in different studies (e.g., Landstrom 1988, Mason
and Harrison 1991). I n this respect, it is essential that the incentives really appeal to the
private investors. T h e present study provides a typology which makes it possible to direct
the incentives toward different categories of private investors.
