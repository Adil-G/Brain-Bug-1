word signals a basis for trust resulting from
sharing and mutuality (Macauley, 1963; Rousseau, 1995). Notwithstanding our differences in
emphasis and approach, if our disciplines are to
communicate, we must assume that others are
seeking some common meanings, just as we are.
Without that assumption, we will not make a
good-faith effort to understand one another, referred to by Sabel as the "act of charity" (1993:
111) necessary to produce mutual intelligibility
out of a mix of ideas and terms. As a result, our
will continue to work at crossdisciplines
purposes and will remain fragmented.
A phenomenon as complex as trust requires
theory and research methodology that reflect
trust's many facets and levels. The features of
trust that characterize the set of papers composing this special issue include

Our task is to adopt a multidisciplinary view
of trust within and between firms, in an effort to
synthesize and give insight into a fundamental
construct of organizational science. We seek to
identify the shared understandings
of trust
across disciplines, while recognizing that the
divergent meanings scholars bring to the study
of trust also can add value.
Disciplinary differences characterizing traditional treatments of trust suggest that inherent
conflicts and divergent assumptions are at work
(Fichman, 1997). Economists tend to view trust as
either calculative (Williamson, 1993) or institutional (North, 1990). Psychologists
commonly
frame their assessments of trust in terms of attributes of trustors and trustees and focus upon
a host of internal cognitions that personal attributes yield (Rotter, 1967; Tyler, 1990; see
Deutsch, 1962, for an example of more calculative framing by a psychologist). Sociologists often find trust in socially embedded properties of
relationships among people (Granovetter, 1985)
or institutions (Zucker, 1986).
These different assumptions are manifest in
our divergent use of language. To some scholars
the term "contract" refers to a legal means for
avoiding risk where trust is not particularly high
(Smitka, 1994; Williamson, 1975); to others the

institutional),
* trust within and between organizations,

This body of work suggests that trust may be a

arrangements
(House,
Rousseau, & Thomas-Hunt, 1995). In effect, to
study trust within and between firms is to ride

the organizational elevator up and down a variety of conceptual levels. Our ride in this elevator will focus on the interconnected hallways
of the contemporary firm, rather than its isolated
corner offices.
It may appear that we believe trust research
reflects casual scholarship because efforts to
date have focused more on charting the territory
than on probing its depths. However, work on
trust, as evidenced by this special issue and a
very insightful recent book by Kramer and Tyler
(1996), is beginning to take a more well-defined
and focused form. As the authors of this special
topic forum demonstrate, trust is at once related
to dispositions, decisions, behaviors, social networks, and institutions. However, despite the
complex (one might say "multiplex") character
of trust, this special issue attempts to promote
the accumulation rather than the fragmentation
of theory and research on trust.
Our goals in this Introduction are to (1) gauge
whether there are common elements underlying
trust as it is viewed across disciplines and different levels of analysis, (2) discuss views scholars hold regarding the dynamics of trust (i.e.,
whether it is static or has phases), and (3) clarify
the multiple ways in which organizational researchers model trust (as cause, effect, or moderator), with the ultimate goal of creating a more
cumulative body of knowledge on trust in and
between organizations. We begin by investigating a series of assumptions about trust.

TESTINGASSUMPTIONS:WHATDO WE
KNOWABOUTTRUST?
To date, we have had no universally accepted
scholarly definition of trust. There is agreement
that trust is important in a number of ways: it
enables cooperative behavior (Gambetta, 1988);
promotes adaptive organizational forms, such
as network relations (Miles & Snow, 1992); reduces harmful conflict; decreases transaction
costs; facilitates rapid formulation of ad hoc
work groups (Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996);
and promotes effective responses
to crisis.
Sometimes, scholars use the term "trust" when
they mean other things, which has been problematic (Sitkin & Roth, 1993). In a very influential
early line of "trust" research, Deutsch (1962), for
instance, uses the term when referring to cooperation within groups. However, cooperation
may result from a variety of reasons unrelated to

July

trust, such as coercion (e.g., court-ordered compliance). This blurring of the distinction between trust and cooperation has led to a fuzziness in the treatment of behavior-based trust
and the construct of trust itself.
To advance our understanding of trust, we
suggest that the concept of trust requires clear
boundaries to usefully inform research and theory. We explore how trust's boundaries are constituted by examining the articles that make up
this special topic forum in relation to boundaries proposed in previous treatments of trust.
We structure our analysis around four key questions about the state of our knowledge regarding trust. We begin with a basic question.

1. Do Scholars Fundamentally Agree or
Disagree on the Meaning of Trust?
To answer this question, let us examine how
trust is defined in the articles in this special
topic forum. Regardless of the underlying discipline of the authors-from psychology/micro-organizational behavior (e.g., Lewicki, McAllister,
& Bies; Mishra & Spreitzer) to strategy/economics (e.g., Bhattacharya, Devinney, & Pillutla)confident expectations and a willingness to be
vulnerable are critical components of all definitions of trust reflected in the articles. The most
frequently cited definition in this special issue
is "willingness to be vulnerable," proposed by
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995).
This contemporary definition plays the central
role in defining trust for McKnight, Cummings,
and Chervany; Mishra and Spreitzer; and Jones
and George. Other authors say the same thing
but with different words: "willingness to rely" on
another (Doney, Cannon, & Mullen) and "confident, positive expectations" (Lewicki et al.).
"Positive expectations" of others defines trust
for Hagen and Choe, Elangovan and Shapiro,
and Das and Teng, whereas trust is a positive
attitude toward others for authors Whitener,
Brodt, Korsgaard, and Werner. Even Bigley and
Pearce, who make a case for the absence of an
overarching definition of trust, characterize it in
much the same way as other authors-as
"vulnerability," "perception," and "preconscious expectation." Our evidence from this contemporary, cross-disciplinary collection of scholarly
writing suggests, therefore, that a widely held
definition of trust is as follows:

<-----Page 3----->1998

Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer

Trust is a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations
of the intentions or behavior of another.
Note that identification of common meaning
of
does not imply that all operationalizations
trust reflect the same thing. For example, clear
evidence exists that interorganizational and interpersonal trust are different, because the focal
object differs (Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, in
press). However, the composition of trust (i.e., the
fundamental elements of its definition) are comparable across research and theory focusing on
parties both inside and outside firms and investigating trust relations from different disciplinary vantage points. We did not expect this result, but it is encouraging to observe.
Across disciplines, there is agreement on the
conditions that must exist for trust to arise. Risk is
one condition considered essential in psychological, sociological, and economic conceptualizations of trust (Coleman, 1990;Rotter, 1967;Williamson, 1993).Risk is the perceived probability of loss,
as interpreted by a decision maker (Chiles & McMackin, 1996;MacCrimmon & Wehrung, 1986).The
path-dependent connection between trust and risk
taking arises from a reciprocal relationship: risk
creates an opportunity for trust, which leads to
risk taking. Moreover, risk taking buttresses a
sense of trust when the expected behavior materializes (Coleman, 1990; Das & Teng, this issue).
Trust would not be needed if actions could be
undertaken with complete certainty and no risk
(Lewis & Weigert, 1985). Uncertainty regarding
whether the other intends to and will act appropriately is the source of risk.
The second necessary condition of trust is interdependence, where the interests of one party
cannot be achieved without reliance upon another. Although both risk and interdependence
are required for trust to emerge, the nature of
risk and trust changes as interdependence increases (Sheppard & Sherman, this issue). Degrees of interdependence actually alter the form
trust may take, with the nature of trust a firm
places in temporary workers being quite distinct
from trust associated with its veteran, core employees. Authors of several articles in this special issue provide frameworks linking forms of
trust to the context of the relationship (Lewicki,
McAllister, & Bies; Sheppard & Sherman). In-

395

deed, the time may be right for an overarching
view of trust across forms of interdependence.
To answer our initial question, scholars do
appear to agree fundamentally on the meaning
of trust. Trust, as the willingness to be vulnerable under conditions of risk and interdependence, is a psychological state that researchers
in various disciplines interpret in terms of "perceived probabilities" (Bhattacharya et al., this
issue), "confidence," and "positive expectations"
(e.g., Jones & George, Hagen & Choe, Das &
variations on the same
Teng, all this issue)-all
theme. Trust is not a behavior (e.g., cooperation),
or a choice (e.g., taking a risk), but an underlying
psychological condition that can cause or result
from such actions. Regardless of the discipline
of the researcher, we share the root assumptions
that trust is psychological and important to organizational life.
Finally, because risk and interdependence
are necessary conditions for trust, variations in
these factors over the course of a relationship
between parties can alter both the level and,
potentially, the form that trust takes. The potential for trust to change gives rise to a second
question.
2. Do Researchers View Trust Statically?
A focus on static and stable phenomena is
characteristic of normal science, which values
precision and control. Indeed, equilibrium seeking is an underlying assumption in such fields
as economics. Given this emphasis, it is not
surprising that scholars often have treated trust
as static. Social psychologists often see trust as
either/or, where one person either completely
trusts or completely distrusts another (Gabarro,
1990, cited in Lewicki et al., this issue). This
static, all-or-nothing view is linked to the predominance in early trust research of laboratory
studies focusing on highly structured games,
such as the Prisoner's Dilemma game (e.g., Axelrod, 1984). Under such conditions, the level of
trust reflects a single point, rather than a distribution along an intra- or interpersonal continuum. However, the fact that trust changes over
and
building, declining,
time-developing,
relationeven resurfacing in long-standing
ships-is evidence from comparative and historical research upon trust in organizations (Miles
& Creed, 1995) and in the broader society
(Fukuyama, 1995).

<-----Page 4----->396

Academy of Management Review

But the question remains whether scholars
pursuing precision and control have focused unduly upon trust as a static rather than dynamic
phenomenon. To answer the question, we examine the articles in this special topic forum in
terms of three phases of trust: (1) building (where
trust is formed or reformed), (2) stability (where
trust already exists), and (3) dissolution (where
trust declines). These phases of trust characterize the ebb and flow of relationships. Characterizing this issue's articles in terms of the phase
upon which they focus helps address how comprehensively scholars have viewed the development of trust.
The building phase is addressed in several
articles: in the emergence of trust in new organizational settings (McKnight et al.) and new organizational relationships (Das & Teng), or in
the context of an existing relationship between
workers and managers (Whitener et al.) where
trust may be created or enhanced. The functioning of trust under stable conditions is central to
the broad treatments given to institutional factors associated with trust by Hagen and Choe
(trust in Japanese society) and Sheppard and
Sherman (trust across different relational forms).
Declining trust is the focal point in articles on
downsizing (Mishra & Spreitzer) and betrayal
(Elangovan & Shapiro), in which the authors explore the effects of reduced trust.
The articles here do not overemphasize stability but address a variety of trust's phases, at
least raising the possibility of a balance in
scholarship on trust and its dynamics. A related
question thus arises. Do scholars recognize that
trust is dynamic but focus only upon a particular
phase? In 4 out of the 12 articles, the authors
consider multiple phases of trust. Processes of
trust building and decline are examined by
Jones and George, as well Bigley and Pearce.
Bhattacharya and his colleagues examine how
firm-based relationships begin and the conditions under which they achieve stability. Finally, Lewicki and his colleagues, by focusing
simultaneously on antecedents of trust and distrust (which they conceptualize as two distinct
constructs), run the gamut-from factors building trust or promoting distrust to conditions that
achieve an equilibrium in each and the dynamics that can move individuals and firms through
distinct levels of trust and distrust.
In answer to the question, scholars do, at
times, focus on multiple phases. However, the

July

tendency of the authors in the majority of articles here is to focus upon building, stability, or
decline and to specify conceptual frameworks
within a particular phase. Such an emphasis on
phase-specific trust may be necessary at this
point in the development of trust scholarship.
Given the dynamic nature of trust, the next
question is related to trust's role in the causal
frameworks researchers employ.
3. Does the Status of Trust As a Cause, Effect,
or Interaction Vary Across Disciplines?
Theorists and researchers of trust may model
the concept as an independent variable (cause),
dependent variable (effect), or interaction variable (a moderating condition for a causal relationship). When economic outcomes are of interest, researchers often conceptualize trust as a
potential cause in choice scenarios framed
around social dilemmas. High trust, perhaps
based on previous experiences with a partner in
a repeated game, tends to result in the decision
to cooperate, which can lead to access to economic gains, as in the classic Prisoner's Dilemma (Axelrod, 1984; Miller, 1992). Trust, thus, is
conceptualized as an independent variable.
Similarly, transaction cost economists view
trust as a cause of reduced opportunism among
transacting
parties, which results in lower
transaction costs (Williamson, 1975). Trust has
also long been found to be an important predictor of successful
and conflictnegotiations
management efforts (Deutsch, 1958), and it has a
direct effect on disputants' responses to mediators attempting to settle disputes (Ross & Wieland, 1996). We note that several articles in this
special topic forum consider trust as a cause.
Elangovan and Shapiro and Jones and George
focus exclusively on trust as an independent
variable.
In contrast, trust can be the result of deep
dependence and identity formation, as has been
the case historically in Japanese firms (Ouchi,
1981). Trust as the result of institutional arrangements is characteristic of a sociological perspective (e.g., Zucker, 1986). Third-party relations
have been found to impact trust, where existing
social structures shape a person's reputation
based upon a third party's ability to tell stories
that corroborate one's trustworthiness (or lack of
it; Burt & Knez, 1996). Further, trust can also be
seen as the result of attributes of the other party,

<-----Page 5----->1998

Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer

such as that party's competence, concern, openness, and reliability (Mishra, 1996). In this special issue trust is conceptualized exclusively as
a result in seven articles (Bhattacharya et al.;
Doney et al.; Hagen & Choe; Lewicki et al.;
McKnight et al.; Sheppard & Sherman; Whitener
et al.). Note that these authors run the gamut of
disciplines-from
psychology and organizational behavior to economics and marketing.
The moderating role of trust in shaping causal
relationships is characteristic of studies of interpersonal behavior in organizations and social
settings, as found in both micro-organizational
behavior and social psychology (e.g., Robinson
& Rousseau, 1994). Mishra and Spreitzer (this
issue) use trust as a cause and moderator in
their modeling of reactions to downsizing,
whereas Bigley and Pearce (this issue), along
with Das and Teng (this issue), systematically
model trust in all three roles.
Our authors model the role of trust in diverse
ways, regardless of their disciplinary base. The
economic focus of Das and Teng and Bhattacharya and his colleagues does not constrain
either article from treating trust as an effect,
despite the trend for economic models to use
trust to explain human choice (Miller, 1992). Similarly, with their micro-organizational behavior
perspectives, Mishra and Spreitzer, Bigley and
Pearce, Elangovan and Shapiro, and Jones and
George view trust, at least in part, as a cause of
the behavior of interest-not simply an outcome
(whereas Lewicki et al., Sheppard and Sherman,
and Whitener et al. do follow in the traditional
use of trust as a micro-organizational behavior
individual response). Das and Teng model the
moderating effects of trust from an economic
viewpoint, whereas Bigley and Pearce and
Mishra and Spreitzer do the same from the vantage point of micro-organizational behavior.
We conclude, therefore, that disciplinary differences do not account for the status given to
trust as an independent, dependent, or moderator variable. Rather, the function of trust in the
causal frameworks researchers model appears
here to reflect richer and more complex crossdisciplinary views.
4. Do Disciplinary Differences Exist in the
Levels of Analysis in Trust Research?
Our last question concerns the level of analysis at which scholars conceptualize trust and

397

related phenomena. Our call for papers emphasized the desire for multilevel perspectives on
trust in and between organizations-reflecting
the array of entities, individuals, dyads, groups,
networks, firms, and interfirm alliances
in
which trust and related processes play a role. It
is commonly assumed that disciplines occupy
different turf in organizational science: psychologists, the individual and occasionally
the
group; sociologists, the group and society; and
economists, the individual or the larger firm.
Strikingly, the great majority of articles in this
special issue include, often exclusively, a focus
on the individual-whether
as trustor (e.g.,
Doney et al.; Lewicki et al.; McKnight et al.;
Mishra & Spreitzer) or trustee (e.g., Elangovan &
Shapiro; Whitener et al.). Analysis at the individual level tends to characterize conceptualizations of trust within firms, particularly the willingness of subordinates to trust their bosses
(Whitener et al.). In five articles the authors address firm-level trust: Das and Teng, exclusively
at the firm level; Hagen and Choe and Sheppard
and Shapiro, in combination with dyadic analysis; Bhattacharya and colleagues, in their analysis of the behavior of firms and agents; and
Bigley and Pearce, who address trust at multiple
levels. Although micro-organizational behavior
researchers predominate at the individual level
and economists at the firm level, neither turf is
"sacred" to a particular field. Scholars from a
variety of backgrounds address phenomena at
any given level.
This special topic forum provides numerous
examples of articles adopting multiple levels of
analysis, as well as a simultaneous consideration of trust within and between firms. Why
might trust require a multilevel analysis, regardless of the disciplinary focus of the scholar?
First, we know that reputation matters, particularly the historical trustworthiness of parties in
previous interactions with others (Burt & Knez,
1996), and it is the social context (e.g., networks)
that makes reputational effects possible. Social
norms shape both the behaviors parties engage
in, as well as their beliefs regarding the intentions of others (Sitkin & Stickel, 1996; Whitener et
al., this issue). Institutions promote or constrain
trust relations (Fukuyama, 1995; Hagen & Choe,
this issue; Smitka, 1994). Thus, microlevel trust
relations are constrained and enhanced by
macro processes
(Sitkin, 1995). Conversely,
broader forms of trust, particularly between

<-----Page 6----->398

Academy of Management

firms, can be influenced by microlevel arrangements-in
particular, how individuals representing each firm relate to each other (Fichman
& Goodman, 1996; Zaheer et al., in press). Thus,
multilevel processes underlie trust, and scholars across a variety of disciplines have embraced this multilevel view.
In sum, what do we know about trust? We find
that trust is a psychological state composed of
the psychological
experiences of individuals,
dyads, and firms. There is a common underlying
definition of trust across scholars from different
disciplines, and this basic definition applies
across trust's levels of analysis and developmental phases. Scholars tend to view trust dynamically but focus on specific phases in developing their conceptual frameworks. Some are
interested in trust's beginning, others in its end,
and still others in trust as an ongoing and stable
phenomenon.
Scholars will continue to debate the kinds of
questions that a cross-disciplinary view raises-whether
contracts are a basis of trust or a
means of reducing risk and whether the language of the marketplace can be used to describe personal relationships-and
they will
puzzle over the question of why one party to a
relationship is willing to trust first (is it selfinterest or good faith?). The broad convergence
of issues and interests in this special topic forum suggests that research on trust from the
perspective of any one discipline is likely to
inform several others.

ISSUES AND IMPLICATIONS
The case for integrating trust across disciplines rests on the common psychological basis
upon which all formulations of trust rest. Pulling
together disparate research on trust requires attention to the context in which trust is studied.
One thing is apparent: scholars operationalize
trust differently, depending on the focus and
phase of trust they study. Trust in one-time
transactions typically derives from the calculus
of gains and losses, weighed by perceived risks.
However, in ongoing relationships the question
is not so much "How much do I trust?" but "In
what areas and in what ways do I trust?"
(Lewicki et al.). We acknowledge that some ongoing relations remain predominantly transactional, with a focus on gains and losses (Williamson, 1975). However, both history and the

Review

July

nature of the interaction between the parties
can shape the form that trust takes.
Scholars who differentiate trust from distrust
(e.g., Lewicki et al., this issue; Sitkin & Roth,
1993), in effect, imply that trust has a "bandwidth," where it can vary in scope as well as
degree. Trust takes different forms in different
relationships-from
a calculated weighing of
perceived gains and losses to an emotional response based on interpersonal attachment and
identification.
Market-based exchanges
may
emphasize calculus more, whereas communal
relationships might emphasize identification.
However, even in the same context, the scope of
trust may vary, depending on the relationship's
history, stage of development, and cues in the
immediate setting. The recognition of variations
in the scope of trust is evident in the writings of
Williamson (1993), who asked where "calculative" trust ends and "people" trust begins.
The bandwidth of trust varies in the same
relationship over time. Moreover, broad and narrow bandwidths characterize different types of
relationships. Where a trustor believes in the
positive intentions of the trustee across a broad
range of situations, bandwidth is great. In contrast, bandwidth is narrow when trust's range is
limited to specific conditions only (Sitkin & Roth,
1993). Lewicki et al.'s differentiation of trust and
distrust as separate concepts is an implicit recognition of variations in bandwidth across relationships where trust (expectations of positive
intentions) and distrust (expectations of negative intentions) can exist simultaneously. To understand how bandwidth functions, we must
consider the different forms of trust included in
the bandwidth.
Different Forms of Trust
Deterrence-based trust emphasizes utilitarian
considerations that enable one party to believe
that another will be trustworthy, because the
costly sanctions in place for breach of trust exceeds any potential benefits from opportunistic
behavior (Ring & Van de Ven, 1992, 1994; Shapiro, Sheppard, & Cheraskin, 1992). Asset specificity effects in the form of switching costs to
parties, as in transaction cost economics, are
examples of deterrence-based trust. The question then becomes whether sanctions foster or
substitute for trust, particularly in interfirm situations (Hagen & Choe, this issue).

<-----Page 7----->1998

Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer

Some have raised the issue that deterrencebased trust is not trust at all (Sitkin & Roth, 1993).
It is clear that sanctions can foster or obstruct
cooperation, which is a behavior. However, although trust promotes cooperation, cooperation
can occur for other reasons as well (e.g., coercion or fear of loss). As trust at its narrowest
bandwidth, deterrence-based trust has the qualities of low distrust/low trust (Lewicki et al., this
issue), where costs of breaching trust are high
and the involvement between the parties is limited in the first place.
In a sense, trust is not a control mechanism
but a substitute for control, reflecting a positive
attitude about another's motives. Control comes
into play only when adequate trust is not
present. For example, a detailed legal contract
is one mechanism for controlling behavior.
However, Macaulay (1963) observes that detailed contracts can get in the way of creating
an effective exchange relationship: in effect,
people do not need to develop trust when their
exchange is highly structured and easily monitored. Although detailed contracts promote limited cooperation based upon deterrence, most
firms that form alliances do so because of a
social network of prior alliances, which makes
detailed contracts less necessary (Kogut, Shan,
& Walker, 1993).
There is an apparent incompatibility between
strict controls and positive expectations about
the intentions of another party. Some controls
actually appear to signal the absence of trust
and, therefore, can hamper its emergence, perhaps by limiting the degree of interdependence
that develops between the parties. Moreover,
belief in the absence of "negative intentions" is
not the same as beliefs in the presence of positive ones-the
latter being a necessary condition of the generally accepted definition of trust.
Deterrence-based trust, therefore, may not be
trust at all but may be closer to low levels of
distrust.
Calculus-based trust, however, is based on rational choice-characteristic
of interactions
based upon economic exchange. Trust emerges
when the trustor perceives that the trustee intends to perform an action that is beneficial. The
perceived positive intentions in calculus-based
trust derive not only from the existence of deterrence but also because of credible information
regarding the intentions or competence of another (Barber, 1983). For instance, credible infor-

399

mation about the trustee may be provided by
others (reputation) or by certification (e.g., a diploma). Such "proof sources" signal that the
are true
trustee's claims of trustworthiness
(Doney et al., this issue). In Lewicki et al.'s (this
issue) framework, this would incorporate the
high trust/high distrust condition. Here, parties
trust but verify under conditions where willingness to trust is limited to specific exchanges
(e.g., financial but not personal). Opportunities
are pursued and risks continually monitored.
The range of calculus-based trust is often limited to situations where evidence of failure to
perform can be obtained in the short term. Risk
may entail short-term performance losses but
not threaten the trustor's broader interests.
Relational trust derives from repeated interactions over time between trustor and trustee. Information available to the trustor from within
the relationship itself forms the basis of relational trust. Reliability and dependability in
previous interactions with the trustor give rise to
positive expectations about the trustee's intentions. Emotion enters into the relationship between the parties, because frequent, longerterm interaction
leads to the formation of
attachments based upon reciprocated interpersonal care and concern (McAllister, 1995). (For
this reason, scholars often refer to this form of
trust as "affective trust" [McAllister, 1995] and as
trust" at its broadest scope
"identity-based
[Coleman, 1990]).
Repeated interactions can vary considerably
in the resources exchanged and in the scope of
interdependence between the parties (from repeated employment of contract labor from the
same agency to career advancement of full-time
employees in a firm). Repeated cycles of exchange, risk taking, and successful fulfillment
of expectations strengthen the willingness of
trusting parties to rely upon each other and expand the resources brought into the exchange.
Thus, an exchange can evolve from an arm'slength transaction into a relationship: from a
"fair day's work for a fair day's pay" arrangement to a high-performance employment relationship characterized by mutual loyalty and
broad support. Citizenship behavior from employees and organizational support from employers are characteristic of high levels of relational trust based upon experience within the
relationship (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchinson, & Sowa, 1986; Organ, 1990).

<-----Page 8----->400

Academy of Management Review

In Lewicki et al.'s (this issue) framework, relational trust entails not only beliefs in the positive intentions of the trustee but also in the absence of negative intentions, giving rise to the
condition of high trust/low distrust. Interdependence between the parties to relational trust is
likely to increase over time as new opportunities
and initiatives are pursued. A dynamic of relational trust is its potential for expansion or contraction, where experiences over time can escalate positive beliefs regarding the intentions of
the other or, conversely, exacerbate negative beliefs (Lewicki et al., this issue; Sitkin & Roth,
1993).
Whereas calculus-based trust is relatively circumscribed, limited as it is to discrete exchanges reinforced by the existence of deterrents, relational trust involves a broader array of
resource exchange (including socioemotional
support, as well as concrete resources) and entails a greater level of faith in the intentions of
the other party. Exchanges based on calculusbased trust are likely to be terminated once violation occurs, but exchanges characterized by
relational trust often are more resilient. Unmet
expectations can be survived when relational
trust exists, particularly if parties make an effort
to restore a sense of good faith and fair dealing
to their interactions.
There is a fine line between the existence of a
good-faith relationship between parties and the
emergence of a shared identity. Two parties
may continually cooperate and share information and assets while still believing that the
other party is "them" instead of "us." However,
there is a tendency for repeated interactions to
create expanded resources, including shared information, status, and concern. These expanded
resources can, in turn, give rise to a psychological identity (Gaertner, Dovidio, & Bachman,
1996). Employees may come to characterize
themselves in relationship to their teammates or
firm as "we," and may derive psychic benefits
from being part of a successful enterprise. Identity-based trust is relational trust at its broadest.
Institution-based trust can ease the way to
formulating both calculus-based and relational
trust. Ex ante deterrents may promote trust, because one's confidence that reputation matters
permits relationships to form in the first place.
Institutional factors can act as broad supports
for the critical mass of trust that sustains further
risk taking and trust behavior (e.g., Gulati, 1995;

July

Ring & Van De Ven, 1992; Sitkin, 1995). These
supports can exist at the organizational level, in
the form of teamwork culture (Miles & Creed,
1995; Whitener et al., this issue), and at the societal level, through such cultural supports as
legal systems that protect individual rights and
property (Fukuyama, 1995).
One example where both organizational and
societal factors affect trust can be found in comparative research on Hungarian firms under
communism (Pearce & Branyicki, in press). The
absence of within-firm procedures for promoting
consistent employee treatment, coupled with the
autocratic nature of the Hungarian government,
undermined trust and good-faith relations between supervisors and subordinates. In contrast, the U.S. firms studied enjoyed the benefits
of standardized
human resource practices
within firms (e.g., performance reviews and
compensation) and legal protections from the
federal government. Not surprisingly, trust between supervisors and subordinates was considerably higher in American firms than in Hungarian ones.
Whether institutional trust is a control or a
form of trust support is a fundamental issue
(Shapiro, 1987). Control, as manifested in laws
and reputational sanctions, acts as a deterrent
from opportunism. These mechanisms, however,
can serve as a springboard for the creation of
trust. Hagen and Choe (this issue) argue that, in
Japan, societal controls function as both a
means of controlling behavior and as a basis for
supporting the development of trust. Conceptualizing trust and distrust as distinct offers insights into how institutions promote trust in societies where the anticipation
of positive
motives can be fostered without high levels of
monitoring, because a legal system makes expectations of harm low-probability events.
Institutional controls can also undermine
trust, particularly where legal mechanisms give
rise to rigidity in responses to conflict and substitute high levels of formalization for more flexible conflict management (Sitkin & Bies, 1994).
Scholars have variously interpreted the tension
between institutional mechanisms creating impersonal forms of trust and less standardized
(but more flexible) interpersonal trust. Based on
research in North American organizations,
Zucker (1986) views institutional mechanisms as
reducing the opportunity for creating interpersonal trust. In contrast, based upon comparative

<-----Page 9----->401

research in Hungary and the United States,
Pearce and Brzenksky (in press) see a minimum
level of institutional trust as sine qua non for the
emergence of interpersonal trust.
The possibility of a step function characterizing the role institutional trust plays in shaping
interpersonal trust remains a subject for future
research. Nonetheless, a variety of institutional
factors, including legal forms, social networks,
and societal norms regarding conflict management and cooperation, are likely to interact in
creating a context for interpersonal and interorganizational trust.
The variations we observe in the bandwidth of
trust across relationships suggest there may be
a tension between acting out of self-interest
(agency) and acting out of the interests of a
broader collective (community). Sabel (1993) suggests that we need to move away from thinking
of trust as rational self-interest toward a shared
sense of community with a common fate. Beliefs
can arise in communities that lead to avoidance
of exploitation, where trusting others is a condition of membership. Such shared understandings between individuals or between firms can
arise out of interactions and from shared or common knowledge.
Indeed, some societies have penalties for putting oneself ahead of community interests
(Hearn, 1904, as cited by Hagen & Choe, this
issue). High power distance societies, such as
Japan, may build obligations into societal roles,
creating codes of conduct that reinforce collective behavior through relational sanctions. In
low power distance societies, such as North
America, mechanisms that support repeated in-

teractions, including stable employment, network ties, and laws protecting property rights of
individuals and firms, may also enable trust
(Nooteboom, Berger, & Noorderhaven, 1997). Our
discussion of bandwidth suggests that institutional mechanisms can play a critical role in
shaping the mix of trust and distrust that exists.
In Figure 1 we model the three basic forms of
trust (calculative, relational, and institutional)
with respect to the issue of bandwidth. (Note
that we conclude that deterrence is not trust and
exclude it from the model.)

trust in only one form in a
Conceptualizing
given relationship risks missing the rich diversity of trust in organizational settings. Recognizing that, in a given relationship, trust has a
bandwidth (which may exist to different degrees
between the same parties, depending on the
task or setting) introduces the idea that experiences over the life of a relationship may lead to
pendulum swings. The interests of each party
separately and their mutual concerns might be
met to a limited degree at any single point in
time-but to a large degree over the life of the
relationship.
Is Trust in Transition?
The form and context of organizations are in
transition. We observe in society a move toward
small-scale relations (Miles & Creed, 1995; Miles
& Snow, 1992). In this era of more flexible forms

of organizing, the breaking up of large firms, the
rise of independent contractors, and shifts in the
prevalent forms of trust are likely. In fact, we
may currently observe a shift from institutional
trust to individual and network-based trust (Saxenian, 1996). Even highly competitive industries,
such as investment banking, manifest evidence
of individual and network-based trust mechanisms, despite high turnover and loose ties to
one another. In a recent study researchers observed friendship or advice relationships or ties
of around 2 percent among investment bankers,
individual
ratings of investment
whereas
banker trustworthiness display inter-rater agreement of .8 (Burt, 1998).
In more fluid work settings, trust may be particularly important for the ability of workers to
self-organize. Where trust is present, it can promote a critical mass of trust-related behaviors,
such as the cooperation needed to create higherunit trustworthiness (Whitener et al., this issue).
In a knowledge-based economy, a trustee's competence, ability, and expertise become increasingly important as an indicator of his or her
ability to act as anticipated.
In this issue McKnight et al. and Sheppard
and Sherman raise the issue of whether new
organizational forms imply new forms of trust,
characterized by changes in the nature of vulnerabilities and risks or changes in bandwidth.
These shifts raise the possibility that violations
of trust may take new and different forms. In a
highly interdependent marketplace, violations
of calculus-based trust may be signs of irrationality, whereas breaches of relational trust may
be indicators of unpredictability at the middle
level and of bad faith and lack of caring at the
highest level (Sheppard & Sherman, this issue).
In sum, the impact of contemporary organizational changes on trust leads us to conclude that
context is critical to understanding trust. Acontextual research will be limited in its ability to
represent the true functioning of trust. Future
empirical research on trust needs to address
whether a particular context has given rise to a
single form of trust (what Lewicki et al. refer to
as "uniplex") or to broader multiplex forms. New
organizational forms built around the management of interdependence will provide a catalyst
for innovative research on trust and its bandwidth into the next millennium.

CONCLUSION
Our disciplines are intellectually dense at different points in the network of constructs (Bigley
& Pearce, this issue). We may be divided by
jargon and tribal identification, but we are part
of the same network of ideas. Despite the common concern regarding our different disciplinary lenses (i.e., "blinders"), we observe considerable overlap and synthesis in contemporary
scholarship on trust. But we have a confession
for the reader: by collaborating across disciplines to identify and develop multilevel, multidisciplinary views of trust, we have stacked the
deck.
This special topic forum has been designed to
reinforce integration and cumulation of insights.
The scholars who have contributed to this special issue have undertaken the challenge to be
consciously integrative in their approaches to
fundamental problems surrounding trust in organizational settings. We applaud AMR's willingness to provide the context and the incentives to support a creative synthesis across
disciplines, and we deeply appreciate the scholarship and creativity of the authors who have
stepped up to the challenge this special issue
offered. Enjoy the product of their efforts. This
special topic forum will have achieved its purpose if it acts as a pointer to further the cumulative nature of research on trust in and between
organizations.
