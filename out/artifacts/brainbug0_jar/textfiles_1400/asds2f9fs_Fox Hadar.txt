Abstract
According to prospect theory, people overweight low probability events and underweight high probability events.
Several recent papers (notably, Hertwig, Barron, Weber & Erev, 2004) have argued that although this pattern holds for
“description-based” decisions, in which people are explicitly provided with probability distributions over potential outcomes, it is actually reversed in “experience-based” decisions, in which people must learn these distributions through
sampling. We reanalyze the data of Hertwig et al. (2004) and present a replication to determine the extent to which
their phenomenon can be attributed to sampling error (a statistical rather than psychological phenomenon) versus underestimation of rare events (i.e., judgmental bias) versus actual underweighting of judged probabilities. We find that
the apparent reversal of prospect theory in decisions from experience can be attributed almost entirely to sampling error,
and are consistent with prospect theory and the two-stage model of decision under uncertainty (Fox & Tversky, 1998).
Keywords: decisions from experience, uncertainty, Prospect Theory, two-stage model, probability learning, decision
weights.

Several recent papers have contrasted “decisions from
description” with “decisions from experience.” In the former, people are explicitly provided probability distributions over potential outcomes; in the latter, probabilities
and outcomes are not provided but must be learned by
sampling from these distributions. Perhaps most notable
is an experiment presented by Hertwig, Barron, Weber
and Erev (2004, hereafter HBWE) that was also described
in detail by Weber, Shafir and Blais (2004) and Hertwig,
Barron, Weber and Erev (2005). In this experiment students either saw six decision problems (e.g., gain 4 points
with probability .8; gain 0 otherwise; for a list of all lottery pairs see Table 1) or sampled outcomes (with replacement) from unlabeled buttons associated with these
pairs of payoff distributions. After sampling draws from
each button as many times as they wished, participants
indicated which lottery they preferred to play once for
real money. The authors characterize their results as follows: “In the case of decisions from description, peo∗ This work was supported in part by the Fulbright Program and the

ple make choices as if they overweight the probability
of rare events, as described by prospect theory. . . .in the
case of decisions from experience, in contrast, people
make choices as if they underweight the probability of
rare events.” They conclude their abstract with a “call
for two different theories of risky choice.” Although we
are sympathetic to the investigation of decisions from experience, we believe that the call for two different theories of risky choice is premature as HBWE’s results are
driven almost entirely by sampling error and are consistent with prospect theory (hereafter PT, Kahneman &
Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) when it is
applied to the probability distributions of outcomes that
participants actually sampled.
To motivate our approach we note that economists
since Knight (1921) have distinguished decisions under
risk, in which objective probabilities of outcomes are
known by the decision maker, from decisions under uncertainty, in which they are not. The experiment of
HBWE thus compared decisions under risk (where lotteries were explicitly described) to decisions under uncertainty (where lotteries were unlabeled buttons). In decisions under uncertainty people’s beliefs may differ from
so-called “objective” probabilities for a variety of rea-

sons. First, experienced probabilities may differ from objective probabilities—as HBWE note, it follows from the
binomial distribution that people are more likely to undersample than over-sample low-probability events, and this
sampling error will be more pronounced the lower the
probability and the smaller the size of the sample taken.1
Second, people judge the probabilities that they have experienced incorrectly. Thus, the question arises to what
extent HBWE’s finding of “underweighting” can be attributed to: (1) sampling error (the difference between socalled “objective” probabilities and probabilities of outcomes that participants actually experienced); (2) judgment error (the difference between experienced probabilities and judged probabilities); and (3) probability weighting (the difference between judged probabilities and their
impact on choices). Breaking down the source of “underweighting” is critical to the interpretation of HBWE’s
results because sampling error is a statistical rather than
1 To illustrate, consider an “experience-based” choice between (a)
a 2.5% chance of 32 points or (b) a 25% chance of 3 points (Decision 6 in HBWE). If 100 participants sample outcomes from each lottery eight times (approximately the median number reported in HBWE)
one would expect 82 participants to sample exclusively zero outcomes
for lottery (a) but only 10 participants to sample exclusively zero outcomes for lottery (b). Thus, one would expect 73 participants to face
an apparent choice between (a) receive nothing or (b) possibly receive
3 points. HBWE characterize the choice of option (b) in this case as
“underweighting” of the low-probability event because—unbeknownst
to participants — the first lottery has a higher expected value than the
second lottery.

psychological phenomenon, judgment error is a bias in
belief rather than preference, and the weighting of these
judged probabilities provides the most apt comparison to
prospect theory.2
If the predominant source of HBWE’s effect is sampling error, one would expect most choices to accord
with prospect theory weights applied to the probabilities that participants actually observed. To test this notion we obtained HBWE’s raw data and tallied the participants in the experience condition (unlabeled buttons)
whose choices were consistent with PT assuming “objective” probabilities (that were known only to the experimenter) versus “experienced” probabilities (proportions of events that participants observed).3 For each
gamble pair we calculated the percentage of participants
who chose the higher PT-valued gamble assuming median value- and weighting-function parameters reported
by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). The results (see Table 1) are striking and consistent over all lottery pairs:
although most participants “violate” PT when the analysis is applied to “objective” probabilities as presented in
2 The two-stage model of decision under uncertainty holds that
prospect theory’s inverse-S shaped weighting function can be applied
to judged probabilities (Fox & Tversky, 1998). Strictly speaking, PT
calls for an alternative measure such as “bounded subadditivity” for decisions under uncertainty (Tversky & Fox, 1995; see also Wu & Gonzalez, 1999). However, the data of HBWE do not lend themselves to such
alternative measures.

HBWE, most conform to the predictions of PT when applied to probabilities that participants experienced, at a
similar rate to decisions from description.
In order to distinguish judgment error from probability
weighting we replicated the method of HBWE, adding an
elicitation of judged probabilities. We asked 46 students
at Ben Gurion University to (1) sample outcomes from
each pair of unlabeled lotteries, (2) choose their preferred
lottery, and (3) recall the possible outcomes of each lottery and then estimate their respective probabilities, counterbalancing the order of judgment and choice tasks (a
fuller account of this experiment will appear elsewhere;
details can be obtained from the authors). The median
correlation among respondents between judged and experienced probabilities was .97 and the median mean absolute error was .06, suggesting that participants were very
accurate.4 When Tversky & Kahneman’s (1992) median
value- and weighting-function parameters were applied
to “objective” probabilities, most choices (60%) violated
PT as in HBWE; however, when this analysis was applied
to judged probabilities, most choices (63%) conformed to
PT. Thus, participants apparently weighted judged probabilities in decisions from experience just as they tend
to weight chance probabilities in decisions from description, consistent with Tversky & Fox’s (1995) “two-stage
model” of decision under uncertainty (see also Fox &
Tversky, 1998; Wakker, 2004). We expect that this model
would have fit even better had predictions been based on
individually measured PT parameters, which are known
to vary somewhat between participants, rather than group
medians (see Gonzalez & Wu, 1999).
We note that HBWE do find some interesting patterns in their data. Notably, participants with small incentives are content to make decisions based on small
samples of information, and more recently sampled information may have greater impact on their decisions.
However, our internal analysis of HBWE’s data and our
replication show that the so-called “underweighting” of
low probability events in decisions from experience is
driven almost entirely by a tendency to undersample lowprobability events—a statistical property of the binomial
distribution—and has almost nothing to do with underestimation of observed probabilities or a tendency to underweight these probabilities. Likelihood judgments correspond very closely with experienced probabilities and
choices are consistent with overweighting low probabilities, as characterized by prospect theory. Thus, the call
for “two different theories of risky choice” seems premature, and future research on decisions from experience
4 Of course the high correlation between judged and experienced
probabilities may be somewhat inflated by the wide range of “objective” probabilities used in this experiment. However, if we examine the
low probability lotteries (p = .025 − . 25) and high probability lotteries
(p= .8 - 1) separately, the correlations remain quite high: .84 and .98,
respectively.

(how much information do they seek), and models of bias
in likelihood judgment.
