Financing the Invention to Innovation
Transition in the United States

ABSTRACT. The basic science and technology research
enterprise of the United States—sources of funding,
performing
institutions,
researcher
incentives
and
motivations—is reasonably well understood by academics and
policy makers alike. Similarly corporate motivations,
governance, ﬁnance, strategy, and competitive advantage have
been much studied and are relatively well understood. But the
process by which a technical idea of possible commercial value
is converted into one or more commercially successful
products—the transition from invention to innovation—is
highly complex, poorly documented, and little studied. In this
paper we discuss the process by which basic research is
converted into successful commercial innovations. Following
Arrow (1962) and Zeckhauser (1996), we explore the hypothesis
that asymmetries of informaion and motivation, as well as
institutional ‘‘gaps,’’ may systematically deter private
investment into early stage technology development. We
describe the role of governments—federal and state (or
provincial)—in promoting the commercial transition from an
invention to an innovation. We conclude by suggesting some
lessons that may be learned from the experience of the
Advanced Technology Program (ATP) of the United States
Department of Commerce, among the few Federal programs
speciﬁcally intended to meet this need.

1. Background
Most economic growth in the U.S. economy, and
indeed all industrial economies, comes from
incremental improvements in existing products
and processes. These incremental improvements

are motivated by a market pressures on ﬁrms to
either improve product performance, reduced cost
of production, or both. In the United States they
are ﬁnanced almost entirely by private investment.
In the last decade total national R&D has risen to
over $250 billion annually, supporting a Gross
National Product of $10,253 billion in year 2000.
Real increases in U.S. national R&D have all come
from industry, increasingly focused on near term
product development. Government funding for
R&D has been approximately ﬂat in inﬂationadjusted dollars.1
As the pace of technical advance quickens and
product cycles compress, established corporations
are increasingly pressured to seek opportunities for
such incremental technological change have intensiﬁed.2 However, incremental technical change
alone is not adequate to ensure sustained growth
and economic security. Sustained growth can
occur only with the continuous introduction of
truly new goods and services—radical technological innovations that disrupt markets and create
new industries.3 Radical technological change, in
turn, is a function of the capacity to turn sciencebased ‘‘inventions’’ into commercially viable
‘‘innovations.’’ As Weitzman (1998, 333) has
noted, ‘‘the ultimate limits to growth may lie not
as much in our ability to generate new ideas, so
much as in our ability to process an abundance of
potentially new seed ideas into usable forms.’’
Understanding the invention to innovation transition is essential in the formulation of both public
policies and private business strategies designed to
more efﬁciently convert the nation’s research
assets into economic assets.4
Policy analyses and political debates relating to
R&D appropriations frequently involve inferences
about economic outcomes from the aggregate

investment of $60 billion in non-defense, publicly
funded R&D.5 The Congress is aware that analyses
at this high level of aggregation do not allow
quantitative evaluation of the relationship between
the policies under which these investments are made
and the economic and social outcomes they produce.
It was for this reason that the Government
Performance and Reports Act—covering not only
R&D programs, but all Federal government programs—was passed in 1993.6 In the context of that
act, every agency that funds research is required
document in their budget submissions, not only
‘‘outputs’’ (measured in terms of in publications,
patents and training) but also outcomes and impacts
in broader economic and social terms. Agencies
have found this requirement difﬁcult to satisfy.
The result is that federal S&T policy, as it relates
to the expectation of economic outcomes, still
depends on the following principles and policies:
.

.

A residue of conﬁdence in the ‘‘social contract
for science’’ that takes as a matter of faith that,
while the outcomes from science are difﬁcult if
not impossible to predict, experience shows
that viewed in hindsight they dramatically
exceed their public costs.7
Statutes intended to increase the incentives for
commercializing government funded science
(technology ‘‘pull’’ policies) of which the
most signiﬁcant was the 1980 Bayh–Dole Act,
allowing universities and other contractors and
grantees to own patents issued from government-funded research.8

A larger number of statutes which can be
characterized as technology ‘‘push’’ polices,
intended to encourage the transfer of government research to commercial enterprises. These
include the Stevenson–Wydler Act and its
amendments, for example encouraging Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs).
Two statutes intended to create government
investments in research to create technologies
of high commercial promise. These include the
Small Business Innovation Research Program
and the Advanced Technology Program
(ATP).9

With the exception of ATP, none of these statutes
was justiﬁed by a detailed model of how government funded advanced research results in high tech
innovations. ATP attempts to invest in that
process directly, and it has been highly controversial politically from the time of its passage in 1988.
What, then, do we know about how radical,
technology-based innovations come about? What
can governments do to foster such innovations? Is
ATP an effective policy tool for this purpose, or it
is merely ‘‘corporate welfare’’ as its critics claim?
In order to answer these questions we ﬁrst
analyze a model of the processes that relate
publicly funded research to successful market
entry of new products or processes—to innovations.10 This analysis emphasizes disjunctures in
the innovation process of relevance to public
policy. We then report ﬁndings from our research
over the past two years concerning the sources of
funding for such ‘‘early stage’’ technology development. We conclude by describing implications
for public policy, focusing on the lessons learned
from a decade of experience with the ATP.

2. Modeling the invention and innovation transition
A diagram of the innovation process that allows us
to deﬁne the ‘‘invention to innovation’’ transition
is presented in Figure 2.11 The arrows across the
top and in between the ﬁve stages of technology
development and funding are intended to suggest
the many complex ways in which the stages
interrelate.12 Figure 2 identiﬁes the stages of
activity, starting with research (phase 1) leading

Figure 2. Sequential model of development and funding. The region corresponding to early stage technology development is shaded
in gray. The boxes at top indicate milestones in the development of a science-based innovation. The arrows across the top of, and in
between, the ﬁve stages represented in this sequential model are intended to suggest the many complex ways in which the stages

A more complete model would address the fact that patents occur throughout the process.

to a technical concept of commercial value that is
protected, perhaps by a patent (phase 2). Phase 3 is
the most critical phase in the transition from
invention to innovation. This is the point at which
the technology is reduced to industrial practice, a
production process is deﬁned from which costs can
be estimated, and a market appropriate to the
demonstrated performance speciﬁcations is identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. Phase 3 (shaded) is that to
which we are referring when we employ the phrase
‘‘early stage technology development’’ (ESTD) as
deﬁned in the box at the opening of this chapter.
When ESTD work is completed, product development (phase 4) begins. A pilot line is produced and
the enterprise is ready to enter the market. At this
point an innovation is achieved, and in phase 5
that market is explored with product, customers
provide feedback for product development, and a
business is created which is ready to be ﬁnanced or
perhaps acquired.
The ﬁrst two phases lie in the domain of the
research enterprise and may be publicly funded.
The technical entrepreneurs who create the concept in phase 2 may have little business experience,
but they may have high commitment to their
technical vision. The venture capital industry,

always looking for opportunities to invest where
the returns may by high enough to justify the
business risks are unlikely to take the opportunity
seriously until phase 5 is reached. In some cases
they will invest, in an exploratory fashion, in
phase 4.
The speciﬁc region of the innovation space in
which we are most interested is bounded at the
earliest stage with the veriﬁcation of a commercial
concept through laboratory work and extends
through the identiﬁcation of what looks like an
appropriate market, and perhaps the creation of
protectable intellectual property. Congressman
Vern Ehlers, among others, uses the term ‘‘Valley
of Death’’ to dramatize the particular challenges
facing entrepreneurs engaged in the transition
from invention to innovation. This term reinforces
the ‘‘capital gap’’ perspective on early stage
innovation: champions of early stage projects
must overcome a shortfall of resources.13

3. Institutional and behavioral disjunctures
The imagery of the Valley of Death (which
connotes Death Valley in Nevada, USA) suggests

<-----Page 3----->230

Auerswald and Branscomb

a barren territory when, in reality, between the
stable shores of the S&T enterprise and the
business and ﬁnance enterprise is a sea of life
and death of business and technical ideas, of ‘‘big
ﬁsh’’ and ‘‘little ﬁsh’’ contending, with survival
going to the creative, the agile, the persistent. Thus
we propose an alternative image: the ‘‘Darwinian
Sea.’’
In Branscomb and Auerswald (2001) we identiﬁed the challenges of the ‘‘Darwinian Sea’’ in the
following terms:
1. Differing motivations for research. Initially an
innovator demonstrates to his or her own
satisfaction that a given scientiﬁc or technical
breakthrough could form the basis for a
commercial product (proof of principle). However, a substantial amount of difﬁcult and
potentially costly research (sometimes many
years’ worth) will be needed before the envisioned product is transformed into a commercial reality with sufﬁcient function, low enough
cost, high enough quality, and sufﬁcient market
appeal to survive competition in the marketplace. Few scientists engaged in academic
research (or the agencies funding their work)
have the necessary incentives or motivation to
undertake this phase of the reduction-to-practice research.
2. Disjuncture between technologist and business
manager. On each side of the Darwinian Sea
stands a quite different archetypal character: the
technologist on one side, and the investor/
manager on the other. Each has different
training, expectations, information sources,
and modes of expression. The technologist
knows what is scientiﬁcally interesting, technically feasible, and fundamentally novel in the
approach proposed. In the event of failure, the
technologist risks a loss of reputation, as well as
foregone pecuniary returns. The technologist is
deeply invested in a vision of what could be. The
investor/manager knows about the process of
bringing new products to market, but may have
to trust the technologist when it comes to
technical particulars of the project in question.
What the investor/manager is generally putting
at risk is other people’s money. The investor is
deeply invested in producing a proﬁtable return
on his investment, independent of the technol-

ogy or market through which it is realized. To
the extent that technologist and investor/manager do not fully trust one another or cannot
communicate effectively, the Darwinian Sea
between invention and innovation becomes
deeper still.
3. Sources of ﬁnancing. Research funds are available (typically from corporate research, government agencies, or more rarely, personal assets)
to support the creation of the idea and the initial
demonstration that it works. Investment funds
can be found to turn an idea into a marketready prototype, supported by a validated
business case. In between, however, there are
typically few sources of funding available to
aspiring innovators seeking to bridge this
‘‘break’’ in funding sources. They include
‘‘angel’’ investors (wealthy individuals, often
personally experienced in creating new companies and/or developing new products); established ﬁrms making equity investments in hightech startups to get a look at emergent
technologies; venture capital ﬁrms specialized
in early stage or ‘‘seed’’ investments; military or
other public procurement; State or Federal
government programs speciﬁcally designed for
the purpose; and university funding from public
or private sources.
4. Enabling infrastructure. Another critical obstacle typically facing champions of early stage
technology development projects is the absence
of necessary infrastructure. By infrastructure we
mean not only the large scale infrastructure
required for ﬁnal products in the marketplace
(e.g., gas stations for internal combustion
automobiles, or software to run on a new
operating system), but also all of the ‘‘complementary assets’’ that may be required for
market acceptance—suppliers of new kinds of
components or materials, new forms of distribution and service, training in the use of the
new technology, auxiliary products and software to broaden market scope.14
Even where a technology has demonstrated
promise to create value for consumers, the
question remains: how much of that value will
the innovative ﬁrm be able to capture? Understanding the mechanism by which value will not
only be created, but captured, is a necessary

<-----Page 4----->Valleys of Death and Darwinian Seas

component of the business system that allows an
invention to become a successful commercial
innovation. Gerald Adolph, a senior vice president
in the technology consulting ﬁrm of Booz Allen &
Hamilton, comments:
We argue that value isn’t created until you get a
business system [model] along with the invention.
The business system is the mechanism by which value
is delivered to someone and captured by someone . . .
focusing on the business system focus allows you to
be more articulate to those who are asking for
funding about the business implications, the success
implications, the competitive implications, without
requiring answer to the other questions that perhaps
no one can answer at those early stages—as in,
exactly how big will it be? How much will I charge for
it? How much money will I make?15

In order to execute the given strategy for value
capture, the ﬁrm in question must have the
internal capabilities and other resources necessary
to leverage its ﬁrst mover advantage into longer
term market success. At every stage, ﬁrms weigh
opportunities for value creation and value capture
against risks and anticipated costs. All things
being equal, a large corporation will develop a
given technology platform ﬁrst in markets where
mechanisms for value capture are better established and production costs are lower.16 In
addition to all the disjunctures between inventor
and investor, there are a daunting set of external
obstacles to realizing a successful venture, difﬁculties that may also be viewed differently by the
various parties involved in the process.

4. An innovation gap?
The multiple challenges that confront technology
entrepreneurs seeking to traverse the ‘‘Darwinian
Sea’’ have led some to argue a persistent ‘‘innovation gap’’ may exist even in the countries with
relatively strong and productive innovation systems.17 Former Undersecretary of Commerce
Mary Good remarked in 1997 that ‘‘as the
competitive pressures of the global marketplace
have forced American ﬁrms to move more of their
R&D into shorter term product and process
improvements, an ‘innovation gap’ has developed. . . . Sit down with a group of venture

231

capitalists. The funding for higher risk ventures . . .
is extraordinarily difﬁcult to come by.’’18
The existence of the sort of ‘‘innovation gap’’
postulated by former Undersecretary Good and
others19 is controversial. Skeptics point out that
the part of the ﬁnancial system specialized in
investing in high risk new enterprises—the venture
capital industry—grew dramatically in the last
decade, even when the downturn beginning in
March 2001 is taken into consideration. Venture
capital funds disbursed to ﬁrms reached a peak of
over $100 billion in the year 2000, before dropping
off to $37 billion in 2001. Interpretations vary. The
White House has recently justiﬁed reductions in
support to the Commerce Department’s ATP with
the statement that ‘‘the overall growth in venture
capital suggests private funding is available for
high-technology projects.’’ In contrast, technology
business leader Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems
observed in July of 2001 that ‘‘a couple of years
ago, even the bad ideas were getting capital. Now
we have gone too far in the opposite direction,
shutting down investment in good ideas.’’20
Entrepreneurs report a dearth of sources of
funding for technology projects that no longer
count as basic research but are not yet far enough
along to form the basis for a business plan. At the
same time, venture capital ﬁrms and other
investors are sitting on record volumes of undisbursed cash, with over $70 billion currently idling
in funds raised during the boom years.
It is not surprising that technology entrepreneurs experience an apparent shortage of funding
while undisbursed cash sits idle. Whether or not
efﬁcient markets exist on Wall Street may be an
open question. However, efﬁcient markets do not
exist for allocating risk capital to early stage
technology ventures. One often cited reason for
such inefﬁciency concerns fundamental limits on
the ability of investors in early stage technology
ventures to fully appropriate returns from their
investments. We focus on a second reason: serious
inadequacies in information available to both
entrepreneurs and investor.21 Early stage development involves not only high quantiﬁable risks, but
also daunting uncertainties. When the uncertainties are primarily technical, investors are illequipped to quantify them. For new technologies
that have the potential to create new product
categories, market uncertainties are also high and

<-----Page 5----->232

Auerswald and Branscomb

similarly difﬁcult to quantify. The ‘‘due diligence’’
that investors in venture capital funds require of
managing partners and that angel investors require
of themselves is intrinsically difﬁcult—and getting
more so as both technologies and markets become
increasingly complex.
Up to a decade is required for the transition
from invention to innovation. Given technical and
market uncertainties, venture capitalists, angels,
and bankers prefer to wait to see the business case
for a new technology rather than funding speculation. The technical content of the business
proposal must be sufﬁciently well established to
provide reliable estimates of product cost, performance, and reliability in the context of an
identiﬁed market that can be entered in a reasonable length of time. It is the funding of this
technical bridge—from invention to innovation—
that is the basis for the notion of an ‘‘innovation
gap.’’

5. Sources of funding for the invention to innovation
transition
Who funds early stage technology development—
the invention to innovation transition? Our
research over the past two years involving a
combination of data analysis and interviews
indicates that most funding for technology development in the phase between invention and
innovation comes from individual private equity
‘‘angel’’ investors, corporations, and the Federal
Government—not, as widely believed, from venture capitalists.
Some numbers regarding technology entrepreneurship place the role of venture capital in
context. In 1998, for example—probably a more
reliable benchmark of innovation funding activities than 2000 when markets where at their
historic peaks—the Small Business Administration
reports that more than 600,000 new ﬁrms (with
employees) were founded. That year approximately 450,000 individuals described themselves
as technology entrepreneurs.22 About 10% of
those entrepreneurs, involved in approximately
20,000 start up ﬁrms, received roughly $20 billion
in funding from Angel investors.23 In contrast,
only about 300 companies received ‘‘seed stage’’
funding from venture capitalists; slightly more

than a thousand ﬁrms received ﬁrst time venture
funding in all categories.24
Overall, of $266 billion that was spent on
national R&D by various sources in the United
States in 1998, substantially less than 14% ﬂowed
into early stage technology development activities.
The exact ﬁgure is elusive, because public ﬁnancial
reporting is not required for these investments.
Our method of arriving at a reliable estimate was
to create two models based on different interpretations of our ‘‘early stage technology development’’ deﬁnition—one very restrictive (i.e. biased
toward a low estimate) and the other quite
inclusive (i.e. biased toward a high estimate).
With this approach we conclude that between $5
billion (2%) and $36 billion (14%) of overall R&D
spending in 1998 was devoted to early stage
technology development. The balance supported
either basic research or applied research, engineering and testing.
Although the range between our lower and
upper estimates differs by several billions of
dollars, the proportional distribution across the
main sources of funding for early stage technology
development activities is surprisingly similar
regardless of whether we employ restrictive or
inclusive models. Given either model, expenditures
on early stage technology development by angel
investors, the federal government, and large
corporations funding ‘‘out-of-the-core business’’
technology development are comparable in magnitude (see Figure 3). Early stage technology
development funds from each of these sources
greatly exceed those from state programs, university expenditures, and the small part of venture
capital investment that goes to support early stage
technology projects. Notably—even excluding as
we do the impact of government procurement—
the federal role in this process is substantial: in our
estimates roughly 20–25% of the total early stage
technology development comes from federal
sources.
As noted earlier, investments by corporations in
advancing established product and process technologies to better serve existing markets comprise
a dominant source of national R&D spending.
But, as Booz Allen and Hamilton (2002) report,
corporate technology entrepreneurs who create an
innovative idea lying outside their ﬁrm’s core
competence and interest face risks and ﬁnancial

<-----Page 6----->Valleys of Death and Darwinian Seas

criteria.

233

Estimated distribution of ESTD funding, based on narrow (lower estimate) and broader (upper estimate) deﬁnitional

challenges similar to those faced by the CEOs of
newly created ﬁrms. While corporations will
indeed spend lavishly on technological innovations
that support their core businesses, they are systematically disinclined to support technological innovations that challenge existing lines of business,
require a fundamental shift of business model, or
depend on the creation of new complementary
infrastructure.
Venture capital ﬁrms are critical ﬁnancial
intermediaries supporting new high-growth ﬁrms.
Why, then, is the role of the venture capital
industry in funding early stage technology development not dominant? Popular press accounts
notwithstanding, venture capital ﬁrms are not in
the R&D business. Rather, they are in the ﬁnancial
business. Their ﬁduciary responsibility is to earn
maximal returns for their investors. They do this
through a complex set of activities that can be
summarized as buying ﬁrms low and selling them
high. Venture capitalists do indeed back highgrowth, new ventures. In many cases, though not
the majority, they support ﬁrms that are bringing
radical new technologies to market. However, even
when venture capitalists do support technologybased enterprises, they prefer to support ﬁrms that
have at least proceeded beyond the product
development stage, i.e. ﬁrms that have completed
the early stage technology development which is
the focus of this study. As the median size of
venture capital deals has increased and the
pressure to provide attractive returns to investors
in mammoth funds has intensiﬁed, venture capital

has tended increasingly to ﬂow to projects in later
stages of development and to already-proven
technologies. For all of the above reasons, trends
in venture capital disbursements should not be
confused with trends in the funding of early stage
technology development.

6. Institutional evolution
Despite (or in response to) market inefﬁciencies,
many institutional arrangements have developed
for funding early stage technology development.
This suggests that funding mechanisms evolve to
match the incentives and motivations of entrepreneur and investors alike.
Champions of early stage technology projects
make use of a wide variety of funding options to
keep their projects alive. These include not only
successive rounds of equity offerings, but also
contract work, income from licensing patents, the
sale of spin-off ﬁrms, and old-fashioned costcutting. While each of these options has its own
costs and beneﬁts, entrepreneurs do not play
favorites among them when it comes to keeping
their projects moving forward.
In contrast to institutional sources of equity
and debt capital for advancing existing businesses
incrementally, the transition from invention to
innovation is ﬁnanced by a great variety of
mechanisms, with new ones being created every
day: angel networks and funds, angel investments
backed by bank debt, university and corporate

<-----Page 7----->234

Auerswald and Branscomb

equity investments, seed investments by university
and corporate venture capital programs, and
certain experimental R&D programs run by
Federal and State agencies.
A report from the National Commission on
Entrepreneurship (Zacharakis et al., 1999, 33)25
notes that ‘‘the substantial amount of funding
provided through informal channels, orders of
magnitude greater than provided by formal
venture capital investments and heretofore
unknown and unappreciated, suggests some
mechanisms for ﬁlling the gap may have developed
without recognition.’’ Yet the proliferation of
institutional types is as much an indication of the
particular informational challenges and structural
disjunctures that deﬁne the ‘‘innovation gap’’ as it
is one of a resolution to the challenge.

7. Regional and sector concentration of resources
While our research to date has not generally
focused on funding patterns at the regional and
industry sector level, some important trends are
apparent. First, the geographical distribution of
early stage technology development activity mirrors that of innovation-related activity in general.
In particular, early stage technology development
is concentrated in geographical regions that invest
heavily in R&D, possess developed risk-capital
networks and related complementary infrastructure (e.g. specialized law ﬁrms, other suppliers),
and otherwise beneﬁt from strong universityindustry linkages.
Second, angel investors provide the most
signiﬁcant source of early stage technology development funding for individual technology entrepreneurs and small technology startups. Since
angel investors make the vast majority of their
investments close to home, early stage technology
development activities, particularly those of smaller ﬁrms, are likely to be concentrated in regions
with active communities of tech-savvy angels.
Third, although state governments provide a
relatively small portion of total early stage
technology development funding, they play a
critical role in establishing regional environments
that help bridge the invention to innovation gap.
State governments facilitate university-industry
partnerships, leverage Federal academic research

funds by providing both general and targeted
grants, build a technically educated workforce
through support of public colleges and universities, and ease regulatory burdens to create a fertile
ground for technology startups. While Route 128
and Silicon Valley arose with little local or state
level political support (in part because they
developed the needed networks, stimulated by
defense funding, in the 1950s), a number of states
have created many of the environmental features
needed for successful innovation.26
Fourth, we found that inter-industry differences
in R&D investments are related to industry
lifecycles. More mature industries, such as the
automotive, tend to invest a smaller percentage of
R&D into earlier stage technology development
than less mature industries such as biotech. Booz
Allen and Hamilton (2002) estimate overall
corporate spending on early stage technology
development to be approximately $13 billion
annually, or 9% of total corporate R&D spending.
The inter-industry distribution was estimated as
follows: chemicals 33%; biopharmaceutical 13%;
electronics 11%; equipment 10%; telecommunications 10%; basic industries 7%; automotive 3%;
and computer software 0%. Spending thus was
found to differ widely by industry, as well as by
company within speciﬁc industries.
The entrepreneurship challenge involves the
capabilities of the individual innovators who seek
to carry their idea across the Darwinian Sea and
participate in the fruits of a successful innovation.
The rare individual—a talented business leader
with a strong technical background—is able to
bridge the Sea personally. A community with
strong social capital may offer mentors—usually
in the form of angel investors—who have been
successful at commercial innovation and serve
both as mentors to new entrepreneurs and as seed
investors in their ideas.
A key feature of these networks of innovation is
that they are geographically conﬁned to speciﬁc
locations. Angels rarely invest in a ﬁrm more than
an hour’s drive away; a similar effect is found in
seed stage venture ﬁrms.
Attesting to the localized economic development impact of strong university research, more
than 80% of the start-up companies were located
in the academic institution’s home state or
province.27 More than $1.26 billion in royalties

<-----Page 8----->Valleys of Death and Darwinian Seas

were collected by U.S. colleges and universities in
FY 2000. In addition, the FY 2000 Annual
Association of University Technology Managers
(AUTM) Licensing Survey reported 347 new
products were introduced to market and at least
454 spin-off companies were created by these
institutions.28 Universities are not only the source
of many of the commercially attractive technical
discoveries; they constitute a web of capabilities—
technical, legal, business management, and application skills that form the core of the social capital
in areas like Silicon Valley, California, and Route
128, Boston.
The geographical and sectoral concentrations
just summarized create additional challenges to
champions of early stage technology development
projects located outside of favored geographical or
market spaces. Such challenges may be of considerable importance to public policy. The implications for public policy will depend heavily on
whether the Federal government attempts to
compensate for such tendencies toward concentration, or rather to accept them as reﬂecting the ﬂow
of resources to geographical and market areas in
which expected economic returns are highest.

8. Implications for policy design and
implementation: Lessons from the experience of
the ATP30
In 1990 Congress created the ATP within the
National Institute of Standards and Technology of
the U.S. Department of Commerce. The program’s mission is to ‘‘assist United States businesses in creating and applying generic technology
and research results necessary to: (1) commercialize signiﬁcant new scientiﬁc discoveries and
technologies rapidly; and (2) reﬁne manufacturing
technologies . . . giving preference to technologies
that have great economic potential.’’31 Industry
proposes research projects to ATP; projects are
selected for funding based on both their technical
and their economic and business merit.
ATP is designed to function as a form of publicprivate partnership, in which a government
agency, NIST, promotes economic growth by
sharing with industry the cost of early stage
research in new or existing ﬁrms (Hill, 1998,
pp. 143-173). ATP research is intended to develop

235

innovative technologies that, despite being high in
technical risk, are ‘‘enabling’’ in the sense of
having the potential to provide signiﬁcant, broadbased beneﬁts.
The ATP program was accessible from the
beginning to both individual ﬁrms and consortia
of ﬁrms eager to share a new technology if it could
be made practical. In 1993 the Clinton administration introduced an innovation: ATP would
invite industries to propose ‘‘focus areas’’ for
ATP investment. The idea was to produce more
measurable economic effects and encourage technology diffusion by concentrating $30 to 40
million in each of several industrial technology
areas. The grants themselves could be to individual
ﬁrms or to groups of ﬁrms, but all would be aware
of the common target area for research. This
approach seemed attractive to most observers, but
was terminated by the 105th Congress.
The role of universities in ATP is deﬁned in the
statute. Universities can participate in the consortia of ﬁrms proposing projects to ATP, but they
cannot serve as the project leader (prime contractor). Thus, while a signiﬁcant fraction of ATP
funding ﬂows to university laboratories acting as
subcontractors of the ﬁrms, in many cases the
experts in the universities have also served as
advisors to the ﬁrms creating the proposal, thus
strongly inﬂuencing the technical goals and
strategies. Universities have often sought the
opportunity to act as the initiators of ATP group
projects, however this would require a change in
the legislation.
A recent report from the Secretary of Commerce defends the ATP program as a useful policy
tool for encouraging innovation and recommends
a series of six reforms in the program.32 Two of
these would give universities patent rights in
projects carried out in partnership with ﬁrms and
would allow universities to initiate and lead joint
projects with ﬁrms. Another emphasizes that ATP
should be viewed—and managed—as an R&D
program, avoiding ‘‘down stream’’ investments in
product development. Large ﬁrms would be
allowed to participate only in consortia, and
ATP would improve its access to expert advice.
The most controversial ‘‘reform’’ would be a
change in the law allowing ATP to recapture a
5% royalty on commercially successful projects.
This is unlikely to be accepted by the Congress,

<-----Page 9----->236

Auerswald and Branscomb

and in any case seems to be philosophically
incompatible with the notion that ATP does not
fund product development, making the association
of earnings within ATP projects difﬁcult to
establish. It also would appear to provide an
incentive for ATP managers that is perverse with
respect to the desire to keep the program focused
on high-risk, early stage research.
Thus the direction of policy is likely to continue
to be rooted in research funding policy, but to
allow government agencies to invest further downstream than is traditional for government basic
research funding. The application of peer review
processes to this kind of work would appear to
offer a serious challenge, perhaps explaining why
the Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
which does not use peer review, is more comfortable with funding advanced technologies of
industrial value than is the National Science
Foundation.

9. Conclusion
The challenges faced today by those involved in
crafting and implementing science and technology
policy at the Federal level parallel those faced by
the leading technology corporations in the United
States in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. These large
companies generated many basic science breakthroughs in noted research facilities such as Bell
Labs and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
(PARC). Yet, in many well documented and
widely discussed cases, these companies missed
signiﬁcant opportunities to turn inventions into
proﬁtable innovations. What is worse—in many
cases the companies lost not only the inventions,
but the inventors, as a result of inadequate support
for the invention to innovation transition. The
founder of Intel, Gordon Moore (noted also as the
originator of ‘‘Moore’s Law’’) observed in 2001 at
a conference at Stanford University: ‘‘In a pattern
that clearly carries over to other technological
ventures, we found at Fairchild that any company
active on the forefront of semiconductor technology uncovers far more opportunities than it is in a
position to pursue. And when people are enthusiastic about a particular opportunity but are not
allowed to pursue it, they become potential
entrepreneurs. As we have seen over the past few

years, when these potential entrepreneurs are
backed by a plentiful source of venture capital
there is a burst of new enterprise.’’33
How much innovation is the right amount in a
large corporation? A region? A nation? In every
case, some ‘‘spillovers’’ or ‘‘leakage’’ occur of
ideas, people, projects. Moore continues: ‘‘One of
the reasons Intel has been so successful is that we
have tried to eliminate unnecessary R&D, thus
maximizing our R&D yield and minimizing costly
spin-offs. But successful start-ups almost always
begin with an idea that has ripened in the research
organization of a large company (or university).
Any region without larger companies at the
technology frontier or research organizations of
large companies will probably have fewer companies starting or spinning off.’’ A similar tension
faces regions and nations as they struggle to
encourage the ‘‘horizontal’’ connections between
researchers to spur invention, at the same that they
encourage ‘‘vertical’’ connections between technologists and business executives in achieving the
invention to innovation transition. In his Industrial Research Institute Medalist’s Address provocatively titled ‘‘The Customer for R&D is Always
Wrong!’’, Robert Frosch (former head of research
at General Motors and Administrator of NASA,
among other distinctions), offered the following
observation:
There is a kind of Heisenberg uncertainty principle
about the coordination connections that are necessary in R&D.’’ One needs all of these deep
connections among kinds of knowledge, and the
ability to think about the future, that works best in
an institution that puts all those people together. One
also needs connection with the day-to-day, market
thinking, and the future thinking of the operating
side of the business, which suggests to many that the
R&D people should be sitting on the operating side
of the business.
This is an insoluble problem; there is no organizational system that will capture perfectly both sets of
coordination . . . There is no perfect organization
that will solve this problem—the struggle is inevitable.

Neither the United States, nor its venture capital
ﬁrms, nor its large corporations, have arrived at
the perfect organizational structure to manage
innovation. To our knowledge, no such perfect
organization exists elsewhere. If Frosch is correct

<-----Page 10----->Valleys of Death and Darwinian Seas

(and we think he is), even in theory, fundamental
contradictions inherent in the ‘‘planning of innovation’’ suggest that it is misguided to aspire
toward elegance, symmetry, and efﬁciency in this
context. In the Darwinian Sea, the struggle is
inevitable—not just the struggle between aspiring
technologies and their champions, but also the
struggle between institutional forms and
approaches to the management of innovation.
The chaotic character of the Darwinian Sea is
probably necessary to provide a wide range of
alternative ways to address issues of technical risk,
to identify markets that do not yet exist, to match
up people and money from disparate sources. But
on one bank of the Sea—the S&T enterprise,
technology ‘‘push’’ policies may encourage agencies to fund research closer to the reduction to
practice required for a solid business case. And on
the other back—the world of business and
ﬁnance—technology ‘‘pull’’ policies will continue
to enhance the incentives for risk taking (for
example through moderated capital gains tax
rates). Programs like the ATP, which has elements
of both push and pull, may continue to be viewed
as experimental, but will become more securely
anchored on the research shore of the Sea if they
are to maintain effectiveness at the same time that
they secure lasting public and political support.

4. We use ‘‘invention’’ as shorthand for a commercially
promising product or service idea, based on new science or
technology that is protectable, but not necessarily by patents or
copyrights. By ‘‘innovation’’ we mean successful entry into a
market of a new, science or technology-based product, which
we call an ‘‘invention.’’ By ESTD we mean the technical and
business activities that transform a commercially promising
‘‘invention’’ into a business plan that can attract enough
investment to enter a market successfully, and through that
investment become a successful innovation. This requires
reducing the needed technology to practice, deﬁning a production process with predictable product costs and relating the
resultant product speciﬁcations to a deﬁned market.

7. This idea was articulated in Vannevar Bush’s Science the
Endless Frontier published in 1945 as a report to President
Truman. In return for generous public investments in research,
scientists committed to a highly creative, competitive, and
honest performance.
8. Our use of the phrases ‘‘technology push’’ and ‘‘technology pull’’ is idiosyncratic, and not intended to parallel the terms
‘‘supply push’’ and ‘‘demand pull’’ as widely employed in the
literature on induced innovation. In the context of that,
complementary, literature, both sets of statutes to which we
refer would be considered ‘‘supply push’’ policies. See also
Ruttan (2000).
9. The ATP is managed by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce. ATP funded the two-year research project by the
authors on the process of early stage technology development,
upon which this paper is largely based.
10. An innovation is a product or process, new to the
enterprise, that is successfully introduced into commerce. The
adjective ‘‘innovative’’ simply means clever, novel, and perhaps
commercially promising. An innovative idea is not an innovation, at least not until it is successfully produced and sold.
11. The literature on technology management contains many
variants on this diagram. A good example is that developed in
parallel to our own by Lane (1999). Formal models involving
staged technology development include Aghion et al. (2002) and
Judd (2002).
12. Reporting on their interviews of corporate technology
managers and venture capitalists, the team from Booz Allen
Hamilton emphasized the importance of interpreting the
framework presented in Figure 1 as a sequence of idealized
stages potentially linked in complex ways: ‘‘Most interviewees
generally agreed with the classiﬁcation of R&D into the four
steps in the innovation framework used in our discussions
(Basic, Concept/Invention, ESTD, Product Development).
However, there were many reactions to the linear simplicity
of the framework, compared to the typical path from invention
to commercial innovation that the participants have experienced.’’
13. Entrepreneurs in many settings also report a particular
difﬁculty in raising funds in the range of $200,000 to $2 million.
The hypothesis of such a ‘‘capital gap’’ in seed stage funding for
new ventures is discussed by Sohl (1999), and consistently
supported by practitioners (see, for example, comments by
participants at a Senate Small Business Committee Forum,
<www.senate.gov/sbc/hearings/internet.html>. The hypothesis is not restricted to the United States. In 1999 the U.K.
Department of Trade and Industry published a report titled
‘‘Addressing the SME [small and medium enterprise] Equity
Gap.’’ At a recent National Science Foundation sponsored
conference, Jian Gao of Tsinghua University (Beijing, PRC)
reported that an analogous ‘‘capital gap’’ phenomenon has
been observed to exist in China. See also Preston (1993) and
Chertow (2001).

rather than a shortfall of resources. Arrow (1962) and

Zeckhauser (1996) set forth the theoretical basis for this point
of view. Auerswald and Branscomb (2002) elaborate.
18. Testimony before the U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee. Quoted in Gompers and Lerner (1999, p. 2). These
authors quite accurately point out an apparent contradiction in
the quote from Dr. Good, which appears in its edited form to
suggest that venture capitalists are reluctant to provide risk
capital. Of course, this is not the case. As Gompers and Lerner
(1999) describe, the venture capital mode of ﬁnance is precisely
that which is specialized in providing ﬁnance in contexts where
uncertainty is high and information asymmetries severe. At the
same time, however, as Morgenthaler (2000) and other venture
capitalists report, the risk/reward ratio for seed stage,
technology based ventures is not as attractive to venture capital
ﬁrms as that for slightly later stage ventures. For further
discussion see Branscomb and Auerswald (2002).

were granted to companies with fewer than 500 employees.
Start-up businesses were launched to commercialize 626 of the
licenses. New licenses rose 11% over 1999 survey results.
Invention disclosures rose 6% from 1999 to a FY 2000 total of
13,032. Patent applications grew by 15% from the 1999 total of
5,545 to 6,375 in FY 2000. Patents issued rose 3% in FY 2000 to
3,764. FY 2002 saw academic institutions taking an equity
interest in 372 deals, 53% more than the previous year. The
institutions held equity interest in 56% of the 454 spin-offs
created in FY 2000. Over the ten years AUTM has conducted
the survey, nearly 3,400 new businesses have been launched
from academic research results. One hundred eighty-four
institutions reported 2,309 start-ups were still independent,
operating businesses at the end of 2000. The number of license/
