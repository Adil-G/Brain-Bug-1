Abstract
While bootstrapping is widely utilized as a strategic practice of small firms and has been
regarded in the entrepreneurship literature as an important topic of study, little has been done to
link bootstrapping to organizational theory. This paper presents hypotheses and an empirical
study regarding bootstrapping and organizational development for small firms. The results of the
study indicate that different types of bootstrapping are utilized at different periods in the life of a
small firm, and that the methods utilized coincide to some extent with organizational theory
predictions.

1. Executive summary
It has been well documented that small firms face constraints in obtaining financing
from traditional outside parties due to information asymmetries and transaction costs.
From research and anecdotal evidence, we know that small firms respond to these
constraints via bootstrapping, or finding creative ways to avoid the need for external
financing through reducing overall cost of operation, improving cash flow, or using

financial sources internal to the company. Yet, despite our knowledge of its widespread use
and its importance for small firm survival and growth, little academic work in
entrepreneurship has focused on developing of an understanding of bootstrapping and
how it relates to small firm development.
In one of the few empirical studies on bootstrapping to date, Winborg and Landstrom
(2001) performed exploratory research into the bootstrapping methods used by Swedish
firms, identifying 25 specific techniques that could be grouped into six categories of
bootstrapping. The study documented in this paper builds on these researchers’ findings
and attempts to link bootstrapping to organizational theory and firm development.
Propositions were developed and tested regarding how the use of four types of
bootstrapping methods identified by Winborg and Landstrom (customer-related, delaying-payments, owner-related, and joint-utilization techniques) change in small firms over
time. The empirical analysis involved sixty-two small retail and eighty-four small service
firms located in the Midwestern United States. Firm owners responded to survey questions
regarding bootstrapping techniques used early in the life of the firm and those techniques
that are currently used. The responses largely coincide with resource dependence theory, in
that the use of owner-related and joint-utilization techniques significantly decreased over
time, while the use of customer-related bootstrapping techniques significantly increased.
However, contrary to predictions, the use of delaying-payments techniques significantly
decreased over time.
This line of research is important to academics and practitioners alike, as it contributes
to our understanding of the use of bootstrapping in small firms. The empirical findings
from this study offer promise that bootstrapping can in fact be linked to organizational
theory and provide a basis for future research in this area. Future research can build on this
study to investigate bootstrapping as related to organizational life cycles and gain a better
understanding of why certain bootstrapping methods are more prevalent than others.
For entrepreneurship practitioners, this study provides some direction as to where to
look internally for financial resources and for questioning how and why the use of
bootstrapping changes over time. For instance, if internal sources of financing are less
expensive than external, practitioners should consider whether it is in the firm’s best
interest to decrease levels of bootstrapping as the firm evolves, as seems to be the general
practice with three of the four methods investigated. Since obtaining resources
inexpensively is critical for small firm survival and growth, it is important for practitioners
to develop bootstrapping strategies that correspond with firm development.

2. Introduction
Small firm financing has long been of interest to entrepreneurship researchers. Along
with the establishment of how important small business is to the economy in terms of job
and wealth creation (e.g., Romano et al., 2001; Sherman, 1999; Storey, 1994), it has also
been well documented that financing is a factor in new and small firm survival and growth
(e.g., Cassar, 2004; Davila et al., 2003; Cooper et al., 1994) and that these firms face
challenges in obtaining financing (e.g., Rajan and Zingales, 1995; Holtz-Eakin et al.,
1994). This evidence has led to an urgency to understand the financial constraints that

<-----Page 2----->J. Ebben, A. Johnson / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 851–865

853

entrepreneurs face and how they respond to those constraints, an understanding that will
further the field of entrepreneurship research and the prescriptive literature on small firm
financing. Yet, despite the array of research that has been performed in this area, it is
widely agreed that a lack of understanding still exists (e.g., Cassar, 2004; Romano et al.,
2001).
One area that has begun to merit more attention is that of bootstrapping, or methods that
are used to reduce firm reliance on outside financing. Since outside financing in the forms
of debt and equity are difficult to obtain (e.g., Van Auken and Neeley, 1996; Chaganti et
al., 1995) and are more costly than internal sources of financing (e.g., Cassar, 2004;
Carpenter and Petersen, 2002; Holmes and Dunstan, 1994), bootstrapping is both
necessary and desirable for many small firms. While bootstrapping has been discussed
extensively in the popular press (e.g., Harnish, 2002; Gendron, 1999), it does not widely
appear in the academic literature in the form of prescriptive work, theoretical development,
qualitative studies, or empirical analyses (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001).
In one of the more comprehensive studies on bootstrapping to date, Winborg and
Landstrom (2001) identified bootstrapping techniques commonly used by small firms
through an exploratory qualitative and quantitative analysis. Other researchers have
examined the extent to which bootstrapping is used in small firms, finding that the
majority of small firms utilize some form of bootstrapping to both initially finance and
grow their operations (Harrison and Mason, 1997; Bhide, 1992). However, there is little
understanding to date regarding how bootstrapping techniques relate to or impact
organizational development. This study advances the entrepreneurship literature by
applying organizational theory to bootstrapping in small firms and empirically testing
hypotheses regarding bootstrapping and organizational development. The findings indicate
that organizational theory may be used to predict bootstrapping behavior and provide some
new insight into the role of bootstrapping in small firms.

3. Literature review and hypotheses
3.1. Bootstrapping and capital constraints
Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some
recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside
debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom,
2001; Harrison and Mason, 1997). By this definition, bootstrapping includes a
combination of methods that reduce overall capital requirements, improve cash flow,
and take advantage of personal sources of financing. Bootstrapping in this manner has
long been considered a necessary response to the financial constraints that small firms face
(Winborg and Landstrom, 2001; Van Auken and Neeley, 1996), which are generally due to
information asymmetries and transaction costs (Cassar, 2004; Watson and Wilson, 2002).
Information asymmetries are higher in small firms due to lack of available public
information (Carpenter and Petersen, 2002), which leads sources of financing to view
small firms as risky investments and to only offer limited amounts of financing at a higher
price (Shane and Cable, 2002). In terms of transaction costs, it is more costly in relative

<-----Page 3----->854

J. Ebben, A. Johnson / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 851–865

terms for providers of financing to make small loans or investments and this cost is passed
on to the business.
Much of the entrepreneurship, finance, and economics literature on small firm finance
has examined these capital constraints, finding that it is difficult and expensive for small
firms to raise outside capital from banks and investors (e.g., Berger and Udell, 1995; Rajan
and Zingales, 1995; Storey, 1994; Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981). For instance, banks partake in
credit rationing with small firms (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981), in which they bnot only
demand a risk premium in the form of higher interest, they limit credit facilities or refuse
to grant the loanQ (Egeln et al., 1997, p. 138). Empirical evidence supports this notion, with
studies finding that smaller and younger firms more often encounter liquidity constraints
from lack of outside financing (Egeln et al., 1997) and that smaller and younger firms are
less likely to receive bank financing (Levenson and Willard, 2000).
Because of the difficulty and expense associated with obtaining outside debt and equity
capital, it is both necessary and desirable for small firms to bootstrap. This coincides with
the pecking order model of finance, which states that it is more desirable for firms to look
to internal methods of finance before seeking outside debt and equity (Myers, 1984). In
related studies, Watson and Wilson (2002) found through empirical analysis that the
pecking order model was bparticularly strong in relation to the closely held firms where
information asymmetries. . .would be most apparentQ (p. 576), while Norton (1991) found
that small, high-growth firms generally followed the pecking order in financing firm
needs. Additionally, Carpenter and Petersen (2002) found that the typical small firm in
their study retained all of its earnings and raised little outside financing.
To avoid outside financing, it is expected that small firms proactively use bootstrapping
techniques. To investigate this, Winborg and Landstrom (2001) studied the bootstrapping
methods used by a sample of small Swedish firms. Through qualitative analysis, they
identified thirty-two commonly used techniques that were then tested empirically in a
sample of 262 firms. From the empirical testing, the thirty-two bootstrapping techniques
were further narrowed to 25 relevant techniques, which were grouped into six
classifications of bootstrapping methods: (1) owner-provided financing and resources,
(2) accounts receivable management methods, (3) sharing or borrowing of resources from
other firms, (4) delaying payments, (5) minimization of resources invested in stock
through formal routines, and (6) use of government subsidies. Further analysis was
performed to identify general characteristics of firms that utilized the different
classifications of methods.
Apart from the Winborg and Landstrom (2001) study, little of the finance work in the
entrepreneurship literature directly deals with bootstrapping. However, the work that has
been done to date, including the Winborg and Landstrom (2001) study, has shown
bootstrapping to be a vital part of small firm finance, finding that as many as 80–95% of
small firms utilize some form of bootstrapping (Harrison and Mason, 1997; Bhide, 1992).
Because of its prevalence in small firms and the lack of research on the topic,
bootstrapping is considered to be one of the areas of entrepreneurship research that most
need to be addressed (Brophy, 1997).
The importance of continued research in this area stems from the evidence that lack
of capital puts small firms at risk of failure and limits the potential for growth (e.g.,
Chaganti et al., 1995). For instance, Bechetti and Trovato (2002) found that lack of

<-----Page 4----->J. Ebben, A. Johnson / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 851–865

855

available external financing constrained small firm growth, Davila et al. (2003)
concluded that start-ups may have to delay growth due to lack of timely funds, and
Cooper et al. (1994) found that initial financial capital significantly impacted subsequent
survival and growth of new firms. Expensive debt financing also puts small firms at a
disadvantage because it puts a greater strain on much-needed cash flow through higher
interest payments.
3.2. Bootstrapping and organizational development
To date, organizational theory has not been applied to bootstrapping in small firms and
how it relates to the development of the organization. Traditionally, experts have viewed
bootstrapping as a response to the capital constraints small firms face (Winborg and
Landstrom, 2001; Van Auken and Neeley, 1996); in other words, because of capital
constraints, small firms are forced to utilize bootstrapping methods as a means of survival.
Yet, these capital constraints are likely to change over time (Van Auken and Holman,
1995) and it is unclear how firms respond in terms of their bootstrapping behavior.
The traditional view of bootstrapping coincides with resource dependence theory
(Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Resource dependence theory assumes that firms do not
possess all of the resources they need and must therefore obtain resources from external
parties. When firms are faced with situations in which they have little leverage in obtaining
necessary resources, they respond by acting in a strategic manner that decreases their
dependence on others for those resources. By changing these dependent relationships,
firms can improve their chances of survival and success by limiting relationships where
they have little leverage. Research has found the existence of this type of response to the
environment in many types of organizations (e.g., Pfeffer and Salancik, 1974).
As small firms develop, dependencies will change as they gain leverage with outside
parties and obtain legitimacy with their operations. This is consistent with the liability of
newness perspective (Stinchcombe, 1965), in which it is expected that due to lack of
established reputation, operating experience, and other aspects, new firms will be more at
the mercy of outside parties than more established firms. As small firms become more
established, leverage with banks, investors, customers, and suppliers may change the types
of bootstrapping techniques that are available and desirable.
3.3. Expected changes in bootstrapping techniques
From Winborg and Landstrom’s (2001) findings, different classifications of bootstrapping methods can be identified. Based on their findings, there are at least four types of
methods that can be used to bootstrap small firms: (1) customer-related methods, (2)
delaying payments, (3) owner-related financing and resources, and (4) joint-utilization of
resources with other firms. Customer-related bootstrapping includes methods that improve
cash flow from customers, such as obtaining advance payments, charging interest on
overdue invoices, or ceasing relations with late-paying customers. Delaying payments
includes methods that improve cash flow by making payments at a later date, such as
negotiating longer terms with suppliers or leasing equipment rather than purchasing.
Owner-related bootstrapping includes methods such as money supplied from the owner’s

<-----Page 5----->856

J. Ebben, A. Johnson / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 851–865

savings, personal loans taken by the owner, or loans from the owner’s family and friends.
Joint-utilization of resources involves such actions as sharing employees, assets or
business space with other firms, or coordinating purchases with other firms to take
advantage of economies of scale.
3.3.1. Customer-based and delaying-payments methods
From resource dependence theory, it could be expected that customer-based and
delaying-payments bootstrapping methods would increase over time. For instance, as a
firm becomes more important to its customers and suppliers, it gains leverage in those
relationships with which to negotiate payment terms. Additionally, it may learn to cope
with customer and supplier constraints by implementing systems that speed up billing, that
provide incentives for upfront or earlier payments, or that pay bills closer to when they
come due.
The literature supports this in terms of customer-based bootstrapping, or receivables,
writing that ba major purpose of trade credit is to provide product quality guaranteesQ
(Long et al., 1993, p. 118) and that trade credit can be used as a means to establish
reputation (Ng et al., 1999; Smith, 1987). Early on, as firms have yet to develop a
reputation or to convince customers of product or service quality, it will be difficult to get
customers to pay before they are satisfied with their purchases. As a firm’s reputation
develops, customers should be more comfortable with shorter payment terms or other
stipulations such as interest on late payments. Long et al. (1993) found evidence to support
this theory, concluding that smaller firms with less-established reputations tend to offer
relatively more credit than larger firms with more established reputations. Therefore, small
firms should be forced into providing credit terms early on, but this should decrease over
time as customer relationships and firm reputation develop.
A similar stance has been taken in the literature with delaying-payments methods,
particularly those related to supplier credit. Early on, when firms have little credit history
with payables, the threat of payment default is higher and it is likely to be more difficult to
obtain supplier credit (Aaronson et al., 2004; Vandenberg, 2003; Ng et al., 1999). These
firms are often faced with either paying early or facing an interest penalty, with little room
to negotiate terms (Ng et al., 1999). Aaronson et al. (2004) found evidence in small firms
to support this, with trade credit more likely to be offered as supplier relationships are
further developed. Vandenberg (2003) also found some support for this theory, reporting
evidence of a positive relationship between access to trade credit and firm size. Therefore,
small firms should be able to lean on suppliers for more financing as relationships and
credit history develop over time.
3.3.2. Owner-related methods
Researchers have generally found that outside sources of financing become more
available to small firms over time. For instance, it has been found that borrowers with
longer banking relationships receive lower interest rates and are less likely to pledge
collateral (Berger and Udell, 1995), that firms that receive bank financing are older and
larger than those that do not (Levenson and Willard, 2000), and that firms are more likely
to receive outside investments as they obtain closer ties to investors (Shane and Cable,
2002).

<-----Page 6----->J. Ebben, A. Johnson / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 851–865

857

If small firms are able to gain access to additional sources of financing over time (i.e.,
customers, suppliers, banks, and investors), it should follow that the use of owner-related
bootstrapping techniques should decrease. Much of the early entrepreneurship literature
focused on personal traits of the entrepreneur, with many of these concluding that
entrepreneurs are not risk takers (e.g., Cooper et al., 1988; Brockhaus, 1980). From this
perspective, it is unlikely that small business owners would place their personal wealth at
risk via credit card debt or foregone salary when other financing is available. The same is
likely to be true regarding money and other resources obtained from the owner’s family
and friends, as owners should want to decrease the risk involved for these parties over
time.
3.3.3. Joint-utilization methods
Resource dependence theory would also predict that joint-utilization bootstrapping
techniques should decrease over time, as these are thought to be both a response to
resource constraints and a way to obtain legitimacy (Vandenberg, 2003; Winborg and
Landstrom, 2001). For instance, joint utilization of equipment is a way to obtain access
to an asset without realizing the asset’s full cost, as well as a way to establish
credibility via having access to the asset and having a relationship with a partner firm.
According to resource dependence theory, as small firms establish their reputations and
gain access to additional sources of financing, they should opt to become less
dependent on other firms for shared resources. Empirical evidence demonstrates this
notion as Vandenberg (2003) found that the practice of buying supplies in collaboration
with other small firms to take advantage of bulk purchasing discounts was inversely
related to firm size.
Proposition 1. The extent to which bootstrapping is utilized by small firms changes over
time, and the direction of change depends on the type of bootstrapping method.
Specifically, in small firms:
Proposition 1a. Use of customer-related bootstrapping increases over time.
Proposition 1b. Use of delaying-payments bootstrapping increases over time.
Proposition 1c. Use of owner-related bootstrapping decreases over time.
Proposition 1d. Use of joint-utilization bootstrapping decreases over time.
4. Methods
4.1. Sample
The sample for this study was selected from a university-owned database of retail and
service firms in the Midwestern United States. A survey based on bootstrapping
techniques identified by Winborg and Landstrom (2001) was sent to the firms in this
database, and 183 firms responded to the survey for a response rate of 28%. Firms that
were less than 2 years old were eliminated from the sample to provide time for changes in
bootstrapping use to occur, and firms that were greater than 40 years old were eliminated

to help control issues with recalling early bootstrapping use and with potential systematic
bootstrapping differences in earlier eras. After these firms were eliminated and after data
cleaning, there were 146 usable firms for analysis, which included sixty-two retail firms
and eighty-four service firms. Mean firm age for the sample was 13.99 years, with a
minimum of 2 years and maximum of 37 years, and the mean number of employees was
17.80, with a minimum of one employee and maximum of eighty-five (see Table 1). All
firms in the sample fit the criteria of a small firm by most accepted definitions involving
number of employees (e.g., SBA, 2004).
4.2. Constructs
4.2.1. Independent construct
The independent construct for this study is time, as the study investigates whether and
in which direction bootstrapping techniques change over time. This construct was captured
via survey by asking respondents to indicate the level of bootstrapping use bearly in the
life of the firmQ versus the level of bootstrapping bcurrently usedQ.
4.2.2. Dependent construct
The dependent construct for the study was the change in the level of bootstrapping use.
This was also captured via survey regarding twenty-five common bootstrapping methods
identified by Winborg and Landstrom (2001). Survey respondents were asked to indicate
on a five-point Likert scale the degree to which they used each technique early in the life
of the firm and the degree to which each technique is currently used. The Likert scale
ranged from 1 (Not at All) to 5 (Very High Use).

5. Analysis and results
To verify Winborg and Landstrom’s (2001) grouping of bootstrapping methods into the
four categories related to the propositions in this paper (customer-related, delaying
payments, owner-related, and joint-utilization), a principle components analysis with
Varimax rotation was performed on the survey responses to bootstrapping use for the

twenty-five methods (see Table 2). Evidence from the eigenvalues and scree plot indicate
that three factors are appropriate, with the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure and Bartlett’s Test
of Sphericity supporting this solution. The main difference between our findings and those
from Winborg and Landstrom (2001) is that owner-related methods and delaying
payments methods loaded on a single factor, while joint-utilization methods and
customer-related methods loaded on separate factors. The first factor could be identified
as bquickQ methods for bootstrapping (since the owner can put in personal cash or decide
to delay a payment without spending much time on it), while the second and third could be
identified as relationship methods with business partners and customers, respectively. Five
of the twenty-five methods were eliminated due to low communalities (less than 2.0) or
lack of apparent fit with any of the three factors: coordinating purchases, using a factor,
running the business out of the home, buying on consignment, and hiring family and
friends at below-market wages. Running the business out of the home and buying on
consignment were also eliminated in Winborg and Landstrom’s (2001) analysis due to low
communalities.
The methods from the first factor involving owner-related financing were separated
from those involving delaying payments to test the propositions. This resulted in six
methods for customer-related bootstrapping, five methods for delaying-payments bootstrapping, four methods for owner-related bootstrapping, and five methods for jointutilization bootstrapping (see Table 3). Evidence from the data analysis provides support

for Propositions 1a, 1c, and 1d, but not for Proposition 1b. Looking at the overall use of
each type of bootstrapping, paired-sample t-tests revealed a significant increase in
customer-related methods and significant decreases in delaying-payments methods,
owner-related methods, and joint-utilization methods. Looking at individual techniques,
paired-sample t-tests showed significant increases in the use of three of the six customerrelated techniques, significant decreases in four of the five delaying-payments techniques,
significant decreases in all four owner-related techniques, and significant decreases in all
five joint-utilization techniques.
To take a closer look at the trend of change, firms that used each technique early on
were separated from those that did not. This analysis revealed that firms that did not use
a particular technique early on were unlikely to be using that technique currently
(although it is unclear from the study whether these techniques were not used because
they were unavailable to the firm, not recognized as an available technique, or for some
other reason). It also appears that firms that did use a particular technique early on were
unlikely to change their level of use of that technique over time. For instance, 74.8% of
firms in the sample did not use interest on overdue payments early on and only 4.5% of
these began using this technique later; of the 25.2% that did use this technique early on,
73.0% maintained their same level of use over time. This indicates that for most of the
twenty individual techniques, firms did not change their level of use, contrary to
Proposition 1.
However, at the type-of-method level, this analysis also revealed that the vast
majority of firms did in fact use all four types of bootstrapping (customer-related,
delaying-payments, owner-related, and joint-utilization) to some extent early on and
most changed their use of these over time. 93.9% of firms indicated some use of
customer-related bootstrapping methods early on, with 38.4% of these increasing use
and only 22.5% decreasing use over time (39.1% remained the same); 96.6% of firms
indicated some use of delaying-payments methods early on, with 55.6% of these
decreasing use and 15.5% increasing use over time (28.9% remained the same); 93.8%
of firms indicated some use of owner-related methods early on, with 65.0% of these
decreasing use and 8.0% increasing use over time (27.0% remained the same); and
75.5% of firms indicated some use of joint-utilization methods early on, with 47.2% of
these decreasing use and 19.4% increasing use over time (33.3% remained the same).
These results indicate that small firms are generally using the four types of techniques
early on, are generally changing their level of use of these techniques over time, and are
generally changing their level of use in the expected direction (with the exception of
delaying payments, which is in the opposite direction), providing support for
Propositions 1a, 1c, and 1d.

6. Conclusions
6.1. Implications and future research
As one of the first empirical investigations into bootstrapping in small firms, this study
shows promise for future empirical work in this area to aid in theoretical and practical

<-----Page 11----->862

J. Ebben, A. Johnson / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 851–865

understanding of how bootstrapping is utilized in new and small firms. While this study
does not clear up all of the questions about the nature of bootstrapping, it does indicate that
organizational theory may play an important role in the bootstrapping techniques used.
Specifically, certain techniques utilized may change with the development of the
organization according to resource dependence theory.
The results of this study indicate that firms are using the four types of bootstrapping
analyzed and are changing their level of these types of bootstrapping over time. It also
appears that the direction of change depends on the type of bootstrapping technique in
question. As predicted, it appears that the amount of owner-related and joint-utilization
bootstrapping decreases over time. These findings would seem to agree with theories
regarding entrepreneurial risk-taking and organizational legitimacy (e.g., Cooper et al.,
1988; Stinchcombe, 1965), in that small business owners rely on less personal
financing as other sources of financing become available to the firm, and on less jointutilization of resources as they obtain legitimacy. Also, as predicted, the results show
that firms generally increase use of customer-related techniques over time. This would
seem to coincide with both resource dependence and organizational learning, in that
firms may gain leverage with customers or learn ways to obtain payments earlier,
perhaps by seeking out larger orders from customers for which they can require
upfront payments.
However, opposite of predictions, the analysis indicates that the use of delayingpayments bootstrapping decreases, which does not seem to fit with organizational theory.
This decrease could be a result of small firms attempting to become better customers to
their suppliers, as they may find that getting on-time, quality supply is more important to
cost and cash flow in the long run than getting the best possible payment terms. If this
speculation were true, resource dependence may indeed play a role in the evolution of
these bootstrapping techniques in small firms. To develop a better understanding, this
should be considered in future research.
The results of this study also raise some questions regarding bootstrapping techniques
that are used early on versus those that are not. In particular, it appears that small firms
are more likely to use certain techniques early on than others (such as buying used
equipment versus sharing equipment) and that they are unlikely to start using techniques
that they did not use early on. It is possible that some techniques not used are just not
available to the firm, due to the type of business model, customers, or suppliers. But it is
also possible that owners are simply unaware of certain techniques and future research in
this area could aid educators and consultants in defining areas where awareness should
be raised.
Finally, future research on bootstrapping should look into the impact of individual
characteristics of entrepreneurs on the bootstrapping techniques they utilize. Researchers have found that different types of entrepreneurs set up different types of
organizations, with different goals, structures, and management (e.g., Cooper and
Dunkelberg, 1986; Filley and Aldag, 1978) and that less professional entrepreneurs
seek less outside equity because they are unaware of outside sources (Chaganti et al.,
1995). An interesting question to ask would be how experience relates to the
techniques utilized and how they change over time. The degree to which individual
characteristics impact the decision to bootstrap versus raise outside financing is an

<-----Page 12----->J. Ebben, A. Johnson / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 851–865

863

important consideration, as some researchers and practitioners believe that bootstrapping requires a firm to better manage itself (e.g., Baker et al., 2003; Starr and
MacMillan, 1990).
6.2. Limitations and conclusions
There are some shortcomings to this study in terms of the sample and survey.
Generalizations to the entire population of small firms based on the empirical results
should be made with some caution, as the sample is limited to small retail and service
firms in the Midwest and is subject to survivorship bias, which has been cited as an issue
with much research in entrepreneurship to date (Cassar, 2004). The sample may also have
self-selection bias, as it may be the case that respondents were only those owners that
could recall the bootstrapping methods used over time, as well as those that had the time
and interest in filling out surveys; however, there were no obvious differences between
firms that returned surveys and those that did not. Additionally, firms in the sample were
not asked to provide data on firm environment, which may play an important role in the
bootstrapping techniques available to firms (however, this was considered outside of the
scope of this study and should be addressed in future research).
The survey used here also suffers from typical biases related to survey research. Asking
survey subjects to recall to what extent they utilized certain techniques and to compare
past use to present use brings in the risk of spurious data if respondents cannot recall actual
past use, as respondents may tend to provide consistent responses over time (Rips et al.,
2003; Goldsmith, 1989). Eliminating firms over 40 years of age from the sample likely did
not completely address this issue. However, at the type of bootstrapping method level,
respondents did indicate some change from past to present. Respondents also did not
simply report a decline in levels of bootstrapping for all areas, as the results for different
types of bootstrapping methods are systematically different. This would indicate that
survey respondents did in fact try to accurately assess past and present use of
bootstrapping techniques.
Despite these limitations, this is the first study that the authors are aware of that applies
and empirically tests organizational theory with regard to bootstrapping in small firms.
While this study only begins to investigate this area, it does find promising evidence that
organizational theory may apply to bootstrapping and how it changes over time. Of course,
many more questions still remain concerning bootstrapping and small firm development,
and this is an important area of discovery given the prevalence of bootstrapping in new
and small firms and its theoretical importance to survival and growth. Future research
should further develop our understanding of the role of organizational theory in
bootstrapping, as it will help both researchers and practitioners determine how new and
small firms can put themselves in a better position for success.
