Abstract
Using experiments, we examine whether the decision to trust a stranger in a one-shot interaction
is equivalent to taking a risky bet, or if a trust decision entails an additional risk premium to balance
the costs of trust betrayal. We compare a binary-choice Trust game with a structurally identical,
binary-choice Risky Dictator game offering a good or a bad outcome. We elicit individuals’ minimum
acceptable probabilities (MAPs) of getting the good outcome such that they would prefer the gamble
to the sure payoff. First movers state higher MAPs in the Trust game than in situations where nature
determines the outcome.

1. Introduction
“It’s a vice to trust all, and equally a vice to trust none.” This sentiment from Seneca’s
Letters to Lucilius inspired our research on when and whom to trust. Seneca, the great
Roman first-century statesman and philosopher, recognized that trust always involves a
gamble. Nineteen centuries later, playwright Tennessee Williams noted the distinctive costs
of betrayal: “We have to distrust each other. It’s our only defense against betrayal.”
Today’s world of depersonalized investments and purchases by Internet enables us to secure great benefits from specialization, thus catering to particular preferences and providing
diversification. But one price of engaging in consequential relationships at a distance is that

Trustee).

one must choose to trust strangers. This paper analyzes experiments to determine whether
the decision to trust a stranger in a one-shot interaction is equivalent to taking a risky bet,
or if trust decisions entail an additional risk premium to balance the costs of trust betrayal.
To differentiate between risk preferences and possible betrayal costs as factors in decisions, we employ a novel design for trust experiments.1 We compare a binary-choice
Decision problem, where nature determines the outcome if people decide to trust, with a
binary-choice Trust game offering the same setup and payoffs.
We consider a decision format where a first mover (the Decision Maker) has to choose
between S (sure-thing) and T (trust). S results in a sure outcome S and T yields a risky
outcome that can be either G (good) or B (bad) for the Decision Maker. The Decision
Maker’s preference ordering is G > S > B. We first consider the decision when the chance
outcome after T involves a lottery. We then see what happens when the outcome after T is
determined by a second mover (the Trustee) whose payoffs at B, G, and S, are respectively
C, H, and S, with C > H > S (for mnemonic purposes C pairs with B and H with G see
Fig. 1). This ordering implies that the Trustee would prefer that the Decision Maker pick T.
However, if T were picked, since C > H, the Trustee would have the temptation to “betray”
and select B, making the Decision Maker worse off than had he chosen S.2 Presumably some
individuals are trustworthy and pick G; others are not and choose B. Our central question
is whether a Decision Maker merely makes a probabilistic assessment of trustworthiness
and then acts as if he were choosing between a certainty and a lottery, or whether the need
to trust introduces additional elements. That is, do the prospects for betrayal influence the
Decision Maker’s decision beyond mere probabilities?
A large body of work on trust, crossing many disciplines, assumes that the willingness to
trust is closely associated with the willingness to take risk (for example, within economics
see Ben-Ner and Putterman, 2001; within philosophy see Luhmann, 1979; within sociology,
see Cook and Cooper, 2003).3 Empirical evidence, however, is mixed. Results seem to

approaches that equate trust with a gamble or a risky investment.

depend on the measurement procedure used. Eckel and Wilson (this volume) find that
subjects’ self-reported risk attitudes (or “sensation seeking” as measured by the Zuckerman
Scale) influence the trust decision in a simplified version of the investment game (Berg et
al., 1995), but subjects’ revealed risk preferences for financial stakes do not. Ashraf et al.
(2003) also do not find any relationship between risk preferences revealed in a risky-choice
task and trust decisions in the investment game.
Snijders and Keren (1998) measure risk directly in a Trust game similar to ours. They
define risk as (S − B)/(G − B), which gives the probability of earning G that makes a risk
neutral person indifferent between trusting and not trusting. Varying the payoff structure,
the authors find that the risk ratio strongly affects trust. In addition to risk, the willingness
to trust is also influenced by “temptation,” (C − H)/(C − B), a measure of the Trustee’s
incentive to betray trust.4
While an attractive design, the risk preferences measured by Snijders and Keren are
influenced by the fact that risk is evaluated in the context of a Trust game. Risk taking
may be influenced by the Decision Maker’s expectations of trustworthiness (or expected
“temptation”), and by the fact that it is not nature but another person who decides whether
the Decision Maker will earn B or G. In contrast, the instruments used to measure risk
preferences in the studies by Ashraf et al. (2003) and Eckel and Wilson (this volume) seem
to be quite removed from the Trust decision, involving choices between lotteries whose
payoffs differ from the payoffs used in the Trust game. Most importantly, the typical choice
task in a risky decision experiment does not involve a second person. Rather, the first mover’s
choice affects only his own payoffs and does not lead to potential payoff differences between
him and a second person. We address these issues in our design.
We start with a standard risky-choice task, the Decision problem. For it, we elicit people’s
minimum acceptable probabilities (MAPs) of earning G for which they would prefer the
gamble to the sure payoff S. We inform subjects that prior to the experiment we determined
a probability, P∗ , of receiving G. If their MAP is higher than P∗ , they will earn S. However,
they will play the gamble with probability P∗ if their MAP is lower than or equal to P∗ . The
higher one’s MAP, the higher P∗ must be for the person to choose T over S. Thus, the less one
likes one or both outcomes in T, the higher will be one’s MAP. This mechanism is incentive
compatible. A rational Decision Maker should be indifferent between S and the gamble with
the reported MAP, since individuals cannot affect the probability they receive in the lottery.5
Our procedure is closely related to the Becker–DeGroot–Marshak elicitation procedure.
The principal difference is that we do not generate P∗ randomly from a uniform distribution.
In the Trust game, P∗ depends on the distribution of Trustees’ actions. Given our procedure,
truth-telling is as good as anything else. It is strictly dominant—the accomplishment
of the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak mechanism—if subjects subjectively assign positive
4 They find that subjects with an organ donor card also trusted more, suggesting that trust is also related to
other-regarding preferences (which is corroborated by the findings by Ashraf et al. (2003) and Cox (2004)).
5 This is equivalent to asking a consumer her willingness-to-pay for a good, with the understanding that the
good will be purchased at the market price if the market price turns out to be lower than the stated price. She has
no reason to misrepresent. This is a theoretical argument. We cannot exclude the possibility that our elicitation
procedure affects behavior differently than, for example, a standard choice task. Boles and Messick (1990), for
example, found that people sometimes regret the consequences that result when such minimal thresholds are
implemented.

probability to values of P∗ in the immediate neighborhood of their MAP. Potential
differences in subjective probability distributions in the three decision situations do not
matter as long as this condition is satisfied.
Our goal is to compare the Decision problem to the Trust game. However, the Trust
game has an additional element beyond the Decision problem: payoffs go to two players,
the Decision Maker and a second person. To reproduce this element apart from a trust
situation, we developed a third treatment, the Risky Dictator game. In it, the Decision
Maker’s choice affects a Recipient’s payoffs as well as his own. The Recipient is merely
that; she makes no decision. As before, the Decision Maker can take a sure payoff, S, or
take a chance between G and B. The probability of earning G is P∗ . His choice, and the
outcome of the gamble if taken, determines the Recipient’s payoff. The Recipient receives
S if the Decision Maker chooses S. If the Decision Maker chooses T, the Recipient gets H
or C, where C > H > S (see Fig. 1).
The Trust game, which we compare to the Risky Dictator game, offers the same payoffs
for the Decision Maker as both the Decision problem and the Risky Dictator game. It has
the same payoffs for the Trustee as the Risky Dictator game has for the Recipient. The
critical difference for the Trust game is that if T is chosen, another player, the Trustee,
not nature, determines the outcome. The Trustee prefers the outcome at B to the one at
G, whereas the Decision Maker prefers G. The probability of earning G is P∗ , which is
determined by the fraction of Trustees who reward trust. To determine the value of P∗
experimentally, we ran the Trust game first and then employed the identical P∗ in the
Decision problem and the Risky Dictator game.
If Decision Makers care only about their own payoffs and the probabilities of securing
them, the MAPs in all three games should be the same. However, concerns about payoffs
to others could create a wedge between the MAPs in the Decision problem and the Risky
Dictator game. Recent theoretical models and much empirical evidence suggest that the
Decision Maker may be motivated by altruism (Andreoni and Miller, 2002), efficiency
gains to the dyad (Charness and Rabin, 2002), or concerns about disparities in payoffs
(Fehr and Schmidt, 1999, Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000). Fehr and Schmidt (2001) survey
the evidence. For the numerical payoffs we employed, altruism and efficiency preferences
increase the attractiveness of the gamble in the Risky Dictator game compared to the
Decision problem, leading to lower MAPs in the former than in the latter. By contrast,
inequality aversion makes the gamble less attractive, inducing higher MAPs in the Risky
Dictator game than in the Decision problem. The net influence of the two effects is unclear
and would presumably depend on the size of the payoffs.
Our main interest is in the differences in decisions taken in the Trust game and in the two
other games. Our principal hypothesis is that it is fundamentally different to trust another
person than to rely on a random device that offers the same outcomes: people are averse to
being betrayed.6 Betrayal aversion is in line with recent theoretical models and empirical
6 Although people may dislike being betrayed for individualistic reasons, their feelings could be reinforced
through their understanding of the special significance of trust in society, as one of the referees noted. In a recent
issue of Science, Nowak and Sigmund (2000) called trust and reciprocity the “basis of all human systems of
morality”, and Bok (1978, p. 31) argued that “whatever matters to human beings, trust is the atmosphere in which
it thrives.”

evidence that people care about how outcomes came to be or others’ intentions (Rabin,
1993, Charness and Rabin, 2002). Thus, we conjecture that we will see higher MAPs in
the Trust game than in the Risky Dictator game. We also hypothesize that such differences
in MAPs apply to all demographic sub-groups. Even though some groups may be more
risk averse or less likely to trust than others, we expect betrayal aversion to be a universal
phenomenon. This paper tests main effects and controls for differences between various
demographic sub-groups.
Our paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the central hypothesis, and Section 3
the details of the experimental design. Section 4 reports the results, and Section 5 concludes.
2. Central hypothesis
Our central hypothesis is that individuals incur an additional, non-monetary loss when
their trust is betrayed by their Trustee. This loss will make them more reluctant to take a
chance on another individual being trustworthy, as opposed to taking a chance on a random
device. We measure this effect by comparing MAPs across games.
Consider an individual with von Neumann–Morgenstern preferences choosing between
S and T for the Decision problem described in the Introduction. He attaches utilities to the
three outcomes, denoted as US , UG and UB . His MAP will satisfy the equation
US = MAP(UG ) + (1 − MAP)UB .

(1)

Solving for MAP, we have
MAP =

US − UB
.
UG − U B

(2)

Note that this formulation is general and can allow for a payoff to another player. Thus,
it applies to the Risky Dictator (RD) and Trust games (Trust), not merely the Decision
problem (DP).
Our principal conjecture is that when a Decision Maker gets the bad outcome in the Trust
game (when his trust is betrayed), he incurs an additional negative element. We call this a
betrayal cost. This implies that
UB(Trust) < UB(RD) ,

even when the monetary payoffs are the same in the two
What happens to MAP as UB falls? A falling UB makes the gamble less attractive,
implying that MAP will have to be raised if the Decision Maker is to remain indifferent
between S and T.8 Hence, our theory predicts that individuals will have a greater MAP for

reward”) that exceeds the utility from a good outcome produced by chance. If honor rewards matter, betrayal costs
have to be larger to lead to our prediction: MAPTrust > MAPRD . We observe net outcomes in our experiments only.
They could be due to betrayal costs or to a combination of betrayal costs and honor rewards.

the Trust game than for the Risky Dictator game, although the payoffs are identical:
MAPTrust > MAPRD .
3. Experimental design
We employ three treatment conditions to test for the role of betrayal aversion: a Decision
problem, a Risky Dictator and a Trust game. The games have identical payoffs for the
Decision Maker. The Risky Dictator game and the Trust game have a second player, called
respectively Recipient and Trustee. In our experiments, S = 10, G = 15, B = 8, H = 15, and
C = 22. The payoffs were presented to subjects in a matrix form with neutral terminology
(see Table A1). Payoffs were given in points, which were converted 1:1 into US dollars at
the end of the experiment.
Our experiments were run in the experimental laboratory of the Harvard Business School.
Participants were recruited by advertisements in student newspapers in the greater Boston
area; 145 people participated: 25 Decision Makers in the Decision problem, 29 pairs in the
Risky Dictator game, and 31 pairs in the Trust game. We first ran the Trust game in two
sessions, then the Decision problem in one session and the Risky Dictator game in two
sessions. Subjects earned a US$ 10-show up fee and received on average an additional US$
13 for an experiment that took approximately 30–40 min.
We did not inform any of our subjects on the value of the probabilities involved in the
risky choice but asked them to indicate their minimum acceptable probability of earning G
such that they would be willing to accept the gamble rather than take the sure outcome. If
their MAP was higher than a predetermined probability, P∗ , they were taken to reject the
chance outcome. They were paid the sure payoff. If their MAP was lower than or equal to
P∗ , we conducted the lottery (Decision problem and Risky Dictator game) or let the Trustee
decide (Trust game). The lower one’s MAP, the more one is willing to take the risk.
The value of P∗ was established by the fraction of Trustees who chose to reward trust
in the Trust game in the first two sessions. Though it was not necessary for the experiment,
the payoffs were selected (and pre-tested in classroom experiments) so that the expected
fraction of trustworthy Trustees would be close to the value of P that makes a risk neutral
player indifferent between choosing the sure outcome or the gamble, which implies a 0.285
chance of G. In the first Trust experiment, 4 out of 14 Trustees rewarded trust (P = 0.286)
and in the second session, 5 out of 17 Trustees rewarded trust (P = 0.294), or P = 0.290
overall. In practice, we set P∗ = 0.29 by having 29 white marbles in an urn of 100 marbles.
In the Decision problem and the Risky Dictator game, we informed Decision Makers
that P∗ had been determined before they made their decisions. They were not told how it
was arrived at. The value of P∗ was written on a piece of paper and sealed in an envelope
that everyone could see taped to the blackboard.
The Trust game required a different treatment for P∗ . We asked Trustees whether they
would pick G if the Decision Maker selected T.9 We asked Decision Makers, who were
assigned Trustees at random, what minimum percentage of trustworthy behavior (MAP)
9

That is, we used the strategy method for Trustees. This method has been found to produce similar results in
the investment game as standard experimental choice procedures (e.g., Ashraf et al., 2003).

<-----Page 6----->I. Bohnet, R. Zeckhauser / J. of Economic Behavior & Org. 55 (2004) 467–484

they would require to select T. If the percentage of trustworthy Trustees in their experiment
equaled or exceeded their MAP, we informed them of this, and the two payoffs were
decided by whether their Trustee then chose G or B. Otherwise, we informed them that
the percentage of trustworthy Trustees in their experiment was lower than their MAP, and
they earned the sure payoff of 10.
Each session was organized as follows:
1. Description of the game and the rules of conduct (identical for Decision Makers and
second movers for games that involve both).
The payoffs were presented and described both in writing and orally to establish common
knowledge. Subjects were informed that this was a one-shot interaction, that, except in
the DP, they were randomly matched with another person present in the room, that they
were identified by code numbers only, and that they would remain anonymous.
2. Explanation of decisions (different for Decision Makers and second movers).
The Decision Makers and the second movers were given different sets of instructions,
detailing their own decision. They were not informed on the exact wording of their counterpart’s decision. Most importantly, Trustees were not informed that Decision Makers
were asked to state their MAP of being paired with a Trustee who rewards trust since we
did not want Trustees to try to influence P∗ . Decision Makers knew that Trustees were
not informed on P∗ and that their actions would not determine P∗ .
a) Decision Makers were asked in the three games:
Trust: “How large would the probability of being paired with a Person Y who
chose option 1 have to be for you to pick B over A?”
DP and RD: “How large would P have to be for you to pick B over A?”
In all treatments, they were told that if their P is lower than or equal to P∗ , they would
play the gamble, and if it was higher than P∗ , they would earn S.
b) Second movers were asked (Trustees in Trust, Recipients in RD and no second mover
in DP):
Trust: “Which option, 1 or 2, do you choose in case B?”
RD: “Please wait until your counterpart has made a decision.”
3. Quiz.
We tested whether Decision Makers understood the task and made sure that everyone
had answered the test questions correctly before continuing.10
4. Decision making.
Trust: Decision Makers and Trustees made their decisions simultaneously.
DP and RD: Only Decision Makers had a decision to make.
5. Information on P∗ and its implications for each subject.
We informed everyone on the details of the decision procedure and on P∗ .
Trust: Here P∗ was the fraction of Trustees who had chosen to reward trust in their
session. If P∗ was greater than or equal to a Decision Maker’s MAP, his Trustee’s
10 We presented a number of hypothetical scenarios to Decision Makers, covering the whole range of possible
P-values, such as: Assume that your P = 0.05 and P∗ = 0.1. Will you participate in the lottery or not? In each
session, there were 1–3 Decision Makers who did not understand the game in the first attempt. We corrected
their mistakes, gave the corrected quiz back, and asked them to answer more questions. We proceeded with the
experiment once everyone had answered a set of three questions correctly.

decision determined the outcome. If P∗ was less than her MAP, he got the sure
outcome.
DP and RD: We opened the envelope and informed subjects that P∗ = 0.29. If P∗ was
greater than or equal to a Decision Maker’s MAP, he got the gamble.11 If P∗ was less
than his MAP, he got the sure outcome.
6. Questionnaire and payment.
Subjects completed a questionnaire (see Table A2) while we put their earnings in sealed
envelopes marked with their code numbers. Subjects collected their earnings by presenting their code numbers.

4. Experimental results
We focus on treatment effects first. We then test for their robustness by including some
key demographic variables. Table 1 and Fig. 2 summarize our primary findings.
The overall pattern is clear. MAPs are much higher in the Trust game than in the Risky
Dictator game (or in the Decision problem). In contrast, MAPs in the Risky Dictator game
do not seem to differ from the MAPs in the Decision problem. Fig. 2 shows the complete
distribution of values for the three conditions.
We now investigate the significance of those differences.
Result 1. Betrayal costs MAPTrust > MAPRD .
The mean and median MAPs are noticeably higher in the Trust game than in the Risky
Dictator game. A nonparametric ranks test revealed that Trust game MAPs were significantly
higher (Mann–Whitney Z = −3.430, P < 0.01).
Our results suggest that the decision to trust is influenced by more than just risk, otherregarding, and efficiency preferences. People care not only about the payoff outcome but
also about how the outcome came to be. They behave as though there is a betrayal cost
above and beyond any dollar losses.12
11 We conducted the lottery as follows: we put 29 white and 71 black marbles into a bowl. For each first mover
with P∗ ≥ MAP, we pulled a ball from the bowl (and then replaced it). We informed the subjects for which code
number we were conducting the lottery. If the marble was white, they (and their Recipient in the Risky Dictator
game) earned G. If the marble was black, they earned B (and their Recipient earned F in the Risky Dictator game).
12 We discuss below alternative hypotheses that could conceivably produce the observed pattern. The difference
in MAPs between the trust decision and other decisions may have been magnified because P∗ is relatively low in
the range between 0 and 1.

Fig. 2. Cumulative distributions of MAPs.

Result 2. Other-regarding and efficiency preferences MAPRD = MAPDP .
The mean and median MAPs are quite similar in the Risky Dictator game and in the
Decision problem. A nonparametric ranks test did not identify any significant differences.
Our results suggest that a willingness to take a gamble that will definitely benefit another
party is not strongly influenced on net by either payoff comparisons or efficiency differences.
There is an interesting anomaly in the Risky Dictator game at the bottom end: 28 percent
of the Decision Makers had a MAP less than 0.285, the value that made T a breakeven
proposition. Presumably, these individuals were motivated by altruism or by a concern for
efficiency.
Our first two results are in line with our principal hypothesis, namely that there are
significant betrayal costs. Indeed, these costs are sufficient to swamp any honor reward
for receiving trustworthy behavior and getting G. As a result, subjects need a much higher
chance to receive the good outcome to choose T in the Trust game than in the Risky Dictator
game or the Decision problem.13
Result 3. Decision Maker’s choices by own demographic category.
Do our results differ by standard demographic categories? There was little variability in
our subject pool in some important categories. All of our 145 subjects were students (76
percent undergraduates), 88 percent were younger than 30, 89 percent were American, 72
percent identified with a religion, and 92 percent ranked themselves in the lower half of the
income distribution on a scale from 1 to 6 (see Table A2 for the questionnaire).
Our sample varied most on gender and ethnicity with 42 percent of our subjects being
female and 33 percent identifying themselves as members of an ethnic or racial minority.
13

The MAP for the Trust game is also significantly greater than the MAP for the Decision problem
(Mann–Whitney Z = −2.696, P < 0.01).

We focus on these two characteristics. Recent survey evidence suggests that “members of
a group that historically felt discriminated against,” particularly minorities and women, are
less likely than Caucasians or men to report that they “generally trust others” (Alesina and
La Ferrara, 2002, p. 207). We examine whether women and minority group members in our
experiment had higher MAPs than men and Caucasians, respectively.
Table 2 gives the principal MAP results separately for each treatment condition by our
demographic groups, focusing on race and gender.
We first compare results in the Decision problem. There were no significant differences
in the values of MAPs by gender or ethnicity. That is, members of these groups were equally
willing to take gambles on their own payoffs. If differences emerge in the Risky Dictator
game or the Trust game, it will be because the groups have different preferences regarding
payoffs to others, efficiency, or betrayal.
Looking at the Decision problem and the Risky Dictator game, we find that the MAPs
of women and minorities do not differ between the two treatments. Men and Caucasians
accept somewhat lower MAPs in the Risky Dictator game than in the Decision problem,
implying either some other-regarding preferences or tastes for efficiency.14 Our results are
in line with earlier findings on gender and efficiency preferences. Andreoni and Vesterlund
(2001) and Ashraf et al. (2003) find that men respond more strongly to efficiency gains in
various non-risky versions of the dictator game than women. While women have generally
14 For men: Mann–Whitney Z = −1.782, P = 0.075; for whites: Mann–Whitney Z = −2.097, P = 0.036.
Comparing the behavior of men and women, Caucasians and minorities and those who trust both (or men) versus
those who trust women only in RD reveals a significant difference for the last comparison only. Those who trust
women only have significantly higher MAPs in RD than those who trust both or men (Mann–Whitney Z = −2.316,
P = 0.021).

been found to be more generous (e.g., Bohnet and Frey, 1999, Eckel and Grossman, 1998),
the relative cost of or benefits from giving hardly affect their behavior. The relationship
between race and risk, efficiency, and other-regarding preferences has received little study.
Our primary interest is in differences in behavior between the Trust game and the Risky
Dictator game. For each of our demographic groups, the MAPs for the Trust game substantially exceed those for the Risky Dictator game with equivalent payoffs. This indicates
that each of these groups is concerned with betrayal. Women and minorities appear to
have higher Trust game MAPs than their complement groups but these differences are not
statistically significant.
Past evidence on the relevance of race and gender in trust experiments is mixed. Results
depend on the specifics of the experimental design (such as the degree of anonymity between
the players) and the country where the experiments were conducted. For a subject pool
similar to ours, Glaeser et al. (2000) report that minority and female Harvard undergraduates
are less likely than others to trust. Croson and Buchan (1999) find no significant gender
differences in trust experiments in the US and various Asian countries. Ashraf et al. (2003)
also report no significant gender differences while noting that minority groups are less likely
to trust (the race gap is more pronounced in South Africa than in the United States). In a recent
large-scale experiment focusing on gender, Buchan et al. (2003) find that female students
are less likely to trust than male students. Eckel and Wilson (2003) are among the few
who report a higher trust rate for American women than for men. Generally, demographic
variables seem to be more strongly associated with the Trustee’s decision of whether or not
to be trustworthy than with the Decision Maker’s decision of whether or not to trust (Croson
and Buchan, 1999, Chaudhuri and Gangadharan, 2002, Cox, 2004, Eckel and Wilson, 2003).
Result 4. Decision Maker’s choices by preferred demographic category of counterpart.
Rather than focusing only on subjects’ own characteristics, we may learn more about why
Decision Makers demanded a certain MAP by looking at the demographic characteristics
of their preferred counterparts. Thus, we asked our subjects what an “ideal” Trustee would
look like, focusing again on the six characteristics: age, ethnicity, gender, whether someone
identifies with a religion, nationality, and economic situation (see Table A2). Within all
categories of respondents, a majority indicates that it trusts all groups.
Focusing on ethnicity/race, 67 percent of our respondents indicate that they trust both
Caucasians and members of a minority, 19 percent trust minority members only, and 14
percent trust Caucasians only (see Table A3). Gender presents a different picture. Only a
slim majority of our Decision Makers trusts both men and women (51 percent), 40 percent
trust women only, and 9 percent trust men only. The gender attributions of trustworthiness
reported here conform to earlier findings on gender-role stereotypic attributions of cooperation and defection in the prisoners’ dilemma game. King et al. (1991) found that both
genders believe that a male is more likely to defect.15
15

While the sample sizes get quite small, we do want to note that the Decision Maker’s identity seems to affect
these assessments: Only 39 percent of the female but 59 percent of the male Decision Makers trust both sexes
(chi2 = 2.959, P < 0.1). Fifty-five percent of the female Decision Makers trust women only and 30 percent of the
male Decision Makers trust women only (chi2 = 4.586, P < 0.05). Six percent of the female and 11 percent of

<-----Page 11----->478

Those who trust women only demand significantly higher MAPs than those who trust
both or only men. (MAPtrust women only = 0.68 whereas MAPothers = 0.49; Mann–Whitney
Z = −2.030, P = 0.042). While the MAPs of those who trust women or minorities only
typically exceed their complement groups’ MAPs, the differences in the Risky Dictator
game and the Decision problem are not statistically significant.
Result 5. Relative importance of treatment effects and demographic variables.
To test more precisely whether our treatment effects are robust and whether the identified sub-population differences indeed matter, we ran an OLS regression on MAPs (see
Table A4). The regressions confirm the differences between the three treatment conditions.
Columns 1 and 2 show that the requested MAPs are higher in the Trust game than in the
Risky Dictator game, but that there is no difference between the Risky Dictator game and
the Decision problem. Nonwhite women demand noticeably higher MAPs than everyone
else. Their mean requested MAPs are 0.43 in the Decision problem, 0.52 in the Risky
Dictator Game, and 0.74 in the Trust game. In column 3, we test whether the gender of
the ideal Trustee is related to the requested MAPs and whether it interacts with a subject’s
own gender. We find that independent of own gender, those who trust only women demand
significantly higher MAPs than those who either trust men only or both.16
4.1. Alternative explanations
Our principal result is that individuals have higher MAPs in the Trust game than in the
Risky Dictator game with the same payoffs or a Decision problem offering the same own
payoffs. Such a finding suggests that betrayal costs – i.e., costs that make it less attractive to
rely on a Trustee than a random device offering the same probabilities – are consequential.
However, in addition to (or in place of) betrayal costs, other elements could enter a Decision
Maker’s utility function. We discuss competing hypotheses here that could conceivably be
compatible with our results.
It might appear that the desire to keep in control, rather than the costs of betrayal, could
be reducing the attractiveness of the Trust game and leading to MAPTrust > MAPRD . The
controllability of risk has been identified as an important determinant of risk perceptions
and risk taking in risky-choice tasks (e.g., Slovic et al., 1986). We rewrite Eq. (1) from
above to take the cost relating to a loss of control, K, into account:
US(Trust) = MAP(UG ) + (1 − MAP)UB − K.

(4)

the male Decision Makers trust men only (tests n.a.). Only 45 percent of the minority responders but 76 percent
of the Caucasians trust both categories (chi2 = 5.949, P < 0.05). Fifty percent of the minority Decision Makers
but only 6 percent of Caucasians trust minority members only (chi2 = 17.883, P < 0.01). Five percent of the
minority and 18 percent of Caucasian Decision Makers trust Caucasians only (tests n.a.). The in-group bias seems
most pronounced among the groups that have traditionally been discriminated against, women and members of
minorities.
16 We have also tested for interactions between the demographic variables and our treatments. As the summary
statistics already suggest, neither the gender nor the race interactions are significant.

479

As the Risky Dictator game does not involve relinquishing control to a second person,
Eq. (4) implies that
US(Trust) > US(RD) .

(5)

To compensate for the loss of control when trusting another person, a Decision Maker
thus would demand a higher MAP in the Trust game than in the Risky Dictator game, which
is what we find.
Alternative additional costs in the Trust game (suggested by one of the referees) include
assessment costs (i.e., the cost related to having to assess someone’s trustworthiness), costs
of making a mistaken assessment, and costs from putting another person into an uncomfortable situation (also leading to US (Trust) > US (RD) ). A final alternative explanation might
be that Decision Makers dislike earning money due to another person’s kindness (leading
to UG(Trust) < UG(RD) ).
A MAP gives us information on how a Decision Maker assesses the risky-choice problem he is confronted with, but not on how he values each possible outcome. Based on
our data, we are not able to distinguish whether differences in MAPs are due to different
assessments of S or of B and G. However, a number of recent experimental results are compatible with betrayal costs but not with any of the alternative hypotheses. In gift-exchange
experiments, for example, employers play a Trust game with their employees. They have
to decide whether to offer a high or a low wage to encourage employees to respond with
high effort. Offering a high wage is risky as employees may shirk, but it may also induce
fair-minded employees to reciprocate such trust with high effort levels. Several studies have
found that employers are willing to pay for the opportunity to punish untrustworthy employees (for a summary, see Gächter and Fehr, 2001). Such behavior, we believe, is consistent
with betrayal aversion but not with an aversion to losing control, making a wrong assessment, relying on another’s kindness or confronting another person with an uncomfortable
decision.

5. Conclusions
For thousands of life’s risky decisions, be they of the heart or the wallet, from the
everyday to the fundamental, trust is a critical ingredient. Economists now recognize that
trust is required if a society is to prosper. Trust has been shown to contribute to economic
growth (Knack and Keefer, 1997, Zak and Knack, 2001) and to enhance some of the factors
that promote it, such as judicial efficiency and reduced corruption (La Porta et al., 1997).
Trust involves a chance outcome under the control of another party; for example, will the
businesswoman deliver a product of the quality she promised? Some risks effectively involve
a lottery process: will the crop be good, will stock X increase in value? Our experimental
studies find that individuals are much more willing to take risks when the outcome is due
to chance than when it depends on whether another player proves trustworthy. Taking a
chance on the latter risks incurring betrayal costs, costs shown to be above and beyond
mere monetary losses.

Betrayal costs may contribute to the distinction between intentional and accidental
wrongs in both civil and common law. Intentional wrongs are more likely to meet the
criteria of criminal conduct and, thus, can be punished more severely. In addition, liability
for intentional harm cannot be excluded contractually although the parties to a contract can
agree to exclude liability for accidental wrongs. Lawmakers seem to understand that people
have to be protected more from intentional than from accidental harm. Therefore, incentives
have to be in place to keep Trustees from intentionally inflicting harm on Decision Makers.
Absent such arrangements, as our results suggest, interactions based on trust may not take
place.
