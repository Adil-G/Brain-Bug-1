Business angels have been highlighted as important stakeholders for potential highgrowth ventures. Extant empirical research provides evidence that they not only
contribute with money but also bring added value to the ventures in which they have
invested. However, despite the reported beneﬁts of the value added provided by these
investors there are very few studies that try to conceptualize this important issue. The
present study seeks to meet this shortcoming by presenting a review of literature and
research on business angels and value added. The overall objective is to recognize the
range of value added activities that business angels have been reported to perform,
aggregate the ﬁndings into a set of distinct but complementary value adding roles, and
then link these roles to theoretical perspectives that explain why they have the potential
to contribute to added value. Four diﬀerent value added roles performed by informal
investors are presented together with an explanation of how they can be seen as
complementary to each other. The following discussion is then used to guide future
studies of business angels and value added towards areas where our knowledge is still
limited.
Keywords: business angels; value added; informal venture capital

Introduction
Business angels are individuals who oﬀer risk capital to unlisted ﬁrms in which they have
no family-related connections.1 Today it is widely acknowledged that business angels play
a vital role in the development and growth of new ventures, in terms of both the ﬁnancial
capital they invest as well as oﬀering their business skills and personal networks they have
acquired throughout their professional lives (Mason 2006; Kelly 2007). However, despite
the widespread recognition that business angels generally contribute with value added in
addition to their ﬁnancial investments there is very little detailed investigation of the kind
of value added they provide to support the continued development and growth of their
portfolio ﬁrms (Lumme, Mason, and Suomi 1998). There are indeed some empirical data
on these issues (e.g. Ehrlich et al. 1994; Mason and Harrison 1996), but the existing results
are scattered throughout a broad number of studies and the theoretical underpinnings of
what business angels do and how they add value are still relatively weak. Based on this
observation, the overall objective of this article is to recognize the range of value added
activities that business angels have been reported to perform, aggregate the ﬁndings into a

set of distinct but complementary value adding roles, and then to link these roles to
theoretical perspectives that explain why they have the potential to contribute with added
value. This objective is met through a review of literature and research on business angels
and value added.
The rest of the paper proceeds in ﬁve sections. The next section presents an overview of
literature and research on business angels and value added. Thereafter follows a section
with a description of how relevant papers on the subject were identiﬁed. Then an overview
of research that has reported on the value added services of business angels is provided.
Four distinct value adding roles are identiﬁed based on this overview and the roles are
linked to theoretical perspectives. The discussion continues by presenting some suggestions
for future research on business angels and value added. The paper ends with a concluding
summary.
Value added contributions by business angels: what do we know?
The scholarly attention to business angels has increased rapidly in recent years and we can
today ﬁnd studies from a wide range of countries, including the US (Wetzel 1981, 1983;
Harr, Starr, and MacMillan 1988; Aram 1989; Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 1997), Canada
(Duxbury, Haines, and Riding 1996), the UK (Mason, Harrison, and Chaloner 1991;
Mason and Harrison 1994; Mason and Harrison 1996; Van Osnabrugge 1998; Kelly 2000;
Paul, Whittam, and Johnston 2003), Germany (Stedler and Peters 2003), Japan (Tashiro
1999; Kutsuna and Harada 2004), Singapore (Hindle and Lee 2002), Australia (Hindle and
Wenban 1999), and the Nordic countries (Landström 1992, 1993, 1995, 1998; Suomi and
Lumme 1994; Reitan and Sørheim 2000; Sørheim and Landström 2001). Compared with
the very earliest studies in the ﬁeld (i.e. Wetzel 1981, 1983), the accumulated knowledge on
business angels over the past two decades has generated a fairly robust description of the
actors in the business angel market (Mason 2006). In particular, research has revealed that
the typical business angel is a middle aged male who invests a relatively large amount of
his personal wealth, most often in young and technology-oriented ﬁrms (Mason, Harrison,
and Chaloner 1991; Duxbury, Haines, and Riding 1996; Hindle and Wenban 1999;
Tashiro 1999; Reitan and Sørheim 2000; Hindle and Lee 2002; Stedler and Peters 2003).
The working relationship between the business angel and the entrepreneur can in most
cases be characterized as fairly active. The most common form of business angel
involvement seems to be by way of working on the board of directors and by providing
consultancy services to the ﬁrm when required (Mason, Harrison, and Chaloner 1991;
Landström 1993; Mason and Harrison 1996; Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 1997; Tashiro 1999;
Hindle and Lee 2002). Extant research has also pointed out that business angels tend to
work closely with their portfolio ﬁrms as a means of both promoting and protecting their
interests. Even if business angels are a very heterogeneous population (e.g. Stevenson and
Coveney 1996) there seem to be some defensible generalities among many of them.
One of the general assumptions about business angels is that they are expected to be
value adding investors who, in addition to the supply of ﬁnancial capital, also support the
development of new ventures by means of their professional and personal knowledge and
skills.2 This largely stems from the enterprise background that most business angels have,
which often includes entrepreneurial and management experience (Aernoudt 1999; Politis
and Landström 2002; De Clerq et al. 2006). Several studies have pointed out that business
angels have a genuine entrepreneurial career background, in which they often have made
their fortunes through a cash-out of their own previous ventures. In the early US study of
business angels conducted by Wetzel (1981) he reported that 78% had previous start-up

129

experience. In a later US study, Gaston (1989) reported that more than 83% of the
surveyed business angels had previous start-up experience. This pattern can also be found
in studies outside the US. In a UK study by Mason, Harrison, and Chaloner (1991) they
found that 67% of the surveyed business angels had previous start-up experience. Tashiro
(1999) examined business angels in Japan and found that about 60% had experience from
founding their own business. In another study of business angels in Singapore, Hindle and
Lee (2002) found that 72% had experience from managing their own businesses. Brettel
(2003) report a similar ﬁgure in his study of German business angels where 75% of the
investors had previously started up their own companies. He also noted that about twothirds of them have been involved in starting up two or more companies. However, the
most impressive results in terms of prior entrepreneurial experience come from studies in
the Nordic countries. In a Swedish study Landström (1993) reported that as many as 96%
of the business angels had previous start-up experience, while Suomi and Lumme (1994) in
a study from Finland reported a similar ﬁgure of 95%. Furthermore, in a study of
Norwegian business angels, Reitan and Sørheim (2000) stated that even if ‘only’ 46% of
the surveyed business angels had prior start-up experience most of them had management
experience from new ventures or in relation to company ownership.
It seems that a consistent pattern across a wide range of diﬀerent countries and
contexts is that the larger majority of business angels seem to have acquired the kind of
experience it takes to start, manage and harvest a successful entrepreneurial venture (Van
Osnabrugge 1998; Wright, Westhead, and Sohl 1998; Aernoudt 1999). Hence, judging
from these prior studies it seems reasonable to assume that the business angels’ prior
career background has prepared them to conduct the due diligence necessary to evaluate
the merits and risks of prospective informal investments, and to add value in the ventures
in which they invest based on their experientially acquired business know-how (Politis and
Landström 2002). In particular business angels can be expected to contribute with a wide
range of value adding services, such as commercial skills, entrepreneurial experience,
business know-how and contacts (Lumme, Mason, and Suomi 1998; De Clerq et al. 2006;
Mason 2006). Moreover, this contribution is facilitated through a variety of hands-on
roles ranging from board membership to less structured consulting activities and
formalized part-time employments (Landström 1993; Mason and Harrison 1996).
However, a more systematic account of what value added roles business angels actually
perform is yet to be developed. Empirical reports on the issue are scattered across various
contexts with diﬀerent levels of detail, and the theoretical underpinnings of the value
added contributions provided by business angels are not very clear. In order to meet this
shortcoming in the literature, this paper will review scholarly publications on business
angels and value added to identify the range of value adding activities that business angels
have been reported to perform. The aim is to aggregate the ﬁndings into a set of distinct
but complementary value adding roles performed by business angels and to link the
identiﬁed roles to theoretical perspectives that explain why they have the potential to
contribute with added value.
Method: tracking papers on business angels and value added
A systematic search was undertaken to identify studies that have addressed the value
added contributions of business angels. The inclusion criterion was that the study should
be a published empirical study reporting on value added performed by business angels in
the post-investment phase. Studies met the exclusion criteria if they did not give any
detailed account of the value added hands-on contributions performed by business angels,

such as studies comparing performance diﬀerences between companies with and without
business angel ﬁnancing (e.g. Mason and Harrison 2002; Chahine, Filatotchev, and
Wright 2007).
With regard to search strategy, the following databases were searched for potential
studies on the subject: ABI/Inform, BLDS (British Library for Development Studies),
Business Insights, EBSCO, EconLit (SCA), Emerald Insight, JSTOR, and Source OECD.
Keywords used in the electronic database search included combinations of the following
words: business angel, informal investor, informal venture capital, value added,
contribution, post-investment phase. A secondary search of the bibliographies of the
studies identiﬁed was then also undertaken to check for papers that could be relevant to
include in the sample.
Titles and abstracts of identiﬁed studies that were identiﬁed by the database and
secondary searches were examined for possible relevance with respect to the inclusion
criteria. In this phase I tried to minimize subjectivity leading to biased selection in two
ways. First, I included studies by strict adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria
described above. Second, a colleague did an independent evaluation of the articles
identiﬁed in the literature searches. Our results were then compared to check for and
minimize potential biases. The outcome of this process identiﬁed 14 empirical studies
reporting on value adding activities performed by business angels in the post-investment
phase. The identiﬁed studies will be presented below.
Value added contributions provided by business angels
The literature review has identiﬁed 14 empirical studies published between 1992 and 2005
that explicitly have addressed the issue of business angels and value added. In a UK study
of 36 informal venture capital-backed new ventures, Harrison and Mason (1992) identify
many types of support given by business angels to their investee companies. Acting as
sounding board was their most valuable hands-on contribution and many entrepreneurs
found their involvement in the development of marketing plans, business strategies and
products to be highly rewarding. In several cases they also were involved in the
recruitment of the management team. Similar results were reported by Ehrlich et al. (1994)
in a study of 47 US entrepreneurs which have received venture capital from business
angels. They found that the most important areas of value added were interfacing with the
investor group, monitoring ﬁnancial performance, serving as a sounding board, and
formulating business strategy. In another US study, Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel (1995)
report the ﬁndings from a study of 124 ﬁrms that have raised one or more rounds of
venture capital from business angels. This study emphasizes the more interpersonal
contributions from business angels, noting that they add value mainly through
establishing a productive and trustful working relationship with the management team
in the venture they ﬁnance.
Reporting from a survey of 31 business angels and 28 owner-managers in the UK,
Mason and Harrison (1996) found that the main contribution of business angels was the
provision of strategic advice. Other important contributions in the study included
networking (especially with customers), ﬁnance and accounting, and general management.
The surveyed investors believed their single most important contribution was their general
business experience. However, there was no consensus about which contribution was
perceived as the most important by the entrepreneurs. Speciﬁc contributions that were
mentioned included providing help in diverse areas such as accounting, project planning,
marketing, and ﬁnancial control. In addition, there were some interpersonal contributions

reported such as ‘lifting the spirits’, ‘sharing the burden’ and ‘providing a broader view’
(Mason and Harrison 1996, 117). In another study, Stevenson and Coveney (1996) report
ﬁndings from a study of 484 business angels in the UK. They ﬁnd that investors perceive
the provision of advice and hands-on involvement to be their main value added
contribution. Lumme, Mason, and Suomi (1998) report from a study of 59 business angels
in Finland. They identify no fewer than 22 diﬀerent types of value adding contributions
provided by business angels to their investee businesses. The 22 diﬀerent types of
contributions were sorted under ﬁve main themes: strategic management and control,
assistance in operational management and control systems, networking, industry
knowledge, and resourcing new dynamic business structures. Among other things, the
result indicates that Finnish business angels make an extremely wide range of diﬀerent
contributions.
Tashiro (1999) in his study of 20 Japanese business angels noted that they often
provided business advice to the businesses in which they invested. This support was
usually in the area of management, but some also provided more speciﬁc advice regarding
technology, human resources or ﬁnance. In a study of 27 serial business angels in the US,
Ardichvili et al. (2002) report that the investors provide a wide range of non-ﬁnancial
resources to their portfolio ﬁrms. These activities include shaping the business concept or
business model of the new venture, ﬁnding and recruiting the management team and key
personnel, ﬁnding additional sources of capital and helping to establish social networks. In
addition, the investors were highly involved in the governance of the new ﬁrm. Paul,
Whittam, and Johnston (2003) surveyed business angels in Scotland. Among their 140
usable responses they found that the main non-ﬁnancial value added beneﬁts were
provision of business contacts, enhancing the management skills in the new venture, and
helping with raising additional funds. Sætre (2003) in a study of 20 Norwegian business
angels reports that these investors provided access to industry insights which greatly
augmented the ﬁrms’ ability to make strategic choices, and that the access to their highlevel industry networks facilitated the enactment of these strategies. Some investors also
made demands for information and reports concerning the development of the business to
keep up with the day-to-day running of the business. Brettel (2003) in a study of 40
German business angels reports that the most important contributions made by these
investors were the use of their personal networks, their involvement in coaching the
entrepreneur and their provision of ﬁnancial know-how. Other contributions included
their provision of marketing know-how, management experience and their knowledge of
the industry, helping with strategy development, and searching for and choosing executive
personnel.
Amatucci and Sohl (2004) made an in-depth study of four women entrepreneurs in the
US who obtained business angel ﬁnancing. In their study they report that the business
angels served as mentors and were also deeply involved in both strategic and operational
activities. In another in-depth study of four business angels in Norway by Sørheim (2005)
he recognized the value added contribution of business angels reported in the literature but
also demonstrated that experienced business angels may play a value adding key role as
facilitators for further ﬁnance. This ability was primarily and strongly aﬀected by their
previous track record as developers of entrepreneurial ﬁrms. This link to further ﬁnance is
evident also in Madill, Haines, and Riding (2005) who in a study of Canadian technologybased ﬁrms who had received investments from business angels report that these investors
helped the ﬁrms to become ‘investment ready’ for future rounds of investment from
venture capital ﬁrms. This was realized through active involvement in value added
activities such as providing networking opportunities, hands-on assistance (legal advice,

accountancy advice, and provision of resources) and business and marketing intelligence.
This active involvement by business angels gave credibility to the ﬁrms in which they had
invested and increased their attractiveness to institutional venture capitalists.
The empirical reports reviewed above show a wide range of diﬀerent value added
activities provided by business angels. These studies undoubtedly have great merit in
showing the value added potential of business angels. However, without the accumulation
of knowledge around a concentrated set of distinct value adding roles on a fairly
aggregated level there may be a risk that continued research on this topic leads to a
growing fragmentation rather than a growing consensus in the ﬁeld. Instead, focusing on
similarities rather than on pluralism and contextual diﬀerences may be a better starting
point for an enhanced scholarly understanding of business angels and value added. To
follow this suggestion, the empirical reports have been summarized in Table 1, together
with an attempt to categorize them at a more aggregated level.
The right column of Table 1 has identiﬁed a limited set of distinct but complementary
value adding roles that business angels have been reported to perform. These roles are:

sounding board/strategic role;
supervision and monitoring role;
resource acquisition role; and
mentoring role.

Each of these value added roles will be deﬁned and discussed with the attempt to link them
to theoretical perspectives that explain why these roles have the potential to contribute
with added value.
Sounding board/strategic role
The most frequent value added role performed by business angels reported in previous
studies is acting as a sounding board where the investor provides strategic advice to the
entrepreneur based on his or her extensive business know-how and management expertise
(Harrison and Mason 1992; Ehrlich et al. 1994; Mason and Harrison 1996; Stevenson and
Coveney 1996; Lumme, Mason, and Suomi 1998; Tashiro 1999; Brettel 2003; Paul, Whittam,
and Johnston 2003; Amatucci and Sohl 2004; Madill, Haines, and Riding 2005). From the
studies that have been reviewed it seems that business angels are likely to be active in this
sounding board/strategic role in a number ways, such as helping to formulate business
strategy, reﬂecting on ideas, enhancing the general pool of available management resources
in the ﬁrm, and giving advice on the manner and timing for how to realize the value that is
created in the ﬁrm. Interestingly, their prior business experience and management know-how
seems to provide an important basis for adding value in the ventures in which they invest
(Wetzel 1994; Mason and Harrison 1996; Politis and Landström 2002). Their involvement
can be related to the infusion of entrepreneurial drive and entrepreneurial values in the
organization based on their extensive experience of working in or in relation to new or
growing ventures (Mason and Harrison 1996). Indeed, business angels often seem to possess
unique personal capabilities that have been developed throughout their careers, which in
turn gives them opportunities to combine a wide set of diverse competencies to generate
ideas and creativity for the realization of entrepreneurial ventures (Van Osnabrugge 1998;
Wright, Westhead, and Sohl 1998; Politis and Landström 2002).
Theoretically, the provision of business know-how and management expertise can be
linked to resource-based arguments, where a ﬁrm’s internal environment – in terms of its

resources and capabilities – is critical for creating sustainable competitive advantage
(Prahalad and Hamel 1990; Barney 1991; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997). A main tenet in
this perspective is that a ﬁrm’s bundle of resources is critical to build competitive
advantage and achieve above average returns. However, long-term competitive advantage

<-----Page 9----->Venture Capital

135

Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:07 23 March 2009

requires that resources should be heterogeneous in nature and not perfectly mobile
(Barney 1991). Smaller ﬁrms are also generally characterized by a lack of internal
resources, and there is often a lack of knowledge in critical management areas such as
ﬁnance and marketing (Shepherd, Douglas, and Shanley 2000; Brush, Green, and Hart,
2001). The business know-how and management expertise provided by experienced
business angels may in this respect be considered as a key strategic resource for the ﬁrm
that is neither perfectly imitable nor easily substitutable, and therefore of great value.
Hence, from the perspective of resource-based theory the personal business know-how and
expertise provided by business angels can be seen as a potential source of competitive
advantage that can improve a ﬁrm’s competitive position.
Supervision and monitoring role
Another value adding role commonly performed by business angels that has been reported
in the literature is their involvement in supervision and monitoring activities (Ehrlich et al.
1994; Lumme, Mason, and Suomi 1998; Sætre 2003). This supervision and monitoring role
is about shielding the investments of the main resource providers of the enterprise (equity
holders, as well as debt holders and employees) from potential managerial misbehaviour
(e.g. the risk that the entrepreneur may mix personal and business goals) (Markman,
Balkin, and Schjoedt 2001; Van Osnabrugge 2000). A common way to perform
supervision and monitoring activities in venture capital-backed ventures is by instituting
proper accounting information systems (Mitchell, Reid, and Terry 1997) and by serving on
the board of directors in the portfolio ﬁrms (Gabrielsson and Huse 2002). These checks
and balances enable business angel investors to oversee operating matters, protect the
assets of the ﬁrm, and hold managers accountable for their actions in order to ensure the
future survival and success of the enterprise.
Business angels’ involvement in the supervision and monitoring role can be linked back
to agency theoretical arguments. According to Jensen and Meckling (1976), the separation
of ownership (residual risk bearing) from day-to-day decision making creates a principal–
agent relationship and induces agency problems between contractual parties. Reduced
managerial ownership means that outside investors (as residual bearers) risk bearing the
costs of decisions that do not maximize their own wealth. Markman, Balkin, and Schjoedt
(2001), for example, argue that managers may have access to superior information
regarding the resources and performance of the enterprise. Consequently, managers can
take advantage of this information asymmetry, consciously or unconsciously, for their
own purposes while reducing the returns of other investors. Business angels thus have
incentives to monitor managerial and ﬁrm performance to avoid non-proﬁt maximizing
activities. To reduce potential agency costs and maximize shareholder value agency theory
prescribes that outside investors should be actively involved in supervision and monitoring
activities (Jensen and Meckling 1976; Van Osnabrugge 2000). In sum, based on agency
theoretic reasoning business angels can be expected to provide added value through their
involvement in a kind of supervision and monitoring role as these activities help to
minimize potential asymmetric information and reduce agency costs.
Resource acquisition role
The majority of business angels seem to be heavily involved in contributing added value by
acquiring timely resources through their personal networks (Harrison and Mason 1992;
Ehrlich et al. 1994; Mason and Harrison 1996; Lumme, Mason, and Suomi 1998;

Ardichvili et al. 2002; Brettel 2003; Paul, Whittam, and Johnston 2003; Sætre 2003;
Amatucci and Sohl 2004; Sørheim 2005). This value adding resource acquisition role can be
related to activities such as interfacing with investor groups, providing important business
contacts and raising additional funds. The networking activities of business angels can be
seen as helpful supporting the early development and growth of new and small ﬁrms, for
example in developing and managing their network of connections with important
stakeholders in the surroundings (Sørheim 2003). Among other things, this makes the
venture better prepared for acting on unexpected opportunities that arise in the marketplace
as they have the necessary information and knowledge about when to act in order to take
advantage of the ‘strategic windows’ that appear (e.g. Harvey and Evans 1995).
The resource acquisition role performed by business angels can be linked to the
resource dependency perspective, which emphasizes that the long-term survival and
success of a ﬁrm is dependent on its abilities to link with its external environment (Pfeﬀer
and Salancik 1978). To reduce resource dependencies the theory argues that ﬁrms should
initiate and maintain control over critical relationships, assets and contacts in the external
environment of the ﬁrm. These arguments ﬁt nicely into the context of new and small
ventures as one of the main obstacles facing small ﬁrms in their early phases of
development is their lack of stable links to important key stakeholders in their
surroundings (Stinchombe 1965; Aldrich and Zimmer 1986). To overcome the internal
lack of resources it is important to rely on the assistance of outside expertise to aid the
growth and development of new and small ﬁrms (Deakins, O’Neill, and Mileham 2000).
The personal networks provided by business angels may in this respect bring legitimacy to
ﬂedgling ventures as well as helping entrepreneurs to get access to critical resources (Steier
and Greenwood 2000; Ardichvili et al. 2002). Based on resource dependency theoretic
reasoning, the value added contribution of business angels can therefore be regarded as a
network-embedded capability.
Mentoring role
The ﬁnal value adding role is the involvement of business angels in mentoring activities,
which refers to a developmental relationship between the more experienced business angel
and the less experienced entrepreneur (Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 1995; Mason and
Harrison 1996; Sætre 2003; Brettel 2003). This role is about being a helpful, open and
trustful partner with the aim to build up a stable and committed working relationship with
the entrepreneur. Reported activities that can be related to the mentoring role include
providing moral support, lifting the spirits, sharing the burden, providing a broader view,
and discussing and dealing with sensitive personal issues. The involvement in these
mentoring activities can support important business operations, such as joint planning and
problem solving based on social and relational means, and they also foster solidarity and
trust. Trust can in this respect lead to improved performance as it economizes on
transactions costs, as well as generating greater commitment and promoting collective
learning (Child and Rodrigues 2003). The mentoring role can thus be considered as highly
important for the development of a well-functioning and trusting relationship between
business angels and entrepreneurs (Wetzel 1994; Harrison, Dibbon, and Mason 1997).
Interestingly, the mentoring role performed by business angels seems to be very much
facilitated by their own entrepreneurial experience as well as the perception of themselves
as entrepreneurs rather than as ﬁnanciers. For example, several studies have revealed that
business angels often have the same personal characteristics and motives (e.g. need for
achievement, locus of control, independence, intrinsic motivation, etc.) as entrepreneurs in

<-----Page 11----->137

Venture Capital

general (Sullivan 1991; Duxbury, Haines, and Riding 1996). In addition, they often have a
genuine background as entrepreneurs (Sullivan 1991; Landström 1993; Duxbury, Haines,
and Riding 1996; Van Osnabrugge 1998; Aernoudt 1999). Previous studies have even
shown that business angels generally still consider themselves as entrepreneurs rather than
ex-entrepreneurs in their subsequent careers as business angels (Sullivan 1991; Aernoudt
1999). Based on these ﬁndings, it seems appropriate to regard business angels as ‘coentrepreneurs’ rather than purely ﬁnanciers of entrepreneurial ventures (Sætre 2003;
Lindsay 2004). The similarity between entrepreneurs and business angels in terms of
personality and way of thinking might in this respect also strengthen the likelihood that
the entrepreneur accepts being guided by the business angel.
Theoretically, the mentoring role performed by business angels can be related to
theories of relational governance (MacNeil 1980; Huse 1993; Grandori 2006). While agency
theorists mainly emphasize formally deﬁned contracts to safeguard equity investments,
relational governance theorists argue for the importance of norm-driven deﬁnitions of
proper behaviour to regulate social relationships and social exchange between economic
actors (Huse 1993). A basic tenet in the relational governance perspective is that any
exchange relies heavily on social components, and that repeated cycles of exchange over
time will create a psychological identity between contracting parties characterized by
shared norms, values and beliefs (e.g. Fergusson et al. (2005); also see similar arguments in
Cable and Shane (1997)). An ongoing functional relationship based on these premises will
generally foster trust and enable parties to build conﬁdence in each other and adopt more
ﬂexible models of partner cooperation (Shepherd and Zacharakis 2001). When there is a
risk of conﬂicting interests in a partnership then relational governance mechanisms become
a necessary and eﬃcient complement to formal contracting mechanisms as they foster
continuance, reciprocity and bilateralism (Macneil 1978). Thus, in a relational governance
perspective business angels contribute with value added through the mentoring role by
instituting a shared vision, mutual understanding and trust in the relationship between the
business angel and the entrepreneur, which in turn has the potential to reduce harmful
conﬂict and promote cohesion and long-term commitment.
Table 2 presents a summary of the four value adding roles together with links to
theoretical perspectives that explain how business angels may add value to their
investee ﬁrms.

Summary: a sorting logic of business angels and value added
Based on this attempt to categorize diﬀerent kinds of value added roles on an aggregated
level (Table 2), it seems reasonable to argue that business angels provide several
complementary value added beneﬁts to their portfolio ﬁrms. At a closer investigation, it
seems possible to further diﬀerentiate the four value added roles along two major
dimensions. First, they diﬀer in their emphasis on value added based on either
constructing a competitive resource base in the ﬁrm (Brush, Green, and Hart 2001) or
governing the working relationship between the business angel and the entrepreneur
(Cable and Shane 1997). This distinction is related to the two systems of any business: the
production system and the governance system (Huse and Gabrielsson 2004). The
production system is focused on the ﬁrm’s management of resources (broadly deﬁned).
The main focus is on attracting and maintaining resources and eﬀectively channelling them
into products and/or services, which ultimately leads to the performance of the ﬁrm. The
governance system, on the other hand, is focused on the relationships and interactions that
allocate rights and responsibilities among the various resource providers of a ﬁrm. Among
other things, the system focuses on the design of particular governance mechanisms to
determine how organizational resources will be deployed and how to deal with the
resolution of conﬂicts between organizational actors who have potentially divergent goals
(Daily, Dalton, and Cannella 2003). In sum, the value added contributions focused on
securing the need for resources in the ﬁrm is the ‘sounding board/strategic role’ and the
‘resource acquisition role’. The value added contributions focused on governing the
relationship between the business angel and the entrepreneur are the ‘supervision and
monitoring role’ and the ‘mentoring role’.
The second dimension is whether the value added role is based on the business angels’
human capital or social capital, both of which can be seen as the personal assets and
qualiﬁcations that business angels have developed throughout their professional careers
(Politis and Landström 2002). Human capital can be deﬁned as the set of productive
knowledge and skills which business angels have acquired through diﬀerent kinds of jobs,
training and experience (Ucbasaran, Wright, and Westhead 2003). Social capital, on the
other hand, can be deﬁned as the advantage created by an individual’s location in a
structure of relationships (Adler and Kwon 2002). In the context of this study, it can be
referred to as the features of the business angels’ relationship networks that mediate norms
and social trust and facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual beneﬁt (Sørheim
2003). In sum, the value added contributions based on business angels’ human capital is
the ability to perform the ‘sounding board/strategic role’ and the ‘supervision and
monitoring role’. The value added contributions based on business angels’ social capital is
the ability to perform the ‘resource acquisition role’ and the interpersonal ‘mentoring role’.
The sorting logic described above is summarized in Figure 1.
It is important to emphasize the interrelationship between the diﬀerent value adding
roles. For example, the resource acquisition role and the sounding board/strategic role are,
for obvious reasons, complementary in the production system of a ﬁrm. The business
angel can use his or her network to secure the supply of external resources that are critical
for ﬁrm operations, as well as using their business know-how as part of the ﬁrm’s bundle
of unique capabilities to provide the basis for its strategy. Similarly, formal and relational
mechanisms of governance can also be seen as complementary to each other as they both
contribute to reducing the risk of opportunism between contracting parties (Huse 1993).
In order to achieve optimal levels of conﬁdence in partner cooperation the entrepreneur
and the business angel need to balance the level of formal monitoring and informal trust
building governance mechanisms (Shepherd and Zacharakis 2001).

Business angels and value added: a sorting logic.

The value adding roles are also interrelated as they are based on business angels’
accumulated human or social capital. To be able to monitor the performance of the
business, the business angel needs to have suﬃcient business know-how and management
expertise. The accumulated human capital which business angels have acquired through
diﬀerent kinds of jobs, training and experience (Politis and Landström 2002) is
consequently supporting both the provision of business know-how and management
expertise through the sounding board/strategic role as well as his or her ability to perform
the supervision and monitoring role. In similar vein, to function as a mentor the business
angel needs to have developed a reputation as a trustworthy and competent
businessperson. The business angels’ accumulated social capital can in this respect serve
as an advantage both in matters of resource acquisition (Sørheim 2003) as well as in
supporting the development of a trusting developmental mentoring relationship with the
entrepreneur (Sætre 2003).
In addition, there are interrelationships across the dimensions. The mentoring role, for
example, can support business angels’ ability to eﬀectively provide business know-how and
management expertise and therefore strengthen the sounding board/strategic role.
Mentoring is about building a trusting developmental relationship and this in turn may
increase the likelihood that the entrepreneur will be more receptive to, and actually use,
the advice given by business angels. For this reason, it can be expected that entrepreneurs
will value the mentorship role, not so much as an informal control mechanism, but for
developing trusting relationships where learning can become routinized through repeated
interaction and shared beliefs over time (Deakins and Freel 1998; Deakins, O’Neill, and
Mileham 2000). On the other hand, the business angel can be expected to place greater
value on the mentoring role, as this can reduce transaction costs and foster noncontractual coordination mechanisms between contracting parties (Noteboom 2000).
Interestingly, this suggests that the diﬀerent parties may experience diﬀerent beneﬁts from
the same role.
There also seem to be interrelationships between the resource acquisition role and the
supervision and monitoring role. Business angels rely to a large extent on friends and
business associates in their social networks to provide them with relevant information for
their investment activities (Fiet 1995; Sørheim 2003). It may therefore be reasonable to
assume that their network can provide them with relevant information about performance
criteria and industry benchmarks that can be used in performance valuations. This, in
turn, suggests that the social networks of business angels can play a role not only in

<-----Page 14----->140

D. Politis

resource acquisition but also in information evaluation, which encourages the circulation
of information between network members (Chaserant 2003).
In sum, based on the discussion above it seems fair to argue that although the four
value adding roles that have been identiﬁed can be seen as distinct, they should also be
seen as complementary and linked to each other. Therefore, it becomes important to be
aware of potential cross fertilizations where the performance of one value adding role may
enhance the eﬀect of another role.

Business angels and value added: where do we go?
The identiﬁcation of diﬀerent value adding roles in Figure 1 together with the associated
discussion provides a conceptual foundation for a better understanding of business angels
and value added. At the same time, the identiﬁcation of the diﬀerent value adding roles
provides a basis for considering where research on these issues may head in the future.
First, an important avenue for future research is to develop robust operationalizations of
business angels’ involvement in the diﬀerent value adding roles. Although considerable
time and energy is required to be invested to develop appropriate measures some
suggestions can be made of how to start this proposed research path.
In order to assess business angels’ involvement in the sounding board/strategic role
researchers could look at existing operationalizations used in studies of business advice
given to small ﬁrms (e.g. Bennett and Robson 2003; Gooderham et al. 2004). For business
angels’ involvement in the supervision and monitoring role, researchers could be inspired
by measures of control activities used in research on boards and governance in new and
small ﬁrms (e.g. Gabrielsson 2007). In addition to ﬁnancial controls, such as following up
net income, the return on assets and sales, these measures should also include strategic
controls relevant for new and small ﬁrms, such as product quality checks, customer
satisfaction, new patent registrations, success in meeting target dates, etc. Furthermore,
business angels’ involvement in the resource acquisition role could be gauged by
measuring their ability to mobilize resources relevant for ﬁrm operations. These activities
could look at studies which have measured networking activities such as establishing
contact with important parts of the environment, raising capital, inﬂuencing important
parts of the environment, recruiting labour, identifying and ﬁnding customers, as well as
accessing timely support from business colleagues (e.g. Borch and Huse 1993; Fadahunsi,
Smallbone, and Supri 2000). Finally, researchers could draw on studies that add
dimensions of interdependence and trust in developing business relationships to assess the
mentoring role. One suggestion is the measures used by Huse (1993, 1994) which were
based on Macneil’s (1980) theories of relational norms to emphasize that individual action
must be understood in a social context. To conclude, there are several studies that can
serve as sources of inspiration to develop appropriate measures of business angels’
involvement in the diﬀerent value adding roles. This is a fundamental task in order to
enable empirical research on business angels and value added to be validated and
compared across diﬀerent contexts.
Second, perhaps the most crucial and important question in research on business
angels and value added is the eﬀect of their hands-on involvement on the performance of
the business. Do their value added contributions actually matter, and what kinds of value
added contribution matter the most? This question will require that business angels’
involvement in various roles is linked to ﬁrm performance. Unfortunately, it is not exactly
clear what ﬁrm performance means when dealing with new and small ﬁrms or how to ﬁnd
appropriate operational deﬁnitions. In entrepreneurship research it is common to use

<-----Page 15----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:07 23 March 2009

Venture Capital

141

economic measures of ﬁrm performance, such as eﬃciency, growth or proﬁt (Murphy,
Trailer, and Hill 1996). However, as shown by Murphy, Trailer, and Hill (1996) an eﬀect
on one performance dimension cannot justify that the eﬀect is similar across other
measures of ﬁnancial performance. For example, a growth in sales can be achieved at the
cost of reduced ﬁrm proﬁtability.3 Therefore it is highly unlikely that the use of only one
single measure of ﬁrm performance could suﬃciently capture the eﬀect of business angels’
hands-on involvement. In addition to this potential pitfall, it can also be diﬃcult to
accurately estimate the performance of new and small ﬁrms entirely on the basis of
accounting measures (Petit and Singer 1985). The reason for this is that these measures can
be highly inﬂuenced by regional or industry variations in accountancy practices (e.g.
depreciation policies and inventory evaluation principles), and are also subject to
managerial manipulation due to ‘creative’ tax-avoiding accounting practices. Hence, in
addition to ﬁnancial measures there may also be a need to include other performance
measures that are relevant for new and small ﬁrms, such as new product success (Khavul
2001), marketing and sales eﬀectiveness (Hill 2001), harvest/exit readiness (Higashide and
Birley 2002) or ﬁrm survival (Manigart, Baeyens, and Van Hyfte 2002). Subjective
measures of ﬁrm performance and measures that seek to combine personal and economic
measures of success (Jarvis et al. 2000; Pelham 1997; van Gelderen, Frese, and Thurik
2000) could also be considered. In sum, future research on business angels and value added
should include a wide range of theoretically relevant performance criteria when empirically
testing for the eﬀect of business angels’ hands-on involvement on the performance of the
business. Given the expectations that business angels contribute to the future survival and
success of the businesses they invest in this research path should be a number one research
priority.
Third, the identiﬁcation of diﬀerent value adding roles in Figure 1 is fundamentally
static and does not consider that business angels’ emphasis on performing diﬀerent roles
may vary and change depending on various conditions. However, the identiﬁcation of
diﬀerent value adding roles highlights this question of how the business angels’ emphasis
on various roles will change during the development of a venture. For example, it is likely
that there is a ‘honeymoon’ period at the beginning of the relationship (Fichman and
Levinthal 1991), characterized by high commitment and individual eﬀort by the business
angel. This period may then turn into a period where the business angel reduces his or her
involvement and takes a less active hands-on role when the ﬁrst emotional excitement
drops. However, what may trigger changes in business angels’ involvement, and how these
changes aﬀect the value added roles performed by the business angel remain unclear. At
best, future research on this issue will be facilitated by samples of business angels who have
made investments at diﬀerent time periods. This would allow for the isolation of their
more immediate post-investment attitudes and activities from their long-term postinvestment strategies.
Fourth, it is also important to consider whether the growth of business angel groups
will have any eﬀect on the value added contribution of business angels. Even if solo
investors dominate the informal venture capital market there is evidence indicating that
more organized groups of business angel syndicates are developing (Sohl, Van
Osnabrugge, and Robinson 2003; Mason 2006). According to Mason (2006, 285), these
angel groups have the potential to create some advantages such as a better deal ﬂow,
superior evaluation and due diligence, and a greater likelihood that their subsequent
involvement will contribute with signiﬁcant value added. This latter advantage is due to
the greater pool of experience, advice and strategic services that an organized group of
business angels can provide. However, the question of the value adding eﬀect of business

<-----Page 16----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:07 23 March 2009

142

D. Politis

angel groups is still largely unexplored and unanswered and requires further investigation,
involving detailed comparisons between solo investors and business angel groups.
Fifth, inspired by the work of Zahra and George (2002), there may be a need to
distinguish between potential value added and realized value added. The underlying
argument for this distinction is that just because business angels (or business angel groups)
have the potential to contribute with added value it does not mean that this value can be
eﬀectively implemented and used in a new venture. Potential value added would here refer
to the set of potential beneﬁts that a new venture can receive from a business angel. The
realized value added will, on the other hand, refer to the successful implementation and
incorporation of the hands-on contribution provided by a business angel in the venture’s
operations, thereby improving its performance. Previous studies have almost completely
neglected this diﬀerence even though this line of reasoning may have important
implications for the way we should understand the value added contribution of business
angels. Hence, instead of treating value added as a simple transferring process the
distinction suggests that people and organizations can vary signiﬁcantly in their ability to
eﬀectively implement and utilize the potential value adding beneﬁts that business angels
can provide (Cohen and Levinthal 1990). Making a distinction between potential and
realized value added in future research can thus allow researchers to study why some
attempts to contribute added value fail while others thrive, given apparently similar
conditions. This avenue of research may call for a contingency approach (Donaldson
2001; Robinson and McDougall 2001), which would emphasize that the diﬀerence between
potential and realized value added may be contingent upon conditions in the internal and
external environment of the new venture. Examples of inﬂuencing factors may be the life
cycle stage of the business (Churchill and Lewis 1983), the career experience and team
tenure of the entrepreneurial team (Barney et al. 1996), or characteristics of the industry
where the ﬁrm operates (Sandberg and Hofer 1987). In sum, how the value added
contribution of business angels may be inﬂuenced by diﬀerent conditions in the internal or
external environment of the venture is an issue that is of great relevance to consider. This,
in turn, may enhance the scholarly understanding of the process in which their potential
value added contributions can become eﬀectively implemented and incorporated in the
ventures in which they invest.
Many of the research questions addressed above may require diﬀerent approaches
from those commonly used in the ﬁeld so far. Studies of business angels and value added
have primarily been conducted using postal questionnaires and have been largely
descriptive with very limited theoretical grounding. While large-scale postal questionnaires
can be considered appropriate when the focus is on gaining a broad overview knowledge
of the characteristics of the market and its actors, this approach is much less suited for
developing theory of the value added activities informal investors perform in the postinvestment phase. Future studies of business angels and value added should therefore
consider making use of more theory-building case studies (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2003) to
further explore the value added beneﬁts of informal investors, before large-scale empirical
investigations can be made.
Conclusions
This paper contributes to literature and research on business angels in two important
ways. First, it provides a systematic overview of previous literature and research on
business angels and value added. Despite considerable interest in the value added activities
of formal venture capital organizations (e.g. Gorman and Sahlman 1989; MacMillan,

<-----Page 17----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 23:07 23 March 2009

Venture Capital

143

Kulow, and Kholyian 1989; Sapienza 1992; Busenitz, Fiet, and Moesel 2004) the same
attention has been less evident in studies of informal venture capital. This is unfortunate
considering the critical importance of the added value performed for both business angels
and entrepreneurs (De Clerq et al. 2006). Second, the paper presents a set of distinct but
complementary value adding roles that business angels have been reported to perform
together with links to theoretical perspectives that explain why these roles have the
potential to contribute with added value. Up to date, empirical reports have been scattered
throughout a broad number of studies and the theoretical underpinnings of what business
angels do and how they add value have been relatively weak. There has been a lack of
theory informing the issue of business angels and value added.
The post-investment phase is one of the most under-researched areas in the study of
business angels. This calls for intensiﬁed studies and further theory development. The
empirical and theoretical arguments underlying the four diﬀerent value adding roles
identiﬁed here can provide a stimulus for additional research and debate on the issue
which might add new perspectives to the existing research agenda on the involvement of
business angels in the post-investment phase. Future research on this important ﬁeld of
inquiry is consequently highly warranted.

The deﬁnition of business angels varies signiﬁcantly in the literature (Kelly 2007). In this study I
have used this broad deﬁnition in order to be able to capture the phenomenon of value added as
widely as possible. Although this may compromise the rigidity of the ﬁndings this choice was
considered satisfactory, given the exploratory aim and purpose of the study.
Even if it is generally acknowledged that business angels are value adding investors who play a
vital role for the development of new ventures it is important to point out that not all research
agrees with the generality of this statement. Hence, although it can be assumed the larger
majority of business angels have the potential to add value to their portfolio ﬁrms through their
hands-on involvement scholars should equally be aware that this ability could diﬀer depending
on their prior management and entrepreneurial experience and the type of involvement that
usually is performed (e.g. Sørheim and Landström 2001).
Growth in sales generally requires capital investments, which can have a negative impact on ﬁrm
eﬃciency/liquidity (Murphy, Trailer, and Hill 1996).
