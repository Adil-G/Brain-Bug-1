Entrepreneurship is a relatively young field; nonetheless, the research in this domain has
been growing at an impressive rate in recent decades. As is commonly the case with
emerging fields, entrepreneurship research currently faces a number of opportunities and
challenges. Overall, entrepreneurship has an opportunity to establish itself as a field
whose methodological rigor matches that of neighboring fields such as organizational
behavior and strategic management, but some key challenges stand in the way of
completing this endeavor. Herein, we outline the challenges that emerged from an
informal survey of editorial board members of Organizational Research Methods (ORM)
about the state of entrepreneurship research methods. We then discuss how the articles
included in the feature topic on research methods in entrepreneurship hold great promises
for resolving these challenges.

T

he entrepreneurship field centers on understanding how new ventures are conceived,
funded, and executed to exploit created or recognized opportunities. As do scholars
in all fields, entrepreneurship researchers seek to develop knowledge in rigorous ways that
withstand scientific scrutiny. As with the entrepreneurs referenced in Vidal Sassoon’s
quote, many entrepreneurship scholars have worked hard over the last few decades to establish their field as a respected peer alongside neighboring fields such as organizational behavior and strategic management.

By some metrics, entrepreneurship scholars have been very successful in building their
field. For example, Busenitz et al. (2003) found that the presence of entrepreneurship articles in seven major organizational journals increased by 62% from the mid-1980s to the end
of the 1990s. One interpretation of these data is that entrepreneurship research has become a
stronger player over time with regard to contributing to the organizational sciences and that,
increasingly, entrepreneurship research compares favorably to that of peer fields.
Two leading entrepreneurship journals—Journal of Business Venturing (JBV) and
Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice (ETP)—are listed among the 30 journals that the
Financial Times uses to rank business schools in terms of their scholarly achievements.
In 2007, the Strategic Management Society introduced its first new journal in nearly 40
years—the Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal—in recognition of the scholarly opportunities presented by the entrepreneurship field. The approaches to entrepreneurship journals
taken by the Financial Times and the Strategic Management Society suggest that these
thought leaders view the entrepreneurship field as very important and as a key element
of the organizational sciences.
Other metrics regarding entrepreneurship research tell a less rosy tale. Although Busenitz
et al. (2003) found that the presence of entrepreneurship articles in leading organizational
journals grew over time, they also found that entrepreneurship accounted for less than 2% of
the total numbers of articles. Meanwhile, 2008 data from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) reveal that the journal impact scores achieved by leading entrepreneurship
journals (JBV ¼ 2.143; ETP ¼ 1.526) currently lag those of leading field-specific journals
within strategic management (Strategic Management Journal ¼ 3.344), industrial organization psychology/organizational behavior (Journal of Applied Psychology ¼ 3.769), human
resource management (Personnel Psychology ¼ 3.222), and research methods (Organizational Research Methods [ORM] ¼ 3.019). One interpretation of the Busenitz et al.
(2003) and ISI data is that entrepreneurship research has yet to become a full contributor
to the organizational sciences as a whole. In this sense, it appears that entrepreneurship
researchers’ hard work has yet to deliver complete success in establishing credibility for
entrepreneurship research that equals the credibility enjoyed by neighboring fields.
These facts could lead one to the premise that work lies ahead in order for the entrepreneurship field to achieve full credibility among the adherents of more established fields.
This premise is certainly debatable, and we expect it to be greeted with doubt and perhaps
scorn in some quarters. However, if we accept the premise, the next issue to consider is what
work is needed to enhance entrepreneurship’s standing among the other organizational
sciences. Efforts to further develop a field of study can roughly be divided into efforts to
enhance the field’s theory and efforts to enhance the field’s methods. The latter is the focus
of this feature topic. The recent content analysis of methods in entrepreneurship studies by
Dean, Shook, and Payne (2007) suggested that the field has a number of areas where
improvement is needed. This is a significant concern because confidence in the conclusions
drawn from research within a field can only be strong if sound methodological practices
underlie the research (Ketchen, Boyd, & Bergh, 2008).
Our primary goal in assembling this feature topic was to identify a set of articles that
collectively could help lay a foundation for methodological improvement within the
entrepreneurship field and thereby would enhance confidence in the findings the field generates. To gain a sense of how methodological experts view research methodology in

<-----Page 3----->8 Organizational Research Methods

entrepreneurship, we surveyed the editorial board members of ORM. We use their comments as a backdrop to describe how the articles in this feature topic have the potential
to close gaps in the literature, and how the techniques the authors’ offer respond to concerns
the experts expressed.

Methods Experts’ Views on Entrepreneurship Research
When proposing this feature topic, our expectation was that leading scholars from other
fields likely view methods in entrepreneurship research with a degree of skepticism. To
examine our suspicion, we were inspired by Meyer (1991), who interviewed prominent strategic management researchers about what they believed was their field’s distinctive competence. Specifically, we asked members of the ORM editorial board to respond to a
small set of open-ended questions regarding their perceptions of methods used in completing entrepreneurship research. We also asked them to identify their ‘‘home’’ field (but not
their identity) when answering the questions. Our targeting of the ORM board reflects our
belief that the board consists of accomplished methodological experts.
We first asked the board to characterize the overall quality and rigor of methods in entrepreneurship. Several respondents were quite blunt in asserting that entrepreneurship methods leave much to be desired. Opinions included ‘‘very poor,’’ ‘‘could be better!’’ and
‘‘quite low.’’ Other respondents offered a more tempered approach. One noted ‘‘I would
characterize the rigor as highly variable. There is a wide range of quality levels in articles
published in this area.’’ Another board member described the state of entrepreneurship
methods as ‘‘satisfactory. It is a relatively new field, and thus valid and reliable measures
of various constructs are required.’’ None of our respondents described research methods
within the entrepreneurship field with a stronger endorsement than ‘‘satisfactory.’’
We next asked board members how entrepreneurship methods compare relative to methods in their ‘‘home’’ fields. Most of the respondents emphasized that entrepreneurship
research compares ‘‘poorly’’ or ‘‘very poorly’’ to their home fields. Several board members
elaborated on their concerns. A self-described macro-organizational behavior–human
resource management scholar asserted that the ‘‘usual standards about validity and reliability seen in micro areas (i.e., HR and OB) and increasingly seen in macro areas (most notably, strategy) are not typically upheld within entrepreneurship inquiry.’’ An organizational
behavior researcher suggested ‘‘quite frankly, [entrepreneurship research is] 10 years
behind strategy which until recently was 10 years behind OB & HR. The good news is the
learning curve is a lot quicker now.’’ Similarly, two other organizational behavior researchers contended that ‘‘from my limited exposure, it appears that there is somewhat less rigor,
which may in part be due to data collection being more difficult than in OB’’ and that ‘‘the
methodology is far behind that which is used in more ‘developed’ management areas.’’
A few respondents noted important areas where entrepreneurship appears to offer positive features relative to other organizational sciences. An industrial-organization psychologist suggested that entrepreneurship research is ‘‘less technical, possibly more relevant’’
than work in his or her field. Similarly, an organizational behavior researcher noted ‘‘it
seems that often research in organizational behavior focuses more on statistical significance
rather than practical utility. Those individuals studying entrepreneurship tend to focus on

9

issues that may be more interesting to practitioners than to academics.’’ The reflections
offered by these respondents highlight that all fields have strengths and weaknesses and that
these strengths and weaknesses vary across fields. Ideally, researchers design their studies
in ways that leverage the strengths offered by their own field as well as those of neighboring
fields.
We next asked respondents about the specific strengths and weaknesses of entrepreneurship research. In discussing strengths, respondents focused on the relative richness of entrepreneurship data. One noted, for example, that ‘‘interviews are leveraged more successfully
than in other areas of the organizational sciences.’’ Another indicated ‘‘on the qualitative
side, I see great potential to gain insights into the minds of entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurship process.’’ A third scholar suggested that, within entrepreneurship research ‘‘the
qualitative data are the most interesting and useful.’’ A fourth acknowledged that entrepreneurship research offers ‘‘more interesting qualitative data’’ than most other fields but cautioned that entrepreneurship generally lacks a ‘‘systematic approach to them.’’ Increased
reliance on prominent guides to qualitative research such as Lincoln and Guba (1985), Yin
(2003), Gephart (2004), and Miles and Huberman (1994) could remedy such mixed
impressions.
In terms of weaknesses, a variety was mentioned. One respondent noted, ‘‘issues surrounding non-response seem to be more prevalent and of concern in entrepreneurship
research than in other areas.’’ A second lamented, ‘‘the lack of sophisticated measuring
techniques and the non-utility of archival methods’’ within entrepreneurship. A third
observed, ‘‘more attention to the criterion appears necessary; closely defining methodologically what successful entrepreneurship entails appears crucial.’’ Another respondent
adopted a gestalt approach, noting ‘‘on the quantitative side, I see problems across the
board.’’
One consistent theme that emerged centered on sampling issues. One respondent
expressed sympathy that ‘‘the study of entrepreneurship poses some unique challenges that
may make it more difficult to get manuscripts published in top journals. Small sample sizes
within organizations and industries make obtaining data that permits typical statistical analyses more difficult.’’ A second respondent echoed these sentiments when noting ‘‘I think
sampling is a particular problem in entrepreneurship research because of two interrelated
issues: The base rate of ‘successful’ entrepreneurship is probably quite low. If this assertion
holds, there are substantial numbers of would-be entrepreneurs who fail to reach a recognizable level of achievement that would lead to their inclusion in a study. Working together,
these low base rate and sample selection problems may interfere in really understanding the
underlying processes.’’ A third observed that when conducting entrepreneurship research,
‘‘the population is difficult to identify, and thus sampling is a problem.’’ Another commented that ‘‘a fundamental problem/tension I see is that samples are usually very small.’’ She
or he aptly noted that this problem ‘‘calls for the need to use creative methods and not necessarily import methods typically used in other areas in which sample size is much larger.’’
Lastly, we provided an opportunity for board members to offer any other observations
they have developed about research methods in entrepreneurship. In response, they presented a mix of caution and encouragement to us. In terms of the former, respondents suggested that ‘‘people in the field need better training in research methods and statistics’’ and
that ‘‘this is an exciting area but more scientific rigor is needed.’’ These assertions may

<-----Page 5----->10 Organizational Research Methods

appear harsh, but their substance is consistent with the findings of Dean et al. (2007) that
many newly minted entrepreneurship PhDs believe that they possess an inadequate skill
level with regard to prominent techniques. Arguably, scholars who have recently completed
their studies possess greater methodological competencies than do scholars in general
(Shook, Ketchen, Cycyota, & Crockett, 2003), suggesting that perhaps the findings of Dean
et al. (2007) can be reasonably generalized to the field as a whole. Another respondent contended that ‘‘this special issue in ORM will go a long way to helping improve the methods
in entrepreneurship—providing the current researchers in the field will read it!’’ Certainly
the publication of a feature topic is not an effective substitute for in-depth training; nonetheless, we are hopeful that this forum will help advance the state of entrepreneurship
methods.
Respondents also offered encouragement. One urged those in the entrepreneurship field
to ‘‘keep researching! Despite the problems of quantitative data collection and analysis in
this field, it is very important.’’ Indeed, concepts such as new venture creation and opportunities that are central to entrepreneurship are also key ingredients throughout the organizational sciences. Simply put, without entrepreneurship, there would be no businesses for
other fields to study. Because today’s firms are a product of yesterday’s entrepreneurial success stories, scholars within all organizational sciences need to understand and sometimes
draw on entrepreneurship ideas to accurately capture organizational processes and
outcomes.
In line with this evolutionary theme, another respondent indicated that entrepreneurship
offers ‘‘a good opportunity to focus on longitudinal research.’’ Another cautioned, however,
that ‘‘organizational realities change with the times and talking about entrepreneurship from
archival data 20 years ago doesn’t really address what entrepreneurship is today.’’ A third
offered encouragement via an evolutionary view of the entrepreneurship field itself. Specifically, she or he noted ‘‘entrepreneurship, as a younger field, first tried to simply export
methods from other, more established, disciplines. But, the time has come for entrepreneurship to develop/adapt methods that will be more suitable for entrepreneurship’s research
realities. Now that entrepreneurship has legitimacy as a discipline, the time has come to propose and use methodological approaches that can be particularly suitable for this field.’’
Similarly, another board member noted ‘‘researchers should use tools and techniques that
will really bring out a deeper understanding and appreciation about entrepreneurial work
as it is enacted in practice and in thought.’’ We believe that many of the works contained
in the feature topic answer these calls, and we hope you will agree.
Our survey was not a scientific effort, but the responses to our questions appear to offer
important implications nevertheless. One important implication is that entrepreneurship
scholars may face a proverbial ‘‘uphill climb’’ when submitting empirical research to premier journals that draw submissions from a variety of organizational sciences (i.e., ‘‘general
management’’ journals). In our experience, editors of these journals attempt to assign a set
of reviewers that collectively possess a broad array of relevant skills. As such, an article
would seldom be assigned only to individuals whose own research is focused exclusively
on entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship scholars must therefore expect their work to be
judged by discipline-wide empirical standards, which in some cases may be more demanding than those in the entrepreneurship field. This may help explain, for example, the fact
that entrepreneurship research historically has appeared less frequently in the Academy

11

of Management Journal than might be anticipated (cf., Ireland, Reutzel, & Webb, 2005).
Our hope is that the methodological advances provided in this feature topic will facilitate
stronger entrepreneurship research methods and, ultimately, greater regard for such methods from leading scholars in neighboring fields.

The Feature Topic Articles
We are pleased to offer nine articles in this feature topic; each of which provides important contributions toward enhancing entrepreneurship methods. The purpose of Lohrke,
Holloway, and Woolley in ‘‘Conjoint Analysis in Entrepreneurship Research: A Review
and Research Agenda’’ is to advocate for an important technique for understanding decision
making that is commonly applied to study consumers’ purchase decisions within marketing
research. Conjoint analysis involves asking respondents to make a decision wherein all of
the pertinent criteria for making the decision are preset by the researchers. The technique
allows researchers to see how respondents make trade offs among key criteria while they
are actually making decisions, which avoids the threat of retrospective bias.
As our survey of ORM’s editorial board indicated, entrepreneurship researchers have
sometimes been slow to adopt rigorous techniques from other disciplines, and the review
by Lohrke et al. shows that this appears to be the case for conjoint analysis, despite the fact
that decision making is clearly central throughout the entrepreneurial process. One exception is that the technique has been used to study venture capitalists’ investments. To spur the
further adoption of conjoint analysis, Lohrke et al. briefly and clearly lay out what conjoint
analysis is and how it differs from other data-gathering methods that are more familiar to
entrepreneurship researchers. Importantly, after a review of conjoint analysis’s use in entrepreneurship research, they offer a number of ideas for fruitfully expanding its use beyond
venture capitalists’ decision making.
Our survey of the ORM review board identified unsophisticated measurement techniques
and inadequate sample sizes as two important challenges confronting entrepreneurship
researchers. The article ‘‘Using Experience Sampling Methodology to Advance Entrepreneurship Theory and Research’’ by Uy, Foo, and Aguinis offers an elegant solution. The
authors describe a cost-effective technique for using cellular phones to gather ongoing,
real-time information from entrepreneurs. The technique offers great hope for helping to
understand how entrepreneurs feel and what they are thinking as they move through different phases of the entrepreneurial process. Also, because the unit of analysis is the point in
time, and not the entrepreneur, small numbers of entrepreneurs generate large numbers of
observations. These greater sample sizes are likely to be viewed positively by journal
reviewers grounded in other organizational science domains.
As one of the ORM editorial review board members noted, at some point, entrepreneurship research needs to adapt or develop methods from other areas to accommodate the
field’s unique challenges. One widely recognized challenge is measuring the concept of
‘‘opportunity’’ (Alvarez & Barney, 2007). The article ‘‘Measuring Arbitrage Opportunities:
A Minimum Performance Inefficiency Estimation Technique’’ by Anokhin, Troutt, Wincent, and Brandyberry adapts a technique from operations research to measure Kirznerian
opportunities. In contrast to Schumpeterian or ‘‘innovative’’ opportunities that involve new

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 7----->12 Organizational Research Methods

resource combinations, Kirznerian opportunities reflect the gap between how an entrepreneurial firm uses resources relative to the way that the best firms use theirs. Anokhin et al.
explain minimum performance inefficiency (MPI) estimation and its advantages for measuring gaps between what a firm is doing and what could be done by mirroring leaders’
resource allocation decisions. Such a measure can build understanding of why some entrepreneurs and not others attempt to close Kirznerian opportunity gaps. It could also be used
to discover how the size of Kirznerian gaps might influence other behavior, such as start-up
activity, industry exit, or the amount of Schumpeterian innovation.
Several ORM board members noted the potential of qualitative research to develop
insights into entrepreneurial processes. The article ‘‘The Philosophy and Practice of Interpretivist Research in Entrepreneurship: Quality, Validation and Trust’’ by Leitch, Hill, and
Harrison provides thoughts on how to approach qualitative research questions in entrepreneurship while maintaining the elements of rigor needed to move the field forward. When
conducting interpretivist research, they encourage researchers to consider validation as a
process rather than an outcome. Ethical and substantive validation must occur in each of
the design, analysis, and interpretation stages of research. Doing so will ensure adequate
rigor and quality in nonpositivistic approaches, helping ensure that a diverse set of perspectives are applied to key entrepreneurship research questions.
The article ‘‘Idea Sets: Conceptualizing and Measuring a New Unit of Analysis in Entrepreneurship Research’’ by Hill and Birkinshaw addresses an ORM board member’s encouragement to ‘‘use tools and techniques that will really bring out a deeper understanding and
appreciation about entrepreneurial work as it is enacted in practice and in thought.’’ Their
article provides a novel means to gain insight into entrepreneurs’ thought processes by proposing the concept of idea sets—the total inventory of entrepreneurial ideas an individual
can access in their memory at a given point in time. This concept builds on a rich history
that considers an understanding of opportunities to be central to the entrepreneurship field
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). The work by Hill and Birkinshaw also highlights a new
unit of analysis that promises to enhance understanding of the processes that lead to opportunity recognition, and it provides concrete guidelines to operationalize idea sets.
Grégoire, Shepherd, and Lambert provide a valuable tool for measuring entrepreneurial
thought processes in ‘‘Measuring Opportunity-Recognition Beliefs: Illustrating and Validating an Experimental Approach.’’ Their approach incorporates both qualitative and quantitative data, and leverages varied techniques such as content analysis and confirmatory
factor analysis. From a methods perspective, their article responds to concerns about validity highlighted in previous assessments of entrepreneurship research (e.g., Chandler &
Lyon, 2001). Of equal importance, their article illustrates research tasks that simulate
real-life events of entrepreneurs as they recognize opportunities. Overall, the work by Grégoire et al. provides techniques that move the field closer to understanding the unique
thought processes of entrepreneurs in a manner consistent with strong scientific rigor.
In keeping with the notion that, as one ORM board member puts it, ‘‘the time has come to
propose and use methodological approaches that can be particularly suitable for this field,’’
two articles in the feature topic focus on helping researchers deal with two highly related
aspects of how geographic space affects entrepreneurship research. Plummer’s article entitled ‘‘Spatial Dependence in Entrepreneurship Research: Challenges and Methods’’ shows
how researchers can deal with spatial dependence, which occurs because observations of

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 8----->Short et al. / Research Methods in Entrepreneurship

13

entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial ventures located in close proximity are not independent.
They share and are similarly shaped by the same cultural, institutional, and competitive
environments, which creates dependence among observations and thereby biases ordinary
least squares estimations. Plummer’s article demonstrates the use of a set of tools that leverage observations’ locations to test whether spatial dependence is a problem and, if so, to
statistically correct the resultant error. Doing so is important even in research contexts
where theory under investigation is not concerned with geography, per se.
In the second article about geography, ‘‘Dealing with Spatial Heterogeneity in Entrepreneurship Research,’’ Breitenecker and Harms demonstrate the use of a technique called
geographical weighted regression (GWR) for coping with the fact that many of the relationships of interest to entrepreneurship researchers vary across geographic regions. Like Plummer, these authors explain why spatial heterogeneity is important and describe how
researchers can test to see if it is a factor in their data. However, the focus of Breitenecker
and Harms is on spatial heterogeneity rather than dependence. Whereas dependence is concerned with the potential for nearby observations to violate regression assumptions by creating dependence, spatial heterogeneity is focused on understanding how relationships of
interest differ from region to region. Breitenecker and Harms demonstrate the potential
effect of spatial heterogeneity by showing how the predictors of start-up activity in Austria
vary in different regions of the country. Over time, techniques such as GWR should help
entrepreneurship researchers discover institutional and cultural factors that affect the
importance of antecedents to key outcomes such as entrepreneurial intention and start-up
activity.
In the last article in the feature topic, Crook, Shook, Morris, and Madden bring us full
circle by assessing where we are methodologically as a field and pointing toward where
progress is most needed. Using a two-study design, they ask the important question: ‘‘Are
We There Yet? An Assessment of Research Design and Construct Measurement Practices
in Entrepreneurship Research.’’ In the first study, the authors update the review of research
design and measurement issues in entrepreneurship by Chandler and Lyon (2001). They
conclude that, overall, the field’s methodological rigor has made significant strides. In particular, improvements in construct measurement and the use of more sophisticated modeling approaches were found. In the second study, Crook et al. surveyed the editors, associate
editors, and board members of JBV and ETP. These entrepreneurship experts noted a number of areas wherein gaps between the field’s current state and the ideal state remain. Some
of the largest gaps involve common method bias, nonresponse bias, fit between design and
method, reliability, and validity. Overall, the article provides evidence that ‘‘we are not
there yet.’’ In line with our introductory quote, important successes have been achieved, but
much work remains.

Conclusion
Research methods within entrepreneurship possess key strengths, and also are confronted
by important opportunities and challenges. We believe that the articles included in the feature topic on research methods in entrepreneurship offer clear and actionable guidance for
addressing many of the field’s needs. Looking to the future, we have two main aspirations in

Downloaded from http://orm.sagepub.com at UNIV OF WATERLOO on December 3, 2009

<-----Page 9----->14 Organizational Research Methods

relation to the feature topic. First, we are optimistic that the work offered herein will
enhance the rigor of subsequent entrepreneurship research. Second, we hope that the
appearance of this feature topic within ORM will inspire entrepreneurship researchers to
make additional methodological contributions in future issues of the journal. If both of these
aspirations are met, entrepreneurship research would have made significant strides toward
establishing methodological standards that compare favorably with those of other organizational sciences.
