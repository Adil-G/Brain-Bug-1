Aspects of Endowment: A Query Theory of Value Construction

How do people judge the monetary value of objects? One clue is provided by the typical endowment
study (D. Kahneman, J. L. Knetsch, & R. H. Thaler, 1991), in which participants are randomly given
either a good, such as a coffee mug, that they may later sell (“sellers”) or a choice between the good and
amounts of cash (“choosers”). Sellers typically demand at least twice as much as choosers, inconsistent
with economic theory. This result is usually explained by an increased weighting of losses, or loss
aversion. The authors provide a memory-based account of endowment, suggesting that people construct
values by posing a series of queries whose order differs for sellers and choosers. Because of output
interference, these queries retrieve different aspects of the object and the medium of exchange, producing
different valuations. The authors show that the content and structure of the recalled aspects differ for
selling and choosing and that these aspects predict valuations. Merely altering the order in which queries
are posed can eliminate the endowment effect, and changing the order of queries can produce
endowment-like effects without ownership.
Keywords: decision making, preference construction, loss aversion, endowment effect

decreases in the objective value of an attribute have more influence
on valuation and choice than equivalent increases in objective
value. In the endowment effect, the reference point is the current
state of affairs, and the good represents either a gain or a loss. Loss
aversion is a major premise of prospect theory and is used as a
basis for explanations of many decision phenomena. These include
why the framing of options influences choices (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981), how the addition of irrelevant options affects choice
(Simonson & Tversky, 1992), why there are differences in organ
donation rates across countries (Johnson & Goldstein, 2003) and
differences in retirement savings with different defaults (Madrian
& Shea, 2001), and why people do not sell stocks that have gone
down in value (Shefrin & Statman, 1985; see Kahneman & Tversky, 2000, for a review).
The endowment effect illustrates how the strategies used in
evaluating simple objects have significant economic consequences. For example, this result challenges the Coase theorem, an
important assumption in the economic analysis of social welfare
and political economy, which suggests that the value of an object
is independent of initial ownership (Kahneman et al., 1990). Despite its importance, empirical robustness, and explanatory power,
there is only a limited amount of research on, and little agreement
about, the psychological mechanisms underlying the endowment
effect, particularly as compared with the number of empirical
demonstrations of the effect.
Two other candidate accounts, often suggested by skeptical
economists, are strategic misrepresentation and wealth effects.
The strategic misrepresentation account suggests that participants
think they are making opening offers much like starting positions
in a negotiation rather than stating their true valuation of the good.
To control for this possibility, experimenters use a standard
method in experimental economics (see Becker, DeGroot, & Mar-

The endowment effect (Kahneman & Tversky, 2000) represents
a severe challenge to views of the “rational” decision maker—
assumed by economics—and to psychology’s ability to explain
deviations from that standard. In the typical endowment study
(Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1990, 1991), half of all participants are randomly given a good such as a coffee mug. All
participants then partake in a market in which the experimenter
offers to buy the mug from those who got one and to sell a mug to
those who did not. The typical result is that those who have
received a mug value it 2 to 3 times more than those who did not.
Thus, the value of an object depends on ownership, even when that
ownership is assigned randomly.
The most common psychological characterization of the endowment effect is loss aversion, which describes and summarizes two
phenomena: First, valuations depend on a reference point; second,

schak, 1964, or “BDM”), which provides respondents with an
incentive for truthful revelation of their value for a good. Participants must indicate, for each of a number of amounts of money
(i.e., possible market prices), whether they would prefer the mug
or the money. The experimenter then announces the market price,
which was determined a priori, and completes transactions with
participants according to what they stated to be their preference at
that price. Reporting anything other than their true value costs
participants money. To control for wealth effects, experimenters
have contrasted two equivalent decisions with different frames:
Selling prices (for those who are given a mug) and choices between money and the object (for those who are not). These controls
have become standard in research on the endowment effect (Kahneman et al., 1991), but Plott and Zeiler (2005) have recently
argued that it is a misunderstanding of the incentive procedure, and
not loss aversion, that accounts for the endowment effect. The
experiments we report in this article include controls for both
wealth effects and strategic misrepresentation, and they allow tests
for understanding of the task.
A more psychological class of explanations suggest that buying
and selling shift the decision maker’s focus of attention, consistent
with the notion that most evaluations are sensitive to implicit goals
(Fischer, Carmon, Ariely, & Zauberman, 1999), or that the relative
weights attached to different features of an object differ for buyers
and sellers (Birnbaum & Stegner, 1979; Birnbaum, Yeary, Luce, &
Zhao, 2002). Consistent with this explanation, Carmon and Ariely
(2000) suggested that the endowment effect is caused by a “focus
on the forgone” (pp. 360). In their account, buying and selling
generate increased attention to the object that is about to be lost. In
the typical endowment study, they argued, buyers focus on the
money that they are about to give up, and sellers focus on the good
that they are about to surrender. This account is supported by
studies that manipulate aspects of the good or money, with independent effects on buying and selling prices. For example, the list
price of a ticket to a basketball game affects buying prices more
than selling prices, whereas the anticipated climate in the arena
influences selling prices more than buying prices.
However, these ideas may be only a start in understanding what
underlies the endowment effect. In this article, we develop and test
a process account of endowment effects that is based on the notion
that valuations depend on memory retrieval processes. This approach has several advantages: First, it connects the valuation of
simple objects with the literature on memory and leverages our
understanding of retrieval. Second, it may help identify boundary
conditions, delineating when endowment effects may and may not
occur. Third, a process explanation may help identify whether loss
aversion actually reflects experienced preferences or, instead, is an
artifact that should be minimized in measuring values. Finally, a
mechanism-based explanation might suggest interventions that
would reduce or eliminate endowment effects.

A Query Theory of the Endowment Effect
Our starting point is that preferences, like all knowledge, are
subject to the processes and dynamics associated with retrieval
from memory, and that these principles can largely explain the
endowment effect and other phenomena in evaluation (see Weber
& Johnson, 2006). Indeed, if one takes the view that preferences
are sometimes constructed, it seems highly plausible that memory

in general, and in particular the retrieval of information about the
objects in question, will play a central role. In this spirit, Kahneman and colleagues (Kahneman, Ritov, & Schkade, 1999) have
observed that reported preferences are often predictions about
future enjoyment and that these predictions depend on what is
retrieved.

Premises of Query Theory
Our explanation of the endowment effect is based on four
premises. The first is that decision makers naturally decompose
valuation questions such as “What should be my selling (or buying) price?” into a series of queries, such as “Why should I make
the trade?” or “Why should I not make the trade?” The second
premise is that these queries are executed serially, one after the
other, and that query order differs across response modes. Note
that this decomposition and execution may well be automatic,
without the awareness of the decision maker. The third premise of
our account is that because of output interference, query order
matters: The first query results in a richer and more heavily
weighted representation than the second. To produce differences in
valuation, our fourth premise suggests, different response modes
produce different query orders: Choosers tend to first consider why
they might not enter into the transaction and then consider why
they might enter into the transaction. Sellers, we argue, tend to
execute the same two queries in the reverse order.
The first premise, that valuation is based on a series of queries,
suggests that people respond to a question like “How much would
you pay for this mug?” by decomposing it into a series of standard
queries (Collins & Michalski, 1989). To be more precise, we argue
that the decision maker first considers the advantages of current
state or status quo and then considers the opposite state of affairs.
For example, a seller will tend to first evaluate the advantages of
owning the mug. To illustrate, in Table 1 we provide a possible
taxonomy of the aspects considered in a pricing judgment, along
with typical aspects listed by participants in our experiments.
These four types of aspects fall into two categories. Positive
aspects focused on the object (e.g., a mug) and negative aspects
focused on the currency are termed value increasing, because they
tend to enhance the value of the object. These are shown in the top
left and bottom right panels of the table. Aspects that focus on
negative properties of the object or on positive properties of the
currency are termed value decreasing, because they tend to reduce
the value of the object. Our analysis is novel in that we argue that
queries are about the ad hoc goal-derived categories asking about
why the trade should or should not be made (Barsalou, 1983),
whereas Carmon and Ariely (2000) suggested that focus is driven
by the natural categories of objects and currency. We argue that
this focus on the advantages and disadvantages of the trade is
based on the need to evaluate the current potential action, but we
will test this claim empirically.
Our second premise is based, in the decision literature, on the
idea that different weights are revealed by different response
modes and, consistent with Fischer et al. (1999), that this shift in
weights is caused by a shift in the goals that are used to construct
values for different response modes. For example, Fischer et al.
suggested such differences in goals as an explanation of the
prominence effect—the finding that decision makers are more
likely to prefer the alternative that is superior on the most impor-

tant attribute in choice rather than in matching (Tversky, Sattath, &
Slovic, 1988).
Our third premise, that the results of queries depend on query
order, is based on the idea of output interference in memory
research, suggesting that directed recall of some members of a list
can result in a decrease in memory for the unrecalled part of the list
(Dempster, 1995). This observation closely parallels the phenomenon of retrieval-induced forgetting (Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork,
1994; Anderson & Spellman, 1995; Perfect, Moulin, Conway, &
Perry, 2002) and is related to a number of memory phenomena.
Similar interference effects have been demonstrated in many different experimental paradigms, including the closely related partlist cuing paradigm (Mueller & Watkins, 1977). The effects seem
robust, occurring for both semantic and episodic memory and for
verbal as well as nonverbal materials, such as visual stimuli and
motor skills (see Anderson & Neely, 1996, for a review). Recent
studies have identified conditions under which implicit memory
also demonstrates interference effects (Lustig & Hasher, 2001;
Perfect et al., 2002). Although there is a current debate on the
relationship between inhibition and interference (Anderson &
Spellman, 1995; MacLeod, Dodd, Sherad, Wilson, & Bibi, 2003),
we simply require that queries show order dependence, such that
the first query leads to suppression of answers to the second,
generating a different set of query results, which the decision
maker then uses to construct the value of an object. Because we are
agnostic about the mechanism generating the effect, we distinguish
the empirical observation of interference from putative mechanisms such as inhibition (Friedman & Miyake, 2004; MacLeod et
al., 2003). Our specific idea is that retrieving one type of information about the potential trade, such as the positive features of the
mug, will interfere with retrieval of the other aspects of the trade,
such as what else one could do with the money.
Our final premise, that the order of queries depends on the
endowment state, will of course be subject to empirical verification, but it also reflects the intuition that people consider the
advantages of the current state of affairs along with the disadvantages of an alternative reality before they think about the disadvantages of their current state and the advantages of an alternative
reality. Put another way, decision makers tend to first assess the
advantages of the status quo, then assess the advantages of the
alternative state (Kahneman & Miller, 1986).

Aspect Listing
To obtain some indication of the aspects considered during a
pricing decision, we used a variant of a verbal report methodology
called an aspect listing. We asked respondents to type into a
computer interface the things they were considering as they made
their pricing judgment, recording the content, order, and latency of
these entries. Of course, this is only an approximate measure of the
cognitions that occur as respondents make this judgment. Although
the queries themselves may be automatic processes and thus difficult to observe, the aspect-listing method is designed to capture
their effect by showing what is produced by the queries. Compared
with more sophisticated measures, however, this approach has the
advantage of being easily scalable to the kinds of large samples
and market settings that are used to demonstrate the endowment
effect.

Predictions
This perspective produces several clear predictions that we test
in the course of this research, specifically, the following:
1.

Listed aspects should differ, in content and number,
depending on an individual’s endowment state.

2.

The sequence of aspects should correspond to our hypothesized order of queries, which depends on endowment state. Although we cannot observe the queries used
per se, we should be able to see their effects in what is
produced. Specifically, when participants are endowed
with the good, value-increasing aspects should be more
numerous and appear earlier in the aspect protocol, and
the opposite should occur when participants are not endowed.

3.

Aspect listings should predict prices. If the retrieval of
aspects is used to determine value, then the quantity and
valence of aspects should predict prices. This finding
would demonstrate that these concurrent reports (Ericsson & Simon, 1993) are not epiphenomenal and, if we
observe the standard pattern of prices, not reactive
(Russo, Johnson, & Stephens, 1989).

4.

Changing the order of queries might eliminate the endowment effect. Because endowment changes query order, which in turn changes the kinds of aspects considered, we might, by manipulating the order of queries,
change prices. By reversing the natural order of queries,
we should be able to diminish or eliminate the endowment effect.

5.

Finally, we should be able to produce changes in value
without endowment. If the construction of value depends
on query order, changing query order alone should
change people’s valuation of a good, even when ownership is held constant.

General Method
With the current work we sought to explain a phenomenon
widely replicated using the methods of experimental economics
with concepts from the study of memory. In our experiments, we
attempted to meet the requirements of experimental economics
(Hertwig & Ortmann, 2001), while facing the challenge of collecting individual-level measures appropriate for testing our hypotheses. We implemented a number of practices that are common in
experimental economics. All transactions were real—mugs were
actually bought, sold, or chosen in a market. Experimental sessions
consisted of small groups of participants who actually paid or
received money as a result of their pricing decisions. There was no
deception. Finally, we used comprehension tests to ensure that
participants understood all critical task instructions, and we eliminated participants who did not.

Experiment 1: Does Endowment Change the Aspects
Considered?
This experiment was based on a standard endowment paradigm,
with the exception that participants were also asked to list aspects
of what they considered prior to indicating their valuations.1 After
setting their price and executing any ensuing market transactions,
respondents saw these aspects again and indicated both the focus
(thoughts about the object or the money) and the valence of each.
If these aspect listings reflect the information retrieved from memory and used by respondents to determine their valuation, they
should differ in content, number, and order for choosers and
sellers. In addition, we expected these aspects to predict prices.

Method
Participants
Eighty-seven participants were recruited on a university campus. They were each paid $5 for their participation and, depending
on their choices, received either a mug or a cash amount determined by their choices and the incentive-compatible mechanism.

ipants had to indicate an experimenter-induced valuation of a
good. They were allowed to proceed only if they entered this
valuation correctly.
Test of understanding. Some have argued that the endowment
effect may involve respondents’ misconceptions of task instructions (Plott & Zeiler, 2005). The BDM approach to value elicitation (described above) is fairly complex. Participants were told
both in the general introduction at the beginning of the experiment
and in the instructions to the endowment task that the transaction
was actually going to be carried out in accordance with their
responses and that once they had indicated their valuations they
would not be able to change their mind. To ensure that participants
fully understood the pricing task and market mechanism, we asked
them to identify which outcomes would occur under certain hypothetical conditions (i.e., different market prices) given the valuation they had entered during the practice task. All respondents
were given two multiple-choice questions repeatedly until they
answered both correctly. Random responding to these test questions (without repetition) would require an average of five attempts
to pass. Seven participants (out of 87) did no better than chance
and were eliminated.
Revelation of endowment state. Participants were given the
opportunity to examine a mug placed in front of them, after which
they proceeded to a computer screen that revealed their endowment state—they were randomly assigned to either a “selling”
condition (i.e., endowed) or a “choosing” condition (i.e., not
endowed). More specifically, respondents were informed either (a)
that the mug was theirs to keep but that they would later have an
opportunity to sell it to the experimenter for some amount of
money (selling condition) or (b) that they would later be able to
choose between receiving the mug and receiving some amount of
money (choosing condition).
Aspect listing. Before indicating their valuation of the mug,
participants listed the aspects they were considering in making
their decisions. Specifically, they were asked to type all reasons
why they personally would want to either have the mug or have the
money, one reason at a time (see Appendix A for details).
Pricing. To eliminate the potential confound of wealth states
with endowment, we contrasted selling prices to a choice condition, in which participants chose between receiving the mug and
receiving various amounts of money. This contrast controls for the
wealth position of those endowed and those not endowed, with the
only difference between conditions being the description of the
transaction (see Lerner, Small, & Loewenstein, 2004, p. 338, for
further discussion of why choice is a superior control to selling).
Participants revealed their valuation of the mug on a scale ranging
from $.50 to $12, with increments of 50 cents. In the selling
condition, participants were asked to indicate whether, at each of
these 24 prices, they would prefer to sell the mug or not (see
Appendix B for details). The corresponding question in the choos-

Materials and Procedure
Practice task. Prior to the main task, respondents completed a
practice task during which they were required to use the computer
interfaces for both aspect listing and pricing in a domain unrelated
to that used in the main task. To practice the pricing task, partic-

The thought-listing procedure used here differs from other methods for
assessing reasons, such as cognitive responses (Cacioppo, von Hippel, &
Ernst, 1997), in that it is concurrent with rather than retrospective to the
task and serves as a manipulation as well as a measure.

<-----Page 4----->QUERY THEORY AND THE ENDOWMENT EFFECT

ing condition was whether, for each of the amounts, participants
would prefer to get the mug or the money.2
Market transaction. Once participants had completed the pricing task, the experimenter announced the market price, which had
been determined a priori. Transactions were then completed according to the preference that each participant had expressed in
connection with that amount during the pricing task. That is, in the
selling condition, participants either kept the mug or sold it to the
experimenter for the market price (in cash), depending on their
earlier response. In the choosing condition, participants either
received a mug or the market price (in cash), according to their
preference as revealed in the pricing task.
Self-coding of aspects. Participants were presented with the
aspects they had listed earlier, one at a time, and asked to indicate
both the focus (whether the statement referred to the mug or the
money) and the valence (positive or negative, in reference to the
focus) of each aspect. Of note, in several other studies we have had
aspects coded by naive raters, and these codings produce very
similar results.
Finally, participants responded to a series of general questions,
including the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS;
Watson, Clarke, & Tellegen, 1988) for measuring mood and some
demographic questions, and completed a funnel debriefing for
detecting evidence of suspicion as to the purpose of the study.

Results
Prices
As can be seen in the top line of Figure 1, this study replicated
the standard endowment effect. Sellers, who had been endowed
with a mug, demanded an average of $5.71 to surrender it. Choosers, who faced the same economic decision but had not been
endowed with anything, were indifferent between getting a mug
and receiving $3.42, on average. This difference was significant,
F(1, 79) ⫽ 228.9, p ⬍ .0001, and similar results are provided by
a median test ( p ⬍ .01).

Content of Aspects
Participants generated different aspects depending on whether
they were endowed, as shown in Figure 1. As suggested by our
query account, choosers produced more value-decreasing aspects
(positive thoughts about the money and negative thoughts about
the mug) than sellers (2.38 vs. 1.77), whereas sellers produced
more value-increasing aspects (positive thoughts about the mug
and negative thoughts about the money) than choosers (1.81 vs.
1.43). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed this interaction between endowment and aspect type, F(1,
75) ⫽ 3.82, p ⬍ .06.

Order of Aspects
The sequential nature of our query account predicts that the kind
of aspects generated will change during the aspect listing. For
participants endowed with a mug, we expected that aspect listings
would initially consist of mostly value-increasing aspects and that
value-decreasing aspects would be produced more frequently toward the end. We expected the reverse would be true for participants not endowed with a mug.

465

Because participants listed different numbers of aspects, we
tested this prediction by calculating, for each participant, a score
that reflects his or her tendency to produce value-increasing aspects before value-decreasing ones. This score, the standardized
median rank difference of aspect types (SMRD), is defined as
2(MRi ⫺ MRd)/n, where MRd ⫽ median rank of value-decreasing
aspects in a participant’s sequence, MRi ⫽ median rank of valueincreasing aspects in a participant’s sequence, and n ⫽ total
number of aspects in a participant’s sequence.3 The SMRD score
can take on values from 1 (all value-increasing aspects were listed
before any value-decreasing aspects) to –1 (all value-decreasing
aspects were listed before any value-increasing aspects).
As predicted, the mean SMRD score was significantly higher for
sellers (.62) than for choosers (.26), F(1, 79) ⫽ 4.14, p ⬍ .05. This
result provides support for our hypothesis that ownership of an
object leads to a difference in queries, as reflected by differences
in the order in which aspects are produced.

Predicting Prices From Aspects
The aspects generated by respondents are not epiphenomenal, or
what economists term “cheap talk,” because they help predict
participants’ valuations of the mug. Using price as a dependent
variable and the number of value-increasing aspects and valuedecreasing aspects produced by each respondent as independent
variables in a multiple regression reveals that this crude encoding
of aspects explains 21% of the variance in valuations, F(4, 75) ⫽
4.81, p ⬍ .001. Both regression coefficients are in the expected
direction—that is, the effects of the number of value-increasing
and value-decreasing aspects on price are positive and negative,
respectively. As a comparison, endowment state (i.e., whether a
participant was a seller or a chooser) explains only 16% of the
variance in valuations.

Discussion
Experiment 1 provides initial support for the first three of the
five predictions of our query-based account of the endowment
effect: First, respondents generate different kinds of aspects if they
are setting selling prices than if they are choosing between the
object and a set of cash amounts. This experiment also provides
strong support for the hypothesized change in recall order: Consistent with our prediction that endowment state influences query
order, value-increasing statements are generated earlier by sellers
and value-decreasing statements are generated earlier by choosers.
Finally, consistent with the third prediction of our theoretical
account, the number and valence of these aspects predict valuations, and they do so at least as well as the endowment manipulation itself.

Note that for any sequence (of length s) in which only one of the two
response categories of interest (i.e., value-increasing or value-decreasing
aspects) appears, the median rank of the unobserved response category is
set to s ⫹ 1, which is a conservative way of representing the low level of
accessibility of thoughts of that type. In addition, for the purpose of
calculating the SMRD score, n ⫽ s ⫹ 1 for such single-category sequences.
For sequences that include responses from both categories, n ⫽ s.

Experiment 2: Eliminating Endowment Effects
Although the results of Experiment 1 support our query theory
account of the endowment effect, much of this evidence is correlational and could also be consistent with other accounts. Stronger
evidence for our query-based explanation would be provided by a
test of our fourth prediction, that by manipulating the order of
queries, we might actually influence the aspects considered by
respondents and the magnitude of the endowment effect. In Experiment 2, we did this by manipulating, for some participants, the
order in which they generated value-increasing versus valuedecreasing aspects. In particular, we included a condition that
reversed the natural order of queries to memory for a given
endowment state suggested by our query theory and confirmed by
Experiment 1. We expected that this reversal of the natural query
order would result in a smaller endowment effect, as well as a
difference in the nature of the aspects produced by participants.

Method
Participants
Eighty-three participants were recruited on a university campus.
They were paid $5 each for their participation and, depending on
their choices during the experiment, also received either a mug or
a cash amount, as determined by the incentive-compatible BDM
mechanism.

Materials and Procedure
The procedure was similar to Experiment 1, starting with a
practice task. Again, participants who did no better than chance in
the practice task were eliminated (10 participants). In addition, 1

participant was eliminated for evidently having misunderstood the
aspect-listing task. This left us with 72 usable participants.
As in Experiment 1, participants were assigned to either a
selling condition (i.e., endowed) or a choosing condition (i.e., not
endowed). After learning their endowment state and before indicating their valuation of the mug, participants listed the aspects
they were considering in making their decisions. We used two
aspect-listing conditions. One was an unguided condition where,
as in Experiment 1, participants simply listed all of the aspects they
were considering without any externally imposed query order. In
the other condition, the natural order of queries to memory for a
given endowment state suggested by our theory was reversed, such
that sellers (endowed) were asked to first produce valuedecreasing aspects and then produce value-increasing aspects,
whereas choosers (not endowed) were asked to list valueincreasing before value-decreasing aspects. Thus, participants in
Experiment 2 were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in
a 2 (endowment state: selling vs. choosing) ⫻ 2 (order of aspect
generation: unguided vs. reverse of natural order) betweensubjects design.

Results
Prices
As can be seen from the line graph in Figure 2, we observed a
strong endowment effect in the unguided aspect-listing condition
but not in the conditions in which the aspect-listing task reversed
what we believe to be the natural query order. Indeed, in the latter
condition, the endowment effect was eliminated entirely. An
ANOVA on prices confirmed these observations, with a significant

68) ⫽ 5.04, p ⬍ .05. This is best described by an analysis of simple
effects within the two aspect-listing conditions, which revealed a
large endowment effect for unguided aspect listing, F(1, 68) ⫽
7.55, p ⬍ .01, as shown on the left side of Figure 2, but no
endowment effect in the reverse-order condition, F(1, 68) ⫽ 0.24,
p ⬎ .50, as can be seen on the right side of the graph. Thus, our
manipulation—simply altering the order in which participants reported the aspects they were considering—was successful in completely eliminating the endowment effect.

Content of Aspects
Again, we expected the aspects considered by participants to
vary as a function of their endowment state and the nature of the
aspect production task. In particular, we anticipated a significant
effect of endowment on the aspects considered, but only for the
unguided query format and not for the reverse of the natural order.
Here, we computed the difference between the number of valueincreasing and value-decreasing aspects that each participant produced. The means of these difference scores for the four conditions
are depicted in the bar graph in Figure 2.
Consistent with the results of Experiment 1, respondents in the
unguided condition produced substantially fewer value-increasing
than value-decreasing aspects (indicated by a negative difference
score) when they were not endowed with the mug and produced a
roughly equal number of the two types of aspects (indicated by a
difference score close to zero) when they were endowed. By
contrast, when the natural query order was reversed, participants

produced a roughly equal number of value-increasing and valuedecreasing aspects, independent of endowment state.
We tested these impressions with a repeated measures ANOVA
that included aspect type as a within-subject factor and endowment
state and aspect query format as between-subjects factors. Our
primary interest was the Endowment ⫻ Query Format interaction,
which was statistically significant, F(1, 67) ⫽ 4.14, p ⬍ .05. An
analysis of simple effects revealed that only the unguided condition, and not the reverse-order condition, showed the interaction
between aspect type and endowment.
The crossover interaction in difference scores for aspects in
Figure 1 mirrors the pattern of prices and suggests that, as hypothesized, the differences in considered aspects are responsible for the
differences in the endowment effect. To further test this theory, we
regressed the prices of the mug on both the number of valueincreasing and the number of value-decreasing aspects. As predicted, the coefficient for value-increasing aspects was positive
(␤ ⫽ .47, p ⬍ .05) and that for value-decreasing aspects was
negative (␤ ⫽ –.34, p ⬍ .06, one-tailed).

Order of Aspects
The unguided query condition allowed an analysis of the sequence of aspects generated by participants. Recall that although
we expected both value-increasing and value-decreasing aspects to
be produced by all participants, we predicted that ownership of the
object would affect the order of queries. This, in turn, should lead
to different sequential patterns in the list of aspects generated.

As in Experiment 1, we calculated an SMRD score for each
respondent, a metric ranging from 1 to –1 and reflecting the
tendency to produce value-increasing aspects before valuedecreasing ones. The results strongly support our hypothesis. The
mean SMRD score was much higher for sellers (.77) than for
choosers (.12). This difference is statistically significant, F(1,
37) ⫽ 6.40, p ⬍ .05, further corroborating the query theory
prediction that ownership renders value-increasing aspects more
easily accessible in memory relative to value-decreasing aspects.

Discussion
Experiment 2 succeeded in eliminating the endowment effect,
the fourth prediction of our query-based account. It also replicated
several other key predictions of a query account: first, the difference in the types of aspects produced by respondents depending on
their endowment state; second, the difference in the sequential
pattern of listed aspects between endowed and unendowed participants in the unguided condition; and third, the ability of aspects to
predict prices.

Experiment 3: Endowment Effects Without Ownership
Although the results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that the
differences in query order are necessary for the endowment effect
to occur, they do not answer the question of whether these differences might be sufficient. We examined this in the next study, in
which we attempted to induce changes in valuations due to differences in query order alone.

Method

used in Experiment 2. Eight participants failed to understand the
practice task, and 1 was dropped because of technical problems.

Materials and Procedure
After a warm-up aspect-listing task, instruction, testing on the
incentive-compatible mechanism, and inspection of the mug, participants were informed that they were going to be choosing
between various amounts of money and the mug—that is, nobody
was endowed with a mug. All participants then completed two
aspect-listing tasks, the order of which was manipulated. Participants were randomly assigned either to first generate valueincreasing aspects followed by value-decreasing aspects or to
produce the two types of aspects in the reverse order.

Results
Prices
Could simply reversing the order of the queries produce a
difference in the price paid for the mugs? Recall that when the
production of value-increasing aspects precedes that of valuedecreasing aspects, we expected prices to be higher than when the
order is reversed. The results support this hypothesis. Although all
participants were in the same endowment state (i.e., not endowed
with a mug) and responded to the same set of aspect questions,
merely manipulating the order in which the two types of aspects
were generated resulted in a mean price difference in the predicted
direction of $1.67—a 41% increase in valuations (see the line in
Figure 3). The difference between these mean prices is statistically
significant, F(1, 41) ⫽ 6.10, p ⬍ .05.

tion, we tallied the number of value-increasing and valuedecreasing aspects for each of the two aspect-listing orders (see
the bars in Figure 3). Our hypothesis focuses on whether the
order of the aspect listing changes this tally. Specifically, we
predicted an interaction between type of aspects and order of
listing. Consistent with our prediction, the interaction between
order of aspect listing and type of aspect is significant, F(1,
41) ⫽ 3.49, p ⬍ .05 (one-tailed). However, there is also a main
effect of aspect type, with value-decreasing aspects being more
common.
Finally, we used the number of value-increasing and valuedecreasing aspects produced by each participant to predict prices
and found a significant overall relationship, F(2, 40) ⫽ 4.33, p ⬍
.05 (r2 ⫽ .18). Both coefficients were in the correct direction and
were significantly different from each other, but only the one for
value-increasing aspects was significantly different from zero
(␤ ⫽ .64), t(1, 40) ⫽ 2.9, p ⬍ .05. This coefficient indicates that
for each additional value-increasing aspect that was generated, a
respondent’s valuation of the mug increased by 64 cents, on
average.

General Discussion
We have introduced a query theory of loss aversion, from
which we have derived five predictions about the endowment
effect as a memory-based phenomenon. In three experiments,
we have demonstrated (1) that endowment influences the aspects that individuals consider (Experiments 1 and 2), (2) that
endowment changes the order in which aspects are recalled
(Experiments 1 and 2), (3) that these aspects are related to
decision makers’ valuations of objects (Experiments 1, 2, and
3), and that by changing the order of aspect queries, we can (4)
eliminate the endowment effect (Experiment 2) as well as (5)
produce an endowment effect in the absence of actual ownership (Experiment 3).
One possible concern with the evidence presented here is that
although the aspect-listing results of Experiment 1 are consistent
with our theory, the manipulation of query order in Experiments 2
and 3 may have induced mental processes that would not occur
naturally. However, the fact that the valuation results in the “natural” order conditions of Experiment 2 are very similar to those
produced by other researchers without aspect listings (see, e.g.,
Kahneman et al., 1991, Experiments 6 and 7) seems to indicate that
imposing a query order might not lead to any significant departures
from what people would do spontaneously.
Moreover, work by Nayakankuppam and Mishra (2005) provides an indirect measure of the accessibility of aspects of an
object for buyers and sellers. In that study, respondents were first
asked to learn positively and negatively valenced items about a
mug. Respondents then set either a buying or a selling price for the
mug and, after a delay, were asked to recall the features of the
mug. As predicted by our theory, sellers had more accurate recall
for the positive features of the mug and worse recall for its
negative features. Buyers showed the reverse pattern, consistent
with the idea that the first query causes interference and reduced
accessibility for the second. Finally, in a related test in the domain
of intertemporal choice, Weber et al. (2006) used a verification
task that showed that participants were faster to identify the items

469

that query theory suggests should be more accessible after a
decision.

Aspects Versus Objects: Prediction and Mediation
We have shown that the aspects considered differ for choosers
and sellers and that by merely manipulating the order in which
they are generated, we can both create and destroy endowment
effects. In this section, we would like to do two things: clarify one
interpretation of the “focus on the foregone” perspective of Carmon and Ariely (2000) and examine the predictive ability and
possible mediation of both that account and the one introduced
here. As Carmon and Ariely stated, theirs is an attention-based
account, and a simple version of their story is that more attention
is paid to either the object or the currency, depending on the
response mode. In the case of the typical endowment effect experiment, this is either the mug or money (i.e., the rows in Table
1). Forgoing the mug, for example, involves giving up the negative
aspects of the mug as well. A more nuanced approach is to suggest,
as we do in Table 1, that it is the positive and the negative aspects
of the exchange that produce the differences in valuation (i.e., the
diagonals in Table 1).
To contrast these object-based and exchange-based accounts, we
conducted tests of mediation using all of the data from Experiments 1 and 2 that were collected without any externally imposed
query order, for a total of 115 participants. We first examined
whether endowment changed the focus (mug vs. money, corresponding to an object-based account) of the generated aspects or
rather the number of value-increasing versus value-decreasing
thoughts (corresponding to an exchange-based account). We did
this by calculating, for the object-based account, a difference score
between the number of aspects focused on the money and the mug
and, for our exchange-based account, a difference score between
the number of value-increasing and value-decreasing aspects. Both
showed significant differences ( p ⬍ .05, based on an ANOVA) in
the predicted directions: For the object account, the mean difference score was 1.27 for the endowed respondents and 0.57 for
those not endowed. For the exchanged-based account, the equivalent difference scores were – 0.06 and –1.07. Next, we tried to
predict prices from these difference scores using a regression
model. Here, the difference in focus (mug vs. money) had no
effect, t(113) ⫽ 0.62, whereas the difference in value-increasing
versus value-decreasing aspects had a significant effect, t(113) ⫽
3.27, p ⫽ .001. As an illustration, each additional positive aspect
(or deleted negative aspect) increased the value of the mug by 37
cents.
We also examined whether either measure mediated the endowment effect by conducting a Sobel test on these coefficients.
Although the object-based account was far from significant (t ⫽
0.6, p ⬎ .50), the difference between the number of valueincreasing and value-decreasing aspects, corresponding to our
exchange-based account, showed significant mediation, t(113) ⫽
2.07, p ⬍ .04. Given that the aspect listings are a noisy measure of
cognition, we expected at best partial mediation, and that is what
we achieved, with an estimated PM of .22. Such partial mediation
(Shrout & Bolger, 2002) suggests that other processes play into the
endowment effect and/or that there is significant attenuation due to

<-----Page 9----->JOHNSON, HÄUBL, AND KEINAN

470

error in the observed mediators, both of which are important
questions for future research.4

A Latent Semantic Analysis
Our query theory account suggests that choosers and sellers use
very different aspects of their knowledge to evaluate the possible
exchange. Although we have had both participants themselves and
naive raters code the generated aspects, these procedures assume
that the taxonomy in Table 1 adequately captures these differences.
To examine in a more inductive way what choosers and sellers
consider in setting a price, we submitted all of the aspects listed by
participants in Experiment 1 to latent semantic analysis (LSA;
Landauer & Dumais, 1997), specifically examining the single
word identified by the LSA algorithm to be the nearest neighbor
(i.e., most closely related) to each aspect listed by participants.
Thus, we used the LSA as a “blind coder,” asking it to identify the
single word most similar to each aspect. Differences in the semantic meaning of the aspects, whether or not they are consistent with
our coding scheme, would be revealed by these nearest neighbors.
If respondents consider different things when selling and choosing,
we would expect differences in the nearest neighbors across response modes. The LSA algorithm analyzes a large corpus of text,
in our case the tasaALL semantic space, based on a body of texts,
novels, newspaper articles, and other materials thought to be
approximately representative of the reading done by a college-age
student. It uses singular value decomposition to identify relations
in the semantics of input documents using their co-occurrence in
that corpus.
In Table 2, we list eight common nearest neighbors (words
returned by LSA as most closely associated with an aspect) that
differ in frequency for choosers and sellers. Words with very low
frequencies in the corpus (i.e., fewer than 50 occurrences) were
excised from the list, and alternative forms of single or similar
words (e.g., drinks, drink, and drinking, or my and mine) are
combined. Although some words, such as money, are frequent for
both choosers and sellers, there are also some marked differences.
The top half of Table 2 shows four nearest neighbors that are more
frequent for sellers. Drink, emphasizing uses of the mug, is the
second most common neighbor for sellers. Similarly, want and
need appear more frequently as neighbors for sellers. In contrast,
the bottom half of Table 2 contains words such as spend and earn,

which are more frequent neighbors for choosers. These words
show up almost twice as frequently for choosers, emphasizing the
giving up of money. Of interest, consistent with speculation in
social psychology, personal pronouns occur more frequently for
sellers, suggesting that identification with the self is tapped more
by sellers than by choosers (Beggan, 1992). Although this is
clearly an exploratory effort, the use of such data-driven analysis
suggests that different types of knowledge are being tapped by
choosers and sellers.

Other Related Phenomena
One facet of this research is that it suggests that counterbalancing the order of positive and negative aspects is more than merely
a control for a nuisance variable. It is indeed, because of inhibition,
a theoretically important manipulation. Although not motivated by
an interference perspective, several studies have manipulated the
natural order of queries, often in an attempt to debias judgments.
Hoch (1984) examined interference in the prediction of preferences and thus future purchase intentions. Participants were asked
to provide reasons why they would or would not buy a consumer
product in the future. He counterbalanced the order of the two
tasks, arguing that the first task caused interference with the
second. Consistent with this notion, he found that participants
generated more reasons in the first task than in the second and that
the first task thus had greater influence on the prediction of
purchase intentions—a primacy effect. Participants were more
likely to predict that they would purchase the item when they
generated reasons for buying it first. Note that all participants
answered both types of questions; only the order changed. To
demonstrate that the effect was due to memory interference, Hoch
conducted another study, separating the two reason-generation
tasks in time. Consistent with the fact that interference is a transient phenomenon, he found no evidence of interference in that
study and instead observed a recency effect, in which the output of
the second task received more weight in people’s prediction of
purchase intentions.
Other studies that varied the kind or order of information reported by respondents found similar effects. Koriat, Lichtenstein,
and Fischhoff (1980) argued that overconfidence results from
asking first why one might be right and then why one might be
wrong. The interference account suggests that overconfidence
occurs because people naturally generate pro reasons first, not
necessarily because they have a motivational stake in generating
more pro than con reasons. Consistent with this explanation,
Koriat et al. showed that asking explicitly for reasons why an
answer might be wrong diminishes overconfidence. Similarly,
asking for reasons why an anchor might be irrelevant has been
shown to reduce the anchoring effect (Chapman & Johnson, 1999;
Mussweiler, Strack, & Pfeiffer, 2000).
Query theory clearly owes a debt to the idea of reason-based
choice (Shafir, Simonson, & Tversky, 1993), which shares the idea
4

To illustrate the possible role of measurement error in attenuating PM,
let us assume that mediation is perfect in the absence of error—that is, the
standardized coefficients of endowment on aspects and of aspects on prices
are both 1. If both the aspect listing and the stated price have test–retest
reliabilities of .71, we will observe a PM of 1 * .5 * .5 * 1 ⫽ .25, which is
very close to the value of .22 that we observed.

<-----Page 10----->QUERY THEORY AND THE ENDOWMENT EFFECT

that choice is based on the recall and construction made to justify
the decision. This stands in contrast to views that suggest that loss
aversion originates in the way gains and losses are perceived
(Coombs & Avrunin, 1977). We extend that notion here by suggesting a specific mechanism for differences between reasons,
observing them in aspect listings, and applying that notion to loss
aversion.

Affect, Aspects, and Endowment
Given recent research reporting differences in the endowment
effect when strong affect is induced (Lerner et al., 2004), it is
natural to ask about the relationship between our memory-based
account and one that posits affect as a driving force behind
endowment. We did attempt to measure any affect that was induced by using the PANAS immediately after the prices were
generated in Experiments 1 and 2. The results were inconsistent: In
Experiment 1, we found that endowment led to an increase in
positive affect but had no effect on negative affect. When we
performed a mediation analysis, by including positive affect as a
predictor, it proved to be a significant predictor of prices but was
not a significant mediator. In Experiment 2, we found at best
marginal results. However, this finding does not eliminate a role
for affect. An overt measure like the PANAS may well not
measure subtle and fleeting changes in affect. Furthermore, we
know that induced affect can have a major role in changing the
nature of endowment.
Our current results suggest an interesting speculation: that recall
of affective states might be part of the changed information used in
making a pricing judgment and that changes in affect might
influence what is recalled. Perhaps affect operates by changing the
aspects people consider when they construct their valuations. The
relationship between memory-based and affect-based explanations
of the endowment effect is one that is likely to be interesting and
complementary.

Status of the Endowment Effect and Loss Aversion
The results reported here stand in stark contrast to many studies
that have also tried to diminish the effect of endowment on
valuation. Because loss aversion and the endowment effect represent challenges to much extant economic theory, this phenomenon
has attracted significant attention from skeptical economists. For
example, some economists have proposed that intense experience
with the goods used (List, 2003, 2004) or extensive instruction in
trading may diminish or eliminate the endowment effect.
Our approach illustrates that economists have tried too hard,
perhaps, with the wrong model of human behavior. Although
significant incentives alone are not enough to diminish the endowment effect, a subtle manipulation—simply reversing the order of
two questions about the possible exchange— does. This finding,
along with recent results concerning affect, suggests the value of a
psychological theory of the endowment effect.
Our findings also speak to those who argue that the endowment
effect might be due to a misunderstanding of the task. The use of
tests measuring how well respondents understand task instructions
has been a welcome addition by experimental economists (Hertwig
& Ortmann, 2001). We should note that in the studies reported
here, eliminating participants who did not understand the task

471

actually increased the magnitude of the endowment effect, suggesting that such a lack of understanding adds random noise to the
observed responses.
A key issue raised by this research is the relationship of our
findings to the more general phenomenon of loss aversion. For
example, can an approach based on differing query orders and
inhibition help explain framing and status quo effects? Consistent
with our model but motivated by a different framework are findings by McKenzie and Nelson (2003) that suggest that people use
different language when illustrating and communicating different
frames. Clearly, a more complete model is needed (see Reyna,
Lloyd, & Brainerd, 2003, for similar ideas), but the notion that loss
aversion is based, in part, on memory-based processes seems to
warrant further examination.
Finally, we hope that the current work represents a step in
bridging the gap between two fruitful research traditions to provide
insight into the origins of valuation. Further work should clearly
explore the basis of the memory phenomena we have explored.
Other studies have explored the applicability of retrieval-induced
forgetting to domains such as stereotyping (Dunn & Spellman,
2003) and eyewitness testimony (MacLeod, 2002). By elucidating
the processes underlying the construction of value and by developing methods that span the gaps between paradigms, we believe
that a richer dialogue will ensue.
