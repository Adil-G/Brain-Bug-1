o assist clients with risk management, advisors
must be aware of their clients' risk perceptions.
Malkiel (1982) emphasized the practical importance
of risk perceptions and measurement as follows:
Thequestforbetterriskmeasuresis not simply
an amusingexercisethataccomplishesonly the
satisfaction of permitting academics to play
with theircomputers.It has importantimplications for protectinginvestors.(p. 43)
Early empirical research, using utility-based
models, suggested that risk might be measured by
return distribution moments such as variance and
skewness (Coombes and Bowen 1971, Cooley
1977). Recent studies suggest that the observed
correlation between return distribution moments
and risk perceptions is spurious and results from
decision makers' focus on loss or the possibility of
realizing a return below some "target" or "aspiration" level (Payne 1973; Laughhunn and Payne
1980;Shapira 1995). In addition, empirical evidence
suggests that decision makers do not treat probabilities and outcomes in the multiplicative fashion
assumed by most generalized utility models (Slovic
1967, Camerer 1994). Cognitive research shows that
individuals, with their finite information-gathering
and -processing capacities, rely heavily on heuristics to reduce the mental strain of decision making.
Thus, individuals are subject to "framing effects,"
which may tend to focus their attention on
idiosyncratic risk dimensions (Kahneman and
Tversky 1992, March and Shapira 1992, Hogarth
and Kunreuther 1995).
The purpose of this study is to see if it is possible to identify a common set of risk attributes that
have market significance. The study is unique in
that it relies upon survey data gathered from influ-

RISKAS AN EMERGENT
PHENOMENON
Risk belongs to a class of phenomena that physical
scientists refer to as "emergent." An emergent phenomenon has unique, measurable dimensions that
only arise out of the unique complexity of a situation. For example, time is an emergent phenomenon.
By itself, time, like all emergent phenomena, has no
independent reality. A "time-measurement" dimension can arise, however, that is dependent upon
specific circumstances. For example, if one is concerned with physical aging, time could be measured
in chronological years, whereas if weather conditions are important, time might be measured by the
passage of the seasons.
Lopes (1987) appears to have had this emergent concept in mind when she stated that risk
measures must have "psychological fidelity." That
is, risk must be defined and measured in a way that
ties a stimulus to a particular behavior. More specifically, risk must be related to the loss of what one
values. For example, if avoidance of being plunged
into poverty is a primary consideration, risk might
be related to the loss of a large amount of wealth.
Alternatively, if the demonstration of superior
investment ability is of value, risk might be associated with a portfolio return below that of one's
colleagues.

RISKAS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL
PHENOMENON
Dean and Thompson (1995) recently proposed a
risk model continuum that takes into account not
only risk's emergent nature but also its multidimensional nature. At one end of the continuum are
the "probabilists," who see risk as a function of
probabilities and consequences. At the other end
are the "contextualists," who believe risk to be

characterized by a varying set of attributes, which
may or may not include probabilities. Historically,
most financial risk models have leaned toward the
probabilist end of the continuum because of
finance's close connection with the subjective
expected utility (SEU) model of economics. Utilitybased models are often referred to as psychophysical models because they do not emphasize cognition or motivation but principally deal with how
people experience quantity.
Prospect theory (see Kahneman and Tversky
1992, Olsen 1995), a leading contender among
descriptive models of financial choice, shares many
attributes of the traditional SEU models and also
gives weight to the cognitive limitations of human
decision makers. Farther along the continuum
toward the contextualist end lie the behavioral capital asset pricing model of Shefrin and Statman
(1994), the two-factor model of Lopes (1987), the
ambiguity model of Einhorn and Hogarth (1985),
and the cost/effort model of Payne and Bettman
(1993). The contextualist end of the risk model spectrum is anchored by a large class of models from the
technological and social choice literature. This literature has relied extensively on psychometric technique to identify many of the elusive nuances of risk
(Slovic 1987). These include feelings of control, level
of knowing, potential for catastrophe, fairness, and
trust (Slovic 1993).
In general, cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural
investigations tend to conclude that risk is emergent
and multidimensional (see Goszczynska and
Tadeusz 1991). Formal decision training, however,
with its normative focus, tends to propel experts
toward the probabilist end of the continuum; nonexperts remain near the contextualist end. This distance between experts and nonexperts appears to be
a primary source of disagreement and the perception of poor decision making in the technological
and social realms (Gregory 1989).

Data were gathered from samples of two investor
groups who exert market influence. The first group
consisted of professional portfolio managers who
had responsibility for positioning institutional
investment portfolios. This group was sampled
through a series of surveys mailed to individuals
selected at random from a directory of U.S.-based
Chartered Financial Analysts? (CFA charterholders)
who listed their occupation as portfolio manager or
portfolio strategist. All responses were anonymous,
and response rates exceeded the 25 percent that is
typical of this type of survey research.
The second group consisted of wealthy individuals who took an active role in the management
of their personal portfolios. This group was sampled by mail from a list of clients prepared by a
major West Coast brokerage firm. The typical
(median) respondent had a portfolio net worth of
$285,000 (exclusive of residential real estate, pension, and life insurance), was 55 years of age, and
traded six times a year. The sample response rates,
which exceeded 40 percent, tended to confirm that
these individuals took an active interest in their
investment affairs.

ATTRIBUTESOF INVESTMENT
RISK
The objective of the first survey was to obtain some
nondirected responses about investment risk
attributes. Table 1 presents a summarized listing of
risk attributes gathered in response to the following
open-ended inquiry:

<-----Page 3----->As can be seen, responses related to loss tend to
dominate in importance. The first two categories
accounted for 47 percent and 60 percent of all top
rankings for CFA charterholders and individuals,
respectively, and usually included some reference to
an outcome that is below some target or reference
level. In no case did any respondent refer to risk as
being associated with an unexpectedly high return.
These results, suggesting that decision makers are
loss averse as opposed to risk averse, are consistent
with other studies (see Olsen 1995 and Shapira
1995).
Both respondent groups ranked business risk
as third in importance among risk attributes. CFA
charterholders ranked liquidity and knowledge
fourth and fifth in importance, and individuals
ranked these attributes in the reverse order. The
greater weight placed on liquidity by CFA charterholders is consistent with a greater desire for
liquidity given the higher turnover of institutional
portfolios. Individuals probably give greater
weight to knowledge because they tend to be farther down the informational "food chain" and have
more difficulty evaluating information because of
their relatively lower level of expertise.
The business risk and economic uncertainty
categories are actually sources of risk rather than
risk attributes. In addition, liquidity, which is usually defined as the ability to sell an asset on short
notice without appreciable loss, is an element of
control. Thus, investment risk appears to be composed of four of the same attributes other researchers have found in investigating risk in other
domains (Slovic 1987).

RISKATTRIBUTES
AS DETERMINANTS
OF PERCEIVEDRISK
The first survey suggested that investment risk is a
multidimensional construct with four principal
attributes. These include the possibility of a very
large loss, the possibility of a below-target return,
the ability to control loss, and the investor's level of
knowledge. The objective of the second survey was

to examine the degree to which each of these
attributes influenced investors' perceptions of risk
across selected asset types.
Table 2 presents partial correlation and regression coefficients between each risk attribute and the
overall level of perceived risk across asset types.
The data were obtained by asking respondents to
rate each asset type as to level of perceived risk and
the other four attributes, on Likert-type scales (see
appendix). The statistics in Table 2 indicate that for
both CFA charterholders and individuals, the ability to control loss is the most influential risk
attribute. This attribute is followed by potential for
a large loss, potential for a below-target return, and
level of knowledge. Knowledge as a risk attribute
is consistent with the implications of the "ambiguity and aversion" literature (Baron 1994).
For CFA charterholders, the coefficients of
"potential for large loss" exceed those of individuals by a significant amount. As a group, the individuals in this study tended to hold more
conservative portfolios (i.e., greater proportions of
bonds, blue chip stocks, etc.). Therefore, individuals' lesser concern for large loss was probably the
result of their lower downside exposure. Individuals saw the "ability to control loss" as a more important risk attribute than did CFA charterholders.
This difference is probably a function of individuals' lesser ability to respond to sudden market
changes, because they cannot monitor their investments as efficiently as can professionals.
The high R2in Table 2 implies that the four risk
attributes model perceived investment risk well. In
addition, the differences in the sizes of the attribute
coefficients between CFA charterholders and individuals suggests that idiosyncratic investor characteristics influence risk perceptions.
Do individual asset characteristics influence
risk attribute importance? Table 3 presents partial
correlation coefficients between the four risk
attributes and perceived risk levels, broken down
by asset type. The assets are ranked in order of
increasing perceived risk.

Asset Type

*Significant at the 5 percent level or better.
Notes: N = 137 for each correlation. CFA charterholder and investor responses were combined to provide
an adequate sample size.

The variability in the size of the coefficients
across asset types suggests that risk attribute
importance is influenced by asset characteristics.
For example:
* With the exception of junk bonds, the perceived
risk of debt assets is not much influenced by the
potential of earning a below-target return.
* The perceived risk of equity assets is more
influenced by the potential of a large loss than
is the case for debt securities.
* For all assets, control is the most important risk
attribute. Control seems to be especially influential in the cases of long-term, high-grade corporate bonds and options. This result is most
likely attributable to the poorer liquidity of the
bonds and the high volatility of option prices.
* Junk bonds appear to have a pattern of coefficients similar to that of stocks, especially overthe-counter stocks, which seems reasonable
because many "junk" issues are convertible
into stock and the degree of default risk is
closely tied to company profitability.
Level of knowledge is not influential as a risk
attribute for any asset. This finding might be
expected because the examination of assets by type
tends to reduce within-group heterogeneity.

MARKETSIGNIFICANCE
Our study produced some limited evidence of the
relationship between the four risk attributes and
historical annual returns, using the 10 asset classes.
An estimated average level of perceived risk was
constructed for each asset type by multiplying each
respondent's ratings of the four attributes by the

Financial Analysts Journal * March/April1997

regression coefficients presented in Table 2 and averaging over the total number of respondents. Historical statistics of average annual returns and standard
deviation of returns, corresponding to the 10 asset
classes, were obtained from indexes made available
through Jbbotson and Associates.
The four attributes explained about 77 percent
of the variation in the assets' returns for the 1965-90
period. In contrast, only 58 percent could be
explained by using historical standard deviation of
return as a proxy for investment risk. The strength
of relationships between actual returns and the
four risk attributes is especially surprising, given
the small sample size and the fact that perceived
risk was measured at the survey date (1990) and the
returns were measured as averages over the previous 25 years. The evidence also suggests that historical standard deviations of return may serve as
a rough risk proxy across asset types.

CONCLUSIONS
This research used survey data gathered from
sophisticated investors to demonstrate that perceived investment risk is a multiattribute
phenomenon. The principal risk attributes appear
to be the potential for a below-target return, the
potential for a large loss, the investor's feeling of
control, and the level of knowledge about an investment. The relative importance of each of these
attributes is a function of idiosyncratic investor and
asset characteristics. In addition, the four risk
attributes appeared to explain historical returns better than did historical standard deviation of return.

65

<-----Page 5----->The four investment risk attributes are similar
to those identified in risk studies in other domains.
Also, the dominant role of the feeling of control as
a risk attribute is consistent with other studies of
professional risk taking. In fact, studies of managerial behavior suggest that managers see their personal ability to control or eliminate risk as one of
their principal skills (MacCrimmon and Wehrung
1986, Shapira 1995).

APPENDIX
Survey respondents were asked to rate 10 asset
classes, on a seven-point scale, along the following
dimensions:
* Overall, how risky is each of the following
investments?
* How likely is it that each of the following
investments will earn a return below what you
expect (your target)?
* How knowledgeable do you feel about each of

the investments listed below?
When a loss does occur with an investment
listed below, how likely is it that the loss will
be very large in relation to the amount of
money invested?
* When a loss does occur, how difficult is it by
using your skill and diligence to control (limit)
the size of the loss in each investment listed
below?
Because respondents could not be expected to be
familiar with individual issuers of financial assets,
the previous questions were asked about the following general asset types: insured savings accounts,
long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, long-term highgrade corporate bonds, junk bonds, blue chip
stocks, over-the-counter stocks, real estate investment trust shares, stock options, residential rental
real estate, and gold bullion. Asset order was randomized among questionnaires to avoid order bias.
