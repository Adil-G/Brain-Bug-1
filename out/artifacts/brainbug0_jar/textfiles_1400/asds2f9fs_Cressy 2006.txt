Why do Most Firms Die
Young?

ABSTRACT. A model is developed to explain why most
ﬁrms die in the ﬁrst few years of trading. A risk averse
entrepreneur with initial capital endowment faces a
Brownian motion in net worth over time. To balance
return (proﬁts growth) and risk (variance of proﬁts) she
adopts a portfolio strategy, choosing market positioning
to achieve an optimal combination of risk and return at
each instant, given her ﬁnancial and human capital
endowments and attitude towards risk. Failure occurs
when the ﬁrm’s value falls below the opportunity cost of
staying in business. The resulting distribution of failure is
Inverse Gaussian, implying, for speciﬁc parameter values,
a positively skewed failure curve of the type observed in
practice. In addition the model presents a novel-measure
of management human capital (MHC) which implies that
high MHC entrepreneurs will have higher absolute and
marginal proﬁts growth than low MHC entrepreneurs at
given levels of risk.

1. Introduction
It is a well-established empirical fact that (at least
in Manufacturing industry) young ﬁrms tend to
be more failure prone than older ones (see e.g.,
Hall, 1987, Evans, 1987a, b, Dunne et al., 1989).
Less well-studied is how the failure rate of ﬁrms
varies with time trading within the ﬁrst year or
so of life. Whilst in the small business economics
literature several recent studies suggest that
around half of a randomly selected cohort of
startups die in the ﬁrst two and a half years of
trading, a less known but equally remarkable fact
is that the ﬁrm failure distribution over time

trading is positively skewed with a mean that
appears relatively constant in calendar time
(Ganguly, 1985; Bruderl et al, 1992; Cressy,
1996);1 see Figure 1. To the layperson in this
area the explanation for the shape of the curve is
not immediately obvious: Why should the failure
rate of ﬁrms should ﬁrst rise steeply to a peak at
18–24 months of age and then fall gradually to
converge on a low long run value?2
Recent studies have examined ﬁrm-level determinants of failure. For example, early innovation
might enhance a startup’s survival chances in an
industry dominated by large ﬁrms, or diﬀerences
in human and ﬁnancial capital at start-up (or
prior to closure) and the availability of outside
opportunities to entrepreneurship may be instrumental in the survival of small business (Evans
and Jovanovic, 1989; Bates, 1989; Holtz-Eakin
et al., 1994a, b; Mata, 1992; Cressy, 1996). For
example, human capital in the form of team
starts run by more experienced owners with vocational qualiﬁcations and less outside options
seem to survive longer. Finally, theoretical literature suggests that entrepreneurs may be more
risk-tolerant than wage workers and so choose
the riskier income stream associated with entrepreneurship (Kihlstrom and Laﬀont, 1979). It is
a short argument from there to conclude that
small ﬁrms’ owners may diﬀer in their attitudes
to risk, and that this itself may impact their failure rate, particularly at the startup stage.3 Consistently with the failure curve described above,
some studies have found the determinants of survival to vary with the time the ﬁrm has been
trading for ﬁrm- or industry-level reasons
(Audretsch, 1991; Bruderl et al., 1992; Argarwal
and Audretsch, 2001). However, none of these
studies provide a formal optimising model generating the observed failure curve.
By contrast the work of Jovanovic (1982) and
Ericson and Pakes (1995) generates dynamic

optimising models of the ﬁrm and in principle
failure rates that vary along its lifecyle. Jovanovic
assumes that human capital (eﬃciency) is unknown but can be learnt about by entering business. Ericson and Pakes allow for the role of
learning by doing in addition to learning pure
and simple. What none of these models do is to
take into account the role of human capital evolution in conjunction with risk and risk aversion,
letting the entrepreneur to adjust his portfolio
over time. Little attention has been paid in particular to attitudes to and the management of
uncertainty.4 This is contrary to much observed
reality, and, whilst empirical work in other disciplines than economics allows for the role of
uncertainty, a.perusal of that literature reveals no
formal optimising model of the ﬁrm as the basis
for proper testing (see e.g., Gimeno et al., 1997
and references therein).
The ﬁnance literature has however long recognised that by portfolio rebalancing an individual
can optimise exposure to risk. This fact conforms well with results from recent empirical
studies of successful entrepreneurs who typically
aim to reduce the amount of market uncertainty
they face in engaging in business (e.g., Knight,
1965; Prais, 1983; Delmar, 1995). Risk reduction
for the ﬁrm is achieved by diversiﬁcation across
products and services produced, across clients
supplied and across input producers.5 This practice clearly pays dividends by reducing ﬂuctuation in the ﬁrm’s revenue so that the chances of
it falling below the entrepreneur’s exit threshold
(minimum equity) are thereby lowered. But
‘there is no such thing as a free lunch’ and we
would expect for given levels of entrepreneurial

ability that this lower risk would be purchased
at the expense of a lower return. Likewise,
higher risk is associated with higher return: for
example, if a niche marketing strategy allows the
business to grow faster than the market average,
we should expect this to be associated with
higher variability of proﬁts. A specialist product
or bespoke service will more often than not be
one for which the demand is more variable as
tastes switch capriciously to other product niches
or a larger ﬁrm uses economies of scale to force
down price.
Thus the external environment must be managed eﬀectively for the business to optimise its
response to risk. The ability to do this will be
determined in part by factors internal to the ﬁrm,
including the entrepreneur’s own managerial ability and her attitudes to risk. In economic terms,
entrepreneurial ability can be understood in terms
of the eﬀect of inherent traits or attributes on the
cost, measured by the extra risk involved, of
achieving a given increment to the ﬁrm’s growth
rate. We identify management human capital
(MHC) as the ability to achieve growth at lower
cost in terms of ﬁrm-speciﬁc risk.6 Higher MHC
individuals should have lower costs of growth in
this sense. Attitudes towards risk can also be
expected to play a role in determining the entrepreneur’s selection of projects (see Kihlstrom and
Laﬀont, 1979) with less cautious entrepreneurs
likely to risk exposure to projects with more variable returns. This choice in turn has implications
for failure rates. Firms run by headstrong entrepreneurs whose growth aspirations outstrip their
capacity to manage them–are likely to fail early
as they ‘grow too fast too soon’. In general, risk

<-----Page 2----->105

aversion should be associated with lower failure
rates but also with slower growth.
The present paper provides a theoretical
model to explain how in an uncertain environment human and ﬁnancial capital together with
entrepreneurial risk aversion and human capital
interact with endogenous market positioning to
aﬀect the risk-return distribution faced by an
entrepreneur. It pulls together three strands of
the literature, namely, portfolio theory as a
strategy for balancing risk and return; a variant
on Gibrat’s law as a description of the growth
process; and human capital and market positioning as a determinant of entrepreneurial productivity which is allowed to vary (exogenously)
with the lifecycle of the entrepreneurial team.
The outcome is a model consistent with the
observed ﬁrm failure distribution, with the failure rate ﬁrst rising steeply and then tailing oﬀ
to a low long run value, predicting that indeed
‘most ﬁrms die young’.
The optimal growth-risk model resulting from
this process determines the systematic part of the
ﬁrm’s growth. However, it allows that part of a
ﬁrm’s growth is determined outside the entrepreneur’s control by random proportional shocks to
the ﬁrm’s startup equity value. Finally, we let the
entrepreneur make an optimal decision as to
when, if at all, to quit business. This will involve
the comparison of the likely returns to continuing as compared with the value of an outside
alternative (Jovanovic, 1982; Evans and Jovanovic, 1989). The entrepreneur’s value function will
accordingly contain a stopping rule allowing the
‘switching’ decision to be made optimally. Recent
developments in the theory of investment under
uncertainty (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994) drawing
on the early work of Merton (1969)7 provide the
tools by which this phenomenon can be treated
analytically. In this framework market research is
a control variable of the entrepreneur.8

cost to higher growth in the form of higher risk
and will therefore wish to balance the two. In
the following model we allow both eﬀects to
operate.
Proﬁts, x(t), in any period, starting from some
initial value x(0), are assumed to be subject to
random proportional shocks, i.e. we assume Gibrat’s law holds for the ﬁrm conditional on entrepreneurial human capital.9 In continuous time this
implies that the proﬁt function x follows a Geometric Brownian motion (GBM):
dx ¼ lx x dt þ rx x dz

where lx and rx are known time-invariant functions that represent the expected growth of profits and the variance of proﬁts over a small time
interval.10 These functions are assumed to take
the form:
lx ¼ Hlhb ;

More formally, suppose, then, that an entrepreneur’s proﬁts are aﬀected in two ways by a
choice (market positioning) parameter h a higher
value of which raises the ﬁrm’s growth rate and
simultaneously its variance. A risk-averse entrepreneur will therefore ﬁnd that there is a utility

rx ¼ rha ;

H; r; a; b; h > 0

ð2Þ

Note that h ¼ 1 ¼ B implies that ﬁrm and market parameters are identical so the ﬁrm is ‘centrally positioned’ in the market measured by risk
and return i.e. lx ¼ l and rx ¼ r.
We shall assume in this model that the systematic component of the market growth rate is
non-negative, which implies that the systematic
component of a ﬁrm’s growth, lx, is also nonnegative. This does not of course imply that the
realised growth rate of both market and ﬁrm are
negative.11
From equation (2) a higher h is associated
with a higher expected return and a higher variance of return. With an additional assumption
we can show that this will generate the familiar
positively sloped mean-variance Eﬃcient Frontier
of portfolio analysis. Solving (2) for lx as a function of rx we get:
lx ¼ lH

If h is chosen optimally (i.e. to maximise

the entrepreneur chooses diﬀerent market positioning strategies h. Before we do this we state

market risk. The entrepreneur’s choice of theta
determines both his ﬁrm-speciﬁc risk and ﬁrmspeciﬁc return (lx and rx)12 and thus ‘positions’
her in the market. Whilst l and r are parameters
from the point of view of the entrepreneur, the
actual level of return and risk she faces (lx and
rx) will vary across ﬁrms via h and its determining parameters. The optimal value of h, h*, in

See Figure 2.
In Figure 2 we have two EFs parameterised
by diﬀerent levels of human capital, H. Each is
upward sloping reﬂecting the essential cost of
growth as additional risk. The entrepreneur’s
expected utility indiﬀerence curves are also plotted showing the optimal combination of risk and
return given her preferences, human capital
endowment etc. Tangency points as usual pick
out the optima as H varies. We emphasise here
that l is to be interpreted as market return and r

Management capital plays a natural role here by
raising the entrepreneur’s marginal return for
given level of risk or, equivalently, by reducing
the marginal cost of growth. Thus any changes
in a parameter that increase the height and slope
of the eﬃcient frontier can be identiﬁed as economically eﬃcient. Management human capital
(i.e. managerial ability, particularly in the management of risk), henceforth MHC, is an obvious
candidate for this role.

Deﬁnition 2: Management Human capital is
any parameter more of which reduces the marginal
cost of growth measured along the EF, i.e. reduces

Remark: An example of such a parameter is H
in equation (3) above.
Proposition 1: Management human capital
(MHC) measured by the parameter H of equation
3 increases the height and slope of the Eﬃcient
Frontier in (lx, rx)-space.

This proposition is illustrated in Figure 1 above.
As H increases EF pivots upward from EF(H1)
to EF(H2). Thus the slope of EF has increased at
rx1 implying more growth for a given level of
risk. The new equilibrium (tangency point)
occurs to the left of the old implying a higher
equilibrium growth rate and a higher level of
equilibrium risk.
2.2. The entrepreneur’s optimisation strategy

will determine the curvature of the utility function and the tangency optimum.
4. We can think of H (among other things) as
also inﬂuencing initial resources of the entrepreneur (x0). Initial resources combined with a
decision on market positioning will determine
the expected growth rate of the ﬁrm through
time. Growth is measured alternatively by
proﬁts, equity value or utility as we shall see
later.
5. The entrepreneur also chooses at startup an ex
post exit rule which allows her to compare at
each point in time the value of continuing in
business, V(x(t)|.), with the value of switching
to an alternative activity worth W. This
enables her to decide optimally when to ‘fail’
i.e. to close the business solvently.l4
6. After these decisions have been made, chance
factors then take over to alter the actual trajectory experienced, and the actual decision, if
any, to exit the business at some point in
time.t
2.3. Entrepreneur’s optimisation problem
The entrepreneur is an expected utility maximiser
and chooses a function V(x(t)| h) to solve the following optimisation problem given his MHC:

VðxjhÞ ¼ max uðxÞ þ

1
E½Vðx þ dxjhÞ; W



The entrepreneur’s optimisation strategy has
several components:

ð8Þ15

1. Choose the market positioning parameter
h ¼ h * (a, k, H, l, r, c) to maximise
expected utility V{x(t) | lx (h), rx (h)} from
following an optimal policy i.e. to optimally
continue or close the business at any point in
time t.
2. This results in a choice of the expected growth
rate and risk of the ﬁrm relative to the market
{lx (h), rx (h)} and places the entrepreneur at
a position on the EF, given the parameter set
(a, k, H, l, r, c). This position may change
through time as e.g. H evolves.13
3. Note that the all-important management capital of the entrepreneur (H) plays a part in
determining determine the slope and position
of the EF at this initial stage. Attitudes to risk

where r is the appropriate risk-adjusted discount
rate, u(x) is the utility of current (known) proﬁts
x, the expectation is taken over the random increment dx given by equation (1), and W is the
present discounted value (p.d.v.) of the alternative activity open to the individual. The left hand
part of the term in curly brackets in (8) is the
value of continuing in business, given that market positioning is optimal; and the right hand
part (W) is the value of ceasing to trade.
Equation (8) says simply that if, once x is
realised in any period, the value of the return to
the alternative activity exceeds that to the current
business, the entrepreneur closes her business, i.e.
the business ‘fails’.16 Otherwise she continues
with the current activity.

We thus deﬁne failure as a situation where the
entrepreneur’s equity (or equivalently, discounted
entrepreneurial utility) falls to the opportunity
cost of staying in business.The relevant form of
the discounted utility of an owner of an existing
ﬁrm and whose value V(x) exceeds W, is
obtained by a straightforward application of Ito’s

Thus the optimal value function representing
the entrepreneur’s discounted utility value is
increasing concave in current proﬁts x. It will
therefore satisfy the second order condition with
appropriate assumptions about the parameters,
as we shall see below.
The general form for h* as a function of
model parameters is thus
h ¼ h ða; k; H; l; r; cÞ

<-----Page 6----->109

The comparative statics of this critical eﬀort
level with respect to proﬁt mean growth rate (l)
and variance (v) and risk aversion (c) are presented in Table I.19
From Table I we note, ﬁrstly, that for zero
growth l ¼ 0 we have h* ¼ 0 and so eﬀort, and
the eﬀect of any parameter on eﬀort, is zero.20
We observe also that a higher growth of the
market increases the amount of eﬀort in market
positioning as the entrepreneur, for given market risk, will now get a higher marginal return
from eﬀort in creating growth. On the other
hand, an increase in market risk (v) will
decrease the amount of eﬀort devoted to market
positioning and the ﬁrm’s growth rate, since the
marginal cost of growth measured by the higher
risk it incurs (rx), has now increased. Likewise,
if the entrepreneur becomes more risk averse
(c increases) the entrepreneur puts less eﬀort
into market positioning and will therefore grow
more slowly since the associated increase in
business risk (rx) is now more costly when measured in utility terms. Finally, higher management human capital entrepreneurs will put more
eﬀort into market positioning since this
increases growth opportunities at lower marginal
cost.
2.4. Firm’s equity value

Proposition 3: The ﬁrm’s equity value S(t) follows
a GBM dS/S with mean ls ¼ lx and variance
r2s ¼ r2x .
Proof. The proof for dS/S is a straightforward
application of the properties of the Lognormal
distribution. The expected level of the ﬁrm’s
proﬁts at time t in the future given that proﬁts x0
are earnt at startup (now) is:
ExðtÞ ¼ x0 elx t ¼ x0 elx ðt0Þ

(Aitcheson and Brown, 1957). This immediately
generalises to the level of proﬁts at time s in the
future starting from x(t) now:
ExðsÞ ¼ xðtÞelx ðstÞ ;

st

ð20Þ

Now the ﬁrm’s equity value at any time t, S(t),
will be the expected present discounted value of
the stream of proﬁts x(s) in the future:

SðtÞ ¼ E

Z1

xðsÞerðstÞ ds

ð21Þ

t

where r is the risk-adjusted discount rate.21 Using
(17) and integrating we get
SðtÞ ¼

To characterise the optimal switching rule and
the failure rate functions to be generated later we
need to know the nature of the process determining the ﬁrm’s equity value through time. It turns
out that under a GBM for proﬁts the ﬁrm’s
equity value will like proﬁts follow a GBM process. This is the content of

2.5. Entrepreneur’s discounted utility
We also need to know the nature of the process
determining the behaviour of the ﬁrm’s expected
utility from entrepreneurship through time, V(x).
This will enable us to derive a very intuitive form
for the function V(x) in terms of the expected

<-----Page 7----->110

Robert Cressy

growth rate of utility through time. Once more, a
simple GBM describes the process.

Proposition 4: Entrepreneur’s discounted utility
V(x) under CRRA utility
	 follows
 a GBM dV/v
with mean lv ¼ ð1  cÞ ls  2c r2s and variance
r2v ¼ ð1  cÞ2 r2s :
Proof. See Appendix.22(

Remark. This last result is intuitive: For
given risk attitudes, a higher growth rate of utility is possible the higher the ﬁrm’s equity growth
and the lower the risk associated with it. However, concern about risk (c) will reduce the
growth of utility from any given market positioning strategy by giving greater negative weight to
growth variability component in that strategy.
Caution also acts indirectly on utility growth by
preventing the entrepreneur growing her business
as fast as her more reckless colleagues with the
objective of avoiding extra risk associated with
that growth.
Proposition 4 also enables us to derive a different and intuitively appealing form for the
entrepreneur’s expected utility function under
continuation. We have
Corollary 4.1: The expected utility function for
continuing in business is V(x) ¼ u(x)/(rlv) where
x(t) is the value of x at time t and lv is the growth
rate of expected utility given in Proposition 4
above.
Proof. Use Propositions 4 and 2 together with
the deﬁnition of u(x) and the result follows. (

Remark 1. It is a well known feature of the
Random Walk that the best predictor of tomorrow’s value is today’s. Thus one might expect that
in utility terms the best predictor of tomorrow’s
satisfaction is today’s. This is precisely what Corollary 4.1 says when utility is expected to be constant over time (lv ¼ 0). For u(x) is not only
current utility at time t, it is also the expected one
period utility of the individual, viewed from period
t, for any period in the future. Hence if x is constant (or as here, is expected to be) then u(x)/r is
the p.d.v. of the stream of utility from x. Allowing
for growth in utility through time at an expected

proportional rate lv we get the adjusted discount
rate r-lv of the formula.23

2.5. Stopping sets
We have assumed that the stopping set is deﬁned
by V falling to W or below. It is well known,
however, that Brownian motion is continuous.
This implies that if utility crosses the line
V(t) ¼ W it will do so continuously rather than
in a discontinuous jump, and the entrepreneur
will switch to the alternative activity the instant
that V(t) ¼ W. Also, since we have shown that
there is a monotonic relationship between V, x
and S we can deﬁne the following switch point
equivalently in terms of x and S.
Let the entrepreneur’s reservation value in
terms of proﬁts x be deﬁned as x* (W, c, r, lv)
where
1

x ¼ ½Wð1  cÞðr  lv Þ1c solves Vðx Þ ¼ Cx1c

ð25Þ

and C is deﬁned by equation (17) above. Also let
the corresponding point in terms of equity be S*
where
S ¼

x
r  lx

ð26Þ

and x* is given by equation (27).

2.6. Stopping rule
We can state the above stopping rule in words
as:
CEASE TRADING (I.E. SWITCH TO THE
ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITY) WHEN AND
ONLY WHEN VðxÞ ¼ W (EQUIVALENTLY
x ¼ x or S ¼ S Þ; OTHERWISE CONTINUE
IN BUSINESS

ð27Þ

We can now prove a proposition about the form
of the failure time density implied by the present
model. It is a special case of a more general
result on GBM processes.

2.7. Distribution of failure times
We wish to derive the distribution of ﬁrm failure
times using the equation of evolution of the
ﬁrm’s equity which is GBM as shown in Proposition 3. We begin with a

Deﬁnition 3: A ﬁrm is said to fail the ﬁrst
time the entrepreneur’s equity value S(t) equals

Remark. In the language of the random
walk literature, the instant T that S(t) crosses
the boundary S* for the ﬁrst time is known as
the ﬁrst passage time.
We now present the results on the failure density
without proof (available from the Author on
request). They are straightforward following Cox
and Miller (1965).
The probability that the ﬁrm will fail by time
t, G(t|.), must now be of the form:

where F(z) is the Standard Normal c.d.f (see Cox
and Miller, 1965). Then the density of the time
to failure, g(t|.), is obtained by partially diﬀerentiating this expression with respect to t. We are
now ready to state

Proposition 5: The ﬁrm failure time density under
GBM, g(t\.) will be Inverse Gaussian.
Proof. Note that V follows a GBM so that
R ¼ log(S) will follow an Absolute Brownian
Motion (ABM) with parameters lR ¼ E½logðSÞ,
r2R ¼ var½log S. Diﬀerentiation of equation (28)

This expression will integrate to less than one if
l is positive since then eventual failure is not certain (see below). The density (29) is known as
the Inverse Gaussian density (Folks and Chhikara, 1978) and shows the probability of failure in
the interval (t, t + dt) given initial equity
R0 > 0.24 (
We can identify the conditions under which
this distribution has a maximum and under
which it is positively skewed. However, to see
that the density of equation (36) is positively
skewed under certain parameter values we illustrate with some simulations. (see Figure 3).
2.8. Long run failure rate
We deﬁne the long run failure rate of the ﬁrm as
the limiting value of g(t|.) as t tends to inﬁnity.

Figure 3a. Capitalisation and failure.

<-----Page 9----->112

Robert Cressy

This limit is zero regardless of the value of the
parameters. Thus starting with

Deﬁnition 5: The long run failure rate (LFR)
of ﬁrms is deﬁned as g(¥|R0)
we have
Proposition 6: The long run failure rate (LFR) of
all ﬁrms is zero.
Proof. Take limits in equation (29). (
2.9. Eﬀects of initial capitalisation
Figure 3 shows the eﬀect of varying the initial
equity level of the ﬁrm R0 on the failure curve.
Note that higher initial capitalisation is associated with (a) a delay in experiencing any risk at
all (the period before the probability of failure
becomes positive); (b) lower peak failure rates;
(c) no diﬀerences in the ‘long run’ probability of
failure. This suggests that only in the ‘short term’
is startup ﬁnance inﬂuential, and particularly in
the period after the ‘honeymoon’ (zero risk)
period is over. For low capitalisation ﬁrms the
honeymoon period is very short, and the risk
rises to very high levels relative to the long run.
We shall prove some exact results to support
these claims below.
2.10. Diﬀerences in growth rates
Figure.3b (not included) shows the variation of
the failure curve with growth rates. Note that the
higher growth is associated with a higher peak
failure rate though the honeymoon period is
unaﬀected. Again, in the long run the failure
rates for all ﬁrms converge on zero, though this
is not obvious from the ﬁgure.
2.11. Eﬀects of risk
Figure 3c (not included) shows the eﬀect of
varying the risk of the ﬁrm. Such variation is
consistent with human capital diﬀerences that
persist through time and concern the management of the ﬁrm’s returns. The graphs indicate
that (a) peak (short run) failure rates rise monotonically with risk; (b) the peak failure rate for a

higher-r ﬁrm occurs earlier than that of a low-r
ﬁrm; (c) the long run rates of failure converge
once more on zero.
2.12. Long run failure rate (LFR) and initial
conditions
Proposition 5 showed that as t tends to inﬁnity
the chances of failure, g(t|.), tend to zero. Thus
in the long run the initial conditions of the ﬁrm
become irrelevant to its success, and, provided it
survives a long enough period (particularly the
ﬁrst two years), it can be almost certain to continue further. This will depend critically on its
risk-return combination discussed above.
2.13. Lifetime failure probability (LFP)
Given the Inverse Gaussian form of the failure
density it is important to know the chances of
failure of the ﬁrm viewed from the outset (rather
than from a given time t from inception, considered in the previous paragraph). Supposing we
can formulate this probability, we want to know
how far the ﬁrm’s chances are inﬂuenced by its
parameters set at the startup stage.

Deﬁnition 6: The lifetime failure probability
(LFP), G, is the integral of the failure density
g(t|.) from t ¼ 0 to t ¼ ¥:
C¼

Z1

ð30Þ

gðtj:Þ dt

It can be shown that the LFP depends on the
sign of lR. Stationary or growing ﬁrms are not
certain to fail, i.e., for lR ‡ 0 we have G < 1
(Proposition 7 below).25 The chances of failure
over a complete lifetime will moreover depend
signiﬁcantly on the ﬁrm’s initial conditions,
growth rate and riskiness, and these in turn as
we shall show, are related to measures of human
capital. The results are stated formally in the
next two propositions.

Proposition 7: For growing or stationary ﬁrms,
lR ‡ 0, the lifetime failure probability
(LFP)

<-----Page 10----->Why do Most Firms Die Young?

and the opportunity cost of entrepreneurship
(R* ¼ log(S*)), and decreasing in the initial capital of the ﬁrm (R0) and the ﬁrm-speciﬁc growth
rate (lR). Finally the LFP is ambiguous in managerial human capital, being positively related to
initial capitalisation, risk, return and the opportunity cost of entrepreneurship.
Proof. For proof of the form of G(.) see Cox
and Miller (1965) or Ingersoll (1987). For the
comparative statics of the proposition diﬀerentiate G with respect to the relevant parameters,
bearing in mind the dependence of the ﬁrmspeciﬁc growth rate and variance on the other
parameters via h and stated in Table II. (

Remark 1: Table II shows that the LFR is
decreasing in the ﬁrm’s growth rate and increasing
in its risk. This reﬂects that fact that a greater
expected growth rate moves the ﬁrm away from
the failure threshold whereas a greater variance of
growth makes it more likely to cross it. The LFR
is also decreasing in initial capitalisation, as the
greater the initial capital buﬀer the less the likelihood that the ﬁrm will run out of money through
chance depletions (‘mistakes’). Finally, it is
ambiguous in human capital of the entrepreneur
since on the one hand the greater initial capitalisation and superior management of risk that this
aﬀords will make any given growth rate less likely
to result in failure, but on the other, higher MHC
will increase the opportunity cost of entrepreneurship, and increase the risk of the business.
Remark 2: The fact that start-up capital is positively related to survival does not necessarily
imply that it is ﬁnance itself that ensures survival.
Businesses run by more talented entrepreneurs will
on average start with higher ﬁnancial capital.26 A

policy of ‘throwing money at the problem’ will not
then be guaranteed to work, since the randomly
selected recipients of such ﬁnance may not know
how to use it eﬀectively.

3. Summary and conclusions
The paper developed a theoretical model of ﬁrm
growth under uncertainty to explain how managerial and ﬁnancial capital together with entrepreneurial risk aversion inﬂuence the entrepreneur’s
decision on market positioning and consequent
risk- return distribution faced. This in turn was
shown to determine the lifetime failure probability of the business. Drawing on three strands of
the existing literature, namely, the portfolio
approach to balancing risk and return, the Random Walk as a description of growth under
uncertainty and human capital as a determinant
of entrepreneurial, skills in risk-management, we
developed a model consistent with the observed
ﬁrm failure distribution. This distribution implies
that the chances of failure ﬁrst rise steeply and
then tail oﬀ gradually to converge on a small long
run failure rate. As a result, ‘most ﬁrms die
young’.
One explanation of the initial rise in the failure rate was that initial ﬁnancial resources were
depleted through time as a result of trading
losses and just bad luck. Another was the role of
managerial human capital which enabled the
more talented entrepreneur to grow faster at
lower cost measured by the increase in her ﬁrm’s
equity risk. This in turn reduced the chances of
equity falling below acceptable levels. However,
initial resources in the form of start-up equity
and managerial skills in the form of ﬁrm-speciﬁc
risk exposure were themselves fundamentally a
function of the human capital possessed by the
entrepreneur, as in Cressy (1996). As in Jovanovic
(1982) entrepreneurs in our model learn over
time trading but this occurs in an exogenous and
deterministic way rather than by updating of
priors. At the forefront of our model is the
choice of a risk-return combination for the business at each point on the entrepreneurial leaming
curve. Low human capital types tend to start
with too little human capital and to decide on
the ‘wrong’ combination (too high risk relative to
growth) and fail early. ill ﬁrms where the initial

<-----Page 11----->114

ﬁnancial capital was simply a windfall, the theory
predicts that the correlation of survival and
ﬁnance to be weaker, as the entrepreneur’s management capital would be unaltered by such
windfall’s, and thus the costs of growth, if high,
would remain so. Therefore the ﬁrm’s subsequent
fortunes might wane over time.
The theory assumed that ﬁrms’ equity value was
subject to random proportional shocks from some
initial level. Were all ﬁrms to grow at the same
(given) rate, this would mean that the riskiness of
the ﬁrm’s value would’ track the market and
increase over time. However, niche market opportunities allowed the ﬁrm to expend research eﬀort
to alter the risk-return relationship experienced by
the ﬁrm itself. Entrepreneurial risk aversion then
interacted with this to produce an optimal tradeoﬀ
between the ﬁrm’s actual growth and risk.
The model emphasised the importance of risk
in ﬁrm failure. However, closure under risk is
modelled as a rational decision by the entrepreneur and is not therefore cause for alarm. The
closure decision of the entrepreneur was characterised (as in Jovanovic,1982) by a cutoﬀ value
that equated the ﬁrm’s current equity to the
entrepreneur’s outside opportunity. We showed
that the entrepreneur’s value function will contain a stopping rule allowing the entrepreneur to
time the ‘switch’ optimally. Closure is also
socially optimal rather than the result of ﬁnancial
market imperfections.
However, the role of uncertainty in the model
does suggest that the censorious attitudes to
small business failure embodied in the UK’s
bankruptcy laws should be toned down: if chance
plays such a potentially important role in the
occurrence and timing of failure, and is by deﬁnition unanticipated and outside the control of the
entrepreneur, a sympathetic understanding of
unfortunate (‘unlucky’) individuals is more sensible response than social opprobrium.

Notes
1
Bruderl, et al., (1992) found that for German startups,
24% went out of business in the ﬁrst 2 years, 37% in the
ﬁrst 5 years of trading; Cressy (1996) found for UK startups
that 45% died in the ﬁrst 2.5 years of trading and 80% in
the ﬁrst 6 years; Mata (1992) found that for Portuguese
startups 20% died in the ﬁrst year and 50% in the ﬁrst
4 years. The average size of the startups in these samples is
very small, bring always less than ﬁve employees.
2
Cressy (1993) for example, records that some 45% of
businesses die in the ﬁrst 2.5 years of trading, implying an
annual failure rate of some 18%. This rate reduces dramatically to about 11% per annum for ﬁrms of 5 years of age.
3
Startup ﬁrms are notoriously risk-prone measured along
almost any dimension: in particular number of products, customers and suppliers are typically very small, making the ﬁrm
highly vulnerable to changes in the environment.
4
Kihlstrom and Laﬀont (1979) are an exception to this
general rule. Their theory of entrepreneurship is based on
uncertainty and diﬀerences in risk aversion amongst potential
entrepreneurs.
5
Jovanovic (1982) regards entrepreneurship itself as a
learning experiment in which the entrepreneur continuously
updates information on his ability during the course of the
business ‘experiment’. Her ability is ﬁxed and, entrepreneurship is regarded as a process of discovery of its true value
over time. We note that (a) Jovanovic’s model does not allow
the entrepreneur to inﬂuence the rate at which he learns (there
is no learning by doing – see Ericson and Pakes, 1995), (b)
there is no risk aversion informing the entrepreneur’s decision
on her growth rate, (c) learning has no cost to the entrepreneur, and (d) there is no initial dispersion of entrepreneurial
ability – see Frank (1986). In the model presented below the
entrepreneur by contrast does inﬂuence her growth rate (via
market positioning) and this choice will partly depend on her
attitudes towards risk. Her growth rate will also be inﬂuenced
by her endowment of management human capital (which may
vary deterministically over time) Entrepreneurs diﬀer in their
cost of achieving growth where this cost is logically measured
in terms of the disutility of the extra risk it involves. This in
turn has a dynamic eﬀect, changing the whole distribution of
income and failure risk through time as it inﬂuences the
growth trajectory and ﬁrms’ risk parameters. In line with the
empirical facts (Cressy, 1996) we also allow for the dispersion
of human capital at the point of entry into entrepreneurship.
6
Firm-speciﬁc risk matters to an entrepreneur since (s)he
typically has a highly undiversiﬁed portfolio of assets.
7
See also Parker (1996) for an application of a Merton portfolio approach to the self-employment vs. employee decision.
8
A little known fact about small business is that most
businesses do not fail as a result of bankruptcy, rather they
close voluntarily. Even in a deeply recessionary environment
such as the UK experienced in the early 90s, the proportion
of bankrupt/insolvent closures rose to only 20% of the total
(Cressy, 1993).

Empirical studies that have refuted Gibrat’s law have
found that ﬁrm growth and survival vary inversely and
directly respectively with the age of the ﬁrm (i e. time trading). We control for human capital as a function of age when
imposing Gibrat’s law and thus the assumption is weaker
than might otherwise be thought.

The assumption that the systematic component of ﬁrm
growth is zero is consistent with a number of studies that
have shown the typical small ﬁrm’s growth rate to be close to
zero. For example, Storey et al., (1987) and Watson (1990).
12
Businessmen often argue that they eliminate as much risk
as possible and leave therefore only a ‘calculated’ risk to their
business. See Delmar (l995) for a description of such entrepreneurial psychology from Swedish case studies.
13
Cressy (l996) shows that managerial human capital is a
concave function of the average age of the team running the
business with a maximum in the mid-50s.
14
The empirical evidence shows that the great majority of
small businesses do not fail through bankruptcy, contrary to
common belief. This is because the majority do not borrow
from their bank.
15
Equation (6) is the Bellman equation of dynamic programming. See Dixit and Pindyck (1994, p. 105).
16
It is important to recognise that most business closures
do not involve bankruptcies or insolvencies, nor do they on
average result in trade sales. See Cressy (1996).

We assume in equation (12) thaI V¢ > 0 and V¢¢ < 0.
This will be proved later.

We shall see later that this is equivalent to assuming that
the growth of expected utility is positive.

any parameter z which takes the form:

The exception is the parameter l which yields indeterminate results for l ¼ 0.

We assume in this derivation that all proﬁts are distributed to shareholders. This implies there is no carry-forward

It is clear from Corollary 4.1 that we need the expected
growth in utility (lv) to be less than the rate of interest to
ensure convergence.

g(t|.) is strictly not a density if l is not restricted in sign.
However, to save space in what follows we shall refer to it as

Cressy (1996) in a UK empirical study shows that human
and ﬁnancial capital are positively correlated and that once
human capital is controlled for, ﬁnancial capital becomes
irrelevant in the survival equation.
