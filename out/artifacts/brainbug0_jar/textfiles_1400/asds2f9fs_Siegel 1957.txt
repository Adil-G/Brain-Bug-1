LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DECISION MAKING
SIDNEY SIEGEL
Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences 2

The purpose of this paper is to discuss two related topics: (a) the role of
a person's level of aspiration in his decision making, and (b) the measurement
of level of aspiration in a decision-theory context. The discussion of the second topic will include a brief summary
of some experimental evidence which
lends support to the methodological
stand taken here.
The notion of level of aspiration is
invoked in reference to the goal-striving
behavior of an individual when he is
presented with a task whose outcome
can be measured on an achievement
scale. Level of aspiration refers to the
particular achievement goal for which
the person strives.
The concept of level of aspiration was
introduced by Dembo (8), and the first
experiment in the area was conducted
by Hoppe (14). It is a familiar concept to psychologists and others, having
been the topic of extensive discussion
and experimentation in the last quarter
of a century. An early review of the
literature is given by Frank (13). Rotter has offered a critical review of the
methodological aspects of level of aspiration studies (19). An exceptionally
important theoretical article, by Lewin,
Dembo, Festinger, and Sears, appeared
in 1944 (16).

DECISION THEORY AND LEVEL OF
ASPIRATION THEORY
It is the contention of the present
writer that the psychological situation
established in level of aspiration experiments may profitably be characterized
as a decision situation, for from the alternative possible goals the individual
must decide for which goal he will
strive.
It is a remarkable fact that, by a
simple change in nomenclature, the theoretical model used by Lewin et al. (16)
in the prediction of the choices (decisions) of individuals in a goal-striving
situation—a model based on the work
of Escalona (11) and Festinger (12)—
may be rendered fundamentally equivalent to the theoretical model employed
by decision and game theorists. This
latter theory, first advanced by Bernoulli
(2), discussed by Ramsey (18), and
formalized by Von Neumann and Morgenstern (28) and by Savage (20),
states that under conditions of uncertainty individuals behave as if they were
attempting to maximize expected utility.
According to these and other decision
theorists, an individual's decisions underlying his choices among alternatives
involving uncertain outcomes (outcomes
with stated probabilities of attainment)
are based on the utilities of the entities
(objects, actions, goals, etc.) and on the
probabilities (subjective probabilities,
for most decision theorists) associated
with attainment of the entities. The
decisions are a function of these two
variables (utility and . subjective probability) in that the individual seeks by
his choices to maximize the sum of the
products of probability and utility, i.e.,

253

<-----Page 1----->254

SIDNEY SIEGEL

he acts so as to maximize
SEU = £ piUi,
i

where SEU is subjectively expected utility (cf. [10]).
Equivalence of terms. Lewin et al.
assert that the level of aspiration set by
the person is a function of three factors: (a) "the seeking of success," (b)
"the avoiding of failure," and (c) the
"cognitive factor of a probability judgment" (16, p. 376). The last-mentioned factor refers to the individual's
subjective probability of achieving a
goal. (Lewin et al. use the term "subjective probability." See [16] p. 361
et seq.) Each of these three concepts
of Lewinian theory may be "translated"
directly to an equivalent concept in decision theory. The achievement scale
may be thought of as a utility scale,
where utility refers to the subjective
value of an entity (goal, action, object)
as distinguished from its objective or
"face" value. It is the contention of
this paper that each level on an achievement scale has a certain utility for a
person, and that therefore level of aspiration may be conceived as a "point"
on a scale of utility. An achievement
which represents "success" in Lewinian
terms may be thought of in decision theory terms as one which has "positive
utility." An achievement which represents "failure" to the person may be
thought of as having "negative utility"
for him. And the Lewinian notion of
"subjective probability" needs no translation, for the same term is used in decision theory.
The demonstration that certain concepts in Lewinian level of aspiration theory are equivalent to certain key concepts in decision theory is important because of the consequences it may have.
Because of these equivalences, two important bodies of research literature may
be synthesized, with benefit to both.

The benefit to traditional psychologists,
accustomed to dealing with terms like
"success" and "failure," will accrue because of the much greater formality and
rigor characteristic of decision theory, a
rigor unknown to many psychologists.
The benefit to decision theory will come
because the synthesis will render available to decision theorists a large amount
of existing experimental evidence with
relevance to their work which has not
yet been recognized by them.
Equivalence of formal statements of
relations. The similarity between the
two theories does not rest with equivalence of their variables. Also comparable are the formal statements of the
relations among these variables.
For example, Lewin et al. (16, p. 360)
state that:
The individual faces the possibility of succeeding
or failing and the positive or negative valence of
such a future success or failure on the various
levels is one of the basic elements for the decision.
To determine the valence (Va) of each level (n)
of activity [Va (An}~] we have to consider the
negative valence that future failure has on that
level [Fa (Fai An}~] and the positive valence of
success on that level [Va (Sue An)~].
Va (A") = Va (Sue A") + Va (Fai A").

When discussing the individual's felt
probability of success (16, p. 362), they
also state that:
The most simple assumption is that this
"weighted" valence of success [_°Va (Sue An)~]
is the product of the valence and the probability
of success
°Va (Sue A") = Va (Sue A^-Prob (Sue A").
The corresponding formula for failure is:
°Va (Fai A") = Va (Fai A") • Prob (FaiAn).

If Lewin et al. had proceeded to the logical
conclusion of these ideas, they could
have stated that
Expected Va (An] = Prob (Sue A")
•Va (Sue A") + [(/ - Prob)
X (Sue An)JVa (Fai X")],

<-----Page 2----->LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DECISION MAKING
which in decision theory terms is given as
Expected Utility = Probability Utility
of Success + (/ — Probability)
• Utility• jo/ Failure
in which it is asserted that the individual chooses among alternatives (sometimes called "courses of action") so as
to maximize expected utility.
This formula is equivalent to that
given by Von Neumann and Morgenstern (28), and has been utilized in
studies of decision behavior by Davidson, Siegel, and Suppes (7), Hosteller
and Nogee (17), Siegel (21), Hurst
and Siegel (15), Edwards (10), and
others (see [9]).
In the discussion of Lewin et al., the
problem of obtaining a rigorous measurement of utility (degree of valence)
and of subjective probability is virtually disregarded, despite the fact that
these are the variables upon which the
entire structure of the model depends.
In the literature of decision theory, on
the other hand, attention has been given
to this important facet. See, for example, the experiments by Hosteller and
Nogee (17) and by Davidson, Siegel,
and Suppes (7) on the measurement of
utility in an interval scale and on the
measurement of subjective probability,
and also those of Siegel (21) and
Coombs and Komorita (6) on the meas-'
urement of utility on an ordered metric
scale.
Another contrast between the two
theories rests on the fact that in decision
theory the formal theoretical models are
based on a set of assertions from which
consequences can be derived by logicomathematical arguments. The assertions are referred to as axioms of the
system (cf. [20]). If the model is used
to interpret "real world" phenomena, it
is possible to know, without ambiguity,
what aspect of the model is analogous
to what thing (or action) in the real
world.

255

When such an abstract and formal
system is available, it sometimes happens that the mathematical system will
serve as a model for more than one
situation in the real world. This fortuitous event may reveal analogies or relations of whose existence scientists were
previously unaware. This seems to be
the case in the present instance. A formal theoretical model has been constructed which is useful in interpreting
decision behavior in general. It is contended in this paper that this model will
encompass decision behavior in goalstriving or achievement situations, i.e.,
in situations where level of aspiration is
an important variable of behavior, and
furthermore that level of aspiration may
usefully be defined in decision-theory
terms and measured in a decision-theory
context.
LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AS A DETERMINANT IN DECISION HAKING
Suppose an individual is given the
task of finding as many as he can of
five hidden objects, which will be his to
keep. Suppose further that this individual aspires to find and thereby acquire at least four of these. That is,
the acquisition of four or more of the
objects is defined as "success" by this
individual, and the acquisition of any
fewer will constitute "failure" for him.
Now suppose that before he attempts to
find the objects, he is asked to choose
between the following alternatives: (a)
a SO-SO chance of getting either four of
the objects or none of the objects, or
(b) assurance of getting three of the objects. That is, suppose that the outcome of the task is completely determined by the individual's choosing either
of the alternatives above and then by
the toss of a "fair" coin. If the individual chooses Alternative (a) above,
and if the coin lands "heads" he gets
four objects, whereas if it lands "tails"
he gets none at all. On the other hand,

<-----Page 3----->256

SIDNEY SIEGEL

if he chooses (b) he gets three objects
if the coin lands at either heads or tails.
Now since the individual has set the
acquisition of four objects as his level
of aspiration, and the acquisition of any
fewer will be considered as a "failure"
by him, it seems clear that he will choose
Alternative ( a ) , despite the fact that
objectively Alternative (b) has greater
expected value. In other words, Alternative (b) may have greater expected
value, but Alternative (a) has greater
expected utility for this person. His
level of aspiration has made the utility
of the objects nonlinear with their objective value.
In game-theory terms, the above situation may be described as a one-person
game in which the subject chooses between two alternatives, each of which is
a probability-combination of two outcomes. The format for the game is:

If heads occurs
If tails occurs

Alternative (a)

Alternative (6)

you get 4
you get 0

you get 3.
you get 3.

The subject chooses the column; the
outcome of the toss of the coin determines the row.
Now if the subject has Level of Aspiration 4, and if therefore he chooses
Alternative (a) over ( b ) , this tells us
that for this individual the difference in
utility between 4 and 3 objects is greater
than the difference between 3 and 0.
That conclusion is based on this reasoning: if

If p is understood to be subjective probability, and is known to be one-half,
then Statement 2 may be written

«(4) + «(0) > «(3) + «(3)

(3)

and
«(4) - «(3) > «(3) - *(0). (4)
That is, when Alternative (a) is preferred, we may infer that Statement 4
above is true, i.e., that the difference in
utility between 4 and 3 objects is larger
than the difference in utility between 3
andO (21, pp. 212-213).
We can see from the above that for
this individual the acquisition of four or
more objects has positive utility. The
acquisition of three or fewer has negative utility. Zero utility is represented
by some point between three and four.
It should also be noticed that the level
of aspiration is associated with the
largest difference on the utility scale.
We may cite another example to illustrate the same points. Suppose a student is enrolled in a course in which he
aspires for the grade of B. Before the
examination on which the course grade
is based, he is asked to choose between
the following alternatives:

If Event
E occurs
If Event
Non-E occurs

Alternative (a)

Alternative (6)

you get an A

you get a B.

you get a C

you get a B.

If the individual believes that the probability of the occurrence of Event E is
( 1 ) .50, it seems clear that he will choose
Alternative ( b ) , since his level of aspirawhere u(x) is read as "the utility of ac- tion is to achieve a grade of B. By this
quiring x objects" and interpreted to choice, the individual demonstrates to us
mean the subjective value of x, i.e., its that the difference in utility between B
worth to the person, then Statement 1 and C is greater than the difference in
can be written
utility between A and B. That is, on
his utility scale B is closer to A than to
-#)-«(3). (2) C. See Fig. 1.
Expected Utility of (a)
> Expected Utility of ( b ) ,

<-----Page 4----->LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DECISION MAKING

Fro. 1.

Now the same person is asked to
choose between these:

If Event
E occurs
If Event
Non-E occurs

Alternative (a)

Alternative (6)

you get a B

you get a C.

you get a D

you get a C.

If his subjective probability toward
Event E is .50, he will choose Alternative (a), for in terms of his level of
aspiration any grade less than B is a
"failure." His selection of Alternative
(a) demonstrates that for him the difference in utility between Grades B and
C is larger than that between C and D,
as shown in Fig. 2. Again we see that
the level of aspiration is associated with
the upper bound of the largest distance
on the utility scale.

257

Each of the characteristics of level of
aspiration enumerated above is incorporated in the following formal and more
rigorous definition of level of aspiration:
The level of aspiration of an individual is a point in the positive region
of his utility scale of an achievement
variable; it is at the least upper bound
of that chord (connecting two goals)
which has maximum slope; i.e., the level
of aspiration is associated with the higher
of the two goals between which the rate
of change of the utility function is a
maximum.
It may be seen from this definition
that the difference in utility between
achieving at the level of aspiration or
achieving at the next lower level is
greater than is the difference in utility
between achieving at the level of aspiration or achieving at the next higher
level. In other words, the level of
aspiration is that goal which has the
U(A)

LEVEL OF ASPIRATION DEFINED
Before we offer a formal definition of
the level of aspiration, we may summarize what has been said above concerning it:
1. The level of aspiration of an individual is a position on his utility scale
of an achievement variable.
2. The lower bound of that position
is neutral in utility, i.e., all points below the lower bound have negative utility (psychological feeling of dissatisfaction) associated with them and all points
above the lower bound have positive
utility (psychological feeling of satisfaction) associated with them.
3. The level of aspiration is associated with the upper bound of the largest
distance on the utility scale.

largest distance (difference) in utility
between it and the next lower goal.
Figure 3 demonstrates this graphically.
The curve represents the utility function of a student who aspired for a B
and who made the choices discussed
above, among others. It may be seen
that the differences between the utility
of B, U(B), and the utility C, U(C),
is larger than any of the other differences. The ordered metric utility function may also be represented as it is
shown in Fig. 4.
LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AS A PROBLEM
IN MEASUREMENT
The preceding discussion is directed
to the point that under certain conditions the task of ascertaining an individual's level of aspiration reduces to
the task of measuring his utility of the
goals in question. That is, when an
achievement variable is involved, the
level of aspiration on the achievement
scale may be derived by ascertaining
the individual's utility function for the
goals in question.
How strong must the measurement be?
Obviously the weaker sorts of measurement—nominal and ordinal scaling—
will not be satisfactory, for such scaling
yields no information about the distances between the entities on the scale.
Since the identification of level of aspiration requires some knowledge of the
distances on the scale, utility must be
measured on a stronger scale than an
ordinal one.
The strength of measurement which
is required depends on the nature of
the variate—on whether the possible
achievement goals are represented by a
continuous variate or are a discrete set
of entities with an underlying continuum.

If the possible goals are on a continuum and if the achievement scale is
represented by a continuous variate, i.e.,
if the scores (goals) may have any value
in a certain range, then at least interval measurement of utility is necessary
to derive level of aspiration. In interval measurement, the distances between
points (i.e., the intervals) are known
numerically (22, 26, 27), and thus the
numerically largest distance may be
identified and the level of aspiration
thereby located.
If the possible goals are discontinuous and if the achievement scale consists
of a discrete set of entities, i.e., if the
scores (goals) can take only isolated
values, then at least ordered metric
measurement is necessary to derive level
of aspiration. In strength, an ordered
metric scale falls between an ordinal
scale and an interval scale. An ordered
metric scale (4, 5, 21) not only gives a
ranking of the entities involved but also
a ranking of the distances between the
entities. With an ordered metric scale
we can identify the largest distance and,
inasmuch as the individual's choice is
limited to the discrete set of goals available, we thereby find that goal which
best represents his level of aspiration of
those available.
The problem of obtaining an interval
measure of utility has been dealt with
by Davidson, Siegel, and Suppes (7).
Their paper includes an axiomatization
of the interval measurement of utility
as well as a report of an experiment in
which interval scales of utility were successfully derived for IS subjects.
A method for obtaining an ordered
metric measure of utility has been developed by Siegel (21). Examples of
applications of this method in tests of
various hypotheses are given in (15),
(23), and (24).
Most level-of-aspiration situations, if
not all, involve a discrete set of goals.
Even if there is continuity underlying

<-----Page 6----->LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DECISION MAKING
the achievement scale, as is the case
in achievement in throwing darts at a
board with a bull's-eye, the possible
goals are usually broken up into a discrete set. In the case of the dart board,
these are concentric circles around the
bull's-eye. Thus it would seem that for
most situations measurement in an ordered metric scale is all that is necessary to derive an individual's level of
aspiration.
To test the validity of the statement
that the level of aspiration is that goal
which is the least upper bound of the
largest distance on an ordered metric
scale of utility, a study was conducted
which is reported fully elsewhere (1).
A summary report of it is included here
to lend greater clarity to some of the
topics discussed.
EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION
Becker and Siegel (1) have conducted
a study wherein they tested the hypothesis that the ordered metric utility
function would yield information on the
individual's level of aspiration.
Subjects were 20 students enrolled in
an elementary course in statistics. These
were students who volunteered to gamble with the instructor for their midterm grade, with the understanding that
the grade they obtained in the gambling
session would be entered in the course
records in lieu of their score on the
regularly scheduled midterm examination.3 An ordered metric scale of the
grades A, B, C, D, and F was derived
for each subject by the method described
elsewhere (1, 21). This method derives
the subject's scale from his choices
among alternatives like those exampled
above.
3
After all data had been collected, the nature of the experiment was explained to all
participants in individual interviews with
them, and all agreed to take the examination
and receive a grade based on their performance on it.

259

The subjects were required to make
choices between alternatives in a number of offers. Each of the offers was
numbered, and the subjects understood
in advance that the offer on which the
pay-off (midterm grade) would be based
would be selected at random from all of
the offers given. Therefore each decision they made had an equal likelihood
of being the crucial one on which their
midterm grade depended (cf. 21, p. 214;
20, p. 29).
After the subjects had made all the
required choices, two ruses were introduced. First, the allegedly random
device by which each student's grade
would be determined was actually controlled so that each subject "won" a C
for his grade. Some subjects responded
to this pay-off with considerable dismay
and disappointment. In response to this,
the experimenters perpetrated the second
ruse. The group of subjects was told
that if they were dissatisfied with the
grade they had won, they could obtain
an interview with the instructor and the
other experimenter, in which perhaps
some way of raising their grade could
be worked out. The implication contained in this announcement was that
performance of extra work would be the
mode of raising the grade. The subjects
were told that any who desired such an
interview would have to wait until the
instructor placed an urgent long-distance telephone call, after which he and
the other experimenter would return to
conduct individual interviews with those
students who desired them. The instructor said he would return in about
five minutes, but actually his absence
was unexplainedly extended to an hour's
time before he returned for individual
interviews. As will become clear, this
ruse permitted a test of one of the hypotheses of the study.
The interviews were structured to obtain a careful independent measure of
each subject's level of aspiration for

<-----Page 7----->260

SIDNEY SIEGEL

his midterm grade. Both experimenters
were present, and their independent
judgments of each subject's level of aspiration were in very close agreement
(ra = .99). The interviews were conducted before either experimenter had
any information concerning any subject's ordered metric scale of utility for
grades.
The experiment was designed to test
two hypotheses. For this summary it
may suffice to state these briefly and to
report the outcome of each hypothesis
test.
Hypothesis I was that those subjects
who would not wait for an interview
with the instructor would be persons on
whose ordered metric scales the largest
distance was between D and F—persons
whose ordered metric scales would reveal that their level of aspiration was
below the C which they had won. This
hypothesis was supported by the data.
Four subjects left the room before the
experimenters returned from their hourlong errand. All had ordered metric
scales with the largest distance between
D and F. Seemingly they were satisfied
with the C grade they had been assured
and therefore saw no reason to seek an
interview.
Hypothesis II was that subjects' levels of aspiration, as determined from
their ordered metric scales of utility,
would be positively correlated with their
levels of aspiration as judged from the
interview material. This hypothesis was
confirmed: the correlation between the
two independent indices of level of aspiration was rs = .83.
GOALS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Child and Whiting (3, p. 508) have
formulated five general statements which
contain the conclusions which may reasonably be drawn from research on level
of aspiration to date:
1. Success generally leads to a raising of the
level of aspiration, and failure to a lowering.

2. The stronger the success, the greater is
the probability of a rise in level of aspiration;
the stronger the failure, the greater is the probability of a lowering.
3. Shifts in level of aspiration are in part a
function of changes in the subject's confidence
in his ability to attain goals.
4. Failure is more likely than success to lead
to withdrawal in the form of avoiding of setting a level of aspiration.
5. Effects of failure on level of aspiration
are more varied than those of success.

Each of these generalizations may be
treated as hypotheses to be tested in experimentation employing the decisiontheory approach outlined here. If such
experimentation leads to confirmation of
the hypotheses, this would strengthen
confidence in the validity of that approach.
Simon (25, p. 110) points out that in
most models of rational choice it is assumed that the individual will evaluate
the outcomes of all possible alternatives
before he makes any choice. In realistic human situations requiring decision,
however, alternatives often must be examined sequentially and decisions must
be made as the alternatives are presented. When this is the case, and when
the individual does not know what variables determine the order of the offers
(and therefore does not know whether
the future alternatives are likely to be
"better" or "worse" than those with
which he has already been confronted),
he may well choose the first satisfactory
alternative which is offered. In the
terms of the present paper, the individual may choose the first alternative
containing an outcome at or above his
level of aspiration. The techniques suggested in this paper could be used to
provide an empirical test of this hypothesis.
Simon offers another interesting hypothesis which might be tested in the
context of the present approach. As the
individual is being presented with a sequence of choice situations, he may find

<-----Page 8----->LEVEL OF ASPIRATION AND DECISION MAKING
that it is easy for him to discover satisfactory alternatives among them. If so,
his level of aspiration will rise. On the
other hand, he may find it difficult to
discover satisfactory alternatives among
those made available to him, and in this
case his level of aspiration will fall.
Simon suggests that such changes in
level of aspiration would tend to guarantee the existence of satisfactory solutions to the decision situation, for failure to discover initially satisfying alternatives would depress the level of
aspiration and thereby bring satisfactory solutions into existence.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper suggests that Lewinian
theory concerning level of aspiration
may be integrated with certain parts of
decision theory. An achievement scale
may be viewed as a scale of utility of
the achievement goals. A formal definition of level of aspiration in terms of
utility is offered. The problem of ascertaining a person's level of aspiration reduces to the problem of measuring his
utility of the achievement goals. It is
hypothesized that level of aspiration is
associated with the largest distance on
an individual's utility scale. If this is
so, with a discrete set of goals, ordered
metric measurement is sufficient for
identifying a person's level of aspiration,
since an ordered metric scale contains
not only a ranking of the entities
(achievement goals) but also a ranking
of the distances between them. Certain experimental evidence which supports the hypothesis is summarized.
Suggestions for future research are presented; these draw upon the ideas presented here, together with those of other
workers in the fields of level of aspiration and decision theory.
In conclusion, it would seem that a
useful behavioral model of decision making should include not only the concepts
of utility and subjective probability, as

261

do the present models, but should also
include a formulation of the effects of
level of aspiration and reinforcement on
utility. That is, the model should include recognition that utility has a
model in its own right, in which the
main concepts are level of aspiration
(LA) and reinforcement effects (R).
In terms of such an extended model,
it may be said that if various alternatives are available to an individual, he
will choose from among these alternatives, toward each of which he has a
subjective probability of attainment and
a utility, so as to maximize subjectively
expected utility, SEU. That is, the individual will choose so as to maximize
SEU =
