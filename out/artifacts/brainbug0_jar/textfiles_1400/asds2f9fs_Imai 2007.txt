Although scholars have repeatedly touted the practical importance of being able to
negotiate effectively across cultures, paradoxically, no study has directly addressed what
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness. In this thesis, we examined the role of
cultural intelligence (CQ) as a potential predictor of intercultural negotiation
effectiveness. The negotiation transcripts of 124 American and East Asian negotiators (62
dyads) were coded for joint sequencing of integrative behaviors as well as sequencing of
cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ measured a week prior to
negotiations, and aggregated to the dyad level, predicted the extent to which negotiators
sequenced integrative behaviors, which in turn predicted joint profit. CQ predicted
integrative sequences over and beyond international experience, openness, extraversion,
empathy, cognitive ability and emotional intelligence. Exploratory analyses revealed that
the motivational facet of CQ had particularly strong predictive power, and that the
minimum CQ score within the dyad was enough to predict integrative sequences.

<-----Page 8----->Chapter 1: Introduction
In this era of globalization, it is critical that organizational researchers understand
how culture influences negotiation behavior for both practice and theory. Negotiating
effectively across cultures is a critical skill for businesspeople, as it is a crucial aspect of
many inter-organizational relationships, including strategic alliances, joint ventures,
mergers and acquisitions, licensing and distribution agreements, and sales of products
and services (Adler, 2002; Cai & Drake, 1998). It is those people that understand how
culture influences negotiation that will have a competitive advantage in todayâs global
marketplace (Gelfand & Christakopoulou, 1999). In addition to this practical concern,
there is a theoretical impetus for culture and negotiation research. Historically, research
in negotiation has tended to be largely culture-blind; it generally did not pay attention to
the cultural context in which it was rooted. Furthermore, negotiation research has tended
to be culture-bound, with many theories tested and developed only in Western cultural
contexts (Berry, 1978; Gelfand & Dyer, 2000; Smith & Bond, 1999). The field is
increasingly recognizing that it is problematic to assume that negotiation theories and
findings are universal when Western cultures only encompass approximately 30% of
humankind (Triandis, 1994).
Despite the importance of such pursuits, however, there is a fundamental paradox
in the culture and negotiation literature. Even though the practicality of being able to
negotiate effectively with people from different cultures is used to justify the need to
develop cross-cultural theory, the vast majority of research remains comparative (Adler
& Graham, 1989; Brett & Okumura, 1998). In other words, with some exceptions (Adair,
Okumura, & Brett 2001; Adler & Graham, 1989; Brett & Okumura, 1998; Cai, Drake, &
1

<-----Page 9----->Wilson, 2000; Natlandsmyr & Rognes, 1995), research focuses on comparing different
negotiation behaviors across cultures, but of behaviors as they occur in mono-cultural
settings, instead of directly examining intercultural settings where cultural barriers exist
across the negotiation table. Implicit to this comparative approach is the researcherâs
assumption that people behave similarly to other negotiators from foreign cultures as they
do with those from their own culture, yet there is evidence showing this is not the case
(e.g. Adair et al., 2001; Adler & Graham, 1989). If practice is to truly benefit from
theory, more attention needs to be paid to intercultural negotiations. In reviewing the
most recent and comprehensive handbook of negotiation and culture (Gelfand & Brett,
2004), Kray (2005) observes, âalthough researchers have identified a host of crosscultural differences in styles and preferences, negotiation scholars might consider
expanding beyond simple demonstrations of differencesâ¦and explore whether awareness
of these differences makes a differenceâ¦knowledge about factors influencing the
effectiveness of intercultural negotiations is sparseâ (p.159). Indeed, as of yet, the culture
and negotiation literature reveals little as to what characteristics negotiators can be
selected and or trained upon in order to maximize the chances of reaching optimal
agreements in negotiations that traverse cultural borders.
As such, the focus of this study was to take an individual differences approach to
see if a newly developed construct, cultural intelligence (CQ), defined as an individualâs
capability to adapt effectively to situations of cultural diversity (Earley & Ang, 2003),
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness, over and beyond other similar yet distinct
interpersonal constructs including international experience (travel and living
experiences), personality (openness, extraversion, empathy), and other forms of

2

<-----Page 10----->intelligence (emotional intelligence and cognitive ability). We reasoned that because CQ
is a concept that specifically deals with a personâs skill level in overcoming cultural
barriers, it holds promise as a useful predictor in the context of intercultural negotiations.
More specifically, we examined whether intercultural dyads with higher CQ as compared
with dyads with lower CQ would achieve higher negotiation outcomes, namely joint
profit and relational capital (Gelfand, Major, Raver, Nishii, & OâBrien, 2006) by way of
integrative sequencing of information behaviors as well as sequencing of cooperative
relationship management behaviors. In addition, we explored the dyad composition of
CQ, that is, whether it takes one or two high CQ negotiators to achieve such effective
negotiation processes and outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, no other research has
directly addressed our broader question, what predicts intercultural negotiation
effectiveness?
By examining intercultural negotiation âeffectivenessâ not only in terms of
negotiation outcomes but also in terms of sequencing of behaviors that lead to these
outcomes, we also make a contribution to the negotiation process literature in addition to
the cross-cultural literature. We move beyond the predominant paradigm of just looking
at the effects of an unexamined negotiation input, CQ, on negotiation outcomes
(Weingart & Olekalns, 2004), but pay much-needed attention to the dynamic negotiation
process through which CQ exerts its effects in intercultural contexts.
In the following sections, we first review empirical findings from a handful of
studies on intercultural negotiation that does exist in the literature, focusing on how and
why bargaining in intercultural contexts are challenging. Second, we review the literature
on negotiation processes and argue that coordinated and synchronized behavior that is

3

<-----Page 11----->difficult to achieve but required for effective intercultural negotiation involves strategic
sequencing of integrative information behaviors as well as cooperative relationship
management behaviors. Finally, we discuss the construct of CQ, review empirical
findings, and present our theory as to why CQ may improve intercultural negotiation
effectiveness by way of sequencing integrative information behaviors as well as
relationship management behaviors.
Intercultural Negotiations: Why are they so Difficult?
There are only a few studies in the culture and negotiation literature that directly
examine negotiations in intercultural settings. A consistent finding from what evidence
does exist, however, is that joint profit, or mutually beneficial outcomes are harder to
achieve in intercultural than intracultural settings. For example, Adler & Graham (1989)
found that joint profits were reduced for the Japanese when negotiating with Americans
than when negotiating with other Japanese. Similarly, joint profits were lower for
Anglophone Canadians when negotiating with Francophone Canadians than when
negotiating within their own cultural group. Natlandsmyr & Rognes (1995) similarly
found that intercultural groups of Mexicans and Norwegians achieved lower joint profit
than intracultural groups of Norwegians. More recently, Brett and Okumura (1998) found
that intercultural negotiations between U.S. and Japanese managers realized less joint
gains than intracultural negotiations between Japanese managers or intracultural
negotiations between American managers. Americans in particular had poor judgment
accuracy of Japanese negotiatorsâ priorities of issues.
Why is it that intercultural negotiators are less able to achieve mutually beneficial
outcomes compared to negotiators whose counterparts are from the same culture? Several

4

<-----Page 12----->explanations can be identified in the literature. First, from a cognitive perspective, it
seems that intercultural negotiators have difficulty developing a shared understanding of
the task at hand. For example, Brett and Okumura (1998) argued that U.S. and Japanese
negotiators bring different culture-specific schemas to the negotiation table which creates
major communication inefficiency. Indeed, they found that American negotiators who
value individualism had a higher self-interest schema than the Japanese who value
collectivism, and Japanese negotiators who value hierarchy had a higher power schema
than American negotiators who value egalitarianism. Similarly, Gelfand and McCusker
(2002) argued that different culture-specific metaphoric mappings of the negotiation
create different goals, scripts, and feelings in negotiation which makes it especially
difficult to organize social action (Weick, 1979). For example, Americans operating
under a sports metaphor may unconsciously assume that the goal of the negotiation is to
conduct a performance contest, the script to emphasize aggressive behavior in which
sportsmanship is expected, and feelings such as satisfaction to result from winning. In
contrast, the Japanese operating under a household gathering metaphor may assume the
goal of the negotiation is to ensure continuity and harmony of the group, the script to
emphasize face-saving where aggression is eschewed, and feelings such as satisfaction to
result from role fulfillment. Cai (1998) found empirical support for this notion
specifically in terms of goals; U.S. negotiators focused more on achieving short-term,
instrumental goals, whereas Taiwanese negotiators focused on long- term, global goals.
In a laboratory study, Gelfand, Nishii, Godfrey, and Raver (2003) found that metaphoric
similarity in negotiation was indeed an important predictor of joint gain. In so much as
intercultural negotiatorsâ metaphors differ, there is an extra hurdle that must be overcome

5

<-----Page 13----->which intracultural negotiators do not face; that is, intercultural negotiators first need to
ânegotiate the negotiationâ, or come to a shared understanding of what kind of task the
negotiation situation is about in terms of goals, scripts, and feelings on top of addressing
the actual negotiation issues themselves.
Second, from a skill-based perspective, intercultural negotiators may lack the
behavioral flexibility in overcoming their habitual, culturally normative behaviors, thus
creating potential for misunderstanding. For example, from the Brett and Okumura
(1998) dataset, Adair et al. (2001) found that American and Japanese negotiators use
different normative types of integrative behaviors in order to create joint gain in their
respective cultures. Americans, who come from a low-context culture normatively
engaged in high frequencies of direct communication behaviors (e.g. priority
information) where their intended meaning is explicitly portrayed in their messages that
are spoken. The Japanese, however, who come from a high-context culture engaged in
high frequencies of indirect communication behaviors (e.g. offers) in which the intended
meaning is carried through the context of the messages given. The authors also found that
in intercultural settings, the Japanese adapted their behaviors to the American direct
approach, whereas Americans did not adapt and continued to use their habitual direct
behaviors. Despite the Japanese negotiatorsâ efforts, however, Americans still had
misunderstandings of their counterparts, as indicated by their use of repetitive,
confirmatory, and clarifying questions. It is interesting to note looking across these two
studies that even though Japanese intercultural negotiators had accurate understanding of
their American counterpartsâ issue priorities, as well as being able to behave the
âAmericanâ way, it was not enough for intercultural negotiators to achieve the same level

6

<-----Page 14----->of joint profit as compared with American or Japanese intracultural negotiators.
This leads to a third explanation for why intercultural negotiations are particularly
difficult compared to intracultural negotiations. That is, motivation may be an additional
factor that is necessary for integrative success. For example, it is possible that Japanese
intercultural negotiators did not act on their judgment accuracy to create high joint gains
because they were not as motivated as Japanese intracultural negotiators to reach
integrative agreement (Adair et al. 2001). It is a well documented finding in social
psychology that people are much more comfortable interacting with ingroup members
(Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Furthermore, incongruent cognitive structures and normative
behaviors are more likely to make intercultural negotiations more stressful than
intracultural negotiations (George, Jones, & Gonzalez, 1998; Kumar, 1999), making it
especially difficult for intercultural negotiators to persist seeking integrative outcomes.
Clearly, when bargaining across the cultural divide, negotiators experience
considerable cognitive, motivational, and behavioral challenges which can impede the
negotiation process, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, in trying to improve
intercultural negotiation effectiveness, the two relevant questions are: What does an
effective negotiation process look like, and what individual differences might help
intercultural dyads to achieve this effective process? In the next section, we focus on the
first question and review the U.S. literature on negotiation process to show that
coordinated and synchronized behaviors that lead to optimal outcomes are reflected in
certain types of strategic sequencing of negotiation behaviors. We then argue that in
intercultural contexts, negotiators that are able to achieve high joint profit are those who
are able to develop and maintain a stable pattern of cooperative social interaction despite

7

<-----Page 15----->cultural differences, through the use of integrative sequences of information behaviors as
well as cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors. After the next
section on negotiation process, we then explore CQ as a potential individual difference
variable that may predict such sequences in intercultural negotiations.
Negotiation Process: Strategic Sequences
In the U.S. literature, the process of negotiation, or the ways in which negotiators
exchange information through communication in their search for an agreement, has
received considerably less research attention than have negotiation inputs (e.g. negotiator
characteristics, styles, cognitions, motives) and outcomes of negotiation (e.g. individual
and joint profits) (Weingart & Olekalns, 2004). However, there is wide agreement among
researchers in this burgeoning literature that stable and organized social action between
two negotiators is reflected in certain types of strategic sequencing of behaviors. Strategic
sequences alter the context of the negotiation and shape the subsequent outcomes that are
obtained (Brett, Shapiro, Lytle, 1998; Kelley, 1997; Neale & Northcraft, 1991; Putnam,
1990; Roloff, Tutzauer, & Dailey, 1989). For example, reciprocal sequences refer to
negotiators matching each otherâs moves exactly (e.g. priority information eliciting
priority information), and is interpreted as evidence that negotiators hold a high level of
shared understanding of the negotiation task (Putnam, 1990; Weingart & Olekalns, 2004).
Reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors in particular move the negotiation down a
cooperative path increasing the likelihood of maximizing joint gain (Weingart &
Olekalns, 2004). There is robust empirical evidence showing that reciprocating
integrative tactics generate high joint outcomes (Adair, 2003; Olekalns & Smith, 2000;
Weingart, Prietula, Hyder, & Genovese, 1999; Weingart & Olekalns, 2004; Weingart,

8

<-----Page 16----->Thompson, Bazerman, & Carroll, 1990). Furthermore, complementary sequences refer to
negotiators not matching each otherâs moves exactly, but pairing similar tactics that have
the same strategic focus, that is, tactics of either integrative or distributive categories. For
example, priority information followed by a multi-issue offer has the same strategic focus
of being integrative, yet is not identical. Adair and Brett (2005) and Adair et al. (2001)
remarked that particularly in international negotiations, complementary sequences could
also signal a shared cooperative understanding of the task, if parties enact integrative
intentions but with different culturally normative kinds of behaviors.
Clearly, sequencing integrative behaviors while negotiators maintain a mutually
shared understanding of the negotiation as a cooperative problem-solving activity move
them towards integrative agreements. However, particularly for intercultural negotiators,
integrative sequences should be much more difficult to maintain, given the cognitive,
behavioral, and motivational barriers discussed previously. For example, from a
behavioral skill-based perspective, if a low-context American negotiator intends to be
cooperative and directly asks his or her counterpart about issue priorities, and the highcontext Japanese negotiator also intends to be cooperative but indirectly answers with a
multi-issue offer, the American not knowing how to correctly attribute meaning to the
indirect behavior may misjudge that the Japanese negotiator is being competitive by
avoiding the question and in turn, break the sequence of cooperative behaviors by
responding negatively. Evidence for difficulties in synchronizing behaviors in
intercultural contexts was indirectly found in Adair and Brettâs (2005) study where they
observed that intercultural dyads took longer than intracultural dyads to reach stable
interaction patterns. Furthermore, it stands to reason that divergence in the content of

9

<-----Page 17----->cognitive structures is also an obstacle for maintaining sequences of integrative
behaviors. For example, if one negotiator implicitly focuses on short-term, instrumental
goals whereas the other focuses on long-term, relational goals, the misalignment of the
two goals should make synchronization of behaviors more difficult than when the goals
are aligned. Finally, if negotiators lack the motivation or persistence in interacting with
people from different cultures in the first place or easily becomes unmotivated because of
cultural barriers, the already fragile process of sequencing behaviors becomes unlikely to
occur.
We argue then, that for intercultural negotiations to be effective, dyads would
ideally consist of negotiators who have the capabilities in overcoming the cognitive,
motivational, and behavioral hurdles mentioned above and are able to maintain
sequencing of integrative behaviors. Furthermore, we argue that in addition to integrative
sequences which focus on information exchange and is strictly task focused, effective
intercultural negotiators would manage the relationship to maintain the fragile
cooperative context and engage in sequences of cooperative relationship-focused
comments throughout the negotiation (e.g. non task-focused expressions of enthusiasm
for working together). Thus, in our study we focused on sequences of integrative
information behaviors and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors,
which we expected to influence both objective and subjects aspects of negotiation
outcomes. For negotiation outcomes, our main focus was on joint profit but we also
examined relational capital (Gelfand et al., 2006), or the quality of the on-going
relationship alongside joint profit. Subjectively measured outcomes such as relational
capital is increasingly recognized by scholars as an important criterion since negotiation

10

<-----Page 18----->effectiveness is both the cause and consequence of the working relationship (e.g. Allred,
Mallozzi, Matsui, & Raia, 1997; Gelfand et al., 2006; Greenhalgh & Kramer, 1990;
Kramer & Messick, 1995).
Below, we argue that CQ will predict both integrative sequences of information
behaviors as well as cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors, which
in turn will lead to joint profit and relational capital in intercultural negotiation (see figure
1). Before we present our theory as to why CQ is beneficial, we will first discuss the
construct of cultural intelligence in detail and review empirical findings on CQ in the
next section.
Cultural Intelligence
Construct of CQ

Cultural intelligence (CQ), defined as a personâs capability in successfully
adapting to new cultural settings (Earley & Ang, 2003) was developed as a construct to
address a question shared by many international HR managers: Why is it that some
individuals who sometimes appear to be lacking social skills within their own culture
adjust easily, quickly, and entirely to new cultures whereas other individuals, even those
who possess high interpersonal skills within their own cultures, do not (Earley & Ang,
2003)? In response to this need of understanding individual differences in cultural
adaptation, Earley and Ang (2003) conceptualized CQ as a multi-faceted characteristic
consisting of meta-cognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral components.
The meta-cognitive facet of CQ refers to the level of cultural mindfulness during
intercultural interactions (Ang, Van Dyne, & Koh, 2004). People who are high on metacognitive CQ engage in higher-order thinking which involves the active control over
11

<-----Page 19----->cognitive processes engaged in learning about a new culture. In other words, individuals
with high meta-cognitive CQ plan how to approach learning about the new culture,
monitor their own comprehension, and evaluate their own progress towards
comprehending the new culture. Meta-cognitive CQ is especially an important
component of cultural intelligence for several reasons: 1) it promotes active thinking
about people and situations in foreign cultural settings; 2) it prevents reliance on rigid,
culturally bounded thinking and assumptions; and 3) it drives individuals to revise their
strategies so that they are more likely to experience successful cross-cultural interactions
(Ang et al., 2004).
Whereas meta-cognitive CQ involves higher-level cognitive processes, cognitive
CQ refers to acquired knowledge about a particular culture. This includes declarative
knowledge, which refers to knowing about things such as a new cultureâs economic,
political, and legal systems, as well as procedural knowledge which refers to knowing
how to do things within a new culture. Declarative knowledge can be acquired through
observation or by directly asking host nationals, whereas procedural knowledge can be
obtained through mimicry. Cognitive CQ is important for cultural intelligence because
individuals can gain a better understanding of the systems that shape specific patterns of
social interaction within a culture (Ang et al., 2004).
Motivational CQ emphasizes a personâs values and self-efficacy in adapting to
new cultures. Individuals with high motivational CQ are genuinely interested and are
open to new cultural experiences. They are also highly self-efficacious about crosscultural interactions and strongly believe in their own ability to deal with different
perspectives of others, unfamiliar situations, and handle complexity and uncertainty.

12

<-----Page 20----->When individuals with high motivational CQ face obstacles or failures, they reengage
with perseverance rather than withdrawing from the task. Motivational CQ is important
for cultural intelligence because it triggers effort and action as well as expanding and
intensifying a personâs search for the best way to adapt to new cultural environments
(Earley & Ang, 2003).
Finally, behavioral CQ refers to the extent to which an individual acts
appropriately, both verbally and non-verbally, in new cultural contexts (Ang et al., 2004).
Individuals with high behavioral CQ are flexible and change their behaviors to meet the
needs of a particular cultural situation. More specifically, they are sensitive to the range
of behaviors that are enacted, the culture-specific display rules for nonverbal expressions,
and the meanings that are attributed to certain non-verbal behaviors. Furthermore,
knowing and wanting to elicit the right response is not enough for behavioral CQ; one
must overcome already learned habits and elicit the appropriate response.
Empirical Findings on CQ

Given the infancy of the construct, empirical research on CQ is sparse, yet
evidence for its predictive validity is growing. For example, in a series of studies, Ang,
Van Dyne, Koh and Ng (2004) found that CQ significantly predicted task performance
and adjustment in situations of cultural diversity among undergraduates, international
executives, and foreign professionals. In one study, they gave undergraduates a cultural
judgment and decision-making task where participants were required to read five cultural
interaction scenarios and select the best response that explained the situation. Metacognitive and cognitive CQ significantly predicted cultural judgment and decisionmaking over and beyond demographic characteristics and cognitive ability.

13

<-----Page 21----->In a second study, business executives of various nationalities participated in an
executive development program on cultural intelligence. They were assigned to
intercultural dyads and given an assignment where they were required to analyze a
business scenario for developing a vacant piece of land in a culturally diverse part of
Singapore. Their tasks consisted of convincing landowners that their plan had both
marketing and financial viability. Each intercultural dyad wrote a business proposal and
gave a presentation of their proposal at the end of the program. Peers rated each
individualâs task performance. It was found that meta-cognitive and behavioral CQ
predicted task performance, and motivational and behavioral CQ predicted general
adjustment.
In study three, foreign professionals completed an online survey on general, work,
and interaction adjustment, and each professionalâs supervisors rated his or her work
performance. Meta-cognitive CQ and behavioral CQ predicted work performance while
motivational and behavioral CQ predicted all three types of adjustment, over and beyond
demographic characteristics.
In another study, Templer, Tay, and Chandrasekar (2006) examined the utility of
motivational CQ in predicting general and work adjustment over and beyond realistic job
previews (RJP) and realistic living conditions previews (RLCP) among expatriates. As
hypothesized, the authors found that motivational CQ was positively related to general
and work adjustment over and beyond the two types of job previews as well as gender,
age, time in host country, as well as prior international assignments.
In sum, the predictive validity of CQ has been shown in many samples, (i.e.
undergraduates, expatriates, foreign professionals, international executives) using many

14

<-----Page 22----->criteria (i.e. cultural judgment tasks, quality of business proposals developed through
collaborative intercultural interaction, adjustment in foreign assignments), and over and
beyond other constructs (i.e. demographics, intelligence, international experience). In the
next section, we argue that CQ is also beneficial in the context of intercultural
negotiations.
Cultural Intelligence and Intercultural Negotiation Effectiveness
Based on the previous discussion, we postulated that intercultural dyads with high
CQ will be able to organize social action and engage in more sequences of integrative
information behaviors and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors,
allowing them to achieve high negotiation outcomes compared with dyads with low CQ.
Hypothesized effects are summarized in figure 1.
Hypotheses: CQ and Strategic Sequences

First, we expected that when dyads consist of individuals with high CQ, they will
engage in more sequencing of integrative information exchange behaviors than when
dyads consist of individuals with low CQ. Because high CQ individuals enjoy interacting
with people from other cultures, they are more likely to adopt a cooperative approach to
negotiating. In addition, high CQ individuals, with their meta-cognitive abilities are
acutely aware that culture may cause potential misunderstandings in intercultural
contexts. Thus, they will question their own cultural assumptions as well as draw on their
existing knowledge of other cultures to try to understand their counterpartsâ cultural
assumptions. Furthermore, high CQ individuals possess a wider range of behaviors they
can accurately interpret as well as enact and are less prone to threats that throw

15

<-----Page 23----->intercultural negotiators out of sync. For example, using the previously mentioned
example of a direct question about issue priorities being followed by an indirect multiissue offer, high CQ Americans are more likely to be able to recognize that people from
high context cultures use indirect communication as a way to provide information and
correctly attribute the indirect tactic as cooperative, as well as still being able to glean
information that is present in the context of the messages given. Finally, high CQ
individuals are more likely to persist even if the negotiation becomes stressful and
difficult given their high motivation in intercultural situations.
Thus, based on the previous discussion, we predicted that CQ predicts sequences
of integrative information behaviors. We examined integrative sequences in two ways:
reciprocal integrative sequences which occur when a certain negotiation tactic is
followed by an identical negotiation tactic, and complementary integrative sequences
which occur when a negotiation tactic is followed by a different negotiation tactic, but of
the same general integrative information strategy. Furthermore, borrowing from Adairâs
(2003) approach, we studied sequencing as they occurred at immediate and delayed time
lags.
H1. Dyads with higher CQ will engage in higher frequencies of immediate and/or
delayed reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors than dyads
with lower CQ.
H2. Dyads with higher CQ will engage in higher frequencies of immediate and/or
delayed complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors than
dyads with lower CQ.
Second, in addition to engaging in sequences of integrative information behaviors

16

<-----Page 24----->that are task-focused, we expected dyads with high CQ to manage the relationship itself
by engaging in more sequences of cooperative comments (e.g. expressions of enthusiasm
for working together, cooperative acknowledgement of anotherâs perspective) that
reinforce the cooperative context of the negotiation than dyads with low CQ. Although
this type of sequencing has not been examined before in the literature, we expected it was
another way in which high CQ individuals, who are conscious of potential cultural
misunderstandings and stress that can arise out of intercultural interactions, to effectively
buffer the negotiation.
H3. Dyads with higher CQ will engage in higher frequencies of immediate and/or
delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors than dyads
with lower CQ.
Hypotheses: Strategic Sequences and Negotiation Outcomes

In the negotiation process literature, it has generally been found that sequences of
cooperative behaviors lead to joint profit (Adair, 2003; Olekalns & Smith, 2000;
Weingart et al., 1999; Weingart & Olekalns, 2004; Weingart et al., 1990); however, most
studies examining this relationship have been conducted in U.S. intracultural settings.
Weingart and Olekalns (2004) argue that more research needs to examine the strategic
sequenceâoutcome relationship as they occur in different negotiation contexts. Thus, in
this study, we examine the relationship between strategic sequences and joint profit as
they occur in the intercultural context. Based on the previous U.S. finding that generally,
sequences of cooperative behaviors lead to joint profit, we predicted the following:
H4. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors will achieve higher

17

<-----Page 25----->joint profit.
H5. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors will achieve
higher joint profit.
H6. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused behaviors will
achieve higher joint profit.
Furthermore, alongside joint profit, we examined dyad-level relational capital, or
what Gelfand et al. (2006) define as âthe relational assets that accumulate within a
specific dyadic negotiation relationshipâ (p.11), more specifically consisting of mutual
liking, knowledge, trust, and commitment to continuing the relationship. Subjective
outcomes such as relational capital are increasingly recognized by scholars as an
important criterion since negotiation effectiveness is both the cause and consequence of
the working relationship (e.g. Allred et al., 1997; Gelfand et al., 2006; Greenhalgh &
Kramer, 1990; Kramer & Messick, 1995). We generally expected that intercultural dyads
that engage in sequences of both integrative information behaviors as well as relationship
management behaviors would gain higher relational capital.
H7. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors will achieve higher
relational capital.
H8. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors will achieve
higher relational capital.

18

<-----Page 26----->H9. Dyads that engage in higher frequency of immediate and/or delayed
cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors will achieve higher
relational capital.
Control Variables: Other Individual Difference Constructs

In examining whether CQ predicts the above-mentioned sequences, we included
other individual difference constructs as controls. Although there is no other empirical
study linking other individual differences to strategic sequences, we felt it was important
to control for them, given evidence of individual differences predicting integrative
outcomes and that these effects may have been mediated by the sequencing of behaviors.
For example, Barry and Friedman (1998) found that specifically in integrative
bargaining, dyad-level cognitive ability predicted the level of joint gain. The authors also
found that extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness did not help joint
outcomes; however in a distributive bargaining context, extraversion and agreeableness
were liabilities. Furthermore, Foo, Elfenbein, Tan, & Aik (2004) found that higher
average emotional intelligence predicted better joint gain. Finally, Ma & Jaeger (2005)
found that among Chinese negotiators, openness to experience was positively related to
self-reported integrative behaviors and extraversion was positively related to both selfreported integrative and competitive behaviors. Thus, in our study, we controlled for
cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, openness to experience, extraversion, empathy,
and international experience in testing whether CQ predicts sequences of integrative
information behaviors and sequences of relationship management behaviors. Given that
CQ specifically deals with overcoming cultural problems and is more conceptually
relevant to the intercultural negotiation context than the other individual difference

19

<-----Page 27----->constructs, we expected CQ to have predictive power over and beyond these other
individual differences. In order to provide a strong test of CQâs predictive power of
strategic sequences over and beyond these other constructs, we included all six controls
in our analyses.
Exploratory Analyses

In addition to the hypothesized relationships, we examined two exploratory
questions. First, although our theory was kept at the overall CQ level, we examined
which of the four CQ facets influence sequences of integrative information behaviors and
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors. We were interested in
exploring what specific facet could have more predictive power over others. For example,
although having the ability to think meta-cognitively about culture, having extensive
knowledge about other cultures, and being able to adapt behaviorally are most likely
important in maintaining strategic sequences, it could be that these factors have little
effect if the negotiatorsâ motivation to interact with people from different cultures is
absent in the first place.
Second, we explored the effects of dyad composition of CQ on strategic
sequences; that is, whether it takes one high CQ negotiator or two high CQ negotiators to
have a positive impact on engaging in sequences of integrative information behaviors as
well as relationship management behaviors. Given that strategic sequencing is a
conjunctive task (Steiner, 1972) in which contributions from both negotiators are required
for high performance, it is possible that a dyadâs level of strategic sequencing depends on
the lowest level of CQ within the dyad, or in other words, the âweakest linkâ. That is,
even if one negotiator possesses high CQ, as long as the other negotiator has low CQ and

20

<-----Page 28----->does not contribute to the joint activity of reciprocating integrative as well as cooperative
behaviors, the dyad may still suffer as a result. Thus, in sum, we explored the effects of
specific facets of CQ, as well as the dyad composition of CQ, on sequences of integrative
information behaviors and sequences of relationship management behaviors.

21

<-----Page 29----->Chapter 2: Method
Participants
150 students (75 Americans and 75 East Asians) at both undergraduate and
graduate levels were recruited through flyers, listservs, and newspaper advertisements at
a large university in Maryland. For the American sample, the advertisement specifically
targeted âAmerican citizens of western European descentâ and for the East Asian sample,
those who have âlived in the U.S. for less than five years and are originally from China
(including Taiwan), Japan, or Koreaâ. All students were given a $20 cash card for use at
the campus bookstore for participation. The American sample consisted of 29 males and
46 females, and the mean age was 26.9 years old. The East Asian sample consisted of 28
males and 47 females, and the mean age was 26 years old. American and East Asian
students were first matched on sex and level of education (graduate or undergraduate),
and then randomly paired to form 75 intercultural negotiation dyads. Within the dyad,
participants were randomly assigned to one of two negotiator roles. 10 dyads had at least
one member who did not give consent to the use of their digitally-recorded process data.
Thus, 10 dyads were excluded from analyses with a final dyad-level sample size of 65,
consisting of 130 individuals.
Procedure
The study took part over two sessions, each session separated by a minimum of
one week. On the first day, participants were asked to fill out an online questionnaire
from home that assessed all individual difference characteristics, except for cognitive
ability which involved a timed test, and could not be conducted online. On the second

22

<-----Page 30----->day, participants were asked to come into the laboratory to role-play a negotiation
simulation. Participants first read their role and task information and filled out a prenegotiation planning sheet individually. After being reminded to take their negotiation
roles seriously, participants were brought together with their partners from the other
culture to role-play a 20-minute negotiation while being digitally tape-recorded. At 15
minutes into the negotiation, participants were given a reminder that there were five
minutes remaining. After the negotiation session, both negotiators filled out a final
agreement form that indicated the level of settlement reached for each negotiation issue.
Negotiators were then separated to fill out a post-negotiation questionnaire that assessed
subjective negotiation outcomes. After filling out the post- negotiation questionnaire,
participants were timed for 12 minutes to complete a test of cognitive ability. Finally,
participants were fully debriefed on the purpose of the study.
Negotiation Task
The negotiation simulation was adapted from Towers Market II, used in previous
research on integrative bargaining (Weingart, Olekalns, & Smith, 2004), and involved
one participant playing the role of a specialty grocery shop owner, and the other
participant playing the role of a specialty wine shop owner. Participants were told that a
successful real estate company has proposed developing a multifunctional market that
consists of a wine store and a grocery store under one roof with common dÃ©cor but with
separate areas for their respective top-quality products. Participants were told that they
were seriously interested in the shared market but needed to negotiate five unresolved
issues with the other vendor: 1) Hours of Operation, 2) Renovation Costs, 3) Floor
Space, 4) Temperature, and 5) Grand Opening Date.

23

<-----Page 31----->Each participant was given role instructions that included a payoff schedule that
listed the five possible levels of settlement on each of the five negotiation issues and the
number of points associated with each level of settlement within an issue. Points
indicated the amount of worth of that level of settlement to the negotiator (see table 1).
Depending on which negotiation role the participant played, different negotiation issues
were most important and least important to the negotiator. For example, for the grocery
shop owner, the most important issue was the Grand Opening Date (with the best
settlement option September 1 worth 400 points), whereas for the wine shop owner, the
most important issue was the Renovation Cost (with the best settlement option $30,000
also worth 400 points). Thus, negotiation issues Grand Opening Date and Renovation
Cost were integrative issues where negotiators could identify differences in priorities and
make tradeoffs. Hours of Operation and Temperature were distributive issues in which
the payoff for one negotiator was diametrically opposite of the other negotiator, and Floor
Space was a compatible issue where the payoff structure was identical for both
negotiators. In order to ensure that participants understood the payoff schedule, a quiz
was included in the role instructions which asked participants to calculate the total
number of points that would be gained given a specific settlement across the five issues.
If participants got the answer incorrect, they were asked to review the task instructions
again.
Coding of Negotiation Behaviors at the Tactical Level
Coding Scheme

Process data from the digital tape-recordings of negotiation sessions were
transcribed, unitized, and coded. The coding scheme was adapted from one developed by
24

<-----Page 32----->Weingart and colleagues for their Towers Market II negotiation simulation (cf. Weingart
et al., 2004; see appendix A for 37 tactic codes and definitions).
Coding Process

After all of the process data had been transcribed, the negotiation dialogue was
unitized and coded at the thought-unit level, where a thought-unit refers to one thought or
idea which roughly corresponds to a sentence. Through multiple half-day practice
sessions, three research assistants were trained on how to unitize the negotiation dialogue
into thought units. Initial practice sessions were conducted as a group in order for
research assistants to develop a collective understanding of how to deal with difficult
cases such as when one thought unit was expressed repeatedly in multiple sentences, as
well as when multiple thought units were expressed within one sentence. Research
assistants were trained until they reached a high level of unitizing reliability then unitized
their own batch of transcripts. Three full transcripts were randomly chosen for all
research assistants to unitize before each unitized their own batch. Between all pairs of
research assistants, Guetzkowâs U (Guetzkow, 1950) was calculated, which is the
difference between the number of units identified by an independent coder and the âtrueâ
number of units (i.e. the average of the two codersâ estimates). The average Guetzkowâs
U between all pairs of research assistants, for any one of the three full transcripts was
under 0.06, indicating high unitizing reliability (Guetzkow, 1950).
Once all process data had been unitized, two coders blind to all research
hypotheses content-coded the negotiation transcripts at the tactical level. Again, coders
were trained through multiple half-day practice sessions, this time specifically on how to
apply the coding scheme. During the practice sessions, coders independently worked on

25

<-----Page 33----->their own, and then compared their answers in order to resolve disagreements and
develop a collective understanding of each tactical code. At the end of the practice
sessions, the two research assistants coded three randomly drawn full transcripts. The
average inter-rater reliability of the three transcripts was high, with Cohenâs K = 0.88. 1
Operationalizing Frequencies of Strategic Sequences: Sequences of Integrative
Information Behaviors and Sequence of Cooperative Relationship Management
Behaviors
Grouping of Negotiation Tactics into Strategic Clusters

Once all negotiation behaviors for each speaking turn within a dyad were coded at
the tactical level as listed in appendix A (e.g. states preference within a single issue,
states priority information across two or more issues, etc.), all 37 negotiation tactics were
conceptually grouped into strategic clusters, which was the level of abstraction in which
strategic sequences were defined (see below for details). First, the strategic cluster of
integrative information included the following negotiation tactics: a) states preference
within a single issue, b) states priority information across two or more issues, c) asks a
question about otherâs issue preference, d) asks a question about otherâs priority across
two or more issues, e) notes issue difference with sympathy, f) notes similarity in issue
preference or priority, g) suggests compromise or willingness to concede, h) suggests
package tradeoff of two or more issues, i) expresses positive reaction to issues, j) makes
multi-issue offer, and k) suggests reciprocity. We conceptualized integrative information
more broadly than is typically done in U.S. negotiation research which focuses primarily
on direct ways of conveying information (i.e. statements and questions about issue
preference and priorities, and stating issue differences and similarities), by including
26

<-----Page 34----->integrative tactics that allowed for more indirect ways of conveying information which is
more common in East Asian cultures (Adair et al., 2001; Adair, 2003; Adair & Brett,
2005). We reasoned that in intercultural contexts, it is more realistic that high CQ
negotiators would use a wider repertoire of behaviors in exchanging information than
solely relying on direct behaviors that are normative in the U.S. Thus, in examining
integrative processes, it is important to not only include Western derived measures of
integration but also Eastern derived measures of integration, lest the measure be biased.
Thus, we also included the following tactics as integrative information: suggests
compromise or willingness to concede; suggests package tradeoff of two or more issues;
expresses positive reaction to issues; makes multi-issue offers; and suggests reciprocity,
as they all convey information about oneâs issue preferences or priorities in an indirect,
implicit way.
Second, in order to examine the negotiation process in terms of not only taskfocused integrative information behaviors but of how negotiators manage their
relationships with each other, we added the strategic cluster of cooperative relationship
management, which included the following negotiation tactics: a) makes off-task
comments about cooperation, b) notes mutual interdependence, and c) comments that
validate otherâs perspective. Finally, other negotiation tactics were also grouped into
strategy clusters of distributive information and competitive non-information (see
appendix A); however, given that there were no significant results on these variables,
they will not be discussed further.
Definition of Sequence of Integrative Information Behaviors: Reciprocal and Complementary.

Sequences of integrative information behaviors occurred when a specific

27

<-----Page 35----->negotiation tactic falling within the strategy cluster of integrative information (elicited by
negotiator 1), was followed by another negotiation tactic also falling within the strategy
cluster of integrative information (elicited by negotiator 2). As previously mentioned,
sequences of integrative information behaviors were examined in two ways: 1) reciprocal
sequences of integrative information behaviors and 2) complementary sequences of
integrative information behaviors (Weingart & Olekalns, 2004). A reciprocal sequence
of integrative information behaviors occurred when the two negotiation tactics
comprising the sequence were identical (e.g. negotiator 1 states issue preference 
negotiator 2 states issue preference). For each dyad, reciprocal sequences for each
negotiation tactic within the integrative information strategy were counted and summed
to give an overall count of reciprocal sequences across all tactic types. A complementary
sequence of integrative information behaviors occurred when the two negotiation tactics
comprising the sequence were not identical (e.g. negotiator 1 asks a question about
otherâs priority across two or more issues  negotiator 2 states priority information
across two or more issues), but were of the same integrative information strategy. In sum,
both reciprocal and complementary sequences involve sequences of negotiation tactics
that fall under the integrative information strategy cluster. However, reciprocal sequences
involve two identical negotiation tactics whereas complementary sequences involve two
different negotiation tactics.
Definition of Sequences of Cooperative Relationship Management Behaviors

Sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors occurred when any
negotiation tactic falling within the strategic cluster of cooperative relationship
management (elicited by negotiator 1) was followed by any negotiation tactic also falling

28

<-----Page 36----->within the strategic cluster of cooperative relationship management (elicited by
negotiator 2). An example is when negotiator 1 makes a miscellaneous cooperative
comment and is followed by negotiator 2 also making a miscellaneous cooperative
comment.
Counting Sequences at Immediate and Delayed Time Lags

In determining the frequency of each type of sequences for all dyads, reciprocal
sequences of integrative information behaviors, complementary sequences of integrative
information behaviors, and sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors
were all counted at immediate and delayed time lags, as done by previous research
(Adair, 2003; Adair & Brett, 2004). Immediate time lags occurred when the tactic elicited
by negotiator 1 is immediately followed in the next speaking turn by the tactic elicited by
negotiator 2. Delayed time lags occurred when the tactic elicited by negotiator 1 is
followed three speaking turns afterwards by the tactic elicited by negotiator 2.
As an illustration, suppose C represents a cooperative relationship management
tactic, O represents some other tactic, and the subscripts one and two represent the
negotiator within the dyad. If we are interested in counting the number of immediate
cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors, the negotiation pattern of
C1C2O1C2O1 has one immediate cooperative sequence of relationship management
behaviors among four total sequences at the immediate time lag (i.e. C1C2, C2O1, O1C2,
C2O1). However in counting the number of delayed cooperative sequences of relationship
management behaviors, the same negotiation pattern would also count one delayed
cooperative sequence of relationship management behaviors, this time between two total
sequences at the delayed time lag (i.e. C1C2O1C2, C2O1C2O1). As such, raw dyad

29

<-----Page 37----->frequencies were counted for reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors,
complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors, and cooperative
sequences of relationship management behaviors at both immediate and delayed time
lags. This was done automatically for each dyad, using Bakeman and Queraâs (1995)
General Sequential Querier software program.
To control for the total number of speaking turns across dyads (i.e. the length of
the negotiation), the raw frequencies for each type of strategic sequence was converted
into relative frequencies (c.f. Adair, 2003; Adair & Brett, 2005). More specifically, the
raw frequency of immediate strategic sequences was divided by the dyadâs total number
of speaking turns â 1, whereas the raw frequency of delayed strategic sequences was
divided by the dyadâs total number of speaking turns â 3. Because small proportions can
pose statistical challenges, the relative frequencies were then logit-transformed to stretch
the tails of the distribution as recommended by Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003).
Examining the Latter Two-Thirds of the Negotiation Transcript

Given that it takes time for negotiatorsâ patterned behaviors such as strategic
sequences to emerge, especially in intercultural contexts (Adair & Brett, 2004; 2005), and
that it also takes time for individual differences to surface and impact social integration in
group contexts (Harrison, Price, Gavin, & Florey 2002), we examined whether CQ
predicts integrative and relationship management sequences at the latter two-thirds of the
negotiation. Borrowing Adair and Brettâs (2005) approach, we divided each dyadâs full
transcript into thirds based on the total number of speaking turns, and counted the relative
frequencies of each type of strategic sequence as they occurred in the latter two-thirds of
the negotiation. Tests of our hypotheses were also conducted examining strategic

30

<-----Page 38----->sequences that occurred in the full negotiation; however, results were stronger focusing
on the latter two-thirds of the negotiation. Thus, we present the results for the full
negotiation for the interested reader in appendix B; however, we focus our analyses and
discussion looking at the latter two-thirds of the negotiation.
Individual Difference Measures
Cultural Intelligence (CQ)

CQ was assessed using a 20-item four-factor measure developed by Ang et al.
(2004, see appendix C for items), and used by others for empirical research (Ang, Van
Dyne, & Koh, 2006; Templer et al., 2006). Evidence for factor equivalence in two
samples (Singapore and U.S.), acceptable reliability, temporal stability, and crossvalidation for the measure can be found in a series of studies conducted by the authors.
Ang et al. (2004) first generated a pool of 53 items based on the cross-cultural
adjustment literature and interviews with eight executives with extensive international
work experience. Three researchers and three other international executives with crosscultural expertise then independently assessed the items for relevance, clarity, and
fidelity. They also rated each item for consistency with definitions of the four factors of
CQ. For each factor, 10 best items were retained, forming the initial 40-item CQ scale.
Next, 576 undergraduate students in Singapore completed the 40-item CQ scale.
Principle axis factor analysis with varimax rotation demonstrated factor loadings for 24
items in four primary factors with 62.9% of overall variance explained. Confirmatory
factor analysis using a second sample of Singaporean undergraduate students
demonstrated that the 24-item measure had moderate fit, but a 20-item measure, used in
this study, had a significantly better fit. Reliabilities for this 20-item scale were
31

<-----Page 39----->acceptable in Ang et al.âs (2004) sample: Î±Meta-cognitive = 0.76 for four items, Î±Cognitive =
0.84 for six items, Î±Motivational = 0.77 for five items, and Î±Behavioral = 0.84 for five items. In
addition, the authors examined the temporal stability of the CQ scale. Participants
completed the 20-item CQ scale for the second time four months after the first
assessment, and results showed factor invariance across time. Finally, for crossvalidation, Ang et al. had 337 American undergraduates complete the 20-item CQ
measure and found strong support for invariance in factor structure, factor loadings, and
factor covariances across the U.S. and Singapore. In a separate study examining the
personality antecedents of CQ, Ang et al. (2006) replicated these results providing
additional evidence for the four-factor model of CQ.
In the present study, overall CQ had high reliability (Î±American = 0.90; Î±East Asian =
0.86). Example items include âI am conscious of the cultural knowledge I apply to crosscultural interactionsâ for meta-cognitive CQ (four items; Î±American = 0.84, Î±East Asian = 0.83
), âI know the legal and economic systems of other culturesâ for cognitive CQ (six items;
Î±American = 0.80, Î±East Asian = 0.78), âI enjoy interacting with people from different
culturesâ for motivational CQ (five items; Î±American = 0.86, Î±East Asian = 0.70), and âI
change my verbal behavior when a cross-cultural interaction requires itâ for behavioral
CQ (five items; Î±American = 0.87, Î±East Asian = 0.77), to which participants indicated their
extent of agreement from (1) âstrongly disagreeâ to (7) âstrongly agreeâ.
Furthermore, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the
dimensionality of the 20 CQ items from Ang et al.âs (2004) scale. Given that individual
items tend to have low reliabilities and often violate assumptions of multivariate
normality, we used the parceling method, where item clusters or âparcelsâ are used as

32

<-----Page 40----->indicators instead of individual items (Bandalos, 2002; Nasser & Wisenbaker, 2003). In
order to create parcels, for each CQ facet, exploratory factor analysis was conducted with
maximum likelihood estimation specifying one factor, in order to identify items with high
factor loadings and lower factor loadings. For meta-cognitive CQ with a total of four
items, two parcels were created with two items each, each parcel being the average of an
item with a higher factor loading and an item with a lower factor loading. Similarly for
cognitive CQ with a total of six items, three parcels were created with two items each.
For motivational and behavioral CQ with a total of five items respectively, three parcels
were created with two items each, but the third parcel representing the one item with the
median factor loading. Specifying a model where the parcels load onto relevant CQ
facets, and where all CQ facets load onto overall CQ, the overall fit of the model was
good (Ï2 [40] = 73.46, p = 0.00; CFI = 0.95; SRMR = 0.08; RMSEA = 0.08).
International Experience

Both international travel experiences and international living experiences were
measured. Borrowing from Takeuchi, Tesluk, Yun, and Lepak (2005), participants were
asked to list, in chronological order from most recent to least recent, the countries and
duration of each type of international experience that that they considered important. All
travel and international experiences were summed respectively, and converted to weeks.
Openness to Experience

Openness to experience was measured with 10 items from Goldbergâs short
version of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, 2006). An example item is, âI
spend time reflecting on thingsâ (Î±American = 0.75, Î±East Asian = 0.82), answered on a (1)

33

<-----Page 41----->âvery inaccurateâ to (5) âvery accurateâ scale.
Extraversion

Extraversion was also measured with 10 items from Goldbergâs short version of
the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP, 2006). An example item is, âI am the life of
the partyâ (Î±American = 0.88, Î±East Asian = 0.89).
Empathy

Empathy was measured with Davisâ Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI, 1983),
consisting of 28 items (Î±American = 0.78, Î±East Asian = 0.77). Participantsâ responses were
made on a five-point scale ranging from (0) âdoes not describe me wellâ to (4) âdescribes
me wellâ. An example item includes, âI believe that there are two sides to every question
and try to look at them both.â
Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence was measured using Schutte et al.âs (1998) 33-item scale
that was developed based on Salovey and Mayerâs (1990) conceptualization of the
construct (Î±American = 0.87; Î±East Asian = 0.91). An example item is âWhen I experience a
positive emotion, I know how to make it lastâ, and was administered on scale from (1)
âstrongly disagreeâ to (5) âstrongly agreeâ.
Cognitive Ability

Cognitive ability was measured using the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT, 2000),
a 12-minute speed test consisting of 50 questions that assesses an individualâs math and
verbal abilities. 2

34

<-----Page 42----->Outcome Measures
Joint Profit

Joint profit was measured summing the total number of points in the payoff
schedule earned by both negotiators within a dyad.
Relational Capital

Relational capital (Gelfand et al., 2006) was measured with 12 items written for
this study, tapping negotiatorsâ mutual liking, trust, understanding, and commitment to
their future relationship (see appendix D; Î±American = 0.88, Î±East Asian = 0.91).
Demographics
Five demographic variables were measured at the dyad-level: dyad sex (1=female,
2=male), dyad level of education (1=undergraduate, 2=graduate), dyad mean age (years),
negotiation experience (1=no, 2=yes), and the East Asianâs length of stay in the U.S.
(months).

35

<-----Page 43----->Chapter 3: Results
Descriptive Statistics
All individual difference scores and relational capital scores were aggregated to
the dyad-level by averaging the two negotiatorsâ scores. Means, standard deviations, and
dyad-level inter-correlations for the individual difference measures, strategic sequences,
outcomes, as well as demographic variables are shown in table 2. None of the
demographic variables were significantly correlated with negotiation processes or
outcomes, except for dyad sex and joint profit (r (62) = 0.35, p < 0.01), where male dyads
achieved higher joint profit than female dyads. In terms of individual differences and
strategic sequences, there were a number of notable significant correlations: CQ and
immediate complementary sequences of integrative behaviors (r (65) = 0.32, p < 0.05),
CQ and delayed complementary sequences of integrative behaviors (r (65) = 0.31, p <
0.05), openness and immediate reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors (r (65) =
0.32, p < 0.05), and emotional intelligence and immediate complementary sequences of
integrative behaviors (r (65) = 0.25, p < 0.05).
Tests of Hypotheses Using Multiple Regression
All hypotheses, each representing a path in the model in figure 1, were tested
using multiple regressions. Subsequently, a post-hoc path model was fit based on
significant regression paths found (see below).
Overall CQ and Negotiation Process

Hypothesis 1 predicted that dyads with higher overall CQ will engage in more
immediate and/or delayed reciprocal (i.e. identical) sequences of integrative information

36

<-----Page 44----->behaviors than dyads with lower overall CQ, over and beyond international experience
(i.e. travel and living experiences), personality (i.e. openness, extraversion, empathy) and
intelligence constructs (i.e. emotional intelligence and cognitive ability). The results in
table 3 show that overall CQ did not significantly predict reciprocal sequences of
integrative information behaviors at immediate (Î² = 0.08, p > 0.60) or delayed time lags
(Î² = 0.18, p > 0.15). Thus, hypothesis 1 was not supported.
Hypothesis 2 predicted that dyads with higher overall CQ will engage in more
immediate and/or delayed complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors
than dyads with lower overall CQ, over and beyond international experience (i.e. travel
and living experiences), personality (i.e. openness, extraversion, empathy) and
intelligence constructs (i.e. emotional intelligence and cognitive ability). Table 4 shows
that dyad overall CQ did predict reciprocation of complementary integrative behaviors at
immediate (Î² = 0.32, p < 0.05) and delayed (Î² = 0.33, p < 0.05) time lags. Thus,
hypothesis 2 was supported.
Hypothesis 3 predicted that dyads with higher overall CQ will engage in more
immediate and/or delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused
behaviors than dyads with lower overall CQ, over and beyond international experience
(i.e. travel and living experiences), personality (i.e. openness, extraversion, empathy) and
intelligence constructs (i.e. emotional intelligence and cognitive ability). Table 5 shows
that dyad overall CQ is not significantly related to the reciprocation of cooperative
relationship management-focused behaviors at immediate (Î² = 0.22, p > 0.10) or delayed
(Î² = 0.22, p > 0.10) time lags. Thus, hypothesis 3 was not supported.

37

<-----Page 45----->Negotiation Process and Outcomes

Hypothesis 4 predicted that immediate and/or delayed reciprocal sequences of
integrative information behaviors would be positively related to joint profit. Having
included reciprocal, complementary, and cooperative relationship management sequences
in the regression equation, table 6 shows that there was no significant relationship
between reciprocal sequences and joint profit at immediate (Î² = 0.05, p > 0.70) or
delayed (Î² = 0.14, p > 0.30) time lags. Thus, Hypothesis 4 was not supported. Hypothesis
5 predicted that immediate and/or delayed complementary sequences of integrative
information behaviors would be positively related to joint profit. There was a positive
significant relationship at the immediate time lag (Î² = 0.30, p < 0.05). Thus, hypothesis 5
was supported. Hypothesis 6 predicted a positive relationship between immediate and/or
delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors and joint profit.
Hypothesis 6 was not supported as there were no significant relationships at the
immediate lag (Î² = 0.12, p > 0.30) or delayed lag (Î²= 0.09, p > 0.40).
Hypothesis 7 predicted that immediate and/or delayed reciprocal sequences of
integrative information behaviors would have a positive effect on relational capital. Table
7 shows that having entered sequences of reciprocal, complementary, and cooperative
relationship management behaviors together into the regression equation, reciprocal
sequences did not predict relational capital at immediate (Î² = 0.14, p > 0.2) or delayed (Î²
= -0.07, p > 0.50) time lags. Thus, hypothesis 7 was not supported. Hypothesis 8
predicted that immediate and/or delayed complementary sequences of integrative
behaviors would have a positive effect on relational capital. There was no significant
relationship at the immediate (Î²= 0.01, p > 0.9) or delayed (Î²= 0.08, p > 0.50) time lags.

38

<-----Page 46----->Thus, hypothesis 8 was not supported. Finally, hypothesis 9 predicted that immediate
and/or delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management behaviors have a
positive effect on relational capital. Hypothesis 9 was supported as there were significant
effects at both immediate time lags (Î²= 0.42, p < 0.01), and delayed time lags (Î²= 0.33, p
< 0.01). In sum, the regression coefficients from the multiple regression results for the
hypothesized model is shown in figure 2 (immediate time lag) and figure 3 (delayed time
lag).
Post-hoc Model Modification and Overall Fit
Based on the significant regression coefficients found in figure 1, the overall fit of
a simplified model (figure 4) was assessed using path modeling (cf. Schneider, Ehrhart,
Mayer, Saltz, & Niles-Jolly, 2005). We used the path model approach instead of the
traditional Baron and Kenny test of mediation (1986) since the initial variable CQ, and
the outcome variable, joint profit, were not significantly correlated. Establishing such a
bivariate relationship between the initial variable and the outcome variable is the first
step in establishing mediation in Baron and Kennyâs (1986) approach. However, as
argued in Schneider et al. (2005), a number of scholars have questioned whether it is
necessary to provide evidence for the first step to establish mediation (Collins, Graham,
& Flaherty, 1998; MacKinnon, 2000; MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000; Shrout &
Bolger, 2002), when the crucial steps are establishing the relationship between the initial
variable and the mediator, and the relationship between the mediator and outcome
variable (Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). Furthermore, MacKinnon, Lockwood,
Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002) argued that a simultaneous test of significance of the
path from an initial variable to a mediator and the path from the mediator to an outcome

39

<-----Page 47----->(i.e. path modeling), relative to other approaches (such as Baron and Kennyâs test)
provides the best balance of type I error rates and statistical power.
In the post-hoc path model, including all control variables would have created too
large a model to test given the small sample size. Thus, it was necessary to first partial
the influences of the covariates from all model variables. Recent simulation studies have
demonstrated the appropriateness of this practice, as structural coefficients were found to
be virtually equivalent, whether the researcher directly models the covariates, or employs
SEM using partial covariances (Fletcher, Germano, & Selgrade, 2006; KammeyerMueller & Wanberg, 2003; Newcomb & Bentler, 1988). Partial covariances in this study
were created by regressing the model indicators (CQ, immediate complementary
sequences of integrative information behaviors, and joint profit) onto all covariates (i.e.
travel experience, living experience, openness, extraversion, empathy, emotional
intelligence, and cognitive ability) individually and then saving the residual covariances.
The simplified model fit the data well (Ï2 [1] = 1.33, p = 0.25; CFI = 0.97; SRMR =
0.054; RMSEA = 0.073). Estimated path coefficients are found in figure 4. Thus, results
show that higher the CQ, dyads engage in more sequences of complementary integrative
information behaviors, which in turn leads to high joint profits.
Exploratory Analyses
CQ Facets

Do specific CQ facets predict strategic sequences? We conducted additional,
multiple regression analyses to address this issue, entering all four CQ facets and all
control variables into the regression equation. At immediate time lags, meta-cognitive

40

<-----Page 48----->CQ increased reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors (Î² = 0.42, p <
0.05). For complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors, motivational
CQ was found to drive the significant overall CQ effect (Î² = 0.42, p < 0.01).
Furthermore, behavioral CQ was found to increase reciprocity of cooperative relationship
management-focused behaviors (Î² = 0.36, p < 0.05). At delayed time lags, cognitive CQ
had a marginally significant, positive relationship with complementary sequences of
integrative information behaviors (Î² = 0.25, p < 0.10). There were no significant effects
between CQ facets and delayed reciprocal sequences of integrative information
behaviors, nor delayed cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused
behaviors. Figure 5 presents overall significant results for CQ facets predicting strategic
sequences at the immediate time lag. Based on significant paths found in figure 5, we
assessed the overall fit of a simplified SEM model including meta-cognitive CQ,
motivational CQ, behavioral CQ, immediate reciprocal sequences of integrative
information behaviors, immediate complementary sequences of integrative information
behaviors, immediate cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused
behaviors, joint profit, and relational capital. The simplified model fit the data well (Ï2
[17] = 13.74, p = 0.69; CFI = 1.00; SRMR = 0.08; RMSEA = 0.00). Estimated path
coefficients are found in figure 6.
Dyad Composition

Does it take one or two negotiator(s) for CQ to be advantageous in increasing
sequences of reciprocal/ complementary integrative information behaviors as well as
sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors? We first addressed this
issue by examining the relationship between the dyad minimum score on overall CQ (i.e.

41

<-----Page 49----->the lower of the two negotiatorsâ overall CQ score) and each type of behavioral sequence
at immediate and delayed time lags. For minimum overall CQ, the pattern of results was
almost identical to those obtained with overall mean CQ. Minimum overall CQ did not
predict reciprocal sequences of integrative information behaviors (Î²immediate= 0.16, p >
0.20; Î²delayed= 0.20, p > 0.15). However, it did have a significant positive relationship
with complementary sequences of integrative information behaviors (Î²immediate= 0.32, p <
0.05; Î²delayed= 0.39, p = 0.01). Thus, this result suggests that the extent to which dyads
engage in complementary sequences of integrative behaviors is only as good as its lowest
CQ negotiator.
Finally, minimum overall CQ did not have a significant relationship with
cooperative sequences of relationship management-focused behaviors, although the
results became marginal (Î²immediate = 0.26, p < 0.10; Î²delayed = 0.27, p < 0.10). Next, we
examined the relationship between dyad maximum overall CQ and each type of
behavioral sequence at immediate and delayed time lags. Maximum overall CQ did not
predict any of the strategic sequences at immediate (Î²identical = -0.05, p > 0.70;
Î²complementary= 0.15, p > 0.20; Î²cooperative = 0.07, p > 0.60) nor delayed time lags (Î²identical =
0.07, p > 0.50; Î²complementary= 0.10, p > 0.50; Î²cooperative = 0.05, p > 0.70).

42

<-----Page 50----->Chapter 4: Discussion
In this paper, we argued that there is a fundamental paradox in the culture and
negotiation literature, where there is a dearth of research addressing the question of what
predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness, despite researchersâ long-time recognition
of the practical importance of this question. We proposed cultural intelligence as a
promising predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness. More specifically, we
postulated that dyads high in CQ are better equipped with the cognitive, motivational,
and behavioral skills necessary in overcoming cultural barriers such as clashing schemas
and metaphors, reduced persistence, and the deciphering and enacting of culturally nonnormative behaviors. As such, we argued that high CQ negotiators will be able to develop
a shared understanding of the negotiation as a cooperative problem-solving activity, as
reflected in their strategic sequencing of integrative information behaviors as well as
cooperative relationship management behaviors, which in turn predict negotiation
outcomes. Moreover, we expected CQ to predict strategic sequences over and beyond
other related but distinct constructs including international experience, personality and
intelligence.
Overall CQ, Complementary Sequences of Integrative Behaviors, and Joint Profit
The results of an intercultural negotiation study between Americans and East
Asians, where CQ and other individual differences were measured one week prior to the
negotiation partially supported these notions. The most important finding was that
consistent with our theory, dyad-level CQ predicts immediate complementary sequences
of integrative behaviors, which in turn predicts joint profit. Moreover, CQ predicted

43

<-----Page 51----->complementary sequences of integrative behaviors over and beyond international travel
and living experiences, openness, extraversion, empathy, emotional intelligence, and
cognitive ability.
This main finding simultaneously makes contributions to several streams in the
broader literature. First, it adds to the culture and negotiation literature by showing that
CQ is a key predictor of the extent to which intercultural negotiators exchange
information in their search for integrative agreement. Thus, in response to Krayâs (2005)
earlier suggestion that ânegotiation scholars might consider expanding beyond simple
demonstrations of [cultural] differencesâ¦and explore whether awareness of these
differences makes a differenceâ (p.159) in influencing the effectiveness of intercultural
negotiations, we show with CQ that it does indeed make a difference. As such, our study
begins to address the question of what predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness,
which so far has remained a black box in the culture and negotiation literature.
Second, this study provides additional evidence for the predictive validity of CQ,
specifically in a negotiation context. The CQ literature thus far has focused mainly on the
usefulness of CQ predicting outcomes such as adjustment and business performance in
expatriate management contexts involving samples of expatriates, foreign professionals,
and international executives. In our study, we show that CQ is also advantageous for
intercultural negotiation, which involves complex decision-making between two parties
who both attempt to resolve perceived incompatible goals. Furthermore, by showing that
CQ predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness over and beyond other individual
difference constructs such as international experience, personality, and other types of
intelligence, we add further validity to Earley and Angâs (2003) CQ construct.

44

<-----Page 52----->Third, we also make a contribution to the negotiation literature by furthering our
understanding of the negotiation process which there is little understanding of in the U.S.
literature and even more so in the cross-cultural literature. By directly examining the
negotiation process of strategic sequencing of integrative behaviors, we provide an indepth, dynamic view of how such a communication pattern mediates the effect of a
previously unexamined negotiation input, CQ, on joint profit, the negotiation outcome.
Facet-level CQ, Strategic Sequences, and Outcomes
Our exploratory analyses also revealed that a different facet of CQ predicts each
of the three negotiation sequences. First, dyads high in motivational CQ engaged in more
immediate complementary sequences of integrative behaviors. Although it is reasonable
to expect that all of the CQ facets would predict complementary sequences based on our
previous theorizing, it may be that motivational CQ has the strongest predictive power
because having the underlying motivation in the first place for interacting with people
from different cultures is more fundamental to cultural adjustment than the adaptive
thoughts and behaviors that may consequently follow from having high motivational CQ.
Interestingly, this finding parallels U.S. research on self-efficacy and negotiation, which
found that having the confidence and anticipation of successful performance in
integrative bargaining buffer negotiators from negative effects of impasse. For example,
self-efficacious negotiators were less likely to experience negative emotions and
perceptions of negotiation counterparts as not being interested in reaching mutually
beneficial outcomes, which paved the way to more open information exchange
(OâConnor & Arnold, 2001). Similarly, our finding illustrates that self-efficacy
specifically for cross-cultural encounters, is key to developing and maintaining

45

<-----Page 53----->sequences of information exchange behaviors in an intercultural context where cultural
barriers most likely pose stress and frustration upon negotiators.
Second, we also found that dyads high in behavioral CQ engaged in more
immediate cooperative sequences of non-task-focused relationship management
behaviors, which in turn led to relational capital. This finding is comparable to recent
findings on non-conscious mimicry, or the automatic matching of verbal and non-verbal
behaviors between interaction partners. Research has shown that the conscious goal of
getting along with another increases mimicry (Lakin & Chartrand, 2003), and that
mimicry in turn acts as a âsocial glueâ in binding people together and creating
harmonious relationships (Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, & Chartrand, 2003). Indeed, there is
evidence that mimicry increases cooperative behavior (e.g. prosocial helping) and
enhances liking and rapport (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, & van Knippenberg,
2004). Our finding on behavioral CQ can be interpreted similarly, in that in intercultural
contexts, negotiators with high behavioral CQ focus their conscious efforts on adapting to
the other party and can better mimic their verbal and non-verbal behaviors (e.g. use of
tone, pause, silence, facial expressions, rates of speaking) because of their wider
repertoire of culturally non-normative behaviors. As such, negotiators with high
behavioral CQ seemed to have developed greater rapport with their counterparts as
indicated by their sequencing of relationship management behaviors, which in turn, led to
high relational capital.
There were also several unexpected findings in our study. First, although it is
reasonable to expect motivational CQ to also predict sequences of cooperative
relationship management behaviors, and behavioral CQ to also predict complementary

46

<-----Page 54----->sequences of integrative behaviors, there were no such significant relationships. Second,
motivational CQ, which had a positive relationship with complementary integrative
sequences as mentioned above, did not have a significant relationship with reciprocal
integrative sequences. One can only speculate as to why such is the case. It may be that
because of low statistical power due to our small sample size, relationships that actually
exist are not being detected. Furthermore, regarding the absence of relationship between
motivational CQ and reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors in particular, it is
possible that with reciprocal sequences, the negotiation process is being represented at
too fine a detail, as matching of behaviors were counted at the negotiation tactical level.
In contrast, for complementary sequences, matching of behaviors was counted at the
strategic level; that is, even if two different tactics occurred in sequence, they were
counted as a complementary sequence as long as they belonged to the same strategic
cluster of integrative information behaviors. Thus, the looser structure of complementary
sequences may be representing more of a theoretically meaningful construct of
integrative sequences than reciprocal sequences. Based on this interpretation, although
there was an additional significant relationship between a specific CQ facet, metacognitive CQ, and reciprocal sequences of integrative behaviors, we remain cautious in
making theoretical interpretations of this particular relationship. In order to clarify
relationships among specific facets of CQ and strategic sequences, future research is
needed where these relationships are tested with larger sample sizes, with strategic
sequences being measured at varying levels of abstraction.
Finally, while we hypothesized that sequences of integrative behaviors would lead
to both joint profit and relational capital, and that sequences of relationship management

47

<-----Page 55----->behaviors would also lead to both joint profit and relational capital, we did not find such
a pattern. We found that sequences of integrative behaviors only predicted joint profit,
whereas sequences of cooperative relationship management behaviors only predicted
relational capital. This finding attests to the recent arguments raised by researchers on the
importance of distinguishing objective and subjective negotiation criteria. Developing
and maintaining a shared understanding of the negotiation as a cooperative problemsolving activity where negotiators exchange information does not necessarily guarantee a
very high quality relationship consisting of mutual liking, trust, understanding, and
commitment to a future relationship in intercultural contexts. In parallel, developing and
maintaining sequences of non-task-focused miscellaneous comments that maintain a
cooperative relationship does not necessarily lead to obtaining high joint profit.
Dyad Composition
In terms of dyad composition, the pattern of significant results for dyad
mean CQ and dyad minimum CQ (at the overall level) predicting strategic sequences at
both immediate and delayed time lags looked almost identical, whereas dyad maximum
CQ did not have any significant associations with any of the sequences. The results
suggest that the negotiator with the lower CQ level has more of an impact on the extent to
which the dyad engages in complementary sequences of integrative behaviors than the
negotiator with the higher CQ level. This makes sense given the conjunctive nature of the
task (Steiner, 1972); that is, sequencing integrative behaviors is a joint task that requires
the contributions of both negotiators. Thus, the dyad-level performance can only be as
good as its âweakest linkâ; even if one negotiator within the dyad has high CQ and tries
to adopt an integrative strategy with the goal of becoming synchronized with the other, if

48

<-----Page 56----->the other negotiator does not reciprocate integrative behaviors, overall, the dyad still
suffers as a result. In sum, it is not enough to just have one high CQ negotiator, the ability
level of the low CQ negotiator influences the extent to which the dyad engages in
integrative sequencing.
Practical Implications
The practical implication of our research is that CQ is a key predictor of
intercultural negotiation effectiveness on which individuals can be selected and/ or
trained. Given that negotiation is a ubiquitous pattern of social interaction, and that
globalization is increasingly infiltrating many parts of the world, it is likely that the
selection and training of CQ will be advantageous for intercultural negotiations not only
organizational contexts (e.g. inter-organizational relations, manager-subordinate
relations, industrial relations), but also in other areas such as international relations (Pruitt
& Carnevale, 1993). For example, Triandis (1994) anecdotally argued that in the early
1990s just before the Gulf War, one of the problems in the intercultural negotiations
between former secretary of state James Baker and former foreign minister of Iraq, Tariq
Aziz, was that Bakerâs emotional style of being calm and not raising his voice was
misattributed by Aziz to mean that Americans were not serious about using military force
in Iraq. Thus, even in political arena among diplomats, it stands to reason that training
CQ would lead to better intercultural negotiation outcomes.
Specifically in organizational contexts, managers can rely on a number of ways to
assess overall CQ for selection or training, in addition to self-report measures (Earley &
Ang, 2003). For example, direct observations of intercultural negotiators allow assessors
to gather information on individualsâ CQ by observing good and problematic behaviors

49

<-----Page 57----->as they occur in real-time. Furthermore, by using cultural assimilators, assessors can
present problematic intercultural negotiations between actors and have participants make
correct attributions and interpretations of the actorsâ behaviors. In addition to overall CQ,
managers can also train specific facets of CQ as it applies to intercultural negotiations.
For example, meta-cognitive CQ can be increased through cognitive behavior
modification, a technique that raises conscious awareness of oneâs automaticity of
thoughts and behaviors (CBM; Mahoney, 1974; Meichenbaum, 1974), motivational CQ
can be increased through goal-setting (Locke & Latham, 1990), cognitive CQ can be
increased by reading about other cultures or talking to past negotiators with intercultural
experience, and finally, behavioral CQ can be acquired through behavior change
principles such as identifying antecedents and consequences of oneâs own culturespecific negotiation behaviors (Westmacott & Cameron, 1981).
Limitations and Future Research
All research methods have limitations (McGrath, Martin, & Kulka, 1982), and
this study is no exception. We studied one sample, students, with one methodology, labbased negotiation simulation. Therefore, it is necessary to exercise caution in applying
our results. However, we are hopeful that our findings will generalize to intercultural
negotiators in organizational and even political settings for two reasons. First, the
majority of our students consisted of older graduate students who most likely can relate to
real-world experiences such as negotiation. Second, given that culture has been found to
pervasively influence behavior in a wide variety of settings (Markus, Kitayama, &
Heiman, 1997), it stands to reason that the extent to which individuals are intelligent
about culture and its impact on behavior should also be consistent across diverse

50

<-----Page 58----->intercultural settings. In addition, while we are optimistic about our results, we used a
self-report measure of CQ given the methodological infancy of the construct. However,
given the label of âcultural intelligenceâ and the conceptualization of the construct as an
ability, we realize the necessity for future research to measure CQ with other, more
objective methods to provide converging evidence for the predictive power of CQ on
intercultural negotiation effectiveness. Finally, our study had low statistical power due to
a small sample size. Nonetheless, we found some significant effects despite a
conservative test; therefore, we expect even stronger results should future research
replicate our study with larger sample sizes.
There are several fruitful avenues for future research. It would be interesting to
move beyond the negotiation process of strategic sequencing which focuses on
negotiatorsâ shared understanding of the task at a more micro level, to negotiation phases,
which examines intercultural negotiatorsâ synchronization of behaviors at a more
aggregate level. Using a technique called phase mapping (Poole, 1983; Poole & Roth,
1989), researchers can identify what kind of phases emerge specifically in intercultural
contexts, and how they differ between high CQ and low CQ dyads. For example, high
CQ negotiators may be able to develop and transition through clearly demarcated,
functional negotiation phases at a steady pace as they become highly synchronized with
each other and move towards resolution, whereas low CQ negotiators may remain
disorganized and disintegrated throughout the negotiation, leading eventually to
suboptimal outcomes.
Furthermore, it would be fascinating to examine the âdark sideâ of CQ. That is,
the context of the negotiation in this study specifically focused on integrative deal-

51

<-----Page 59----->making where negotiators cultivate relationships in order to reach agreement. In contrast,
negotiations can also take place in more competitive contexts such as disputing in which
negotiatorsâ relationships are dissolving from rejected claims and negative emotions
(Gelfand, Brett, Imai, Tsai, & Huang, 2006). Thus, it would be interesting to see how CQ
manifests itself in such non-cooperative contexts. For example, do high CQ individuals
take advantage of their extensive cultural knowledge and behavioral flexibility to try to
deceive low CQ individuals? Or, does CQ always entail a cooperative, global-minded
value system which would then suggest that CQ is a liability in competitive contexts?
Additionally, future research can integrate CQ with the negotiation literature on
cognitive biases. In our study, we did not directly examine how CQ may influence
negotiatorsâ underlying psychological mechanisms. Yet, given that high CQ individuals
should be able to question their own cultural assumptions, it would not be surprising if
CQ buffers negotiators from culture-specific cognitive biases (e.g. fixed-pie bias,
fundamental attribution error, self-serving assessments of fairness) that are prevalent in
competitive, individualistic cultures such as the U.S (see Gelfand & Dyer, 2002 for
review). It would be useful to examine if intercultural negotiatorsâ mutual reduction in
such culture-specific cognitive biases mediate the relationship between CQ and
synchronization of behaviors.
Finally, the vast majority of intercultural negotiation studies have focused on
interactions between Americans and East Asians, and this study is no exception. Future
research should move beyond examining Pacific Rim cultures to see if the positive
effects of CQ on intercultural negotiation effectiveness generalize to U.S. negotiations
with other cultures as well. For example, despite the state of current U.S. foreign affairs,

52

<-----Page 60----->there are virtually no negotiation studies involving Middle Eastern cultures. Given that
there are large cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East on a wide
variety of value dimensions (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman & Gupta, 2004), it is
likely that there are many sources of cultural barriers that must be overcome in U.S.â
Middle Eastern intercultural negotiations.
Conclusion
This research expands the dominant paradigm in the culture and negotiation
literature by moving beyond cross-cultural comparisons of negotiation behaviors to
directly examining negotiation behaviors as they occur in intercultural contexts. This
study illustrates that CQ is a key predictor of intercultural negotiation effectiveness, as
dyads high in CQ were found to engage in more strategic sequencing of integrative
behaviors, which in turn led to high joint outcomes. Practically speaking, managers
should select and/or train CQ in individuals to maximize the chances of optimal
agreements in intercultural negotiations. Future research, such as examining the effects of
CQ on broader negotiation processes such as phases, the role of CQ in competitive
contexts such as disputing, and the effects of CQ on psychological mechanisms such as
cognitive biases, would help build a more comprehensive theory of cultural intelligence
and intercultural negotiations.

Because sequences of behavior across the two negotiators were of primary interest in this study,

when multiple codes at the thought-unit level occurred within a negotiatorâs speaking turn, it was necessary
to eliminate less substantial behaviors and assign one dominant code at the speaking-turn level. In order to
achieve a certain level of objectivity in deciding what code was dominant in the speaking turn, the first and
second authors went through a number of transcripts to achieve collective agreement on a dominance
scheme, similar to one used in previous research (Weingart, Bennett, Brett, 1993; Weingart, Prietula, &
Hyder 1999). Multi-issue offers were considered more dominant than substantiations that followed,
statements about issue preferences were considered more substantial than substantiations that followed, and
neutral miscellaneous statements were considered less substantial than all other codes.

For cognitive ability, preliminary analyses at the individual level indicated that East Asians

scored significantly lower than Americans (M East Asian = 24.67, sd = 4.57; M American = 31.49, SD = 4.75; t
(128) = -8.35, p < 0.01), most likely because the Wonderlic requires knowledge of difficult English
proverbs and idioms. To deal with this issue, raw scores were standardized into Z scores within each
cultural group to determine oneâs relative standing in cognitive ability within his or her racial group. Z
scores were subsequently aggregated to the dyad level.
